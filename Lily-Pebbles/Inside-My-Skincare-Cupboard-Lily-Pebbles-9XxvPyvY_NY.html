but I thought it would be fun if I gave
you a little tour of my skincare shelf
or shelves so if you want to come with
me into my bathroom I will show you
inside the cupboard come with me
so this is where I keep my main skincare
just in this mirrored shelf that's above
my sink I do have a bit of other
skincare in my Muji kind of drawers over
there that's kind of why I keep the
drugstore skincare products that I try
to recommend to you guys and any backups
I have but mainly the products I use are
high-end because I really like to invest
in my skincare I don't really buy
expensive shoes but I like to buy
expensive oils and moisturizers and
serums so I have like two main shelves I
have my morning routine on one shelf my
evening routine on the other and I
thought you guys might like to take a
peek inside yes sorry echoey bathroom
problems okay so let's look inside
Penza I like to use in the morning while
I use this morning and night but it is a
really nice one for morning as well as
the Askia Renaissance cleansing gel I
talk about this a lot it's a gel
cleanser that turns into an oil once you
rub it into the skin it removes I makeup
really well so you can use in the
evening but it's really gentle and
refreshing so I like to use this in the
morning but if I can't be bothered to
cleanse properly which is quite a lot of
the time I like to use my seller water
and I really like the LA roche-posay one
I'm definitely gonna repurchase that but
in the meantime I was actually sent this
one from Vichy so I thought I'd give it
a go it's their three-in-one one-step
cleansing micellar solution and it's
really nice and prefer the LA
roche-posay one but and this is good as
well so I'm not that fussy with these
sort of products so I just tend to work
through whatever I've got I've got a
couple of serums that I like to use at
the moment I'm trying the Askia get up
and glow which is the radiant energy and
protection booster and I really like
this I just love Askia as a brand this
has like a really cool like duo chrome
color to it so really instantly adds
like that glow to your skin you can
actually see it straightaway it's a
really nice serum I'm going through it
quite quickly not a massive fan of the
packaging because it's glass and the
pumps quite hard to use but it's a
really really nice serum so I'm using
that or the Sarah Chapman intense
hydrating booster which is just one of
my all-time favorites I think I'm on my
third bottle and I have a backup
just in case it's a really nice wet
serum some serums I feel like you need
to apply a lot but this one you just
need a couple of drops and it instantly
adds that hydration that my dehydrated
skin really craves I also have my Sarah
Chapman morning facial here which is a
morning oil I don't always use this but
if my skin's feeling really dry you just
need one pump and it's really nice
actually it's nice under makeup because
it makes the makeup sit quite nicely I
love her oils I love how overnight
facials so I do have the morning facial
which I use sometimes not kind of
definitely not everyday not even once a
week but whenever my skin feels like it
means it I also have this funny
contraption that I recently got from
origins and it's like a manual face
brush so it's like the Clarisonic but
manual and the bristles are really soft
and I didn't think I would like this
tool but I tried it with my cleanser I
actually really liked it kind of a nice
soft gentle way to exfoliate my skin has
been feeling a little bit bumpy recently
so I'm giving this a go to see if it
kind of removes any dead skin cells and
I really like it it's kind of like the
original Clarisonic without I really
don't like the Clarisonic so I kind of
like this I'm going to see how it goes
it feels a bit like cheap but it kind of
does the job and also on this shelf I
have my la roche-posay series ink which
is like a toner and I sometimes just
spritz this on before my moisturizer
after I cleanse he says it's a zinc
sulfate solution cleansing and soothing
I really like this I don't know really
if it does much but I kind of like the
step in my routine okay so now let's
look at the second shelf so this is the
second shelf and this is my evening
routine so there's obviously a lot more
products here because I tend to change
them up a bit more than evening I spend
more time on my skin in the evening in
the morning I'm just I'm not a morning
person so I kind of just wash and go but
in the evening I really like to look
after my skin so I have an eye makeup
remover this looks like the Charlotte
Tilbury one but actually finish the
Charlotte to everyone I just kept the
packaging because it has a really handy
pump that I quite like to use so in here
is actually the one from Lancome this is
the bi-facil non oily instant cleanser
sensitive eyes it's like one of those
duo things that you shake up and it's
blue I really like this actually I
prefer it at Charlotte Tilbury one I'd
say it's quite similar to the Karen's
well actually it's not that different
I'm still kind of using
used about the quarter so far but I
really like it and I've just kept it in
the Charlotte Tilbury packaging I also
have my EMA Hardy cleansing balm I like
to use this one in the evening when my
skin is feeling really dry because it's
very very hydrating and moisturizing
it's a cleansing balm it comes in this
very annoying tub but it's a really
really nice nourishing balm that takes
up all your makeup don't love using this
on my eyes I prefer to remove my eye
makeup separately and just use this on
my skin because it's quite hard to wash
out your eyes and I use this little kind
of spatula to get out the pot I have the
origin make a difference night to
moisturizer I'm not that fussy with
moisturizers in the evening and I really
liked origins moisturizers so I just use
that one and it smells good I just
realized that I didn't talk about my
morning moisturizer the Kate Somerville
one this is the moisturizer I use in the
morning is headphone milk moisturizer it
comes in this really cool packaging you
press it up and it comes out the middle
this is really nice you need a tiny bit
it'll-it'll goes a really long way and
my brother since before when I was last
in America and I really like it sorry
forgot to mention that ok back to the
evening I've got from first aid beauty
these facial radiance pads and this this
is the way that I like to exfoliate they
are pre soaked cotton pads you get a 60
in here and they last me really long
time I'll use these most evenings or
every other evening and I just run it
all over my skin it's a chemical
exfoliant it's not harsh at all first
day beauty is a great brand it's
fragrance very very kind of
non-offensive good for sensitive skin
and I really like these pads because
they're so easy to use and I feel like
they actually work and I also have from
first aid beauty I'm trying this out at
the moment it's the IGT triple remedy
overnight balm so it's a kind of balm
for your eyes which is nice it's a nice
texture it's kind of like a thick cream
kind of lip balm me texture and I just
run that under and over my eyes and it
feels good I'm a bit weird with eye
cream I just I don't know I gotta like
you can't see insta-results are a bit
lazy with my eye cream really so I'm
trying that one out but I haven't really
got one that I love I'm also at the
moment using this oil from Sunday Riley
I love night oils I've got the Sarah
Chapman overnight facial here which I've
been using for years now it's just a
lovely overnight oil I love it I'm also
trying this one
which is from Sunday Riley it's called a
lunar and it's the sleeping at night oil
it's blue which is crazy and it kind of
makes the skin a bit blue but you're
going to bed anyway so it doesn't matter
I've done a blog post on this with all
the ingredients and why I love it so I
will link that down below it's a really
really nice oil you can just feel it
instantly hydrates your skin and makes
my skin feel just really different I
love skin care you can instantly see
results and this is definitely one of
those I really really like it if I'm not
using the facial radiance pads and I
want to exfoliate I will sometimes use
the Sarah Chapman overnight exfoliating
booster so this is another one of her
serums the one I use in the morning is
step one and this is a number two so
this is an exfoliating serum which is
really interesting I always thought with
exfoliators you had to kind of I don't
know I just thought it was weird to
apply Seiran exfoliated because you know
when you wash off but it feels really
nice and my skin feels very smooth the
next day I love her serums I'm a huge
fan and guys know I don't use this as
much anymore but if my skin is really
plain up and feeding spot C which is a
little bit at the moment I've got a few
spots on my forehead I like to use the
Estee Lauder advanced night repair this
is such a cult Beauty classic everyone
loves it really ugly packaging and this
big brown bottle but it's just a really
nice kind of goopy serum um it's a funny
texture but it feels really nice on the
skin and I feel like this was a good one
my skin is playing up and I have another
one I use on my skin is playing up I
don't use this that much anymore but I
didn't want to get rid of it I recently
had like a bit clear out I didn't want
to get rid of this because I used to
really love it it's the Kiehl's
midnight recovery concentrate I don't
use it that much but I like to have it
there just for and I kind of wanna use
something that I used to love and it's
oil it feels more like an oil but again
I like to use it on my skin is playing
now also on the Shelf I have some no
Riley good jeans which I don't use that
much these days I find that it's quite
stinging it's a very very strong
products but if my skin is in relatively
good condition there's no kind of open
spots or anything that is going to sting
I like to use this as a treatment it's
very very powerful it says that
brightens exfoliates plumped lines even
hyperpigmentation and increases
circulation for instant radiance I do
you think this is better for siting
your skin my mom is obsessed with this
I'm probably a little bit young to be
using it so I don't use it that often
but every kind of other week I will give
it a little go and I do like what it
does to my skin so that's the tour of my
skincare cupboard I hope you guys
enjoyed it as I said I have a few other
products stashed away drugstore products
and backups and things that I've trying
but those are my two main shelves that I
use morning and night and I know how
nosy you guys like to be so I thought
you might like to see a peek inside
thank you so much for watching and thank
you guys for watching everyday May it's
been so fun so far you're vlogging every
day in case you don't know so I'm
