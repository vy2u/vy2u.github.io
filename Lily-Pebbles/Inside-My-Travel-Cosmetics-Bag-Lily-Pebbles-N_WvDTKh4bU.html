goes up I think I'm already back for my
very short trip to the South of France
but now while I'm filming this I haven't
gone yet and I thought I'd show you what
I'm packing in my travel cosmetics bag I
always like to watch these videos like a
little sneak inside someone's suitcase
I'm kind of nosy like that I think it's
kind of interesting and hopefully I can
give you some makeup packing tips along
the way so if you've seen my makeup bag
collection video you know I've got
hundreds of different makeup bags but
for this kind of trip I wanted to taste
something where I could put everything
in one and I have this little kind of
Travel cosmetics bag from Muji this is
the small version I think but I also
have the large and for this trip I'm
going to take the large one it's huge
it's hard
it doesn't squish in your case so it's
not perfect it's not that practical but
I like that everything's in one place me
and rich are going to share a suitcase
so hopefully this can just kind of sit
in the corner of the case somewhere this
is what it looks like so it's really
quite big actually and it's quite heavy
as I said it's not the perfect bag but
it'll do for this trip and I'm going to
show you what's inside so let's open it
up in here I've got my skincare makeup
body and brushes so the only thing that
isn't in here is tools
hair straighteners and epilator which
I'll just throw into the case at the end
and a hairbrush I'm not taking shampoo
and conditioner with me because I'm not
going to need to wash my hair I'm only
going for days my hair doesn't need to
be washed like it will last for days so
that is why there's no shampoo and
conditioner in there I like to pack my
makeup a certain way which I'll talk
about in a minute but with skincare and
body I just like to make a list I think
it's so much easier if you write
everything down on a list give
yourselves a little tick boxes and then
you won't forget whatever you need to
take with you so first of all let's talk
through the skincare when I go away I
try to take any travel minis that I have
but sometimes I don't always want to
switch up all of my skincare because I
just know that what works with my skin
and on this trip I wanted to take with
my Askia Renaissance cleansing gel but
the full-size packaging is just far too
large to take with I wish they did like
a travel size or one in the tube but I
just decanted some into a pot so you
feathers is quite a big pot could've
gone small I didn't have time but I
basically just put in I think 10 pumps
I've tried to do like 3 per application
and work out from there how much I need
I'll probably take a little spatula with
me just to scoop it out but you don't
need much I always made a mistake of
over filling these and then you
you have to kind of use this when you're
home against you don't to waste the
product so just take a small amount in a
pot I'm also taken with two muslin
cloths and just any old two that will
last me for the four to five days that
I'm there I've also taken some custom
wool pads and a mini travel Bioderma
because sometimes I like to remove my
eye makeup separate or if I'm lazy I'll
just use this to remove my makeup or
I'll use it in the morning and then for
the rest of my skincare I've just taken
some tatah Harper products which I got
in my cold Beauty hauls like a mini
starter set and these are so good for
traveling a little bit heavy because
they're glass but they're a good small
size so I've taken with the hydrating
floral essence which is a nice kind of
facial spritzer and the rejuvenating
serum and the reparative moisturizer so
these three are really small and they'll
just sit inside this little divider I
have from Muji and also in there is my
little travel toothpaste this is still
going for my last trip and my little
toothbrush head that goes on my electric
toothbrush my electric toothbrush is
from oral-b and it's quite big to take
away I don't if they do travel electric
toothbrushes that would be good because
I don't want to take with a manual
toothbrush I'm too used to using this
now my teeth would just feel gross if I
don't so I'm taking this with luckily I
don't have to take the charger because
this always lasts on a trip for me I
don't know why but it the charge is
really good and I'm taking with any
pills or medicine than they need for the
body I've got some Sun cream this is
salt Anna protect and moisturize SPF 30
which I'll use on my body and I've got
the soap &amp;amp; Glory clean girls body wash
which is just a travel size and I'm
itchin roll-on deodorant okay so when it
comes to packing makeup what I like to
do is just go to our makeup stash and
then just kind of act out what makeup I
would wear do the whole kind of process
and then take that with me so I'm taking
a face of makeup with a couple of I
options and a couple of lip options I
think that's the best way to do it it's
normally just my current makeup routine
what I'm loving at the moment depending
on the weather of the place that I'm
going so for this trip I'm taking with
me the Chanel SPF 50
the Charlotte Tilbury light wonder
foundation the Charlotte Tilbury retouch
a concealer the Clarins instant
concealer and then the Urban Decay all
nighter makeup setting spray which I
like to spray on at the end just to
refresh my skin for face products and
taking with the soap &amp;amp; Glory solar
powder bronzer the Stila water color
blush in shimmery Lotus and the
hourglass ambient
lighting powder because this is really
multi-purpose you can use as a setting
powder as a highlighter and I think it's
good to take away you have like three in
one for my eyes I'm taking with this Mac
deer that I put together which is patina
and caught a couple of by Terry Umbra
black stars misty rock and bronze moon
my Clinique high impact extreme volume
mascara and lower lash mascara my
anastasi of brow wiz and clear brow gel
and then for lips I'm taking with the
pink by terry lip balm clinic lipstick
in poppy pop and Mac lip liner in saw as
I'm picking out the different makeup
that I want to pack I just take the
brush that I'll be using with that so
I'm just taking a foundation brush
bronzer brush powder brush concealer
blush it and a few eye brushes I know
that most people take far less brushes
away with them but I love makeup brushes
and I feel like without the brushes the
makeups never as good this Muji bag has
space for brushes anyway so I figured I
might as well just fill it up with the
brushes I want to use for my travel
brushes are never as good if you guys
know any good travel brushes that are as
good as the full size please let me know
that is quite neat but at the end I like
to just mess it up and throw in a few
extra hair products my or by dry
texturizing spray I Bumble and Bumble
semi sumo a few clips and hair bands and
then I think that's all I need for my
hair so that's kind of everything in my
bag as I said I'm just taking a few
tools on the side feels like quite a lot
of stuff but I like that it's all in one
bag I'm only going for a long weekend
but I don't really know what I'm going
to be doing and I want to have my makeup
still nice so I hope you guys enjoyed
taking a little peek inside my travel
cosmetics bag I hope you enjoyed my
vlogs from France and I'll see you guys
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
