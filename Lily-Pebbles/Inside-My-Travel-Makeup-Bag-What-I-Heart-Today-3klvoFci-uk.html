my travel makeup bag I'm going to Berlin
on Wednesday in a couple of days for
like four days a really quick trip and I
usually just take a sip pop bag like
this to keep all my makeup in but I was
in Carnaby Street in London the other
night and it was twenty percent off all
the shops for like a special event so i
went into muji to have a look and i
actually found the most perfect travel
makeup bag ever i'm so happy i found it
it looks like this it's quite compact
and quite small good size it's got a
little handle and a pocket in the back
there so this is what it's like when
it's closed it's got a zip that goes all
the way around so I just open this up
for you so you unzip that that open up
it looks like this it's also got a
little hangy thing to put on the back of
a bathroom door I always think so useful
I really like that so this is what it
looks like and at the top here it's the
little mesh zip and and inside there are
like the little elastic things you can
put lipsticks and stuff in and they stay
in place in here I've got my dipped teak
fig perfume and I've got four lipsticks
quite excessive but everything else have
taken really basic makeup and it's just
lips I like this or switch up so I've
got my mac fanfare lipstick mac hot
gossip which is written there's pink and
Max syrup which I really like for every
day it's really easy and finally my
L'Oreal Rouge caress in day teen coral
just in case the weather's hot that's a
nice summary lip color so that's what I
keep in this top section and then just
here's a little sort of hidden zip and
in there I've just put my origins and
SPF moisturizer so in this bottom but
this is a bit I think it's really great
there's two sections on the side and
then there's those elasticated straps
all along the back a section
in the middle and another mesh section
at the front here so in these side
compartments on one side i keeping my
YSL foundation and the other side i'm
keeping my laura mercier primer and they
fit perfectly in there along the back
I'm keeping my bourgeois volumizing
mascara for the evenings and my makeup
forever smoky lash mascara for the
daytime I also have my HD brass bra beta
mai mua I primer my soap &amp;amp; Glory liquid
eyeliner my collection concealer in
three medium and I also brought with me
my by Terry and lip tint just because
it's quite good from great out for a
long day lasts all day and then I also
have in here my mini cordially beauty
elixir in this middle section down here
I've got a mac a eyeliner in feline and
my in blocks eyeshadow palette which is
just kind of got everything I need I'm
going to go for a few days and it's got
evening colors and daytime colors so
that's really good and then in this
front zip section here I've got my nas
powder just looks like this in flesh my
NARS Laguna bronzer my nas deepthroat
Russia which is my everyday very easy
wear blush my Gemma kid Julie glow in
rose gold and my Bobby Brown corrector
in like bisque that's everything all
that fits in this nice little compact
makeup bag and I just think it's so good
what I do keep it my makeup in a bag
like this I kind of have to rummage
through and try and find everything but
because when you open this is literally
everything is just sitting there really
easy to see and I absolutely love this
so it was 11 pounds but I twenty percent
off so it was about nine
something and such a good but I'd pay 11
pounds for it i think it's so good and
you should definitely think about
getting one of these if you are great
traveling i forgot to mention how I take
my brushes away with me and I got these
little zip bags from Muji ages ago I
think forward to America Christmas they
just had one of those little plastic he
zips and I think they are meant for
brushes but I mean they're quite small
I've got a couple of these and I just
take my brushes away any so that really
probably and disgusting but I just have
like my Real Techniques powder brush
buffing brush and blusher brush and then
I've got like a mini Becker blusher
brush a couple of mini mac brushes and
my mac 217 and 224 so those are how I
take my brush is just really small and
easy to fit in my case so yeah I really
like this and that's all the stuff that
I'm taking with me to Berlin not
counting like moisturizers and cleanses
and stuff i'm going to have a probably
put my skincare stuff in this bag
because that doesn't really need to be
neatly organized and so yeah that's
everything and i hope you've enjoyed
seeing other products I'm taking with me
I'll hopefully take a lot of photos on
there and put them my blog so i'll put
the link to my blog below this if you
want to go check those out and thanks
