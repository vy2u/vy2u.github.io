makeup bag the beautiful notes that I'm
taking away with me and my on flight
little PT bag
I've got also my kind of beauty stuff
like my shampoo and conditioner hair
stuff all that kind of stuff I should be
doing another video which is more like a
packing vlog on Sunday so all that stuff
will be in there but for this one I've
just got my makeup bag and my own flight
Beauty bag my brushes and a little extra
thing as well I just thought I'd do this
video because I love watching them and I
know a lot of you are gonna say that I'm
taking far too much makeup away with me
but even though I'm on holiday I like to
kind of have my options and I still want
to look good and I probably end up
hardly using any of these things but I
just like to have them and they're still
quite compact and so I'm going away
tomorrow I'm gonna start by showing you
my own flight bag which will be in my
hand luggage and I have it in this Muji
bag really really good for travel stuff
this is one of those guys it's the right
size for what you need because I know in
like Luton Airport is 2 pounds just for
a little rubbish plastic bag so it's
much better investment to get one of
these and kind of use it everytime you
go away the flight to Thailand is I
think 13 hours and I remember from last
time it's intense
I absolutely hate flying ok everything
about it
make it travel say I get claustrophobic
everything I'm just talking about it
it's making me feel ill so I thought I
would do my little beauty routine on the
flights and Lisa Eldridge did an amazing
video on this so I'll link that below
and it's partly because it's actually
quite nice and it's good for your skin
you get really dehydrated on planes so
it's partly for that reason but also
it's something to distract me from being
on a plane and it will take up a little
bit of time where I'm not panicking so
this is the bag that's gonna be in my
hand hug it and I'll show you what's in
this I'm just gonna grab stuff out of it
first thing my travel sickness pills
these are from bootstrap they're called
travel calm and they're the only ones
that work for me really really good pill
so just take one of those like 20
minutes before you get on a plane or a
boat or whatever I've got my soap &amp;amp;
Glory handset
and once I get styler and this will go
into my kind of beach bag or wherever
I'm going because always good to have
hand sanitizer with you I've also got
some tissues just in case any tissues
and then let me go through the routine
quickly so once I'm on the plane I'm
gonna take my makeup off and I have my
mini incy wincy by derma to do that and
some cotton wool so I'll take all my
makeup off because I don't want to be
sitting there for 13 hours with a
learner makeup on
once I've kind of cleansed my skin I'm
gonna apply a lot of eye cream because
my skin is dehydrated anyway and on a
plane it gets so dehydrated so this is
just my lyric D up to calm I cream and
this is the one I'm gonna be using on
holiday as well a lot of these things
I'll move into my normal meet Beauty bag
once I get there so lots of eye cream
and then I will also be putting on my
origins overnight drink up mask which
will be in here I'm gonna put it in here
last minute just before I leave and this
is really good because you can just
leave it on for the whole flight in it
just soak into your skin you can reapply
it if you need to and it's clear so it
won't look completely crazy I'm going to
leave my eye makeup on but just take
everything on my face off and put on a
mask which will be really nice I think
and afterwards if I need more
moisturizer or anything like that I've
got high gel Iran which is a really good
moisturizer with a hyaluronic acid and
just I'm taking like all my really
really moisturizing products for the
plane I've also got a
chordally ET elixir and I've put it in
this little and this one's called flow
it's kind of about travel oh I lost my
travel oh and then when I went to try
and buy a new one I couldn't find one
anywhere so I just bought this one which
is called flow I got it from Boots and I
put my Cordelia feet elixir in there so
I can use it on the plane and when I'm
on holiday I also have my Palma divine
so I can use that on my lips so my lips
are hydrated throughout the whole flight
and I had my hand cream my Kiehl's hand
cream which I love and I put hand cream
on loads during the flights because I
hands get really dry and then if when I
kind of land I've taken my mask off and
cleanse my face
I still have kind of mascara on but if I
feel like I need to have got
cela and a clinic cream blush but I
probably won't I'm going to Thailand so
we're gonna land at night so I really
don't think I'm gonna care how I look
like but just in case and I've got a
little mirror so that's everything from
my in-flight bag and yeah it probably
seems about over the top but like I said
it's something to do to distract me from
being on a plane so I'm happy and yeah
definitely going to do that so quickly
before I show you my makeup bag I just
wanted to show you I've made myself like
a emergency first aid kit and I'm really
proud of it so I wanted to show you guys
I just bought this little zip bag from
Phoenix they do really good zip bags
just a smaller one and this is kind of
everything you need for an emergency in
the holiday well kind of everything you
need and I'm just going to keep this now
every time I go away obviously if you're
going somewhere like in Europe or
America you can buy things anywhere but
thailand's a little bit harder to get
hold of stuff so it's quite important to
take these sort of essentials and I just
have to handy wipes and just in case I
have sava on healing gel I have
imodium lovely here definitely an
essential though when you're in my life
Thailand and I have wound cleaning wipes
and just three of those just in case
near a fan like new friend bite in
sting relief I have all the kind of bite
prevention stuff whatever it's called in
my other bag which I'll show in the next
video and so that's just hydrocortisone
for bites and then my pen knife which I
got from my 16th birthday I think and
this is like one of the best presents
you can get if your bride present for
someone who's like 16 17 this is really
good it will last them forever I took it
on my gap here you definitely need it
even if it's just for like opening
coconuts I use this a lot when I was
Thailand in my gap year so that's
everything from that bag but now onto my
makeup bag and I have it in this bag I
have both fancy makeup bags in the past
and I thought those roll-up things you
hand on the door but these are my
favorite kind of bags because they're
clear and you can see everything that's
inside really compact
big just love it I got this from Phoenix
as well Phoenix do everything I think is
fair
mr. Lewis Oh actually I think it's John
Louis this and this in my local shopping
center John Lewis is one end and
finished as the other one I always get
them mixed up actually think it's a
journalist and anyway so I'm going to
show you what's in here and I'm just
gonna grab what I see is there's no kind
of particular order
my unique high-impact mascara which is
my favorite mascara at the moment I
don't really think I have any waterproof
mascara so I haven't quite decided if I
need one or not I'm not
I might take I might buy a cheap
drugstore one and take water before in a
case this is my favorite mascara at the
moment so I'm gonna take that my Clarins
instant like natural lip Perfector and
this is in 0-2 which is like the peachy
shade and Marina's now I love this it's
really nice when you're in like a hot to
climb it because it just looks really
nice and summery my Mac two eyeshadows
patina and charcoal Brown that's kind of
all I need for I shadow really I'm
wearing that today and I just love the
combo for a nice smoky eye I always have
one more eye product which is my
Maybelline the color stay tattoo
whatever it's called in on and on bronze
and because I wanted to say cream
eyeshadow it's good for doing the day
isn't I probably won't wear eyeshadow
during the day it's just good even in
the evening when you're in like a hot
climate and my eyeshadow primer for when
I'm wearing the powder eyeshadows
because specially when it's hot you need
a primer my Anastasia clear brow gel and
although this isn't my favorite it's
good because it's really strong and
makes my eyebrows stay in place which is
important on holiday because they tend
to go all over the place and so yeah
taking that one I've got my Mac syrup
lipstick which is nearly gone so because
in hot climates my lipsticks tense and
melts it wouldn't be the end of the
world because I've nearly finished
anyway and it's my favorite kind of
everyday lipstick so I know I'll get a
lot of use out of it and I'm also going
to take lip butter Revlon lip butter and
berry smoothie which is a nice everyday
summery kind of pinky berry shade for
bronzer I'm going to take my jewelry
bronzer because I finished my NARS on
but also this is nice and small and
compact and hydrating so that's a really
nice bronze let's go
as well first aid beauty daily face
cream because it's nice and small and I
don't take my big origins pots but I
really like this moisturizer anyway also
I'm not sure why this is in here but
this is something for my face I've got
to set for one-four face and body and
this is the rush pose a Sun cream in 30
SPF 30 and then I have a few face
products because I don't really know
what color my skin is gonna be at the
moment it's very pale so it's quite
likely I'll get a bit of a tan and then
I'll change colors so I described a few
things but everything's kind of small so
it's alright this one is if I do get
quite and it'd be nice to use just on
its own which is the this works perfect
look skin miracle which is just kind of
a bronzey liquid and then I have my mini
sample of my favourite dr. jart BB cream
which is the premium one I love this
mini sample it's so good having you said
yeah I've been saving it for holiday and
then I have my Bobbi Brown BB cream
which it's in fair so this is probably
what I use at the beginning of the
holiday when I'm still this color and a
mini mini shoe a skint in that what I
was calling moisture tint luminizing
moisture tint in golden so this is a bit
more Brown so I can use this if I get
tan but it's so tiny hardly takes up any
space so it doesn't really matter if I
don't get any use out of it I have two
bronzers a powder one for like evenings
or because I'm taking a cream one but I
don't love cream blushes so if I decided
I really can't be bothered with a cream
blush it's quite a nice to have and this
is a Bobbi Brown one in pink rose and
I'm 42 and it's so tiny and flat it's
good for traveling and then the cream
blusher I'm taking which I talked about
in my blog already is the Kevyn Aucoin
tres Belle and it looks like it's just
really really nice like dark pink
for concealer my usual favourites Bobbi
Brown corrector and light bisque and
origins plant scription
concealer for highlighter I'm taking my
all-time favorite which is the gemma
kids
juhi glow all over radiance creme in
rose gold I'm so worried I'm going to
finish this because I think this
discontinued but it's my favorite cream
highlighter
one eyeliner my favorite Brown makeup
forever I
in 2l and Bobby Brown sharpener go with
it and then the final thing oh yeah I
forgot about this this is a little
sample pot all kind of going everywhere
of the Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer
which is a really dark color comment
what color I got it might just be best
but it's too dark for me now but I
remember in the summer it was perfect
for me so I'm taking a little bit that
just in case I need it I'm and then
brushes I put them in this which is also
from John Lewis this was in the sale and
the reason I like it is because the zip
goes all the way to the side so when you
open it it opens really wide I was
looking everywhere for brushroll and
couldn't find one I like they were all
quite bulky so this turned out to be a
perfect thing for my brushes I have my
Real Techniques blush brush which I use
for bronzer I have two Real Techniques
stippling brushes one is for my base and
like tinted moisturizer or foundation or
whatever and this and one is for a cream
butter you can tell the difference
between my old one and my new one it's
actually quite gross my Gemma kid
concealer brush at my Mac two to four
with a breath of concealer and then the
rest all have travel sized brushes and
this is a Mac kind of mini two one seven
and these both Estee Lauder many kind of
blending brushes this is a Becca blush
brush which is the softest brush ever
and this is like a japanesse Kea
eight-30 so that's for like under eye
eye shadow so mainly travel sized
brushes but these real technique ones
that on any travel sizes that are as
good so I'm just going to take the big
ones and that's everything I feel like I
really wish to that but I'm also
thinking that this video has been really
long so well done if you lost it true
that but I thought you might like to be
a little nosy even have a look at what
I'm taking with me so I'm going away
tomorrow so nervous about the flight but
um there should be another video up on
Sunday which would be like a little vlog
of me finishing up my packing and stuff
like that so as I said before my blog
will still have posts up daily so don't
forget to check that out which is what I
heart today calm and thank you for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
