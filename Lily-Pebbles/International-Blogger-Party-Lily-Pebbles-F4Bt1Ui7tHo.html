New York
let me move out this terribly
unflattering light
this looks pretty well actually I woke
up about five from the jet LAG's but I
managed to go back to sleep after like
doing a little bit of chatting and
what's happened stuff I went back to
sleep and now I felt fine I need to get
ready
I look around I'm just having breakfast
I got some orange juice and panna
shockula and I'm watching Ana's new
video and we've got three mornings so I
think we're gonna do a bit of shopping
and exploring this morning before the
first part of the launch this afternoon
it's raining today so I thought I would
tie my hair up just to avoid any crazy
frizzy hair dramas I'll quickly show you
what I'm wearing today this is from
Topshop mmm yeah this is from Topshop
because it's quite chilly outside you're
like wear this festive underneath and
they're my crazy Topshop jeans with the
silver and I'm gonna wear white trainers
I'm ain't gonna get destroyed I just
have to put the minashi machine when I
get home I'm gonna take my saline bag
out with me today because it fits quite
a lot in there
and I'm gonna take with me this camera
I'm filming on my phone my purse my
portable phone charger and lead snack
because jet lag makes me weird a little
mirror this is pretty cute actually
umbrella because it's raining Charlotte
Tilbury very Victoria lipstick you can
see that because I gots you spot my chin
that keeps making an appearance and then
in a separate bag I'm gonna take my fake
camera and my polaroid as well I've been
trying to take some Polaroids and this
trip so this one is of my windowsill
this one's of me and Amelia I do love a
good Polaroids but here's the test does
the umbrella fit in this magic bag at
fit yes oh my god everything fits in
this bag is amazing
I only bought one perfume with me on
this trip and I thought it was fitting
that I bought the one I bought in
Sephora last time I was here so this is
the was the brand hood again Elizabeth
and James it's Mary Kay Ashley's brand
navarre no white and I don't wear that
that much at home but I really like it
so I thought they'd bring on this trip
I'll wear it okay I think I'm ready to
go I'm basically meeting someone in the
lobby who's very kindly gifting me one
of their amazing
my bags they got in touch saying would
you like to travel about camera bags and
I was like what I'm actually in New York
next week because it's a new york-based
company so he's gonna come and meet me
show me one of his bags I hope I can use
it while I'm on this trip instead of
trying to like hold my SLR camera on my
shoulder to just get wet in the rain so
I'm gonna go meet him and then I think
meet up with Melia and everyone else
we're gonna head out and do some
shopping oh my god guys I just went to
met him this hey the Browns called
owner or Bo na
I reckon its owner so many of you
recommended this brand because I've been
looking for a camera bag for ages so I
was so happy when they got in touch they
do actually ship internationally so you
can't get it in the UK but the
convenience of me being in New Yorkers
and say then it's so hard to find a good
camera buy especially in the UK I find
it really hard you need something that's
actually sturdy and like meant for
cameras but it looks stylish as well the
camera bag I have on my Amazon is so
ugly seriously let me show you this bag
I put the link to this specific bag
under the video and I'm hoping edits and
photos and stuff with it today for the
blog so it looks like this it's leather
and it's beautiful and it's black with
gold hardware opens up and it's like a
proper let me take the strap out what
for like sturdy padded bag it's got two
sections so I can fit like SLR and a
lens in there or my Polaroid camera and
it doesn't feel heavy either I'm gonna
load it now and try it on so I put in
camera and the paranoid into as you
could probably use this just as your
main bag and put your camera one side
and then let your purse your phone
everything else on the other mm maybe I
should do that so you can either wear it
on one shoulder or you can wear it
crossbody which is probably what I would
do it's quite large it's a it's like
medium to large size so comfortable
though oh my god this is literally
life-changing it means I can actually
take my camera around me and take photos
I love it yeah I think I'm just gonna
take this bag so I put in everything my
umbrella my sunglasses my other camera
all I'm holding that my charger
everything on one side and a camera on
the other this is so hard I can't get
over it I'm in the lobby now and I'm
here with Amelia and we're just waiting
for Lydia and then Austria gonna head
out
so I will introduce you to the gang as
they kind of come into the videos
there's me Amelia Lydia ko shell and
Leanne and grace from glamour so it's
really nice little group
Lydia's here now
I'm gonna link everyone's channels below
who I'm here on the trip and by the way
so I think now we're going to get a cab
- I'll go tea I'm so excited at the
place where I got team chinos and the
tea last days last I was here so yeah I
need a bit of caffeine
I know exactly me I'm so excited my tea
party no I don't get introduced these
two who have logging away I'm gonna go
for the chocolate mint tea Pacino's I
got chocolate a min and I just had a
little sip it's very hot but it's so
good just as good as I remembered I want
to have one a day while I'm here so I
really enjoy it
I wish they'd bring it to the UK it just
pops back it's a sport to see if they
have lipstick they're like sold out
everywhere this one does even stop them
but there's a maid well next door I
really love Madewell so we're gonna pop
in there and I need to get in this
rocking mood always I'm just gonna miss
all my opportunities I might try stuff
on melius taking us the dough guilty of
our plane and there's so many cool
flavors we're now in Soho which i think
is probably my favourite area in New
York
luckily it's kind of stopped raining
we're gonna go fight my tea for lunch
maybe but just daughter quite people
recommended that and also get some
photos for our blogs and stuff you just
stop to take some outfit so it says I
think we've all learned that Lydia is an
absolute outfit photo-taking pro I hate
posing and I can't do it for more than
two minutes that I'm just getting bored
Emilia is pretty pro tea I think we're
gonna head and have some lunch now all a
bit hungry and then we've gotta go right
to hotel to get ready for tonight look
at these two
so I got a red lentil and wild rice bowl
need to pop into a CVS on the way back
look at my nails we're going to like big
beauty party tonight and I look like the
worst beauty vlogger ever Wow we just
had to really really rush back to the
hotel you're running so so late it's
just we stay in Central Park but we were
hanging out and Soho they're so far from
each other and we've got to be in the
lobby in five minutes so I came back
quickly touched up my makeup and changed
my outfit how could he show you guys
what I'm wearing before I have to head
downstairs always I think they're going
to murder me I'm wearing my Topshop
culottes with my Topshop boots they
don't really go but that's all I have
leather jacket and the top I got from I
think it's my whistles actually got a
little cut out the shoulder this bag is
from Strawberry let me show you this bag
cuz it's super cute it's a tiny mini
version of my other bag it's kind of
cream with gold hardware which I really
like and a chain strap with a bit of
leather it's so so cute it's small but
big enough to fit in like camera phone
whatever you need really really really
like this I'll show you guys it properly
soon
camera crews bring a diffuser bowl but
we're gonna go in get dry
we want to thank you guys for coming in
our 20 year history we have never had
such a big launch we're launching
obviously a hundred lipstick rubies here
to help us do it which is amazing can
you guys give it up

somewhere

got a practical to go back I'm gonna go
to bed and edit my video say night to
these guys also like tired again okay
see nice that little move there
I've just got to the end of that clip
but and realize I haven't finished my
vlog so I'm lying in bed doing this
because we've got a really early shoot
tomorrow
I also realized that in this video I
feel like I haven't really explained
what I'm doing here because I didn't
really know myself I knew that was
coming out with the urban decay but we
had no idea what the launch was until
like today really so they're launching a
hundred new lipsticks I think there's
like four different formulas I'm gonna
do like a blog post when I get home
because I haven't even really been able
to try them properly yet but I know
there's loads of colors and tomorrow
we're doing a photo shoot for a lookbook
so we've all been given a different
lipstick color and we're gonna do some
like Posey photos but we have to be down
in the lobby at 7 like ready at 7
oh that like hurts my head even thinking
about it I am so tired falling asleep
and to see in this video but daily
videos and being five hours behind means
I've got to get these vlogs done before
bed so I hope you guys enjoyed the first
kind of top in New York vlog everyone's
heading home tomorrow but I'm staying
here for a couple more days to see Kisha

really excited too so there'll be a
couple more New York vlogs thank you
