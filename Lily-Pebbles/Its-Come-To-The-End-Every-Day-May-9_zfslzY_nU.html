I'm off to Anna's it's but John it's
quarter past eleven I've gotta get going

to film a beauty tap video and we're
gonna have some little brainstorming
sessions we got some work to do and yeah

ready now and then head out oh and I
just said I've message to say should I
bring in food as she says she's made
lunch that's really nice so I'm gonna
leave now I think if I remember
correctly my car has no petrol I don't
know about you guys but I hate putting
petrol in the car I feel like the hand
was a maid like in America they do it
for you but in the UK you do it yourself
and they fill out the handles are made
for like man's hands they're huge
and it really hurts but I know we made
rich - I'm just gonna man up and do it
today but like an hour to drive maybe 45
minutes we're gonna yeah 15 miles left
better go get some petrol stations and
make me want to get crisps you know what
it is that I just had I don't you crisps
any other time seriously I'm in traffic
but so good so then listening to ear
biscuit podcasts rumors because this is
great Kim go to be at Anna's in like two
minutes and I'm kind of sad if I'm
honest looking forward to seeing her but
sad that I haven't finished this podcast
yet I'm gonna have to wait good journey
hi Emma Anna's and I literally sat down
and we haven't stopped talking for about
25 minutes like even breathe but I think
we can have some lunch anymore
yeah Anna's made Wharf Hodge tire oh my
god this looks so good let's not tell
the people on the floor its secret what
smells really nice and like peanutty
cashew butter but cuz you have a
spiralizer okay I didn't fart like this
I did it with a peeler unseeingly
you can use your spiralizer this looks
so good
thank you it's delicious
we've moved on to ice cream we're both
cravings like sweet this is like dairy
free ice cream so it's like kind of
healthy ish really class
this is what Ana has today when she
films a video she's getting all of these
out of her cupboard tripod and three
lights one two they all live in here hey
this comments robot okay lights and
camera setup Ana's changed her top
special occasion really workout leggings

ten this month yeah when it crazy this
house this is 12 there was really good
ones if this is the throwback pizza
chair when's it going up do you know I
warned them it might be a while three
weeks time you have to wait a little bit
but I think it's gonna be a good one so
at least you've seen like a little
behind the scenes now that you wanting
to focus on me yeah this is my posing
for a focus face okay just finished that
was I know we always say this but that
was the most giggly one yet there were
diary entries photos hilarious stories
of Ana as a very strange child I'm gonna
tear up this diary entry so that no one
else can ever be and I know just talking
about it's really hard to remember how
to spell the words stationary like
stationary with an e stationary with an
A I was like I just don't know how to
remember the difference and we just
thought I was actually think when you're
standing still like stationary and I
said you're not on e like we're party I
mean you're moving stand still I'm not
on E
alright son two flags I'm gonna go walk
to Ana's local shop and get myself some
kind of sweet treat I couldn't decide
what to get so I went for Terry's
chocolate orange and for our Roche and a
Ribena
it's nearly that time for me so I feel
like if there's ever and it's nice to
eat chocolate it's nice now I'm gonna
head home now I haven't really blogged
much today but we've been very
productive
indeed helped me see nice to see you oh
I'm gonna drive home and carry on
listening to my podcast I didn't finish
on the way head back in the car another
our doctor
right I'm home now and I was listening
to the Elle and Blair podcast on the way
home which is a hilarious salon it's
really different to the others they're
kind of crazy but it was it was really
interesting and my mom is making a
delicious salad which is nice
mmm like mango e and stuff it's very
good I'm gonna go and sit down and I
forgotten what I was gonna do oh yeah me
and my sisters are trying to plan a nice
lunch my parents anniversary their 40th
wedding anniversary which is crazy is
your fourth year wow that has mad some
of my friends parents are 44 buds eggs
so we're trying to find somewhere nice
to go for lunch actually maybe you guys
can help we want to go somewhere that's
like just outside of London not to Fox
we're taking like the kids with us it's
like nice okay it's gonna be in July so
hopefully the weather will be nice and
like countryside somewhere we can have a
really nice lunch and then let go for
walks and explore the area so if you
guys know anywhere we try to get a table
at Petersham nurseries but they were
booked up so we're on the lookout for
somewhere else and that's what I'm gonna
do now a bit of research and I'm gonna
watch a bit of a bit of Britain's Got
Talent from last night and being a
really good girlfriend and going to pick
up rich from his work he's like working
out with our friend Rob and I think they
do like him outside
outdoor gym and worked out he likes to
like use his own body weight to work out
rather than like being stuffed in a gym
with no windows which I completely get
and I said I'd go
but it'll be nice when I see my friends
for a while so we're gonna go have a
little cup of tea and a catch-up which
probably won't vlog feel like I haven't
really loved that much today but I
haven't really done much me and Anna had
a lot of work to go home with this is my
last everyday main blog so sad I don't

thank you so much thanks will feedback
yesterday as well when I was asking
about new videos that you guys want I'm
a lot of you asking for more vlogs

consideration it's quite funny some
people like hilarious via opinionated
there were quite a few comments they
were like no this is a beauty channel so
you should have more beauty videos just
so you guys over this is not a beauty
channel this is the Lily pebbles channel
which just means that anything that I
want to put on the channel goes on the
channel pretty much it's just me and I'm
sure as I grow up the content will
content don't mean that yeah like the
stuff I film will change so it's
definitely not just about beauty that it
just so happens the what I'm into at the
moment anywho I'm gonna do my skincare
routine now take off my makeup which is
my favorite time of day highlight of the
day today didn't do anything that
exciting to say it was obviously really
nice to see Anna who is nice to see Anna
