met some of the guys that work in the
head office and they're actually the
seventh generation that's how like it's
a family business if you go forever no
they said seventh generation we learnt
all about the history of perfume right
through every different scent and picked
my favorites and ended up with my
perfect perfume which we named pebbles
of cause Purple's white lily pebbles it
was really really nice you enjoy it yeah
I kind of really interesting that's
really interesting and when we when I
get home I'll show you the fragrance and
like notes that went inside

normally get people liking this sort of
sense but I always like the person like
that your hands to keep it aside fit
yeah just leaving anthropology wants you
to come in and get my mom a little
present we try to start this new
tradition I did it last year where I buy
her a present on my birthday Emma call
it a fair president instead of a
birthday present because she's alone the
little hard work I feel so guilty I get

sign on it now we're heading to no key
for lunch and I love it here which has
never been so

to the loo first because it's a crazy
new with mirrors everywhere you kind of
get lost and you don't really know how
to out
sorry st. out and surely didn't know

Christmas decorations that it's all lit
up and everything
London parking prices Wow so I'm back

grandma's house because she wanted to
see me open my birthday present which
was a very sweet she gave me like a
really meaningful like something that
belonged to her that I will keep forever
that you loved it it was really nice and
then we hung out for a little bit and
then we went via dirty burger on the way
home because I just thought I want to
come home have a nice bath and get into
my new pajamas and then what I really
want for dinner is a burger so we went
to the dirty burger it's actually called
dirty burger and they do the best burger
and chips so that's what I'm gonna have

that this is mine and my mom's jaw of

like a toilet in my vlog they are just
the comfiest things ever I absolutely
love them oh my god best birthday
present ever

clothes here in there it's so funny the
theme is so obvious all my friends said

much thought and I literally loved every
single present I got this year feeling
