guys about my favorite things from the
past month and I have a list here in
front of me of eleven things and only
one of them is beauty so there's a big
mix today like kick fashion lifestyle
lots of things to chat about before I
get started I keep getting messages from
people saying that they've been
unsubscribe to my channel which is just
so sad so please check them still
subscribe if you want to turn on
notifications which is like the little
Bell sign it means you get a notified
every time I upload a video I don't mind
if you don't but I just wanted to say in
case my videos aren't making it to your
subscription boxes okay let's get
started this is my first favorite this
is a book called humans of New York
stories before I called Brandon Stanton
and you may have heard of him because
humans of New York I'm pretty sure to
start on Facebook I think this guy
Brandon be a photographer for a very
long time and over around five six years
he went around New York taking photos of
strangers and asking them questions
learning about them in hearing their
stories and I think eventually he
decided stopping them on Facebook
and humans of New York became this
Facebook page and became really popular
I've always loved humans of New York on
Facebook because it just pops up and you
get to hear someone's amazing story and
see a beautiful portrait photo of them I
just love the idea of it and it's so
initially pleasing and really
interesting as I learn about all
different kinds of people so we've
turned all these stories or maybe just
some of them into this book and I
thought this for Christmas so as you can
see is loads of pictures of all
different people photography is
beautiful stories are just fascinating
so where they were just short quote some
of them are a bit longer he's just
taking snippets from all the stories
that he's collected I think it's so so
interesting and such a good book to have
on your coffee table as well because you
can kind of get in and out of it
next up are some coasters from
anthropology anthropology is just one of
my favorite shops it has been since it
opened
I always remember going whenever I went
to America with my mom we'd always go to
anthropology to have a look so the first
one of these I actually bought four of
these I bought two in this color and two
in this color and I just think they are
gorgeous they've had these for a really
long time rich got them for me
Christmas and I think they're so pretty
I actually love so I think this one is
my favorite color and then for my office
I just bought one of these actually
wanted more but they sold out there was
only one left it's got a beautiful gold
around the edge and then it's like the
pink stone bit like rose quartz and it's
all like different edges as you don't
love how that edges really straight I
love the kind of jagged edge and it
looks really pretty on my desk and I
love it
next up is an app if you guys watch my
hello 2017 video it was a very funny
block from my Newsies party that I
hosted was friends we actually did
karaoke and a lot of people asked how we
did it and me rich looked into renting a
karaoke machine and it was so expensive
luckily because my dad is like a masters
muse oh he has loads of microphones at
home so what we actually ended up doing
is using his microphones and AM but we
downloaded the lucky voice at and lucky
voice is a chain of karaoke bars in the
UK but they've now created an app where
you subscribe like weekly or monthly you
can cancel at any time so I just did
like a one week subscription it was like
one pound fifty and then you just get it
up on your iPad or something and sync it
with the TV lucky voice literally has
every song ever and it's so good and it
just worked perfectly it was so cheap
you didn't have to rent and carry the
machine and I thought it was genius I
feel like my favourites as months of so
random but this is my next favorite as
you guys know I have an iPad pro I love
it and I love using that Apple pencil
but as soon as I thought it I thought
how am I not going to lose this pencil
it's like 80 pounds I know you can get
pen holders for your iPad case but
they'll just seemed a bit like not
convenient for me and you know I went to
see a store to get something else and I
saw this it's on the brand's Belkin but
they sell it in the Apple store and it's
an Apple pencil holder so that just sits
on my desk I think they've got nicer
colors but they only had silver when I
went and as you can see the little hole
in there and you just pop your pencil in
there and now it just fits on my desk
and I know I'm never going to lose it I
had only old home and I loved it so if
you have an Apple pencil I would really
recommend this okay this is my duty
favorite it's from LA roche-posay it's a
new product for them and pretty sure I
think it came out
this month it's their waterproof eye
makeup remover I've used more than half
the bottle now and this is great it's
very similar to the Clarins one which
I've always said is my like all-time
favorite one assailant is just as good
they're pretty much equal I actually
haven't compared the price I'm assuming
this one is more affordable than
Clarence I really like it it's one of
those like split buyers phase or
whatever they're called you shape up and
put it on cotton wool and just gets rid
of all my eye makeup including
waterproof mascara and I think it's
really nice product okay I have another
app recommendation this one is for more
like photography stuff it's Snapseed and
I know I'm really late to the game
Snapseed has been around for ages but I
really like it for editing my photos so
I just use vsco cam to just edit the
size of my photo like crop it and I use
facetune when I'm whitening something
but I've been using Snapseed to change
the brightness of a photo to change the
warmth of the photo highlights contrast
it's really easy to use you just kind of
swipe on the image to change the
settings and I just really like it I've
used quite a few different editing apps
and some of them are just too
complicated for their own good I know
what my Instagram post is to be overly
edited so I've really been enjoying
using snap feed okay I feel like now is
a good time to talk about my TV
favorites because I have three first one
was accidental I didn't really mean to
get into it which watch is quite
actually programs without me and he was
watching suits and I think he got a
couple of seasons in actually and it was
just as if he was watching it was always
cooking dinner
I kept kind of half watching it and then
eventually I'd have got sucked in and
became obsessed I did those six seasons
of suits so far and the best way to
describe it is it's kind of like Grey's
Anatomy but for lawyers it's very easy
to what it's very like addictive
we fall in love with all the characters
individually and it's basically about a
guy who pretends he's a qualified lawyer
he's brilliant lawyer but yet he didn't
really get qualification so it's all
about that and it's so great I really
can't wait for the second half of season
6 because I really enjoyed it
it's rich just loves the fact that I got
into it he was like I told you like it
and once we finished suits we started
this is us which I think I watched on
the sky
we've been recommended it by so many
friends and by things that everyone says
you have to watch it I was like ok ok I
will I didn't even really know what it
was about
it's so good this is asked is about a
family I don't know how much I can say
without giving it away actually but the
way it's filled with brake lever it
switches between past and present and I
love that kind of style of storytelling
a lot of the show is based in 70s which
is just I love that kind of time so
loads of cool fashion and styling it's
just a real like feel-good series really
easy to watch really quick so definitely
recommend that also it's really funny as
well then the next one is does is what
she was the Oh a another one that's like
being really hyped up and this one I
think really divides opinions so many
people said that they thought was really
weird and they can get into it and
Leslie was have been loved it I did the
key with the OE I personally loved it
but you have to get past the first
episode at least because the first
episode is completely different to the
whole rest of the series for season
I never does it series or seasons you
have to get past the first episode and
there were times it's a bit weird but
just don't give up because I think I
really loved it a bit weird it's a bit
like science ii sci-fi it's about a girl
who goes missing and she gets involved
with like a science experiment I think I
can say that without giving too much
away the guy who plays the main
character is brilliant and so pretty and
you kind of just she says fascinating I
really really liked it I'm really sad as
over okay let's move on to the next
favorite this is my Q key k meal planner
and I talk about this a lot and snapchat
and I get so many messages from people
saying where's it from
either they haven't heard me say it on
the snap or the original snap gets
deleted after 24 hours and then I feel
like I can never tell before it's prom
so I thought I'd put in a video this is
what rich and I used to plan our meals
we are always doable example last three
weeks and we try because it's the
easiest way to do three shots we'll sit
down unlike us
Sunday night and plan out what we're
going to have for dinners we kind of
work around dinner and I'll eat for
lunch what's left over from dinner so it
has the days of the week and then it has
breakfast lunch dinner snack and it's
Magnificat well so it sticks on the
fridge which is so handy and then when
you're done with that we just rip it off
and start a new week qqk is a really
cool station shop in Covent Garden I
love their stationery they do so many
cool things like this meal planner and
lots of like organizational stationery
so definitely check out qk if you
haven't already the next favorite again
is something i get so many questions
about on snapchat and it is hoodie
it's a massive oversized hoodie it's
from ASOS white
everything's oversized the absolutely
itself it's like really stake to put a
huge hood sort of huge like white
ribbons I just think it's so cool I
really I wear it at home most of time
just because it's so comfortable and it
really keeps me warm the UK is so cold
at the moment so I love it it comes in
and out of stock I've seen it be
restocked a few times so I will link to
it below if it's out of stock at the
moment just keep an eye on it because
sometimes it comes back in I'll try and
let you know on Twitter or snapchat if I
see it come back in stock I will let you
guys know or I try to but it's so cozy I
love it and I love the blush color of it
I wear that all the time
I'm just waiting because there's a
little girl out there who is bawling her
eyes out because her dad wants her to
wear a coat and she doesn't want to wear
a coat and she's screaming so I'm just
waiting for the screaming I feel like
that was a really quick favorites for
those random things you guys probably
don't even really care about but those
are honestly the things I've been loving
over the past month I've been using a
lot of the same if you just self
actually over the past week I've been
trying quite a lot of new things so
maybe in my next monthly favorites
that'd be more beauty but for now that's
the stuff I've been loving if you want
to watch my last video I will link it
here along with the subscribe button if
you want to subscribe to my channel and
a recent blog post too if you'd like to
check it out I'll be back on Wednesday
evening with a vlog hopefully so I'll
