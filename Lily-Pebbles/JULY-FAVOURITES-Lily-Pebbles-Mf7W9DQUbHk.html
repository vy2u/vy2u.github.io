today I'm going to be talking through my
July favorites this month is just flying
by I can't believe how quickly it's
going I think it's because I've been
away quite a lot I went to New York with
West Elm you would have seen the vlog
and then I also entered France with lots
of times I've been traveling a lot this
month but I still have like a massive
list of favorites so I'm quite excited
to film this video and talk to all my
favorite things from this month I've got
quite a lot of beauty things and then
one style a couple of style things and
also a techy favorite as well
I've just like left my hair straight
today because I really can't be able to
curl it so I hope it looks alright let
me get started and just grab some of the
things a city makes me here on the bed
so the first thing I want to mention are
the new real technique powder blue
brushes I open these on a vlog so you
would have seen them already by falling
in love with them I think they're really
really great there's quite a few brushes
in the range maybe like 6 but my
favorites are b01 which like a big
powder brush you can use for powder or
bronzer and then b02 which is perfect
for this is a really like multi-use
brush because you can use it for powders
like setting under the eyes you can use
it for contour I use it for blush it's
not too small for blush bronzer there's
quite a few things you can use this for
and they're so incredibly soft it's just
unreal and then my third favorite is b04
which is like the little powder brush
you could also use this for setting
powder but it's just a really great
eyeshadow blush as well I need to use it
for concealer they're all really like
multi-purpose but so incredibly soft
they feel so high-end and I don't think
they get more expensive than 22 pounds
which I guess for like boots is quite
expensive but compared to like high-end
brushes not at all and they're such
amazing quality
I showed this in my Sephora haul when I
came back from New York it's the Urban
Decay Naked heat palette there has been
so much hype around this palette and I
think it's well deserved
I really really like it I'm wearing it
today I'm actually wearing one of the
lighter shades and wine sauce which is
like this third one in and it looks so
warm on the lids it's just a beautiful
collection of very warm eyes shadows I
love all of these shades so much the
quality is amazing like all over 2k
shadows and I just find myself using
this a lot so I think it's going to be a
really good one to have in my collection
definitely worth picking up if you
haven't gone bald at any other naked
palettes I think first one was good at
the time but now
I think out of all of them this one's
definitely my favorite I've been so
impressed that Brian called Beauty pie
now it's a bit of a weird system I don't
fully understand how it works but I'm
pretty sure you pay like a monthly fee
for the privilege of being able to buy
the products from their side which
sounds crazy but then the products
themselves are really really affordable
and amazing quality they're basically
like cost price they don't charge any
extra for like marketing or packaging or
anything like that pretty sure that's
how it works
I've actually never shopped on beauty
pie before it's definitely something to
bear in mind I've been sent products
from them and I've been really impressed
I really like the concealer and then
I've got two products in this favorites
video so I definitely think the products
are great but I can't recommend the kind
of shopping customer service side of
things this is the fruit enzyme
five-minute facial and this is so great
it says it's super smoothing purifying
and resurfacing so I'm going to like
enzyme foliate is so you kind of applied
in a skin and rub in circular motions
all over your face leave it on for 5
minutes and then when you wash it off
with a muslin cloth my skin is just left
so glowy it's such a light on to use you
can use this in the morning doesn't my
skin a little bit red but then it kind
of dies down or you can use it in the
evening but it really really works I can
really see a difference after I use this
and I'm very impressed with it was it
her Beauty pie now I only got this
yesterday so it's very premature to pin
it my favorites video I didn't want to
wait till next month because I really
think I like it and wearing this today
it is the quick color contoured super
gel I've never seen anything like it
this is in like a little tube and then
when you open up it's got a sponge
applicator on the end and the product
that comes out looks really really dark
brown but it's a really light gel so if
you use like a beauty blender or a
contour brush just blend it in you're
left with this really soft gentle kind
of bronze contour I'm wearing it today
and with no other bronze on top I mean I
am right next to a bright window but it
definitely added a bit of definition it
feels really soft and smoothing on the
skin and it's in such cool little
packaging I just think it's some really
unique products and I've only use it
twice but I think I'm in love okay a few
more Beauty favorites and I won't talk
too much about this because I feel like
I've gone on and on and on about it but
it's a glossy a milky journey cleanser I
just had to put this and I talked about
it in my skincare video if you haven't
seen it I will link it above I just
think it's really great
I love the kind of soft Rose scent it
has to it and I think I've used about
this much so far so definitely worked my
way through this also mentioned in that
video is the dr. jart sera MIDI and
apparently you can now buy this in
Selfridges so you have to worry about it
only been available in Sephora I know
this is originally a Korean brand I
think but yeah you can get in Selfridges
and it's the most incredible moisturizer
I've ever used the last beauty favorites
is the glossy a coconut balm calm I
can't believe that I didn't like the
balm calm and I first tried it now I
just feel so differently about it I wear
this almost every day when I'm not
wearing a lipstick I'll just be wearing
this I have the plain lip balm as well
but I thought I'll just use this one out
first and it's got a really nice cooker
messy sentence not too sweet it's not
too much you can't like taste it when
you put on your lips it's just like a
nice subtle scent yeah I just think it's
so great it's like a slightly matte lip
balm it's so easy to wear it doesn't go
everywhere but it's like moisturizing
enough it's just perfect
my techie favorite you might see this on
my Instagram stories but I recently
purchased the Fujifilm XT - I got this
because my friend Carrie has it and she
let me have a little play highly
recommended it and I kind of fell in
love my friend Rheem also has it so I
ordered this on Amazon wasn't that cheap
this is like the new colorway and I kind
of prefer it with the silver and the
black weather than all black icing it
looks really cool and retro so I got the
body and then I always have got the 35
millimeter lens which is goes all the
way down to 1.4 I really like this
camera I'm not going to go too in depth
now but I really like it because all of
the settings are external so if you want
to change the s star or the ISO or the
shutter it's all kind of on the top with
like little knobs so you'd have to
fiddle about with a screen which I just
think makes it so quick and easy to use
also I really love that when you look in
the viewfinder it's like a digital
screen I don't really have to explain if
you're not just looking through a hole
it kind of shows you what the site is
going to look like which I just think is
genius very user friendly it looks
really cool it's very kind of it's not
crazy like but it's definitely lighter
than my big camera and it just kind of
made me enjoy taking photos again and
I'd really enjoyed using this it's got
Wi-Fi so I could take a photo and then
send it to my phone and use it on
Instagram which makes everything a lot
easier I really wanted a nice strap for
a like maybe like a change strap or
something because it's got these little
connectors between
you can kind of connect anything that
can clip on so if anyone knows of
anywhere where I can get a nice camera
strap not Etsy because I've already
looked there please let me know a minute
favorite is a necklace this is from Miss
Ouma I bought this with soma necklace
myself and then this one I got as a gift
at the gleam summer party it's got the
same chain as the one I'm wearing but
it's actually little snowflake necklace
it's really really pretty quite special
and unique and I actually like layering
them both up and I know it looks like
I'm wearing like quite a lot on my neck
but I quite like that look at the moment
also you can always kind of play around
and take this awesome for something else
on the chain I'm really into my soma at
the moment I want to get some more I
want to get one of those little ones I
know everyone kind of has the same
necklaces at the moment but I don't
really mind nothing they're really
pretty ok my final favorite you would
have seen it all over my Instagram this
is a dress from Topshop I'll insert
photo of me wearing it I only think I
was even that in love with it when I
bought it but I've got so much wear out
of this dress is such an easy summer
dress it's very light weighting
comfortable but I think it's really
flattering like the wrap style really
suits new because I've got bit of a
tummy it's kind of short which is good
for quite like my legs it's got a little
bit of sleeve which I quite like I just
think this is a really flattering dress
and I've worn it so so much do you guys
want to know what I'm wearing on my lips
it's the Clinique nude pop lipstick
which I've been wearing a lot recently
and those are all of my favourites I
feel like I went through those really
quickly I'm not going to lie I feel a
little bit lost as my youtube channel at
the moment I've got quite a big project
on and that's going on kind of behind
the scenes and it's going to take up a
lot of my time over the next few months
so it's been hard for me to kind of
haven't had any time to brainstorm video
ideas or spend any time making any kind
of cool creative videos so if you think
I'm acting a bit weird over the next few
months and like maybe if my videos are a
bit sporadic or if they're just not that
great in quality then please do excuse
me I am working on something and just
trying to figure out how to like
prioritize my time because I'm really
exciting things coming up so like
outside of work I've got my best friend
hen weekend and then her wedding and
then one of my other friends is having a
baby soon and then in September and mine
and Rich's first wedding anniversary and
I'm going to New York again in September
so it's quite a few exciting things
coming up which I'm looking forward to
and I see
that's about all I've got to update you
guys on I hope you enjoyed hearing about
all of my favorite products I really
love all of these things and I'm really
excited about Beauty again at the moment
