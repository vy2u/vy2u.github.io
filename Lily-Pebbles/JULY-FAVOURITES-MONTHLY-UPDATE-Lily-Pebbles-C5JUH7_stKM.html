gonna be my July favorites and monthly
update style of video I think I'm gonna
continue with what I did last month just
added loads of different categories to
make it a little bit more interesting
for you guys and I'm kind of trying to
do it mid month I think I'm a bit late
this month but I'm gonna go in it anyway
so let me start with my life update
since I lasted one of these videos I've
been to LA and France la was so much fun
me and Anna went out there for VidCon
but we went a week early so that we
could really enjoy LA and I've been to
LA a few times now and the first couple
of times I wasn't sure if I really loved
it but this time I feel like I really
fell in love with it we rented a car and
I absolutely loved driving like an
automatic Jeep it was so fun to have a
little mini road trip with Anna from LA
down to Anaheim we went to the Late Late
Show I did a whole vlog so I will link
the two videos I did in LA if you click
the I button you can go have a watch I
did a vlog and also did like a bit of a
fancy day out in LA video we stayed in
the Mondrian which is really cool this
the poor was a bit a bit too like simi
for me like people don't swim in that
pool they hang in that pool but it was a
really nice hotel in a really good
location in West Hollywood
I really enjoyed VidCon this year as
well I feel like for me and Anna our
audience isn't necessarily there because
it's quite young very kind of American
we do get to meet a few viewers but for
me going to VidCon is about meeting and
other content creators and it's so nice
to catch up with everyone I feel like
when I'm in London I kind of tend to
just see like the beauty youtubers but
I'd be can you get to meet all different
kinds of creators and it was so nice to
catch up with people like Will and Arden
who I really loved Steve Booker his
girlfriend Alexia wait they're married
now wife Alexia not girlfriend Claire
from hey Clare and Lana I'm gonna link
all of these peoples channels below
because it was just so nice to catch up
I always leave VidCon feeling quite
inspired France was really nice as well
that was more of a family holiday if you
follow me on snapchat I was doing a lot
of snapping so if you're not following
me there yet go and add me my usernames
just Lily pebbles because I kind of
snapped every day and I love
and I did a lot of snapchatting whilst I
was in France and I think you guys
really enjoyed it it did take some
photos for a blog post if that's not up
yet it will be coming up soon and I also
did it get ready with me with my mum
which I will link above
we had a friend's wedding while we were
out there so I filmed us getting ready
and the wedding was up in mujin and it
was so beautiful like in the hills such
a gorgeous setting before I end my
little life update section I just wanted
to say thanks for sticking with me I had
a bit of a weird blogger breakdown last
week I think it was a mix of just having
a lot on my plate I'm trying to plan
this bloody wedding whilst also having
lots of things going on behind the
scenes that you guys might not know
about that I'm just working on and it
all just got a bit too much I think it
was a bit of like PMS as well I don't
know I just felt more down last week
that I have in a very long time like in
years and I felt very confused about
what I am doing so I'm trying to kind of
get out of that mindset and I do feel
much better this week so thank you for
everyone who sent me really nice snaps
and tweets and stuff okay so now let's
talk about my favourite products from
the month and I think I have four things
the first one I mentioned in my what's
in my suitcase video that I filmed in LA
I will also link that video if you
haven't seen it it's by L'Oreal
professional and it's the mythic oil dry
conditioner so it's like a hair spray
but it's a conditioner I really like
this because a lot of products are like
creams or oils and if I put that on my
dry straight hair it would just make it
curly so this is a dry product that you
can spray on your hair when it's
straight and it's dry and it makes your
hair so soft and it adds so much like
condition to the ends I have really dry
hair so I've been loving using this I've
also been loving a new nail polish this
is by Chanel and it's gas song number
520 and I'm wearing it today it's not
very summery it's kind of more of an
autumn shade it's like a greeny grey
it's quite different I think it's really
smart very sophisticated I have also
been wearing China Glaze flip-flop
fantasy if you've seen me wear like a
neon orange nail polish that's that one
I don't love the formula of it it's
quite matte but the color is amazing
especially in the summer but this is
more of like an ottoman shade and I just
really liked it Chanel have changed
their formula so they're much better now
they don't chip quite as easily I've
also been enjoying this new lip balm
from Clarins it comes in this kind of
it's quite a girly packaging it's cute
though and it's it's very light weights
keeping your
it's just a basic wind-up lipstick style
lip balm but it smells incredible
smells like those peaches sweets you get
oh my god it's like insanely sweet but
not sickly like a refreshing ly sweet I
really really like it it makes you apply
more I feel like you love the scent or
taste of your lip balm you apply it more
regularly and I've really been enjoying
just keeping that on my desk and
applying it whenever my lips feel a bit
dry my final favorite is by a brand
called baked L and this is the jello
Roenick deep hydration serum I got sent
this and I've been using it for two
weeks and I absolutely love it but I'm
not gonna lie I just went to check the
price before doing this video and it's a
hundred pounds 100 pounds for a serum so
I was debating whether to still put it
in the video but I wanted to put it in
because I absolutely love it and
sometimes I fall out when you don't know
the price of something before you use it
it means you're using it without any
kind of preconceptions and before I need
the price I thought oh my god I'm never
not using the serum again and now I'm
like would I repurchase it I don't know
it is incredible I definitely would say
and I know I say this often whenever I
find a new serum I like but this is
definitely the best serum I've tried it
has that like hyaluronic acid feeling to
it where it's like very hydrating and
watery and fluid and really easy to
spread around the face but it doesn't
leave your skin feeling a bit like tight
which I find some Syrians do it feels so
hydrating I've heard so much about this
brand so I knew it was gonna be good but
yeah I'm really blown away by the serum
but it is 100 pounds so I guess it
depends what your budget is if you're
really into buying expensive skincare
then get that if not I think the one you
get from boots is also really good what
is it called in the little like tube
I'll link it down below
I'd say that's kind of like a similar
way more affordable option there are
real few products this month that I've
been disappointed in I try a lot of
things so there's always gonna be stuff
that I don't like as well I go through
mascaras very quickly I always try the
new mascara and I know after one
application whether I like it or not
there's always a lot that I'm
disappointed in I bought this before my
holiday before France I wanted to try
out some waterproof mascaras and I think
a lot of people recommended this it's
the Mac's act of two thousand calorie
water waterproof Volume Mascara
brush it's pretty good it's like a
medium-sized like fiber brush there's
not much to say about it other than it
didn't do great things for my lashes
when I wear a mascara I wanted to add a
lot of volume and thickness and length I
kind of want everything but this kind of
did nothing for them really definitely
it just kind of made me look like I
wasn't wearing any so I won't be using
that again I also was trying this from
hourglass this is the loom sheer color
trio so it's a palette with three shades
in it a bronzer a blusher and a
highlight and net all cream formulas I
really wanted to love this but I find
that the formula it's so greasy it's not
really like a cream it's like a really
oily you can kind of see the layer of
oil actually sitting on top it's very
oily in greasy and I found it didn't
really blend well it wasn't working it
was very patchy I tried to use it a few
times and it's just it's just not for me
maybe I'm using it wrong but personally
it's just it didn't work out for me
and then final dissappointed product
this is more disappointed because it was
so hyped up like I hiked up myself I got
sent a new range of origins products and
there's another product that I have
quite likes but this one I was just so
excited when I got it it's the peel-off
ginseng mask it is like this and it
comes out
seriously copper like a pure thick
copper color and it's incredible I
applied it all over my face
and I looked like some kind of like
robot it was amazing I was so excited I
tried not the back of my hand first and
it peeled off beautifully so I applied
it all over my face and the first thing
I found was that my eyes I didn't even
apply at that night to my eyes when my
eyes was streaming like watering like
crazy and I don't know why that was
maybe it's the smell it's quite heavily
scented my eyes felt like when I get a
Brazilian blow dry and they use the
chemicals that's how it felt like my
eyes were just streaming that was so
sore but I left it on it says leave on
until it dries and then peel it off so I
left it on and then when I started to
try and peel it off it didn't all come
off in one and I don't know if that's
because I didn't apply enough of a thick
layer but they were part they were
really fun it's like peeling PVC is it
PVC like glue off your fingers like from
when you're at school so parts of it
were really fun but after I'd done a few
I was just so bored of peeling this off
my face and it took so long to get every
bit off my face but I taking it off I
don't know if it was really like worth
it my skin felt quite soft but it also
but annotated from having to like peel
off all these different sections and I
had to go over with a muslin cloth like
a wet muslin cloth to get off the excess
that was still there so I was a bit
annoyed it wasn't as great as I wanted
it to be I am gonna try it again but
that was kind of like my first
impressions so products that I'm
currently testing out the first one is
from Lancome and this is their grandiose
liner this is one of the products that
lisa Eldred has created I think she's a
new like creative director maybe it is
very clever it's an eye liner and the
lid the lid moves like this the most
satisfying clicking noise ever I love it
it's a liquid liner and the idea is that
you can move the hand or depending on
how you want to apply it if you want to
apply it like that or you can do it
straight it kind of gives you more
angles to work with I've tried this out
a few times personally I find it easier
to just go straight on sometimes I do it
a bit to the side but personally I found
it a little bit messy I couldn't get
this to be like a perfect liner I'm not
sure if it's the formula or the
applicator but for me there's the Tom
Ford liner works much better for me so I
wasn't blown away by this but I do think
it's a clever idea and I think it will
help out some people who struggle with
eyeliner I'm also testing out this new
foundation from hourglass what is this
code oh god I can't know what this is
called it hasn't got the name on it but
it's the new like cream foundation I
will put all the details below so that
was a really loud fan I'm wearing this
today and I am really loving this
foundation it's meant to have the
coverage of a concealer like quite a
full coverage but not be a heavy cakey
foundation I've got two shades ivory and
nude and I'm somewhere in between so I'm
kind of using both at the moment but
nude is sort of working for me because I
have a bit of a tan it comes in this
like triangular kind of applicator and
you wind it up and just apply it
straight from the stick one thing I've
noticed that I've only used this like
two or three times and I've used a lot
of products so I think this is the sort
of foundation you're going through very
quickly but it's nice to apply like this
and there's nice to not have it all over
my hands I could do with liquid
foundation I then kind of pop it in with
a wet damp Beauty Blender and I find
this foundation just improves throughout
the day which is unlike anything else I
have when you first put it on it looks
really nice good coverage but natural as
well and then it just gets better
throughout the day as I start getting a
little bit
eally and places a little bit sweaty the
foundation just looks better and better
and I really like it as I said I'm
wearing it today you can't really to
take to the foundation anywhere I don't
know I'm still trying it out I haven't
like used it for that long yet but first
impressions I'm really impressed and I
really like it and then I wasn't going
to mention this but just to counteract
the peel-off mask that I mentioned in
the range is also an energy boosting
treatment lotion mist really long name
I'm trying this out as well I really
like how this feels on the skin but it's
quite a strong spray like I couldn't
spray it on now because it would ruin my
makeup it's definitely more of a
skincare spray it says you can spray all
throughout the day but I would just
spray this on clear skin and it's a very
kind of hydrating mist you can really
feel on the skin but it's nice so there
are a few people I've really been loving
on the internet this month and I thought
I'd give them a little shout out I love
it when people i watch recommend other
people because that's kind of how you
find the good people on the internet
first up is Lily Melrose and I've known
Linney for probably about six years now
I feel like we were part of like the
original little kind of London beauty
blogger crew but I've been really
enjoying her videos recently I feel like
she just makes content that she wants to
make and she's not influenced by
anything and she comes across as so
genuine in her videos and I just really
enjoyed watching them she puts up a mix
of like crazy interesting things and
then like basic stuff as well that you
just want to watch I really like her
haul videos I don't know it's something
about how she presents herself and how
she talks in her videos that it's just
really calming and genuine you can tell
she's just doing it because she enjoys
doing it she hasn't really changed much
over the 6 years and I love that because
I find it really comforting watching her
videos so go check out Lily Melrose his
YouTube channel I will link it down
below I've also been loving drew Scott I
discovered him maybe about six months
ago and I think I found him because he
put he puts up quite a few like
Instagram advice videos telling you kind
of how he edits his Instagram photos and
things like that and they're really
helpful his videos and instagrams are
just beautiful all the thumbnails are
gorgeous their shot beautifully you can
tell he really puts a lot of hard work
into his content and I've really been
enjoying I follow him on snapchat
Instagram YouTube so go check out her
stuff again I will link it down below
and then finally poppy days I
really have been enjoying her blog
recently you should go check it out if
you really like pretty photography she
does a mix of lifestyle fashion food
stuff and I find it very calming and
relaxing to just scroll through her blog
when I have a bit of time on my laptop
the image is all gorgeous and yeah I
think it's a really nice blog if you
haven't yet seen it people I've been
loving following on snapchat
I've been carry from wish wish wish I've
read her blog for again like maybe six
years her photography is always gorgeous
but it's so nice to see her on snapchat
because she hasn't always I think she
has a YouTube channel but she's not
massively into it so it's really nice to
see like one of your favorite bloggers
you usually just read and look at photos
like talking through her day and snap
chatting and she snapchats pretty much
every day and she's london-based and I
just I really like the way she does
snapchat also if you didn't see Rich's
now on snapchat which is so funny I
think he's really enjoying it and I'm
glad he's found like a social media that
he loves because he never got into
Twitter
I think Instagram he I couldn't deal
with the pressure because he's really
not into like photography so I think
snapchat is really enjoying just sharing
like snippets of his day so if you'd
like to follow rich on snapchat his user
name is rich G snaps and apologies if he
puts up anything weird but he's doing
well so far he always comes home at the
end of the day he's so proud he like
shows me he's a little snapshot story I
have one style favorite this month and
it's my ray-bans I bought these in LA I
was looking for round mirrored glasses
for so long but the classic ray-ban ones
really don't suit me they're just a bit
too small that I just looked like a pea
head but I found these when I was with
Anna and some like random sunglasses
shop opposite the Mondrian Hotel in LA
they are the fold up rain bath so they
come in this tiny little box and when
you take them out they are all folded up
like this it's really handy because it
means that they're small but I also find
it quite annoying because every time I
get my sunglasses out if I've got like
one hand I've got oh like unwrap them
all so I don't love the whole foldable
thing but they fold open like this and I
always feel like I'm gonna break them
and then they're slightly larger than
the original round ones they've got this
gold rim around the edge and then blue
and then they're blue mirrored and I put
them on and just thought yeah they're
perfect I mean I don't think they suit
me perfectly I think round glasses don't
release you anyone they're just quite a
weird thing to wear it's quite a
statement piece but definitely can
the smaller ones these suit me a lot
more and they add just something a
little bit different to your outfit I
really like the mirrored effect oh god I
hate folding these things I really feel
like I'm breaking them so I've been
wearing those pretty much like every day
when it's sunny since I bought them
everyone keeps asking me what the name
of these are so I'll put it in the
description box if you want to go and
buy some yourself okay so that's
everything and I really hope you enjoyed
