be talking through my June favorites I'm
sitting in a bit of a different setup
today because I had to get close to the
window as possible because it's the
hottest day of the year
and there's just no way I could have
filmed with lights so I'm basically
trying to get really close the windows
get a bit of light on my face but it's
just a bit of a bit of a funny setup and
I'm using my vlogging camera but let's
just go with it
I know people say this a lot but
seriously for me this month has
absolutely flown by I'm really busy and
June and July and then I feel like in
August things quieten down a bit but
June and July is going so so fast is
absolutely crazy
so try think of my favourites and it was
quite difficult to think of some but as
she wants I started writing them down
there have been a few things that I've
been loving there's a mix of beauty and
book and style and random favourites as
well let me start by telling you why I'm
wearing on my lips because I know I'll
get lots of questions this is an old
favourite of mine I've had this for
absolutely years it's a Tom Ford
while ginger lipstick comes as amazing
packaging Tom Ford lipsticks very
expensive but it's a very pretty like
orange e red shade it's not matte I
think it's very comfortable on the lips
anyway
okay now let's get on with the favorites
I think I'll start with Beauty get those
out the way you guys recently saw that I
went on a little press evening hotel
overnight stay thing was clinic it was
such a fun evening but in our bedroom in
our bathroom they put a collection of
different products from there take the
day off range I've only ever used the
solid cleansing balm which I really
really like I think I've already been
through one of those already I've never
tried this it was the take the day off
cleansing oil I think the last major
cleansing oil it was the body shop one I
used to really like that the chamomile
cleansing oil sounded a little bit messy
but I thought I'd give this a go I
really liked it I really enjoy using
this as my first cleanse it got a really
handy pump so I normally like two pots
of oil and just put straight on my face
all over my skin and my eyes as well it
takes my makeup off really quickly and
then I find that my skin is clean and I
can do a second cleanse with a cleanser
that's more for my skin like Oscar
renascence cleanser um turns in gel or
whatever other cleanser I want to use
but I feel like this is better just to
take your makeup off and then you can do
a proper second cleanse so I really like
this it's just so fast to take your
makeup off also for skincare I've been
loving that there's I don't look at men
this in a video before is the cat Berkey
vitamin C in tenses face cream I was
looking for an evening moisturizer and
Caroline hyerin's recommended this one
and I've really been enjoying it I've
used like a lot of this see only
moisturizer I use in the evening and
less I'm using an oil and then I'll just
use the oil bit of the vitamin C
enriched moisturizer it's very light
it's very hydrating it doesn't feel too
heavy on the skin smells really nice I
was kind of floral I think it was pretty
expensive so I remember I got it from
Space NK but I've really been enjoying
using it makes up with some body
products and if you listen to my Nana's
podcast when we interviewed Alexia in
the co-founder of cult Beauty she talked
a lot about therapy which is a brand I
already love I absolutely loved their
bath salts she really highly recommended
this which is the cherish skin repair
serum oh my god my bottle is already so
grubby this is such a beautiful body
serum it's kind of like a body oil I'm
not sure the difference is it feels like
an oil to me it's got all these amazing
ingredients in it smells incredible and
it just left my skin feeling so
moisturize I didn't feel I had wasted
time moisturizing my body and I hadn't
done anything it is quite heavy but if
you're happy to put on for bed you just
wake up with amazing skin also from
therapy I've been loving these these are
the crystal-clear smelling salts so you
can like this a little tight and also
comes with this extra essence and
basically inside are these amazing
crystals and they smell incredible it's
very similar to the bath salts the idea
is that if you're feeling stressed or
anxious which often I am especially oh
I'm sitting at my desk just smell these
you like breathe them in it says take
the lid off inhales deeply three to five
times or place on your desk and with the
lid open for continue to support oh man
it just smells like calm but if they
really really work if you're sort of
presently get quite nervous and anxious
in certain situations like try these out
I think once the smell stop wearing off
you just add a little bit more of the
essence onto the crystals and I've
really been enjoying these this has been
my lip balm of choice for the past like
six months I've almost finished it the
Nivea original care I think Anna
recommended this look that's literally
all I've got left I've been using this
to death and it's been the only thing
that's really been hydrating my lips
they're not as dry they used to be but
this is just such a good easy lip balm I
breathe in
if you saw my light layered glowy makeup
tutorial that I did recently you would
have seen me using the Charlotte Tilbury
wonder glow which is an old favorite of
mine that just kind of fallen back in
love with you can use this as a primer
all over your skin or you can just like
dust it on your cheekbone down your nose
it's a liquid highlighter but it's not
glittery it's not seriously seriously
highlighting it's just like Joey gives
you it's like Julie glow if it's instant
soft focus Beauty flash it's so nice
love that here's a bit of a random favor
if you saw my blog rich and I went to
the SIP Smith gin Factory and a
distillery always color factory and it
was so so interesting they gave us one
of their sips miss London cup gins and
I've just been loving this like I'm
really into gin and tonic this is kind
of like the Pimm's is like gins answer
two pins basically it's fruity and
summery and very easy to drink so I
think you mix this is the flavour to gin
and then he makes this like tonic water
or ginger ale or whatever you want to
mix it with and it's so so nice whenever
I go to bar now I'm going to ask their
London cottage gym because I really like
it I picked up these sunglasses when I
was an airport going to Lisbon they are
foam products got them from world gc3
I've been looking for some big oversized
sunglasses for a while I want sunglasses
that when I'm especially one annoying
makeup board early in the morning I
could just put them on and they kind of
hide my face I've got a really small
face so often I try on these like style
of sunglasses especially like the Saline
ones everyone has and they just don't
see me I really struggle to find
sunglasses assuming I know that sound
surprising considering how many I've got
but it always takes me ages to find some
that look good these are some part I had
a voucher which was very nice and they
looked like this I mean they are huge
but I think that's kind of the point I
just want to embrace the oversized look
oh and I really like them they've got it
all a metal bit in the bridge they're
not too too dark I think that that's the
key they're not too heavy on my face and
they're very light to wear and they're
very comfortable
this is from Prada I will link those
down below if I can find the link don't
favorite is a book and it is ice cream
for breakfast by Laura Jane Williams
look how cute a cover of this is but
this is a really nice kind of easy read
to be fair though even though it's an
easy reader taking me ages I just have
no free time for reading I try and read
in the evening when I'm lying in bed but
I've just really been enjoying this
basically about it's nonfiction and
Laura found herself at there kind of
highlight of her career she was at her
own book Florence for one of her first
books and she realized that she was just
really unhappy and she decided to kind
of critical to become a full-time nanny
which is really not at all what she was
doing and from doing that I think she
learned how to change her mindset and
embrace life's like a child and the
whole book is about like through a
child's eye and would like to make
decisions and live life and I don't know
it's interesting that there are sections
I'm like I'm not really into like
writing in books you know you can I fill
things out but there definitely some key
things I'm taking away from the book as
I read it they're making me feel a bit
more chilled about life I've been loving
my Topshop sliders let me see if I can
show you these properly kind of hard on
this camera I did a shoot with a
magazine which I think I still can't
tell you about I think it's coming out
in July and the stylist was wearing
those in khaki green and she just looked
so cool she was wearing this like white
shirt like loose trousers and then these
sliders and they looked so cool so I
went to at the top shop there are only
20 pounds there's loads they're the ones
that are like hanging on the wall and
they're so comfortable I got my nerve 6
which is the size that I am so they fit
to have shoe size and they're quite wide
like a bit like how Birkenstocks are
they're quite wide on the foot so
they're really really comfortable
they've occasionally slipped off my foot
when I'm walking somewhere fast but
apart from that I've just really been
loving them I think type of pair for my
sister's birthday because she
desperately wanted some as well just
been enjoying wearing them I have two
favorites that I can't show you one is a
restaurant recommendation I'm sure if
you've been watching my blog or my
Instagram stories you'll know what it is
but stressing o'clock it's on Commercial
Street in East London line is
Butterfield
it's very opposite Urban Outfitters if
you know the area and it it's Israeli
food it's so good I had a BS wife it has
shot shoot for the first time which was
delicious and it comes with like pizza
bread to dip in and then the second time
I had like turkey shwarma with a fried
egg on top so it was literally like
pizza bread turkeys like shredded turkey
pool Turkey whatever and then a Friday
again I just I can't even explain how
delicious it is it's definitely one of
my favourite restaurants
I hope there's are more because it's a
bit of an awkward area to get to in
terms of public transport
I hope there's one in LA
central London because it's so delicious
I just can't stop thinking about that
turkey drama it's so good
my last favorite I'm a bit embarrassed
to say but it's love island I've never
watched it before and it's such crap TV
but it's so good and like for me just
having like an hour half an hour to
switch off every night and just watch
stuff on TV like I often watch it wasn't
doing my emails or like browsing on my
phone it's not like a serious thing that
we watch but bitter I've been watching
it and it's just kind of easy easy
watching and it's funny I'm really
liking Camila I think she's a very cool
girl and Marcel from blazing squad is
just love him let me know if you guys
are also watching love Ireland I can't
believe I am it's really not my kind of
thing but I'm just embracing it so those
all of my favorite on Wednesday I've got
a really kind of special video coming up
that I've been working really hard on
and I got really confused in the vlog
that I was filming last week I thought
it was going up Wednesday but it's not
it's going to go up next Sunday so if
you're watching my next vlog in thinking
what is she talking about it's not
Wednesday she's got her days confused
that is why
sorry strange in your vlogging for the
week after it's hard to like remember
the days anyway it's been really
enjoyable filming without lights on this
little camera so let me know what you
think because if you don't mind I might
do this more often
thanks for all of your support on the
Liz Elle episode on our podcast at home
with that when I put Wednesday it was
such an enjoyable one to record so I'm
really glad you guys enjoyed it I'm
heading off to New York tomorrow I
absolutely can't wait so expect lots of
content from their instagrams and the
vlogging and maybe they'll be a haul if
I do some shopping so I hope you all
have a really good week and I'll see you
on Wednesday for my next video and
thanks so much for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
