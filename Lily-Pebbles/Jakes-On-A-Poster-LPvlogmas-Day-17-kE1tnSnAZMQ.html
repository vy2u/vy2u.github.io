everyone on Twitter has told me it's the
best in Vienna my ears are still a
little bit blocked

quite dry in our room so I kept waking

pharmacy and then head to Jake's flat

outside
we're now back at Jake's flat and I'm
pretty shattered from walking around we
just came back as I hope that my vlog
would be uploaded but it's only 87% it's
been going all day so I think it's gonna
take another hour so on Friday if
there's no vlog up at 6:30 that's
because I didn't have time to upload it
before flying back to London so then it
might be up Saturday morning or late
Friday night I'm not sure I have time to
do this again tomorrow Jake's made me
honey lemon and ginger I've been nothing
but the video is finally uploaded would
you leave Jake and we're gonna go at the
hotel and change and then we're gonna
see him in his opera and then see you
afterward
yes so break your leg you can't really
see yell it worse than I do
we have about five maybe 10 minutes to
get changed all we have five minutes we
have to go to Jake's opera we're gonna
be late I feel so rough but I'm gonna
just change my trousers jumper there
that's it I'm sorry I've been moaning so
much in this vlog
I think I'm ready I've just changed my
jumper and jeans and boots I'm not gonna
do my makeup carry of half an hour to
get there now I think that's doable are
we going on the train neither of us know

definitely not allowed to film but so
proud he was so good

him backstage thing you have to get used
to if you're one of Jake's crew pieces
that he's always the last to come out

quick like but they I couldn't film so
they don't know they they think I made
it up I did I filmed your applause I'm
doing interval call quickly no notice my
daughter grades we went out for some
pizza after the Opera I didn't vlog
because I was like Jake and his singing
friends and now we're back at the hotel
