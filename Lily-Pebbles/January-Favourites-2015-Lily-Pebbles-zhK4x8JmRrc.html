again it's monthly favorites and in this
video I'm gonna be talking through all
the products I've been loving interact
January I'm gonna get straight into it
and the first product is the most random
one and some non beauty products if you
follow me on Instagram
you may have seen that I purchased a
label maker this is so random it's not
even a fancy label maker it's like the
most basic one you can get which I got
on purpose it's like one from the 80s I
got this on Amazon it was about 8 pounds
and it's an old-school label maker you
put in like my prize black tape and you
literally have to turn this to get the
letter you want and then you press it
really hard and it embosses white
letters or numbers onto a piece of
sticky tape as you guys know I like to
scrapbook and I like to be quite
organized so this has already been put
to good use I have labeled all my makeup
I have been using it on my scrapbook
I've even labeled my label maker this is
Lily's label maker I feel like that's
very Monica and Friends I'm completely
addicted to this I sit in bed making
labels and it's not quiet it makes a
really loud noise so rich gets so
annoyed but I love it and I was 88
pounds and it brings me a lot of
happiness so if you like to be organized
and you like kind of old-school sticky
labels then get yourself a label maker
from Amazon love this it's a dynamo one
by the way while I'm on non Beauty
favorites I may as well tell you about
my next non Beauty favorites which is
actually a music soundtrack and it's
from the film chef if you haven't seen
the film chef I would highly recommend
it I've seen it 5 times now it's one of
those funds you can just watch over and
over again if you love food like I do
you will love this film it's just such a
feel-good happy film is so well directed
and the photography or filmography is
that a word just it's amazing it makes
you absolute are being don't watch it
when you're hungry have a Cuban sandwich
nearby trust me you will need one and
it's such a great film anyway the
soundtrack is really good I've been
listening to it on Spotify I have that
app on my phone it's just such like a
feel-good happy soundtrack I actually
find it really good to work cheap as a
lot of the songs the instrumental so
when I'm doing work I like to have a bit
of music in the background it's great
for parties like dinner party casual
parties just listen to it hopefully
you'll like that sort of music I
absolutely love it ok so now let's get
onto the good stuff the beauty favorites
and I'm going to start with
nail polish I've been absolutely loving
the new nail polish from Chanel's spring
collection which is coming up soon
it's called tenderly I've been wearing
this on my nails for the past couple of
weeks I haven't got it on now obviously
and I really like it and in the past
I've complained about Chanel nail
polishes chipping for some reason this
one didn't chip on me at all I don't
know if it's the condition of my nails
although they're not great at the moment
maybe they'd be formulated something
about this color in particular was fine
on my nails and I loved the shade but I
did do a blog post with a dupe if you
can't afford a Chanel nail policial so
you don't want to splash out on a nail
polish this one is a really good deep
it's from Bourjois from their Solak
range and it's called fashion gris-gris
I think it's called it's slightly less
pink than the shell one but it's very
similar can I give the same effect I
think it's such a chic easy to wear
color goes with so many different
outfits especially if he likes what a
black like I do and yeah I've been
loving these two shades next up is a
blusher that I've been loving I have so
many of the Tarte Amazonian clay blushes
but actually have too many that's a
little bit overwhelming and I don't tend
to use them that often not as often as I
should do but I took one of them out of
my like spare makeup collection and put
it into my daily makeup and so I've been
encouraging myself to use this one and
I've fallen back in love with it this
one is called blissful so these are
really long lasting blushes they're
meant to last like is it 12 or 24 hours
12 hours and they do lasts all day and
they're really really great for Nia this
one's like a slightly orange e peachy
pink really easy to wear quite bright
though it's not that subtle I'm wearing
it today and if you can see I really
really like it I just love the formula
of these they blend so easily they feel
really like smooth on your cheeks and I
love the packaging another makeup
favorite and this won't be a surprise to
you guys because I've already spoken so
much about this foundation it was in my
haul it was in my January makeup routine
and I've done a blog post on it it's
from Kiko it's the universal fit
hydrating foundation this is 6-pound 90
which is incredible for a foundation of
this quality comes in a great to be
packaging which is great for traveling
and it's just a really hydrating
foundation that's not too lightweight it
still gives good coverage it's like a
medium coverage that can actually be
built up because it's hydrating it is
good if you have slightly drier skin I
think this just looks
so pretty much buffed in if you want to
see an action I use this in my January
makeup routine video so I will link that
video in the description box below and
yeah I've been loving this 6.90 Kiko is
just amazing I have quite a few skincare
favorites this month so I'm gonna run
through those quickly now the first one
is from Sunday Riley I've tried quite a
few things from Sunday Riley before
because my mom is a huge fan shield is
it from cult beauty and as soon as she
runs out she repurchases she literally
couldn't live without Sunday Riley stuff
so I recently started trying the good
genes which is a corrective treatment
now it says on this it's for brightening
refining and plumping it brightens
exfoliates plumped lines
evens hyper pigmentation and increases
circulation for instant radiance I use
this as a treatment after I've done on
my cleansing and all that before my kind
of evening moisturizer I absolutely
despise the smell of this just gonna put
that out there really can't stand the
smell I'm not sure what it is but
something about it I can't stand but
it's a really really amazing product it
does feel slightly tingly on the skin
which I've quite liked because you feel
like it's really working
I would suggest though not putting this
on after you've like squeezed any spots
or foliated your skin because the tingle
enos can be quite intense but on a
normal day when your skin is like not
raw or red and you haven't got that many
kind of like open spots
sorry that's a really good thing to say
this just feels nice and tingly on the
skin and I feel like it instantly
smooths out my skin I can really feel
the difference in the texture of my skin
after using this you do go through it
quite quickly my mom said that she goes
through these so quickly and I thought
oh she must be using too much but I'm
going through mine quite quickly as well
and it's very pricey so just science
bear in mind this might be out of your
budget but if it is in your budget it's
a great product you don't need a full
pump you get quite a lot out of one pump
so I always use like half a pump but it
just feels amazing on the skin I tend to
use it more in the evenings but you can
use it morning and evening this month I
have been suffering quite a bit from
hormonal spots I don't get that spotty
but once a month sometimes I can get a
little bit spotty and this is one of
those months unfortunately it's probably
all the chocolate from Christmas so I've
been using two masks to help combat to
my spots my favorite thing for treating
spots is using like a clay mask nothing
too intense I really went off the
origins clear improvement mask because I
found that to remove it I'd end up
really having to scrub at my face and
making it
red and raw so I like clay masks that
feel really intense when they're on but
come off easily as well and I've got two
that I've been loving this month my old
favorites which is just always gonna be
in my collection is the ISA parsley seed
mask I love this stuff I've nearly
finished another cheap I think I've gone
through three or four of these feels
really cooling it's quite a thin clay
mask so it doesn't kind of you know some
clay masters give you like a block of
color it's not really like that it dries
like all patchy and it's just a lovely
mask
sometimes I just use this on certain
areas sometimes I put it all over my
skin I've also been enjoying this one
from Liz Earle which is their deep
cleansing mask and both of these
actually suck when I apply with my hand
I'm sure why me because it's thinner but
the little one I like to apply with a
foundation brush this is more of like a
thick clay mask it's a bit more like the
origins one but I find that it washes
off easier so I apply it with a
foundation brush just so you can kind of
get it more but exactly where you want
it and I feel like it really kind of
draws the spots out of my skin and it
gets so hard and nice but then I could
just remove it either with the muslin
cloth or it comes with these little kind
of sponges which makes it quite easy to
remove as well I just find as long as
your sponge or muslin cloth is really
wet then it removes quite easily but
both of these masks have been really
helping with my spotty skin this month
okay two more favorites to go and this
next one I've absolutely been loving
this this month its new is from Clarins
and it's cooled what's it called their
instant light lip comfort oil so this is
part of their instant light little
family I love the instant light lip
perfectors the new instant like balms I
really like as well but this is the one
that had to go in my favourites because
it's so good it's a lip oil and when my
skin that feels dry I always go straight
for oils oils just they sink into the
skin quicker they make my skin feel
nourished like immediately I never
really thought about putting oil on my
lips before until this it basically
comes with this really strange
applicator it's gonna make a really
weird noise it was a bit of a bit of a
gross noise there but it comes to this
huge applicator that I absolutely love
is like a big sponge applicator it
really fits the bottom lip especially
like perfectly and it just coats on like
this thick layer of oil that sinks into
the lips and it makes them feel so
moisturized I'm so picky with lip balm I
like cream lip balms
I hate lip balms that have like
petroleum in them that light will slippy
because it just dries out my lips in the
long-term it defeats the whole purpose
of a lip balm but this oil is so great
I'd really recommend it if you are
suffering from dry lips I get really dry
lips especially because I I'm putting on
a lipstick and taking it off all the
time for my videos and this has been a
bit of a lifesaver this month I really
like it I think it's just this one some
reason I feel like there's two I'm not
sure I'll look it up but I'll leave all
the links to the products are mentioning
in the description box so finally if you
read my blog you may have seen my
blogpost about falling back in love with
eyelash curlers I never usually curl my
lashes because I'm quite lucky I was
blessed with quite long curly lashes
people always compliment me on my lashes
and I always feel really guilty because
people get really angry they're like I'm
so jealous of your lashes but I got crap
hair so let me have the lashes but
recently they haven't really been doing
what I want this to do they haven't been
curling they haven't been looking very
long this has been a bit rubbish so I
thought I'd go back to my lash curlers
that I normally use on special occasions
when I'm going out these are from sure
mirror I'm Charlotte Tilbury do great
ones too but I've just been using these
before I put my mascara on and it's made
a world of difference I haven't tried
waterproof mascara yeah I know that
really helps with keeping a curl in your
lashes too but for now this is doing the
trick and I've been using it everyday
I'm just trying to integrate it into my
daily routine it's just one more step to
do and it makes all the difference it
really kind of widens up my eyes and
makes my mascara do what it's supposed
to do I feel like it gives them a little
warning like mascara is coming so get
ready here's a little curler so I've
been loving these this month okay so
those are my favorites I really hope you
enjoyed hearing what they all are and I
hope you guys have a really nice Sunday
