before I start my monthly favorites I
just wanted to say thank you to everyone
who subscribes to my channel if you
don't yet subscribe go click the
subscribe button because then you get an
alert every time I upload a new video
which is twice a week and I don't want
you guys to miss out on any future
videos this is the first time I filmed
with my new hair so I hope you guys like
it I got it cut and colored at hirtius
ins and Jason the guy that always does
my color did such a good job with the
balayage I absolutely loved it
so like every month I'm gonna be talking
through my favorite products it's not
just product this month there's a lot of
style items lifestyle bits and a social
media handle as well so let's start with
the Instagrammer that I've absolutely
loved this month she's called patty and
she runs the Instagram page called bake
DDoS I think that's how you say it and
they're just the cutest biscuits I've
ever seen the things that she makes into
biscuits I don't know how she does it
and they're so cute and I love the
images and I find myself like
double-tapping everything that she
uploads so go and check her Instagram
page out the second thing I've been
loving is my new coat from whistles and
I did that thing where I went in to look
at the sale you guys know I'm really not
a fan of sales I normally find them
really stressful but shops like whistles
they keep their same kind of tidy layout
so you just feel like you're shopping
not in a sale but the promise of cheaper
so that's really good and this was down
from like 250 pounds which is crazy for
a coat down to like 130 and I was arming
an AR and I tried it on absolutely loved
it but I just thought 130 pounds still
feels like so much money when I don't
really need any more coats that have so
many I eventually just convinced myself
I'm gonna do it got to the till and it
was actually 80 pounds I've been reduced
again and I love when that happens I was
so happy and I think 80 pounds with this
coat is a really good deal what's it
made out of and we have a little look
it's like a wool mix and it's really
long and oversized which is just how I
like my coats it's the style that I
personally really like and it's a mix of
a light grey and a dark grey and it has
a hood which I like because I don't
really carry umbrellas around with me
but in London when it does that kind of
light spitting rain my hair goes so
frizzy so it's nice just to have an
option to put a hood up when it's
raining it's got a big zip too big
pockets and I absolutely love it
I know it's not the most flattering
thing ever but I
think it's really cool and I've been
wearing it every day since I got it you
may have seen this in the background of
some of my videos it's a candle from
West Elm I picked this up in the sale
just after Christmas and I really like
it it's a three wick candle I also have
a smaller version but I like it because
of the bowl it's so different and unique
and I love that once I finish burning
the candle I I'll be able to use the
ball for like nuts or little crisps and
I have people around it's a pretty like
mint green color and I love it smells
like fresh greenery the next favorite is
actually this earring which I am wearing
now and it's from a brand called aralia
which you can get in Topshop and I
really like it it's just goes into one
hole and then you kind of twist up and
it's I don't know what they're called
where they kind of got up your ear and
it's rose gold or gold stars and I
really really love it I feel like it
makes it look like you've got more
pieces than you actually have it's very
comfortable to wear and I'm enjoying
kind of trying on new earrings now that
my piercings have healed I've still got
the original earrings in these two these
ones are from shop anomie I think and I
really need to get some more earrings so
if you guys have any recommendations on
where to go I don't want to spend a
fortune but I also don't want them to
infect my ear so on to be good quality
so let me know where you buy your
earrings from and the next favorite if
there haven't been any beauty favorites
yet dunno what's going on but I'm just
into loads of other stuff at the moment
as well this is the eye ring and my
sister bought this to me for my birthday
and I've had so many questions about it
both on here and just in real life
people are like what is that on your
phone she picked up in Hong Kong and
apparently it's all the craze there wait
did she go to Hong Kong Korea she goes
to Hong Kong and Korea a lot so I can't
remember which one maybe this was from
Korea I'm not sure but it's called the I
ring and it's basically a little square
that you stick on to the back of your
phone that's probably the only thing I
don't like about it it is quite easy to
take off and on if you want to change
your phone case but I kind of wish it
was magnetic or something and it has
this metal ring attached now this metal
ring can like move all the way around so
I use this both as a stand because I
watch youtube videos all the time so
when I'm doing my makeup I can just
stand it on the table or whenever I want
to use it as a stand basically and
another thing I use it for which when my
sister was like you can put it on like a
ring I thought she
literally insane but do you ever do that
thing where you're lying in bed looking
at your phone and then you accidentally
drop it on your face and it really
really hurts or you're lying on your
side and then you keep dropping on the
floor I find this really handy I just
put it around my finger and then I can
kind of just hold my phone like in any
angle or like that and it won't drop on
my face it's so weird but so handy it
does bulk up the back of your phone a
tiny bit so you can't really lay it
completely flat but it's quite small and
for me it's also worth it because I use
this every single day I don't know if
you can get them here but maybe your
Amazon I'll see if I can find a link
January has definitely been the month
for lips
I've got majorly back into lipstick I
feel like over Christmas I just got
really lazy with it sometimes I go
through phases where I just can't be
bothered to put a lipstick this month
I've been loving experimenting with my
lips and there's a few different
lipsticks and liquid lipsticks that I've
been loving so the first combination
I still love Mac saw and mer I wear it
all the time but I also loved this
combination this is a lip liner from
Lancome and it's the beige rose and this
is part of their contour lip liners that
ever you know difference doing the
contour ones and the normal ones but
it's a really nice lip liner it comes
with a brush on the other end which I
never use this is Lisa Eldridge is
favorite shade she told me herself when
I met her so I went and got it straight
away and it's a really nice nude lip
liner that means that you can just fill
out your lips a little bit and define
the edges and then I like to go on top
with the Laura Mercier spiced rose
lipstick which I think I've mentioned
before in a favorites video Tanya burr
actually recommended this I think she
wore on her wedding day and it's a
really pretty slightly Brown II Rose
nude shade a little bit darker a little
bit Kylie Jenner really hydrating and
moisturizing and these two together I
feel like make my lips look fuller and
just really nice I've got a blog post on
these so I will link that down below if
you want to see photos and I've also
been loving liquid lipsticks I've got
back into them in a major way if you saw
my matte liquid lipsticks video I just
got really excited about that launch and
it made me want to try all the other
liquid lipsticks there's so many that we
can't get hold of in the UK or can't get
hold of easily with that pain huge
shipping costs like Oprah is that how
you say it and anastasi has liquid
lipsticks that aren't sold on cult
Beauty and there's a few that I really
want to try colour-pop so I really
this come to the UK soon but I have been
really enjoying the Mac ones I said in
my Mac video that this nude one called
back in vogue didn't really suit me but
I have been embracing it and I really
like it now and the one I'm wearing
today is from stealer stealer do really
nice liquid lipsticks and they've got
some new shades coming out soon which
are really kind of on trends like your
brownie colours applicator is quite long
and a little bit messy but if you just
take your time the formulas so nice
because I find that these ones are the
best ones for layering
you can keep layering these up all day
all night and then never go like dry and
crusty so I really like the shade which
is called aria another product I've been
using almost every day this month is
from Becca and this is the back light
priming filter so it's a primer but it's
very glowy I can glow from within it's
not too shimmery and sparkly it's just
really really pretty and I've really
enjoyed layering it under my foundation
I'm wearing it today I don't know if it
makes that much of a difference but it
feels great and no it doesn't smell
great I don't know why I just smell that
I really like this I love Becca products
at the moment cashmere socks these
things are the best things in the world
I have them in every color they're from
the white company I have them in the
cream I have them in the light gray and
I have them in the dark gray I think
there's a pink as well but I'm not
really a pink kind of girl I wear these
pretty much every night I walk around
the house in there I normally put my
slippers on so they don't want to ruin
them and then I normally sleep in them
because our flats were really cold at
the moment because we haven't got double
glazed windows and all that so they're
so comfortable and amazing they're 35
pounds which for socks seems ridiculous
but I got one pair as a Christmas
present and I got another when it was
like 20% off and they really are just
they make me so happy the next thing I
cannot believe I'm putting in a
favorites video so I have a proper
love-hate relationship with the Beauty
Blender it's one of those products that
I see people use and I always want to
buy it and then I use it and then I hate
it and I give it away or throw it away
and then I always end up buying another
one and that's been going on for years
and then recently when I was in Boots
I saw the Real Techniques sponge and I
don't think I'd really process I've seen
people use this before but I hadn't read
processed how much cheaper is than the
Beauty Blender so there's so much less
risk involved in buying this if I didn't
like it it's not the end of the world
Beauty Blender is so expensive so I
picked up one of the Real Techniques
sponges and I've been
using this with my foundation and
concealer and I absolutely love it
I do find I'm sticking with my original
opinion on the Beauty Blender is that it
is a faff and I get so bored doing this
for ages and blending in my foundation
and my concealer but if you have the
time I can't believe the difference it
makes May because my skin is more dry
because it's winter glass finding that
with the buffing brush my foundation was
looking really cakey if you look at the
MAC liquid lipstick video that I filmed
my skin and my foundation just looks
like it is sitting on top of my skin and
masking in I really hated what my makeup
looked like in that video so go back and
look at that video and compare it to
today because this it just makes your
foundation blend into your skin
beautifully you wet it under the tap and
then squeeze out all the water and then
use it damp which just feels so weird
but if you're into dewy glowy skin the
mix of the water and the foundation
really really works and I also find that
it blends in concealer really well I
used to have to put on like layers of
concealer when I was blending it in but
by tapping it in with this I don't have
to put on a second layer so I'm a
massive fan I also really like the shape
of this one I use the pointed end for my
foundation and the flat end for like
areas my chin pointy end around my eyes
and I really really like it I haven't
figured out quite yet how to clean it I
think I've used it a few times now so I
should probably clean it I'm not sure
how I'm gonna do that but at least
they're not really expensive if you need
to buy new ones so yeah if you have the
patience in the time give the Real
Techniques sponge a go because I think
it's great my final favorite is the
Netflix series making a murderer people
were talking about this so much and I
hate the hype so I just kind of ignored
it and then eventually me and rich gave
in because my family started watching it
and they were talking about it I was
like okay I need to watch it wait a
minute it's basically a documentary
about a guy called Steven Avery who was
put in jail for 18 years and then
released because they found out that he
didn't actually do the crime and you
learned all of that in the first episode
so don't worry I haven't ruined anything
and then he gets accused of another
trial and that's what the whole kind of
series is about and you watched the
court case and it's really really
interesting a lot of people saying it's
quite bias because the people who filmed
it but either way whether you think he's
guilty or not guilty it's really
interesting to learn about the evidence
and the court case and it
so so grippy because it's a real story
there's no actors it's a real
documentary and being rich absolutely
loved it and found it fascinating we
kind of watched it all in about a week I
think so if you have Netflix watch that
also after that we weren't sure what to
watch and I watched something called
twin stirs on Netflix which is about a
girl on YouTube who finds out she's got
an identical twin across the other side
of the world very different but also if
I'm not quite interested
so apparently lovely Netflix this month
those are my January favorites I hope
you guys enjoyed that don't forget to
subscribe to my channel if you haven't
yet and I'll see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
