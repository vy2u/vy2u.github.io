Christmas sadly passed its goodbye to
the warm twinkle light lit backgrounds
and back to the bright minty fresh
background so before I get started with
my January hits and misses I just
quickly went to ask you guys for my next
video I want to do a Q&amp;amp;A because I never
really do anything like that where I
just sit and chat and answer any
questions you guys might have so before
you start watching this video please
comment down below on this video with
any question you have for me it can be
beauty related or not beauty related
anything you like really and I'll pick
some and answer them for my next video
so let's get started with my January
hits and misses and I wanted to do hits
and misses this month instead of January
favorites because it's been no money
month on my blog and on my YouTube a bit
as well I've been buying a lot of
products and testing at more products
than i usually am so I've come across
more kind of misses and disappointed
products then I usually do because
normally I go and buy something that I
know I'm going to like but this month
I've just been buying kind of everything
to test it out so I've got a few things
that I've been quite disappointed with
but then lots of new favorites as well
to add into the collection so my first
hit this month has been the gosh flower
power blush and I had tarty talking
about this if you don't watch tities
videos i'll link them below she makes
videos every day which is insane but
they're amazing and this blush is from
gosh so it's really affordable you can
get it from superdrug it's a really
pretty kind of everyday pink and I've
become obsessed with this I literally
wear it every day I'm wearing it now
I've worn it every day I think in
january i find it so hard to wear any
other blush at the moment because this
is perfect you never apply too much I've
just noticed that it's kind of broken a
bit that's sad hopefully it will
hopefully it won't smash but I
absolutely love this blush it's really
kind of makes you look flushed and it's
like pretty and pink not too much just
perfect my next hit is the Maybelline
falsies the big eyes mascara so I've had
the falsies mascara for a long time and
i really like it's what i'm wearing
today this is like an update of that so
it's a double-ended mascara on the top
there's a brush for the upper lashes and
on the bottom there's one for the lower
chisholm i use this in my drugstore
makeup tutorial which was my last video
so if you haven't seen that i will link
it below and you can see this in action
but i really like it the brush is
slightly different to the original
falsies it's not as big and it's
slightly kind of twisted but it works
just as well and the lower lash brush is
really good and small so you can get the
little lashes and I think this is an
amazing drugstore mascara I'd definitely
recommend talking about mascara I'm
gonna throw in a couple of misses now
and they are both mascaras I come across
a lot of drugs some scores i don't like
just because i don't know a lot of them
just don't do anything for me there's
some amazing ones like Maybelline the
rocket the full sees soap &amp;amp; Glory thick
and fast i think it's called there's
something i love but then quite a lot of
them i feel like when i apply then they
just do nothing to my lashes i can't
even explain it it kind of makes them
look more thin and bear than they
actually are so too i tried this month
and instantly just knew I didn't like
first of all um l'oreal the miss manga
collection this has had crazy marketing
and advertising i've seen it everywhere
on youtube I've seen it like in
magazines billboards TV it's like got a
huge campaign behind it and I really
like the advertising like images and
stuff so I picked this up install and I
think I got the waterproof version as
well since the mega volume miss manga
and I just this just there's no other
way to explain it often it did nothing
for my lashes it's got a nice kind of
bendy tip which I really like and it's a
tapered brush which means it's good to
get in like the corners but it just
didn't do anything for my lashes i think
my scorers work differently on everyone
so don't let me put you off but this one
didn't work for me and the other one
that didn't work at all is the max
factor excess volume extreme impact
mascara and this is actually a new one
and it's cool it comes with its like
giant packaging and it's got one step
and it's got it's basically got two
steps so the first one is giant thick
brush and the second step is like a
tapered brush um and it's black and I
didn't want to say it just didn't like
it it didn't work tool for my lashes so
that was a shame but I'm yeah as I said
I really liked the full sees big eyes
one another hit this month has been and
this Rimmel I shadow palette and it's
the glamour eyes HD in brick
turn brown this was recommended to me by
anna of course like most products that i
love our own we filmed a daily mix video
together and she got this out and I was
like that looks amazing I have to get it
and it looks like this it's got five
shades in it champagne a light taupe a
medium brown and dark brown and then a
really nice kind of rusty red shade in
the middle some people don't love the
pigmentation of these shadows but I
think they're really decent and I really
like the quality of them I just love the
shade selection I think it's so good and
it's very comparable to the Charlotte
Tilbury dolce vita palette which I love
this one only has four shades and the
quality of the shadows this needs a
little bit more buttery but very similar
shades it's definitely a good deep I've
done a post of this on my blog so I'll
link that below I really love this
palette that I've been using it a lot
this one another miss now is the Max
Factor smokey eye effect eyeshadow I
thought this would be a really good dupe
for the clinique chubby stick for eyes
because it's like a cream shadow stick
one side it's got this really nice
champagne II color and the other side
it's got a really nice kind of shimmery
brown the colors I think a spot on I
really love them this so nice to blend
together put champagne you want all over
my lid and then the brown in the crease
and you can blend it your fingers it's
like the most easy on-the-go deskside
beauty product the only problem is this
creases so badly I'd say after like 20
minutes of having it on my lids I went
to look in the mirror and I had such a
bad like line of cream right in my
crease and that's just a big no-no for
me with cream shadows they they have to
be able to like stand at least a few
hours without creasing I tried it with
primer as well and it didn't make any
difference they obviously just a little
bit too creamy so that's a massive shame
because this would have been the perfect
product otherwise but it did crease on
me another hit for me this month has
been the key code nail polishes and
actually only have one I've got this
shade which is amazing electric blue
shade I think it actually is hasn't got
the name it just says 336 I think it's
called electric blue because I've done
it person this as well so I'll link that
below and i really like these are there
really affordable Keiko's just an
amazing brand I love the cream eye
shadow sticks as well but the nail
polish is really good i was really
impressed with it they've got so many
shades
as well and I was really happy that I
like this because I have the key code
nail case i do have shown this in a
video before it's like a little nail
place for like traveling and it has all
space for like your manicure stuff and
then in the bottom there's a space for
nail polishes and when I first got this
i thought was a bit annoying that
they're the shape of the keycode
polishes because you can squeeze like SC
and bobby brown in there but really
they're meant for kike polishes but now
I know how great they are I'm just going
to go out and buy like a few more and
then if I ever go away i can just take
my key to it polishes away in this and i
really like the shape of the bottle as
well so i'm going to go back and see
what the shades they have because i was
really impressed with the quality of
this and they're really easy to apply
any last well don't chip and yeah
they're really affordable another miss
this month have been the superdrug
cotton wool pad I know this sounds like
a random one but I by the big oval
cotton wool all the time I usually buy
it these ones from boots and I using to
take my makeup off and sometimes my face
i'm using a bit bioderma i don't use
them for nails they just use them for my
face and I bought these ones were super
job because I was in superdrug anyway
and I just thought they'd be the same as
the boots ones but they're awful they
are so harsh and they're not soft a tool
so if you when i use them on my eyes on
my face I just get such redwar eyes or
raw face and it just really made my face
like go red and sore and I was just
shocked at how rough they were and it
really made such a difference to my skin
I thought when I first tried meth it all
then all that soft but it'll be fine my
skin did not like these at all so I
bought two packs and I haven't actually
opened a second while I'm gonna use them
for my nails instead and go back to my
boots ones which are just so much softer
and nicer to use and yeah I was just a
bit disappointed that I didn't think
there'd be any different but they really
were my last two hits are non beauty
related first of all MARY POPPINS by PL
travers this is so random but I saw
saving mr. banks the film like a month
ago and I absolutely loved it I never
really knew the story behind Mary
Poppins which was one of my favorite
films and I was younger I didn't really
know the story so I love finding out the
backstory and after seeing the film I
was like I have to read the original
book because it's obviously so different
to the film that Disney created so I've
been reading this is
fighting is like a kids book it's
actually harder than you think I know I
sound like a moron but like kids
imaginations are so wild you have to
kind of I'm so used to like thinking oh
that would never happen in real life I
have to kind of think outside the box a
bit but it's really a kind of light
enjoyable read at night so it's quite
nice childhood memories reading this
I've also been absolutely loving
Breaking Bad me rich and my mum have
been watching it on netflix and we are
on the last season I think we've got
about 10 episodes to go until the end so
no one comment don't tell me anything
about what happens I'll freak out but
it's amazing we caught we literally
watch like three or four episodes at a
time it's so addictive it's amazing if
you haven't watched breaking bad and if
you're kind of over 16 I'd say then you
definitely should I'd really recommend
it it's about like a chemistry teacher
that gets into creating like making
drugs sounds awful but it's so good it's
really addictive to watch and just so
well written and so well cast and I'm
obsessed I can't wait to finish it but
then I know I'll be sad when I do as
well so that's everything from my
January hits and misses I hope you like
seeing the products that I've loved and
the products that I've been disappointed
in as well don't forget to leave me your
question and comment on this video and
then hopefully I can film that Q&amp;amp;A video
for you guys to go up next week thanks
so much for watching and I'll see you in
my next video bye hi guys for today's
video I'm going to be doing a drugstore
makeup tutorial or a back-to-school look
if you are in school I really hope you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
