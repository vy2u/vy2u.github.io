favorites video for july I can't believe
July's over already I actually think
this month has gone the quickest this
year by far and sorry if you hear any
background noise I have to have all the
windows open in my room because I'm in
the loft and it's boiling hot so yeah
windows open so if you hear birds and
lawnmowers and all that jazz and I'm
going to start I've got all my monthly
favorites here and there's not loads
there wasn't really anything that stood
out to me this month but there's a few
things I've sort of been enjoying the
future of random things as well so I'm
going to start with this which is a
haircare product it's from unite and
it's the seven seconds condition leave
in detangler I heard about this from
Fleur she always raves about it and I
know it's quite hard to get hold of and
you can get it loads places in America
but it's hard to get hold of here in the
UK but when I look into online I wasn't
really that bothered by getting it but
then I looked online and there was a
hairdressers in central London which is
quite easy for me to get to that stocks
it so I went there it's the most random
tiny little hairdresser you'll ever find
but they were really lovely people in
there and I also if they had it there
with the stock room and they had one and
I told them I happy I was and how I
probably right about on my blog and I
was so happy they said all we must stuck
up just in case people come to get it
they were really sweet so um I'll put
the details of that hairdresser below
because I think they're the only place
you can get it in London really and you
under the product it's a spray tan list
I use it when i'm having my hair
straight not curly because i don't
really brush my hair once i get out the
shower when it's curly so I wash my hair
and get out the shower and I spray quite
a generous amount of this in my hair and
then it literally makes brushing the
easiest thing ever my hair but just
glides through my hair and and it smells
really nice smells really like frooties
has a bit like the origins mask that I'm
obsessed with that overnight mask yeah
it's really good so it's just really
nice to tangle it its heat protector UV
ray protects and all of that
so I really recommend this if you can
get your hands on it and i'll definitely
be repurchasing this when i run out and
have a couple of perfumes that i've been
loving this month first one is jo malone
wild blue bell and i got this in the
sort of small size because quite summary
perfumes i thought it would last me the
summer and then I'll decide if I wanted
another one or if I prefer to get sort
of a more autumn esent which is what I
really like about these size that some
30 mil I think yeah 30ml am really good
I just literally keep it my hand like
the whole time so this one's called wild
blue bell it smells really good like
there's no way I'm going to be able to
describe the smell but it's very summery
and light and it's kind of floral but I
don't like floral scents so I like this
one because it's a bit different it's
been more interesting not too girly so
go and have a sniff if you'd like to
know what wild blue bar smells like
because I'm not going to be able to
describe it to you I don't even know if
it smells like blue bells either nobody
else more like and here the next one is
from cordially and this is the flared of
vine I don't know if I said that right
but this is part of there's three
perfumes and they're all based on
different stages of a grape in a
vineyard and the green stage there's a
sort of Moroni red and a yellow and
they're all really nice this is really
fresh I really like this as kind of
users like a body mist and in the summer
it's just a really nice summary really
light fragrance and with a pretty bottle
as well designed to look like grape
vines really nice actually and I don't
think most people think they go to
cordially for perfumes so i'd recommend
going to try these up because yeah
they're really good for the summer while
we still have a summer I've also been
using tinted moisturizer a lot this
month in particular the laura mercier
tinted moisturizer I've had this for
years I mean I've had another one and I
repurchased it I've been using this for
years and i really like i used to use my
hands to apply it and now i've been
using the Real Techniques buffing brush
and I do like it a bit more flawless but
more coverage and wearing it now
actually and I really like the sort of
actual effect that it gives it's really
easy to put on its really moisturizing
the color I've got is bisque and I think
it's a little bit dark for me actually
but it's okay in the summer I guess
because sort of hands up my face a bit
and but I think next time i probably
have to get a lighter shade so yeah it's
got SPF 20 and i'd recommend that if
you're looking for it into moisturizer
they've also been loving my new ray
bands that i got about month ago or a
few weeks there was no reason it was a
random decision to go and buy new
sunglasses i didn't need them at all I
was just getting a bit bored of my other
ones because they had a red bit on the
side and so I had to make them they
didn't always go with everything I
wanted to wear so these are a new model
and I like no because they look a bit
like the wafers but I've tried annoyed
for her so many times and they just
don't suit me I think they're just the
rim of the glasses is just too heavy for
my face because I got quite a small face
and so these are still a nice and fake
and similar shape but they just had a
white basically better so i'll show you
those that's what they look like and i
really like them actually and they're
about 110 pounds which I don't mix trial
at all for sunglasses so that even if I
change my mind in a year or so and don't
like them anymore it's not the end of
the world because I haven't spent
hundreds and hundreds on them and so
yeah I really like those and I've been
wearing this every day in the Sun and
I've also been using my favorite summer
blusher a lot this month which is
benefits coralista if it interests
everyone's favorite coral blusher I love
it and this is still in the old
packaging which I like so I can swirl
the brush around in the lid and it just
looks like this it's a lovely lovely
coral with a bit of shimmer and it
smells amazing um I feel like I've he's
quite a lot of this actually I don't
know when the bottoms gonna appear I've
never finished a benefit blush or
bronzer before but I really love this if
you haven't tried it before I really
recommend going to try it because it's a
perfect blush for the summer um I've
also been loving this lipstick which
I've already spoken about so it goes too
much detail but it's the deal lipstick
in 353 blush and it's just a really
lovely every day nude color oh it's
actually going a bit melted
I see any problem with these curved
lipsticks but really nice and really
easy to wear and just makes my lips look
really good so I've been using this a
lot the next one's a bit random but I
Reese you went to illamasqua to try
their makeup school and it just got me
wanted to use all my illamasqua products
again so I've been using the ceiling gel
and the ceiling gel is basically so you
can wet by shadows and use them wet it's
just comes in this little thing any blob
a bit onto your eyeshadow and then it
makes a wet and it dries really quickly
so it doesn't actually make them really
wet you have to use it quite quickly but
it means that you can apply that I
shadow really nice and wet on your
eyelid and it gives a really nice effect
the final product is this I've reviewed
it on my blog I don't know how to
pronounce it either Mick hell Mercier or
Michelle or Michael I don't know but
I'll link to my blog post and it's a
brush a bit like the tangle teezer but
so much better it's got a handle it
comes in three different types of
brushes for thin hair medium and thick
this is the thick one and it's really
good the bristles all different sizes it
gets through all my hair really easily
whereas the tangle teezer only sort of
brush the top layers of my hair so I've
been loving using this um sorry it's
kind of covered in here but yeah I use
this in the shower and it's working
really really well and it's stopping any
breakages in my hair and making my hair
feel really good and I'm trying to stop
my half and breaking because it's really
broken and split at the bottom so this
is perfect and I really love it and I'd
recommend getting it you can order them
online and it looks kind of cool too
nice for the summer put your beach bag
and so that's all my favorites this
month and i hope you enjoyed seeing them
put your monthly favorites below if
you'd like and thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
