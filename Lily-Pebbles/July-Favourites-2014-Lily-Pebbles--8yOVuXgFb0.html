my July favorites and these are my
absolute favorite videos to film I
always get really excited to just sit
down and talk through my favorite
products from the month so I'm gonna get
started and I think I'm gonna start with
hair this is a new launch phone Bumble
and Bumble i absolutely love Bombala
normal products I'm hardly ever really
disappointed this is an extension of
their invisible oil range they had like
just the invisible oil which is a really
nice lightweight oil and they've added a
shampoo conditioner and a primer shampoo
I didn't love I thought it was a bit
heavy ironically it's meant to be kind
of lightweight the conditioner i really
liked but the star of the show was
definitely the heat UV protective primer
so this is a spray it's quite a big bust
allegedly and you just spritz this all
over your hair when it's damn i think
you can use it when it's dry as well but
it's quite a wet spray so i wouldn't be
able to do that because it would just
make my hair go curly but you spray all
over your hair before you blow dry or
straighten it and it protects the hair
from heat and it's also really good to
tangler so you put it on wet hair when
you come out the shower it makes it
easier to brush through it's not as
amazing at the tangling as my united
seven seconds to tangler but using this
with the wet brush which is my all-time
favorite hairbrush and really works to
help to get through all the knots so
i've been loving this and it smells
amazing as well oh so delicious I've
also been loving these hair bands that I
picked up from boots they find the brand
scrunchie I don't really know how to
pronounce it it's got like a one of
those funny use that I don't really know
what that means when there has two dots
over these are no-slip grip so they're
kind of a funny like silicone texture
and I find they don't break a lot the
time hair bands like break which is
really annoying there's no end to them
so it doesn't kind of kink the hair they
grip really well to the hair so if you
find your hair bands slip out of your
ponytail these be really good for you I
actually gave some to Anna because she
always complains about her hair band
falling out because they are Griffey
they can slightly pull on the hair so
you have to be careful when you take
them out but for me it's long as you're
careful I think it's worth it to have a
really good hair bad that you can also
put around your wrist and it doesn't
look too much like a hair band okay now
on to skincare and the first thing is
this I makeup remover form the body shop
it's part of their camera mile range I
really like the caramel cleansing oil is
most amazing product for takeoff makeup
but this is really good for removing eye
makeup and I actually struggled to find
good eye makeup removers i love the
clarins one but it is pricey and I've
tried a lot of drug store ones that I
haven't been that happy with but this
one's really amazing it's not quite as
good as the Clarins one you need kind of
a few extra swipes but it's it's nearly
as good it really is and it's so much
more affordable it's kind of the same
it's like split into two so it's like an
oil consistency so it really gets rid of
that kind of waterproof mascara really
affordable really gentle on the eyes and
I've been using all of this I love it
I've also been obsessed with my sarah
chapman intense hydrating booster serum
i've been using this every morning and
most nights sometimes i use their as
they lured advanced night repair in
evening this is more of a morning serum
for me because it really adds that like
boost of hydration that i need under my
makeup so things that start to look dry
and dehydrated throughout the day it
comes in this really easy packaging so
you only need a couple of drops it's one
of those serums it really spreads around
your face really easy it's not sticky at
all I actually really went off hydrol
Iran I use it for ages but then it's
Arthur just feel a little bit too sticky
for me and I think this feels much nicer
on the skins a lot more expensive but I
think it's worth it if you're going to
invest in your skincare i think serum is
definitely the thing to invest in and
get a drugstore moisturizer now on to
makeup and i have a few makeup items and
a few makeup tools as well the first one
is this brush cleaner and i mentioned
this in my Liberty boots haul video I
bought this in Liberty beauty haul and
it's the goat milk brush shampoo I was
really excited to try this or so with a
label on it it was 16 pounds you just
screw the lid off and you wet your brush
and you wet this and then you swallow a
brush in it and then you just watch this
under the sink and it goes back to being
clean and I was really surprised at how
quickly it made my brushes clean
normally I used dr. bronner's soap and i
put on my hand and I have to swirl it
around for a while keep rinsing keep
swirling keep rinsing but this was
literally a case of like swirl rinse and
it was clean it also made my brushes
feel so soft which is what I was hoping
it would do because of the goat milk and
I was really impressed I think this is
great for it's like an in-between spot
cleaning and deep cleaning because deep
cleaning I feel like is a longer process
they take a lot longer to dry because
you're putting them under the tap but
spot cleaning can dry out your brushes
so this is a really good in between I
now spoken about this product a lot
past few videos but how could I not
mention it in my monthly favorites its
the Tom Ford I defining pen this is the
liquid liner and I've been using this
pretty much every day this month I've
got more part of today that always
happens i'm wearing charlotte tilbury
eyeliner today but i have just become
obsessed with wearing black eyeliner
again and this is my favorite one I do
like the Revlon one and I do like the
soap &amp;amp; Glory one for drug stores but for
high-end this is definitely the best one
I've tried it's double ended but I don't
actually use the small end because I
find it's just a little bit too small
but the long end is perfect for that
really easy black liquid line and it's
just it's weighted as well but like
their mascaras if you can see you
probably can't see if it's kind of
waited so it's really easy to hold in
your hand another makeup item that I've
been wearing most days this month and I
haven't actually spoken about it i don't
know why i have been wearing it loads
it's the YSL I quad in it's one of their
coach ear I cod pallets in number two I
don't think it says what shade is its
number two it looks like this and it's
just got really nice combination of
shades it's got a highlighting shade a
light brown and medium brown a darker
Brown and then a kind of grey tone that
you can use for an eyeliner and the
quality of YSL I shadows are amazing
it's just a really cute little cordon
it's kind of it's one of those it hasn't
got any shades in it that I wouldn't
wear and I've been wearing it all
they're really soft and buttery and it's
a very small compact palette so I've
been loving that I think these pallets
are new to wire cell final favorite is
something I picked up in the sale
recently and it's from whistles this was
half price and I've seen that this are
still some in a few stores I was so
excited when I found this it's a makeup
bag I really don't need any more makeup
bags but I'm obsessed with my makeup
bags they're definitely my thing so on
the back it's just plain black leather
and then on the front it's the soft
linen e material type thing in a really
bright coral and then the top is leather
and says whistles it's really nice and
big it's still got the stuff it in there
you can fit a lot in and it's just so
cute and for a leather makeup bag that
was half price I thought this was a
really good find and I'm excited to use
it although I don't know when I will
because I never leave my house with
makeup but I love makeup bags so those
are my favorites from July comment down
below in

favorite has been this month thank you
