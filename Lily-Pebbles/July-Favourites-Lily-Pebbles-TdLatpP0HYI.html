forget to watch to the end of the video
because I've got a little announcement
about some videos that are going up next
week hi today I'm going to be filming my
July favorites which is my favorite time
of the month I love talking through my
favorite products it's absolutely
boiling in London in the UK in general
my hair is going to be so curly and
frizzy by the end of this I literally
cannot breathe but I wanted to film this
today so I'm just going to attempt some
kind of sweaty July favorites video
anyway so talking about the heat the
first product is something I've been
using on my hair and because it is so
hot I've been really not wanting to blow
dry my hair I have to straighten it but
to blow dry it first just means more
heat and it's just far too hot for that
so i've been using the paul mitchell
super skinny serum on damp hair and if
you put this through your damp it really
helps your hair dry it much quicker
literally it takes about 10 minutes for
my hair to dry once I put the song which
is crazy because I have a lot of hair
and it normally takes ages so it's
really nice also helps just kind of
smooth it out and make straightening
easy as good if you have dry hair just
conditions that ends as just really nice
and I've been enjoying using this it's a
huge bottle so I don't think I'll be
going through it anytime soon the next
product is also summer related and it's
the clinic self Sun body tinted lotion
and I've been using this mainly just on
my legs but i have used on my arms as
well it's a tinted lotion so it comes
out brown and it tints your skin but
it's also a gradual tanner so it kind of
does the best of both really and I
really like it I have the shade light to
medium and I probably would like to try
a medium stopped because this is really
light but it does kind of take the edge
off and stop your legs looking to pale
and I've really been enjoying using this
I use a mitt to apply it because it's
just kind of fool proof and then you
won't get any streaks but I haven't had
any streaking problems at this I've
really been enjoying using this and it's
helped with my pasty pale legs next up
is a nail polish and I didn't get to
mention this in my summer nail polish
favorites because I'd only just bought
it then but I've really been loving it
this month and it's se watermelon I did
a blog post with this so I'll link it
below it's just a really pretty bright
summer pink without being too kind of
Barbie ish too girly it's kind of got a
little bit of raspberry in it I just
love this color and I didn't know they
did this color in the diffusion line but
I finally found one in Boots and it's so
much better than the diffusion line
because the brush is wider and
everything so 3799
definitely recommend se watermelon this
month I've been using a lot of long
lasting makeup products because the
weather is so hot and something that's
coming so useful is the Estee Lauder
seller shots or jello shots I'm not
really sure I think never said this out
loud it's siiii llo however you
pronounce that there's basically like a
gel blush it comes in a little pump and
you need the tiniest amount and you
really need to act fast the minute you
put on your chief you have to start
blending all eyes you'll have like a
little stain dot it's quite hard to work
with but if you can figure it out and
just blend really quickly it's amazing
it goes on your cheek like a gel and
then lasts like a stain and it lasts all
day seriously it doesn't move at all no
matter how much you're sweating or
running around or whatever your makeup
doesn't melt off your face and this has
just been amazing i've been using this
most days especially if I'm like out
filming all day or something like that
where I need my makeup to last all day
it's just amazing i love the little kind
of bullet packaging as well and they
come in a few different shades I've got
a pink one as well this one is hot fuse
and it's kind of a ready color and I
really like it it's like a really nice
natural flush color and yeah I think
these are amazing next up is an SPF I'd
be wearing SPF on my face every day this
month because it has been so sunny and
i've been using a few i really like the
keels one i really like the Estee Lauder
one there's a few that i really like 1
i've been loving the most is from Kiko
it's the city filter sunscreen it's SPF
50 and it's also a primer I love this
it's really nice as a prime it's tacky
enough to kind of make your makeup stick
to it but it doesn't feel sticky it
comes out like a yellowy white and it
smells like ice cream so yeah it's
amazing I really like it I like Kiko I
want to try some more stuff from them
I've tried their eye shadow base the
cream eyeshadows and they've really nice
but I've only got purple which isn't
that easy to wear so trying to hunt down
the bronze at the moment but I've been
loving the city filter SPF really
recommend this I know they have a few
stores around London I've seen them in
Westfield and they have a website i'll
see if i can find this online if not
have a look in the stores because i know
that they do do this because anna picked
one up recently so yeah i've been loving
this the final makeup product is
something i bought quite recently from
spacing k and it's from by terry and
it's the highlighting concealer brush
which is the two civility I don't know
if that's how you pronounce it that was
really bad French but this is basically
a concealer it looks a bit like the wire
sell one you click the bottom and then
it comes out of the brush but the brush
is much wider on this I don't like
things that have kind of a brush
applicator I think it's not very good
hygiene but I really wanted to try this
because I've heard great things I think
Anna's a big fan of this I've heard a
few other people talking about it so I
went to get one I got the shade shades
that I get to and that suits me
perfectly it's slightly lighter than my
skin tone by quite like that for kind of
under eye and brightening it's really
strange when you kind of put it on your
skin you think it's going to be really
sheer but then I use a separate brush to
blend it out and once you start blending
it kind of the coverage like builds up
so it's actually more coverage than you
think it's going to be it's sometimes a
little bit too sheer for my under eyes
when I have really dark circles but it's
perfect for like round my nose and my
chin and for brightening and I area I
really like this the brush I'm not so
keen on the whole brush thing but I
really like the formula and it smells
really nice which is a bonus so I'd
really recommend this one kind of non
favorite for this month is my bioderma
with a pump I have been looking for this
thing for years literally whenever I'm
in France I looking all the pharmacies
for one with a pump so looks like this
you open it and then it's bit like when
you have your nails done and at salon
and they you pump the cotton wool on
there in the biodome it just comes out I
look for this everywhere and John Pelham
Croydon in London which is a nice
pharmacy they started selling it so I
bought one online very excited and I'm
really disappointed I don't like the
pumper tool is really hard to get enough
product out and when you pump it kind of
squirts everywhere it kind of goes out
the sides and you end up making a big
mess and wasting a lot of products I've
gone through quite a lot already more
than I normally do so I won't be
repurchasing a pump I'm going to go back
to the normal bottles but I'm glad I
tried it if any of you like me who are
desperately it has on a pump they're not
that great they're a bit annoying really
so just thought I'd let you know and
then my final favorite is a random one
but it's a drink I've been loving all
month and I actually saw this drink
advertised on my own blog and then I
went out and I saw it and I was like oh
I want to try that it's the new
pineapple and passionfruit ribena and oh
my
this stuff is so good it just tastes
like summer in a bottle I this one's
empty because I've been drinking it
throughout this video it just smells
like it is more passion fruity than
pineapple it's just delicious it's like
the best juice ever my zoom icon fungo
when I was a child I really like this
I've been buying them in bulk every time
I go to the shop and yeah really yummy
so i'm glad i saw that advert on my own
blog so thanks for watching I hope you
