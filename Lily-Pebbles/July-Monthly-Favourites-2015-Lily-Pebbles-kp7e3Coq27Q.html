July favorites and as you guys know I
just got back from LA so I have a kind
of mixed a bunch of favorites a lot of
non beauty stuff because I kind of used
the same beauty stuff all month really
but I have a lot of lifestyle favorites
as well and I've got them all written
down in my cute little marble notepad I
got in LA and I'm a bit obsessed with
this so let me open this up and I'm
gonna start with a tv-show favourite now
when that entourage film came out
recently all my friends once we go see
it but I didn't want to see it because I
hadn't ever watched the TV show I don't
know why I never go into it when it
first came out but I just didn't so I
said let me try and watch it first
before we see the film and then I
literally watched eight seasons in about
a month me and rich downloaded all eight
seasons shaking they were on sky and we
literally just like went through the
whole thing I became completely addicted
I'm now an expert on entourage I really
really enjoyed it I was driving and a
completely mad in LA referring to it
like on a daily basis so if you never
got into entourage originally it's so
good it's about up-and-coming actor and
his group of friends and that's kind of
what it's about it's one of his friends
his manager his agents in it another one
of his friends is his driver and it's
just so good it's really like LA life
it's a good little insight into like the
film industry and I absolutely loved it
so I haven't seen the film yet
I heard it's not that great but I think
if you like the TV series and the films
meant to be good so I'm looking forward
to seeing that okay so now for a beauty
favorite and it's backwards hair washing
now Oshun ages ago pull out a co washing
products which I think if I remember
correctly was about just conditioning
your hair and not shampooing it I think
it was something like that but Karis
that's recently brought out this range
which is I actually don't know what it's
called
I'll find out a link it below but it
looks like this and the idea is that you
condition your hair first and then
shampoo it this is aimed at people who
have thin or actually fine hair and what
I mean by fine hair because obviously
I've got big frizzy hair so it doesn't
look fine is that although I have lots
of hair the actual hairs are quite fine
and you can kind of tell what sort of
hair you have by feeling it if it's got
like a really hard strong texture then
you've got thick hair but you can kind
of feel if you've got fine hair and I do
so
the actual hairs are thin although I
have a lot of it and the idea behind
this is that you condition first to
protect the hair it kind of wraps this
stuff around the hair before you start
shampooing it because that can really
damage fine brittle hair and break the
hair and I love this because I feel like
I leave the shower and my hair feels
really clean I can't actually use these
particular ones anymore because they're
not sulfate free and when you get a
Brazilian blow-dry you have to use
sulfate free products just to kind of
keep it in your hair for longer if you
sulfate products then it strips out the
Brazilian treatment so I don't use these
ones anymore but I'm still doing the
whole condition and then shampoo thing
with myself a free products and it
really works it seems so bizarre to put
conditioner on dirty hair but I put the
conditioner on leave it on for a bit and
then shampoo and my hair feels so clean
and in such good condition so I'm loving
the whole backwards washing thing and
I'm going to continue doing that for as
long as it works for me okay next up is
another beauty product and how could I
not include this in my monthly favorites
if you don't know Jacqueline Hill
already she is a beauty youtuber she
lives in America she's absolutely
hilarious she has like the biggest
personality ever Anna introduced me to
her channel and I think at first I
wasn't a massive fan I wasn't sure if it
was for me but I'm completely addicted
now and her makeup tutorials are amazing
I wouldn't necessarily wear all of the
looks but I love watching her apply the
makeup and she's really great at it she
recently collaborated with Becca
cosmetics which I already love Becca
it's an Australian brand really nice
products and she created her in
highlighter she's very well known for
her highlighter and it's called
champagne pop it looks like this
I was desperate to get hold of this it
was on Sephora calm and I ordered two I
don't know why I panicked I just thought
if I love it it's like a limited edition
so I've got like a spare one in my
drawer it's like a golden peach
highlighter well what I love about this
is that you can instantly see it when
you put it on I don't if you can see it
on now I've put on a little bit but some
highlights as a feel that you can't
really see this is really intense so
it's not particularly good for during
the day although I do wear it because I
like it but it's great for the evening
and when you do want like a strong
highlight it's just so beautiful I think
she's done really well I know a lot of
people have ordered them online and
they've come smashed which is a shame I
think it's because the formulas just so
soft
but luckily both of mine came all right
I absolutely have loved using it a
ticket away with me and I'm obsessed
another beauty product that I know won't
come as a surprise because I've
mentioned this in so many videos already
is the YSL cream bronzer I am using a
shade too although all the shades are
quite similar but this is basically a
cream bronzer I used it in a tutorial
recently which I will link below and
it's beautiful I think it's only really
good for the summer or if you live in a
warm country because it's very dewy and
creamy but it's so nice just to apply to
the tops of the cheekbones and the
temples Daniel knows it gives you a
really natural sunkissed look and it
really kind of blends into the skin and
plumps up your skin and makes it look
very fresh I have used so much of this
already there's a huge dent in it and
it's it's not something I ever would
have thought that I'd like but I really
have enjoyed using this again I took it
away with me and it's a great product so
I would highly recommend this one next
up are some shoes and these are from
office well I've put that far too close
to my face they're really dirty
underneath these are from office I just
randomly picked them off I went in so
then they look good tried them on and I
was like these are the comfiest things
ever they literally feel like you're
walking on clouds I must admit though
after a whole day of wearing them they
get a little bit tight for me around
here but they are so comfortable I
bought them in black and I bought them
in nude I instagrammed them I tweeted
them I've been raving about these
because they are so so comfy they go
with everything I just I really like the
style of this like crossover I just
don't know like I've never had sandals
like this and I really like them they've
got a slight little wedge which means
that you kind of stand with a better
posture they look good with jeans shorts
dresses skirts everything I Willis to
death in LA I definitely won the black
ones more than I've worn the nude ones I
probably didn't need both but I do like
the nude ones as well they're a bit more
sophisticated and I think they were like
40 pounds but they really work
completely worth it I love these well
I'm so sorry about this bit of hair like
what is that I can't get rid of it in
this video sleep a little bit insane
okay more beauty and before my face this
month I have loved mixing two products
together this isn't a new thing I've
used in tutorials but I just still love
it so I thought I'd mention it again
it's the Estee Lauder CC cream which
I've nearly finished and the NARS sheer
glow which I use in Deauville by the way
the whole like NARS sheer glow not
having a lid thing I found
Terry lid from another foundation that
fit song so I've been using that I know
that it locks but when you travel it
always unlocks and leaks everywhere so
I've just been using the by Terry lid I
really love this SLO de BB cream because
it just adds a hint of warmth to your
skin but I find that it's not that easy
to spread it around the skin so don't
love using it by itself what I like to
do is mix it with my foundation so I put
squirts of the BB cream squirt
foundation and then I kind of dab it on
my finger and blend it all together and
it makes the foundation a bit more
lighter and dewy
the BB cream adds a bit of warmth to the
foundation it's just like a beautiful
mix I've just been loving using these
all month I always like to take a couple
of by Terry Umbra black star eyeshadow
sticks away with me but as well as those
I made myself a little Mac quad and I
think I've done a blog post on this
because I always end up taking these
four shadows away with me and it really
is the perfect quad
they are my favorite for Mac eyeshadows
this one is patina which is a light gold
this one is all the glitters which is
like a light shimmery pink this one is
cork which is a really nice matte warm
brown and then this one is hoax which is
like matte light plum these two are use
for the crease and under the eye these
two I use for all over the lid and they
are perfect I love this cord they're
perfect for one more beauty favorites
and it's the Urban Decay setting spray
in all nighter I have unless you tried
any of the others so I might like those
as well this is the travel size that I
took away with me and I just love this
out of all the setting sprays I have
this is my favorite one because it's
cool lame it kind of meshes all your
makeup into your skin and it also sets
it in place I hardly ever miss this step
popping today see if you can tell the
difference this is me now this is me
after you probably can't see on camera
but I feel like it just adds jus Innis
the skin I've said that so much in this
video but it kind of just binds all your
makeup together sets in place it's
really nice when you were in a warm
country and just lovely in the summer my
final favorite is VidCon is such a good
time we weren't sure whether to go or
not we didn't go last year cuz we didn't
really think it was our time and we
decided to just go this year we booked
our flights and hotel and just went for
it and I had the best time it's not
necessarily where my viewers are because
I feel like there's quite a lot of
younger viewers at VidCon but for me it
was amazing to just be a part of the
industry see some panels and meet some
other YouTube
I made so many new friends and really
enjoyed getting to know other youtubers
outside of the kind of UK beauty space
because obviously it's quite a little
like bubble over here and it's nice to
meet people that do two completely
different things on YouTube it was
really inspiring and I had a great time
and I had such a good week with Anna in
LA so VidCon is definitely one of my
favorites this month so that everything
I've been loving this month I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and please leave
a comment down below telling me what
your favorites are this month because I
always like to know and yeah it's July
it's halfway through the year that's
absolutely crazy I can't believe in like
six months time I'm going to be doing my
2015 favorites that is mad thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you guys
on Tuesday for another weekly vlog bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
