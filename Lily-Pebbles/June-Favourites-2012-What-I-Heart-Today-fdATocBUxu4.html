favorites video for june and I've got
quite a nice little collection of things
this month and I'm a lot of things like
towards the end of may I started really
liking so I added to my own list and
yeah I'll start going through all the
products I've loved this month so the
first thing you would have seen in my
French pharmacy hall and it's the
bioderma high jabot Legere and
moisturizers a light cream moisturizer
for sensitive skin and I really like
this it's really sort of thin in quite
watery which I wouldn't normally think
that I would like in a moisturizer it's
a bit like the quarterly serum if you've
tried it but it's really nice in the
morning under your makeup but just it's
really refreshing I'm really lightly
scented and just yeah just really like
it and i've been using this off every
day since i got it so the first two
weeks of the month i've been loving one
sort foundation and the second two weeks
i've been loving another so i thought
i'd put them both in because i really
like them both counsel equally and the
first one is the latane touché éclat
new YSL foundation so this is the
foundation to go with the two shukla
concealer and I absolutely love this and
i use shade be 40 but be 30 also works
me this is just like a little bit darker
and for the summer but it's just a
really really nice foundation I use my
hands to apply it and it literally just
like melts onto my skin they use a gel
instead of a powder and you can really
feel the difference in the texture to a
normal foundation and I also really love
the packaging sin this nice glass bottle
with gold lid and it has a pump already
on it and I've just been loving this so
I use this when I want to like a proper
foundation but the rest of the time I
have been loving the dr jart BB cream I
did a blog post on all the BB creams
that dr. Jeff just bought out in the UK
and boots so I'll link that below and
they are just amazing my favorite one is
the one for older skin which is weird
it's not the one that's aimed at me a
tool but I like it the best and it gives
really nice coverage it's really
moisturizes the skin
makes me look glowing and yeah it's just
so easy to use where I pie with my hands
and it goes on a little bit a little bit
gory be the Queen's are known to like
adapt to your skin color um but it
really does adapt and then just looks
amazing on I'm actually wearing it today
I don't know if you can kind of see but
it just looks like foundation so the
fact that it sort of helps your skin as
well and it's good for your skin I try
to use this over foundation when I can
so these 2 i've just been taking turns
using both of them and absolutely love
them both it would highly recommend to
go to try them so this one or i sell i
think they've actually started giving
out samples and selfridges now but think
it's coming out around the fifth of july
and the dr jart BB creams and now out in
selected boots stores are they like
around 20 to 25 pounds and this was
actually think it's like 28 pounds and
really not that expensive so those are
very good um lip products you would have
also seen this in my french pharmacy
hall it's the nooks reve de miel lip
balm I've talked about the one in the
pot this is the one in stick form and no
it's not as good as the one in the pot
but I have really been enjoying it I
like to use lip balm leg on the
cheeburger a tube and I still use my
hand sanitizer my hand cream and lip
balm and sometimes it's nicer just to
use one in a stick and it's really sort
of easy and yeah just I really like it
so like I've seen these loads of
pharmacies in the UK so you can get them
for like four three or four pounds i
think um and it's really nice and handy
to keep in my bag so i'm actually glad
my mom got me two of those in the end
the second thing i got in the airport
when I was going to Berlin and it's the
Clarins incident like natural lip
Perfector I saw este from st busted
essiebutton talking about this and so I
thought I'd give it a go when I was in
the store and it seemed really nice I
don't really let wear lip glosses that
often and so it's like bit different for
me but I love it it's kind of like a lip
gloss that feels a little bit like a lip
balm as well and so it's in a tube and
it has like one of those funny foam
applicator
that when you squeeze it you can see the
product come out actually makes me feel
really sick can't look at it when I
squeeze it but it's really nice to apply
and just leaves a really nice of glossy
finish and this is the color 02 which is
yeah just a 02 hasn't got a name
anything there's a really nice sort of
peachy pink and I just love it so I'm
going to get through this pretty quickly
I think and next is this pretty random
it's a tattoo cream I recently got a new
tattoo you've probably seen it in my
other videos is here you can kind of see
it says new kid in town and i'll
probably do a blog post on it explaining
those people if you asking me but yeah
that's what it looks like and i've been
using this tattoo cream tattoo
appointment on it for a couple of weeks
i actually bought this from the place i
got it done which was the family
business in exmouth market in london and
they saw their own cream and I've always
sort of struggled to find a cream i
really like I've got four tattoos and I
think a couple of them i use the panthan
which a lot of people use but then some
people say you shouldn't use that
because it's too greasy it's like meant
for nappy cream normally and the other
time I use a kunai go in LA because I
got my tattoo down there and it was like
a really nice watery that's my favorite
one I've used but I can't find it here
it's like an American product so i
thought i'd give this a go because they
recommended it and i've really liked it
i obviously haven't used much and it's
practically healed so i'm probably going
to give this to my brother and all you
just got a tattoo done and but yeah I
really like it's not too greasy and it
just made specifically for tattoo
healing so like what more could you want
I just think this is really good so even
if you don't get your tattoo done there
maybe go to the family business and buy
this if you're looking for a good
aftercare cream for your tattoo another
thing i've also been loving this month
is my new bar dymond seal and shine top
coats and i don't really talk about like
my top coats and base coats that margin
people always ask me so i'll show you
like my favorite one it used to be the
Seche vite but when i discovered new bar
and tried this one this is now when
your favor I absolutely love it I'm so
pathway through it about the point where
you're kind of struggling to get your
brush in the product but it's really
good it just applies really nicely makes
my nail polish last for like four to
five days and yea big new ball fan and
that's a good top coat so I think you
can get new bar from Beauty Bay which is
a website I try and find out and link it
below and they've got some really lovely
colors as well the last two things are
hay fever related the first one is this
Mac eyeliner you're probably thinking of
what is eyeliner got to do with hay
fever but this is the eyeliner in NC 15
and w 20 and it's a cream eyeliner and
I've had the most horrendous hay fever
this month and I have get really swollen
eyes and I wake up in the morning and I
just have swollen red bloodshot eyes and
being able to put like a cream-colored
iron on it just in the inside my
waterline just makes such a difference
it makes me look a bit more human and
not like some kind of vampire so I've
just been really liking that had this
for ages and I just go through phases of
using it and then I forget about it but
I've been using that a lot here I got
this in one of the collections ages ago
but they do sort of bring them out every
now and again so look out for them it's
a good way to sort of make you look more
awake as well and i've also been using
benadryl plus i know those people suffer
from hay fever so thought I'd quickly
talk about it because I've suffered from
it since I was about 18 I got it just as
I was leaving school I've never been
allergic to anything in my life and I
get really really bad hay fever and I've
been getting the injection every year
for seven years and which is not good
it's a steroid injection but the only
risks really where the steroid
injections that suppresses any sort of
illnesses so if I do get some kind of
horrendous disease within the next two
months I probably won't know about it
but I'm young and healthy so I think the
risk is quite low so I have been getting
the injection and for those of you who
are asking it's called kenalog I did get
it from a private doctor cost me twenty
eight pounds um I think you can't get
from the GP but I'm not one hundred
percent sure I know they're a bit more
weird about I mean I have a GP and a
private doctor for reasons so I can get
things like hey
your injections because it's horrendous
and I just can't sleep and it's not
worth it so I did get it this month
before that I was using a benadryl plus
and these are the best ones I probably
use so far I've tried every hay fever
pill around and these I should do work
and you can take three a day most hay
fever pose you can only take one a day
so it's good that you can take more and
so I'd recommend getting those if you
are suffering from hay fever and you
can't or don't want to get the injection
these are the second best thing so that
was a bit random a hay fever rant there
but if I been asking about it on Twitter
so I thought I just tell you about it
and that's everything for my monthly
favorites oh no I have one more thing
the last thing which probably can be
mentioned in my whole video as well and
is a turban it's really really weird I
went to the M&amp;amp;S BTW whole launch for the
one in Westfield Stratford and they have
this cute little section where they sell
their own like cotton wool and bathroom
things and they have this sort of like
hair turban thing so I mean I have a lot
of hair I get quite stressed with it
when I get out the shower so I thought
I'd buy it it's basically you like put
it over your head like that and then
twist this spit and then like pull it
back so you end up with like a towel
turban on your head and I thought it's a
bit gimmicky but I've tried it it's
actually amazing like when I get out the
shower and I want to sort of town or
moisturize or put mascot it's just a
really nice whiskey will your hair out
of your face I actually love it I bought
it thinking if I don't like I'll give it
to my mom but I'm definitely keeping it
and she wants one so I'm gonna have to
go and get another one it was like five
pounds and I absolutely love it i've
been wearing it every day my boyfriend
thinks I'm mental walking around with
this on my head but I love it so yeah
that's everything I hope you've enjoyed
my monthly favorites video I hope you've
enjoyed my monthly favorites video and
