my June favorites and talk you through
my favourite products from the month so
as most of you will know if you watched
my protect your skin video I had quite a
few moles removed off my body recently
so after they completely healed up I
wanted to use some products to help with
the scarring I scale quite badly and I'm
going a holiday in summer so I wanted to
try and help the kind of healing process
a little bit faster so I've been using
these two products from the brand heel
gel which is a really good brand I've
heard loads about it I've tried their
face serum before that I really liked so
this is the heel gel for body and this
is heel gel intensive so I've been using
the body one first on my scars and then
this one on top and I've been doing that
every morning and every evening now I
have seen an improvement in the scarring
but I don't know if that would have
happened anyway if this has made it
faster but it's definitely healing well
and the scar isn't as bad as it was when
I had moles removed and I was 17 so
maybe these are helping either way it's
a really nice thing to do it feels
really soothing and it's just become
part of my morning and evening routine
the next thing I'm going to briefly talk
about because this is coming up in a
future video is the San Tropez self tan
Express now I went shopping the other
day with Amelia and Anna in Boots and
when that happens it is dangerous we all
ended up picking up different things
enabling each other this is one that
Amelia said was really good she actually
bought two one for her and one for a
friend because her friend was so
desperately trying to get her hands on
it so it's a mousse tan which isn't
something I normally use I normally use
the Zen tan absolute luxe which is a
lotion so that when you apply and then
you kind of go to sleep it it just
develops this one's slightly different
you put the mousse on I use a mitt this
is a cheap one I bought from boots and
then you can weight either one hour two
hours or three hours depending on how
dark you want the tan after that time
you have a shower or wash it off and
then you're clean you feel like you just
have normal skin with no products on it
and the tan keeps developing throughout
the day so I like this because you don't
have to have that kind of tan product
feeling on your skin all day it's a bit
annoying for the kind of two to three
hours that you have it on but because I
work from home I can do it in the
morning have a shower and then the tan
just develops throughout the day but you
can do it early evening as well leave it
on for three hours wash it off go to bed
and you're done the tan is really nice
and golden and
I had no problems with streaking at all
it didn't dry out on me it didn't look
that drastic either I really really like
this and I'm looking forward to trying
it more talking about Amelia the video I
did with Amelia on our budget skincare
pics she actually mentioned this which
is the sanctuary five-minute thermal
detox mask and I had it as well at home
I hadn't tried it yet and she made me
really want to try it and it's a really
nice mask I've been loving it all month
it says it's a deep cleanse facial and I
think that's exactly what it is so it's
like a charcoal mask and you apply it on
your t-zone or on your chin wherever you
feel that you need a bit of a detox and
it's so bizarre heats up and you can
feel it being really warm on your face
but then when you remove it your skin
feels so good I also find this not too
hard to remove but I also find it not
too hard to remove the origins clay mask
I find can be really hard to remove the
end up dragging your skin and my skin oh
is this a bit red afterwards so this is
a really good alternative and it's
pretty affordable you can get it from
Boots still on the subject of skincare
the cleanser I have been obsessed with
all month is the Clarins pure melt
cleansing gel I had a sample of this
years ago from a glossy box and now I
have the full size and it's so good I'm
going through it really quickly so I
don't know if that's an indication of
like how much you get for your money but
I'm going through this cheap very fast
it's a gel consistency but once you
start pumping it into the skin it turns
into an oil so it feels a bit like a
bomb cleanser but it comes in a really
handy tube and not pop and it feels
amazing on the skin you only need a tiny
amount and I put it all over my skin it
takes off all your eye makeup it doesn't
sting your eyes at all I just kind of
rub it into the lashes you end up with
panda eyes but then I just use a muslin
cloth to remove it all and that's kind
of all you need it's like a one-step
cleanser normally I use by derma on my
eyes and then a cleansing balm on my
face but I feel like this is good enough
to use on eyes and face and it's just
kind of one step does it all I
absolutely love this and would
definitely recommend trying it for
makeup I think it's gonna be no surprise
that I'm mentioning the shuttle pre
light Wonder Foundation I've spoken
about this in my last 3 videos I think
is so good it's a gorgeous lightweight
foundation I'm wearing it today it's
kind of like a tinted moisturizer but
then it has a little bit more coverage
so it works like a
I just feel like it makes your skin
really glowing it's really easy to plug
your hands great packaging for traveling
I'd seriously give this about nine out
of ten I can't think of anything that's
wrong with it there's SPF in it so maybe
it wouldn't be good if you're having
flash photos taken of you but I like my
foundations to have SPF in them and yeah
this is probably the perfect foundation
I wear shades three fair and it's a
great match for me the minute I took my
first sniff of this perfume I knew I
would become obsessed it's the Jo Malone
would stage and sea salt Cologne this is
coming out of September so sorry to be
annoying I did get a little bit of a
preview but I didn't want to wait till
then to talk about it because I'm so in
love and I just feel like I need to tell
you guys exactly what my favourites are
so this scent was inspired by the
seaside and it does kind of smell at the
seaside sorry I know it's annoying
people smell perfumes it's really hard
to explain the sender's really fresh and
all my friends have said that it just
smells like something I already wore
like it smells so familiar to me it's
such a me scent and this has become my
new signature scent it's literally shot
the top of my list of perfumes I
absolutely love it and I know I will get
through this whole pourcel look how much
I've used already a month and I will
just keep repurchasing this forever
because it's incredible it's so nice I
have two random favorites this month and
one is food and it's the kiss patchy
recipe I posted on my blog your spatula
is like a cold tomato soup and I got a
lot of comments on my blog post said
it's not the traditional way to make it
and I know it's not I've had to
traditional gazpacho soup as well but
this is a really nice recipe that I
found and it's so easy to make you just
bung all the ingredients into one bowl
keep in the fridge for 24 hours and then
you just kind of like I call it like
you're judging it together I think I
think it's good blending you blend it
all together and that's it it's so easy
to make and it's the nicest kind of cold
summer soup you can put it a shot
glasses or have it in like a normal bowl
and it tastes so delicious it tastes
really garlicky even though it hasn't
got any garlic in it I think it's the
onions and just the combination of all
the different flavors but I've been
obsessed with making this it's so good
my second random favorite is this note
palette and this is from the martha
stewart range at staples
ana got this for ages and I always found
like other notebooks I found like pretty
ones from Liberty's I really liked
because I wasn't so keen on just the
play
black but actually this notepad is
amazing it's slightly wider than your
normal notepad sorry can I just say I'm
really sorry if this is really weird to
talk about a notepad but I'm obsessed
with stationary so if you are too you
will understand why picking a notepad is
so important to me anyway this one is
really wide so has loads of space in it
I've put like little tabs to separate it
so I use this for my work let me show
you it has line pages and it's so wide
but anyway I love this it's just such a
good size so durable and it's made my
life a lot more organized so that's
everything from my June favorites please
