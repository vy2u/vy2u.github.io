monthly favorites from June and I
probably say this a lot but this month
in particular has gone so fast I feel
like I just did my monthly favorites so
it was quite a struggle to collect all
my favorites because I feel like it
hasn't changed that much since last
month but I do have some bits here some
Beauty a bit of food a bit of like non
Beauty other stuff as well so let me
just get my little bot
I've got everything here and I'm just
gonna talk through all the stuff I have
in front of me so the first thing I
showed in my last monthly makeup routine
video and it's a primer from Tom Ford
this is their illuminating primer and I
love this stuff it is pricey but it's
really worth it because it actually
makes such a difference to the skin I
feel like some of these illuminating
primers don't actually look that
different once they're on the skin but
this one I've been using a few different
ways and I love it I either mix it with
some moisturizer and just use it all
over my skin or I'll use a little bit on
the cheekbones and down my nose and this
is kind of a white primer they have just
brought out a new one which is more of
like a rosy tone which I'm now trying
out but I really love this one I've used
quite a lot you can see it's kind of
going up from the bottom I pretty much
use this every day actually at the
moment mixing it with the moisturizer I
just love the glow it gives the skin
perfect this time of year not glittery
or shimmery at all just glowy
yeah I'd say this is probably one of my
favorite Tom Ford products now next up
is another makeup item and this is from
urban decay this is their all nighter
makeup setting spray I do have the large
one somewhere but this is the travel
size that I just keep on my Kirov Beauty
desk and I've been using this when I
finish my makeup just at the end I might
do a lot of spirits now oh it's so nice
it's really refreshing to use but it
also sets your makeup and gives it a bit
of jus eNOS you know sometimes I get
carried away doing my makeup because I
really enjoy doing it and I might add a
bit too much powder or just go a bit too
heavy on the makeup and I feel like a
little spritz of this just kind of takes
everything back a little bit kind of
blends it into the skin better and I
don't know if it makes such a difference
to me and I I don't really ever miss
this step any more when I'm doing my
makeup when I get everyday basis it's
really nice I feel like I haven't got
much left in this one I must get another
travel size okay let's talk about a non
Beauty favourite and I'm very late to
this bandwagon there's cereal podcasts I
think it's a podcast or audio book I
don't really know I've never really got
into them before obviously I
really love the ear biscuit ones and I
was the first podcast I'd ever tried
listening to my phone is ringing really
bad timing
everyone's always talking about how good
cereal is so I thought I'd give it a go
because I really struggle to read books
I used to love reading and when I used
to commune into work I used to try and
read but it just doesn't really fit into
my life at the moment obviously I work
from home so I don't have that commute
and then when I do I find carrying a
book is quite like heavy they don't fit
into any of my bag I had a Kindle that
didn't work out I didn't really enjoy
like reading on a Kindle so I just
haven't read in ages and it's really sad
I only really read on like long beach
holidays so what cereal is is series off
I think it's ten episodes I think
they're making a series - season two now
but the first one I think is like 10
hour long episodes and it's like an
audiobook what I was expecting it's just
be someone reading out a book I thought
that could get quite boring but it's so
much better than that because they've
got like characters and interviews and
they bring in other voices which makes
it really interesting and it's really
exciting the whole ideas they're trying
to solve a murder kind of mystery in
this one and it's really gripping it's
kind of weird to sit on the tube
listening because you don't really know
what to do with your face if something
happens you're like and you can't really
hide it and you do have to really
concentrate I find that if I'm like
claiming my phone I'll just miss what
happened it has to go back so it's quite
good like brain exercise I feel like you
have to really concentrate use your
imagination and I love it and really
enjoying it I'm on I'm only on episode 3
but I'm completely like I listen to it
when I'm doing my makeup now instead of
watching YouTube videos and I love it so
that's why I'm holding my phone it's on
my phone I would really recommend cereal
okay next up is a skincare product and
it's Sunday Riley Luna I think I've
spoken about this in a blog post and in
another video I don't think I've talked
about our video this is a night oil it's
called a sleeping night oil and it's
blue it's got blue tansy in it and
retinol and blue Tansy's what makes it
blue obviously I love this stuff a lot
of people who have acne and scarring say
it is great for healing that and I have
found that when I am spotty I had a big
spots here last week it does kind of
heal that much faster but I also just
love it as a night oil I put like 3
drops on my hand you rub it into the
skin and once all the blue has
disappeared you know you've really
worked it into this
it's not really oily and greasy like
some oils can be it's just really nice
and I kind of give myself a bit of a
facial massage when I'm using it I
pretty much use this every night I
really like it it just really agrees
with my skin it's pricey
I know depends if you want to invest
until your skin care or not but I think
this is great okay another non beauty
here is my little jar of granola I don't
really know whether it's called granola
or like oats or I don't know but I made
this and I'm really proud of myself
because I hate breakfast sorry if that
upsets anyone but I never I never know
what to eat for breakfast like I just
have not found my thing I've been
searching my whole life for the perfect
breakfast and I think I may have found
it these oats basically I made these I
kind of made them up using a few
different recipes and a few products
that I like and looking at the
ingredients and I use these in the
morning and I use them in the evening as
like a little sweet treat dessert
basically what's inside is just ground
almonds jumbo oats maple syrup coconut
oil and a bit of cinnamon it's really
very simple it's very healthy
I mean maple syrup it's sweet but it's
all-natural and I think it's fine it's
not unhealthy you can go but over the
top I think with the healthiness but
it's so so delicious I normally hate
granola and nuts and those kind of
things I find them so bland and boring
to eat these are so delicious
seriously I've made all my friends and
family try it and they're they can't
believe how delicious it is so I've used
it loads of different ways that's what I
love about it you can heat it in so many
different ways I've had it just in a
bowl with almond milk it's like a cereal
or sprinkled on top of fruit or I've
made like apple puree and sprinkle it on
top of that and you can have a breakfast
or you can have that as like a crumble
for dessert I've just had it by itself
there's like an afternoon snack there's
so many different ways you can use this
and it's so so delicious so if you want
me to do a video on how to make these
because I know you guys like my last
kind of cooking video let me know if you
want me to do that I'm not particularly
good at cooking but I kind of that's why
I like to make cooking videos because I
think it's nice to watch someone normal
who's not a pro do things like that so
let me know if you would like that video
okay next up is from soap &amp;amp; Glory this
is the orange Azzam their names are
ridiculous exfoliating body polish this
is an in shower body scrub and
really like this I love the packaging is
very easy to use smells orangey and
zesty which is a type of scent I love in
the shower because it kind of wakes you
up and it's really refreshing and I've
been using this as a scrub
most times most times like every other
shower but especially when I'm tanning
this is quite a scrubby scrub but it's
in like a gel formula so it's also quite
easy to spread around your body if that
makes sense
find a packaging lovely product and yeah
if you see this in your local boots and
Superdrug I'd say pick it up because
it's great and it's huge it will last so
long I am so happy I picked up this
makeup brushes the rmk powder cheek
brush the packaging it's gross but I
want to keep it in there it's just a
little powder brush and it's very
similar to the suku one that Lisa
Eldridge uses all the time the companies
are owned by the same company they're
pretty much sister companies so although
it's much cheaper it's very similar and
it's the perfect size for blusher and
powder and I use it every day I either
use it to set my makeup or I've been
using it with the hourglass ambient
lighting powder on my cheekbones or for
blusher I could just use it for
everything and it's got a really good
little short handle so it's great for
traveling and I love it it's so soft
seriously so soft I love this brush if
you are by Selfridges they sell it there
we can get it online it's great I really
really recommend it next up is a perfume
and this one is actually quite new to me
but I have fallen in love with it I'm
really fussy with perfumes I hate all
those type of perfumes you get in like
beauty halls like standard Beauty was
like Governors has a Fraser
like all the mainstream kind of big
brand perfumes I find them smell so
powdery and sweet and fake in it they
always make me feel a bit like sick so I
love you guys know I love like Joe
Malone Dipti call the very natural
smelling perfumes and I was actually
sent this one it's from a bad brand
called Bella FOID which they sell in
space and Kaylee used to do candles and
now they do perfumes and this is
Ginsberg is God and they have four
different perfumes I think if I'm
correct this one is oh god I really
should have like researched this I'm
gonna link it below it's very earthy and
quite masculine as well let me just
spray some on me it really smells quite
masculine actually I like musky
perfumes and it's different it's not
sweet at all it's quite earthy if you
like fake type perfumes it hasn't I
think it might have figured it's not
doesn't really smell a fake but it
smells of that sort of green earthy
scent well that was hard to describe but
I hope you've got a kind of sense of
what it smells like next time you're in
space okay just give it a sniff I really
like it I love the bottle as well okay
my last favorites of the month are my
braces now you guys might or might not
know that I have braces because I don't
wear them in videos but I do I have
clear braces they look like this there
this is my little braces pouch and they
look like this they're those like clear
I wash them this morning so a bit wet
sorry
clear braces that you just kind of clip
in and I've had these for a long time
now I've actually had some really nice
comments on my videos recently of you
guys commenting on my teeth being
straight which is really nice because I
didn't really do it for videos I didn't
even think anyone noticed my teeth
weren't that bad before growing up I had
the worst teeth ever I've had every
brace possible retainer train tracks
elastics headgear everything and then I
didn't wear my retainer
when I finished because I was a teenager
and they kind of went back my top teeth
weren't as bad because the problem I had
on top was that these teeth are huge and
my dentist I shaved them down so he
looks fine my button teeth are so
crooked my problem has always been I've
just got so many teeth in a really small
mouth I've got quite a small mouth so
I'd have like five teeth taken out when
I was younger my wisdom teeth are taken
out so that's why they cross over it
because they're always trying to kind of
make their way into the middle of my
mouth so my bottom teeth were really
crossed and I just wanted to kind of get
them fixed then I went to my dentist to
see who he uses because obviously
everyone's heard of Invisalign that's
like the Hollywood brand but I think the
best thing to do is just go to your
dentist that you trust and see who they
use and my dentist uses a brand called
clear guide which is exactly the same as
Invisalign has that kind of Hollywood
name so they can they can charge more
but clear guide is pretty much exactly
the same as far as I'm aware and he kind
of fitted me braces we did the top as
well cuz he thought we might as well
straighten them up a bit while we're
there and it was such an easy process I
have been doing it for about a year now
I think which sounds like a long time
but to be honest these things aren't
quick fixes I don't really believe and
like doing it in like three months
because
teeth of bones like it it takes a long
time to move and if you're gonna move in
that fast they're just gonna move back
so I don't mind it hasn't changed my
life in any way to be honest towards the
end now I can kind of wear them and I
not so much during the day and get away
with it because they still move loads
during the night it's just the beginning
well the dentist would tell you to wear
them all the time basically that's what
you should do at the beginning I had a
bit of a lisp but that went really
quickly and it only really hurt when you
get a new set of braces so every kind of
four weeks maybe put in a new brace and
it's always a bit tighter but it's so
clever the way it's done they give you
like a video of how your teeth are going
to move and then they give you all these
different braces and I think I'm really
near the end now because my teeth are
really straight I'll put in a photo now
of my teeth before and now so you can
see the difference and I think it's
really interesting and I'm so happy with
them so I definitely recommend clear
guide but also just see who your local
dentist uses if you are interested
price-wise it really depends on what you
need you go in for a consultation and it
depends how much your teeth need to move
it can be about a thousand pounds it can
be more if there isn't like a set price
it depends on your teeth really so that
is definitely a favorite of mine because
I feel like I'm near the end and I feel
like I've got straight teeth which is
really exciting because they never used
to I'll probably have to sleep wearing
this for like the rest of my life but
that's fine I'm used to it now so those
are all my monthly favourites and once
you guys watch this I am away in the
south of France with my family and I'm
so excited for holiday it's like
literally like a four day trip but I'm
really excited I'm gonna be vlogging
while on there because I want to share
it with you guys so I think I'm gonna
have two vlogs coming up this week a
vlog on Tuesday and a vlog on Thursday
so I hope you guys will enjoy that and I
hope you're all having a really great
weekend so I'll see you on Tuesday bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
