monthly favorites from june and i
probably say this a lot but this month
in particular has gone so fast i feel
like i just did my monthly favorites so
it was quite a struggle to collect all
my favorites because i feel like it
hasn't changed that much since last
month but i do have some bits here some
beauty a bit of food bit of like non
beauty other stuff as well so let me
just get my little thought I've got
everything here and I'm just gonna talk
through all the stuff I have in front of
me so the first thing I showed in my
last monthly makeup routine video and
it's a primer from Tom Ford this is
their illuminating primer and I love
this stuff it is pricey but it's really
worth it because it actually makes such
a difference to the skin I feel like
some of these illuminating primers don't
actually look that different once
they're on the skin but this one I've
been using a few different ways and I
love it I either mix it with some
moisturizer and just use it all over my
skin or I'll use a little bit on the
cheekbones and down my nose and this is
kind of a white primer they have just
bought out a new one which is more of
like a rosy tone which I'm now trying
out but I really love this one I've used
quite a lot you can see it's kind of
going up from the bottom I pretty much
use this everyday actually at the moment
mixing it with a moisturizer I just love
the glow it gives the skin perfect this
time of year not glittery or shimmery at
all just glowy yeah I'd say this is
probably one of my favorite Tom Ford
products now next up is another makeup
item and this is from urban decay this
is they're all nighter makeup setting
spray I do have the large one somewhere
but this is the travel size that I just
keep on my kind of beauty desk and I've
been using this when I finish my makeup
just at the end I might do a lot of
spirits now oh so nice it's really
refreshing to use but it also sets your
makeup and gives it a bit of Julius you
know sometimes I get carried away do my
makeup because I really enjoy doing it
and I might add a bit too much powder or
just go a bit too heavy on the makeup
and I feel like a little spritz of this
just kind of takes everything back a
little bit kind of blend it into the
skin better and I don't know if it makes
such a difference to me I I don't really
ever miss this step anymore when I'm
doing makeup when I can everyday basis
it's really nice i feel like i haven't
got much left in this one I must get
another travel size hey let's talk about
a non beauty favorite and I'm very late
to this bandwagon there's cereal
podcasts I think it's a podcast or audio
book I don't really know I've never
really got into them before obviously I
really love the ear biscuit once and
that was the first podcast I'd ever
tried listening to my phone is ringing
really bad timing everyone's always
talking about how good cereal is so I
thought I'd give it a go because I
really struggle to read books I used to
love reading and when I used to commune
into work who's the try and read but it
just doesn't really fit into my life at
the moment obviously I work from home so
I don't have that commute and then when
i do i find carry a book is quite like
heavy then it fit into any of my bags I
had a kindle that didn't work out I
didn't really enjoy like reading on a
Kindle so I just haven't read in ages
and its really sad I only really read on
like long beach holidays so what cereal
is is series off i think it's 10
episodes i think they're making a series
to season two now but the first one I
think is like 10 hour long episodes and
it's like an audiobook what I was
expecting it to just be someone reading
out a book I thought that could get
quite boring but it's so much better
than that because they've got like
characters in interviews and they bring
in other voices which makes it really
interesting and it's really exciting the
whole ideas they're trying to solve a
murder kind of mystery in this one and
its really gripping it's kind of weird
to sit on the tube listening because you
don't really know what to do with your
face if something happens you're like
and you can't really hide it and you do
have to really concentrate I find that
if I'm like claiming my phone I'll just
miss what happened has to go back so
it's quite good like brain exercise I
feel like you have to really concentrate
use your imagination and i love it and
really enjoying it i'm on i'm only on
episode three um but i'm completely like
I listen to it when I'm doing my makeup
now instead of watching YouTube videos
and I love it so that's why I'm holding
my phone it's on my phone I would really
recommend cereal okay next up is a
skincare product and it's sunday riley
luna I think I've spoken about this in a
blog post and another video how I talk
tomorrow did you I don't think I've
talks about our video this is a night
oil it's called a sleeping night oil and
it's blue it's got blue tansy in it and
retinol and blue Tansy's what makes it
blue obviously I love this stuff a lot
of people who have acne and scoring say
is great for healing that and I have
found that when I am spotty I had a big
spot here last week it does kind of heal
that much faster but i also just love it
as a night oil i put like three drops on
my hand you rub it into the skin and
once all the blue has disappeared you
know you've really worked it into the
in its not really oily and greasy like
some oils can be it's just really nice
and I kind of give myself a bit of a
facial massage when I'm using it I
pretty much use this every night I
really like it it just really agrees
with my skin it's pricey I know depends
if you want to invest into your skin
care or not but I think this is great ok
another non beauty here is my little jar
of granola I don't really know whether
it's called granola or like oats or I
don't know but I made this and I'm
really proud of myself because I hate
breakfast sorry if that upsets anyone
but I never I never know what eat for
breakfast like I just have not found my
thing I've been searching my whole life
for the perfect breakfast and I think I
may have found it these oats basically I
made these I kind of made them up using
a few different recipes and a few
products I like in looking at the
ingredients and I use these in the
morning and I use them in the evening as
like a little sweet treat dessert
basically what's inside is just ground
almonds jumbo oats maple syrup coconut
oil and a bit of cinnamon it's really
very simple it's very healthy I mean
maple syrup it's sweet but it's all
natural and I think it's fine it's not
unhealthy you can go a bit over the top
I think with the healthiness but it's so
so delicious I normally hate granola and
nuts and those kind of things I find
them so bland and boring to eat these
are so delicious seriously I've made all
my friends and family try it and then
they can't believe how delicious it is
so I've used it loads of different ways
that's what I love about it you can heat
it in so many different ways I've had it
just in a bowl with almond milk as like
a serial or sprinkled on top of fruit or
I've made like apple puree and sprinkle
it on top of that and wish you can have
a breakfast or you can have that as like
a crumble for dessert I've just had it
by itself is like an afternoon snack
there's so many different ways you can
use this and it's so so delicious so if
you want me to do a video on how to make
these because I know you guys like my
last kind of cooking video let me know
if you want me to do that I'm not
particularly good at cooking but I kind
of that's why i like to make cooking
videos because i think it's nice to
watch someone normal who's not a pro do
things like that so let me know if you
would like that video ok next up is from
soap and glory this is the orange azum
their names are ridiculous exfoliating
body polish this is an in shower body
scrub
really like this I love the packaging is
very easy to use smells orangi and zesty
which is a type of scent I love in the
shower because it kind of wakes you up
and its really refreshing and I've been
using this as a scrub most times most
times like every other shower but
especially when I'm tanning this is
quite a scrubby swab but it's in like a
gel formula so it's also quite easy to
spread around your body if that makes
sense find a packaging lovely product
and yeah if you see this in your local
boots and superdrug I'd say pick it up
because it's great and it's huge it will
last so long I am so happy i picked up
this makeup brushes the RM k powder
cheek brush the packaging it's gross but
i want to keep it in there it's just a
little powder brush and it's very
similar to the suku one that Lisa
Eldridge uses all the time the companies
are owned by the same company they're
pretty much sister companies so although
it's much cheaper it's very similar and
it's the perfect size for blusher and
powder and I use it every day I either
use it to set my makeup or I've been
using it with the hourglass ambient
lighting powder on my cheekbones or for
blusher I could just use it for
everything and it's got a really good
little short handle so it's great for
traveling and I love it it's so soft
seriously so soft I love this brush if
you are by Selfridges they sell it there
we can get it online it's great i really
really recommend it next up is a perfume
and this one's actually quite new to me
but I have fallen in love with it I'm
really fussy with perfumes I hate all
those type of perfumes you get in like
beauty halls like standard beauty was
like Governor's House of Fraser like all
the mainstream kind of big brand perfume
I find the smell so powdery and sweet
and fake in it they always make me feel
a bit like sick so I love you guys know
I love like Joe Malone dipti call the
very natural smelling perfumes and I was
actually sent this one it's from a bad
brand called Bella Freud which I sell in
space NK they used to do candles and
other do perfumes and this is ginsburg
is god and they have four different
perfumes I think if I'm correct this one
is oh god I really should have like
researched this I'm going to link it
below it's very earthy and quite
masculine as well let me just brace up
on me it really smells quite muscular
actually I like muscular
perfumes and it's different it's not
sweet at all it's quite earthy if you
like fake type perfumes it hasn't I
think it might have figured it's not
doesn't really smell a fake but it
smells of that sort of green earthy
scent that was hard to describe but I
hope you've got a kind of sense of what
it smells like next time you're a space
okay just give it a sniff I really like
it I love the bottle as well okay my
last favorites of the month are my
braces now you guys might or might not
know that I have braces because I've see
I don't wear them in videos but I do I
have clear braces they look like this
there this is my little braces pouch um
and they look like this they're those
like clear or I wash them this morning
so a bit wet sorry clear braces that you
just kind of clip in and I've had these
for a long time now I've actually had
some really nice comments on my videos
recently of you guys commenting on my
teeth being straight which is really
nice because I didn't really do it for
videos I didn't even think anyone would
notice my teeth weren't that bad before
growing up I had the worst Heath ever
I've had every brace possible retainer
train tracks elastics headgear
everything and then I didn't wear my
retainer when I finished because I was a
teenager and they kind of went back my
top teeth weren't as bad because the
problem i had on top was that these
teeth a huge and my dentists like shaved
them down so he looks fine my doc button
teeth are so crooked my problem has
always been I've just got so many teeth
in a really small mouth I've got quite a
small mouth so I'd have like five teeth
taken out when I was younger my wisdom
teeth are taken out so that's why they
cross over it because they're always
trying to kind of make their way into
the middle of my mouth so my bottom
teeth were really cost and I just wanted
to kind of get them fixed then I went to
my dentist to see who he uses because
obviously everyone's heard of Invisalign
that's like the Hollywood brand but I
think the best thing to do is just go to
your dentist that you trust and see who
they use and my dentist uses a brand
called clear guide which is exactly the
same as Invisalign has that kind of
Hollywood name so they can they can
charge more but clear guide is pretty
much exactly the same as far as I'm
aware and he kind of fitted me braces we
did the top as well cuz he thought we
might as well straighten them up a bit
while we're there and it was such an
easy process I have been doing it for
about a year now I think which sounds
like a long time but realize these
things aren't quick fixes I don't really
believe and like doing it in like three
months because teeth
like it takes a long time to move and if
we're going to move in that fast they're
just going to move back so I don't mind
it hasn't changed my life in any way to
be honest towards the end now I can kind
of wear them at night not so much during
the day and get away with it because
they still move loads during the night
it's just the beginning well the dentist
would tell you to wear them all the time
basically that's what you should do at
the beginning I had a bit of a lisp but
that went really quickly and they only
really hurt when you get a new set of
braces so every kind of four weeks maybe
put in a new brace and it's always a bit
tighter but it's so clever the way it's
done they give you like a video of how
your teeth are going to move and then
they give you all these different braces
and I think I'm really near the end now
because I teeth a really straight I'll
put in a photo now of my teeth before
and now so you can see the difference
and i think is really interesting and
i'm so happy with them so i definitely
recommend clear guide but also just see
who your local dentist uses if you are
interested price-wise it really depends
on what you need you go in for a
consultation and it depends how much
your teeth need to move it can be about
a thousand pounds it can be more if
there isn't like a set price it depends
on your teeth really so that is
definitely a favor of mine because I
feel I come near the end I feel like
I've got straight teeth which is really
exciting because they never used to I'll
probably have to sleep wearing this for
like the rest of my life but that's fine
I'm used to it now so those are all my
monthly favorites and once you guys
watch this I am away in the South of
France and my family and I'm so excited
for holiday it's like literally like a
four day trip but I'm really excited I'm
gonna be vlogging one on there because I
want to share it with you guys so I
think I'm gonna have to vlog coming up
this week of log on Tuesday and a vlog
on Thursday so I hope you guys will
enjoy that and I hope you're all having
a really great weekend so I'll see you
on Tuesday bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
