favorites but before I start I just
wanted to say a big thank you for your
nice comments on the videos that me and
Anna film together we really loved
filming together so we're really happy
with the kind of positive feedback and
because you guys wrote so many nice
things and those people said I want to
see more videos you guys together we've
decided to start filming together a
little bit more regularly so we're going
to start doing a beauty chat video and
we're basically again it will turn it
each month on each other's channel so
one month it will be on my channel the
next month it be on her channel it's
just going to be a beauty chat video
where we sit and chat about beauty which
is what we love to do and but what we
would love from you guys is if you could
comment on this video or tweet us my
Twitter's at Lily pebbles and Anna's is
at Vivian and makeup you could tweet us
any kind of beauty questions or topics
will basically pick around five per
video and we'll answer your questions or
just like discuss beauty topics and show
products etc it's quite flexible but
we'd love kind of questions from you
guys Beauty questions so that would be
great if you want to comment on this
video or tweet us so I'm going to get
started with my monthly favorites first
thing is something that I've been using
for a while now and I don't think I've
mentioned it in any favorites video so I
thought it's about time I better put it
in and it's the pixie glow tonic I'm
sure if you read Caroline here in this
blog you'll know about it already it's
basically a dupe for p50 clarins toner
any kind of really good exfoliating
tonette it's only 16 pounds it's
impossible to get hold of there's a
pixie store on Carnaby Street in London
which is where i got mine from but they
don't have a website that you can order
from i think you can phone at the store
and they can send you some but they're
always out of stock because of Caroline
but it's basically just a really good
exfoliating toner but it's gentle enough
for you to use kind of every day or even
twice a day if you want to I just use
this in the evening with cotton wool all
over my face and it just really smooths
out your skin I prefer using something
like this then like a harsh scrub on my
face but yeah I really like this and
I've been really enjoying using it so
thank you caroline the next product I
talked about in my last video and it's
the Dior BB cream and I've just been
loving this the
I the shade 002 it's just so nice I'm
really not into the whole BB cream thing
anymore they're so overdone everyone has
been teams but I bought this not because
of the skincare benefits or anything
like that I don't even know if they're
any good but the actual like finish of
the product is really nice it's just
such a nice tinted moisturizer I think I
prefer it to my Laura Mercier tinted
moisturizer which is one of my favorites
I love the packaging it's really small
and easy to keep in your makeup bag and
I love everything about it it's not too
glowy it's not to matts it's just kind
of the perfect your skin but better
finish the next makeup product is
unfortunately another one that's really
hard to get hold of and I don't that you
can buy this in the UK I talked about
this product in my blog post which I'll
link below called across the pond or
from across the pond and Amelia lovely
amelia was so kind and brought me back
loads of products from New York would
she went on holiday and this was one of
them and it's the oh I did have never
been pronounced it right for josie maran
coconut water colors cheek juillet and
it's in poppy paradise and it's a little
pot and it's basically a cream blusher
it's not really cream it's kind of like
a gel which is really weird it's really
weird text to compare to any kind of
cream blusher I've tried it's very jelly
like it's kind of like a lip balm I
really like it leaves a really nice kind
of subtle flush of color on your cheeks
and I know that looks like a pretty
scary color but it comes out so share
and it's really easy to build upon and I
just really like this kind of everyday
natural makeup look and i love that it
comes in a little pot and yeah i really
like this so if I go to America anytime
soon I definitely will check out some
other stuff in this brand because I was
really impressed with this blusher the
next product is a new concealer that
I've also done a blog post so I'll link
that below and it's the NARS radiant
creamy concealer and I got the shade
vanilla which a lot of people are
tweeting me saying this is out of stock
kind of in London so maybe this is kind
of the most popular shade but I'm sure
they'll get more in it it's naz so you
kind of find nods anywhere really and
I'm really like this concealer i
finished my origins plant scription
concealer so I ones who tries to make
new because I've been using that kind of
the whole of this year and and I love
niles products so I tried this in store
and I really liked it i don't like
consumers that too cakey so and this one
didn't feel KQ tool and it's not i
really like it
gives really good coverage you can
definitely build up to curve a
full-coverage concealer but it does
leave like a nice radiant finish as well
so it doesn't look too color cakey
doesn't look too heavy yeah I like
everything about this i definitely
recommend it the next makeup product is
from Smashbox and I've actually never
tried anything for Smashbox before I
don't think I do like their lid primer
that I've just tried recently but apart
from that I'm quite kind of new to the
brand i'm not sure why but i've recently
tried this palette from them which is
called the heatwave palette they think
I'm just in love with it it looks like
this it's got ten shades and I would
absolutely wear them all that's what I
love about this palette I hate when I
shadow palettes there's like some shady
like and some you'd never really wear
but i would literally wear all of these
there's two macked colors and the rest
of shimmer but none of them are kind of
overly glittery or anything like that
there's kind of six neutrals I think and
then there's a kind of blue but one that
you can easily wear as a liner a really
nice brownie green a purpley kind of
shade and then a dark brown and I love
the texture of these eyeshadows I love
the colors it comes to the brush which
is actually really good blending brush
and only the brush is a bit rubbish that
comes with a palette but I love this
palette I love all the shades I'm really
a bit obsessed for that I've been using
it kind of every day for the last couple
of weeks so yeah I definitely recommend
getting this it's about same price as
the Naked palette so it just depends
what kind of colors you like yeah I
really like the same it's much more
compact to like putting your makeup bag
the next to a bit more random and the
first one are these flannels from
Primark if you're not from the UK I
think flannel might be in English word
is basically just a face cloth and I've
used muzzling cloths for ages but I feel
like they don't dry that quickly and I
use one per day so one in the morning
one in the evening so I kind of wanted
to driver tell me it's the evening and
so I picked up these from Primark and I
think it was three for a pound or three
for a pound fifty which is just such a
bargain and I really like the natural
really good quality I've washed them
tumble dried them and they're still soft
and I got four in white I think or six
maybe a comic Ramona ago and I got sort
of mint as well so I just kind of lined
them up on my sink and I think they look
really pretty and yeah I just like the
idea of having kind of a pile of
flannels might think so
is always one there I'd have to kind of
rummage into a drawer to grab one and
I'd have a little basket on the floor by
my sink I throw the dirty ones in and
wash them and it's a whole big life
cycle of face washing the next favorite
is this bag from whistles and I have
loved these little kind of they call the
makeup bags but it can be clutch bags as
well I've loved them for so long but
they're 35 pounds I've always just
thought I just don't need one but
recently whistles sale has started and I
noticed that the makeup bags had been
reduced to 25 pounds most of us i could
find with a bright pink ones which i did
actually buy originally but then I found
this one so i swapped it because this is
the one I wanted it's black on one side
and it says whistles in gold on the
front and then on the other side it's
mint blue mint blue yeah which I
absolutely love i really like that it's
double sided because i use this as a
clutch bag last week at a party and it
looks really smart with like the black
side out but this kind of just makes it
a bit more interesting so I've been
using this as my little kind of beauty
bag in my handbag keeping my lipsticks
and dry shampoo and stuff but when I go
out I can also use this as a clutch bag
and yeah I got 25 pounds in the sale and
i love it i don't think they have this
one on the website they did have some
pink ones left but i think they're going
pretty fast this is kind of the new
bloggers curries i think but it's really
nice and it's leather by the way I
didn't say it was leather I really
wanted to include a nail polish at my
favorites video but I just find it so
hard because I literally paint my nails
every other day and I'm always trying
out new colors because i have so many
and i just want to try every color that
i have but i do nail post every sunday
on my blog so if you want to see you
kind of the colors I've been wearing
recently I'll leave some links below but
you can just go to my blog and look at
Sunday's posts and I have lots of pretty
nail colors on there because I just
can't pick one favorite i love the one
of mine today or just bourgeois but yeah
there's just so many I love I couldn't
pick one so thank you for watching
that's all my June favorites don't
forget to comment below or tweet me in
Anna with your questions for us to start
filming and really excited I think it's
going to be really fun to phone like
beauty chat videos and thank you so much
