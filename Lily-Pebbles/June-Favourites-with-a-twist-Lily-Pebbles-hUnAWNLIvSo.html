gonna be a little bit different it's
gonna have quite the twist on it
and I mentioned in a couple of videos
ago and on my snapchat and on my
Instagram and Twitter I kind of started
the discussion about monthly favorites
because I got a surprising comment quite
a few comments new people saying they
didn't actually like them and monthly
favorites video have just become
something that is part of the beauty and
fashion community on YouTube and it's
just one of those things that we all do
and we've all done since the beginning
and I feel like we have never really
questioned it before but actually when I
started speaking to you guys my viewers
I realized that not everyone actually
loves them they love the idea of them
but I got a lot of people saying that
they don't like that everyone uploads
them at the same time on the same day
because it gets a bit repetitive
watching one after the other they don't
like that it's just constant favorite
products after favourite products and it
gets a bit boring to watch and how can
anyone possibly have that many favorite
products every month and I completely
agreed with all the points and I just
kind of find yourself nodding along and
agreeing so I thought what can I do to
change this up and this is completely
for your benefit and not mine because my
monthly favorites videos get really good
views what I look deeper into it though
although people were clicking on the
video they weren't watching the whole
thing and I feel like a lot of people
click on favorites videos look in the
description box to see what what the
products are and then click off and to
some people views it all that matters
but for me I want people to be watching
my whole video and I want my viewers to
enjoy the video so some people might
think I'm crazy
changing something that isn't
technically broken I'm still getting the
views but I really wanted to change it
up and just do something that I think
you guys would enjoy a bit more so this
is my experimental monthly favorites
I've called it June favorites because I
don't want people not to click on it
because they think it's something else
so the titles are work in progress I
don't know what I'm gonna call this I
want people to still watch the video but
I also want it to reflect what the
actual video is about so please let me
know what you think I should call these
videos and let me know if you think this
is a good idea you know I'm just trying
it out feedback is welcome if you hate
it and you prefer the old format that's
fine I'll go back to that I just wanted
to try out something new I always want
to grow and evolve it's really important
to me so I just wanted to try this out I
think it's worth taking the risk so how
is this month's monthly favorites
different to all my others well it's mid
month so it's halfway through the month
I'm gonna do it
as a mid month update but also the date
doesn't really matter because it's
always gonna be a month since my last
videos so it doesn't really matter if
it's at the end of the month or the
middle of the month but this way you
won't have to watch my video in the same
day as everyone else's favorites videos
I'm also go throw in a load more
category so this isn't just beauty
favorites this isn't just fashion
favorites there's lots of things going
on in this video is packed full of all
different kind of things and again this
is not a benefit to me because
technically I could make this video into
about 4 or 5 separate videos but I'm
putting it all in one which means that
I've got to think of lots of other
videos to do but I think it makes a
better video for you guys to watch so
let me get on with it and let's see if
you like it it's what's been going on in
my life so far this month I took part in
swauk with Anna swauk was a charity walk
run by look good feel better we're both
ambassadors for the charity and it was
so so good
we met loads of viewers it was such a
fun day we took friends and family with
us I didn't realize I would enjoy the
walking part so much it's made me want
to like go on more walks it was in the
beautiful vineyards in Dorking and I had
such a nice day we've got really muddy
my shoes completely disintegrated and
fell apart and then we had a nice pub
lunch afterwards so thank you to
everyone who donated to our Just Giving
page we're gonna be doing more stuff
with look good feel better this year
it's a charity we both love so that was
really fun my first projects with them
I'm heading off to LA tomorrow it'll be
tomorrow when you watch this I'm going
to LA for four or five days and then
heading to Anaheim where VidCon takes
place VidCon is this huge YouTube
conference loads of youtubers from all
over the world get together there's
panels there's meetups I mainly go
because I love to meet other content
creators other youtubers and it's a
great time to just everyone get together
everyone's in one place at the same time
you have loads of meetings and I'm going
with Ana again so I'm really looking
forward to it I think we're gonna have a
really fun time in LA we've got a few
things planned looking forward to a bit
of sunshine kind of dreading the jet lag
but I hope I'm not as bad this time as I
was last time so that is where I will be
if you suddenly start seeing palm trees
on my Instagram that is why if you want
to follow me on Instagram and snapchat
my username is just Lily pebbles I'm
gonna be posting hopefully a lot while
I'm out there and making lots of videos
so let me know there's anything specific
you want to see I'm going to try and do
lots of vlogs and maybe some other cool
things too
I had my
this month by hirtius ins I went in for
a haircut and then while I was there I
saw Jason who does my color so he's
based in the Harvey Nichols branch he is
incredible he does my balayage I love it
I had a few gray hairs to cover and my
roots were kind of just looking a bit
funny so we went over the roots and
actually since then I think it's gone a
little bit too warm and brassy so I'm
gonna go back but apart from that I
absolutely love the balayage perfect for
the summer and we're gonna try and just
maintain it like this for a while
because I think it's a nice color we
just need to get rid of the slight
brassiness my hair always goes warm it's
so annoying I also went to see my friend
Caroline hyerin's for a facial so she
offered to give me one and it was the
best thing ever I'm not just saying that
because she's a friend of mine I had
lots of facials in my time and I love
that she did all kinds of things she did
a peel she put me under this like crazy
red light that was like right close up
to my face but the best part for me was
the facial massage I've never like
noticed such instant results but I've
really enjoyed it she took a really long
time and I really kind of quite heavily
massage my face and it just felt great
it really felt like it was doing good
stuff I really enjoyed it and I've never
really experienced that kind of facial
massage from other facials so she is
brilliant I will link her blog down
below so you can keep up with everything
she's up to and hopefully get a facial
yourself one day so let's talk Beauty
favorites which is why a lot of you
might be here this is kind of a regular
favorite kind of stuff first off Liz
Earle cleanse and polish I know I talk
about this all the time but I just
finished another one so I thought I
would mention it I haven't got I haven't
got another one to go onto I need to buy
one but after New York my skin was just
playing up my skin is so bad on a
long-haul flight but this really helped
I feel like when my skin is going crazy
this is such a nice basic natural
cleanser it's creamy it takes off makeup
well so I've just used this for like the
last four weeks I haven't used anything
else and I've really really been
enjoying it so I finished that I've gone
back to Askia but I do want to pick up
another one of these I've also been
loving my Chanel lip balm Hydra Beauty
lip balm this is all I'm wearing today
actually and I really like this because
it's somewhere between a cream and like
a silicone lip balm it feels like a
cream on your lips but it hasn't got
that white creamy finish because that
bit can be quite annoying when you put a
lip balm on and it makes your lips
really pale it just looks like a pretty
lip gloss but it feels so creamy and
hydrating
I've also been enjoyed the
new launch from collab collab is a dry
shampoo range and this is a new one for
them it's the active one it's different
to the original because it offers UV
protection so it protects your hair from
the Sun pollution protection which is
great because I'm always out and about
on the tube and it's conditioning so
it's a bit more like an on-the-go active
gym goer dry shampoo but it just feels
great in the hair it doesn't leave it
white or chalky it smells really nice I
think whew
and I love the packaging like a summary
that is I need to wonder if they do
minis of the active one because if they
do I'm gonna get some and take it to LA
with me
I've also had a couple of disappointing
beauty products this month always a bit
of a downer to talk about the products
that disappoint me especially when
they're from brands that I love but I
think it's a nice type of balance
there's always things that I love and
there's always gonna be things that I
don't love so I wanted to share with you
guys the first one is a new launch from
Too Faced and it's the mascara melt off
it's a cleansing oil waterproof mascara
dissolver clever idea it's in this
little tube which is great for traveling
and it's a very very thin like mascara
wand so the idea is you meant to kind of
brush it on and then your mascara melts
off but the practicality of it just
doesn't work I kind of brushed it on and
then my mascara was running in my face
and then I kind of rubbed it in and took
it off with a muslin cloth some cloth
and water and it didn't all come off it
was incredibly messy
I just think cotton wool and waterproof
eye makeup remover works perfectly well
and it's not as messy and fiddly so this
didn't work out for me
I was also incredibly disappointed and I
think I was even more disappointed
because I was so excited for the launch
of the Estee Lauder Estee edit so this
is the new collection a new range that
they have launched with kendall Jenner I
was excited when I heard about it
because the idea of a kind of Sabra and
a best de l'Ordre that's aimed at
younger girls is a great idea but I find
that it's still quite expensive and I'm
not sure the products are right for the
age that it's supposed to be aimed at I
found the whole thing a bit confusing
and there are some very strange products
in there so I put us on that bar like
the blusher but then that's just a
blusher
you can kind of get a blusher from
anywhere I'll show you what this blush
looks like very non-offensive fine some
of the kind of basic products are quite
liked but there were a lot of the
products that I really didn't get on
with first one is the Edit eyeshadow
palette I don't really mind packaging
that much the color choice in here I
just find bizarre very very very sparkly
not even shimmery sparkly kind of
highlights eyeshadows and then this kind
of strange split eyeshadow thing that I
really don't like none of the colors
worked for me
I just find this palette very strange so
didn't go on with that they have these
lip flip shade transformers again I just
think it's a bit confusing and a little
bit trihard
one is a yellow lipstick and one is
black and you meant to apply these on
top of your normal lipsticks to change
the color I've tried it didn't really
work that well for me it didn't really
understand the point I feel like it's
better just to find a lipstick shade
that suits you little bit gimmicky for
the price the eyeliner I didn't get on
with because it's a really fat felt tip
pen and it went all over my lid and was
really hard to control
not at all precise or easy to use and
then one of the standout products that
everyone was kind of raving about is the
beam team hydrates and glow this is a
chew and it's a glowy kind of primer a
highlighter in the cheap and then in the
lid is a little kind of cream
highlighter but I found it really dark
and shimmery and bronze very hard to
wear and very kind of chunky so yeah
that was a real shame I really like
kendall Jenner and I love Estee Lauder
as a brand I was really excited for it
but there weren't any stand up for us
for me that I would kind of continue to
use maybe as they bring out more
products that might change but for now
those are my thoughts so let me talk to
you about products that I'm testing as
you guys know I get sent a lot of things
and I'm under no obligation to talk
about them but I'm always trying things
and if I fall in love with them I like
to share them with you guys the first
thing I'm trying is from Joe Malone this
is their new Lord they have like one big
launch a year but then lots of little
ones as well I think this is there big
launch it's basil and neroli so it's a
new cologne it's unisex I'm wearing it
today and I really like it I'm very
fussy with perfumes I kind of know
straight away if I like or not and this
one's quite fresh it's not at all heavy
it's very easy to wear it's hard to
describe cents but go and give this one
a sniff if you're near a German
counter because I think this is one of
those ones that a lot of people will
like and get on with you guys know I'm
big jo Malone fan so I'm always happy
when there's a new fragrance that I like
I'm also trying this up from Bobby Brown
which is quite exciting it's the instant
confidence stick and I know it's had a
little bit of stick for being a wrinkle
eraser line smoother I know we're meant
to embrace our wrinkles but if there's a
product that helps kind of make them
look less harsh I think that's a great
thing so the idea is that it's the stick
it's quite like silicone II and you rub
it over lines and it smooth them out
instantly and I know it sounds gimmicky
but it does work and for me the area
that I really like it is here because I
get a line that after I do my makeup I
always get a line here and it creases my
foundation creases so I take this and I
simply just like swipe it and blend it
in and it gets rid of the line I don't
know how well this work with really like
deep wrinkles but I think if you're kind
of my age and you're starting to see
fine lines and wrinkles this is kind of
quite a fun thing to just keep in your
handbag and just smooth out any wrinkles
that you have around your eyes or around
your mouth I'm kind of liking it so far
but I'm still trying it out and also
some more stuff from Estee Lauder that
I'm trying out they fought back the
bronze goddess collection every summer
they bring it out the most incredible
scented products the perfume is
delicious if you love like some cream
summer scents go check out the bronze
goddess perfume they've got some other
products this year they've got a face
palette so this has a highlighter
blusher and a bronzer in it I'm actually
wearing the highlighter and blush today
I think that blush is really nice
pristine pink highlighter doesn't show
up that well but it's it's nice
they're quite subtle they're not the
most pigmented products but I really
liked the Estee Lauder face products and
I think this is a really nice palette I
think that'd be a sell out and then also
this which is the bronze goddess
luminous liquid I love a liquid
highlighter just took me ages to figure
out how it works the packaging was a
little bit dodgy but I've put it on the
tops of my cheekbones and down my nose
and I think it's really nice and kind of
blend it in with your foundation or put
it on with a brush and then put on your
your bronzer it's pretty I think this is
quite similar to the champagne pop
better liquid highlighter it's a peachy
golden highlight and that is really nice
and I
that is in the little packaging have a
few style favorites as well to tell you
guys first of all this t-shirt which
just may look like a plain white t-shirt
if you guys follow me on snapchat
Instagram you'll know what this t-shirt
is it's from never fully dressed and
it's amazing are you ready for this you
know stand up oh yeah boob t-shirt
before anything is that they don't
actually fit my boobs like they're
smaller than my real boobs
this t-shirt I love it as soon as I saw
her I was like I want that I get some
really weird looks wearing it I wore it
to the Charlotte Street Hotel which is
pretty posh and I took my jacket off and
I just kept forget forgetting that I was
wearing it and I got some really weird
looks but I like getting weird looks I
like being a bit different and why not
they're just boobs not a big deal and
also it's not even like I'm wearing a
picture of boobs it's pretty much just a
line and a dot if there was another dot
you'd think it was a smiley face so I
really liked this t-shirt I also had to
take this out of my laundry basket so
it's really gross and sweaty this added
ass vest I bought it from Urban
Outfitters I'm not gonna do a cutaway
because it needs to wash but it's pretty
much just a plain black vest with white
around the edges and that Adi Dassler go
and I wear this for the gym and I like
it because it's slightly longer on the
front and the back so it covers my bum I
don't wear thongs to the gym or any
fancy underwear I would prefer to be
comfortable and have visible panty line
I do not really care but it is nice to
have something covers your bum so that
people don't see your nickel line it
just fits nicely it's very comfortable
and it's still so I'm gonna put that
back also I picked up some sandals I
love Steve Madden in America they do
half sizes and Steve Madden which is
just a lifesaver for me but in general
they're just really comfy shoe I put my
wedding shoes from there which is
exciting they always feel comfortable I
don't wear shoes that aren't comfy as a
rule so I normally end up Brian shoes
from Steve Madden and I saw these in the
big Topshop and answer circuits they
have Steve Madden downstairs so I saw
these and got them and I really really
liked them I think they're gonna be
great for summer they are sandals black
this is a very popular style at the
moment open-toe which means they're
comfortable because I've weird toes that
flick up and hurt really not a high heel
at all which means that they can be worn
during the day but I think this could be
worn in the night as well I'm tall so I
don't need to wear high heels and this
fit kind of straps up your ankle which
is a little bit more uncomfortable
you get used to it I think these are so
so cool and I'm really excited to wear
them I'm gonna take me to LA with me
before I end this video I have a couple
of internet things to recommend to you
first of all Adrienne bliss I'm a huge
fan of Adrienne's YouTube channel he
launched it last year and she's had the
channel for a while but last year he
started vlog Bemba I think it was called
log remember when he vlogs every day and
now he's doing balloon he's locking
every day in June but this is not normal
he is a hilarious comedian is he a
comedian or just a funny guy and he
basically take the piss out of other
youtubers and waiting for him to do
something to do it like beauty and
fashion people I really think you should
do a ye in a day video would be so funny
it's quite like subtle I feel like
unless you know the YouTube like typical
things that people do you might not find
it that funny but if you do and
obviously if you're watching this video
you probably watch other videos on
YouTube
I think you'll enjoy Adrienne's videos
they just make me laugh so much like
every night when I'm doing my skincare
routine I'm just like laughing and I
think that's what it's all about and
it's great I also watched the James
Corden Late Late Show carpool karaoke
with Red Hot Chili Peppers and it was
brilliant I forget how many of their
songs I absolutely loved and they came
across so well it was so fun James
Corden just seemed that he was having
the best time ever that was so good to
watch I would really recommend giving it
a watch if you have a bit of free time
so that's everything from my June
favorites with a twist please let me
know what you think if you were me to
continue doing this mid month pack them
full of all these different kind of
things you know I love the feedback so
give it to me I'm ready I'll see you
guys in my next video look for too lots
of la content hopefully and thank you so
much for watching bye I feel like I do a
really weird wave bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
