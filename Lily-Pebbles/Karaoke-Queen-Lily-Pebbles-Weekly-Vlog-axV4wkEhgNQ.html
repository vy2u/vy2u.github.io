sorry for my appearance but I'm still
kind of getting over the jetlag and
getting back into my normal routine so
everything's a bit of a mess and I'm
definitely wearing odd socks it's just
one of those days so today it's got a
few bits and bobs to do first of all I'm
gonna swap Gemma's birthday present it's
her birthday tomorrow and we said beware
I'm gonna do presents because you've
obviously just both been to New York
together and spent loads of money so I'm
not really buying her present I just
thought I'd get something small and
thoughtful because I don't want to not
give her anything so I'm gonna go get
that printed and I will show you what
I'm going to the printers now and then
I'll come back and show you what the
present is and then later I'm going to
my cousin's because I'm gonna do her
makeup for a Halloween party she has
tonight and then that's about it for
today rich was working from home but now
he's going into work so how you been on
the blog for ages I okay so I just got
back from the printer and I thought I'd
show you what I'm doing for Gemma's
birthday as I said it's just a small
little thoughtful gift because I'm not
really doing presents this year but I
saw this print on Etsy and I thought it
was really cute and that's literally
exactly what we said before we booked on
New York trip we were Armenian are in
for ages and yeah that's basically what
we decided on so I downloaded this print
from Etsy the digital version and took
it to a printer and I got them to print
it on like a 5 7 photo size card
double-sided so they Silas and then I've
bought this frame from Muji I love these
frames for their like acrylic blocks
herbs they look really smart and I think
I look really nice and her flat so you
just separate these they're magnetic to
there in two parts like that and then
you put the picture in the middle and
this is the large size of the frame and
then you put the block on top there is
all together so just like this and you
can sit it up on the table or something
and it's double sided and I just now
it's quite cute you can always just take
this out and put a normal photo in if
she wants but I think it's a nice
thought and it will be a nice memory of
our fun trip to New York so there's a
little present idea if you wanted
something cheap but thoughtful to gift
to a friend I really like this frames
and you can put any sort of photo in it
or a print is a really nice idea this is
a terrible breakfast but I've made some
crispy bacon and ketchup and
I'm starting my day but I've done a bit
of work this morning and now I have to
head out to get Jemma a birthday card
wrapping paper and then I'm going for
laser and then I'm going to my cousin
okay I'm back and I'm not sure what I
filmed because I kind of forgot I was
vlogging but I went to the place to get
laser basically gone to a new place and
I didn't realize I have to get a patch
test burst even though I've got it done
before so I got that done I have to go
back on Monday for my treatment in case
any of you guys are curious I get my
upper lip and my face done not not
afraid not afraid not ashamed to say
that um you know hairy girl problems a
lot of people who have asked me to make
a video on it but I wouldn't really know
what to say I'm definitely not an expert
I'm probably not even going to the place
that has the best machine or anything I
just kind of go by pain and whether it
lasts but this new place like doesn't
hurt as much at all so I'm going to try
that out on Monday I then went to see my
cousin and she was dressing as
Tinkerbell this Halloween so I did her
makeup and I'm no makeup artist but I
tried my best I did like green sparkly
eyes with like a pink glitter and then
we used the hair trucks as well on her
hair which was pretty cool and I think
she was happy with the final look so now
I just need to wrap up Gemma's present
and card
guys today has been a terrible day for
vlogging and now I have wet frizzy hair
and I need to go straight in it so I'll
see you tomorrow for hopefully a better
day of logging sorry
morning it's Saturday and I'm gonna
attempt the hat again I'm just so scared
of hats I feel like it'd look like such
an idiot in it but it kind of looks cool
as well I just don't really know but I'm
wearing it with quite a casual outfit
and wearing my knee brandy melville
sweater which is very loose and casual
and black jeans and boots and my
rucksack
I don't really know what we're doing
today but we're gonna head out I think
the image might try to pull of outfit
lifestyle photos for my blog and then
I'm looking after my nephew this
afternoon and then that's Gemma's
birthday today so we're going out
tonight for dinner that should be really
nice morning we have a problem I still
can't find my sunglasses seriously
this is what happens every Saturday
morning I spend hours getting ready
because I like to hit my time on the
weekend and then by the time I get
downstairs I think alright let's go and
then rich isn't ready even though he
said hours to get ready so now he's
laughing and I'm waiting for him guys do
you think rich can pull off the double
denim look no she's dead
okay his cotton shirt that looks denim
with denim jeans though she's blue wow
this is like Justin Timberlake in 99
changing no good I found my sunglasses
they were in the glove compartment in a
different case that isn't mine
whew rich nailed it with the outfit
shots today look at that it's getting
better and better by the day okay we're
heading back to Hannah's quickly to have
a quick catch-up cuz I haven't seen her
in ages
we're both starving hungry now so we're
gonna go to try and find somewhere to
eat lunch or money salad II I'm just
listening to first aid kit in the car
and you guys all commented on my vlogs
and I can't believe you haven't heard of
the first aid kit but I had them but
they were pretty good then I downloaded
album and I really liked it so I would
definitely recommend it if you also
hadn't heard of them we're having a very
pricey dinner tonight so try save money
and instead went for a supermarket lunch
so we just grabbed some bits of MLS and
we're gonna head to my sisters and eat
those and it cost us half the amount and
then lunch would have so we need to do
that more often just turned up the
jojo's and look what she's making for
this Bailey Smith party going home
president serving a superhero party so
we're making superhero chocolate
lollipops hope I don't know how you make
lollipops that she made these and then
she's wrapping them up ridiculous you
guys should have a mommy blog she
doesn't have the time but look how
amazing I can't do that well done and
she belongs we've mixed together so
maybe a stylist and a bit of chicken for
some proteins or like a salad each
chicken mix show me your trees and a
pumpkin basket did you get chocolates
hmm pick out you saving it what I'm
saving it for a rainy day party
boy watching come home and got into my
comfies because it's like a cold
Saturday afternoon now I'm eating a
fruit roll-up
oops I'm kind of working my way through
the box but ace is here my other nephew
and we're going to be looking after him
for about an hour until my other sister
gets back
lots of aunty duties going on this
weekend but I love it yeah I've been
there time to get ready for tonight I
don't know how that happened I don't
know what to wear a micro dress did you
I've got I don't know I don't know I
don't know okay I think I'm going for
the stress which is quite old from
Topshop it's definitely quite figure
hugging I don't really wear tight things
anymore but what the hell it's Gemma's
birthday go all out and yeah I think I'm
gonna wear this and there's a cos it
because here definitely would not be
undone but I think the line is quite
flattering because that's kind of my
smallest part I need to do my makeup as
well I can't really be bothered to start
from scratch I don't really think I need
to so I'm just gonna add some concealer
and am I gonna wear bright lip I think
I'm gonna do heavy eye you keep the lip
quite new coz weeks from dinner
copyable to reapply that is
plan I've got for this eyeshadow on top
of what I was already wearing I think
this is wood winked very pretty gold and
I think that's Cork in the crease and
underneath the eye and I'm gonna find
something like black liquid liner and I
should be alright oh I'm gonna try my
Kat Von D new black liquid liner the
tattoo you going there I'm gonna wear my
new Kate Spade necklace which is this
one with a little L my nails Revlon
vixen and I put some of Mac patisserie
and a by terry lip gloss on I really
just brought my hand on my straighteners
I'm wearing a Daniel Wellington watch
which is very similar to so this is my
Acuras watch has a rose gold face but
silver bits here because it was kind of
made like I mean they changed the face
for me very similar and I think easier
to get hold of so I'll link it below
Rich's outfit of the evening looking
good great houses brushes names blue
sweatshirt ready for some good food good
company here makes me happy she makes me
up no cooler it makes me happy we're
heading over to our friends SJ and Rob's
pick them up and play a bit fifa
apparently but hopefully not for long
really great
today I'm feeling a little bit worse for
wear we had quite a late night but it
was so much fun
karaoke was hilarious but I really lost
my voice it's only now coming back today
I'm taking Bailey to a little kind of
film premiere I got a few tickets to see
Nativity 3 which is like a kid's
Christmassy type film and I think
there's gonna be some like fun and
Christmasy stuff going on at Leicester
Square
so me and rich are gonna take him on the
tube which I think he will find very fun
because he doesn't go on the cheap that
offer my thing he's only been a few
times and we're gonna meet my sister
Jojo there so probably not going to be
our favor of film ever but I think I'll
be a nice memory for baby and he'll have
fun going into town with me and rich
what was your favorite bet did it make
you wanna cry I don't know and that was
very cute I mean the film wasn't my cup
of tea but Bailey loved a he's 5 and he
was just smiling the whole way through
and it's really cute because he like
properly watches films now and
understands the story so there was one
part where it was really sad and then it
got like happy sad he was rubbing his
face and I said are you okay he said I
feel like I'm gonna cry too
they were so cute I don't I think he had
the best day but those are like freebies
and there was like popcorn on our seats
and he loved it so we've just got an
Indian takeaway which I'm very happy
about we're gonna eat that watched X
Factor and chill out because I am
exhausted and sitting in a cinema lots
of kids it's not the best cure for a
hangover so hope you guys have enjoyed
this week's vlog and I think I'll be
vlogging again next week hopefully

be exhausting but I think if I'm gonna
