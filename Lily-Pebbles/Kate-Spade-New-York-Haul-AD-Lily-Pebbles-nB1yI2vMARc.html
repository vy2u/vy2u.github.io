today's video is a collaboration with
Kate Spade New York and I was so honored
when they asked me to work with them and
I'm so excited to be sharing this video
with you guys they invited me into their
Regent Street store to introduce me to
their new handbag which is called the
Hemsley and to their Broome Street
collection if they're in the morning
looking around the store trying on stuff
it is so beautiful in there so I really
enjoyed like filming clips and having a
little look around they then asked me if
I'd like to pick out some pieces and
star them up into outfits to show you
guys in this video it really is every
girl's dream and I loved the entire
experience I'm gonna talk me through all
the pieces I picked up tops dresses
shoes I got so many different things but
first of all let's take a look back at
this morning when I was in The Regent
Street store
I've got so many amazing pieces so I'm
gonna talk you through them all and then
show you guys cutaways of how I would
style them starting with this top this
is like a slightly fancy take on a basic
white tee from the top it just looks
like a white t-shirt with simple sleeves
but it has this really nice cutout
circle detail on the sides and then it
kind of frills out the bottom a little
bit like a peplum I get a bit bored of
where I'm plain white t-shirt so this is
something a little bit different and I
think this would look really nice with
just some blue denim jeans this top is
part of the Broome Street collection I
think it's one of the first things I
picked up it just looks like something I
will get so much wear out of for this
outfit I wanted to give it a little bit
of a summer holiday theme so I'm gonna
wear it with jeans and then wear some
flip-flops as well although I live in a
city when it's nice and sunny we often
go to parks on the weekend to have
picnics so it's always good to have some
flip-flops to hand these I see the first
of all can I show you the shoe box this
is the cutest shoe box ever pink and
orange and it says Kate Spade in gold
their packaging is so beautiful it makes
the whole shopping experience so much
better so these are what the flip-flops
look like they're like a bluey green
they've got this really cool palm tree
print and then a gold strap I love God
and I love the color combination of
these and it also says on the flip flops
I need a vacation
we obviously don't use the word vacation
in the UK but we all know what it means
we call a holiday you guys call it
vacation and I think this outfit goes
really well with the whole campaign that
Kate Spade of running at the moment the
campaign is called vacation as a state
of mind and it's all about how you don't
actually have to go on holiday to fill
out your own holiday and I feel like
these flip-flops are a great example of
that and to go with the flip-flops jeans
and white t-shirts I also picked this
bag and I absolutely love it I don't
think beach bags have to just be for the
beach if you haven't got a summer
holiday planned I feel like we can get
so much use out of a beach bag you can
take it to a picnic or just use it as a
handbag they're so handy this has got
really like sturdy straps and a good
base as well so it stands by itself it's
blue stripy I love stripes
it says Broome Street Kate Spade on here
and then it says escape the ordinary and
I just think this is so cute you
definitely don't have to just use this
for a beach trip so I'm really looking
forward to wearing that this summer and
I think it looks really nice with the
white t-shirt jeans and flip-flops
they're very kind of summery outfit okay
onto outfit number two and I saw this
striped top straightaway
Kate Spade do so many different stripes
and you guys know I'm obsessed with
strike so I was
okay with that this is a top and it's
slightly wider on the neck that I think
is really nice three-quarter length
sleeves black and white so I feel though
it kind of looks blue in some lights
maybe it is blue I'm not sure and this
one it just looks playing on the front
but then on the back it has these little
frills that pop out and I think it makes
it look a little bit different a little
interesting and it's really flattering
on I absolutely love wearing stripes in
the spring and summer and again I would
wear this with blue jeans just to make
it a little bit more casual I also
picked up this little jacket to go on
top with the striped top and it fits
perfectly and I think I'm gonna get so
much use out of this because you can
just wear on top of a t-shirt with jeans
you can kind of wear it casual or wear
it with a dress to look a little bit
smarter it's a white jacket and it's got
two little pockets it's kind of frayed
around the edges it's so nice it's
really like textured I tried it on and
it really suited me and I fell in love
with it especially wearing it with the
stripy top I feel like that's a really
me look I love that on the label it says
Kate Spade New York look for the silver
lining like the details in the clothes
it just makes it so special to go with
this outfit I got to pick out one in the
Hemsley bags and I think they come in
four colors black navy blue and then the
shade that I went for which is kind of
like a stone gray I think this is really
nice the bags quite a different shape
than anything else I've seen it's quite
big but I think it's really nice as a
crossbody or just to wear on one
shoulder it has stripes inside which
makes me very happy and it's got two
pockets anas it and I also like that it
has these little tassels on the side I
think lighter leather bags are really
great for the spring summer because I
have so many black bags but I think this
automatically lightens up your outfit
it's very easy to wear it also has a
little Kate Spade in gold at the front
and it has a pocket on the front which
is really handy especially for my
notebook and for shoes I actually picked
out some very special shoes because I'm
gonna be wearing these for the evening
part of my wedding so when my feet start
hurting and I don't want to wear heels
anymore I'm going to change into these
shoes and I've had my eye on them for so
long so I'm so happy to have them there
from Kate Spade but there is a
collaboration with kids let me just open
this box to show you guys I haven't
actually shown much wedding stuff so I
feel like this is pretty exciting right
now this is what they look like so
they're little trainers with their like
silk ribbon laces
they're silver and glittery and I think
they are amazing they're absolutely
perfect for like the evening part of my
wedding when I just want to like let
loose and dance but I also think these
are so nice for summer as well wearing
them with jeans or little dresses I
think will look really cute and it's not
an annoying little II feel it's gonna
come off it's very much like stuck on
the shoe and they're so so comfortable I
tried them on in store and I loved them
so happy I got them so these shoes are
gonna finish off that outfit number two
so now I have three dresses to show you
and I feel like a good summer dress is
so important whether you're staying at
home you're having picnics and barbecues
if you've got engagement parties I
actually have a couple of weddings
abroad so I feel like having a good
collection of summer dresses is key
first one is black with Daisy prints on
it I absolutely love this what I love
about this dress is that its high neck
so it's really flattering I will have to
find a bra that works with this dress
but I really like this high neck and
then it does up with a little bow at the
back it cinches in at the waist and then
just drops and it's a maxi dress which
means that you can wear flats and be
comfortable I think this would work for
a summer wedding but it would also work
just for like a barbecue picnic or
whatever occasion you have in the summer
it's very light and comfortable it's not
like a sweaty material or anything like
that and I also think with a little
jacket it would look really nice I'm
just I love it
oh it says look for the silver lining
maybe they all say that so nice so I
think that would be my summer maxi dress
of the year has a little bumblebees on
it as well and then the other two
dresses I got a definitely more occasion
a bit smarter this one is black blue and
white definitely my three favorite
colors
it's a sleeveless dress and it has this
slight cutout detail at the front which
is great if you have slightly bigger
boobs cinches in at the waist and then
it kind of goes out I don't normally
wear dresses in that shape but I tried
this on it was really flattering I love
the three colors I love that it's quite
a bright blue I think this would work
really well for a wedding I think this
would work well for all different kinds
of summer events it's very comfortable
to wear as well I also found that I'm
normally in between a size 10 and 12 but
I fit it into the 10 and most things in
Kate Spade's so they do fit really
nicely I would just wear that dress with
little black heels and a handbag and I
really really love it and then the next
dress I think I'm definitely gonna wear
this to a wedding I have in France in
July I don't normally go for this style
dress but it it really flattered my body
shape and I really like it it's
sleeveless
and it's got a peach white and black
floral theme going on and it's kind of
just goes kind of straight and then
stops just above the knee and I just
think it's really pretty it's like the
perfect wedding guest dress I think
would look really nice little handbag
point where a little jacket over the top
as well it does go in a little bit at
the waist but it's just a very different
shape for me and I really like it I
tried it on and just thought yeah
straight away that's perfect
the floral detail is really gorgeous and
I think it makes it very special so that
everything I picked up from the Kate
Spade New York Regent Street store let
me know what your favorite piece was I
absolutely loved everything I got and
I'm so excited to wear them if you
