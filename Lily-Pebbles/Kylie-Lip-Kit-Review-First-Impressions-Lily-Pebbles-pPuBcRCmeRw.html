doing a review video on the Kylie Jenner
lip kits very exciting stuff there's
gonna be so much information in this
video I'm going through different
categories on like the ordering process
the formula the packaging my thoughts
swatches so please wait for the end to
leave a comment and then I'm gonna be
really interested to hear what you guys
think a little backstory for those of
you who are thinking who is Kylie Jenner
and what the hell is the lip kit Kylie
Jenner is one of the younger daughters
at the Kardashian clan and there's been
a huge hype around her new lip kits
which are her new liquid lipstick
release there's always been a huge press
attention around her and her lips
because she grew up having very thin
lips she ended up having a lip job and
now she has these amazing huge lips and
I think she's always been obsessed with
lipstick and lip products I follow her
on snapchat and I'm a bit obsessed with
Kardashian's really which is so out of
character for me but I just love them so
I was really kind of into this whole lip
kit launch thing i sat back at first and
then I kind of became obsessed so they
launched in America online and the
reason I was first attracted to the
range of because of the shades I really
like the kind of nudie tone shades that
she came out with so let me start by
talking about the ordering process and
the delivery these lip kits are really
hard to get hold up because they're so
high in demand I think they set the
first time they sold out in like 30
seconds and there are a lot of people
all around the world really worn them so
I followed Kylie cosmetics on Twitter I
follow Kylie Jenner herself on snapchat
and there are a few Instagram accounts
that you can follow as well that give
updates on when they're gonna release
them online they basically tell you a
time they're gonna be released it's
normally about four o'clock in LA which
is really annoying because it's midnight
in the UK and then you have to just
prepare put it in your diary and get
ready for that kind of time so the first
time I ordered these I was already at
midnight to order all of my lip kits and
I didn't realize that they were just
releasing Kourt K that day so when I
finally got on the website and realized
the other colors weren't available I was
so annoyed that I just ordered Kourt K
which isn't really a color I would have
necessarily bought originally but I'll
get onto that later so my first order
was just for one lip kit and then the
week later they did it again on a Monday
night at midnight and I ordered three
shades I didn't manage to get coke okay
I think that's the fastest sell out
every time it's a really nice kind of
soft pink but I did manage to get candy
Posey K and dulcis came my tips for
getting the lip kit would be to have an
account already set up on the website as
soon as the times already you just have
to keep refreshing add it to your basket
and just literally keep refreshing I
managed to do it I think it's getting
easier and easier every time because she
knows how many people now are interested
they have enough stop she's also
recently added some lip glosses and
metallic lip creams but I'm not really
interested in those so this is how the
lip kits arrive they come in a box that
looks like this and it was a bit of
inconsistency with delivery package one
of them came with it or card inside that
said like from Kylie and the other one
didn't have that this is the little card
you get inside with the lips on the
front and then it says on the other side
hey guys thank you thank you for the
love and support I promise I will keep
bringing beautiful quality products to
you guys I've got some surprises in
store Kylie that's quite nice a little
personal touch the price of the lip kits
are $29 so that's a price for a lip
liner and a liquid lipstick which I will
show you in a minute that's around 20
pounds for us so that alone is pretty
standard price for a really good liquid
lipstick we do however have to pay
$14.95 ship to the UK so that's an extra
10 pound 50 I then found that the parcel
of mine that only had one lip kit in it
I had to pay tax on top so there's
obviously funny to do with how much you
spend that that pass have got held at my
local Depot and I had to pay 12 pounds
so in total that package cost me 42
pound 50 these lip kits are not worth 42
pound 50 for the package where I ordered
3 ends up paying 20 pounds each lip kit
and then 10 pound 50 and total for all
of those three to be delivered in that
case I would say it's worth it so I've
got my boxes delivered let me open them
up and show you guys what they look like
inside they just open up like this oops
and then there's this is Kylie inside
and there's a caddy and stuff and then
the lip kits are all in here so this is
what one of the lip kits look like sin a
little kind of rectangular box which i
think is really cute I definitely think
the whole lip kit thing is all for
marketing purposes I personally find
that with a liquid lips that you don't
need a lip liner so it's definitely not
necessary but I completely understand
why she did it it makes it way easier to
advertise and do marketing because it's
a lip kit which is just more exciting
than a liquid lipstick but I don't think
the
Linna is actually necessary so on the
back it has Kylie's like autograph and
it says Kylie's tips which I found
really funny because it just says line
the lips of lip liner and fill in the
lips with a liquid lip color which I
thought was pretty self-explanatory but
anyway it has all the ingredients on the
back and I really like the imagery I
think it's very kind of appealing and
exciting I love her logo all of that
stuff I think is great
well well on the topic of packaging I'll
talk through the packaging of the
products the lip liner looks like this
and although it looks like the sort of
lip line maybe you can't sharpen you can
actually just use a normal sharpener for
this so that's pretty standard lip liner
packaging and then the liquid lipstick
pretty basic packaging from the outside
nothing that fancy it's not like the
Anastasio one that I think feels like
it's really high-quality I'd say this
actually feels quite cheap looks cool
quite young looking with the like melted
paint thing but fine
like I prefer just the standard basic
packaging than anything fancy what I did
notice straight away is that when you
pull out the dough for applicator
there's no suction there and I don't
know if you know what I mean by that by
that but normally there's something
inside that kind of takes the product
off and there's absolutely nothing I
don't if she did that on purpose or if
it's a bit of a cheap way to make the
product but it doesn't mean that you do
have to take a bit of the product off
yourself if you find this too much when
you apply this is the only liquid
lipstick I own that doesn't have that
kind of suction thing so that's a bit
strange so those are my thoughts on the
packaging so let me talk you through the
shades that I got and then I will talk
to you more about formula and how
long-lasting it is and all of that so
the lightest shade that I picked up is
the one I'm wearing now which is Kandy K
this was the one I was most desperate
for because I really loved nude colored
liquid lipsticks the lip line is pretty
much the same color as my natural lip
color and the liquid lipstick dries a
little bit darker all the shades dry
darker than they look in the tube which
is a bit disappointing but that's quite
common with liquid lipsticks
because this is so similar to my natural
lip color it fades quite well because
there isn't like a really sudden line
where you can see my lips underneath and
I think this is a really nice everyday
shade this is definitely my favourite
one out of all the colors that I got the
next shade I got is Dolce K which is
definitely more of a brown if you have
darker skin tone like Kylie it looks
more of an
on me it's quite a dark-brown it's
different to anything else I have it's
quite on trend which I like but it's
definitely a statement lip I walked on
the weekend and I felt like it was a bit
out there it's probably more something I
would wear in the evening but a really
cool Brown without being too Brown she
has a shape called true Brown which
would be far too dark for me the next
one I got this pose ek and I really like
this it's like a berry move color it
reminds me a lot of Mac syrup if machs
it was really pigmented really
flattering I think this sort of berry
shades really suit me I could wear this
during the day or in the evening I love
this one this is probably my second
favorite after candy cane I think it
looks really pretty on the lips and I'm
really happy I picked this one the final
show they've got is caught Kay and as I
said I only got this because I stayed up
to a midnight to order and didn't
realize that the other shades wouldn't
be available so I kind of got it just
because I wanted to get something and I
do regret it because I don't love the
shade it's a really dark purple which is
really pretty on the lips I do find it a
little bit too dark for me and because
it's so contrasting with the color of my
lips you can really see when it fades on
the inside I'll talk more about that
later but I just found the shade didn't
apply that well it was a bit streaky and
not massively impressed with Port K so
let me talk to you about the formula and
application the first thing I did as
soon as I got these lip kits was applied
them onto the back of my hand
and I could tell that after about a
minute it had really dried and I've
since timed it and it does take like
pretty much a minute to dry out and then
set on the lips so I kind of got my
finger and rubbed it on the back of my
hand and they didn't move at all and I
thought let's just see what happens if I
run my hand under the tap so I left my
hand under the hot tap hot water quite a
while then got a tissue robbed my hand
and they didn't budge or fade at all so
I was really really impressed straight
off at the kind of longevity but then I
wanted to see how they felt on my lips
because usually things that are really
long-lasting are also really drying the
lip liners are really creamy and
actually I think they were a little bit
too creamy because by the time you've
lined your entire lips you kind of need
to sharpen the pencil which is a bit
annoying I find I don't mind when lip
liners are a little bit hard I like them
when they're kind of in the middle these
are a little bit too creamy but they are
really nice and it means you can also
wear the lip liners alone if you want to
as I said before I really don't think
lip liners and necess
wearing liquid lipstick so it's a bit of
a gimmick to have them together but
because they're so creamy it means that
you can really push to the edge of your
lips and you can make them bigger if you
want to the liquid lipstick itself is
the most watery and thin consistency out
of any of the liquid lipsticks I have it
applies really kind of smooth and sheer
and I do think it takes a couple of
layers to get it really opaque it then
takes a minute to dry and when it dries
it completely sets in place just in the
middle of doing the lip swatches and I
remember that I forgot to tell you guys
that one I hate the scent is so vanilla
and sickly it really makes me feel ill
it's so too sweet for me I really don't
like it all of the colors I got applied
really nicely apart from court K which
did apply streaky once it dried it
didn't look streaky as I said it did
fade a bit funny on the inside of my
lips I didn't exfoliate my lips before
using any of them and I didn't find that
it clung to much and the dry patches of
my lips I wouldn't say it's a hydrating
liquid lipstick but it's definitely not
the most drying I've tried it doesn't
feel uncomfortable on the lips either I
actually did a first impressions kind of
video clip where I wore one of the
liquid lipsticks all day and filmed
throughout the day to see how it faded
from morning to evening and obviously
all the shades will be different I used
Kandy K for this one so I'm gonna insert
the clips now and show you guys how it
lasted throughout the day I've just
applied the lip liner and liquid
lipstick it's quarter past 11:00 in the
morning
excuse my cold sounding voice I'm not
feeling great and I'm not looking great
but the lipstick looks really good so
I'm gonna see how it lasts throughout
the day and how it changes and I'll
update you guys it's been an hour since
I applied it and I think it feels really
comfortable it doesn't feel heavy or
drying on the lips at all it's
definitely more Creasy on me than it
looks on Kylie because we all know she
has lip fillers so it really kind of
plums them out Mason
smoother but it is smooth compared to
some of my other liquid lipstick
I think it looks really nice I'm now
heading to my sisters and we're gonna
have soup for lunch and I'm gonna do
lots of bread dipping so that'll be a
good test to see how it last it's
quarter past one
I just finished lunch I had soup ham
cheese chutney bread I ate quite a lot
and it's still going strong if I open my
mouth the inside it's rubbed off
slightly like there but I mean not at
all I did I don't need to retouch it
definitely not that is amazing compared
to my other liquid lipsticks it hasn't
come off at all so I'm very impressed
with that I'm just about to drink coffee
so we'll see how it lasts after a
company that's had my coffee and things
are definitely changed like here you can
see this bits kind of fading a bit away
wearing it but when I get back to the
car I'm going to try like reapply and
see it's quarter past four and I am so
impressed how this lipstick has lasted
it feels if I don't look in the mirror
it feels a little bit dry on the inside
of my lips and I find myself like
licking my lips quite a bit but you
can't really tell it if you look really
really close so I'm just gonna top it up
a little bit just in the inside of my
lips and see how it layers so I've just
topped up and you can see that's part of
it still hasn't dried yet but hopefully
when it dries it all the color would
smash together it's now half seven so
the lipsticks been on pretty much all
day I don't think I would expect any
lipstick to last longer than this and
it's definitely drying out a bit in the
inside and flaking quite a bit starting
to feel a little bit uncomfortable like
my it's kind of sticking together my
tongue is catching it but not bad at all
and because this is candy case it's one
of the shades that's quite similar to my
own lip color it's not that obvious when
you're looking at me the darker shades
it may be more obvious I'm not sure yet
but it's definitely not uncomfortable I
feel like if I reapplied now it would
look absolutely fine so I'm really
really impressed that how long is lost I
think I'm gonna head home now and
probably take it off but if I was going
out tonight I think I could reapply it
to the inside of my lips and it would be
fine very impressed with the darker
shades I found that towards the end of
the day they did get quite dry inside of
my lips and what I found the best thing
to do then was to take a tissue rock off
the kind of excess dry flaky parts of my
lips and reapply I actually found that
reapplying the lipstick worked really
well with my sealer ones when I
reapplied it just got worse and worse
more drying and more flaky with these
ones I found that you can actually
reapply and layer them and it works
really well now when it comes to how
these compare to others something I keep
seeing in my comments and tweets is
these are just repackaged color pop
lipsticks but it's important to note
that we can't get color pop here in the
UK there's no way unless you do one of
those dodgy things where you buy it from
weird websites but I'm not really
interested than that
the fact that I stayed up late to order
these and paste shipping from America
it's very rare for me I don't really
tend to do that the only time I order
things online from another country is if
I'm on Sephora because if you spend over
a certain amount you don't have to pay
shipping and that's actually it I only
ever order from Sephora so even to pay
$14.95 on viously I wanted to do a video
on it and I really wanted to try them
but we don't have color pop we don't
have Oprah I would love to try the color
pop ones but I can't so I can't really
say how they compare to the color pop
ones and whether these are so expensive
and they're just the same formula
because those physically unavailable to
us here in the UK I'd say these are most
similar to the stealer liquid lipstick
but the sealer ones really vary
depending on the shade batchi I really
love and I'd say that's quite similar
but then some of the darker shades I
really didn't like from Stila are they
worth spending that much money on and
staying up till midnight it's hard for
me to say I'm a beauty blogger I make
videos on makeup so for me it is worth
it because I'm making a video for you
guys and I get to try these new products
but for your average consumer I don't
know I think if you I think if there's
like three shades you like so you don't
have to pay that tax then it probably is
worth doing a one-off order I do think
they are the best liquid lipsticks I've
tried I really love this Kandy K shade I
really like doll cheek as well and I
think if I know someone that's gonna
make another order I'm gonna ask them to
get me Coco Kate as well because I
really want to try that I like you can
put her on and off to worry about it
coming off I ate some really like oily
foods and they didn't move at all and
they didn't make me want to like rip my
lips off of my face
I think she's done a really good job and
it's really fun if you follow her and
snapchat and you get to see the factory
and behind the scenes I think it feels
quite fun to be a part of it and order
the products and get excited about it I
do think the lip kit thing is quite a
gimmick because once you get them you're
gonna take them out the package in
anyway and then you've just got a lonely
lip liners
liquid lipsticks when I would have been
happy with just the liquid lipsticks I
feel like I've gone on for quite a while
now about these liquid lipsticks so I'm
gonna stop if I haven't covered any area
or I haven't answered a question you
might have please leave me a comment
down below and I'll let you know how
they feel how the ordering process was
who I followed on Instagram to find out
when they go live anything like that
just ask me I'll let you guys know and I
hope you like this video I hope it was
helpful let me know if you have any of
the other shades and what you think of
them and thank you so much for watching
