la style who have kindly sent me an ANA
out here to go to VidCon which is on the
weekend and we've got a week full of
plans I literally can't wait with him
he's shot live meeting up with loads of
youtubers we have some photo shoots and
interviews planned and then VidCon on
the weekend so it took a long time to
get here we're feeling a little bit
peaky this morning but I'm so excited
for the week ahead I'm doing two vlogs
for you part 1 and part 2 so I hope you
guys will enjoy that
we've come to the farmers market and the
Grove to have a little look around
they we're gonna go look at American
girls it's so funny in here creepy
somewhere I always have to visit when I
come to America is The Container Store
so we're heading there now
Fanny organizers who are literally in
our happy place it's incredibly humid
even though the Sun isn't out so we got
a Jamba Juice I got a peach beauty one
to cool me down with Gia and a line
in the UK for some reason is impossible
to find unsalted dry roasted almonds and
my best friend Gemma is obsessed with
them so whenever we come to America I
always get some for her she always gets
like moments in New York she literally
bought back to ten boxes they're so good
so we're heading to Whole Foods to see
if we can find some and probably some
other stuff too I've already done quite
a bit of shopping for it too made well
and the container store and I'm a happy
bunny right now when Whole Foods and
what rich some of the Justin's
peanut butter because we can't really
get that at home and I think we know for
lunch now my uncle sent me a huge list
of recommendations of where to eat and
one of them is UNAMI burger which is in
the grove so I think we're gonna head
there and have a burger for lunch we're
just trying not such a rule until you
see London just crossing the road we're
over here you get in trouble here so
we're
so I just had was possibly the best
burger I've ever had in my life at you
know me no not me bouhanni
tsunami tsunami burger I think it's
called it's like Japanese fusion with
burgers which is my dream it was
incredible with definitely recommend
going there and Anna had like a tuna
burger so we're gonna head back to the
head start a quick makeup touch-up
because we're gonna go meet the people
from blog lobby now and I don't really
know what we're doing but I think it's
like a mini interview and then they can
take a few photos of us and that will be
put on the blog loving website so
whenever I get the link to that I'll
tweet it or put it in the description
box up this video and I'm excited or be
fun we're meeting in Joan's on third
which looks like a very trendy place
this is Johan yeah he writes a blog
lovely so we've just been chatting for
two hours really

our love for Apple and we're gonna go
find somewhere nice States and photos
because it's a pretty golden hour and
I'm on my second iced tea and lemonade
and lovin apologies that yesterday's
vlog ended pretty abruptly
I think jet like seriously kicked in and
I didn't realize I was that bad with jet
lag but I got really really sick and
from about 6 p.m. until 10:30 I was
lying in bed running to the toilet I
thought was gonna be sick just felt
really really really ill it's a little
bit funny now but much better than I did
last night I was actually sitting on the
floor there in front of the toilet just
like crying and its really scared of
people being sick so but she wasn't the
other room with her headphones on and I
don't deal well with being sick I like
need my mommy me and me so the last
night was a bit of a disaster we didn't
have dinner and I just felt terrible I
was more worried you know I can deal
with feeling ill but I was really
worried that tonight when it's obvious
our life I'm gonna feel the same so I
just really really really hope I don't
have crossing my fingers very tight
