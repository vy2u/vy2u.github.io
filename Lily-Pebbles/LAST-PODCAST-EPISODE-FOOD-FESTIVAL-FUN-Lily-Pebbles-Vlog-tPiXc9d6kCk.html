this is the first time I'm vlogging this
week we had the gleam summer party
earlier on in the week and I just
thought everyone has to be vlogging that
and then it took me like a day to
recover
and then I've just been doing work but
today I thought would be a good day to
flog because I'm actually heading to
Brighton today where I upload this vlog
it will be Wednesday which means that
our final number 10 episode of our
podcast at home with would be up and
today I'm going to Brighton to record it
with Zoe thunk I really can't wait Anna
and I've known Zoe for maybe like five
six years so I think we're really nice
to God sorry my computer just came on I
think we're really nice to have a chat
with someone that look friend and also
she's just moved so I just can't wait to
go and have a little nosy around a new
home so I'm going to get ready and then
I'm going to drive down to Brighton I
think we going to have some lunch
together and then the sound guys going
to turn up you've got a new sound guide
for this episode so I think of course it
will go as well and then we're going to
do a little chat with Zoe and then I'm
going to come home I've just
straightened my hair I need to put some
waves into it and I'm going to do my
makeup now I do my makeup here behind me
so I will try and show you the products
that I'm using one day I hope to have a
beauty desk but for now I stand in front
of these drawers and do my makeup here
in this mirror I don't always like it
cosmetics CC cream but I have been using
a few new products recently this
concealer from milk I mentioned it in my
whole mind you who I really really like
that else is new the caramel eyeshadows
- Thursday I really like that mmm
anything else new in here I really will
enjoy in the Urban Decay Naked heat
palette which is in there somewhere
whistling using next which is the Bobbi
Brown illuminating moisture balm
I think I'm just going to keep things
very fresh and glowy and light it's
going to be a very hot day today and I'm
gonna be sitting in a car for like an
hour and a half two hours so not too
much makeup I don't think because it's
so weird I really really like this
concealer but there's like hardly any
put up in it and I take this out the
dose that has like hardly any product in
it and when I look inside the tube it's
really like nothing in there it's very
very strange and it wasn't a tester when
we go and interview people for the
podcast we usually take a little iPad
with us
document just kind of outlines the
format of the episode and a few topic
ideas that we want to discuss we don't
kind of set questions before but just
give ourselves a guideline we actually
normally don't really tend to look at it
but it's just a bit of a comfort blanket
for us that if we feel like we're
running out of conversation or we're not
sure how to move on to the next room
then we've got the kind of transitions
and topic ideas on the iPad so I'm just
going to finish up that document now and
put up my iPad so I can take it with me
to Bryson on a separate note I want to
ask you guys I want to do another Q&amp;amp;A
and I quite like it when I have a topic
to discuss rather than just like in
anything Q&amp;amp;A so I think my next one I
want to do it a QA on friendship so if
you guys have any questions or even if
not of questions as more like a topic do
you want me to discuss please pause this
video now and leave a comment down below
because then I can collect them all and
I don't really ask the questions and
stuff on Twitter and Instagram but then
I realize that you guys are usually the
one watching the video so I want you to
be able to ask the questions so the Q&amp;amp;A
on friendship please leave your
questions and topics down below I just
put on this red lip which is the glossy
er zip lipstick first time I've tried it
and I really like it because it's so
easy and comfortable to wear it's very
light and but it's kind of a little bit
matte but not the tool drying so that
would go well with my white dress this
dress is from mango I don't know how hot
it's going to be today it was very hot
yesterday but it's definitely getting
sunny today I think this is OK and even
my Steve Madden slides which I don't if
they go that they're just so comfy I
can't stop wearing them just had a
little phone call with Anna frost
quickly talk through things make sure
everything maghreb quite on the same
page and stuff and we were saying it's
so weird like because we've known Zoe
for so long it's going to be very funny
like interviewing her but hopefully
we'll just make it really like children
chat okay I'm ready to leave and I'll
see you guys when I get frightened must
put sunglasses on I'm at Zoe's now issue
hello and look we just got Domino's oh
my god YUM kombucha
I've left Zoe's now this lipstick
although I like it really
it's very hard to reapply so like a
little bit crazy anyway that was so nice
I didn't love much sorry because we were
just chatting loads because he had to
put across a record and then we were
chatting and we had lunch so I couldn't
actually do much blogging really
although though it's in mind this is so
nice I can't wait for you guys to hear
it where you're going to hear it today
if you want to download it it's already
up on Wednesday so let us know what you
think can't believe it's the last one

we just thought home had to take my bra
off pretty immediately because we've
been eating a lot of food today and I've
got inside pajamas and I went to my
mom's with some tassels on the way home
because she messaged me to save but lots
of stuff here so come and get it so I
thought I'd show you what I got
alright you can do the district sure in
the background I got a big bag from
Chanel which is exciting I wasn't
expecting a Chanel parcel I always want
to keep speeds and like use them in my
hair see what they've said oh my god
like a massive even know what this is
I'm at like a massive book is stretchers
in it with the Masters photo book excuse
the sound in the background which is
unloading the dishwasher appliances to
the book are some images like details of
all the thought collection is it
4-minute travel diary for 2017 but in
here
they always give us up a zip bag that
has the press release in it and the
press release has all the details
unlike release dates and prices and
Chanel always do really nice ones like
this is like normally you just get piece
of paper
oh my god cute little like stationary
things love that and then it has all the
information on the product this is kind
of more for like journalists because
they need all of those like specific
details of magazines whereas we kind of
just have to try them and until you guys
update but it's always nice to have so
this is how the products come in it's
like
little Chanel bags so many products here
I'm going to go through all of these now
I'm probably going to look through this
in my own time and then whatever I fall
in love with if I fall in love with
anything I will change into you guys in
a video or Instagram or something like
that so those are all the products
businesses there's always loads in a
Chanel collection so if you look at
those in a minute and some bits that
stand out to me this is going to be a
really knowing video with all that
Malaysia's a net you know do know what's
in this bag this is from a PR agency
called Kilpatrick Oh real technique
stuff this is exciting
I knew that they have a new collection
called powder blue powder blur and this
is the plush powder puff not sure if I
use powder puffs but I know there's some
other stuff in here too oh look how cute
these are looks and then Nick as well on
the other side I'd love that
the oh my god Wow look they come in this
like little velvet pouches LP these are
like super super soft
says premium real techniques that
sparked that premium range designed to
help you layer on powders and create
long-lasting beauty looks so there's a
massive massive brush on my brother so
soft and then I think these are probably
what good interesting more this one
would be great for like powder concealer
eye shadow oh my god they will say LP on
them that's so exciting
this one's like a massive cut oh my god
virtually oh my god oh that's waiting
don't man oh my god my all more you do
that like right I mean you get me can
you do that at no time no this is like a
smaller one on the biggest contour
powder and then that's more like a
buffing one these feel so nice oh my god
I can't wait to try those out properly
that's only going one I wouldn't use
these for a very on my street
it feels such good quality Real
Techniques are just the best brush brand
by far brush rush brand that's hard to
say what else have I got
then scientific e is my strength
Oh sensitivity what the hell is this
what oh my god it's like flow so
sympathy is our strength
I mean can you see that I mean I like
that as a bit of an artwork
I'm sure sensitivity is my strength
right what is it that open up this pack
sometimes open things that take you for
a while to figure out what it actually
is
Oh some long calm okay so this is a new
genifique sensitive theorem makes sense
now there's some more like bits in here
sensitivity not sensitivity is my
strength and then this is the theorem
very funky looking that's the bottle
very cool looking and then I love like
dropper pipette thing with it okay cool
I've also got a box here whoo
I was this is from lots of hands at
first when you guys watch this video I'm
actually going to be in South France
with l'occitane I can't way I'm going on
a little trip for them and Anna and
Naomi I think we're going to be vlogging
it so I think this is the itinerary yeah
so this tells me what we are going to
begin giving up to and I think this
picture is a hint I am terrified I heard
about the top of the balloon ride
and I know I'm very lucky to get to go
on a hot balloon yeah 5:30 in the
morning so hot glued at the hot air
balloon same thing oh my god this looks
so nice they can you look at this
properly a bit get a hot air balloon
but if you think also sent me a rule it
was them it's my son gift
sometimes things are these little
unboxing things make me look like a
right old spoiled wherever and then ask
for any of these things I'm very lucky
this is oh cool oh my god it is so cool
no son Kyson
sniff since my turn miss my sense it's
like a little on par four things first I
love this yellow really
fine and it says bon voyage French oh
it's got like those if you're possible
there ticket this plot look I survive I
can't go there's four slots in there so
that's so nice thank you look sad oh
there's lots of tissue in there that's
so cool then the other part that is the
time your birth stuff that I've already
showed you guys really excited about I'm
going to look at my itinerary now and
see what I'm getting up to you next week
very excited so I hope you liked my
little p.o box unboxing in my pajamas
that's all so now need to stop saying
that at the end of vlogging clips well
this is so crazy I just figured out how
to open it and when I clicked it down
it's like blue stuff like all went into
the serum that is very cool do I shake
it up we should have it's instruction so
guys this is the Chanel collection I
just got it all out and there's a really
nice bronzy and cream eyeshadow this is
the quad that color is very special it's
a beautiful kind of aqua blue and this
is quite different for Chanel it's a
conceal highlight in color kit then
they've been doing these double sided
brushes I got a dip another one recently
this is like a I think it's with an
cedar flat brush and a fluffy brush
that's really good on these two nail
polishes this one reminds me of first
ever Chanel nail polish I ever bought a
carton of what it called but I was
obsessed with hunting it down with a
mushroom e color a really nice light
khaki green and then there's a few
lipsticks this was a beautiful summery
orange that one's good daylight which is
a nice day nude and this is one of their
like matte liquid lips not everything
awesome really nice stuff actually I
think this would be a top pick I really
like the brush these lipsticks look
lovely that nail-polish looking forward
to trying some of these bit okay I'm
going to end the vlog here because I am
