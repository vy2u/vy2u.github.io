and we are off on a little mini
adventure my cousin is getting married
in Majorca and we're literally just
going for like two days we're gonna get
there tonight Saturday night we're
coming back Monday night so I thought
I'd bring you guys with me I'm not sure
what I can vlog and what I can't but
we're going with my parents my sister Jo
Joan her husband and kids
and I haven't been that way with the
kids since they were like babies
everything I've ever been way with honey
so I'm really looking forward to like
swimming with them and playing with them
we've just been packing the bags and I
think we're ready to go
it's far from his day after lots of
drama we have arrived oh my god our
flight was so delayed our suitcase came
out on the wrong belt and then we got to
the hotel and they didn't have our
booking and half of us had to go stay in
another hotel it's been very traumatic
but we are here I'm looking forward to
some sunshine tomorrow see you then good
morning woken up early I can smell the
Sun although it's definitely meant to
thunderstorm today and it's the wedding
I feel really sorry for my cousin that
is terrible bum this year outside our
balcony Wow
oh my god there's the sea you already
see because the Sun has blinded my lens
I'm wearing this beach cover-up that I
got from ASOS it splits like this and I
really like it actually it's very kind
of lightweight and I think it's gonna be
about 30 degrees today and now we're
waiting for the kids to wake up I can't
believe we're we're up for the kids name
it's just so excited we've only got like
two days here and I just can't wait to
like play with the kids in the pool so I
want to go in the mall
could this amazing little bit of like to
see what you can jump in Richard Bayly
are already end you see fish honey
it's Pina Colada time
what's the time 10:30 honey what are you
drinking ice cream isn't seriously
strong pina coladas oh my god they're
about to do water aerobics in the same
pool
time for what's the time for the back in
our room because we need to get ready
for this wedding so I've just washed my
hair and I've got these kind of like
estee lauder eye masks on because I've
been a little bit dehydrated and I do
want my makeup to crease I always like
when you're in the Sun your makeup looks
the worst you can like see everything so
washing my hair straightening getting
get ready for the wedding I was actually
planning on filming myself getting ready
but rich wasn't here time went pretty
fast
I need to get ready so I just did my
makeup I'll actually show you a few
things that I'm wearing so I have a bit
of time now and we're in to face primer
the it cosmetics CC cream Too Faced
bronzer the bomb frat-boy blush hush
highlighter for mac love this by terry
misty rock eyeshadow bourgeois
waterproof mascara just a case of coy
benefit eyebrow stuff urban decay
concealer and the peach one really like
that and I'm not wearing those I'm
wearing the by Terry so that's the
makeup or marine and we're in Joe Malone
blackberry and BAE perfume mixed with
the lovely smell of jungle formula Vito
roll-on this is what I'm wearing this
dress is from whistles like pink black
and grey it's kind of my standard summer
wedding dress I'm also gonna be wearing
heels and my wire cell bag oh look at
her highlighter right Chloe my sister
just did my hair she did Dutch braids
going away back into a ponytail face in
summary he's put my lipstick oh my
lipstick is Rimmel lip liner in 0:18
addiction and clinic blushing hot
lipstick such a fail because my nails
are so dry my nail polish has just
peeled off so my thumb is completely
gone and this finger has like half nail
polish on it it looks ridiculous she's
ready looking good I think what I'm
going to do because this camera does not
fit in my handbag
um and I think getting a camera out and
a wedding is a bit much I might do a
little bit of snapshotting and I'm sure
they won't mind
probably not of them anyway probably of
me and my sister being really drunk so
I'll probably insert
apps from the night so if you've already
seen them but I quite like putting snaps
into my vlogs sometimes it kind of makes
the vlog make more sense so see you guys
tomorrow
it's Monday day after the wedding it was
really fun my dad my Daniel my cousin
Daniel was wearing a crazy Alexander
McQueen see it was very good the venue
was beautiful up in the mountains and
just the make amazing setting really
lovely wedding this is our last day
we're actually flying tonight so I know
a lot of you are gonna say you didn't
explore me or Kerr but I've been here
before
we'll come back when he of two days but
we're definitely gonna have a beach day
because this is the last Sun we're
getting this year so we're gonna head
over to my parents hotel and have some
breakfast morning after the wedding
oh my gosh I look so terrible
I just went paddleboarding I couldn't
vlog it there's something on my cup
involvement like expectations versus
reality I wish I was on earth people
it's go paddle boarding and film it look
amazing but I don't get my camera wet so
we ran out a pedalo and paddle board
it's really fun emergency wedding cool
just know what you want to be doing but
looks there hasn't really been anything
to blog really but I'm just put me in
the pool it's time this awesome and then
we're gonna have some dinner
me and Mitch heading back tonight and
when I say we've got a really late
flight yep so is there to be packing up
our stuff but we have a late night
flight tonight so I'm gonna pack all my
things and then we're gonna go for
dinner and just go straight to the
airport from there my lips are very soft
I put lip balm all over in case you are
wondering me and honey you're gonna play
you know it's a favorite game isn't it
but what happens when we play she always
wins
let's try again I'm gonna try and beat
you this time which I really hard okay
yeah Bailey's playing with us as well
she's also very good at you know Penny's
fine you've got two cards left so she is
winning like I said she would a three
card
who won honey is the champion of you
know Ryan my brother-in-law is rocking a
bomb back not only just a fun bag and
was it good
army print fanny pack Mike Baker we're
at the side you back
we're going to a little Italian
restaurant dinner by the port you hungry
which fancy yeah
fancy pasta but I know that it will just
end with me being obtained for my
appearance Ted
Mayon richer at the airport and there's
no one else here
hopefully the flight to 10 to 12 I
didn't even realize like went that late
pretty quiet it was like really quick to
get here we left our family at dinner
we're heading home and if I stay awake
and hope that our car is filled in Luton
because we parked in a really Dutchman
spot and I just don't think I scoffs
they're gonna be there
positive airports will always like this
I feel like we've done something wrong
easy gesture
I am now moving on to eight-hour of
green see if this will work because my
lips that just got worse and worse rich
always thinks these are called mementos
it just makes me laugh so much every
time you said that you want some
mementos what just happened I don't
understand it it's why people queue for
me already have our seats really you
just just sit for as long as you can and
then get on the plane and we are back in
London now we're just driving back from
the airport is 10:00 to 2:00 it's so
late we're gonna be so tired tomorrow
because we are really late last night as
well but I'm happy to be back looking
forward to getting back into my own bed
I hope you guys found this video a
little bit interesting turns out it
wasn't that much to vlog on the holiday
but you got a little sneak peek into our
kind of two-day trip to New Yorker and
it was so nice just to get some Sun and
the sea was an incredible it was so
clear I can't get over that kind of
little sea paddleboarding thing we did
