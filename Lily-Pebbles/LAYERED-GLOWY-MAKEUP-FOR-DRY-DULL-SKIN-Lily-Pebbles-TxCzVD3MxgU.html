watching this on a Sunday morning today
I fancy doing a makeup video which I
haven't done in so so long
I've definitely kind of veered away from
beauty videos over the past year not for
any other reason then I've just been
interested in other things but despite
not kind of hoarding new products and
new palates all the time and being
obsessed with like what's new I still
have a massive love for beauty for
makeup all things cosmetics and I
thoroughly enjoy doing my makeup
everyday I may use the same products
every single day but I still really
enjoy the process and at the moment I've
really been enjoying taking my time in
the morning and do my makeup before I go
out I've recently been trying to kind of
amp up the glow in my makeup I've got
really dry skin maybe it's not
necessarily dry or just quite dehydrated
and just very dull and flat
I found that over the last year my skin
has definitely started aging more and
I've had to put in a lot more effort to
get that kind of young fresh glowy look
in my makeup then we'll show you a
makeup look today I've been doing
recently which is the one I'm wearing
right now and it may seem like I'm using
a lot of products but what I really
enjoy doing my makeup so I like to just
take my time and do it if I can
especially on the weekend and - I
figured out that layering products to me
works really well lots of light layers
sometimes if I just do like a five put
up face I just look so flat and by the
end of the day my makeups disappear so I
do lots of layers
lots of glowy products but just very
light layers so it doesn't feel heavy
and doesn't clog up my skin so I'm going
to be showing you some glowy primers a
glowy printed moisturizer some cream
blushes liquid highlighters and I'm
going to show you how I created this
look which is kind of what I've been
wearing a lot especially over the past
two week I think in the summer when it's
warm I just want to look fresh and glowy
and I really like this makeup look I'm
just looking to my computer now to check
I still like it but I do so if you have
a bit of time on a Saturday morning and
you want to do as low a makeup look
maybe this video will help you it's been
very strange for me in a future video I
haven't done it in such a long time but
keep watching if you want to see how I
created this look to get ready to see me
there's no makeup on and I really hope
you guys enjoy this video okay the first
thing I'm going to do is
hydrate my skin I obviously did my
skincare routine this morning but before
I do my makeup I like to add another
layer of hydration this is from Trish
McEvoy it's a beauty booster cream in
SPF 30 this is an enriched primer I use
this years ago not sure where it went I
just got a new one so I'm just going to
work on the skin and that just adds
another layer of moisture for my face
I'm obviously going to use the it
cosmetics CC cream SPF 50 I just haven't
found anything else that is as glowy is
this and it's got really good coverage
because my foundation tends to just my
skin like drinks it up throughout the
day so sometimes that gets the end of
the day and it look like I'm not wearing
any foundation so this really lasts me
but it has the glow as well as the
coverage but I'm actually going to mix
it with the better fact like priming
tool so just to add a little bit more
glow how many times am I going to say
hello in this video I'm going to do one
pump of the CC cream which actually
gives quite a lot in one pump you might
want to use less and then I'm going to
do like yeah nearly one pump of the
glowy priming filter I'm going to mix
those together on at the back of my hand
and then I'm just dotting that on my
cheek it does look like a lot of product
but I really worked it into the skin so
I'm still a little bit on the back of my
hand if I want to top it up I'm going to
use my real technique I never know if
they have complexion sponge or something
like that
it's really really wet not even down
it's like soaking wet and then I just
kind of Bop it all over my face I was
just like swipe it so I get under the
chin down my neck and I really take my
time just to work this really into the
skin I think you're gonna dance punch me
just kind of sharez out the product in a
little bit I just like lift my hair to
do like the hairline so now I take
what's left on the back of my hand and
I'll probably go in a little bit around
the nose and then just keep popping away
so the CC cream is kind of like a tinted
moisturizer you don't have to really
worry about getting any edges with it
because it's just so subtle and it's so
easy to use so that is my base done as
you can see it's not really heavy cover
definitely shared it out are using the
damp sponge and by mixing it with the
primer so it's quite a nice light glowy
face but I definitely still got some
blemishes I've got my chin around my
nose and obviously my dark circles so
now going to go in with some concealer
and I've recently been using this one
from beauty pie which is kind of
complicated but I think you pay sign up
you like you pay a monthly fee and then
you get really really great products at
a very very decent price as I like cost
price so they don't add any sort of
marketing fast that makes it more
expensive but anyway they sent me this
concealer which is the super luminous
concealer and I really really like it
come from this tiny cheese and then it's
a little sponge applicator so I'm going
to use a little bit of that under my
eyes
I think this concealer has really great
coverage but it's definitely got a lot
of glow to it so it doesn't look too
heavy on life I'm certainly you can see
there's a to sheer to me that I should
do anything so this actually works but a
few spots I'm going to cover up now I
like to go in with down sponge again but
then sometimes that does share up you
can see the to much so I do go in with a
second layer sometimes but I'm going to
see see what it looks like today I think
when you do your makeup you just have to
like assess the situation as you do it
to keep looking in the mirror and use
daylight as well obviously now and in
lights but I normally go by a window I'm
using the sponge just to Pat that into
the skin it's usually under my eyes
where I need a little bit more coverage
I've always had quite dark circles it's
sort of a teenager so it makes up
artists always tell me that I don't have
dark circles but I feel like I do I also
get quite dark eyelids so I take the
concealer off of my eyelids as well and
it kind of works like a primer I'm using
the round side part of the sponge just
to make sure it's not sitting on top of
the skin and it's really sort of meshed
in with the skin such a nice concealer
so as I said I'm going to go in with a
tiny bit more just under my eyes like
one little dot and one little dot there
and then I came to use a brush just to
kind of Pat that I really need to wash
this brush it's not working as well
because it hasn't been cleaned for a
little while so that is all my
concealing done I'm really enjoying
using a concealer at the moment I know a
lot of people powder right at the end
I don't really tend to powder my skin is
only in recent years maybe the last year
that I started had to powder under my
eyes mainly because I do put so much
concealer there and are you very glowy
hydrating kind of wet concealers also
just because I'm aging I'm going into my
third few soon I get quite Creasy around
the eye area so when I'm doing a
particularly kind of hydrated glowy look
I like to take the Charlotte Tilbury
powder this is a really really fine
powder but you can hardly see it doesn't
make your skin look dry at all I take a
bit of that on the brush I need to get
smaller brush because I just use this
for my eyes and it's quite big but I
tend to just kind of swipe that under
the eye area
and that will kind of set the concealer
in place I'll do it on my eyelids as
well and I'll hopefully stop the
creasing I don't hit powder anywhere
else because I really like to look glowy
everywhere else at my face okay maybe a
bit of bronzer now and I don't want to
do too much on a key but quite fresh so
I'm going to use the body shop runs like
it's very light this is in shade 0-5 I'm
gonna take a little bit of that on the
Real Techniques point L brush which I
really really like and then I'm just
going to put that on the tops of my
cheek bone a little bit on my forehead
down my nose just kind of all over but
I'm really using very light hand and a
very small amount of product I don't
want any kind of heavy contouring going
on at this point I like to do my
eyebrows randomly I'm still using the
benefit I brought pencil and I just fill
in the front very boring I don't do
anything fancy with my brows and then
the arch where my eyebrows kind of
disappear whenever I get my eyebrows
done they always fill my eyebrows in
with a really dark pencil because my
eyebrows are dog but I actually prefer
using a sort of lighter brown just so
it's a bit softer I know it's not a
perfect match but once once it on you
can't really see and I feel that when I
use a dark pencil it's just it makes my
whole life eyebrow look a lot darker and
heavier and they're already very dark
I'm also just going to use the pixie
eyebrow clear gel run those through this
isn't like my favorite one ever but it's
just the one
at the moment my eyebrows are curly like
the rest of my hair and they're very
hard to tame before I go in with any
kind of blusher I want to glow up the
skin even more and I'm going to be using
the Charlotte Tilbury wonder glow so you
can use this as a primer but I really
like to use it as a kind of skin
highlighter I just think a little bit
onto my finger and then I Pat it on the
tops of my cheekbones and you can use
quite a bit because it's not like a
really heavy highlighter it just adds
this like dewy glow to your skin and I
really love this a little bit more on
the other side take it quite far down
and quite far up as well and then what's
less than my finger I take down my nose
and I'll put it on I keep its both so I
think you see it's not really a
highlighter it just makes the skin look
a little bit more glowy so sometimes I
put it as highlighter on top sometimes I
don't I'll see how I feel when I get to
the end of the look for my blush I'm
going to be using the glossy air is it
Garcia or glossy a glossy yeah I think
it's lost yeah I think I've been saying
it wrong for ages anyway this is the
cloud paint blush cheek color so it's a
cream blusher this is a shade dusk I
wasn't sure how I felt about this for a
while and cuz I just as you'll see it's
very sheer I took quite like it now it
goes on quite dark when I first Pat it
on the cheek I'm gonna kind of Pat it in
but then I'm going to use this brush to
blend it into my cheek so you can you
see once you blend it out it's kind of
not as scary as you think it is and it
adds a really nice like fresh color I
think I like it let me know what you
think I'm not sure maybe I've got the
wrong color but the formulas definitely
interesting this is a really great
product for taking a holiday feel like
by the pool if you like wearing makeup
by the pool very very light blusher as I
said sometimes I like to add highlighter
and sometimes I don't I think today I
will just cuz I really want to amp up
that glow I'm going to use the Becca
shimmering skin Perfector again it is
like a liquid highlighter I'm going to
put a tiny bit on my finger and I'm
going to Pat it on top of where I put
the Charlotte Tilbury this one's a bit
more of a liquid highlighter whereas the
Charlotte Tilbury one can definitely be
used as a primer for eyeshadow I'm going
to use the palette I'm holding as a
mirror
the Charlotte Tilbury look in a pallet
instant looking a pallet I'm going to
use this second shade which is the
enhanced color I'm just going to put
that all over the lid I love these
lights shimmery eyeshadows for summer
they're very fresh you hardly need
anything really really easy to apply and
then I'm going to take the third one
which is smoked and just take that on
the answer corn a little bit in the
crease just to define that a little bit
I usually take my eye shadow under my
eye as well but I feel like in the
summer if you want to like to look it's
nice just keep it on the top but I only
take a bit of this Topshop mat smoke
stick in fear which is just like a
chunky brown eyeliner but it's very
faint and you can just line the top
lashline and then you leave use your
finger or you can take a brush and just
blend that out it's really subtle
especially because it's matte very easy
to do they're not good at liner this
literally requires no skill for mascara
I've been reunited with an old favorite
I haven't used for years I went to a
clinic event this week and they gave us
a little bitty bag and in there was the
Clinique high-impact extreme volume
mascara I used to absolutely love and
rave about
so I want to see if it's still a
favorite of mine oh it's so good if you
need to wear and waterproof mascara
definitely do so in the kind of warmer
months that will help it transferring
onto your lid if some score just gives
me really long full lashes and again I'm
just keeping that in the top lashes I'm
not doing the bottom I think usually I
would just leave it there and put some
lip balm on but I'm going to use this
lipstick because I was yesterday and I
really liked it
actually before I do that I'm going to
give myself a little mist this is the
catcher luminous dewy skin mist I have
the tiniest amount less in here I'm
going to New York at the end of the
month so I'm definitely gonna pick up
another one this is as it says a dewy
skin mist it won't set your makeup
necessarily but it will just add a
little bit more glow more doing it and I
really like it it's quite oily mist just
to be aware if you have oily skin but
definitely good if you have dry skin
okay now I'm going to do my lipstick and
yesterday I tried this again from Trish
McEvoy it's the liquid
color in mows it's quite like dark for
this look maybe I'll try robbing my
finger and see what happens there just
so it's less kind of perfected I just
really like the color I'm going to do a
really light layer I'm not going to go
around the edges I'm just going to kind
of blur out the edges of my finger I
just think that such a pretty color face
wipe to the rescue pretty sure that's
the makeup looks dumb I really like it I
just think it's very glowy like I don't
if you can see on camera but the glow on
my cheekbones I'm really loving that as
I said at the beginning when you have
dry to a dull skin I feel like this
there's nothing you can do to get that
glowy look and everyone's talking about
getting the glow sometimes I just feel
like my skin looks so flat so yes of
quite a few put up quite a few layers
but I think if we just take the time and
enjoy the process of it I love the
finished look and it doesn't feel heavy
at all because every layer is very light
so it just was fresh and glowy and I
don't feel like I look so I see either I
don't know if the lights are making it
look like I'm looks fussy but it just
doesn't sit like that in the mirror and
it feels great so I hope you guys
