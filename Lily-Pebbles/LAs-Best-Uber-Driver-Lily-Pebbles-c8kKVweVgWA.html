LA its day to be arrived Monday night
yesterday we had the whole day here and
now it's Wednesday and I think I'm just
gonna vlog today because I want to do
loads of other things yesterday I made a
different video that hopefully you guys
saw on Sunday
I want to snapchat and take photos so I
don't want a daily vlog but today we're
doing quite a few cool things so I
thought I would vlog I've just started
doing my makeup and put my hair up in a
pineapple so that's why I look kind of
half done we've had such a nice time so
far I'm here with Anna of course was
staying at the Mondrian Hotel which is
so nice this is my room it is absolutely
huge and really really nice and we're
heading down to Anaheim on Friday which
is where VidCon is with VidCon if you
don't know it is this huge like YouTube
conference they have every year where
youtubers from all around the world get
together do panels meetups meet each
other
Network meet viewers so we're gonna rent
a car and drive down there which is
petrifying because I've never driven in
America and I've never driven an
automatic car but it should be fun so I
will let you know what I'm up to today
first of all I need to get ready and do
my makeup because I had a bit of a
lie-in this morning so please
brolo makeup it's done and I'm gonna set
up the filming and then sew out my hair
and then figure out what I'm actually
filming because I've done that yeah okay
I'm all set up ready to film I've done
my hair and makeup but I should just let
my hair straight because I kind of got
to curl it my little play suit so I'm
gonna get filming it and still make you
wear shoes I see someone way
finish filming I hope it all comes out
alright and ever really know till I
import all the footage I'm just getting
ready now because we're heading downtown
to I think it's in Koreatown it's a
restaurant called miss Sheree or
something like that it's in the
top-of-the-line hotel which is somewhere
we visited last time we came to LA in
the absolute you loved it so we're gonna
go there for brunch I'm a meeting Jen
for Matt the YouTube channel closed
Encounters
I have watched Jen for years I'm such a
huge fan she seems like such a lovely
genuine person so I'm really excited to
finally meet her because we'd be
messaging for a while so that would be
really nice it might take a while to get
there though because there's so much
traffic in LA so I'm getting ready now
so we can leave early we are now heading
out you didn't know I'm doing a vlog
today cuz they were doing fun stuff so
we're gonna head to the line to meet Jen
and I'm really looking forward some
avocado toast because all I've had this
morning is sweets and cookies good
morning to keep me here information
anything
yes exactly oh good
we're in Korean town actually didn't
take as long as we thought we're a bit
early so we're gonna go to fit the shop
that they have downstairs from the line
it's called like pocket or something I
still get emails and then use less of
other ways we can get so much stuff it's
like marble heaven so we're gonna go
have a look and then go upstairs meet
Jen and eat a lot what I came there
we just finished we just finished brunch
slash lunch and did I sleep my first
boomerang I'm gonna post it tomorrow
really excited now Jen wants to take a
selfie but it's so sunny not complaining
pretty much sighs - your son
photo-taking
- right it's really very hard to find
someone
okay we're walking to a place with still
no la I don't really know much about it
parents I see a shaved flavored ice
flavored snow
here's snow la the shaver II sounds
really I'm trusting you gents
okay I just got to sample some of the
snow and it literally is like snow it
like dissolves in your mouth I'm gonna
go for the original and then it's all
these toppings you can take to go on top
so we'd have never had anything like
this
we've now left Jen and snow la was
really cool it was such a weird texture
to eat this just like flaked flavored
ice is really cool I wish we had that at
home we're now heading back to the
Gurubashi bunny said pick up one more
thing from Sephora for my mum and we've
got one all could like a couple of hours
we're actually going to The Late Late
Show we're gonna be in the audience

so excited so we've got a couple of
hours gonna do a little bit shopping and
then head back to the hotel change and

really impressive it is and Mariah

wish to read this here my friends Anna
came we were going to go back to the
hotel and quickly change which all going
to the Late Late Show we nobody have
time and we're just gonna be in the
audience so it doesn't really matter so
if they really go straight there Anna
Kendrick and Jeff Goldblum ever get
excited I don't know we never actually
watched the full show really see the
clips on YouTube so I don't really know
what's gonna have like happen but we're
just gonna be in the audience I think we
just feel like a mini articles it's a
mini mini one all these mini foods
really do some good we're just throwing
out the Late Late Show we went like in
the back green room and it was really
smooth and they they know what they're
doing it was so professional Anna
Kendrick was hilarious but I think I
love her even more now seeing her like
live
she's just brilliant it like improvising
and just being really funny
I can't wait till the clips on YouTube
maybe you might spot me a nanner in the
background grouping with our arms up it
