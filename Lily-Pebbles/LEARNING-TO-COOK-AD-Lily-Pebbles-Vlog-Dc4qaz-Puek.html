and I'm gonna be vlogging a one day vlog
today because I'm going somewhere pretty
special for a really fun day out and
working with Danone light and free for
this video and I'm working with them on
their most recent campaign which I
really really like it just feels so like
relevant to me and I'm so into the whole
idea I need to leave in like 10 minutes
before I do I thought I'd quickly let
you know what this is all about and
explain a little bit about their
campaign you might have seen it over the
past couple of weeks or maybe even since
the wedding I've been really busy and
that's because I've really been in the
mindset of like saying yes to things and
being really proactive and enthusiastic
and just kind of getting stuck into
everything and I'm really loving it I
feel like when you start saying yes to
more things you just start doing more
fun and interesting things I definitely
feel like I'm more busy than ever I'm
really loving it and I'm loving being
back at work and Danone light and free
they've set up this amazing like country
getaway retreat for the day and myself
along with some other bloggers are gonna
go and experience some amazing things
that can kind of keep your mind and body
fit and healthy during the colder months
we're going to be doing an all terminal
cooking class I don't really know what
else is happening actually it's like a
whole day thing I'm actually driving
separately everyone asks getting the
coach but I get really travel sick so
I'm gonna drive separately me everyone
there and then we're having just like a
day of fun we're not staying over we're
coming back later and I'm so excited I'm
gonna bring my camera along and film the
whole day for you guys
my friend Lydia's gonna be there so it'd
be really nice to catch up with her I'm
gonna jump in my car probably where you
have to film my journey because it's
just me but I will fill you guys in when
I get there and I'll see you then this
is what I'm wearing today it's pretty
casual ASOS denim jeans Steve Madden
boots at my weddings in the boot this
gray jumper is from cause it's the one
with a little shirt in the back this
scarf is from Topshop like last year and
my old whistles coat as well and my
saline bag ooh I'm like blue and blue
okay I'm gonna go I've made a really
epic playlist for the car journey so I'm
excited to listen to that guys I am here
and wow that journey was incredible I
wasn't expecting it to be so beautiful
it's like the perfect time of year it's
like proper autumn and I was driving
through the countryside and the
like bright yellow and red and I was
just like in awe of it I really really
loved that journey like the countryside
he Bettany here so beautiful I wish the
autumn lasted longer okay I'm gonna pull
in now and go and meet the rest of the
group oh dear I don't think I wore
enough layers today it's pretty cold I'm
just walking up to the reception area to
meet everyone
it's yeah we're just waiting for
everyone else to arrive and then we're
gonna go to the cook house which
apparently is like laid out like the
bake-off you get with your station each
and we're gonna do like it will terminal
cooking class we're just heading over to
the cook house now to have a little
introduction and kind of hear about what
we're doing today this is their herb
garden and we're gonna basically look
around and look at all the ingredients
that are gonna be easy today to make the
recipe I see
I am the worst in my life away we here
you know I really hate when you've been
gone somehow
we've come into the cookhouse and we're
basically gonna have an L like
containment lesson because nations here
it's very exciting I'm gonna hopefully
learn how to cook we've got an apron
I think this obviously means we're
making pickled baby beet root which is
very exciting because I absolutely love
beetroot so that's what I'm gonna making
we've got all the yummy yogurts here oh
my god I didn't really have breakfast so
I'm really up for having one of these
right now Lydia's gonna be in the
station next to me I'm gonna have one of
these which the raspberry flavor
raspberry razzle
ready to try beat treat for the first
time and cook it so the chef just told
us what we're going to be doing and I
was trying to remember everything now
it's basically clean be true I'm really
looking for - I think I can do it
and I really love cooking be true so I'm
actually genuinely excited to try making
it okay I need to pull some stuff in
this pan and then cut the beat you up
Obata gory polymer
I'm now gonna add all of these into the
boiling water and cook for like two to
three minutes
oh and try not to smash myself
okay I am ready I wish in the air terms
of ready to take these out now and peel
them so now apparently I have to use a
spoon to peel the beetroot so I've never
filled anything with a spoon before I'm
gonna give it a go
we've added beet juice and vinegar and
sugar in here I need to like bring out
to a simmer and then I think we're
putting the beet roots in I managed to
peel them or I did some of the peeler
and I did some of the spoon I need to
tidy them off a bit here I've added my
beetroot pieces I did lose two on the
floor but they're just simmering away
and pickling like five to seven minutes
I'm really looking for silence now learn
how to make slaw
it's a fennel slaw but I'm gonna leave
out the fennel because I hate fennel
now we're gonna be making a slaw and if
all these amazing fresh vegetables from
basically out there they grow them all
here I'm gonna be leaving out the fennel
and the ginger and the coriander so I'm
a bit funny with those flavors but
everything else I really really love so
that's the ginger in the fennel there's
like lye carrots and cucumber chilies as
well so I'm busy gonna cut all this up
with this really scary kind of machine
thing that slices everything and we've
got a dressing as well to me
I'm going to cuss up this beet treat now
and inside it looks so pretty I'll show
you look how incredible this feature is
amazing try a little bit they're really
really sweet okay there is my slaw
pretty impressive that looks very
colorful these are so yummy I'm gonna
make myself a little plate with my slaw
someone make a good beetroot and then
there's like chicken and stuff up there
for us to share now we get yawn yummy

like an hour free time now so I mean

to go boating I don't know if you skip I
think you do got my lifejacket on it's a
bit big but put it over my coat and I

my life more worried about my camera and
microphone getting wet but we're gonna
go on that boat over there how good are

strongpoint Eva got a boat look at this
lovely horsey his name's Gimli she's

had such a nice day
Lydia's here with her flowers have you
had it where are you yes I've had a
lovely day good and we didn't give
ourselves food poisoning but it was a
wall so great yes just getting back into
my car to drive home and yeah really
nice it was a pretty nice to do like a
cooking course I don't normally get to
do things like that and actually I
thought I was really bad at cooking but
I think I was all right definitely think
I did okay it wasn't that difficult but
I'm proud of myself and I've had a
really fun like spontaneous midweek day
I don't usually get to do things like
this on a Wednesday so that has been so
fun being so nice to just get some like
really nice country fresh air than the
weather today's been beautiful so we've
been very lucky I feel good I can go
home now and get some good work done
tonight so I'm going to hit the road I
just got home and I tied my hair
straight up and got into comfy clothes
of course I'm gonna put these flowers
into a farz they're so so pretty I'm
actually going with two bunches and not
sure how I think I stole them off Lydia
and I feel really bad I was just asking
her if I could have some of her
eucalyptus but she ends up giving me one
of her whole bunches so I have two that
was very kind of her I think that's
probably the worst flower arrangement I
have ever done but I'm very hungry to
make myself some dinner so I hope you
