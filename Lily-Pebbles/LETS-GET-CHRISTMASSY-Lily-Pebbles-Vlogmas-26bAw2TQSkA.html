today Sunday the 4th of December and I'm
very sorry for ending my vlog last night
crying but I really wanted to end it and
I couldn't you know you're like talk but
talking makes you cry and there's just
like that's why I never cry but when I
do it's like epic so yeah I was a little
bit mush
I've woken up this morning I feel a
little bit sore like my back hurts a bit
but I'm fine
we have no car on clearly so plans have
changed a lot today which is probably
was meant to be coming down but he's not
now and then we thought oh what a good
day to do the Christmas tree but we're
kind of Carles so we're gonna have to
like get buses and tubes and ubers and I
so I think we've decided we're gonna get
a fake tree this year from John Lewis
just because we've got a really small
space to poetry and I feel like the fake
ones are a bit skinnier I was always
really against fake ones because I love
the smell of a Christmas tree but now
that we haven't really got a car to go
pick up a real tree anyway and the John
Louis ones comes in like a box I think
we're just gonna get the bus to a
shopping center and then go to John
Lewis and he's get some extra baubles
from like maybe the white company
because we haven't got enough some more
lights and I need to go to boots just
gonna be one of those Sundays I think I
should probably be taking it easy but
this is our only chance to do Christmas
trees so I want to do it today we're
gonna head to a market to catch up with
my sisters and the kids women see them
today but I really want to see the kids
they'll cheer me up and thankfully
Rich's sister is staying with us this
weekend and she's gone into town with
her friends so she's put rich on the
insurance for her car so we're gonna
borrow her car today which would be
really handy so we're gonna go to the
market and then we're gonna go get tree
stuff morning car you're not looking too
shabby this morning Oh nice bit of
greenery going on literally the lorry
was green I'm just in the white company
and we're getting some decorations
because a lot of stuff is discounted
then we're gonna get some more lights
and then in here I've got like few of
these which are really nice some of the
things little silver once I got winter
diffuser to make the flat smile wintry
because the tree is gonna be fake some
of these because you guys know I love
anything gray for more of those and
that's all we're getting for now we're
in John Lewis and we're just heading up
to the christmas floor to go and find a
tree hopefully the first weekend of
December and all the Christmas trees and
John Lewis have sold out yeah we're not
really sure what to do I guess it's off
but we have quite like a specific
criteria but we need for our tree
because we've got the height you just
don't have the win
some of the trees are bit too wide but
John Lewis one was perfect
I'm so annoyed can get it online I think
but I kind of need it today the only day
we have to do it and I need it so I can
fill my videos this week we're just
doing some food shopping while we're
here
Oh get some mince pies guys look what we
found Dairy Milk to decorations are the
best picked up some shopping lucky we
have your sister's car now we're gonna
go find a tree we are determined found
one home basically quite like the said
that was perfect they didn't have any
stuff so we're gonna go for the five
forever
all right we're home and we're gonna
unpack our food shopping and I'm gonna
get into comfy clothes I'm also a bit
moody because the guy in home base is so
rude so I got into a bit of like oh you
know you're shopping and you get angry
so let's get out of my route I'm gonna
put on some really comfy clothes we're
gonna put home alone on and like put
some candles on and do some Christmas
tree and stuff I put the white company
winter incense sticks
no not incense I always forgot this is
cool do you know what I mean and home
alone on TV we're making tea and Rick
was making coffee and his thing that I
don't know what this is and we've got
some canopies Waitrose and mince pies oh
yeah Ann is so good she like makes her
own mince pies but I just buy them yeah
we're sure I like the most likely heat
it up with cream you bought cream mmm
good mince pie okay let's build our tree
let's build our tree oh I feel a bit
embarrassed to have a fake tree I don't
know why but it's it's gonna fit this is
the space of working with so um it's
pretty tight don't get offended cuz I
just said that I was embarrassed to have
a fake tree I mean no offense to people
that do you have them I just love real
trees I love the smell and everything
but this is the decision this
oh god Havilland's that loud well I'm
far for and Christmas although I got up
to all of that hassle in home base in
the guy who was so unhelpful we just got
back in our tree has fake pine cones on
it I hate the one strike room I think
they look like little poos but rich
students think that we can unpick all
the pine cones so we're gonna put it up
and then we're gonna take the pine cones
that you're missing I will keep you warm
as soon as you remove that smell
whatever we do we
alright who's holiday well the tree is
up and it's looking good I mean I think
like the six or seven foot would have
been nicer but this definitely works
Joe it doesn't look that fake we're
gonna mover decorate it and then move
the back a bit so it's a bit less like
in the middle of the roof gosh the sofa
so glittery you've got some canapés
going on here
you have chickenpox
whatever we do we will be alright these
holiday wonders will open your mind
well a few more decorations that I can't
put up until I've done a whole video
hashtag each you've got problems and we
need to find a topper just looks
incomplete I can't find one that isn't
like tacky and blingy so let me know if
you guys know where I can find a nice
one from okay definitely need a bit of
color the purple chocolates are adding a
tiny bit of color the outside and do
call the snowman's no home alone is
finished just in time I'm gonna start
