last day of vlogmas how sad is this I'm
just kind of pampering myself I tend to
do this on Christmas Eve get my life in
order wash my hair do you my nails just
make myself feel nice ready for
Christmas so excuse me while I just let
my hair dry and then straighten it but
I'll be back I'm so excited for
Christmas really excited for Christmas
yeah okay I'm ready and I'm feeling good
I'm so excited today
I've got in like a festive shirt I've
got on a red lip my hair it's clean and
washed and I feel good we've got a lot
to do today we've got to set the table
for tomorrow
my dad's properly sick in bed which is
really annoying so rich is helping my
mom out a lot at the moment walking the
dog and doing all the drinks and stuff
that my dad normally does and I think
I'm in charge of setting the table which
is a big task I've got to go get the
crackers ready
we like to put little gifts on people's
where they sit as well I don't think
we're doing like place names I don't
think I think you can say wherever you
want but we're gonna put a little gifts
down oh but then how we know whose gift
is for whomever you will do place names
I'm gonna go downstairs and chats my mum
about it yeah I've had my last I drink
calendar chakra I always think it's a
stupid that there isn't one for
Christmas Day like that's a bit of an
anti-climax really but I've had my last
one I can throw this all right now mom's
prepping the turkey was that cheese oh
butter bacon and butter he's all I'm in
charge of the room I've just found my
sister in a panic like come over and
help me I'm not really that good at this
kind of thing well I think I am but then
I'll be told I don't wrong so we're
gonna have the table in here it puts us
to push the sofa back there these are
the two big tables that need to go out
this needs to go somewhere else
rich is just taking Dixie for a walk so
when he gets back I think we're gonna
saw other tables I'm just gathering
although I've got some crackers these
are some Clarins crackers but one Joe
Malone cracker one this works cracker
and some Harvey Nichols ones two people
are in for a treat this year at my house
it has just got back from walking Dixie
and for some reason felt the need to
tell me Dixie did the biggest poos ever
four big poos why did you family
tell me about herpes because over big
he's happy for her
you're so weird is it certainly we're
gonna put on the other set of twinkle
lights that we got because the tree
looks all right it's weird because these
the lights are actually working and I'll
go to touch them in case they let you
keep me again but part of them aren't
working like here and we don't really
know what's happened so we're just gonna
kind of leave it because I think it's
twinkly enough when it's dark you put
the big table here so we can put the
turkey and food on just because there
won't be that much space on the table it
was easier to kind of serve up and some
really pretty flowers here as well
nice and trays and just take that into
the other room but I can't lift it
because of my back face they won't do it
by ourselves let's just move it over
there so we can put the tables are no no
rich rich rich rich rich come on now
don't ruin Christmas oh because you've
got a bad back okay one table up it's
one more to go some reason we use this
table every year and every year we have
to gather tape it together to make sure
it doesn't fall down does anyone else
have weird things like this like a new
table like this one over here from
Costco it's really not that expensive
but we choose to use this weird wooden
one that we have to get a tape every
here we go hummus is a lady Carly and
burner here now and they're saving the
day and we rearranged in the room oh
look some backed into a corner this
table is coming out and coming all the
way around here and the tables are
getting pushed that way got 19 18 people
fit on this table so it's quite a
struggle okay my job now is to make
place names and
I'm gonna do it on pages on my laptop
okay this is what the place names are
gonna look like I just need to print
them off and cut them out okay I printed
all the names and I've got card I'm not
really sure Mundi yet I've got one she
take a bit stick and let's see if it
makes any looks okay
that doesn't look too bad though it
doesn't look like it says Ryan this
exists Ian Paice is being my little
helper good sticking we're all working
hard rich does made himself like the
ultimate sandwich and didn't offer
anyone else what's in that huh
whole-grain mustard mayonnaise and
choosers
place we've laid out the tablecloth and
I've put some of this greenery in the
middle so we're looking a bit bare but I
think once you put all the crackers out
it would look better and I like the
little place names that they look sweet
okay I think we're done with the table
we have a few different crackers these
are the Clarins ones are very pretty we
also have some from Harvey Nichols those
are very pretty visa Waitrose for the
men and my dad gets this works a deep
sleep cracker because he's not well at
the moment I think it's looking very
pretty and once there's lots of food on
it it will look very festive and fun it
also puts their little baubles over here
with the twinkle lights then he looks
nice I'm just waiting for rich to get
back so I'm going to take my nail polish
off because it's been chipped for ages I
want to do my nails up nice and get
sorry tonight for Christmas Day but I'm
going to tip my nail polish off now and
then paint them with this kind of retain
stuff make my nails stronger file them
put the oil on and then just let them
heal a bit throughout the day before I
put on loads of glitter tonight and ruin
them again okay I'm proper hiring me now
so we're gonna go and get some food I'm
also gonna put some little presents out
for people on their table so when I get
home I'm gonna do my nails and I'm gonna
wrap the little presents in tissue at
them on I think just for the ladies
we've got a little beauty products I can
give them I don't think the men maybe
I'll wrap some chocolates up for the men
so it's a few now so we just went to our
friend John's house say Merry Christmas
to see him before Christmas Day and now
we're gonna go to Planet organic because
I want to get some coconut water and I
want to get staying healthy for lunch
and just have a little bit of a mooch

that it's dark and it's nighttime and
it's Christmas Eve and I've had mulled
wine I'm gonna get into my Christmas
onesie and watch Christmas films tonight
and I'm very happy about that
I just FaceTime honey and Bailey and I
can't handle the cuteness
the baby's like missing a little note to
Santa say thank you and they've left out
a carrot and mince pie and milk and I
just want to be five and two again
because it's just not fair I'm gonna use
this wrapping paper now to wrap the
little gift so I've got like a few
little things a little mini Jamie loan
candle and it's a little nail polish I'm
gonna wrap those all up now put them on
people's little places I'm not giving
myself a gift because I really don't
need one
yeah snuck upstairs because I need to
put Mitch stocking together so I put on
my Santa's hat because I'm on Sansa duty
I'm having to give him a stocking that
has my name on it because they don't
have any others so I'm just gonna have
to turn it that way and I've hidden his
presence under the bed yeah I think he's
also downstairs doing my stocking we're
not very good at this I'm gonna fill it
now here's the first year we've properly
done it for each other
you know we don't normally spend
Christmas together so that's the best
ones I'm gonna put that at the bottom
how do you remember I got him but
hopefully this is nice stuff in there
okay so that's done we have to fight
this somewhere maybe back under the bed
this thing go under the bed until
tomorrow I have my Christmas onesie on
feeling very comfy very festive and I'm
gonna go downstairs to watch some
Christmas films I think I've done all my
duties now actually maybe while I'm here
I'll do my vlogmas thank you and she
don't have his lights not like the
Oscars or anything but I thought I've
just chats you guys about how I think
vlogmas has been because it is the first
time I've ever done it and daily
vlogging is something I've never done
any time of the year I just normally do
weekly vlogs and I don't even do those
every week so I knew it would be an
intense task and I've loved it and hated
it both I think I've definitely loved it
more I feel like I've got to know you
guys better and you've definitely got to
know me better it's been a massive
challenge like work-wise having to vlog
every day and edit every day I mean I
haven't gone to bed before 1 a.m. one
single night this month but it's been
fun and I actually think it's been
really weird not vlogging tomorrow don't
really know like what I'm gonna do with
myself because when you start vlogging
every day you really kind of think
before like you get camera when when you
anticipate something happening and I
don't know it just becomes like part of
your daily routine
something I've really noticed though
during vlogmas and i've massively
appreciated as being all of your
comments because my main videos are
beauty related that i don't really show
much personality in them I don't think
it's very kind of product based than you
know a high end or low end or very
product II and the vlogs are so far from
that that your comments have all been so
nice and just completely different to
this or comments I get on my PC videos
not they're not normally nice but it's
very different it's way more personal
and I've really enjoyed reading them
every single night I literally read
every single comment on every vlog so
thank you if you've left any kind of
comment this month ruin vlogmas I really
do appreciate it
I don't know if I'd do it again I think
it depends what I'll be doing this time
next year but obviously I'll keep doing
my weekly vlogs because I do enjoy
vlogging what I'm up to every now and
again but anywhere I won't go on I'm
really glad
you guys have enjoyed my blogs and I
really do appreciate all your comments
and I'm looking forward to putting the
camera down tonight editing the vlog and
that being that for vlogmas I think I am
gonna do a blog post on Boxing Day sales
this year so you're watching this
Christmas Day tomorrow
unboxing down my blog I should have a
post about all the kind of best pics
from the sales but if I can stay up to
midnight on Christmas Day and bother to
write the post put that's what I'm
planning to do okay I'm gonna head back
downstairs now make myself a hot drink I
was about to grab my charger and take it
downstairs but I don't have to do that
because they don't need to vlog tomorrow
