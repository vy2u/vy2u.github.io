weekly vlog today in it's Monday you
would have seen from last week's choose
their video that I'm going to the
Burberry show today I'm really excited
I've never been to the Burberry show
actually I'm not really doing Fashion
Week's this year this season apart from
this one show actually and I'm really
excited I'm gonna go backstage first
with Ruth and then we're gonna watch the
show together so I'm going to take you
guys along with me because I'm not doing
that much stuff this week and today is
quite a busy day so let's start this
weekly vlog
okay I just got tensed and cardoons I'm
going to the backstage entrance and
where I is muttering sorry annoying just
waiting to go backstage drizzly you guys
know my hair it's hair gone because the
rain
we know the gap between backstage and
the shows you in them
it's all over so quickly it takes like
15 minutes and it's done with that
friend but a little look at which celebs
are getting more literally paparazzi
everywhere
that was amazing the opening song was
will you still love me when she was a
cover but it was originally written by
Carole King and I'm actually going to
the Carole King musical tonight which is
called beautiful so that made me really
excited office like a Carole King day
yeah better than my parents my auntie I
love counting so that was really good
and they ended on the Beatles ended with
like gold confetti and very comfy seats
we were happy so now I'm gonna go find
some a copy to sit for my head off since
this morning I'm now my grandma's and my
cousin's here and she has a pretty
impressive makeup collection actually
how are you she's 15
I think because of Fester's that's not
much it is much okay so wait this is a
dressy table first of all brushes one I
mean there's just concealers is crazy
this is like my collection I love it
were definitely related there is there
another draw the Boston Oh naked - good
choice
alright was on this side oh my god this
is amazing
okie says all of these nice it's just
skin care it's just this hard just say
good I was hanging your mom you should
put little beads in here and then your
brushes will stand up cotton bugs this
is very impressive
I'm impressed just heading to the dancer
now absolutely I'm quite tired as I said
earlier I'm gonna see beautiful which is
the Carole King musical I'm a big big
fan of Carole King and James
mentioned before and if you don't know
Carole King is she's a pretty famous
songwriter that you may not think you
know her you probably know most of the
songs that she's written so I'll let you
know what music was like over heard
really good things so Hornets and
minstrels I need some sugar I just
finished at the theater that's how you
want to quit when I get home so I'm back
from the theater I thought quickly let
you know I thought with it before I
switch off and go to bed because it's
been a really long day so my dad my mom
and my aunt - even all big Carole King
fans so it was really nice listening to
all the amazing songs which will always
be incredible it was really nice hearing
the whole story of her life we thought
it was a little bit cheesy it's very new
though and you can kind of feel that it
was a new cast no quite nervous I think
tomorrow night Carole King's actually
going to watch it so I'm really jealous
of that it was good I think it could
have been better
I think you'd only like it if you know
Carole King and her songs but you will
know more her songs than you think you
do I'm happy I saw it it wasn't the best
show I've ever seen but now I just can't
stop singing her songs and they're all
in my head so I'm gonna go to sleep now
and I will vlog again on Wednesday I
think which I'm actually going to the
theater again we're going with Anna and
Margaret so I'll see you guys on
Wednesday night morning everyone it's
Wednesday today and I've just filmed my
February favorites video which is going
up Sunday so that you should have seen
it by now
I was really quick filming actually I
think they're the easiest videos film
because I'm just sitting and talking
about my favourites it's very simple
phones so now I need to just kind of
take down my lights
I got another light there and I've got
one here so I'm much happier with my
lighting setup now Tanya burr very
kindly gave me one her lights actually
seen Tanya today we are going for lunch
which will be really nice and it's
Wednesday so yesterday I stayed at home
worked all day tonight means theatre
again we're going to see the Curious
Incident of the dog at night which is an
adaptation of a book that I haven't read
I read a bit of it but this was years
ago and I couldn't really get into the
book and I forgot to try again but
apparently the play is really really
good and so I'm excited to see that yeah
I'm just gonna get ready for the day
these are all my monthly favourites here
if you haven't seen the video I'll link
it below this vlog this little
collection I put them all in this box
just quite handy and I can carry it down
from my bedroom okay I've just done a
bit of work so I'm gonna get ready and
then I'm gonna go and meet Tanya for
lunch I'm hungry and we Tanya now and
hey we're going to green break she's
obsessed for everything
she doesn't buy these things I'm not
from here and I just think so we're
going on goddamn offensive negatory Rio
it's green brain when I left my house
this morning my mom also left the house
paints greenery for lunch like are you
joking
so we're gonna be in the same place very
nice Pucci flowers we're gonna have some
lunch and ketchup will be this we just
finished lunch it was delicious poppin
the guy gave me honey instead of maple
syrup but I poured it all over my food
and I was like now I've got food covered
honey you really didn't seem to care how
was the old man it was so good yes it
was such a nice salad actually and then
on the way out we just saw the cutest
baby and I said see if I could have that
baby I'd have a baby right now and she
was that baby specific maybe I said yeah
that one it was like wearing a pink baby
bro no no we're in this place with sweet
things and they have smores fudge bar

worried now I've looked it you have
together
okay so just write this by the way I'm
full of course and I see Elysium flower
you're getting there yeah I'm heading to
the Glee markets for a meeting
lemon drizzle with tasters images I can
try but if they're small things I just
ask them yeah yeah
it looks good though I'm feeling it
funny looks logging by myself this wine
it's much later on now and I'm about to
meet rich and Anna and Mark for dinner
we're going to this place with ribbon
bow which is like at least Korean
restaurant
and I'm just waiting for it she's got
dogs a service station and we're gonna
have dinner and go to the theater to get
now
bitches here how was work oh good it's
bad
are you looking forward to Korean yeah I
hate that Korean barbecue before I think
this is like they're so cool that they
have all the rice and the ball is a
special name for the dish just cool like
bit from the back flip them back but
here's what's good credit before it's
really good I'm hoping Anna remark I
like it I'm not convinced that they will
but fingers bust
Anna's here now I was just discussing
with the camera whether you're gonna
like this one I'm not sure at the Korean
place I had bit from the back and both
sides and I'd really like to actually
went sleep and go and I said I'll link
it below what did you guys think of your
Guinness yeah successful meal we're not
gonna go to this notice rain April so as
you know I've already been sent there to
watch this week and I had a whole public
administrators kind of Orion issues
against Weber Theatre makes me eat
minstrels we need
yes
feel fresh fine I know the story I think
is gonna be good part of the set designs
that you amazing it up means good news
I beg to tell you you love to get mad
let's do so you love the program you
just come out just rich baby got a
little gonna go my back I'm properly
deep freak when I get home but I don't
of the year enjoy it
I nearly forgot to finish my vlog again
I always do that when I come home so
that was incredible
definitely up there with probably the
best three things I've ever seen on
stage the best non-musical I've ever
seen the whole set is really really
amazing I don't wanna give anything away
but it's not the second normal play it's
very modern and techy and really
interesting and completely gripping
there was a one single boring part
there's parts that made me scared and
cry and happy inside and it was a bit of
an emotional rollercoaster but it was so
so good I'd actually see it again which
is quite rare I think for like a play to
want to see it again it was really
really good very small cast and the main
boy he played the main character was
absolutely amazing it's yeah I would
definitely recommend it I'm gonna go
sleep there I'll probably vlog again on
the weekend so I'll see them hi guys it
is Sunday and this vlog is already very
long I've already edited it and it
should be about 10 minutes at this point
but I wanted a vlog today because it's a
really exciting day for me I haven't
really left this spot well yeah so
yesterday I popped out to see my friends
new flats and that was the first time
I'd left the house in three days and
that is because my new blog launches
tonight which you would know because I
mentioned it in my third period
favourites video showing up Sunday
morning so me and my really good friend
Jay who we actually lived together at
uni and he helped me set up my blog when
it was very very very first started so
it's really nice that he's working on it
with me now and it's like a
collaboration thing so I'm quite
involved with like the creative side of
it because I really like have a really
strong opinion of these things but he's
the genius who made it happen and
created all the snazzy stuff it really
is kind of his brain that's gonna be
launching tonight and I'm so excited I'm
just really happy it's finally happening
we've been working on it for like five
months I think and I shut down my blog
on Friday night I just had LP makeover
and like a little thing you can sign up
to get notified so tonight is the night
and last night my nephew niece stayed
over middle of sleepover and it was very
cute but they woke us up at 7:00 a.m.
Bailey came in our room with a
tambourine seriously so I'm gonna have a
three hour break which is exciting
because Jay has to help his friend move
he's
Germany by the way so we've done all of
this over email and Skype it's crazy
actually let me show you your website
okay so ignore the ad there's like some
crazy orange ad at the moment that this
is any web site this is the new logo and
I've got lots of new categories London
exploring food and drink shopping beauty
style lifestyle videos with all my
different types of videos here so you
can look at latest posts or popular
posts and then I'm always going to have
my most recent video up here and then
the websites like a little grid so
there's a mix of blog posts Instagram
photos you can shop my favorite products
you can request a blog post it shows my
recent tweet it says my Facebook page
and then I've got a few different series
like my blogging guide the London
diaries weekly vlogs where life eats and
then at the bottom there's something
else special as well for those that
bother to scroll all the way down but
you go and explore it for yourself I
won't show you too much have a little
browse hopefully all my content is there
much easier to kind of find and browse
there's so much stuff and written over
the last kind of five years that I just
didn't want old stuff to get lost so I
think this is a really nice way to bring
up some old favorite posts I had
internet just have fun with it enjoy it
yeah the little kiddies what you eating
black Grady's mmm yummy did you have a
sleepover last night did you have fun
yeah did baby take over the whole bed
and squish you on the side you silly
Bailey okay I just popped out to for a
quick walk to get some fresh air which
was much needed and actually had lunch
in the same pub as Mel C I wasn't kind
of that bothered about it I guess
because you look so normal but the nine
year old me would have absolutely
freaked out a Spice Girl being in the
same pub as me I also got some lemon
juice or cakes I'm gonna eat that now I
think Jay is just getting back so we're
gonna carry on I don't think there's
that much left to do but I want to make
sure that it works on every browser and
that it won't kind of crash when it
relaunches at 7:00 yeah I think
everything's in place for the launch
tonight I'm actually gonna head over to
my friend Gemma and Ben's flat because
rich is there and I don't wanna be
sitting sitting here on my own and all
the excitement is happening I'm gonna
get Jay off with a Skype and I think
we're gonna have a little champagne she
is your moment hopefully looking forward
to this
so my braces are really dry sorry so I'm
gonna head over there now
Praeger completely forgot to mention
that the website hasn't taken five
months because of Jay being slow or
anything I am such a control freak and
also we were just taking our time
because I'm also really sure it started
with the logo redesign I didn't really
know I wanted to redo my blog and it's
just been he knows no rush I hadn't
announced that I was doing it so we've
just taken our time and enjoyed it
that's why it didn't so long okay I'm at
jammer and Ben's and I have my computer
all set up ready to go
Jay's on skype I have Twitter open I
