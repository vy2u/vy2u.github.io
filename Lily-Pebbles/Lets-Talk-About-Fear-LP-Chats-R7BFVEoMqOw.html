right now I think I'm probably on a
flight from London to New York so I
thought it was fitting for me to finally
do this video that I've kind of been
talking about on my social media for a
while I wanted to do a video talking
about my fear of flying but I really put
it off for a while and I think I talked
about this on snapchat because I feel
like with my videos I always want there
to be a purpose for them something that
you guys can take away from it and I
wasn't sure the purpose of this video
was I couldn't find like a solution or
any kind of helpful tips because
obviously if I had those that I probably
wouldn't have a fear of flying so I kept
putting off doing the video but someone
sent me a message saying that they felt
that me just talking about it was
helpful so I just thought I would do it
during a while there's so many videos
going up anyway I'm just in my comfy
clothes and I've got my hair and plats
and if you have all my hair and plaques
since I was about 10 but I just fancied
it the cold little day off when you've
got short hair you can't really two
plats properly so let's talk about my
fear of flying and everything the word
fear of flying doesn't even it's not
even relevant to my fear of flying I
think that's something really important
to take away from this video that every
single person has different types of
fears different worries different
feelings and it's all okay
this whole video is just for me to talk
about my personal experience and
feelings towards flying in an aeroplane
and I'm not saying it's the right or
wrong way or anything like that I've
tried to not put too much like orders to
this video and just sit and chat instead
because I feel like when there's too
much order it loses all its kind of
realness so sorry for the rambling but
I'm just gonna talk and I'm also in a
good mood I felt like this video could
have been very different if I'd filmed
it when I'm just about to go on a flight
whereas I'm going on a flight next week
so I still feel okay right now so I
personally feel like my fear of flying
developed in my early teenage days I was
very lucky as a child okay I got to go
on holiday a lot with my family so I was
always on airplanes from a really young
age and as far as I'm aware anything I
had that much of a problem with it when
I was really little when I started to
get to 12 13 even kind of 15 16 when I
started going on holiday without my
parents and with friends my fear
developed from a
travel sickness thing a lot of people in
my family have travel sickness it's when
you start feeling sick when you're in
cars or boats or planes some people are
actually sick some people just feel sick
I actually think just feeling sick is
worse and that's ten that's not really
what I've got and I just around by I had
this like three or four year period in
my teenage days but every time I'd get
on a flight I would throw up and I hate
throwing up I mean everyone hates
throwing up is there anyone that doesn't
really I wouldn't say I've got a huge
fear of it but when I'm throwing up I'm
hyperventilating and freaking out I'm
just not good at being sick so that
would happen on a flight normally
takeoff landing it would make the whole
thing really stressful I remember a
flight back from Thailand with my family
I was so worried about being sick that I
went to buy some travel sickness pills
they turned out to be like not great
ones and they actually made me sick
so the whole thing was a bit of a
disaster and I really remember going
through a period in my teenage days
where I was always sick on planes and if
I wasn't sick I had terrible ear pain
and I thought the whole experience awful
I used to really panic about not being
able to get to the toilet if I wanted to
be sick or if I was in the toilet and
the seatbelt sign would come on what
would I do so I always sat down the
aisle I had a real kind of paranoia
thing about sitting in the aisle seat so
that I could go out whenever I wanted
the thought of being in a window seat
and feeling sick and not being able to
get out because there are two people
sitting next to me used to properly
freak me out and I remember once like
having an absolute meltdown at check-in
because I couldn't get an RC and it got
really like my mum had to tell me to
calm down because the guys were getting
like you can't really go crazy in an
airport it's not the place to go bad so
I've always been a bit weird about where
I've sat and I think that's where it all
kind of comes from the thing about my
fear of flying is that it's not an
irrational fear not that I'm saying it's
rational but I know that some people are
so scared of flying that they kind of
openly freak out and they're shaky and
they're asking questions and they're
panicking and I've seen people on
flights they look so distressed and it's
really obvious that they're very scared
and I'm not like that at all which is
why a lot of you guys comment on my vlog
saying I don't understand doesn't seem
like you're scared of flying
I am scared inside and you'll never know
really there might be
few signs but for me if I were to openly
freak out on a plane and make other
people worried about me being scared
that just makes the whole situation so
much worse and the last thing I want is
any sort of panic or tense environment
around me I tend to just kind of keep it
all inside and if you heard the things
that went on in my head you would think
I was absolutely crazy but on the
outside I think I probably look quite
calm and collected so now that I've
grown out of the being sick on a plane
thing I definitely still get terrible
travel sickness I'm so bad in cabs and
boats and I've had it before where the
planes kind of circled an airport and
I've been really sick but most of the
time I think I'm okay and I'm not
normally actually sick on a plane so
I've realized now that for me sitting in
the window-seat is actually better
because then I can just zone out into my
own little world and so much of my fear
comes from the atmosphere of being in a
plane I hate the fact that you can't
just get out whenever you want to I hate
the fact that you're uncontacted all you
can't speak to your family or friends
no-one can contact you you're just so
detached from the world I feel like it's
a really lonely place I know some people
love that about flying I absolutely hate
it so I found that when I was in the ILC
I was so involved in what was going on
in the plane and every time an SS walked
past or a baby ran somewhere or
something went on I just felt like I was
too involved with everything that was
going on so I remember trying the
window-seat for the first time and I was
freaked out just about changing and you
know I'm not great with things like that
so I tried the window-seat and it was a
life changer and I just love that I can
zone out it's my own little world I've
got my little noise cancelling
headphones and I can be in my own little
world so now I'm obsessed with
window-seat I have to have a window seat
middle Z's the worst aisle seat freaks
me out a bit so definitely a window seat
person I start to feel nervous about two
days before a flight and it comes out in
an organizational way so ions or person
who makes lists about what to pack
I have lists of lists of lists I start
packing weeks before my holiday and I
think that's all part of the nerves
really because it's just me prepping
myself for getting on that flight I
don't want to get on the flight and not
have what I need with me so all the kind
of organization leading up to it I think
is all part of the fear
and then when I get to the airport I'm
okay I feel like now I'm older I've got
into a real routine the more you fly
I've definitely found the more that I've
flown the more I've got used to it and I
kind of know my routine that definitely
helps a lot I have to get a bottle of
water in the airport once I've checked
through security if I don't get a bottle
of water
I'm very very sure anything I've ever
not had a box of water because I know
when I feel sick I need water and I have
to have it for takeoff I also always buy
magazines because you can't always
listen to your music on takeoff I think
now you can but you couldn't before and
so I needed a distraction during takeoff
so I get my water and I get my magazines
and always laughs at me because I have
to get my water in magazines and I just
like to be organized because you don't
want anything
adding to the panic of getting on a
flight so I kind of I don't wanna get
there too early because I hate spending
too much time in the airport and
building myself up get there the right
time you know make sure everything's
sorted check-in and nobody okay in the
airport there's things to distract me I
don't mind it I'm on the ground I can
contact people it's all good and then
you start boarding the plane and I just
often feel like I get a bit heavy in my
breathing whenever I get onto the plane
everything's very rushed on I get my
bags in the right place sit down like it
always feels like everything's go super
fast at that point and I like to get
myself and orders put my socks on flight
socks on be organized I hate the smell
of planes I hate playing toilets I very
rarely use them unless I really really
have to I don't really like having
anyone around me and I try not to look
too much to the other people on the
planes I don't know why that always
freaks me out and I don't know if
there's a particular part of a flight
that I find worse I don't love takeoff
and landing I imagine these scenarios in
my head I get a bit obsessed with weird
little things like other too many
suitcases in the plane that's gonna be
too heavy on take off when we land are
we going too fast as the nose gonna hit
the floor like I get really weird and
like technical about things that could
go wrong and I'm really not like that
as a person so I don't know why I try so
hard to kind of fight those thoughts but
though they're so takeoff happens and I
hate it I listen out for the beeps and
the plane I feel like after two beeps
when the SS is stand up I feel way more
calm and I know everything's okay but it
really is the entire flight that I don't
like because it's the uncomfortableness
of
being in a seat like that I find it so I
just
complains I hate the smell I hate the
noise as I said all those things I just
feel so detached and lonely and
uncomfortable and scared but saying that
I think about this a lot when I'm on
flights and I don't think I'm actually
scared of dying myself I have way more
fear of my friends and family dying than
me and I really hope this video doesn't
end up freaking you guys out more but I
think for me the fear is if something
terrible were to happen it's that like
kind of 5-10 minutes when the planes
dropping out of the sky or something
like that I'm scared of not the actual
dying wow this videos got deep I tend to
take travel sickness pills before just
in case but I don't really know if they
do anything I think for me is more of
just like a the action of doing it makes
me feel more calm I've thought about
doing one of those fear of flying
courses before I know that virgin BAE
jet pretty much all the airlines do them
but part of the causes that you have to
go on a flight with other people who are
scared of flying and I'd say that was
probably one of my biggest fears ever is
been on a plane when someone else is
freaking out when there's someone else
you're scared of flying I really can't
look at them or be near them because
that external panic I don't I mean I
don't understand how for me that would
just make me so much worse if I was
freaking out openly that would make for
me the situation is so much more
panicked I do everything I can to keep
myself calm and that if that means
freaking out inside and just closing my
eyes I often just put up my hood so I do
it from if there's turbulence and I'm
really freaking out I put on my hood I
put on my headphones and I just do this
and I think what's the worst that can
happen I'm gonna die it's fine I've
often thought that on a flight like it's
fine I'm gonna die it's really sad my
family friends but it will be good and I
will make a video for me on my youtube
channel it's not the fear of crashing
it's just the horribleness of being on a
plane I just don't like you and I don't
enjoy it and I want it to be over it's
really hard to explain that because I
feel like most people who are scared of
flying
scared of their plane crashing and
mine's just not like that I would never
ever let my fear get in the way of
traveling around the world because from
a young age I've loved going to other
countries and discovering new places or
in traveling on my gap year and now I
try and take every opportunity I can
visit new countries I think I've been to
25 countries I was going to 30 before
third deep I don't know if I'll make it
in time I'm already 28 but that is the
most important thing and I've been on
some tiny scary planes in Ghana I went
on a little plane with propeller
literally my worst nightmare but it's a
hundred percent worth it it's so worth
it even if something awful - what to
happen it would be worth it because I
went to Ghana with comic relief and it
was the best thing ever so I would never
ever let my fears stop me from going
anywhere but just finding those little
things that make the experience better
is worth it so as I said this video had
absolutely no point but it was nice to
just sit and chat and I hope I kind of
expressed what I was trying to say in
this video I don't know if any of you
guys would have a similar thing to me
it's kind of like an environmental fear
situational fear does that make sense
I hate it and I'm dreading going on a
flight I'll be on that flight that I'm
talking about right now and you're
watching this so let's hope it all goes
okay I'm taking with me my nice smelly
things I smell when I'm feeling a bit
panicked and let's just hope the time
goes fast so thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you in my video
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
