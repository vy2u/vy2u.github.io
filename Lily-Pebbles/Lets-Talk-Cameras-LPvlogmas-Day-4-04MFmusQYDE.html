yeah Casey nice that's blog on my phone
and I'm going to turn first thing in the
morning so that I can leave it on for a
couple of hours while I edit yesterday's

hair and then I should be done by about
at lunchtime so as I said it's a cheap
price first and it says an hour for like
two hours medium three hours for dark or

two and three it's a mousse I'm just
gonna pump it onto this and apply it
straight onto my body maybe Richard can

and I forgot to tell you guys that when
I came out for my pedicure it's 15 in a
cafe part of cowshed was Michael
McIntyre I love him I should have got
photo this is what happens when I have
nothing in a day I end up making a 20
minute long vlog and now it means I'm
gonna have to go through and we edit the
whole things try and get it down really
frustrating thanks for taking the
rubbish out it is your job now you want
to throw that you get out get out my
legs are definitely start until it more

off when I shower off the product oh my
god it's so sunny and so I have showered
off I can't find any way where isn't
sunny a showered off my tan of God I
look horrendous but my body feels nicely
tanned it does kind of get dark me
throughout the day and I also just
moisturize my elbows and knees and stuff
with this origins comfort mood ultra
rich vanilla vanilla body butter which
is really nice which is not making a bit
of lunch we've got loads of foods about
to go off so we're just cooking it so it
doesn't go off over the weekend my vlog
is uploading over here and while my hair
dries I think I'm gonna paint my nails
and ready for the weekend okay I think
is my toes are dark I'm gonna go with
this nails ink Alice and Olivia polish
which is in midnight Merlot and then
maybe on one of the fingers I might use
this snow globe and from those ink it's
like a gold glitter you shake up Jesus
shake it up and you can put like as much
or as little as you want on very pretty
my first festive nails of the season
I'm thoroughly enjoying this Lisa
Eldridge makeup tutorial with Alexa
Chung I bloody love Alexa Chung I've put
on the gold topcoat and it was actually
a little more sheer than I thought it
was quite hard to get the glitter up so
I decided to put on all the nails
because it's quite subtle and I love
this look I love a bit of gold glitter
this is what I'm having for lunch fish
and vegetables yes you don't have a
photo at the Polaroid my sister and
brother-in-law and nephew popped by
quickly as equally just saw and I've
straightened my hair I need to put on
some makeup although I'm not gonna put
much on because I'm just going to the
cinema and to my parents house for
dinner tonight
I'm just doing some emails and work now
so far has not been a very productive
day and it's already 3 o'clock okay I'm
going to put on some makeup and I
thought I would just film it because I
haven't really filmed much today and I
think that I'm not gonna put much makeup
on because I'm just going to the cinema
and to my parents and I've makeup so I
want to leave the house but I'm kind of
just doing it because I enjoy doing
makeup I'm gonna talk this is need for
me the Becca backlight priming filter
it's so nice it's a really nice glowy
primer maybe that's a little bit too
much I forgot all over the skin smells
really fresh and like slightly lemony
I'm gonna put on a little bit of shot
silvery light Wonder Foundation just go
shake it up just gonna apply a little
bit of my hands just where I need it I
don't want like a heavy foundation I'm
really running out this foundation I've
used it quite a lot this year
okay then I'm just gonna go over the
parts of my face with a concealer just
urban decay nation feeler I'm going to
put that under my eyes
my nose around my nose and I'll mention
I'm gonna put on a little bit of bronzer
I'm gonna fill in my brows a little bit
little bit of blusher I'm going to use
an H&amp;amp;M cream eyeshadow it's really
lightly so that all over the eye it just
creates a little bit of shadow not much
proper eyes shadow so you can kind of
hardly see that school and then I'm just
gonna put on mascara and leave it there
okay makeup done before I go to my
parents I thought I would quickly do a
little kind of mini camera review
because as you guys may have noticed I
got a new vlogging camera it's the canon
g7x that's what I'm vlogging on now and
a lot of people have asked me what I
think of it and to tell you my thoughts
I have no idea really about the spec of
this camera I Popham what it says here
on the lens and I can't really be
bothered to like research into the
difference in terms of like the spec of
the camera so I'm just going to tell you
from my point of view just when using it
how I think it's different to the s120
this is the s120 which is what i was
using before a lot of youtubers updated
to the g7x way before I did and I didn't
want to because it's a lot bigger in
terms of how big the camera is I really
like that so on 20 because it's so small
and if you're just getting into vlogging
I would definitely recommend this one
it's so much easier to carry around
sniff into your pockets your handbag I
think this is such a good camera the
reason I moved into the g7x is because
the quality is a little bit better and
also there is a flip screen so I can see
myself in the screen above which is a
bit annoying as a viewer because I know
that sometimes like now I look up at
myself and I find that as a viewer
really annoying but it's really good to
check I'm in focus to see what's in shot
so it costs off my head or anything like
that the screen is really handy and I
think that's what makes a camera bulkier
as well I also find you can make it
brighter the darker using the tiny thing
I mean there's so many things you can do
that I haven't really even experimented
yet something I have noticed with the
g7x is the focus although you can focus
very quickly by just pressing down on
the shutter halfway it doesn't
automatically focus as quick so if I
were to now grab the camera and turn it
around and film
got brushes here it then wouldn't be in
focus it would take there quite a few
seconds of the focus and a few people
have pointed that out and that is a bit
annoying I feel like the s120 focus a
lot quicker but I do think the quality
of this one is better
and when I'm doing like close-up shots
or I want to play around the focus a bit
then I feel like I can be a bit more
experimental I mean I'm not that fussy
when it comes to vlogging cameras cuz I
do think the content is more important
than the quality of camera I feel like
you can make it as good by how you use
it and what you're filming and the
angles and the lighting but I'm pretty
happy with it it's a bit annoying how
big it is I'm still kind of getting used
to it so if you don't want to spend more
money definitely get this one this one
is great just because it doesn't have a
flip up screen and you get used to
knowing like where you need to put the
camera so you can see yourself and I'm
definitely not getting rid of this one
because I think if this one was a break
or anything or I'd lose it this is just
as good I wouldn't feel like I'm using a
backup camera so happy I got it because
I always like to update my equipment
but anything the quality is massively
different I don't know let me know if
you guys like the new camera and what
you think so I'm going to go get dressed
now I just had the camera on this tripod
thing while I was filming these are
called guerrilla pods are really handy
by the way I just don't know how else to
dress in this weather other than a
groots leggings 500 million layers and
like a big cozy cardigan so cool I want
to wear like every day so I'm gonna head
over to my parents now I'm excited to do
the film and just like get cozy in a
cinema I wonder if they do hot drinks
I'd love a cup of tea rich had it on
Radio one silly rich doesn't know about
smooth
enjoy this hello Gino puppy hello
whenever we greet her she just gets on
her back
it's like struck me hey my mom's made
crumble for dessert which I'm very
excited about you was excel at neater
than mine I never make enough topping
what's in it chicken tagine oh we've got
chriskiss we were at the cinema and the
film is called Christmas with the
Cooper's it sounds like it's gonna be
proper cheesy but good old rubbish
Christmas film with the only people in
the cinema it might just be because
we're early or might because this film
is really really bad we will see okay
just come out the film it was really
cheesy not amazing but nice feel good I
cried I always cry when people cry in
films and there were these annoying
teenage girls behind us that were just
talking and scum putting their popcorn
the whole way through it I know I was
that teenage girl once but still annoys
me a try really hard not to get annoyed
by it but oh I look quite tanned look
quite all of you don't I hmm this little
contraption is what I use to get my
footage onto my computer because this
MacBook Air doesn't have a slot for
memory cards so I use this and it's just
decided to break so I can't edit today's
video until I get a new one of these
which is a bit frustrating because I'm
going to Cambridge tomorrow for a
wedding but I've ordered one on Amazon
Prime and hopefully it will come soon
this is our dinner and I don't really
know what it is but it smells good I
think it's chicken and couscous and
stuff this is Juno's mad hour when she
goes a little bit crazy it's a little
bit naughty do you know
Oh
I'm gonna get myself some as it will
cooked my mom dad's now we had a really
nice dinner and Joe sugg and Caspar Lee
are on chatty man tonight but we're kind
of like driving and I'm hoping that they
won't be on until we get home so I
really want to watch and my support team
Internet I'm stressing a little bit
about what dress to wear to the wedding
tomorrow I suddenly feel like none of my
dresses are right and I wish I got a
long dress so I could wear flats reading
all your comments yesterday's vlog is
like stressing me out a bit about the
dress and I just don't feel I look
pretty particularly pretty or cool in
any of the dresses I have and the needle
and thread wall as much as I love it
it's nothing to do the way it's sewn
together I can't really do my arms off
in it and that's stressing me out as
well because I spent loads of money on
it and now I'm worried I can't wear it
to my friend's wedding so that I can't
dance properly say no one else just when
it gets the evening time I get really
anxious and stressed about the stupidest
little things so then anyone else get
that anyway I'm gonna head home now and
probably try on the dresses again that
Joe and Caspar chatty man Joe Casper
okay I'm gonna end the vlog here because
I haven't really got anything else to
say and I want to I need to edit this
vlog I haven't even started because that
thing broke so I'm going to sit in bed
while Rich's snoozing away editing this
vlog because tomorrow is wedding number
one so although this vlog may have been
a little bit boring
tomorrow we are heading to Cambridge for
a really good friend's wedding and I'm
excited we're gonna like roadtrip up
with a couple of uni friends and I'm
into a wedding in a little while I'm
excited I'm looking forward to it rich

not for you Alex

I've been laughed at in the lift at a
certain business district in London oh

bill of the day is why I get to wear
suits to work and get after and get
laughed at if you're not wearing one
