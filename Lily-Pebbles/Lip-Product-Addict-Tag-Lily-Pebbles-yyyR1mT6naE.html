the lip product addict tag and this tag
was created by two of my favorite
youtubers Emilia Liana and Essie button
and I absolutely loved watching their
versions so thank you guys for tagging
me and I'm gonna cheat my way through
this because it's impossible to answer
every question with just one product so
let's get started it was impossible to
think of just one but I have to mention
the nukes Rev de miel lip balm I
absolutely love this stuff it's very
different to other lip balms because
it's slightly matte and it's also a
little bit gritty so it's slightly
exfoliating as well I think I've been
through one tub of this and this is my
second it smells really nice it's got
really lovely kind of honey ingredients
and it's definitely one of my favorite
lip balms I also have to give a mention
to this lip balm a lovely subscribers
sent me this because she knew I was
suffering from sore lips and it's a
German product it's called Huffman it's
all in German says kinder cream which I
think it's meant for babies bottoms but
this is like the lip balm version and
it's amazing stuff I got it last week
and I've been using it every day since
it's properly made my lips so soft so if
you are German lucky you for being able
to get your hands on this stuff all the
time try catching red I'm gonna have to
say the Helen a cosmetics in Hollywood
red and I absolutely love this lipstick
I used to talk about it a lot I think I
discovered it in a glossy box and it's
completely random brand I never hear
anyone talk about but it's just the
perfect true red and the formula is
great it's pretty much Matt but it's not
completely matte and it doesn't budge at
all
I just find when I wear this it lasts
all evening and I kind of treasure this
lipstick if I were to ever finish it I'd
be really upset well it's obviously best
luxury has to go to and it's definitely
Tom Ford I think everyone has said Tom
Ford they are just serious luxury
lipsticks I'm very lucky I have three I
think I was given two as a gift and I
bought one for myself their proper
lipstick treats the packaging is to die
for is like this beautiful square gold
and black and it's lovely magnetic and
has that nice TF imprinted on the
lipstick my three favorite shades are
wild ginger which is a red with a nice
orange undertone and I think this suits
a lot of people is suits brunettes it's
people would like a cooler complexion
it's a really gorgeous shade I also have
cherry lush which is Tom Ford's like
true red and this is pretty much the
classic red I think it's such a
beautiful shade this one I've been using
from the back because I didn't want to
ruin the TF on the front and the last
time for shade I have a Spanish pink and
this is written ice it's something quite
different so I usually wear it's like a
really soft like pink but I think this
looks really pretty especially if you
have quite dark smoky eye going on this
pairs with that really well for best
drugstore I didn't pick a lipstick as
such it's more of a lip balm I love the
Revlon lip butters you guys know I talk
about them all the time
my three favorite shades are cherry tart
which is a red and is really easy to
wear if you're just getting into red
lipstick this is perfect because it's
slightly sheer this still has good color
payoff I also love sweet tarts which is
a really pretty pink in this one I find
really brightens up the face and it's
really nice to wear in the summer and
finally berry smoothie which is the one
I wear the most I've been through a
couple of these now it's just a great
everyday shade and this would be really
good to wear for school as well because
it's just like a tinted lip balm and my
lips but better kind of shade now this
one's hard I know you guys are all gonna
think I've chosen syrup which is this
one and it's probably my most used
there's like a tiny bit left but
although I wear this one the most I
don't think it's the most flattering on
me because it's still slightly too dark
I love it cuz it's easy to wear but I
think the one that suits me the best is
patisserie and this is like a nice kind
of soft peachy brownie pink it's just
the most easy to wear everyday shade and
I've pretty much nearly finished this
one - this one has to go to the lipstick
that started off the whole lip reaction
thing about I think it's over six months
ago it destroyed my lips and it's a
Maybelline lipstick I think it was the
14 hour where it was one that Lisa
Eldridge said was like her favorite ever
red lipstick so I was so excited to try
it but after using it once it just gave
my lips such such a bad reaction I don't
know what was in it so yeah that's gonna
have to our most disappointing I'd say
yes I don't wear it as much as I would
like to but when I have the time and
when I can be bothered I really think it
is worth it I
there's only really three lipliners you
need though for a red Mack cherry is a
great lip liner it works with most red
lipsticks and it's also really nice by
itself just all over the lips it's very
long-lasting for a kind of nude lipstick
which I don't think you need to wear a
liner as much that this was actually
reading us by itself as well I love the
charlotte tilbury reshape and resize lip
liner it's called her lip sheet and what
shade is this thin oh I think the shade
is lip sheet this is a really nice kind
of easy soft pink and you can wear it by
itself or with a lipstick and then I
love the lipstick queen invisible liner
and this is great if you have loads of
different lipsticks you wear all the
time and you don't want to have to buy a
million lip liners it's basically
invisible so it just leaves a wax
barrier around your lips so the lipstick
doesn't bleed and kind of smear all over
the place I think this is a genius idea
and it does work it's not a gimmick the
drugstore I've recently fallen
head-over-heels in love with the
Maybelline Color sensational shine gloss
these are so nice they're so pigmented
you'd think from like the soft shade
that you it wouldn't show up much but
the color really kind of shines through
and they're so pretty they're not sticky
at all I think they smell nice let me
smell yeah they smell really fruity the
two shades I have are 150 pink shock
which is very pretty brightening a
lovely summer shade I've really enjoyed
wearing this one recently and then 105
Kashmir rose which is a more kind of
easy to wear it's got a little bit of
shimmer in it which isn't something I
usually go for but it does look very
pretty on the lips and I think these are
really great kind of drugstore lip
glosses something a bit more high-end
how could I not mention my old love the
chlorine instant like natural lip
Perfector
these are great I've got about six
different shades of these and the ones I
have on me now a zero four zero five and
zero two these are great because they're
a little bit like a lip balm lip gloss
hybrid so they have this like foam
applicator at the end and you squeeze
the product out and apply it and it
feels so nourishing and comfortable on
the lips but it also leaves a really
pretty kind of sheen of color and I
think if you're someone who's not that
into lip gloss but you want something a
little bit glossy these are really good
options and they're so comfortable to
wear
the extra I wanted to mention the fresh
sugar lip polish I know that you can
easily make your own lip scrub but I
love this one I've got a few of them
flying around my bathroom and I've
always loved them they're so great it's
just a brown sugar scrub it tastes good
you just need a tiny amount you scrub it
all over your lips and then wash it off
and it really helps get rid of any dead
skin it tastes good and it makes my lips
feel great so that's everything from the
lip product addict tag I'm gonna tag
some people below if there's anyone left
who hasn't done it yet but if any of you
guys want to film it as well please do
and send me the link on Twitter I'm so
happy my lips have healed so I can get
back into wearing lipstick now and I
really hope you guys enjoyed watching
this video I'll see you all in my Extron
