channel today's video is going to be a
living room tour and I have really been
putting off this video we moved into
this flat in August last year and I
really wanted to do like tour videos and
all different things like that to do
with our new home and I just found that
I kept putting it off especially the
last few months when I knew I definitely
wanted to do this video
I just kept delaying it and what I've
realized is that I think a lot of people
who move into new homes find this you
never really feel fully satisfied with
your space I feel like I'm never gonna
feel like it's done there was always an
excuse the flats not tidy enough I
haven't bought that plant yet it's not
perfect and then I thought you guys
don't mind I think you'd prefer to see
it just how it is normally then like a
perfect living room it's by no means
perfect it's not exactly how I would
like it to be but I still love it so I
wanted to share our little space with
you guys and whenever I post Instagram
photos you guys always ask like what is
that from so I'm literally gonna talk
through the whole room tell you where
everything is from and show you kind of
before videos when it was empty if you
guys like these little kind of tour
videos I've already done a wardrobe tour
so if you haven't yet seen that I will
link it here
I talked through kind of my wardrobe
space and how I organize my wardrobe but
today I'm talking living room so when we
moved into this flat it had been done up
by a developer so it was pretty new
apart from the awful pink washed walls
the floor was new it was just kind of
like a blank canvas for us to work with
and that's what we wanted I knew I
didn't have time to like a big project
so it was more just about putting our
personality into things and just
changing a few things and furnishing the
place our living room is attached to our
kitchen which i think is quite common in
small london flats I really like it
because it means that while I'm cooking
I can be chatting to friends it's quite
sociable but it also means that we have
less space for like a dining room table
so we can't really have many people
around for dinner it's great for now
though so the room has like laminate
wood and floors and white walls we just
went like a plain white wall and it's
the brightest room in the flat it's
south-facing so it gets a lot of
sunlight which is great so let me just
talk you through the room I'm going to
start from where I am now and then talk
my way around the room so
I am sitting on our sofa and buying a
sofa is probably one of the hardest
things and not only do they take forever
to be delivered but it's hard to find
the right thing we are up some very
narrow stairs in our flat so we can just
get any old sofa sofa companies don't
put sofas through windows anymore I
found out so we had to buy a sofa that
was detachable do I mean that a sofa
that comes apart and can be put into
pieces so that they could reassemble it
in the flat which is really hard to find
because you wanted a really comfy sofa
me and rich spend a lot of time on the
sofa we watch TV almost every night so
after looking everywhere we eventually
found a sofa in a company called multi
York we knew we wanted something grey
something quite deep and comfortable to
sit on and it's absolutely perfect is
quite big for the space but it's a
massive priority for us and actually
it's worked out quite well because if
you take the cushions off we can
sometimes use it as like a spare bed if
we want friends to stay over so this is
from multi york it came to pieces they
bought it in a fan took it apart and
then put it back together in the flat
and we both absolutely love it the
christians are from habitat and H&amp;amp;M i
like to change the cushions up every
kind of season but at the moment i'm
going for the orange thing i feel like
it adds a lot of walk the room we've got
a lot of blue in here so it's quite cool
toned and I feel like the orange adds
some really much-needed warm hmmm home
is brilliant for cushion covers so you
could just keep changing them up
whenever you get bored the rug that's in
this room is from West Elm we really
wanted a rug because there's so much
wood and floor in this flat it can make
it feel a little bit cold and it's nice
to have some kind of nice soft texture
on your feet it's beautiful because it's
not you have to worry about like
staining it because it's quite texture
there's lots of different gray tones one
thing to note it does shed quite a bit
so we end up getting like fluffy balls
in the corners of the room which is a
little bit annoying but I feel like over
time that will kind of wear off so the
rug goes under the coffee table and
under the sofa just above the sofa are a
few pictures and we got this picture
shelf from Ikea and I love these because
it just means that you don't have to
hang things on the wall a lot of the a
lot of our walls aren't sturdy enough to
like bang nails into so this is a really
easy way to kind of change up your
pictures all the time without damaging
the wall at the moment we have three
pictures up there one is a photo
by my friend Steve Booker that I bought
online and I absolutely love it I think
he went for a walk with his dog on New
Year's Day and took that photo in the
woods the next one Anna bought me as a
present I absolutely loved it and then
the third one I got from a shop on
Carnaby Street that I absolutely love
and I will link it down below I'm
actually going to link everything I'm
talking to you down below everything I
can find
so check the description box for all the
details I'm not completely happy with
these three pictures and how they're
arranged I've got a couple of other
pictures I want to frame and see if they
fit better but as I said you could
always kind of play around with it and
that's what I love to do just to the
right of the sofa is a chimney breast it
has actually got like a fireplace in
there but it is there and we wanted to
use that wall as a way to make the room
feel a little bit bigger and the best
way to do that is by putting up a mirror
and my friend Hannah actually bought
this mirror for her new flat and I saw
her and I was like wow that is amazing
where did you get it from I thought
she'd got it from like an antique market
somewhere and she said IKEA and it was
like 90 pounds so I went straight to
Ikea to get it I loved it because it's
not silver it's not gold it's like
somewhere in between I really love the
detail it's a really big mirror and it
definitely makes the room feel a lot
larger I love it when I'm standing in
the kitchen I can kind of see in the
mirror and it just works so well for
this room okay so right in the middle of
the room is our coffee table and I think
the theme I was going for this for this
room is kind of wood and metal and glass
because those are kind of the three
textures I really like and I think they
work well together this coffee table is
those three things together it's got a
wooden base metal kind of structure and
then a glass top and the thing about
glass similar to mirrors of them is that
it makes room feel bigger if you have a
lot of solid items in the room it can
just clutter the room make it feel
really small so we went for a glass top
it does mean you have to clean it more
often but I really like this table there
are two quite big drawers which is great
for storage our flat has no storage at
all we haven't got attic we hardly have
any cupboards so everything we bought we
wanted to have storage as well and then
under the glass you can kind of store
things there as well and display some
pretty things I have this West Elm tray
again it's not perfect I feel like I
haven't really put
think particularly nice on it yet but
I've got a couple of succulents and some
pro annoyed voters I'm hoping to frame
soon like a pretty bowl and some candles
and those just sit under there and then
I've also got some coffee table books
I've got my blogosphere magazine and
then some books from ranking I know this
book is controversial and everyone gets
angry at me but I really love this book
it's full of some amazing photographs
and ranking gave it to me personally so
I love having it out on display and less
my nieces and nephews come around and
then I just kind of swap it over so it's
not on the top okay so moving over to
the TV area I know a lot of people don't
like having the TV as a main focus in
the room a lot of my friends kind of
chose not to put a TV on the wall
because they don't want it to be the
main focus me which watch quite a lot of
TV and we are in the flat
just us two most the time so we wanted
to make the TV quite like a big thing in
the room why not hey so it took quite a
while to find a TV stand that fitted in
this little space that we have this one
we found from a calm it took forever to
arrive so that was a little bit
frustrating but it is perfect it's kind
of I think 60s style it's white so it
really just blends in with the wall it's
got a nice wooden leg so it kind of
blends in with the floor and again it's
got storage space it's got two drawers
that we can fill with things and then a
space for our Sky box and Rich's Xbox
the TV's Samsung we got it from John
Lewis with vouchers it's huge and great
we love it above the TV when we moved
into this flat there was a boiler there
and it was just the most ridiculous
place for a boiler you would think that
the boiler would be over by the kitchen
but instead they kind of took up the
beautiful space where we could have had
lovely shelves and it's just too
expensive to move a boiler we looked
into it so instead we wanted to come up
with a way to cover the boiler without
taking away all that nice space so we
actually got someone to build a cupboard
around the boiler he covered the pipes
below and made these beautiful cupboard
doors I asked for it to be shaker-style
because it kind of goes with the windows
and our flat so it has a border around
the edge we painted them all white their
shelves inside so on the left is the
boiler and on the right we can still
like our iron and any kind of cleaning
supplies in there and I bought little
the handles from and the pond
and we just got him to put those on so
they're white they blend in with the
walls but the handles are a little bit
special the cupboard works out really
well and I'm so happy we did that okay
so moving round to the left I have this
little stool and I actually got this
from Soho farmhouse when I was there I
had a little voucher for the store so I
picked it up as I said we don't have a
proper dining room table we've got a
small table two chairs so we try to have
spare chairs where we can I use my
office chairs sometimes and then this
stool comes in handy as well we can use
it as a little stepladder and as a spare
seat but at the moment we just have this
terrarium I think that's what it's
called on top which looks really pretty
I don't think it should really go here
but that's where it is at the moment I
forgot to mention by the way just down
there by the sofa we have this little
kind of copper basket that I got from
home and pantry and we have loads of
throws in there from like H&amp;amp;M and West
Elm
I love having loads of throws around but
if we get cold we're on the sofa and I
just think they look really nice as well
to decorate the sofa we wanted to have
some extra seating as well this sofa can
sit around three people comfortably but
we often have friends around so we
wanted to get another chair and I wanted
to get one of those huge love seats but
I didn't want to block out the light
from the window either so we ended up
just getting an armchair this is from
West Elm I absolutely love it it's quite
a pale gray so we don't tend to let
people sit on any spaghetti bolognaise
that's all I'm gonna say but I love it
and it's so comfortable
and we have this cushion on top that I
got from a shop in home when I was with
Anna called Gigi I think it's called but
I love it it's just a beautiful kind of
powdery blue color and then as you also
might have noticed on our windows we
have shutters now this was a big
decision for us we have these huge
windows and this is the only room in the
flat that I can film videos in so I knew
that I needed a way to control the light
I felt like covering the windows with
curses would be such a shame but
shutters are really expensive we got
these from Hillary's blinds where they
come and they fit them to the shape of
your window and they advise you and you
can pick whether you have one of those
things that goes up and down
how many shutters you have how wide or
small they are and in the end we ended
up not getting some other things so that
we can instead invest in the shutters
and I'm so glad we did it completely
changes the
it really goes with the style of the
flat and it makes it so much easier to
control the light and give some nice
privacy as well because otherwise people
opposite can completely see into our
lounge so I'm really happy with those we
just went for plain white shutters and
then moving around the room we have our
painting and main which actually bought
this in the South of France
in I think it was old Antibes markets we
bought it before we even knew we had the
flap but I knew that when we did get a
flat we'd want to have some art and I
didn't want to just go and get any old
thing from like IKEA that everyone has
and I saw it and fell in love and just
hoped that it would fit somewhere in our
flat and it fits perfectly on this wall
it's quite long and narrow but it's the
painting of a girl standing in the sea I
love the blue swishy tones and colors
it's completely up my street and every
time I look at it it just makes me so
happy
below the painting we've got a small
table it kind of looks quite big but you
really even fit for people that are
squeezed but two people comfortably so
we kind of use it to eat breakfast it's
breeches working from home he'll sit
there sometimes they film in front of it
as you guys would know it's a marble top
table from West Elm with dark wood legs
and then we also got the matching chairs
to go with it and I love this I love
marble I don't want to overdo it with
the marble but I think it's the perfect
amount to go with the kind of glass
metal and wood that we already have on
top of the table I have some pretty
flowers I like to put in a kiln ajar and
a very sad looking fruit bowl that has
really quite sad for you in it so then
we had this space to the left and why
ideally would have loved to do is extend
the kitchen but it's quite hard to do
without blocking the window and we
thought about having a little breakfast
bar there we had loads of different
ideas and in the end I saw these shelves
on West Elm and thought actually that
would be a great area for some shelves
so what I did is I got the shelves from
West Elm and then the pipe underneath is
actually from Urban Outfitters it was
only 35 pounds it came with a shelf but
I just detached the pipe and attached it
to the bottom of our West Elma shelves
so I think it looks really cool we have
three shelves this is the part that I'm
least happy with because I just haven't
found like a pretty arrangement on the
shelves it's just not a priority for me
at the moment normally we have a really
pretty ivy plant that kind of hangs down
the shelves but that died and I
having bought a new one at the top we've
got this kind of herbs print that I
bought from Ikea I think it's really
cool actually for an Ikea print it kind
of goes with the whole kitchen Rich's
weird kind of glass coffee thing we've
got a fake grass plant from Ikea in a
marble pot we've got a money pot that's
in the shape of lips I've got this
random gold pineapples I got from Oliver
bonus some spaghetti and then on the
bottom shelf we've got tea avocados an
orange bowl recipe books and then some
little glass bottles so it is the shelf
of randomness there is no order to it
and that's something I definitely want
to sort out if you guys have any tips
for like styling shelves please let me
know just below the shelves we have that
pipe where we like to hang like our hand
towels and sometimes we have a basil
plant in that empty sad pot there and
below that we have our bin which I love
our bin we got it from John Lewis it
took a long time to buy the bin boring
adult decisions we have to decide what
size bin to get we went for this one I
really like it has two sections I use my
label maker to differentiate between
recycling and everything else so that's
the living room I'm not really going to
do like a kitchen tour yet and we still
have some bits to do but I'll kind of
give you an overview of the kitchen we
basically just added the tiles and
that's all we really changed and we also
added a dishwasher which is why there's
that awkward space next to the
dishwasher which we haven't decided yet
what to do with it but that's our living
room and I hope that was kind of
interesting and not boring for you guys
