just don't know what the day is this
whole week I keep thinking it's the day
ahead so today feels like Thursday but
it's Wednesday I have a lunch meeting in
town today and then tonight
me and rich are going to a screening of
a new film I think could while we're
young and it's a Ben Stiller film and
that's it like seven so it's silly for
me to come all the way home
so I think I'm gonna stay out on town
which is a bit annoying because it means
I'm kind of wasting an afternoon there
are a few things on my list that I want
to get I'm in proper spendy mood at the
moment I don't know what's happened to
me all I want to do is buy new clothes
for spring I think it's the Webber it's
definitely improved in the UK and today
actually I'm wearing I'm so happy with
my outfit this is a big statement but I
really feel like for the first time ever
oh my god this bit of hair for the first
time ever I feel like I've put together
the perfect outfit and I'm completely
happy with what I'm wearing and it's
actually quite different so I normally
wear so I will show you that in a minute
I bought some new trousers that I'll
show you but I think I'm gonna have to
do a haul video soon because I have
picked up quite a few pieces over the
past kind of month or so so I'm gonna
like write a little list on my phone and
if there's enough things to talk about I
will do clothing haul video for you guys
just looking at the straight so I
printed this of my near my mum from the
video that we did on Sunday and love
this photo it's so nice I've got back
into printing photos recently I also put
this one of me enriched in a frame that
Anna took I really like that so I'm just
gonna finish getting ready I need to put
on a lipstick and a C's and breakfast
and then I probably gonna head in this
town yeah I'm gonna attempt to show you
my outfit so this is a cropped top but
is it's really structured this is from
cause and I haven't found that many
things to wear it with because it is
cropped by got these trousers yesterday
from whistles and I'm completely in love
they were really expensive but they're
doing the 25% off with Gracia things it
wasn't that bad I feel like I don't have
any good black trousers that's something
worth investing in so they have a little
zip and they have pockets and back
pockets as well and then they go all the
way down or this is such a terrible way
to do an outfit and then I'm wearing my
flat thing is at all those shoes so I
hope you didn't get your blisters
hopefully I can take it out for floats
at some point today and show you
properly and wear
rock myself as well I just really like
this outfit very happy lately although
I'm wearing a vest top under my crop top
so that when I go like this you don't
see my tummy and I feel like that super
lame and I'm in such a granny thing to
do but just don't want to be getting my
tummy out I think I'm just gonna have a
plum for breakfast I'm so not a
breakfast person I really like but
muesli and but it's just I was to keep
forgetting to make it you have to make
it the night before that's probably the
only thing I like sometimes a bagel but
I'm not that hungry and I've got a lunch
meeting in like two hours so I'm just
gonna stick to that long okay I just did
a little bit of email checking but I
have to leave now and I think I'm gonna
pawn bit of lipstick I'm gonna wear I'm
obsessively Chanel lipsticks I know I
talked about though in my last blog this
one it's Coco and I do really like
Arthur and which is more of a true red
but Coco has a slight orangie tint to it
which i think is nice but when it's
sunny I'm just gonna dab it on because I
don't want to put on too thick I'm just
gonna give a nice tooth to the lip so
I'm gonna do that now there you go
I think it's really pretty
I myself just now and I'm just gonna
head to my lunch meeting which is in the
chalet keeper
finish my lunch meeting it was really
nice it had some tiger prawns they're
really garlicky so I think I'm just
getting to meet Rich's mom and sister
who are in London for the day should be
really nice secrets
right I haven't moved quite a few hours
so it's all Ritchie's mom and sister
and then I found every shop and I sat
and did my emails and I listened to
Tonya radio
now moving around and I'm wearing like a
shoe shoes and their robot I know
we need to work it out working on the
film I can't wait against
starting point seen her passionately
funny 20 is everyone else's at the
insurgents from
it's like this like crazy big film not
going through it no it's like this big
letter smell a knife I turn that down
because I was like that's really scary
oh I know I'm going to like a little
tiny screaming number one instead and
the machines are at less despair are
they can detain Richards gonna kill me
am i scary those people look as I passed
by premier dresses it's not a perm I
wanna see
okay
okay the films over and we're heading
back home and I really like to actually
it felt like a little like indie film a
murder think it was I was also quite
short it was like a nice nice form
actually I really enjoyed it too you
enjoy yeah it's nice to just sit in the
cinema or not look at my phone throat
over actually haven't done that so we're
gonna head back home now
good morning guys it's the next day it
is Thursday this week I'm so confused
with days I've just got ready I'm
actually wearing the evil on tinted
moisturizer today that I spotted June
B's chat live had to give it a go and I
really like it actually um welcome to
makeup always looks a bit funny at first
yeah it's nice and dewy and fresh and a
very nice kind of weekend face what else
my wound just like matte eye shadow
haven't put any lipstick on yet kind of
boring makeup but I'm wearing my River
Island
Ashley jeans these kind of little
trainers from Topshop and my cos top I'm
just not feeling black skinny jeans and
boots at the moment I'm not sure why
it's obviously the good weather but I'm
not even sure if this out that's very
flattering because they're kind of like
baggy jeans which doesn't make me look a
bit big around here but I'm gonna give
it a go
today I am going to Sloane Square with
my grandma and my mom we are going to
the Joe Malone store because they have a
Mother's Day gift in service where you
can get your favorite perfume put in a
box with like these beautiful flowers
I'll show you when I get there but the
lovely people that german-owned asked if
I wanted to bring my mom and my mom's
been treated plenty of times so I asked
if I could bring my grandma instead and
it's her birthday soon she will kill me
for telling you but she's gonna be 85 I
had to tell you because she doesn't look
anywhere near that age I'll try and vlog
a bit one with her she's a bit camera
shy so I'm really looking forward to
taking her there and treating her to a
nice day I think we're gonna go for
lunch afterwards as well you can never
make it quite down to the kitchen before
getting destructed by my office it's a
really bad habit just gonna do a couple
of things before I have some breakfast
this is why my recycling bin is always
full okay we're in Sloane Square and
we're gonna head into the
nice hand massage and pick a perfume
you
we had a really nice time in the
jamie-lynn store and they have their
nice arm massages and they actually both
people say percent which sage and Cecil
which is my favorite as well we
obviously have the same taste and now
we're going to go get some lunch and
pan-canadian or madhavan my street
okay I'm home now and I've actually got
loads of work to do it's preposterous

Saturday plan I really struggle with

the Disney law and it was so so far me
