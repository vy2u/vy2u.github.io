vlogmas day 16 as you would have noticed
no blog of us went up yesterday and
that's because I was really really ill
after the Carol concert and I went home
some of you noticed that my voice
changed quite quite suddenly and I woke
up the next morning with a full-blown
cold at XI I went to bed that night I
couldn't sleep so I had such a block
nose and I certain the entire day
yesterday on the sofa I didn't have rich
hair or my mom and I really felt quite
sorry for myself and really angry I get
really angry when I mail because I get
frustrated that I can't do what I want
to do and I had to miss an upload but I
just try to take easy because I'm going
to Vienna today and I needed to be
better for that so today is Wednesday
the day I go to Vienna and I don't feel
100%
I feel really weak and quite like
sensitive and everything I'm doing is a
slow motion but I feel much better than
yesterday oh I'm sorry
talking when you've got blocked noses
hearted blog I just feel bit pathetic
really but I have to go and I really
want to go and see Jake and rich and
I've paid for my flights and stuff so
I've just spent the morning
slowly packing my stuff up I've got my
hand luggage stuff here I'm still use a
sandwich bag I like my passport and all
that boring stuff and then my suitcase
I've just got like a handbag
lots of jumpers I'm not really taking
anything I'm gonna go for a holiday so I
just need like jeans and a couple of
jumpers and then like skin care and
makeup and all my camera charging stuff
just exhausted I feel rough but I'm
hoping when I get there I feel better
you commit myself some breakfast the way
that I can tell that I'm not better yet
is that every time I stand up and do
something I just want to sit down and
relax because every tiny little thing I
do is exhausting I'm gonna have to get
the tube to Victoria and then get the
Garrick Express to the airport I just
really hope I make it I'm gonna leave
early I'm so scared of flying and I'm
flying in my own which I thought like
when I booked I was like man up Lily you
can do it but I didn't know I'd be ill
now I'm really really hope I'm okay I
packed really quickly so I'm just
sitting down to watch a film which is
like a way thing today but I just have
no energy to do anything else like clean
flat it needs cleaning or do some work
I'm watching the pentatonic stop
cementery pencil it's a really cool like
vocal group I think that you describe it
I'm enjoying it so far my cough started
so I come out and it sounds really like
chesty cough I'm just gonna pack up my
hand luggage so I'm gonna put in my
laptop my clear plastic bag which has
strepsils hand sanitizer this works deep
sleep stress less rollerball a mini
perfume and my lipsticks like gloves my
oyster card my purse my passport my
headphones my memory card adapter and
the lead for my external hard drive and
a mirror mirror in there I'm gonna have
some of this ben'll in chesty cough
non-drowsy stuff took yesterday and it
tastes so gross so haunting me explain
it's revolting everything I've really
explains why me and Richard going to PLO
rich actually went on Monday for work
because the company he works for they
have an office out there and then I
thought while he's there I'll go out and
visit him because our best friend Jake
you might remember Jake from other vlogs
is living there at the moment he's an
opera singer and Vienna's like home of
the Opera so we're gonna go out and see
him and see his place and he's got an
opera on Thursday night I think we're
gonna go to so that we're really nice
and it would be nice to catch up with
him I'm only going till Friday night
short and sweet but I'm really excited
to go to the Christmas market oh my god
I look so terrible today I've like
hardly put any makeup because I can't
bothered
excuse my face I'm gonna leave in half
an hour about one o'clock on my death
alone quick snooze
I'm all ready to head off now so let's
head to Victoria I'm now in Victoria
Station I'm gonna get some water and
snacks before you on the Gatwick Express
I just realized I forgot to pack of
socks
no one's I'm wearing a really spotty and
thinkin annoying I just drop my bag off
and now I need to go get some money
change but no your first time I haven't
very security my gate isn't gonna be
announced for another hour so I'm just a
little crunch shopping and then sit and
absolutely fine as long as I'm so happy
I didn't notice in the browser so I was
gonna get some cheese and chill here for
a bit
my god look at me I've landed in Vienna
and I've only flown a couple of times I
can't anything I'm saying when he flown
a couple of times by myself so I'm proud
that I did it but landing was so painful
on my ears I was crying and the people
make some thought I was the complete
weirdo and now I can't hit anything that
anyone is saying but I'm here rich and
Jake are here and now we're gonna get on
the train
really : there you go I hate not be able
to hear try not on Broadway years we're
in our hotel room now and I'm gonna
spruce up my face looking oh my god I
can't hear anything it's really hard to
vlog when I can't hear anything
I never know if I explained properly
when I was in there earlier I used to
always yeah I used to always suffer from
really bad ears when landing I'm playing
that up till I was about 12 I used to
cry so much on landing and the same
thing happens and I was crying and I
know I couldn't explain to anyone what
was happening anyway we're here now
we're in the hotel and I'm eating what
am i eating
so it's from restaurant we went to
restaurants today all this shooter was
it's like bone broth beagle broth Woody
Allen was there the other week oh Jesus
right birthday thank you welcome
so you served it like that dishes and
then they feel the broth you do it for a
romantic date 'ln yes I forgot spree
mascara the one thing I forgot to bring
and with two boys who don't understand
what that means
Oh that'd be so annoying as the plastic
about it really so weird that mascara
it's quite late it's like ten o'clock so
not much is open and we're not really
sure what we want to do because all the
fires are going to be smoking which
won't be good for me when I'm this ill
so I think we're finding some ways to
have a nice cup of tea and just go
walking around there's a huge grass for
a little bit of wine over Elgar I don't
think that's a very good idea to go out
it's very cold out there and I'm tired
and not well so we've come back to the
hotel and I'm going to edit this vlog
maybe finish watching the film I was
watching on the plane which is painful
towns I'm really enjoying it and then go
to bed and get a good night's sleep so
that we can enjoy it or I think we're
gonna meet up with Jake I'm gonna try
and upload the vlog views and his
internet in his flat and then have a fun
day out and go to Christmas markets in
the afternoon and it's really like
watching him in his opera I'm gonna
finish vlog in here so I can edit the
vlog and tomorrow we have to find
mascara then warning the boys like we
don't need it
girls you understand the scar is the one
thing we all definitely need in our life
I'm happy to be back with rich
night-night do you have any thoughts
very cold highlight of the day arriving
in Vienna and seeing Jake stuck on her
thing right No</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
