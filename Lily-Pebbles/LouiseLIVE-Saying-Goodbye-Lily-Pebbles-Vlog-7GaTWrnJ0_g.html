after the kids this weekend because of
my sister's party and I think they've
just arrived Bailey is here
cuz he's saying he's having a sleepover
aren't you have you been so means that
way here's where what's in it as you do
our first task of the day is to go to
the supermarket and buy all the food
that we need to make good I just spent
about 10 minutes thank you for a card
for my dad I decided to get this one
which says dad was overwhelmed with all
his tweets now if only you could figure
out had someone back he's always asking
how to use Twitter the same card is made
we've done our tester shop and I'm just
snacking on some olives I'm trying to be
healthy today we're not healthy I'm
trying to eat not so much gluten or none
if I can because I had some weird
reaction recently to a pastor pizza and
I haven't been feeling great so I'm just
kind of doing a little test to see how
it makes me feel now we're gonna head
back to Joe's and make some guacamole
Joe Joe used to be a kid's party planner
so she goes had to throw a good party
and she's currently setting up the party
planning she's doing a little sweet bar
those different sweets and even what the
hell do you even get these things out of
my lovely neighbor Alison and chocolate
fountain and Cici bags away from London
eBay but they do do Vince I go and if
I'd known that I would have gone really
cool this is the worst day to try and do
gluten-free look at all these sweets the
mailroom riches setting up the chocolate
fountain I just open the fridge to see
if I have a snack
those look like vodka jellies to me I
asked her if she had enough
tortilla chips think that's about right
let's show you the size
they're that big we're now in town and
we got to oh my God my legs Russell
Square cheap station he said 175 steps
in the lift that was acute we took steps
oh my God my thighs my legs actually
shaking that was really really hard
we're gonna try and find some ones I
have some food first before Louise's

just started to rain down full bitch
just walking through here looked up and
you see a man abseiling down the side of
this building hey where's he gone oh my
goes up there
crazy crazy man and drone flying
slightly
to keep an easygoing fire into a bunless
burger and sweet potato fries you have
for the skinny burger but then will jet
prize

we're going to lose breathing eating at
a coffee store Street expresso yeah go
and then flat white no you do flat white
with soya milk this place looks pretty
cool but walk into the show it's just
telling me about his dream but I had to
get my camera out to share tell us a
dream wait wait I guess a dream so it
doesn't like I didn't actually think
about it yeah you did good so it was
like we're in a meeting this boardroom
meeting and it was like loads of people
and then and I started taking joke
taking the mickey out of people in there
some reason and then this girl starts
chipping and then I looked round and it
was Rita roar and all right and then we
just started getting on and just being
like having banter we hit it off him and
Rita Ora yeah that in yeah that's pretty
much it and then we went out party and I
think through central London and just
find an amazing church just just right

wonderful name for a moon that ends that
one moon dance I sung that as a solo a
few other solo bits as well a freeze
Gary for a sixteen-year-old to be on a
big stage at a theater so that's my

employer's giving me a lot of sweets not
