for today's video I'm going to be doing
a first impressions swatch and review
type video I don't do this very often
but when something gets me excited I
just want to share it straight away so
today I'm talking about the new retro
matte liquid lipsticks from Mac they
look like this and I spotted these in
store before I went skiing and I thought
Oh visit those are interesting I wasn't
really sure that they were new and then
I kind of went away and did some
searching on YouTube realized they were
brand new my still actually put them out
early and I was so gutted I didn't get
them I checked in the airport on the way
to France and they didn't have any so
the entire holiday I spent thinking
about these and obsessing over them and
watching every review on YouTube so the
minute I got home I went straight to
Phoenix Mac and I bought five colors so
I only put these up yesterday I've been
trying them I tried them a bit last
night and I've been trying them today
I've literally just watched every single
color I own so apologies if my lips look
a little bit beaten up but I'm going to
talk to you guys through what I think so
far and a little bit about the products
so this is what they look like I really
like the packaging personally there's
been a lot of split opinions on the
packaging some people absolutely hate it
I really like it I really like the size
and chunkiness of it I think it's cute
that they've kept the MAC lipstick lid I
agree it kind of looks a little bit out
of place but I really like it and I like
you can see the color of the lipstick
inside comparing the packaging to my two
other favorite liquid lipsticks which
I'm going to refer to a lot in this
video this is the Kat Von D everlasting
lipstick and this is the Sephora lip
cream the Kat Von D one I find far too
long the wand is too long for like a
precise application although I love this
lipstick and the Sephora lip cream is
okay but I'm at nothing special really
so let me talk about the actual
application wand I really like the Mac
one it's a sort of diamond shape which
makes it really easy for when you're
applying it and getting right to the
edges because I find that the the tip on
this is really good for the corners and
the edges I say it's the best tip
compared to the other two the Kat Von D
one is just a doe foot applicator and as
I said I find it far too long and the
Sephora lip cream is also a dopher it's
quite large so it can get a little bit
messy the Kat Von D everlasting
lipsticks for 20 dollars which is about
13 pounds you can't actually get these
in the UK yet and the Sephora lip creams
are $14 so that's a bit more affordable
at around 9 pounds again you can't get
these in the UK yet hourglass opaque
Rouge a 23 pounds so those are a bit
more similar to the Mac ones I really
don't like those though I find them so
drying so much I actually got rid of all
of mine because I found it uncomfortable
to wear and the Mac ones come at 21
pounds so I think that's quite expensive
I would have preferred this to be around
the 15 pound range as you can see I
bought quite a lot and it came to so
much money I wanted to buy them so I
could do this video but I think in the
real world I wouldn't buy more than like
one or two maybe because it's just
that's really expensive they come in 15
shades which is quite nice I think it's
a decent amount I hope that they add
more in the future I don't know if they
will I think is missing a few key shades
so I picked up five pretty much all the
ones I wanted apart from there was a
really nude one I cover what it's called
that I really wanted they didn't have it
they had the more peachy nude so I got
that instead I'm going to talk you
through each shade and how they felt
when I applied them and show you some
cutaways of what they look like on so
the first one is back in vogue and this
is one of the nude shades that they have
it's a slightly more peachy one I don't
think this suits me that well but it's
nice to wear I found that one pump
did your entire lips you didn't have to
keep pumping it back in and this one
sets very quickly and it's a really good
everyday nude I find it when nude creamy
lipsticks just rub off really quickly so
it's nice to have something matte and
nude and this shade didn't go blotchy I
didn't have to blot it it just applied
really smoothly and nicely the next
shade is quite the standout and this is
one of the more orange you Reds
orange Reds don't usually suit me that
much I find because I'm so dark I do
quite like this one I did find that as
soon as I applied it it was quite drying
and cracking it showed a lot of fine
lines on my lips so if you do have very
dry lips with lots of fine lines these
probably won't be good for you I
definitely find these more drying than
the Kat Von D and Sephora lip creams but
I also find that they set much quicker
I say between like 10-15 seconds and
they're completely set so set that you
can take your hand swipe it across your
mouth and I'm not joking nothing will
move so if you're after that
long-lasting four
that you can eat and drink this is
definitely that I don't have ever tried
a liquid lipstick that is so
long-lasting so this shade is a really
pretty orange red that I think will be
one of the more popular shades I know
that the nude that I couldn't get was
the first one to sell out in my local
max store so I don't know if that's a
kind of global thing but I think the
noodle be really popular as well the
next shade is fashion legacy which is
more of a true red I always like to pick
up a true red in a collection because
you can't go wrong with a red lipstick I
did find that with this shade it's very
unforgiving the formulas quite
unforgiving I found that it's quite easy
to get on your teeth and if you make a
mistake kind of have to just go with it
when I applied this one I sort of over
drew my lips a little bit
you can't backtrack it's so hard to
remove this formula that you kind of
just have to go with it so for this look
I had quite large lips accidentally I do
really like the shade though it's a
really pretty true red and I found with
this one I didn't have to layer just
kind of one layer was enough the next
one is dance with me and this is a
really pretty dark red I really like
dark Reds I did find with this one that
I had to reapply it twice I find that
what happens with the darker shades is
that your left or the sort of line
around your lips which looks really
weird so what I tend to do is just blot
it with a tissue and then reapply and
that's fine it doesn't take up too much
time it looks much better once I put the
second layer on I really really like the
shade but just so you know these liquid
lipsticks are impossible to remove I
found that the only way to remove them
is with a cotton bud don't try and use a
cotton pad don't try and cleanse your
face because it will go all over your
face and it won't come off easily use a
cotton bud dip it in waterproof eye
makeup remover or if you have a my sila
water they're waterproof makeup removers
definitely better and then just roll the
cotton bud around your lips and you've
got to do that I went through like five
cotton buds per application you just
have to roll it with the wet side and
then roll it with the dry side and the
lipstick sort of crumbles off but
they're definitely hard to remove so be
prepared for that and the problem with
that which I also found with the
hourglass liquid lipsticks is that if it
does wear off after like four or five
hours of wearing it you have to reapply
it you can't just let it fade like a
normal lipstick and then go for
something else you're kind of stuck with
it for the night you can reapply these I
don't think maybe
your pliers nicely as the Sephora lip
creams or Kat Von D everlasting
lipsticks they do get a little bit
crumbly a little bit dry and
uncomfortable on the lips but I think
they last longer initially that if
you're just going out for dinner you
might not even need to reapply them the
last shade is the one I'm wearing now
which is a lady and it's like a dark
purple I thought this looked really nice
I think there's a more purpley one in
the collection as well but this one's a
bit more wearable and again I found
because darker shade I did get that line
around the edge I had to blot and
reapply but once I'd applied it I think
it's a really nice kind of vampy plummy
color I really like this one actually
it's a little bit different great for a
night out but because these dry down so
matte and they're so easy to wear I
think you can definitely get away with
wearing them during the day if you're
not one for matte lipsticks because you
think they look too drying and too heavy
I think these would work great as a base
as well especially the nude one if you
apply this on your lips first and then
apply a gloss on top at least you know
when the gloss phase you'll still have
color on your lips and I think a thin
layer of these would work good as a base
on your lips
so I'm not sure what else there is to
say I've told you the price how many
color shades there are I've shown you
the ones that I bought and at the moment
it still feels really comfortable on the
lips I'm going to leave this one on all
day and I'll add in the description box
if anything drastic happens I'm going to
try and eat lunch and dinner and stuff
with it but they feel comfortable on the
lips they don't feel too heavy like our
glass ones they don't feel too drying
they're not the best for reapplying I
love the packaging and they're a little
bit too expensive that's kind of all my
opinions there so I hope you guys found
this video helpful I'll link below the
video that I watched because I always
think it's good to get different reviews
different perspectives and let me know
if you guys have tried these and what
you think of them thank you so much for
watching I'll see you guys in my next
video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
