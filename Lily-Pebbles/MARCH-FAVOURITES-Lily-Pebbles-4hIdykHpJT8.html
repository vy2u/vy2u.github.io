be filming my March favorites video this
is actually the first video I'm filming
since I got back from my holiday you
might have already seen another video go
up but I don't always film in order so
I'm sitting in my bed I thought I would
get comfy today I just wanted to sit and
chat to you guys about my favorite
products on the last month you may have
noticed that I do my monthly favorites
video kind of mid month and that's just
because I feel like for you guys I know
it can get a bit boring when you have to
watch kind of 1020 favorites videos one
after the other so I like to upload on a
different day to everyone else and I
know that makes it seem like it's not
the end of the month yet but I basically
just do it from the last time I filmed a
monthly favorites video so there's
always a month it's just not always
exactly the whole of that month if that
makes sense I have lots of honeymoon
related products this month for obvious
reasons I'm gonna get started with my
Muji packing key i watch one of Ingrid's
packing videos years ago and invested in
some of the Eagle Creek packing cubes so
these are just well as it sounds the
packing cube is zipped open put your
clothes in it and it just makes it
easier when you're traveling around
especially so when I was younger my mom
used to always do this we had clear
tubes and she'd put tops in one dresses
and others just so just to unpack your
whole suitcase every time you move these
are quite expensive though and they're
quite thick which makes them a little
bit heavier once they're filled so I
recently found some in Muji and I really
really like these because they are so
like light and flimsy if you're not
using and used to dispose of up into a
tiny ball they come in all different
sizes I've got some little ones for like
bikinis and underwear and I got some
bigger ones for clothes and as I said um
it's just so much easier we traveled
around a lot on our honeymoon and it
meant that every time we've got to new
hotel I didn't have to unpack my whole
case I could just grab the packing cubes
that I needed and it makes life a lot
easier but yeah I think use a great day
I think they're quite affordable I
currently remember but I just really
liked how breathable and lightweight
they are I thought up quite a few videos
whilst other way actually if you haven't
checked them out please go check them
out because some reason when you're on
holiday videos just don't get great
views maybe cuz it's not you're not like
pushing them as much or people know
you're away I don't really know but
please go check out those
if you haven't seen it yet one of them
was about long-haul flight and my tips
and how I deal with it and in that I
mentioned neck pillow and I got so many
comments asking for a link to the neck
pillow I thought I would mention in here
I got this recommendation from Fleur and
one of her videos I've never really been
into these next pillow kind of things I
always feel like they just give you a
really bad neck but this one is really
great
it's called memory soft I know you've
got on Amazon it wasn't cheap but it's
so worth it like for an overnight flight
makes you sleep so it's kind of like
memory foam which means it's just a lot
bigger than some of them have like beads
in them and I feel like they just don't
do anything so this one is really big it
clips together here and then you like
don't even really have to move a neck
much to fall asleep I found this helps
so much on the long-haul flight I just
went on it really made sleeping a lot
easier when you're like sitting in a
chair you're not lying down on a bed and
its really soft as well as I will link
this below to anyone who wanted to check
it out ok SPS now you guys might think
I'm a bit crazy I have three SPF to
recommend this month but I just really
think these are the perfect bike trio of
Sun creams you don't need all three
obviously but this is what I really like
to have with me on my holiday
the first one is Dafa it's just a Sun
cream in SPF 30 and I really like to use
a cream on my body in the morning when
I'm like in my hotel before I go out
because I feel like I get a really good
base layer all over I find that applying
cream when I'm like on the beach or by
the pool or out and about is quite
difficult so this is the one I use when
I'm in my hotel room or flat or wherever
and I apply all over my body it's thick
but not too thick it rubs in really
nicely I really trusted our fan as a
brand and I really like this one this is
almost finished I kind of brought it
back with me just to show you guys why
is on my body when I'm out and about is
from a brand called cooler seeking get
some cult beauty you can also buy in
Sephora and this is the tropical coconut
defend there's quite a few different
scents but this is so easy because it's
a spray like an aerosol spray and it's
clear so you can literally just spray
all over you date and really need to rub
it in but if it kind of sinks straight
into the skin this is the one I like to
use when I'm by the pool or on the beach
or walking around in the Sun this is the
handbag size there is a big one
I like to use a cream first and use this
one from when I'm like on the go and
it's so great and then for my face I
like to use the LA roche-posay Anthelios
XL and this is in 50 SPF 50 I really
like to use a high SPF on my face
because obviously you don't want to get
like a leathery wrinkly face when you're
older really like the little cute
packaging of this and this is a bit more
like a fluid silky feeling rather than
like a heavy cream so it's also good if
you want to layer it underneath your
makeup now I'm moving on to my music
favorite of the month I think it's going
to be an obvious one with its EDT
Sheeran's new album divided I really
like Ed Sheeran he's maybe a little bit
too poppy for me but I feel like I'm
quite invested in him I remember when he
was like doing local gigs in Camden he's
also from the same kind of area where
Richard from in Suffolk and I don't know
I feel quite like proud but he's British
and he's doing so well anyway I really
like his new album he said in an
interview that he wanted it to be quite
schizophrenic so he wanted it to feel
like it's a bit all over the place and
doesn't flow and you can definitely tell
that each song is quite different and is
inspired by his year of traveling I've
read quite a few comments and people who
said that the Irish inspired songs make
them cringe
I'm not Irish I personally really liked
them but I can kind of see that maybe
they're a bit like stereotyping but I
really do think there's some great songs
on there I really like Dai I really like
go away girl I kind of like the war
really I said there's only like two I'm
not that into and also the singles or a
bit like overplayed now I really like
the songs that John Mayer does the
guitar solo on and I said to rich when
we were listening to this over and over
and over again on our trip and I said
this one just really sounds like a John
Mayer song and I read in an interview
that it was John Mayer playing the
guitar so I was pretty proud of myself
okay let's go on to some makeup
favorites these are new from Clarins
they are the skin illusion blush and I
got certain leaves just before I left so
I took a couple of them actually I took
one with me on the trip and they were so
so handy okay let me show you comes in
this little pot and you screw off the
lid and it kind of like
fancied a go if you can see that inside
the lid is the product it's a cream
blusher and on the other side is a foam
applicator so they kind of press
together and then you dot it on your
cheek and blend it out it comes in three
shades a pink a crawl and a kind of nude
now they're not of perfect blushes I've
read some of you say they're quite
patchy I agree they can be quite patchy
but they're so practical and easy that
it's kind of the perfect blush to travel
with
I loved it for the days where I just
want to wear a little bit of makeup
identity to go pat pat and then either
with my finger or brush I just kind of
blend it in and if you're quick with the
blending it doesn't get patchy I think
they're really cool I think it's really
clever spring/summer and I can't pick
which one to keep I know I don't need
both them I feel like 0-2 might be
better because you're a one's a bit more
pink Sarah too is a bit more like nudie
Coralie I think they're really really
cool definitely worth checking out I'm
not sure if they're out yet but they
should be out in spring I also fell back
in love with my absolute favorite cream
bronzer someone commented somewhere on
my Instagram maybe saying that this has
been discontinued and if it is I'm going
to be distraught because every summer I
just bring this out and I forget how
much I love it
from YSL and it's there Lissa Harry n
cream bronzer or I should don't have
it's called a cream bronzer healthy glow
bomb powder mine is disgusting because
I've used it so so much I think I have
another one maybe in a slightly
different shade but this is just so good
in the summer I'm actually wearing it
today because it gives most natural
bronzy glow it makes it look like you've
actually been sitting out in the Sun I
use the Real Techniques contour brush
and I just put it along my cheekbones I
actually put it over the bridge of my
nose along my cheekbones on the edge of
my hairline and it's the most like gooey
glowy lovely delicious bronzer I just
think it's so so good the perfect
holiday bronzer ever final makeup
product is by Becca this is a travel
size I think I may have got in Sephora
it is the shimmering skin Perfector in
opal so this is a liquid highlighter and
it just looks so nice like I might do a
video on my honeymoon
makeup actually I may have already put
it up I might film it tomorrow and put
up Wednesday if I have I will link it
above because I just wanted really
natural dewy glowy make up for the days
I was actually wearing makeup which
wasn't that many days but
if I decided to and this is just a
little tube of liquid let's take a
little bit my finger and then just pass
it into the skin and it just meshes with
the skin you can use a wet sponge to
blend in and it's gorgeous opens a
really nice shade I just love all of
Becca's highlighters I think mayor
brilliant and this one is really nice
okay a few more random favorites before
I wrap this up the next one is the
camera lens look at this beast I rented
this lens from Jessup's I really wanted
to take the great camera lens with me
for safari but I didn't really want to
invest in a lens like this because I
just don't think I'll ever use it again
it's a brilliant lens but I just know
what I'm liking it too big and heavy
I'll never take it out this is the canon
70 to 200 millimeter 2.8 in it's a zoom
lens so Jessup's actually rent out
lenses which i think it's brilliant so i
rented one for safari thing i had to
take out a separate insurance and
sausage to make sure like he took a
stolen or anything but it worked so so
well I'm going to insert some of my
favorite images I took on safari whilst
I talk now and I did look like a bit of
a camera enthusiast bringing this out
but I loved it I'm not used to having
such a wide kind of lens are you still
using a fixed lens like a 50 mil so it
was so nice also to be a slight zoom out
and really see the whole frame and it
zoomed in all the way to 200 so you can
get really close you can get massive
like detail and the animals faces I
tried not to take too many like
close-ups because I think it's nice also
to see the scene around the animals but
it was brilliant I really really loved
using this lens of so glad that I took
it with me and I was highly recommend it
and I hope you guys enjoyed seeing some
of my photos the next favorite is a film
that I watched on the plane it's called
I Daniel Blake and it's brilliant you
have to have to watch it I don't want to
give away too much I'm really bad at
describing films but it is an English
film about a man who is stuck in the
benefits system so it's kind of in limbo
where he can't work but he's not doing
benefit because the benefit system
thinks that he is able to work and it's
very emotional and sad and touching and
important and it makes me think a lot
and I just never really seen a film like
it I think it won a lot of awards that
it definitely deserve
those awards finally Willoughby's if any
of you have been to Cape Town or you're
from Cape Town Willoughby's I can't stop
thinking about this place it's a sushi
restaurant it's surrounded but in a
shopping center which I I would never
think somewhere great would be in a
shopping center from the VNA which is
like quite a touristy part of Cape Town
but everyone said you have to go to
Willoughby's for sushi so I went it
looks like a deli doesn't even
particularly look very like Japanese I
would never ever have gone there without
a recommendation but oh my god I've
never ever tried sushi like and I I live
in London where there's really really
good food but it's I mean the food in
Cape Town in general was incredible but
this place Willoughby's the sushi was
like their son called salmon roses in
South Africa which we don't have here
which is salmon sashimi wrapped around
tuna sashimi it's unreal there was like
a crispy rice sushi where they had sushi
with like crispy rice on top and then
like the rainbow rolls
it was unreal I can stop thinking about
it I'm so upset I genuinely want his
book the trip back to South Africa back
to Cape Town just so I can go to
Willoughby I would eat there every day
if I lived in Cape Town it was unreal
now no other sushi will ever compare so
that was my final favorite I really hope
you guys enjoyed hearing all the things
I've been loving this month I'm excited
to be back feel a little bit more like
inspired to make more videos I'm
thinking I might take a step back and be
a bit more relaxed with my upload
schedule just so I could work more on
better videos maybe I don't know I feel
like just before I went away L got a bit
of like a emotional YouTube
rollercoaster where I was kind of
feeling on the edge of quitting a little
bit I think it happens to all of us so
I'm just kind of working through that
and figuring out what I want to do as
always if you guys have specific videos
you want me to film just let me know and
I think that's about it for today so
please don't forget to subscribe I'm
very close to 400,000 subscribers I
think and that would be really exciting
I think that would give me a bit of a
confidence boost so please subscribe if
you haven't yet I'll see you guys in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
