today I'm gonna be talking to you about
my March favourites and I've got quite a
long list of things are quite a few
beauty products so what I actually did
was when I was doing my makeup I filmed
some cutaways of me putting on some of
the products so that when I talk about
them you can kind of see what they look
like when I apply them so let's get the
beauty stuff out the way and then I've
got non Beauty stuff to talk about as
well this foundation has been a
revelation for me I absolutely love it
it took me a while to find my shade
because there are lots which is amazing
but I finally found the right shade so
this is the new NARS foundation it's
called the natural radiant long wear
foundation I used to be such a fangirl
of NARS sheer glow until one day I was
getting my makeup done and I told the
makeup artist I was wearing oz shade
glow as she was like that is far too
heavy and matte for your skin and I was
like matte how could we matter could
shake glow and she was like it's just
named really badly so after she said
that I kind of realized that it was way
more matte than I thought it was and I
prefer a kind of medium coverage but
glowy foundation and that's exactly what
this is it isn't too light it's not like
a kind of glossy a skin tint type thing
where it doesn't really cover your skin
it gives you that nice coverage but
doesn't look heavy on the skin and it's
got a really lovely glow to it so that's
what I'm wearing today I am the shade
Vienna I thought I was do bill because
that's what I used to be in shade glow
but they didn't have so many shades back
in the day and now they've got Vienna
which i think is like in-between
Deauville and maybe Fiji or something so
this is the perfect shade for me
Deauville was a little bit too light and
this is just perfect
sorry by the way that I just look so
kind of overexposed I'm sitting right in
front of the windows we have no shutters
yet so my entire road can see me filming
so I'm gonna look a little bit more pale
than normal but I might prefer like
natural light so anyway this foundation
is great I've been wearing it everyday I
used up my little sample they very
kindly sent me the full size and I just
definitely think it's worth trying when
I did my space inkay event I recommended
this to so many people I've also been
absolutely loving a new bareMinerals
concealer this called bare Pro it's a
stick concealer and it's like a really
creamy formula it's very similar to the
by Thierry CLIC stic that I absolutely
love I'd say maybe it's a little gives a
little bit more coverage it's more
fuller coverage but again not came
you can just swipe it where you need it
I use a beauty blender to just kind of
pop it into the skin and then if I need
a bit more I'll use a brush
I love how small the packaging is and I
just think it's a really really great
concealer again I think it comes in
quite a few shades but I'll link all the
products I'm talking about in the
description box as always next up for
makeup is the Urban Decay Naked petit
palette so this is the mini version
actually I've got my draw here this is
the Naked heat palette the original
which is huge obviously very
inconvenient for traveling I absolutely
love this palette my favorite shades are
probably these two sourced and low blow
and then I love these kind of middle
ones as well so for me the the mini
isn't perfect
I personally or first so I can never
open it up oh there you go I
accidentally dug my nail into one of the
colors
I don't really use two lighter shades
and I wouldn't use this darkest one I
love these three in the middle so I
would have added in maybe like one
shimmery one it may be another light
warm one but not that light it's not
perfect but I love it in this shade here
which is hot spell I wear every day I've
literally worn it every day since I got
this palette I also love a wild thing
I'm wearing both of those today I love a
warm eyeshadow I just feel like I don't
need palettes this big anymore but this
is perfect I really like it I don't
think I've talked about this product yet
but this is the new brow shaping gel
from hourglass for our new brow gels and
I'm never that like blown away by a brow
gel I love them from blink brow bar my
criteria is that it just doesn't leave
white bits in my brows I always go for a
clear brow gel so I guess I don't have
to be as fussy as people who have less
hairs on their browser actually want
something that gives them like thickness
but for me I really like this one
because the brush is really interesting
on one side it's really small and flat
and on the other side it's really long
bristles so I feel like on certain parts
of the brows you need like a little
brush and then on other parts you really
need to brush through the hairs so I
think that's really clever I've never
seen anything like that before I love
the little packaging again it comes in
four shades I think but I just use the
clear one and I think that's a really
great brow gel so if you haven't found
one
like yet I think if this ago I find that
some like the boy brow and the benefit
one the brushes are too tiny for me like
if you have big eyebrows you need an
actual extremely brush so this is great
if you saw my skincare video which I
will link above I'm not even going to
point because I point in the wrong place
every time but I will link it above if
you haven't watched it yet I'm loving
all of the products I mentioned in that
video but I just thought I would
highlight two of them I won't go on for
too long because I've already spoken
about them but the skin suit circles
eh-eh-eh intensifier this is brilliant
it's such a gorgeous serum
it really helps boost the hyaluronic
acid into your skin and I've been loving
it I'm halfway through dreading the day
that I finish this but it's so good and
the other products that I wanted to talk
about it the Clinique CX soothing
moisturizer I've got lots of questions
asking if I'm still using the dr. jart
ceramide in and I am I still love that
they're a little bit different the dr.
jart ones a little bit thicker and I
find that this one is a little bit
cooling and soothing on the skin so when
my skin is feeling a little bit sore or
not itself this is so nice it's just a
really really lovely moisturizer so I'm
really glad that Caroline recommended
that to me before anyone asks I know you
will you're gonna say what am I wearing
on my lips I am risking having sore lips
because I just really wanted to wear
lipstick it looks so much better doesn't
it anyway this is Charlotte Tilbury
pillow-talk lip liner and the lipstick
on top is the Laura Mercier spice rose
which I bought years ago because Tanya
burr wore this on her wedding day and it
really is the perfect lipstick color I
love it so much Thank You Tanya for that
recommendation years ago I should
probably buy a new lipstick okay that's
all the beauty stuff so let's go on to
other things that I've been loving this
month first of all my maid calm poof my
mom ordered this for my 30th birthday
back in November and I think it came
around February time and it was so worth
the way it's gorgeous is like a pale
dusty pink velvet poof and it's
difficult to find the perfect poof I'm
really struggling to say poof over and
over again it just sounds wrong but it
is the perfect height the perfect
firmness so we use it both as an extra
seat for having people around and
there's more people than we have space
for someone can sit on it but me and
rich user
most every night to just rest our legs
on I find the one I'm sitting on the
sofa putting my legs up just is so much
more comfortable on my back and we have
a glass coffee table so we can't really
pop it up on there so we share it we put
our feet up we watch TV and I love it
just think it looks great as well it
adds a bit of color into our lounge and
yeah I'll link it below because I really
really like it the next thing I've been
loving is hellofresh we've been doing it
for three weeks now I think doing like
the book period when we just didn't have
time to do any food shopping or anything
we were eating so unhealthily and
hellofresh
actually went to my parents house and my
dad signed up a month my mom was like
what are you doing my mom is such a good
cook they really don't need to sign up
but they did it for like one week and my
mom was like even though it's not for me
I think you would really like it I think
it's perfect I reckon it's aimed at
people just like me and rich we are
young professionals we are very busy we
like to eat well and we can cook but we
just don't really have time to think
about it or plan it so every Sunday we
get delivered a box and we've chosen to
do three or four meals a week I can't
remember and we pick our meals every
week and it all arrives in a box and you
can go straight into the fridge and
everything's all ready in like separate
bags for that meal and you've got all
the right spices or the right quantities
and all the food is really like good
food is all like organic and great so
some of the recipes that we've got well
the more Hicks that's the best thing you
can keep them so you can make them again
and it has like a picture of what it is
and then it has step-by-step
instructions on the back so you've had
like chicken tagine green curry Chipotle
spice chicken pork and apple burgers
they were so good veggie shepherd's pie
I am loving it we are loving it it just
works so well for us like now I'm out
the book thing I'm like we're still
doing it I think we're paying like 25
pounds a week or which worked out it was
like six pounds a meal or something so
it's not crazy expensive compared to
like what we are already spending on
food shopping and takeaways we were
having so many takeaways so yeah it's
really working well for us and I'm
enjoying kind of learning how to make
new recipes as well it's kind of taking
me out of my comfort zone and
encouraging me to cook things I wouldn't
normally cook and then I actually doing
it I can tell like why does this
shepherd's pie taste so much better than
when I make it and I can see the
ingredients have gone into it and yeah
it's just making me learn more about
cooking sorry I just need some tea a
style favorite that I've been loving is
this shirt from and other stories and
really gorgeous silk shirts it fits
really nicely it's not like oversized in
the wrong places it's not too tight it's
black silk with white polka dots and I
love it just tucked into high-waisted
jeans this is one of those things I know
I would just wear for years really happy
I got that oh another style favorite
these trainers it's not nice the whole
train is up to your face let me just
hold one they are pink suede adidas
actually they're not suede they're like
cool Jory now I'm looking at them closer
I mean they're a nightmare yesterday I
wore the minute rain until I was like
this is not gonna go down well I did
manage to like wipe off some of the mud
they're just gonna get dirty but I love
the shade of pink it had some really
nice color to my outfit I love wearing
light colors like if I'm wearing like a
yellow t-shirt or pink trainers I love
wearing it was like a lighter denim I
just think it looks really cool I don't
love the contrast of wearing like black
with pink trainers but if I'm wearing
like a light outfit with my camel coat I
think they look really cool and they're
really comfortable I will link them down
below I am just loving trainers as
always okay my final favorite is a TV
show and I have a TV show every month to
recommend to you guys it's making me
realize how much TV we watch but we just
do mean rich watch TV every night pretty
much for that fail unless we're out it's
our way of relaxing and we just really
enjoy getting into like new series and
just seeing what's on TV I'm one of
those old-fashioned people that
literally just flicks through the normal
TV channels and watches what's on I'm
loving on born every minute that is back
and I have another recommendation but
I'm gonna save it for next month this
month I want to recommend season three
of love obviously start from season one
if you haven't it's on Netflix
we love to season one and then season
two if I'm honest we did kind of like
stop watching it for a bit and like just
we weren't that into it and then season
three came out and we were like oh my
god we never even finish season two so
we went back and watched it and season
three is so good it's like a really kind
of quirky indie feel series it's very
funny it's a comedy if you like films
like knocked up and things like that
you'd like it because I think Judd
Apatow is a the director and so it's a
very similar feel to like knocked up
what other comedies has you done like
this is 40 a few films like that I'm so
sad that I
I hope there's another season we are
just like going through things so
quickly so if you guys have any other
recommendations please do let me know so
I think that's everything those are all
of my favourites for March I'm gonna try
to do some more vlogs you guys love my
vlog on Wednesday thank you I've really
enjoyed editing that one it took me like
four hours which is ridiculous because I
have so many other things to be doing
but I really like spending time on
editing because I think that's where you
can add your personality to videos and
me you can constantly evolve and change
and I just think it's an important part
of being a youtuber so I enjoyed doing
that vlog and thank you so much because
you guys obviously enjoyed it as well
which is amazing okay I'm gonna go get
on with my day I need to go buy some
gray paint samples I was you guys in my
next video thank you so much for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
