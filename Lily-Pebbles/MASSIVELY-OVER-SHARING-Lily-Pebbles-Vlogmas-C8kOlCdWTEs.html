off of vlogging Monday and Tuesday I
just stayed at home and got so much work
done I uploaded a whole video on Tuesday
instead of a vlog so if you haven't yet
seen that I will link it if you want to
go have a watch funny because I asked
for everyone's opinions because
obviously I do like it was opinions but
man as a youtuber you definitely have to
get used to like the overwhelming amount
of people saying that something looks
bad on you I really like that whole
videos I hope you guys did too
today I have a fun day in town Anna's
just messaged me to say that she's
really early so I'm gonna leave early so
I go keep her company but we're actually
doing a biscuit ears biscuit icing class

favorite like dessert brands they do the
most incredible biscuits I can't wait I
really hope we get to eat lots and we're
actually doing a class where we can
learn how to do the icing I'm so excited
I think it's gonna be so fun my sister's
so jealous that she couldn't come but it
is a class that you can sign up to so

gift why didn't I get that for her for
Christmas damn it this morning I've got
a meeting with Anna we've got a few
meetings actually throughout the day but
then we've got the icing class which is
the exciting part today so I'm gonna get

degrees today and sunny feels warm how
weird

escalators seriously Who am I
someone said it's because I'm a
Sagittarius and we're in Sagittarius a
month that I'm like feeling so good and
positive and sprightly I don't know but
I hope it lasts I'm on the hunt for a
letter box because I have quite a few
thank-you letters to post I can't seem
to find one anywhere yes I found one
today thank you hot what the hell it's
December sometimes London weather is so
weird I can't deal with it we are here
riding house cafe one of my fav London

lunch but wherever food food
the stores I can surely hey we finish
breakfast really yummy and we come back
I'm gonna look at my peer box and we've
got some meetings and now come at you

in the secret video waiting video okay I
need to find my peer box oh yeah oh gosh
I also have a sack full of products huh
maybe Anna can help me go through this
we're gonna go in for a meeting now
today's basically today's vlog is gonna
be time-lapse everything because nobody
doing anything I just went through my
peer box and the some really good stuff
in there that I will show you when I get
home later but I also got sent the new
blogosphere magazine which has throw me
on the front so I'm gonna have a look at
three now so us going on in here we are
now heading I am so excited by heading
to a biscuit ears
I seen the class I told you guys this
morning I love this it is to get this
really all good we've got to go to
nothing Hills it's like three different
tubes so we're gonna try and get there
in time the classes at three Cypress
levels well though I did we're really
late but I think we're here we're trying
to find it
look so much harder than it looks look
at my terrible reindeer but this wagon
went well we realize it depends on the
piper thing and how big the hole is
they're going in the oven
we've just finished the biscuit ears I
think last and it was so good we took it
really seriously but I really enjoyed it
and I'll show you my biscuits properly
when we get home I'm home blinds so
everyone can see in when I'm making my
dinner you know I'm filming this this is
boring if you guys need to turn the
Christmas lights as well that you find
Christmas trees without lights on just
so sad good I had such a nice time at
the biscuit ears biscuit class should I
show you my biscuits now do you know
what I'm not going to show you right now
because you saw when I was doing them
obviously but I want to take an
Instagram photo tomorrow and I don't to
like touch them all and then have to put
them back in summer I'm going to leave
them in the box tonight and then
tomorrow morning I'm gonna get them out
take a photo and then ask off my face
it's that time of the evening I need to
tie my hair up I literally like the
first thing I do after get me into comfy
clothes tie my hair up I can't have my
hair down when I'm at home whoo I'm just
gonna wash my hands because I'm gonna
make dinner for me and rich he's still
at the gym so I'm gonna be a good little
housewife and make him some dinner
because I'm really not that kind of
person we normally just do it together
tonight on the menu it's spaghetti
bolognaise with spot spaghetti also look
what came for us today
I haven't actually seen this which sent
me a photo this is from Razia Rossi and
Jukes and so she was our wedding
photographer she was absolutely
brilliant and so so sweet and kind so
she sent us this beautiful box and
inside oh my gosh this is so cute inside
it says thank you for sharing your
moments with me love Razia so these are
the two USB sticks with all our photos
on she sent them to us ages ago like
online but these are just so we have a
hard copy and then some of the photos
I've been so bad I haven't printed any
yet we're gonna get a book made if any
of you guys have any good
recommendations for like good quality
wedding photo books let me know I think
I found when I lie
but I always want some recommendations
that one of the barn I love that one of
Hana oh honey
gorgeous table rich being flung up in
the air me do my speech
Jojo crying rich laughing what do I say
oh I know what I said us watching our
video me rich SJ I'm Rob dancing and
then the one of me and which walking
down the aisle the super Posey one of us
walking love that Rich's jacket had red
inside that's it
those are so cute I love them Thank You
Rosie oh if you're watching I don't
think she will be but thank you okay for
the polonaise I'm actually gonna use
mushrooms I don't normally but rich
likes mushrooms in the bottle a so I'm
gonna add that and I'm actually gonna
add a bit of carrots
I don't usually buy these sort of
carrots to make bolognese but we have
them because we bought some humus
whatever I'm going to use some of those
onion garlic
and then I'm going to add my mints and
chopped tomatoes and it should be pretty
simple just a lot of chopping cue the
time-lapse slowly the Karma the knife
will learn
I never thought that I would be drown
this is wrong people keeps missing the
clouds seem to fail bolognese sauce is
made and I'm gonna let that kind of
simmer and cook for a bit longer gets
extra flavor some I was just drinking my
water and I thought I'm sorry this is
like massively TMI but I don't care so I
hope you guys don't it's 7 o'clock and I
have only weed twice today once this
morning and once when I just got home
is that normal because to me it's normal
but sometimes I see people like going to
do a weed like multiple times throughout
the day and I think I actually drank
quite a bit of water today like with
every meal I had water maybe not loads I
don't know some days I just we like once
or twice interesting this is the best
spaghetti ever even if you can eat
normal white spaghetti this doesn't need
me feeling bloated at all I started
eating it because white pasta kind of
made me feel a bit rough so I got spelt
spaghetti back see I love this now I've
got my family on it it's so much better
Oh guys I'm feeling so frustrated at the
moment and I'm not alone I think a lot
of creators youtubers are just feeling
so frustrated at the moment because
YouTube have just been like I don't even
know what's going on but a lot of
people's videos aren't going into
people's subscription boxes the views on
a video are showing like half the amount
of views there actually are which I
guess sounds like it isn't a problem
because as long as you have you know so
my video from last night is showing that
it has 25,000 views but if I look on
real time it's showing 40,000 which I
guess isn't a problem but I think a lot
of people might look at a video and see
that it doesn't have many views and side
not to watch it and it's not all about
numbers of course it's not but this is
our job and it's important for us it's
kind of like let me think of the
equivalent it's like if you had a normal
office job say you worked for three days
on a piece of work and you've left on
your managers desk and then someone
threw it in the bin and your managers
just never saw it and that was the end
of that that's kind of how it feels when
we work hard on a video and it doesn't
go into people's subscripts and boxes
and not many people see
and it's just it's mad it's so out of
our control something that's so
important for us it's very frustrating
and youtuber saying that we should
encourage people to turn on
notifications which means that you get a
notification on your phone every time we
upload a new video but I don't think
that's a solution because I personally
watch loads of channels and I don't want
loads of notifications my don't expect
you guys to have that just from my
channel either so I don't know what the
solution is I guess just kind of check
back to my channel or follow me on
Twitter snapchat where I tend to Twitter
and Facebook or the ones I always share
my videos on there it's just really
frustrating it's kind of like what is
the point of making the content if not
everyone's seen it and people you know I
don't know I find it really annoying god
my battery's flashing I think it's cause
of all the time lapse I've been doing
today rich just messaged say he's gonna
be back late and so I'm gonna eat my
bolognaise throughout him he can heat
his up when he can heat he can hate he
can heat his oh my god I can't say it he
can heat he can heat his own up he can
heat his up when he gets home oh I've
got my spaghetti bolognaise here and I'm
gonna sit and watch The Santa Clause I
love that all the Christmas movies are
on at this time of year obviously I'm
gonna try and like savor every mouthful
because I feel like sometimes with pasta
I just eat it so quickly because I love
pasta that I don't even really like get
full because I haven't processed that
I've eaten it I'm gonna try and save on
my meal put my phone and camera away and
I think I will chat to you guys again
tomorrow thank you for watching today's
vlog and I'll see you guys tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
