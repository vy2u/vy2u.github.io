favourites video sorry if there's any
background noise in this video but I've
got all the windows open because it's
pretty warm today but it's so nice and
sunny which I am very happy about I'm
wearing my nice summer dress this is
realisation path any of you that wonder
because I get this question a lot I have
my realization power dresses in a large
because they come up very small I was
gifted these dresses they are very
expensive not sure I would spend that
much of my own money on them but they
are really nice good if you have big
boobs because they wrap around lovely
summer dresses anyway that has nothing
to do with this video I'm gonna talk
about my favorite things from this month
which again is like a mix of beauty TV
and other random stuff okay so let's do
the Beauty first and the first thing I
want to talk about is this from jo
Malone and it's the black bear Bay
shower oil I've had this for quite a
while it's lasted me a really long time
because you only need a tiny amount this
is a very luxurious product you know
usually I wouldn't spend that much on a
shower product but I wanted to recommend
this because I really think is worth the
money whenever I use this in the shower
which isn't always kind of like special
occasions or a fresh shower before going
out or if I like no I'm gonna see people
I'll use a bit of this and without fail
I always get complimented and I always
get asked like what are you wearing your
smell so good so it definitely lasts on
the skin which is impressive because I
normally only put it on like a little
bit on and then a shower off it's the
same scent as my perfume so it also
works really well to like layer the
sense but it just the scent lasts really
well on the skin and it's a really
lovely oil you put it on and it kind of
turns into a bit of a white milk and I
just love the smell of blackberry and
Bay it smells really clean it's so
refreshing so I would definitely
recommend that that would make a really
nice gift as well actually the second
product is a skincare product and it's
from Paula's Choice which I haven't used
much from Paula's Choice and if I'm
honest the kind of packaging and
branding doesn't appeal to me that much
neither neither does the name but the
products are really good Caroline highly
recommends them and the best part is
they're a hundred percent fragrance free
so this is her skin perfecting 2 % bh a
liquid solace ik salicylic i can never
say that word salicylic acid so this is
a bit like the pixie glow tonic you
put on cotton ball like on a cotton pad
and then you sweep it over your skin and
it's a chemical exfoliant it takes off
that kind of layer of dead skin but
because it's 100% fragrance free it's no
added dyes no animal testing it's
clinically proven to be non irritating
it's really good for sensitive skin
types I'm really enjoying using this I
only use it once a week at the moment
but it really it really works I don't
use like a physical exfoliator like
anything kind of gritty I prefer
something like this this also came from
my bathroom this is something I've used
for years and years and years but I've
just didn't have ever spoken about it
because it's not kind of that exciting
but I just had to order some more so I
thought I would tell you guys this is
the blender cleanser solid so this is
from the Beauty Blender brand although I
actually prefer the Real Techniques
sponge but this is just such a good way
to clean it I feel like a lot of you
guys probably have makeup sponges but
either don't clean them or don't know
how a lot of my friends they'll finally
kind of get on the sponge bandwagon but
no they'll just use the same one and
never clean it and if you think about
kind of how gross it is that the sponge
you're like making it damp and you're
putting on your face and getting makeup
in it it's just gonna store so much
bacteria if you don't clean it so I
clean mine kind of every two goes that's
why I have a few so I can kind of
alternate so you open it up and it comes
like this it's got this little kind of
griddle grid griddle pad thing that you
can use I don't use that so I just put
that to the side and then what it is
basically a solid bar of soap obviously
you can use soap I just these really
work well for me so what I normally do
actually is just kind of keep it in the
pot I'll wet the sponge and then I'll
kind of push it around and here making
sure I get all the sides and then keep
squeezing out under the water and it
only takes a couple of goes and it
really cleans the sponge as well I've
heard of some weird like microwave trick
with very liquid but I'm just not into
it so I really like using this I did
have the big black one that was like a
charcoal one which I finished and I just
ordered a couple more of these from coal
beauty and I think that's the best way
to clean my sponges personally I came
onto makeup well this is kind of like a
skincare makeup hybrid this is new from
Kiehl's and I'm so into it it's the
Kiehl's glow formula skin hydrates
it says with pomegranate extract
instantly illuminates skin and provides
antioxidant protection
you've got SPF in it no this is
basically like it comes out a cream like
a creamy liquid and it's a bit bronzy so
it's kind of tinted but very glowy and I
love mixing this with my Becca primer so
I'll put them both together because this
one I find doesn't spread that easily
over the skin so the back of primer kind
of loosens it a bit I'll put a pump of
each and then just rub it all over my
face as a primer for my foundation you
can also use this at the end and just
kind of tap it onto your cheekbones down
your nose as a highlight it's such a
gorgeous like glowy moisturizer if
you're not into like serious
highlighters this is a really good
alternative also I think this would be
great for mature skin types so I think
that's a really good launch from Kiehl's
Pro excited about that and now I've got
a couple of makeup bits as well this I
mentioned in my last vlog it is new from
Chanel's part of their new lab age
collection and it is the bronzer I
absolutely love this bronzer it's got a
mix of like mid-tones this kind of
peachy stripe that runs through its and
darker bronzes so I just mix them all
together and I'm wearing it today and
it's just the perfect bronzer for me
it's very soft and easy to blend and
because it's slightly ready toned it
gives you that kind of real sunkissed
bronzed look which I really like this is
definitely gonna be my new favorite
bronzer for the whole summer
I can just tell and this is from it
cosmetics again I'm wearing it today I
would come a little bit closer this is
the superhero mascara and I think it's
brilliant it gives really gorgeous like
fluttery lashes they're quite thick and
black but they just give really nice
shape the bottle tube is kind of a funny
shape it's a bit big for me but the
brush is just kind of like long and it's
like not a plasticy wand it's not a big
fluffy one it's like somewhere in
between really really lovely this
mascara I've only been using it for a
few days but I know it's gonna be a
favorite I came on to style favorites
first of all is this necklace which is
from Miss Ouma this is part of the Lucy
Williams collection and I absolutely
love it I've had my eye on it for so
long the soma sent this to me and I'm so
so grateful because I just know I will
get so much wear out of it so I love
their jewelry so much they've got so
many different
necklaces and earrings I love their
earrings as well so definitely go check
out my soma if you haven't yet and then
for style if I had to pick one thing
that's a favorite from this month it
would probably be this dress which is
from and other stories I'm gonna insert
photo here now of me wearing it at the
BAFTAs I went with my friend Deb's and
with makeup forever it was a really fun
night and you guys know me I don't like
to be overdressed I don't really like
getting dressed up that much I'd always
prefer to be underdressed and
overdressed but this is kind of
somewhere in between it's red so it's
striking and looks like you've made an
effort but the shape means that it's
like a little bit more casual it's not
like super tight it's not like
floor-length it's just a really nice
kind of smart casual summer dress I'm so
glad I got that from and other stories
so I will link that down below
and as always if you're interested in
other items of clothing that you see me
well on Instagram or wherever check out
the shop link on my blog I will link
that down below as well and that's where
I put all the clothes that I wear ok the
next thing I will talk about our
podcasts I have been so into podcasts in
the past month I have been into podcasts
for a year at least but something's
changed over the past couple of months
for me and instead of kind of watching
videos whilst I do my makeup I have been
listening to podcasts I just feel like I
can get more done when it's just sound
and it's not something I have to watch
and I'd have to keep kind of pausing it
and starting again so when I'm doing my
skincare and I'm doing makeup when I'm
cleaning when I'm making the bed I've
probably got a podcast on and I wanted
to recommend a few that I've been
enjoying this month first one is the
high-low which is dolly Austin and
Pandora Sykes and there's just so much
going on they basically sum up pop
culture and news from that week and they
give their opinion and they also
interview guests on it there seems to be
so many different elements going on but
it's very well edited so it doesn't feel
overwhelming and it's something you can
definitely come back to I really like to
have that one on where I'm driving so I
can concentrate because I feel like I
learn quite a lot from that podcast they
are just very clever girls who use very
clever words and I always finish the
podcast and end up like googling words
to find out what they mean and then
being like mmm interesting so I really
like that podcast then x1 is from fern
cotton and it's called happy place the
happy place you have your place
I think it's just happy place hmm I will
link all of these down below she
interviews other kind of famous
well-known people but with the topic of
talking about mental health and again
really interesting I feel like her
podcast is probably the most formal one
I listen to it's very traditional kind
of old-school interviewing but she has a
very calming voice and it's nice to
listen to every now and again I really
like the one she did with Tom Daley and
his husband that was a really good one
the next podcast
I want to recommend is couples therapy
it's a brand new podcast from Casey
Neistat and his wife Candis I forgot her
name for a moment it's really good
because they just have no ulterior
motive they just want to sit and chat
and be quite honest about their marriage
and their feelings and I love the kind
of banter they have with each other
I love Candis I think she is just so
cool she's so real I feel like we would
really go on and be friends I really
want to be her friend but definitely
goes is that one if you're Casey Neistat
fan I think you kind of see you hear a
different side to him and then the last
one is Giovanna Fletcher's happy mom
happy baby which has just wrapped up for
the season I haven't got a baby I'm not
a mom but I just it's really interesting
to hear other kind of famous well-known
people talk about them at their most
kind of vulnerable or state and the
struggles they have with motherhood as
well as the kind of bits that they enjoy
in love I feel like actually it's a
really good podcast to listen to before
you have kids because it's a bit like
having an older sister I feel like I've
heard a lot of these things from my
sisters if you don't have a lot of older
sisters then I feel like these ladies on
happy mom happy baby podcast will kind
of give you a bit of an insight into
what it's really like to be a mom so
those are my podcast recommendations and
then to finish up this video I want to
recommend some TV shows because I've
always got so many to recommend to you
guys and this month is no different the
first one is called save me Lennie James
wrote the series and he also starred in
it and he is so brilliant it's about
again a young girl who goes missing I
feel like I watch a lot of programs like
that but this one was much better than
Carrie which is the one I recommended
last month it's I wonder how I can
explain it
his daughter goes missing or the
he's never met or known his daughter
because he left when she was very young
and I think for a while people think he
is the one who has taken kidnapped his
daughter and he spends the whole time
kind of prove ease proving his not and
making his mission to find her and get
her home safe and it's so it's so good
guys you have to watch it there's gonna
be another season which I cannot wait
for also I went to the actual pub where
it was filmed accidentally I was near
Broadway Market on the weekend and my
friend pointed out that the palm tree
pub I think that's what it's called
it's from save me and I went in and it
looks exactly the same it was very
exciting so that I would really
recommend what's at first the other
program I want to recommend is ambulance
all right we did last week saying how I
am so obsessed with watching any
programs that are to do with the UK kind
of emergency systems emergency my words
just like not with me today
I'm obsessed the programmes about the
NHS basically I love one born every
minute
I love 999 what's your emergency and at
the moment I'm obsessed with ambulance I
mean it's it's a program where they
follow the ambulance service in West
Midlands which is like Birmingham area
for two 12-hour shifts and it's a bit
like a reality TV show where they kind
of show what happens during a shift of
an ambulance which already wants to be a
paramedic he would have made such a good
paramedic such a shame he didn't go into
that but it just amazes me what these
people do for a job and it's so
interesting to see the different things
that they discover so many like old
people that live at home alone and kind
of like fall down the stairs and it's
really heartbreaking but also just so
much like mental health it's crazy how
many of the 909 calls that's do with
mental health so it's really interesting
it's not kind of like gory and like if
you're like scared of blood and stuff I
don't really think you have to worry
it's more it's deeper than that so that
I would really recommend and then the
final TV show is little boy blue which I
actually hadn't heard of until I went to
the BAFTAs because they were nominated
for quite a few and I think they won
Best Actor or something like that
little boy blue is about the story of
the murder of Rhys Jones which I really
remember I don't remember how long ago
it was but I remember seeing on the news
an 11 year old boy got shot and it's
just a really well-made program about
that it's particularly poignant when
when the families are still alive so I
think they just wanted to share the
story and it was just a really good
program I definitely recommend watching
it very sad really heartbreaking but
very interesting as well so those are
all of my favorites I really hope you
enjoyed catching up on all the things
I've been loving this month you know how
people always say that they don't see
people's videos in their subscription
boxes and I just thought that was a
thing that doesn't really happen well
last week I noticed that I've missed out
on four videos from one of the channels
I really loved they 100 percent weren't
in my subscription box and when I went
to their channel they were there so it's
a thing if you're not seeing my videos
in your subscription box you can click
on the notification button which just
gives you a notification on your phone
when I upload which is only once a week
so it shouldn't annoy you too much or
just check my channel if you want and I
always put on Twitter and Instagram when
I have a new video as well so thank you
guys so much and I'll see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
