favorite video it's been a while since
I've sat down and done proper sit-down
video because as you guys know I've been
doing two vlogs a week this month and I
hope you guys have been enjoying them
thank you for watching and put your
comments as always before I start I'm
going to tell you what I'm wearing on my
lips and my eyes so I always get
questions and then I always forget by
the time it comes to editing so I've got
them here with me on my lips is Mac plum
full which is one of my favorite lustre
lipsticks from Mac and all my eyes is
the by Kerry Umbra black star in misty
rocked again one of my favorites and
this combination is one that I like to
wear a lot together also talking about
by Terry our third episode of our
podcast at home with went up this
morning and it is with Terry de Gunzburg
herself she is just a great great person
I really wish I was related to her I am
so lucky to have actually been to her
house once before so this is the second
time I visited her home and she's so
warm and welcoming and lovely and
analyzed and has the best time shopping
for her
we literally came out of recording that
podcast like skipping down the road it
was so so great so I'm going to put the
links down below for episode three of
our podcast at home with if you want to
go download it and have a listen let us
know what you think I'm really excited
to this one so I can't wait to hear kind
of the feedback from you guys right
let's get on with my main favorite and
I've got quite a few different
categories today I'm going to start with
beauty first thing is a mascara and this
is the deal deal show pump and volume
it's had quite lost coverage I've seen a
lot of people talking about it with the
scar as I tend to just try everything
that I'm spent at least one with the
mascara because I can tell straight
aways in there like or not and I really
like this one first of all I must say I
hate the packaging this is rubberized
and it's already like peeling and it's
really grumpy and messy I just hate web
attacks jinan makeup but the reason is
robbery so that you can pump the bottom
and apparently that so that you can get
more product onto the wand so if you
want kind of extra product on your
lashes that's how you do it I don't
really tend to use that although I find
it quite helpful for getting products
out and bottom of the tube anyway I
really like this mascara it's got a
pretty standard like plasticy wand and
but I think it's like Marmite vive
seeing people hate it a lot of
says that it runs on their eyes I don't
tend to get that problem I use the
Charlotte Tilbury legendry lashes a lot
and that's another one that a lot of
people with kind of greasy oily eyelids
say that it runs but that one doesn't
run on me so I think that's just a
problem that I don't really get so it
doesn't run on me I find that it gives
really really long lashes I'm wearing it
today
the length is amazing it gives a little
bit of volume it's not a crazy amount
but I just really like it I just think
it's a really easy mascara I would buy
it again but like I said I really hate
the packaging so I wish that it wasn't
rubber yeah really really good mascara
and I think it deserves all the hype
that's been getting by the way guys
please excuse my eyebrows I'm getting
them threaded tomorrow right next up in
the Beauty category is an eye cream and
I'm really settled with eye creams I
always forget to use them but I went to
the skincare consultation I told you
guys about it last month and she
recommended the event physio lift eye
cream and I really really liked it and I
think what I like an ice cream that
encourages me to actually use it every
night before I go to bed I don't use it
twice a day but I've used in the evening
it's a kind of balmy cream and I just
put it on my look my four fingers and I
pass it around my eyes it's not too
liquidy that it like goes everywhere
it's not too stiff that it ends up like
hiding my eye area it's just somewhere
in the middle it's perfect I don't know
where the lid has gone but I just got
this at Boots and it's great I also have
a few bits here from a brand called the
ordinary now I don't think I'm going to
actually talk to you guys about this in
this video because I think I might make
a whole separate video about it because
I just find it really interesting so let
me know if you guys are interested in
that it's really not that I won't but I
kind of wanted the video about this
brand so here I've got there retinoids
the hyaluronic acid and the glycolic
acid and I think I'm going to talk
through all the products that I have
from there in the step video and compare
them to other products with a higher
price tag that I have the car like a
dupes video because I'm really impressed
at the range basically spoiler is I love
it okay let's about life stuff and as I
was just talking about our podcast I'm
sure you guys know all about it by now
but I just wanted to quickly talk about
how much I'm enjoying doing it it's a
completely different process to anything
else I've ever done I'm so used to doing
videos
Twitter Instagram all the other things I
do and this is a brand new platform and
we're using completely different skills
you know we're not professional
interviewers with we're just kind of
winging it and taking your feedback and
just enjoying chatting to people but
something I found whilst doing the
podcast is it's really fulfilling it's
so nice to be able to get out the house
and create something that's really
rewarding like seen in the charts if
something has tangible and it's just
making me like happy a person I'm really
enjoying working on this project and I
know that other things and maybe I'm not
doing as well anymore but for me I've
just got to the point where I need to
focus on things that make me happy and
the podcast is really making me happy
and I love it and I can't wait to record
more it's so nice to spend more time
with Anna as always let us know if you
have any suggestions of other people
you'd like us to have on the podcast
yeah that is my update on that I'm also
talking about like platforms and loving
because obviously we as youtubers
bloggers do a lot of different things
online we have all the different
platforms that we need to kind of manage
and I think I go through phases of
loving some and not licensed arm and at
the moment I'm really really enjoying
Instagram it's been quite a while where
I've just been enjoying it and I find
myself doing Instagram stories instead
of videos or putting photos on Instagram
instead of on my blog and it's just like
a really good hub that I'm enjoying
uploading to so you don't yes I love me
on Instagram my username is at a pebble
I try to upload daily I'm doing way more
like fashion style posts on there at the
moment and I'm just really enjoying it
so I finished big little lies on TV and
my sister recommended what should
something called casual which you can
get on Amazon time I have Amazon Prime
anyway to delivery so we tend to watch a
lot of TV on there's some really good
shows on there and casual is so good we
basically binge watch the whole of
season 1 and season 2 and I really
really like yeah I feel like it's quite
different it's very funny it's based
around a bit of its functional family
it's a mom and her daughter she gets
divorced and moves in with her brother
so it's like an uncle daughter and mom
and they're all a bit messed up from
their upbringing and it's very much
about relationship and friendship and
it's so good I just really enjoyed it
so sad that it's over but I hope season
three starts soon so that was with my TV
recommendation of the month
definitely definitely watch it I think
it's such a good one okay for style
favorites this month I've just been
loving denim I've been adding some new
pieces of denim into my wardrobe the
first thing are these dungarees which
I've shared on my Instagram I never
thought I'd be able to find that Paragon
giri's actually suited me because when I
was younger I used to wear them really
baggy but that does look all for now but
I didn't realize that dungarees now I
kind of they fit differently there
they're kind of like skinny jeans but
just with a dungaree part at the top and
there's so much easier to wear this pair
that I have here are from hush and I've
really been enjoying stuff from crash
recently it's an online retailer and
they've just had such nice bit my
mommy's the oil shop at harsh and it was
such a mom brand either I just got older
or the brand's got a little bit younger
I don't know but I really like that
stuff I've got the dungarees in a size
10 and I'll put a little picture on
screen for you I really really liked
them really good for summer I also
bought em these jeans from Topshop
they're the three genes that's really
hard to say Adri
what a silly name for jeans they're kind
of high-waisted but not too high waisted
they've cropped and they have this frame
on the bottom I think they're a bit of a
Marmite product as well a lot of people
hate them I really like them I still
carry from wish wish wish wearing them
ages ago and I haven't stopped thinking
about them since
so it has to pick them up to myself and
I just I really like it add something a
little bit different I've got so many
like planes skinny jeans and then I also
got some jeans from Urban Outfitters now
I've been wanting mom jeans for so long
but I can never get them on I'm usually
like a 28 in jeans and whenever I try
lunges because there's so I wasted the
waist is quite small but if you have any
hit I look quite big hips I think I can
never ever get them past my hips and in
the change room it's always like
slightly depressing that I can't get my
jeans on but I finally found some an
Urban Outfitters because they do half
sizes so they do 29 so I basically went
up half a size so I could get them past
my hips but then they actually fit all
right on my waist because I actually
think I probably am 29 I just tend to
squeeze into a 28 and eventually the
jeans stretch but once I've got a DS and
then maybe and they're really really
soft with a crazy soft denim and they've
got a pinstripe and then I just roll
them upwards to the book
they feel like swearing like min and
Charles or something they're so
comfortable and I think mom dreams are
really flattering on your bottom as well
there are some which aren't but if you
find the right one they should flatter
you and then I also just got the plain
denim I was going to get the cropped
ripped ones but I thought I would get
the ones where I can roll up the bottoms
and if I get bored of rolling them off I
can always just cut off the bottoms I
know a lot of people that do that I'm
always terrified but my friend Deb's
reassures me that it's easy to do so yes
it's nice to have a different style of
jeans and I think mom jeans are really
good could they serve I wasted you can
wear slightly cropped tops without
actually showing your belly so those are
all my style favorites and finally the
last one which I just added to the list
I wasn't going to put it in first things
I have to do I have to be honest with
you guys and tell you things I've been
loving this month I never ever thought I
would add this into a favorites video
but I have been loving Harry Styles a
new album now I am NOT a One Direction
fan I was never a One Direction fan I
didn't like any of those thumbs it
wasn't for me
it was for a younger audience I'm like
choking over this section of video I was
never one direction fan not into it at
all wasn't even a Harry Styles fan when
he was in that one direction but when
there's a new album out and it's one of
interest I like to curb take a listen
and see what's going on so I've been
listening to his new album and I really
really like it my personal music taste
is very influenced by like American
music in 70s Eagles James Taylor Beach
Boys that kind of thing and I feel like
his album is very influenced by that era
there's a lot of Beatles influence in
there lots of Bowie influenced in there
especially his single maybe like a
little bit of Evil's in there as well
it's quite like 70s old what kind of
vibe to it and it's just so different so
I imagine him bringing out and he wrote
all the songs or a gif co-wrote all the
songs so I'm really impressed I think
it's a great album and if you think like
I'm not a Wonder at Shaolin not Harry so
far just give it a listen because you
might be surprised my favorite songs on
the album are meet me in the hallway -
goes sweet creature and ever since New
York I think they're great at posit
listening to it even rich is into it so
yeah Harry Styles
has won me over so those are all my
favorites from this month please don't
