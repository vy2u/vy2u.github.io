and very excited today because today I'm
going away for my birthday weekend I'm
taking ten friends to a house in Norfolk
I found this house on a website called
rural retreats and it looks so beautiful
and I felt like last year I was planning
on having a big party for my third year
I feel be really fun to do like fancy
dress dress as a cheap station because
it's not select creative things you can
do but then as the year went on I
realized I actually really don't like
having parties I feel like the pressure
is too much and I don't mean oh who are
in Vienna come and this time of year is
so busy anyway for everyone so in the
end I thought actually all I want to do
is go to a really nice house take some
friends like whoever wants to come
whoever is free and just chill and like
make good food drink good drink go for a
nice long walks play games just get
really like cozy and Christmassy so
that's what we're doing and I can't
bloody wait today's Thursday my birthday
is on Saturday I'm gonna be 30 can't
believe it I'm not gonna vlog the whole
weekend because I want to also just
relax and enjoy it but I'm gonna vlog
today and tomorrow who's coming SJ Robb
Jemma Ben and their baby Deb's and Paul
Hannah and Mike me and rich and then on
Sunday I'm meeting up with my family
like somewhere between Norfolk and
London for a lunch for my birthday so a
whole weekend of celebrations it's very
exciting that my birthday falls on a
Saturday I remember looking this up
years ago to be like when's my 30th
gonna be and be and be excited that it's
on a Saturday it's a good day for a
birthday so I'm just getting ready
richest downstairs watching TV he's very
happy because he never gets a day off
work and because we're leaving at lunch
time he's got the morning off so he's
just relaxing and watching TV because
that's quite rare for him I realized
recently I hadn't really noticed I feel
like every single youtuber that I watch
their boyfriend or husband like works
for themselves or has a job where
they're at home sometimes and sometimes
at work I feel like me and Anna are the
only ones who have husbands who have
kind of a normal office full time job so
no I was just thinking like but they
thought it was quite weird so I'm just
doing my makeup and then I'm gonna pack
taking quite big suitcase just because I
want to take all of the cozy things I
want to take tracksuit bottoms and
jumpers and onesie all the cozy clothes
so I'm gonna need lots of space okay I'm
about to seriously overpack I feel like
if this is a trip where I had to be
smart then I would take nothing with me
and like two outfits but because it's
like a lounge wear comfy trip I have so
many things I like and I like having
options so I'm taking like four or five
jumpers and lots of loungewear these are
the piles going on I mean ridiculous I'm
gonna take the big suitcase though like
who cares not checking in on a flight so
I can over pack these take wellies as
well we're gonna be doing lots of walks
