well today I'm actually gonna be doing a
style video and I'm gonna be talking
through my best purchases I was gonna do
a video about my most worn in 2017 but I
actually thought as a viewer I would
prefer to watch something a bit more
general about the best purchases because
these are kind of the things that I did
where most last year but some of the
things I bought years ago and they've
just continued to be absolute staples in
my wardrobe so it was quite easy to
write a list of all of my favorite
things in my wardrobe I've got clothes
I've got shoes and I've got one bag as
well so I try to keep the list as small
as possible I really hope you guys enjoy
this video and let me know if you like
this kind of style and I'm standing in
front of my wardrobe and I'm gonna pull
some things out and show you first one
will come as no surprise and it's my one
pick of my favorite bag my favorite ever
bag purchase by far well actually I have
a Chanel and that was an amazing
purchase but in terms of where this is
the one I wear the most I absolutely
love it it's the Gucci Soho disco bag
and if you're thinking about buying it I
would really really highly recommend it
it's not completely structured which has
its pros and it's cons I think it's nice
to have a bit of a softer bag but it
means that it doesn't keep its shape
completely but look it's still doing
really well they've had it for a while
now it's this beautiful textured leather
so it doesn't scratch sometimes I get
that foundation on it and it's really
easy to wipe off it's got a logo on it
but it's not like in gold so it's not
that obvious and it has this like tassel
um it's a crossbody bag I'm hopefully
gonna have loads of photos of me wearing
these items so I'm just gonna throw them
into the video if I have images of me
wearing these things I just love this
bag because it fits so much inside you
literally sorry there's just like
tampons hanging out there and receipts
and everything you can fit so much in
here I think my only thing about this
bag because I wish wish the lining
wasn't so light-colored because it does
get really grubby easily I really love
this bag and I have a few bags and I
always think I should wear some of my
other bags but I always go back to this
one because it's just such a perfect
everyday bag and it works in the evening
as well I love it I'm so happy I got it
I want it in red and I want it in nude
okay the next purchase is this jumper
I've worn this so much you guys have
seen it all over my Instagram
I wear it to death and that's because it
was quite expensive I don't tend to buy
a lot of designer clothes actually I
really rarely do I think this is like
one of the first ever designer items of
clothing that I've ever bought and it's
Bella Freud and I decided to invest in
it because I don't think there's
anything else like it there are some
kind of copies but I feel like they just
look like copies because it's such a
distinct style of Bella Freud so it's
this jumper it's a really nice thin oh
god I don't know what it's made for
maybe like a wool or something and it
has the nineteen seventy across it she's
got loads different styles but I really
like the nineteen seventy one and this
comes in loads of different colors I
think it's really recognizable as Bella
Freud I think it's really chic and
stylish it goes really well with jeans
but you can like dress up with like a
black leather skirt or something or
black leather trousers
I absolutely worn it to death I really
loved it and I'm so happy I bought it so
definitely an investment but one that I
don't regret making at all also by the
way this isn't usually hanging it's
usually folded in a jaw so my job as
they fold some of them I hand depending
on how I think it's gonna like damage
the jumper but I'm just hanging it for
the purpose of this video okay I'm gonna
continue with clothes and then I think
I'll do coats and shoes and other
accessories at the end the next item is
I actually had to pull this out of the
wash so excuse how creased is and a
little bit dirty but it's this t-shirt
from whistles it's the one that says
Janousek quoi and I just love these
t-shirts I really hope they're not
changing the style because I went in
recently to buy some more and they
didn't have any I love the fit of it
it's the perfect length sleeve it's the
perfect light weight it hangs really
nicely it tucks in really easily it's
not like one of those stiff t-shirts and
I obviously really like the slogan as
well but if these came in just plain
white I would buy like 20 of them my
favourite fit of t-shirt by far and yeah
I'm really happy I got this I wear it
seriously like every day it's why it
really needs a wash I'm just gonna like
throw it on the bed two more things
first of all jeans I've spoken about
these a lot they are the Urban
Outfitters axle B D G B D G axle jeans I
think I discovered these last year and I
really love them since then I have gone
on to discover the Topshop ones and and
Other Stories ones but although these do
stretch I still love these the most
because this
comfortable to wear and for me style is
always about comfort first always so I
have them in the light wash and the
medium wash and the black the black ones
come up slightly tighter actually but
they're just so comfortable they're
high-waisted a straight leg and then
they're cropped at the bottom and I
would highly recommend these jeans I
really do love that I feel like I've
spoken about them a lot but they were a
great find last year okay the last thing
from my wardrobe in here is this dress
which I bought in French Connection I
think I bought this the first time for
an event I can't for the life of me
remember what it was what the event was
but they then went on to wear it to
Anna's wedding I've worn it to here one
to two or three weddings I've worn it
multiple times because I love it so much
it's definitely I'm so not into like
wearing clothes once and then never
again I think if it's really nice and
you should wear it
especially if it was a bit pricey this
is actually just French connection so it
wasn't that expensive but I really love
it this is probably my favorite dress
that I own just because of the cut I
really love the print as well and
there's something really nice about
wearing a bit of red it feels really
special it's kind of high necked but
because it's a bit sheer there's like a
little slip that you wear underneath and
then it's got long sleeve which I think
it's really flattering and the skirt
part is kind of ruched it's got these
like different layers which is so
flattering if like me you've got kind of
a little bit hips
I feel like this little seam here
cinches in it the absolute perfect place
for me it's not if it's too low then
it's where I'm bigger but if it's higher
up that's where I'm smaller so I really
love the shape it's so flattering it
comes just above the knee I love this
dress so much I feel like I will
continue to wear it to as many events as
possible until it no longer fits me it
has a zip at the back little opening
there it's so nice I love it such a good
purchase okay so let's talk coats
because I have an obsession with buying
coats I guess for me it's because that's
the thing you see the most like you can
spend a just styling up an outfit but
then the weather is always rubbish here
so you end up throwing on a coat anyway
so if your coat looks good then your
outfit looks good so I do love buying a
coat and they always fit coats just
always look good the first one I want to
talk about you guys would have seen this
so
much in photos on Instagram and stuff
it's the checks one from Topshop if I
like this sold out so quickly when I
first got it it was really hard to link
to and I don't know if it's come back in
but I will link as many items as I can
down below and if they're no longer in
stock I will try my best to find an
alternative one for you guys to have a
look at I usually get my coats in a
twelve just because I like to layer them
over coats I think in like tops and
clothes I'm kind of a 10 now I'm always
somewhere in between at the moment I'm
kind of a 10 but coats always tend to go
for a 12 I really like this I love the
buttons I love the fit of it I love how
it's quite long I really like long coats
on me they work so much better than
shorter coats and it just makes an
outfit more interesting I love the print
yeah I'm just so happy I got this I wear
it all the time and I think it really
suits me the other coat that I love I'm
so happy I bought it I think I might got
this in 2015 you know I can't really no
not till in the 15 2016 Cobra you
remember but I'm sure I've had it for
over a year this is the aviator style
coat from Zara and this is the sort of
style that you could buy in like acne or
AllSaints and spend easily over three
hundred five hundred pounds on it and
that's fine if you like investing in
coats like that and this definitely
feels cheaper the material this part
isn't leather but I'm so glad I went for
the Zara version because this coat or
jacket whatever it is has really lasted
me it's so warm it looks like this sorry
you haunt me C but I'll put a photo and
if I have one it's got such a warm faux
fur lining and it is actually warm even
though it's like synthetic I just think
the style is really cool I like wearing
jeans and thrown over a jumper and a big
scarf and I just find myself wearing it
all the time especially on weekends this
has turned into being like my weekend
coat and I remember when this came out a
Zara everyone was going mad for it and
it sold out really quickly but I feel
like they kept bringing it back for a
while so if you've got hold of one of
these that then well done because I
think it's such a good investment it's
not even an investment because it's like
high street price but it looks great
accessory wise this is such a boring one
but I absolutely love it I feel like you
can invest in like cashmere scarves and
I've never really found the right one
acnes you some lovely ones but for me I
really like my scarfs
quite long and I feel like the expensive
scarves are always a little bit shorter
I also it's really important for me when
a scarf doesn't just like stop at the
end it has some sort of frame I feel
like it's it's better anyway I bought
this from Topshop probably two years ago
and it's still my favourite scarf it's
got all bubbly and weird but I love the
color it's not too light a great it's
like a charcoal grey so it goes on I'm
wearing black when I'm wearing blue when
I'm wearing grey it kind of goes with
everything and it's long enough that I
can I tend to kind of make it that long
and then I wrap it round again and it's
the perfect length you hardly see but it
falls down to my hips and I love it I
wear it every day it's the best scarf
and it was just a cheap Topshop purchase
so for me it's just about how long the
scarf is if it keeps me warm what the
ends are like I like this one because
it's got tassels I'm so happy I got the
scarf
simple things please me the other
accessory that you guys know I've been
obsessed with is my Topshop Baker boy
hat I never know if hats suit me like
sometimes they really don't I feel like
um like fedora hats or straw hats don't
really tend to suit me but I tried on a
Baker boy hat and I love it I feel like
it makes people look like they're like
an off-duty London model not me in
particular I feel like the look is very
Kate Moss in the 90s and I think it's
really cool and it's great when you're
having greasy hair days it's great when
it's like a little bit drizzly outside
but it's not the sort of weather that
you can wear like a woolly hat because
it's not that cold it's so handy having
a hat feel like this has changed my life
I've tried to get more like the faux
leather one I looked at and some other
colours but they don't really seem to
suit me or fit my head I have quite a
small head so I just had this one for
now but I think it's great I think it
really makes an outfit and it really
makes it a little bit trendier and a bit
more exciting I tend to wear jeans and
jumpers every day so if there's any like
little touches I can do to get my outfit
then I'm into it
okay well into shoes and I have three
pairs of shoes to talk through with you
the first oh yeah I'm finished on my
first and only pair of designer shoes
I've never invested in designer shoes
because I don't really wear heels so it
seems a shame to me to spend a lot of
money on shoes that I rarely wear and
I've never I don't know I think before I
never thought about design
shoes not being heels anyway everyone
went mad for the Gucci loafers and I
wasn't really that into them at first
like the the standard loafers shape just
doesn't really suit me in it it didn't
feel like very me and then I heard about
the slingback Gucci loafers let me just
hold one up it would be easier and these
were so up my street I really like them
because they're more comfortable I've
got like a really weird toe that sticks
up so for me to get this extra space at
the back for my foot to move around
makes them so much more comfortable
it's elasticated so they're really easy
to walk in they're really easy to put on
as well and I like these because you can
wear them in the evening or during the
day they're really versatile they're
just a simple black leather shoe with
this little gold buckle these are
slingback ones I really should have had
them resoled I don't find them that
slippery so I haven't had them resoled
I haven't noticed though the front is a
little bit scuffed on one of them which
is a shame I'm not really sure what I
can do about that but pop from that
they've worn really well when I first
first got them like the first time I
wore them I didn't find them that
comfortable but then immediately they
wore in and they're so comfortable I
think they're really small I don't have
any other like smart shoes like when I'm
wearing trousers or if I want to smarten
up jeans these are great so happy I got
them kind of tempted to invest in a
designer pair of like trainers because I
my trainers every day so it seems like a
good thing to invest in but I haven't
really found any I feel like Gucci and
Chanel that all really like over the top
Brandi so if you guys know of any more
expensive good quality trainers let me
know I'm interested I don't know or I
might just stick to like Mike's talking
about trainers I am so in love with my
fans these are the blue ones and I wear
the blue ones because I felt like
everyone had the black ones and it was a
little bit different although I do
really want the black ones now because I
wear these so often that it makes sense
to have more than one I do up the laces
just because I think it looks kind of
cool but it does look smarter I think if
you'd kind of tuck them in I also got
the black leather ones which I'm trying
to wear in they're so uncomfortable it's
unbelievable but these the ones I've
worn the most as you can see my very
inner 'into has started to come through
them literally I have the most annoying
toes in the world but they're so
comfortable even though they're flat
usually trainers like this I find on
that confi like the converse
but these really are and they go with
everything okay my final pair of shoes
are these chelsea boots from jigsaw i
bought these a couple years ago i think
and they're the best things i've ever
bought they are leather and really like
covered in mud I just loved the style
they've got a tiny bit of a heel they've
got this kind of Chelsea boot style here
and then they're not round but they're
not pointed they're like somewhere in
between and that for me is the perfect
toe I find pointy toes make my feet look
bigger and they look a bit witchy and
then a rounded toe makes me look like 10
years ago like when I was at uni so this
is the perfect mix for me I love the
kind of crinkle style on the leather
because they're not so like smooth and
polished that you have to worry about
them getting scuffed because they kind
of already look scuffed which means that
you can wear them during the day you can
wear them in the summer with denim
shorts you can kind of make them really
casual or you can smarten them up with
like black skinny jeans or a dress or
something like that they are great
they're probably the only flat boots
that I own and I really like them oh I
have one thing one minute
the final item are these sunglasses from
Ray Ban I found these in Stockholm when
I was with Anna and it's really funny
because I am known to have an obsession
with sunglasses and I buy them every
time I'm with Anna and I said to her you
know what now I bought these I don't
think I'll ever need to buy another pair
of sunglasses and she was like howling
with laughter like yeah right whatever
you say that every time
since then I've got rid of five pairs of
my sunglasses I think I only have like
three or four now and these are pretty
much the only ones I wear and I haven't
bought any sense and I haven't felt the
need to as well I always felt like I was
looking for the perfect pair of
sunglasses I kind of small face and it's
a bit wonky and sunglasses never suit me
and I loved this style but I only ever
found the small ones these are the 52
centimeter ones is it centimeters any of
you remember that video where I called
them 52 inch to the guy in the shop I
still don't know what it is millimeters
anyway these are the slightly bigger
size and they're so perfect I feel like
they really fit my face sorry for the
reflection but I just think these are
great and I really haven't felt the need
to buy any other sunglasses since so ha
Anna I told you proved you wrong
I love them they're such a good purchase
so happy I found them I might look into
now I'm finds it excuse to buy more but
if teeth came in other colors I would
buy those anyway that is everything for
my favorite best purchases
I really haven't come up with the title
for this video yet but let me know if
you enjoyed this and I really like
standing up and filming videos this is
like a revelation I feel so much more
free and me and like I can move around
and do a dance and I don't feel like I'm
just like static sitting on a chair so
this might become a thing let me know if
you like that and I will see you guys in
my next video thanks so much for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
