there were over a thousand comments and
I really think that like 95% of them
were really intellectual clever
well-thought-out questions I hope that
doesn't sound patronizing but thank you
so much because I feel like I've grown
out of the what's your favorite lipstick
questions obviously use iPad too so I'm
going to be answering all of your
questions all of the ones I think you
guys would want to hear the answers to
I obviously can't answer them all a lot
of them were the same I also took into
account the most liked questions and I
haven't avoided any tricky questions as
far as I'm aware it's quite scary to put
myself out there like this but I
personally think there's no point doing
a Q&amp;amp;A video if you're just going to pick
out fluffy questions that are really
easy to answer so somebody is a bit
difficult to answer and I hope I don't
get misunderstood so I'm going to give
it a go and I need to stop waffling
because there are so many questions I'm
going to have to split this video up
into two parts there was some personal
questions there were some work-related
questions I think I'll leave the kind of
work you should be one for the next
videos to come back to that today I'm
going to talk through some of the
personal questions
Hannah asked My partner and I have been
together for 14 years now and neither he
nor I have any interest in getting
married did you always want to get
married in the end or was there a
particular reason that changed your mind
so I think you're either into the idea
of marriage or you're not and if you're
not that completely fine there's no
problem with that but you don't have to
be married to get on with your life to
have kids or to move in together
anything like that I don't really know
why I wanted to get married I know that
sounds weird but I grew up in a family
with two married terrors it's something
I always kind of looked up to and wanted
and although I'm not a traditional
person in any other sense for me I
really wanted to be married before I had
kids and I don't know why it's not for
religious reasons or anything like that
I like the idea of the security and
personally I thought a lot of people
said nothing changes and you get married
I feel like me enriched a much more of a
team now you know we've committed to
each other we said we're going to be
together the rest of our lives and it
feels like a really like solid team and
I really like that idea comes before we
still having kids but my answer to you
would be if it doesn't go right you guys
and just don't get married it's kind of
simple as that really do what feels
right Rebecca asked it's really sad that
so much went wrong for you on your
honeymoon would you say that you
the kind of person who looked more at
the positive or the negative it's funny
because I also think not on a rude way
at all
Rebecca but you obviously chose to hear
more of the negative I think it just
depends on how you perceive things
really because I don't see lots of
things went wrong on my honeymoon I said
this before I'm a realist and I don't
really feel like there's any point in
being fluffy and saying everything's
great and Sun shines and lollipops so if
I'm going to talk I like to kind of say
something helpful so in the video I did
about my honeymoon I probably pointed
out like the things that we would do
differently just cuz I wanted it to be
helpful but overall we had a brilliant
time I do point out the negatives and
things but I think I also am a positive
person I think well actually one of the
other questions I've got here is what's
the biggest misconception that viewers
have of you and I think the biggest
misconception my viewers have of me is
that I'm a negative person because none
of my real life friends were describing
is that I'm just honest and real I think
some people think that's negative I know
people who are very negative and I don't
think I'm like that personally but it's
all to do with how you hear things as
well I'm not one to like sit back I'll
always speak up and have an opinion and
a lot of people can think that's me
being negative or complaining I don't
know I am a bit of a negative person but
I'm also a plug this person to Broza ask
do you ever feel lonely and if you do
how do you deal with it yeah I really do
I actually hate being on my own which is
probably why I've always kind of had
boyfriend's since I was about 15 I've
never really been single for a long
period of time which kind of comes up in
another question I put a lot of friends
and family around me so I've never
really felt lonely but now in this point
in time probably when I feel my most
lonely I'm not going to really go into
it but because of my job and because I
work alone you know when me and Anna
used to live near each other we'd always
see each other but now we live quite far
it is very lonely and that's something
I'm working on thinking about getting
someone to help work me just so I have
someone to kind of bounce ideas off and
talk to you because we've met one thing
I hate about my job is the loneliness
and it's something I'm feeling now
than ever so I don't have massive tips
for you now on how to like not feel
lonely but obviously surround yourself
with lovely people and don't be shy to
talk to your friends and family about it
if you are feeling lonely that's the
thing that's weird about loneliness it's
not always a physical loneliness I'm not
physically lonely at the moment I feel
quite mentally lonely because all my
ideas or my problems or my worries are
just in my head so when you have mental
loneliness it's probably a good idea to
share that with the people around you
the lost heroine asked what is your pet
peeve this is a bit of a boring one but
cyclists in London who don't wear
helmets I can't bear it and I don't
understand it and I find myself shouting
at them through my car window it just
doesn't make sense to me why you would
choose to go out on the roads in London
on a bicycle and not wear a helmet
because I've seen people die all it
takes is for you to be knocked off your
bike and you hit your head and you're
instantly dead so I don't understand
I've seen parents before with kids like
either on a bike behind them or on the
back of their bikes not wearing helmets
and it just it baffles me and I feel
like it's one of those things I talk
about more than I probably should
Ella asks I'm currently in my second
year of a levels and I'd like to know
how you cope with exam stress and the
whole you test process for applying to
uni how did he know you choose the right
University and was it worth going so for
those of you not in the UK UK is like a
point system you need certain math you
test points to get into your University
course I didn't deal with it well at all
in fact when my school started talking
to me about the whole new caste process
I just blocked out didn't listen I
didn't think I wanted to go to uni and
then when the time came and my career's
teacher said I really think you should
try for just one course it was like a
mad rush to try and figure out how to do
this whole you caste thing I wish I'd
listened earlier because there are lots
of ways you can build up your you test
points that aren't just relying on your
grades you know music grades and all
different things can add to your new
test point so I wish I'd listened
earlier I really didn't understand the
whole process and it made it very
stressful at the time but I did get to
uni and for me it was worth going you
know I met my husband at uni and I
started my blog
two very important things in my life
I think for me the main things I've got
out of uni were life related you
learning to live alone having that
experience cooking for yourself washing
for yourself meeting new people but
outside of your bubble so for that I
really do think it's worth there but
also it's a massive debt that you get
yourself in so it's very hard to balance
whether it's worth it or not I think if
you find your dream job then don't
bother but if you're not sure what you
want to do and you want some more time
to think about it then uni is a great
way to give you that extra time and kind
of just see more outside of your home
bubble early ask I'm getting engaged
soon how do you know and I'm in love
with your engagement ring can you give
us details about your ring and talk
about the process of finding the perfect
one so I haven't spoken much about my
ring because I think it's a bit like
vulgar
I don't really and also a bit like
unsafe so I'm not going to like show you
my ring close up and talk about my ring
specifically but I do have something
interesting to add to the conversation
so I want to tell you about the process
of how which chose my room because it's
very different to what a lot of other
people do so rich actually proposed to
me just with the diamond alone because
he was a short sort of ring I wanted and
I think he wanted me to be part of the
process of designing my own ring so he
actually went to a diamond dealer you
can go to obviously make sure it's a
proper one like Hatton Garden in London
and you can go straight to the dealer
which means you'll kind of sign it at
cost price because if you think about
the shops like Tiffany in Cartier they
mark those rings up like four or five
times so you save so much money and the
process is really interesting like rich
went in and met with them he kind of
talked about me and my taste and then
they sat down with him and explained how
diamonds work all the different cuts all
the different clarity you kind of pick
it depending on the size and how clear
it is like how cloudy or not or not
cloudy richer she's got me a vintage
diamond that's another option is all
these different options that you can get
so he spent a long time obviously talk
about your budget and things like that
and then he picked the diamond he
actually proposed to me just with the
diamond in a box and then we went back
to the same place and I decided on the
kind of crown I wanted and the ring
depending on how many claws you have you
can make the diamond look rounder or
more square I knew I wanted mine round
I have one two three four five six seven
eight claws online there's just so many
different things you can do and
obviously it's not cheap it's never
going to be cheap when you're buying
diamond ring but it's four or five times
cheaper than buying a final ring from a
shop so it's a massive saving and a
really nice like personal process as
well so I hope that was helpful to you
Amy our top three favorite wedding
moments I'm getting married this summer
I know you probably want me to say like
mushy things like when I still rich I
was walking down the aisle but honestly
my three top moments were right at the
end of the night and when my friend Zoey
put on take that never forget which was
my request as the final song and Mark
Allen mark-paul my friend Deb's
boyfriend Ryan my brother-in-law and
Mike my friend Hannah's boyfriend over
on stage and pretty much did like to
take that tribute my main thing to take
that never forget and it was so good I
was laughing so much and everyone looked
like they were having so much fun and it
was just such a good way to end the
night that was one hey dude when I'm at
the end of the ceremony we got everyone
to stand up and sing Hey Jude and as
they were kind of singing no no no no we
walked out and it was so good and so fun
and everyone that could be happy and
another highlight for me was when we did
an israeli dancing before dinner if you
don't know what that is you can google
it it's just so much fun and it was
great for the people who've never done
it Haley ours would you ever get a pet
are you enriched cat or dog people I'm
kind of both I've had dogs and cats both
growing up I think rich would say he's
more of a dog person there are things I
like and dislike about both cats and
dogs I don't know if we would I think
we've discussed it and I think we would
get a dog once our kids are a little bit
grown-up like not fully grown up but six
or seven or whatever because you both
have dogs growing up which I think means
that we would like adults but we're also
very aware of the responsibility like I
know some people who just get dogs and
they have no idea and it's a big deal
it's a big responsibility and I don't
think I'm going to want a dog and young
kids at the same time I know it's really
good to have dogs around kids and
they're little but my parents will
always have a dog so they'll with my
kids will always be surrounded by a dog
anyway I don't think I want to have my
own dog until my kids are a bit older
there's just too many things to look
after and they're really expensive
uncover the untold ask I'm getting
married this June and I really don't
want to turn into a bridezilla how did
you stay calm in the last month or two
months before the wedding
I don't really know like a lot of the
stuff was sorted and then I just changed
the realization I mean rich had an
argument quite early on in the process
like a really big argument and we said
from now on let's never argue about this
again because it's meant to be a happy
thing and if we're arguing about it that
just makes no sense so I just kept
reminding myself the whole time like
what I'm actually working towards like
it's a wedding it's meant to be a
celebration of love and it's a positive
thing and to not get upset or stressed
about it
just enjoy it so probably never going to
do it again hopefully I think I just
went with it and enjoyed the ride and
thought anything goes wrong it won't
matter on the day and I won't care and I
didn't care I don't really know how to
tell you to not be a bridezilla or lice
and say is that it's not fun for you or
anyone around you if you are so try and
remember that
Alice Wonderland asked what if your
ethnicity and ancestry I get this
question a lot
I am completely British both my parents
are British English born and most of
their parents are apart from my dad's
dad who was German and came over to
England in the war Second World War so
that's kind of grandparent level my
great-grandparents I think some of them
were Russian and polish yeah that kind
of it I'm pretty much British another
question by Ashley is we're you raised
in a religious household it depends what
you call a religious household I'm
Jewish and both my parents are and I am
very much a Jewish person and proud to
be but we were never religious but
always oh it's very hard to explain I
would say we are particularly religious
but there are lots of things we do do
which makes us a very Jewish family they
really know how to elaborate on that
moot movies ask I've always admired your
relationships with your friends how do
you maintain them do you find that the
friends you've had since childhood have
changed and how do you grow together
it's really hard actually and when I was
thinking about this question I wasn't
really sure what advice to give it is
hard to maintain friendships and now
I've got older a lot of my
moved away Jake travels the world and
opera singer Keisha lives in New York
and it's very hard to maintain them so
she's on someone that doesn't like talk
on the phone or FaceTime and I feel like
there's so much pressure when you're
doing that to like talk in the moment I
much prefer to see my friends though it
is hard long-distance friendships a very
hard to maintain and I'm working on that
my friends who I do get to see who lives
nearby I just like to see them often and
I think it's really important when
growing friendships to be really open
and honest with your friends if you're
just having like topline small chat then
you're never really going to get very
far I feel like the more open and honest
I am with my friends and talk to them
about problems and fears and worries and
the future
and update them on news you know don't
wait for your friends to ask you what
you're up to tells them what you're up
to and share I feel like the more open
and honest and sharing you are the truer
a relationship will be I'm very honest
with my friends that's pretty much
nothing I wouldn't tell them I think
that's really important also I really
like to include all my friends you know
as you start to have different
friendship groups that can get difficult
but why not try and combine their
trenches groups no not everyone's going
to get on but sometimes I think over
friends will really all know that
friends new boyfriends so let's all get
with dinner together and don't feel
jealous about your friends seeing each
other without yous gotta have this to me
all the time now it's a nice thing to
see that your friends are becoming
friends with each other how many times
that reset friends isn't that whole
section Erica asked how do you get on
the road to becoming an adult are you
moving out getting married
saving paying a pension and did you ever
feel the pressure to sort your life out
in your 20s I'm 23 and I'm already
feeling the pressure
23 yeah that's a tough age like for me I
just finished uni and I felt I think
then I felt the pressure to get on the
career ladder and that's what I wanted
to sort out first I think I started
feeling the pressure to be an adult at
around 26 25 26 yeah it's definitely
felt it especially in London it's very
hard to get on the property ladder and
I'm really lucky that my dad is very
helpful and gives a lot of advice when I
need it but yes becoming an adult like
you're kind of late twenties is such an
awkward time it doesn't stop I'm still
doing it now I'm constantly freaking out
about like the next step
what's coming up I think you just have
to remind ourselves everyone feels that
way I've always been very good at saving
like money-wise in my mind you know I've
got certain things I want in terms of
property making sure I've got money for
my kids future so I just try and remind
myself of what kind of life I think I
want to have and I try and save for that
I don't know why I'm good at saving I I
made look from you guys like I spend a
lot of money actually I hate spending
money so I'll always save first before I
splash don't be afraid to ask people for
advice you're not supposed to know
everything
no one knows everything so if you're not
sure how it works if you want to rent a
property or buy a property if you want
to save for pension or anything just get
advice because it is complicated Lucy
asked have you ever struggled with your
mental health I hadn't ever before and I
remember like three or four years ago
the topic of mental health and anxiety
really became more of a thing on the
internet mainly because Zoe and Tanya
started speaking up about their feelings
and honestly no offensive end they're
friends of mine I thought at the time
like for it's just becoming a bit of a
thing like is it bad that people are
talking about so much I know it's good
but also that making people feel like
they have anxiety when they don't and in
my mind I just never had anxiety so I
couldn't really understand what everyone
was talking about and I was a little bit
skeptical if I'm completely honest I'm
so lucky that growing up I never really
had any of those feelings but honestly
over the last year or two years I've
suddenly become this person who does
have these like you do
forgotten how to speak English who does
have these feelings and now I know how
hard it is to explain and rich doesn't
even truly understand either sometimes I
just go like that and he'll grow on
though what's wrong why I go now I can't
explain it a lot of people say that
older they get the fed of anxiety yet so
for me it's the other way around older I
get and the more responsibilities and
the more worries I seem to be getting
more anxious sometimes I'm absolutely
fine most time I'm fine sometimes it's
like I'm like good luck I'm riddled with
anxiety and sometimes I can't even
explain it and sometimes just because
I'm busy so I'm starting to understand
more now how it feels but I think it's
really
common and I think to my friends about
it a lot of them have it as well and the
best way for me to deal with it to
remind myself to really break down what
it is that I think I'm being anxious
about and then remind myself of how
lucky I am although that also plays into
it as well because sometimes I feel like
when I'm stressed with work I feel
guilty because I feel like I can't
complain because I'm lucky that I have
such a great job and then the guilt kind
of makes it even worse sometimes it's
just nice to feel like you can complain
without any guilt but that just sounds
ridiculous and I'm aware of that I also
got lots of questions on self confidence
discussions are so personal but I'm just
going to go with it the next question is
what would you say is your biggest
insecurity both physical and
non-physical and what your biggest
security is I think what she's saying is
would you like and dislike about your
look and then would you like and dislike
about your personality I feel like this
could be a whole video by itself but I'm
going to quickly run through what do I
like about my look okay and I quite like
my overall look is that a thing I don't
know I wrote down a list just in case I
forgot my eyes I quite like I quite like
my face shape I like my arms and my leg
especially my legs they've always been
like a thing I know I can rely on like
if all else fails wear a short skirt my
hands is that thing you're allowed to
like I don't know I liked my nose from
the front but not from the side which
can leave me on to the next things I
don't like about myself is my nose on
the side my hair I know it looks okay
sometimes but I hate that it controls my
life my teeth I've managed to sort them
out now but they have been a struggle my
whole life my moles I know I shouldn't
say that and I do always try to
encourage people not to hate their moles
and not to make fun of people that have
them but if I'm honest is one of my
biggest insecurities my tummy I've never
had a flat tummy it's always the areas I
try and cover up and my toes I hope you
put up an Instagram recently and
everyone made fun of my toes but being
as when I was in holiday but I've mine
fake toes like flick up and they whisper
holes in my shoes and it's so annoying I
think my grandpa had it as well and I'm
seriously considering going to see if I
can get my toes broken and reset what do
I like and dislike about my personality
I think I am a good friend I'm honest
and loyal I am hard working things I
don't like
hate light interrupt people I don't mean
to and I try so hard not to I think I
just get so excited and I want to join
him in and I want to say the next thing
that I interrupt people and it's so rude
I can be negative family thing you
should see our family what's that group
like whenever someone shares something
someone always points out like what's
wrong with it it's just a bad family
trait that we have I'm really bad at
making decisions that I always feel like
I need someone else to help me make a
decision and also leads on to the point
that I care too much what other people
think so are how do you feel about
turning 30 if you have any special plans
for your birthday I feel a bit weird
about turning 30 I'm not normally into
birthdays I probably will do something
up me and rich we're going to have a
joint party because our birthdays are
two weeks apart we're both 20 30 I'm
also thinking maybe I might just get
like a cottage in the countryside and
take my friends that would be really fun
I'm kind of excited 10:30 but also a bit
nervous about it I think I don't mind
that I'm kinda you know I'm I'm married
I'm on the right track I guess or what I
wanted I thought I'd be married with
kids at 28 but I'm not that far off I
think what makes me nervous about
getting older is that if I'm getting old
it means that everyone around me is also
getting older and I have such a fear of
my family dying I know that's just a bit
out there for this video but I just
don't want anyone skills mix Gresham
jazz not ask I'm one of the people that
never comments but my question is you
seem like a person with very strong
opinions actually it's one of the things
that made me subscribe thank you do you
feel like you are confident confidently
yourself confident on what you do on
YouTube confident in your opinions etc
if so have you always been that way no I
was very very shy as a teenager I think
the people around me have helped me be
confident my friend Hannah specifically
really helped me come out of my shell
when I was younger I think it's
different depending on what you're
talking about when I'm around my friends
and family I'm very confident if I was
doing like a panel or something I would
be confident but self-doubt is a thing
and anyone has it I would say I'm a
confident youtuber I'm always doubting
my content and comparing and I think
you're something a lot of people suffer
with but yeah I would say on a
self-confident person I think that's all
down to
who I surround myself with Eleanor asked
is it normal that I'm 21 years old and
I've never been with a guy because any
guy that I've met hasn't really
impressed me or I've never fell in love
I feel so weird
that I'm a virgin in my old age first of
all 21 years old is not old age at all
second of all all I'm going to say about
this is that your comment got 247 like I
see pretty sure there's a top comments
quite a while so I feel like that's your
answer you're definitely not alone okay
a few more questions to end this section
these ones are a bit more like spiritual
s Berry asked what do you think happens
after death do you believe in things
like that I wish that it was like the
end scene in Titanic where a rose meets
Jack on the stairs in the ship but
honestly I don't think I do believe in
life after death I think you just die
horrible to think about really I've
never really thought about it but I try
to live my life to the fullest because I
very much believe that you get one life
and one chance I'm going to get that
tattoo I don't care if I regret it
because you only have one life it's so
short really even if you live for the
whole time it's so short and I don't I
don't believe you come back as an animal
or I don't think I believe in heaven
like I would like to and sometimes I'll
think like if something weird happens
I'm like well maybe that was my
grandparents visiting me but I really
think if I had to sit down and think
about it I don't think I believe in it
which is a bit sad really
Dominika are do you consider yourself to
be a feminist and what's your opinion on
feminism kind of don't have enough time
to go deep into this I recently did a
blog post about the color pink Connor
what it was called and it kind of gives
you a little bit of an insight into my
experience with feminism but yeah I
totally call myself a feminist and I've
never really had to think about why and
what defines me as a feminist it's
become such a hot topic recently online
which i think is incredible I've always
put myself a feminist but I've never
really been asked why or what makes you
a feminist and it's hard to vocalize
that because there's lots of different
things in my upbringing and in my
thoughts now that make me a feminist I
know I I know I believe in gender
equality I also think it's important to
mention
feminists are as you might envisage a
feminist all of my girlfriend's would
call themselves feminists and the topics
we discuss and the things that we care
about make a feminine but definitely go
check out that blog post or link it
below grace asked do you believe in
soulmates or the one if there when did
you know rich was it I had so many
questions about how I knew rich was the
one which I just didn't expect that
question because truly you just know I
don't know how you know when someone is
the one you just know that you want to
spend the rest of your life with them
and you can imagine them being the
father to your kids and making a home
with them do I believe that there is
just one no I think when you find
someone you know that they're the one so
if you feel like how am I ever going to
find the one I really don't think there
is one person in the whole world that's
right for you I think there are lots of
people you're very lucky if you find
someone that you want to spend all of
your time with okay I'm going to end
this video here and then I'm going to
carry on filming the next section which
offer up another time which is
work-related staff lots of like
controversial YouTube questions and then
a few like future and silly questions as
well so I really hope you guys enjoy
hearing this part the Q&amp;amp;A I hope I
didn't say anything to offend anyone but
I probably did if I said anything that
sounded wrong I probably didn't mean to
say it in that way without a disclaimer
or I can just say sorry now to everyone
who I've offended

in the next video either going to be in
QA or that will be the one afterwards
