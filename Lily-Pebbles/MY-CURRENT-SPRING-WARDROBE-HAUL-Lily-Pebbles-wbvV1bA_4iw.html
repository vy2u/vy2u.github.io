three times and it's not coming
naturally to me so I'm just going to go
for it without saying hi today's video
is going to be a style video I'm really
enjoying making this kind of content at
the moment it's going to be a video
about how I'm trying to experiment more
with color I'm trying to incorporate
color into my wardrobe and mix it in
with the kind of black gray and white
pieces I already have I don't have
anything against a kind of monochrome
wardrobe and in the autumn winter that's
actually something I really like but I
do find that when I wear color it makes
me feel a bit better and I also think it
makes me come across as a bit more of a
happy positive person I think if you
find the right color to wear it can make
such a difference to your wardrobe but
it's quite difficult to do that so I've
been on this like mini color journey and
I thought I would share with you guys
how I've done it and how I'm still
trying to kind of wear more color I've
been really inspired recently to add
images into my videos instead of kind of
moving cutaways I always think you
should give credit where credit is due
and I'm definitely inspired by Lily
Melrose videos at the moment I think
now's great so I'm going to link her
channel down below go and check it out
so I think like a lot of people I found
myself getting into rough with my
wardrobe wearing jeans and a gray jumper
kind of most days and just not loving
outfits that I was wearing I've got a
kick of inspiration when I went shopping
with my friend Deb if you guys for the
video on and since then I've just felt
more inspired to try new things but not
try crazy things that I'm going to
regret purchasing making kind of more
sensible decisions and buy things that I
know I'm going to like so how I started
this whole like color journey and the
first step is getting some inspiration
and you can get inspiration from all
kinds of places magazines online
sometimes they go into Pinterest and our
search summer style or you can search
all different types of keywords to bring
up loads of different people wearing
loads of different outfit and I feel
like that's a good place to get some
inspiration also obviously looking at
blogs and watching YouTube videos I hit
the main place for me where I find my
style inspiration is on Instagram and I
have found it so so helpful recently
saving images on my Instagram and using
that kind of little Instagram mood board
as a starting place when I'm going
shopping or looking for new clothes if
you're saving images on Instagram and
they're clicking the ones that appeal to
you when they all come together it's
quite easy to see the sort of style that
you would like to have and items that
you'd like to purchase so just to let
you know if you want to save photos from
Instagram on the bottom right hand
corner of the photo there's this little
icon and if you click that it
automatically saves it so here on my
profile if I click on this icon this is
where all my saved images are and it
works like a mood board of inspiration I
use this when I was shopping and it was
so so helpful you can also see like an
overview of the sorts of colors and
styles that you're naturally attracted
to there are a few people on here that I
really love to follow on Instagram this
is my friend - Jean this is Carrie from
wish wish wish this is Reims Instagram
I'm going to link all of these below
this one is sincerely Jules and then
we've got Liz from what Olivia did Amy
from the little magpie so many other
people lots of new people actually I'm
going to put in the description box
below some of my kind of new favorite
Instagram accounts to follow because
I've got so much inspiration from these
ladies and clearly I'm attracted to like
the bright oranges the blush pinks and
denims and blues I love this image as
like summer inspiration so again I'll
link all of those Instagram profiles in
the description box below so many
stylish ladies who just give me daily
inspiration for outfits that I want to
wear and I think that's been a key part
of this process so my second tip would
be to pick your color palette and it's
kind of hard to do and I don't think you
have to be strict with yourself you'd
ask like stick to three colors but for
me it was quite obvious that those three
colors I was naturally drawn to when I
was looking to my little Instagram saved
images and the sort of things are
picking up in shop there were three
colors that clearly stood out to me I
think it's also really important to try
things on or just hold back to your face
because you can kind of quickly see what
suits you and what doesn't green I find
quite hard to wear because I've got
quite sallow skin so it makes me look a
bit kind of yellowy but then I think
it's always good to try them on because
I used to hate red I used to think that
red made my eyebrows that pushing
everything look kind of hairier and my
face look paler but now I actually quite
like red so it's good to just keep
trying things out so lots of black white
and grey which I love is you have
my wardrobe I think the three colors
that I'm really drawn to at the moment
are blush pink blue and a kind of Orange
II red and I have so many new items in
those colors I'm loving wearing I'm sure
you guys have noticed especially the
pink I'm a bit obsessed with pink at the
moment and so now when I'm shopping I
know if I see something that color it's
probably going to suit me so that's my
color palette that I've picked out and
I'm so so happy with it as I said I'm
not kind of cutting out every other
color I'm still going to try things on
but those are the three main colors that
I know I like to have in my wardrobe so
ways to incorporate color into your
wardrobe first of all don't write off
denim I feel like people never count
denim as a color but it's blue it's
totally your color if you're used to
throwing black jeans and a black jumper
all the time then of course a nice blue
denim will brighten up your outfit and
add some color denim jeans denim jacket
denim skirt denim pinafore dungarees
it's definitely kind of an easy entry
way to start wearing more color I also
think with jeans colored socks can look
really cool and it's just a nice easy
way to add a little peek of color into
your outfit I picked up these ones from
and other stories which are like a pink
and white gingham I haven't worn these
yet but they look so cute I think these
would look really nice as trainers and
rolled up jeans and then this is a
3-pack from H&amp;amp;M that's pretty cheap I've
actually worn this light pink pair
already and they're just all different
shades of pink there I think
incorporating some patterns into a
wardrobe it's also a good starting point
if you're a bit nervous about wearing
like a block color I absolutely love the
silk shirts from Lilian line or they're
such good quality and have such pretty
prints I've got this one which is like a
black and grey which I know it doesn't
really count as the color then it also
has a leather print one that's got some
blue in it and that's a really nice way
of working a bit of blue into your
outfit the most recent shirt I have from
Lily and Lionel is this leopard print
one which is the brown and beige leather
prints quite bold for me but it's a
really nice way to just make your outfit
a little bit more interesting and I just
tuck this into a leather skirt and more
of boots and it's so smart for an
evening outfit it's a kind of pajama
style shirt and I absolutely love it so
if you're not quite ready for a bright
color I think this is a good way to ease
your way in and it
he makes an outfit way more interesting
than just wearing a white shirt for
example because of the fabric these are
made from they sit really nicely I
really really like the shirt and then
you guys know my Topshop shirt which
I've shown in a previous video just
another patterned shirt got quite a lot
of color going on but the base color is
a navy blue so if that color was like a
bright pink of the waist area but
because it's color on a neutral
background it's much easier to wear you
can also use accessories as like an
entryway for wearing more color colored
bags a really easy way if you're wearing
quite a plain outfit like black white or
grey you can have an orange bag to add a
pop of color to outfit and I really love
that I think we've designed a bag it's
quite scary to invest in a bright color
I'm always leaning more towards the
blacks and the neutrals because I want
it to be a bag I love forever but there
are so many good eyes on the high street
as well and I'm going to link those
below for you to check out sunglasses
are also a good way to add some color to
your outfit and get those mirrored
sunglasses where the mirrored is colored
so that pink or blue and I think Natick
so cool so those are a few easy ways to
incorporate color into a wardrobe
and now I'm going to show you guys some
of the bits that I picked up recently
and I've also styled them into outfits
and taken photos so I can add them into
this video and show you guys how exactly
I would wear them I loved everything I
bought but there is one item that I'm
not sure about so I'm going to start
with that one because I really need your
guy's opinion if I for workout has to do
a poll on YouTube I might put a poll so
you can vote whether I keep it or take
it back if I can't figure that out then
just leave me a comment this is a pink
blazer from Topshop and I can't decide
whether to keep it or not
I'm kind of terrified of Blazers and I
always have been because I really like
the idea of them but then when I wear it
I just feel a bit weird I feel a bit
smart I love the colour of this it's
like a light pink slightly salmony pink
and it's like a soft material as well
it's got these big black buttons and
pockets and it comes to just below my
thumb and I'll show you how I styled up
with jeans and I like how it looks in
the photos I'm just worried that I won't
get enough wear out of it I've seen
quite a lot of people with this and it
comes with matching trousers as well if
you really want to be brave this is
probably the only thing I've bought that
I'm not sure so please let me know but
is a very pretty piece so I told you
guys I'm really into orange you read as
I said I used to hate red but I'm kind
of getting back into it this shirts from
Topshop and everyone has this I didn't
realize I picked up in Topshop and just
tried it on and I had no idea that it
like being on top shop Instagram it was
so popular I think it also comes in
black and white it's just so pretty it's
got this nice like floaty neckline and
then it does up in the front and I would
say that it's quite open so if you don't
like having a stomach out like me can
wear a little vest top underneath and
then it's got these really pretty floaty
arms and I just love the shape of it
when I wear it I feel happy I look happy
it's so pretty and I really like red
with denim I think red does go is black
but it's quite a contrast and I think
red looks really nice with blue denim
jeans so that's how I've styled this
with ripped jeans and I absolutely love
it it's currently sold out on top shop
but it's been so popular that I can't
see why they wouldn't bring it back so
keep an eye on the link I think it's
quite easy when trying to wear more
colors to just buy lots of colors top
and forget about your bottom half this
is also from Topshop and it's an orange
skirt it's in this really nice textured
fabric and it's got a scalloped edge on
both sides I really like the shape of
this skirt I don't know what they're
called but they're just kind of straight
they don't go out too much I think with
this one I'm wearing this gray t-shirt
which is from and other stories which is
amazing it's so nice and I waited and I
really like where I'm skirts you know
when the weather's right around you've
shaved your legs I think gets to be
really flattering and it's so fun to
have a bright colored skirt so I really
really love this you guys might have
seen this shirt on my Instagram a few
weeks ago I was definitely still count
mrs. color this is a really pretty light
blush pink house it looks like a linen
shirt but it's just cotton it's so soft
and light perfect for the summer it's
got buttons all the way down it's got
slight curves back wing on and it's
slightly shorter on their arms as well
it's a funny shape but if you tuck it
into your jeans the thing that looks
really nice
I like to wear this in a really casual
way just tucked into jeans with trainers
I think I saw this about Chloe bag which
they slightly clash in colors but I
don't really mind because it's just that
kind of light blush pink
muted
look it hasn't got a structured collar
which is what puts me off a lot of
shirts it's just really relaxed fit and
it's very very pretty and it's very
comfy which is important to me okay
what's next
this t-shirt is from Urban Outfitters
and I feel like graphic tees are quite a
young thing to wear but sometimes I
don't always want to look so put
together on the weekend I just want to
wear a t-shirt and jeans because it's so
comfortable t-shirt jeans and trainers
but I just really liked this t-shirt I
was drawn to the color I love a bright
turquoise blue it's got this little kind
of thing on the front that says rise
away of
California which is a bit cheesy also
has it on the back but I just think it
looks really cool it's a very easy
weekend t-shirt like I said I like to
wear as jeans maybe tucked into jeans
with trainers and the color makes me
happy it's so easy to get like graphic
tees in different colors okay the next
piece is from Reese and I actually had a
voucher for Reese like I said I don't
really like spend that much money on my
clothes and it's like really special I
had a voucher I probably wouldn't spend
this much if I didn't have a voucher but
I'm also really happy I got this because
I love it and I think I'm going to wear
it low we went into Reese to look for
some stuff rich and although it bored so
I was wandering around the men's
department try find him some jumpers and
I came across this in the men's
department
it's a pink former and it's just great
I'd asuras oh what a lovely color I love
this like sassy Rose blush pink color so
I picked up a small and tried it on and
it's a little bit big but in a cool
oversized bomber way I really really
love it there is no harm in shopping in
the men's department if you're not a man
and so glad I did because I really love
this bomber it reminds me of something
from that Greek it's kind of the same
color as my nails I'm really happy that
I got that the final thing actually only
arrived yesterday and after telling you
both that I don't normally buy designer
clothes this is actually probably my
first proper designer piece of clothing
but I've had my eye on it for so long
and I tried to find alternative and it
doesn't seem to be anything else like
here like normally in Joneses are a
Topshop and find a jeep but this is just
one of those things that you either have
the real version or you don't and I was
pretty daring and wet real bright color
they do this in black and gray and I
could have played it safe but it just
seemed silly too
I kept my friends s asking and she was I
definitely get the red this is a jumper
from Bella Freud's she does so many
amazing jumpers I'd like lusted over
them four years but never like wanted to
invest before in a really nice thin wool
which I like in a jumper like this
because it means you can tuck it into
things if it's too thick you have to
just kind of wear as a jumper and I
think the whole point of this one is
that it would look nice tucked into a
skirt options of jeans
it can be worn casual or dressed up
which is another thing I like because
it's red and it's got this 1970s trip
across the front of quite a statement
piece a lot of people kind of know what
it is they know it's a fella for a
jumper and I've seen it all over
Instagram I know like everyone has it
but I don't really care about that
because I really love it I think I look
nice with blue jeans on a casual day and
tops into my black leather skirt for a
more evening look I've also seen this
worn with a long kind of camel trench
coat and I think that looks really nice
well I've been looking for a camel
trench coat for ages but I've never
really found the perfect one it's still
on my list yeah this is my first kind of
Bella forage jumper and I'm really happy
with it
so those are all the new pieces that
I've bought to add into my wardrobe and
a lot of you guys have noticed how I'm
wearing more color and you're loving it
I'm loving it it's great let's hope it
lasts but I'm also going to do is I
think I'm going to create three pages on
my blog and I'm going to link to them in
the description box I'm basically going
to create three little mini shots for
you guys while I'm at full of red slash
orangie items that I love I won't kind
of own them all obviously I wish I could
it's just going to be things that I've
seen online and that I really like and
that I recommend to you guys too one for
the red-orange lovers one for the blush
pink and one for the blues so there's a
kind of three little edits that you can
shock form if you want to have a little
browse so we will link those below
I think it'll be nice to share with you

loved just check the description box
