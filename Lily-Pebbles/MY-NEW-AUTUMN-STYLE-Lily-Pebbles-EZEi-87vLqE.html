today's video is gonna be an autumn
transitional makeup hair and style video
the temperatures definitely dropped in
the UK and I'm not sad about it because
I really love autumn especially in
London so this video is in collaboration
with Revlon you guys know I've been
working way throughout the year and I'm
gonna be using their mega multiplier
mascara which is this one with the blue
lid I'm gonna show you how to use this
to create an autumnal eye makeup look
and then I'm going to show you how I do
my hair and then I'm gonna show you my
current favorite autumnal outfit so
let's start with the eye makeup and you
guys know I don't really like to change
up my makeup that much but in the autumn
I'm very much up for a more kind of warm
toned Brown look and sometimes I add a
little bit of car key green in there I
think green is such an amazing shade for
autumn so I'm gonna bring you in a
little closer and start the eye look
so I've done my face makeup I'm just
gonna do my eyes and my lips in this
video and I'm gonna start by using the
Revlon Colorstay cream eyeshadow these
are really great they come in a little
pot they also come with a little brush
if you want to use it but I'm just gonna
use my fingers because I think the cream
eyeshadow it's really easy to just use
your fingers to Pat it on the lids this
is the color 720 which is a really
lovely matte brown so I'm gonna put a
little bit of that onto my finger you
can see how pigmented it is and then I'm
just gonna use my finger to Pat that on
and I'm I'm using this is a kind of base
shade I think when you're doing a
slightly stronger eye it's nice to start
with a good like solid brown base it
applies really nicely with the finger
and you can use like one of your clean
fingers just to blend out the edges I'm
just gonna keep building up until I'm
happy with the amount of shadow I've got
on there I'm gonna do the same thing on
the other side just patting it on and
then using a clean finger to blend it
out I think this is also a really nice
shade to wear by itself if you'd like to
I'm gonna make try and make this look a
little bit heavier I'm also going to
take a tiny bit of that under the eye
again just using my finger I don't want
this to be a really neat eye makeup look
so that's the cream eye shadow based on
and I'm gonna go in with a powder
eyeshadow from the Revlon Colorstay not
just nudes eyes shadow palette this
comes with ten really pretty brown
shades
summer mattes in summer shimmery I think
I'm going to use this really nice warm
kind of golden bronze eyeshadow I think
that will really warm up the look and
add a really kind of like autumnal
leaves kind of look to the eye I'm gonna
give this little brush ago actually I
haven't tried this one before this is
such a gorgeous eyeshadow color I
actually quite like this brush because
it makes you not over apply the shadow
you can be quite precise about it it's
got such a pretty golden tone to it I'm
gonna do the same on the other eye the
cream shadow underneath is quite a cool
tone and this is definitely a warm tone
so it kind of meets somewhere in the
middle it's so pretty I'm gonna use the
other end for the brush which is a
little bit smaller and actually I'm
gonna take this matte Brown here and I'm
gonna take that underneath the eye don't
be afraid to go quite low because I
think that's what makes an eye look look
quite grungy and I really like that I
think that looks really really pretty
and now what I'm gonna do which is
something I used to do I remember
watching a Tanya burr Rihanna inspired
makeup tutorial on YouTube and it really
really got me into green eyeliner and
actually green works really well
especially if you have brown eyes it's a
really nice way to add color to your eye
makeup look that somehow doesn't feel
too scary so I've got this green
eyeliner from Revlon which is the
Colorstay eyeliner in 206 Jade it's gone
eyeliner on one side which is really
soft and creamy and then on the other
end it's got a sharpener and it's got a
little kind of sponge that you can buff
it out which is actually gonna come in
really handy because I really want this
eyeliner to be really blended out so I'm
taking this green eyeliner and I'm gonna
run it along the top of my lash line
it's really pretty green but it's not
like a bright green so it works really
well with the Browns because it's kind
of like the car pea I like to pull my
eyeliner out quite a bit just so it
doesn't mean my eyes look small and then
what I'm going to do is I'm also gonna
take it under the eye and I'm gonna take
it in the waterline which isn't usually
something I do but I think with this it
will look really cool
going in with quite a lot of eyeliner
and then what I'm gonna do is take the
other end with
little sponge on it and I'm gonna just
buff out really soften the edges I'm
gonna take that little brush that I used
with the eyeshadow because it probably
has a bit of eyeshadow left on it and
I'm gonna buff it out even further I
think if you mix a little bit of brown
eyeshadow in just softens the eyeliner
you want it to kind of merge with the
eyeshadow and not feel too separate so
when I'm blending it I'm also kind of
pulling it up I hope you can see it's
kind of not too harsh of a line I'm
gonna go do the other eye and then I can
kind of come back and perfect it at the
end taking that green eyeliner all the
way across I'm gonna so that is the eye
shadow and the eyeliner done I really
like it it's really nice kind of bronzy
brown and then the green just has
something a little bit more grungy and
different so now I'm gonna go in with
the mega multiplier mascara this mascara
uses a new technology that combines both
fibers and tubing you may have heard of
mascara tubing before basically the
fiber coats and plumps the lashes so
that's where you get the mega volume
from and then the 360 tubing like locks
in the lengthening so that's where you
get the mega lengthening from so this
mascara aims to give you both volume and
length which sounds amazing to me I'm
gonna apply some now as you can see it's
got a pointed tip I also find this
mascara it doesn't smudge throughout the
day you don't kind of find it falling
onto your cheeks but it actually removes
really easily which is the best of both
worlds really I'm gonna like wiggle it
up from the roots and as you can see it
gives amazing volume and length to my
lashes find that pointed tip is really
handy when you're getting the lashes on
the edge anyone else find do mascara
incredibly relaxing so that is the
mascara done and I think it really pulls
the whole eye look together I'm really
into it actually I always forget how
much I love green eyeliner until I come
back to it just to finish up the eye
look I'm gonna use the Revlon Colorstay
brow pencil this is actually the one in
blonde I also have the one in soft brown
maybe I should use the one a soft brown
actually I love it when brow pencils
have a spoolie
one end so I'm just gonna brush my brows
through this is actually a really good
like firm spoolie and then using the
angled pencil I'm just gonna fill in the
Front's of my brows and the arches
because this is a transitional autumn
look I thought I'd be a little bit more
daring with my lip and I'm gonna use the
revlon matte balm this is in the shade
270 flamboyant this is one of their
matte crayons and I'm not gonna put it
on really heavy let me just make sure my
lips are dry I'm gonna draw it on I
always forget how amazing these smell
they're like minty very lightly and then
using my finger I'm gonna Pat it in this
gives a really nice like blotted lip
look that you don't have to like reapply
all the time it's almost like a lip
stain it's a bit different to my usual
nude look but it's also not too intense
it's just like a little bit of a lip
stain so that is my autumn eye makeup
look and now I'm gonna show you how I'm
gonna do my hair for the rest of the day
so now I'm going to show you how I like
to do my hair and it's nothing really
different from usual this is my hair
when it's straight and I just think it
looks a bit plain and flat so I like to
put in a few waves I'm not very
particular about it because I kind of
like it when they fall out and it just
looks like you have effortless waves so
you don't have to be a professional to
get this look I've got my straightness
here and these are the ghd's in this
size and I've got grips so I do my hair
in kind of three actually I kind of do
it in two parts because like I said if I
miss a few sections it's really not the
end of the world
so I clip up this top section I'm going
to try and do this by looking in the
camera so I take a section that's like
about that much hair and from about
halfway down I clamp it and then I twist
it away from my face and as I'm twisting
it I'm pulling straighteners down Anna
showed me how to do this years ago and
it's just the way I've been doing my
hair ever since so again that much hair
half way down twist it away from the
face and as you're twisting it you're
pulling it down keep twisting it keep
twisting it and then you get like that
kind of curl so it's not perfect
but I don't want it to be perfect so but
you have to do this while looking in the
camera and then again always away from
the face you can actually do it
mix-match some away in some towards just
for me I've tried it and it looks better
on my hair when I do it away and it
doesn't look too uniform because like I
said some drop out on some day sometimes
actually I just take a bit of the top
layer I'll keep that to the very end
okay I'm gonna go do my hair in a mirror
and come back to you okay this final
section this is the bit that really gets
seen so I like to do this bit properly
do my little front bits okay so that
should be it and then go through and I
kind of rough it up with my hands and
then that's how I get a few waves in my
hair okay so now I'm going to show you
my current favorite autumnal outfit and
like I said I'm so excited to be heading
into autumn and my clothes can get a bit
more like cozier and I just think autumn
fashion is great this is a new jumper
that I picked up on ASOS it's by a brown
weekday I'd be speaking about weekday a
lot recently I think it's cuz I went to
Stockholm and a wit dis stores just
opened at London this is a cashmere
blend jumper I love cashmere like when
it gets colder it's just the most cozy
comfy soft material I hate itchy
materials so cashmere is great this is a
cashmere blend but it's so so soft is
this really pretty mint green
it's got mint and like a peach running
through it I don't know if that picks up
on camera but it's not like completely
mint color very soft it's got this kind
of drop hem on the shoulders which makes
it look like a very relaxed feel this
looks really nice tucked into jeans and
I like rolled up the sleeves but
actually I'm gonna try this tucked into
a skirt this is a new skirt that I've
just picked up from Reese I had a
voucher to spend and I got very excited
suede is a very autumn material and this
brown color is a very awesome color as
well so is this high-waisted miniskirt
it's got these pockets and it's got a
button it's very 70s feel very 70s vibes
and I kind of love that about it it's a
really good solid material it feels
really comfortable on so I'm going to
try talking the sweater into the skirt
and I think the colors go really well
together
you
normally put mint with a brown but I
think is just I mean those colors just
scream autumn to me so I'm gonna try
pairing those together and then to go
with the skirt I got these out from
underneath my bed from last year I
bought these pretty sure I bought them
towards the end of winter last year so I
didn't get much wear out of them but I
definitely knew I would this year then
over the knee boots did I get these my
office or Aldo I can't remember the knee
and they tie up at the back they don't
slip down that much in there this is
really pretty black suede I think over
the knee boots are really good for
transitional times because they keep
your leg covered up so you're not too
cold you don't have let your whole legs
out you just got a little bit of skin
between the boots and the skirt so I
think these will look really cool
hopefully and then I'm gonna wear of
course my black Gucci Soho disco bag
because I didn't wear any other bag at
the moment I just love this so much and
it looks really good on the shoulder or
crossbody and fits everything I need in
it so I actually really like how this
outfit looks I think the color of the
sweater really adds I can autumn feel
and I love the softness of it how
slouchy is I've just rolled up the
sleeves so the top looks really casual
and then paired with the skirt which is
a bit smaller so I think it's really
nice this whole outfits really
comfortable the skirts really can't
because it's high-waisted and it's
obviously really soft because it's suede
and then the boots are really soft
because they're suede as well and then
I'm just wearing my plain black bag
which is a nice kind of simple accessory
to go with a bit of an interesting
outfit I think it looks really nice and
autumnal and I feel really happy in it
so I really hope you guys enjoyed this
