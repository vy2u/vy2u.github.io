thought I would vlog it's pretty much
just a workday but I think I'm going to
vlog today in a bit as the weekend as
well as to make it a little bit longer
whoo this is the first time surfing
today which is why my voice sounds weird
I'm actually trying out workspace today
it's a second day I'm giving a go in on
Wednesday I'm sharing it with Carrie
from wish wish wish and yeah it's not
like a permanent thing it's like a as
and when we want it and but it's a desk
that's basically not in my flat so we're
going to see how that goes and if it
makes me feel kind of more productive
and less lonely so ten plus eight and I
want to leave here at quarter to nine so
I'm going to do my hair makeup and then
I will come back to you guys if we're
having to leave the house if I wanted to
get a past part of mentally the quarter
to but I haven't had any breakfast yet
and I'm there's no truth there so I
thought I'd just cook you some breakfast
for H Oh and very quickly making some
porridge I make my porridge with 1/3 of
oats and then 2 parts water I know lots
of use milks but I've always used water
my whole life and it tastes just as
creamy and nice but you're not having
the milk so yeah we've made it with
water I need to give this a stir
also silicone spoons best thing ever
once you go through the coat in the
wooden spoons literally make you feel
sick because they gather like a soak up
so much into them it's really quite
coarse so definitely recommend silicone
spoon this is what I'm wearing today but
I'm actually filming a would I wore in a
week's video so you will see this on
Sunday and it's really nothing that
special though like I'm off
okay I'm here and I'll quickly show you
around and there's not really much to
look at but it's a really nice kind of
clean space there's a little fridge here
where I bought some lunch today put
myself a little sandwich and then this
little end of the room area that's so
fast you're like chair and stuff and a
little table here and then you go
through here
and there are just three desks I'm going
to sit here today carry oh sit on one of
these the other ones free I think and
then there's a little bathroom at the
back I like to shower and stuff
very peaceful enhance the nice and
bright as well which is good and we're
not unpack my bag so my desk
it is one o'clock I've actually had my
lunch already performed
sandwiches me and Carrie carry them here
hello we're going to give her a little
wonder because she needs taken photos
I'd quite like to get like an Instagram
photo and also think you need to get
some fresh herbs about dressings hidden
in here it's like half dying don't well
so it's quite productive morning Carrie
less of a laptop charger though not so
productive in harens I just shot some
photos to carry his very successful and
now I've got the same cameras I kind of
know how it work which is good mixing
family and just gonna walk up and maybe
pop into a cup of shots and then I'm
going to go back Street see if I can get
one of those days I'm just like and then
we did this and then we did that but we
did just take some photos for my
Instagram if you see the one of me and
my Levi's t-shirt that the one that we
did and we're going to head back to the
office now it's like what it's too so I
want to get him I'm going to leave it
like half five six maybe so I can get
lots done
I am home and it's Friday night and I'm
feeling all right yeah I'm really happy
to be home excuse the ride and rich has
just headed out because he's known for
drinks with a friend and my friend Lucy
coming around and Lucy who you guys will
know because I've known her for years
she used to be my manager
she's not really my manager anymore she
works more high up at gleam her my like
agent so we don't really get spend as
much time together as we used to and
she's like one of my really really good
friends so she's going to come over and
hang tonight we're going to get takeaway
we gotta get Indian she's like trying to
be healthy I'm not I'm gonna go fill out
I think she's going to try and get like
healthy like maybe not get the rice and
stuff but it's really good Indian that
we've got near here and I need to make
some dessert I've got my friend Gemma's
baby shower tomorrow what's more like a
tea then like a proper formal baby
shower just so bored can I see her pushy
has a baby I'm going to make chocolate
dipped strawberries because they always
go down a treat but you have to make
them the night before and put them in
the fridge so I'll probably show you
both when I make those but I just want
to chill on the sofa I'm just watching
YouTube videos and then I will sort my
life out since I've taught three massive
things of dark chocolate I would highly
recommend using dark chocolate even if
you prefer milk chocolate I only eat
mulch October and sure
breathe so much better these dogs are oh
this is too sickly and as it just
doesn't melt as well so I'm going to
break this up put it into a bowl you can
melt chocolate by putting the bowl over
a pan of boiling water or you can
microwave it but if you microwave it
just do it really slowly and keep mixing
it because you don't want to chocolate
to burn if the chocolate burn that goes
with your bitter and you have to kind of
throw it away
I've also laid some foil out onto a
baking tray because I'm going to dip and
then lay and then I just put them in the
fridge overnight and that's all we have
to do and they look so impressive
okay I massively regret getting
Bournville because even though it says
classic dark chocolate I don't think
it's 100% dark chocolate and it's kind
of gone a bit gloopy and I can smell
that it's like more like milk chocolate
and which is that I'm you can also see
by the color it's not as dark but it's
fine it will be good so I've dipped all
of these strawberries some of them I'm
not a figure that one no one's going to
be able to get that mmm oh I've dipped
all and this is two packet strawberries
I'm not sure if it's enough whether I
should do third pack not sure if I have
space in my fridge this is the problem
here we have cleared that bottom shelf
so to put these in yeah I knew they
weren't going to fit far away I think
one tray is going to have to do there
should be a lot of other people bringing
like baked goods tomorrow so I didn't
out be fine delish and they look really
impressive now I'm just waiting for Lucy
to arrive so we can pour to our dinner
look how lovely oh look can't wait watch
my hair in the morning I forgot to vlog
dinner but we had Indian and it was
yummy and we had some chocolate
strawberries I made extra tomorrow and
we had a cup of tea and now what's your
naked attraction which is the most
ridiculous program ever where people
just and making fun of each other and
talk about it
and I kind of love this professor afloat
Lucy just went home we watch a naked
attraction is so funny if you guys don't
know it you should try and watch it
online or not it's a program in the UK
where and we like one guy or one girl
basically have like six people of the
opposite sex lined up or actually
tonight episode with a gay guy oh and
the screen lifts up and they're
basically naked and then they like judge
each one
it's very funny I describes that really
badly Oh rich is another fruit slide
provides our sign it's so annoying I'm
going to take my makeup off now get
ready for bed this is what I've been
using recently and loving the glossy a
milky jelly cleanser followed by the
glossy a super bounce serum the ceramide
in in the morning then evening the
glossy a rich moisturizer over the
glossy SPS everything's pretty much
glossy a this is the keel of midnight
recovery
I agreed even enjoying that that's kind
of it keeping things simple this I
really realize as well as beautify fruit
enzyme five-minute facial I'm going to
vlog again tomorrow so Oh speak to you
guys then good morning everyone
it is Saturday and it's about 12 o'clock
I sets until about 9:30 which is nice
and then I've just been sitting here
straightening my hair and it takes so
long but I like to kind of take my time
doing it anyway so I've been watching
Nashville and Hollyoaks and all the crap
TV that I love watching say yes to the
dress I'm going to keep do my makeup
it's funny because the weekend feels a
bit more like a wee torn because I've
been working in an office a little bit
this week I kind of like that about her
Cheryl definitely makes home feel more
like home I have almost finished my it
cosmetics CC cream I of course Emma back
up because this is pretty much the only
foundation I use at the moment but look
like you can see through I've ever ever
finished a foundation this is so great
whenever anyone asks me for a foundation
recommendation this is always the one
that I say and they now do it in
Selfridges which is so good because it
means I can actually recommend it to my
friends because my like normal non
internet friends would never show up on
Sephora online
rich is out for a run at the moment he's
training for cos he training for a man
versus mountain I think which is he's
doing it with his best mate and I think
they have to like wait is this Snowdonia
I think he's already done Snowdonia I
know you know what it is it's like a
kind of race and a challenge and like a
bit water and stuff I'd really loves
that kind of stuff so he's been running
it's actually pouring with rain I can't
believe this weather we've got I mean
I'm not surprised
in August the
we'd like the worst weather and I really
hope it's good for my friend's wedding
that's why we got married in September
because we usually get like a late
summer in the UK we get like an early
summer in a late summer but the actual
time where it's meant to be summer in
August it's always really crap weather
so Richards out for a run he just throw
me coming back and I think we're going
to grab some lunch maybe
and then I've got Gemma's little like
tea / baby shower so that would be
really nice I don't know what I'm gonna
film if anything that's going to be her
sisters and I bought her a little
present and I was going to get it anyway
it's not as a baby shower present it's
just a present and I got her to a
present for her like she wants to go and
get pedicure done gel pedicure before
she has a baby so that it's just done
which I totally get and I kind of need
to get one anyway so she asked me to
book and I booked to deployment drive-by
so I'm just going to like pay for that
and that would be a nice gift for her
and we're going to lunch or something
and then I bought a practical gift I
know if you guys know they have this
thing called is it a sleepyhead or a
sleeping pod it's like these little best
things you can like move around and a
baby can sleep on it on the sofa or on
the bed or anywhere you go Soviet my
sister loves hers and they're really
really great but my sister was telling
me how the the covers on them are not
tumble dry you can't tell me dry them so
if you wash them if the baby's like sick
or poos on them you have to let them dry
so my sister says one of the best
presence is to buy spare one a spare
cover because they're quite expensive so
quite boring practical gift but I got
her a spare covers for her sleepy head
sleepy pod I still don't know what
they're called yes that's what I've got
which I just thought would be really
useful okay this is the glossy a
concealer I've got into the habit
recently of using this because it's nice
and dewy but it's just a little bit
light for me so I'll use this first and
then I go on top with the NARS Mac
concealer which just kind of covers
anywhere with this one doesn't probably
see what I'm doing I'm trying to not put
too much makeup on because it's Saturday
I don't need it but just enjoy doing it
not sure what clouds are tonight I think
I might hang out with Gemma and burn off
the baby shower
I like to keep my weekends quite free
these days like it used to be so busy
I like to just be flexible and play it
by ear and like be able to make
spontaneous plans if I want to weird I
haven't seen Ana all week this week
which sounds a bit like drastic but
she's kind of like my colleague so it'd
be weird I think any of you guys that
works in office and see the same people
all the time imagine just like not seen
them for a week I don't know also I
spoke about this on Instagram stories I
got so many messages from people saying
they have the same thing and I have
developed weird like pigmentation on my
upper lip I think it's really really
common it kind of makes me look like a
hairy lip but if you look closely it's
not hair it's just like a little bit
darker and I think it's really common to
get on your upper lip apparently if
you're on the pill it's really common
although I've been on the pill since I
was like 15 and I'm 29 so and I haven't
changed recently so it's not really
going to be to do with that peroneal so
if you have a lot of like sun exposure
it can kind of stop I'm not rich yet
also by the way this blusher I'm
obsessed with is by Clarence in its new
and it's the illuminating cheek color in
golden pink it's so nice because it's a
pink obviously with my golden shimmer so
you can kind of use it like a
highlighter as well so a rich is
drinking out his weird running backpack
making weird Slurpee noises and what I
was saying a minute and guess we walked
in oh yeah pigmentation so apparently
you can be caused by sun as well so I'm
being really careful to make sure when I
see s1 I go over my left as well sorry
no and I'm hoping it will just fade away
and stop peeking go shallow under action
uh-huh God's like it's summer in a city
today which is like a big YouTube event
I actually haven't been TV years I went
when it first first started it was in
alexandra palace having really been
since then and i don't really I don't
know I felt like my audience isn't there
I know a lot of other youtubers and have
a similar audience to me who have gotten
which I was quite surprised about but I
just feel like it's quite a young
audience at those kind of things it's
not really oh man that's so annoying
it's not really how I like to meet you
guys I've much of had to meet you guys
in like
a proper event with a brand where you
guys get a goodie bag and it's like
there's something going on rather than a
meet-and-greet where you're queuing to
give me a hug or like a panel I quietly
in panels but I prefer doing like
industry panels and sort of it's quite
boring to you guys okay really isn't my
kind of thing so I didn't really even
think about going this year but I've
seen the looks people off so sorry if
you thought I was going but I haven't we
heard any messages about it so that's
good I'm just using the Mac groundwork
Paint Pot which is so dried up so badly
it's like come away from the edges I
usually just use my finger for this so
as I told you guys I'm film you know
what I wore in a week video this week
and so far every day I've worn jeans I'm
gonna get so many comments being like do
you wear anything interesting so the way
there's not good enough for skirts or
dresses and what else is there don't
have any like charles's I'd like some
like charts some non jeans trousers
basically but I don't have any so I feel
like it's going to be very Jean maybe
I'll call it Y wore in a week the jeans
edit it wasn't planned to be like that
okay final step is mascara this is the
Clinique high impact extreme volume
mascara and then I think I might curl my
hair because it usually drops out and
then it has like a bit of movement in it
if I just leave it there straight it
looks a bit strange and my hairdresser
said he hates it when I wear my hair
straight so that's now made me paranoid
- not on my hair straight name it
promise for lunch market main showers
kind of quite up
this is like bread with tomato if I can
most garlicky tomato sauce ever again
yeah I suppose it is quick exact yummy
varieties North event and this is over
oh my god amazing there is some prawns
with garlic and chilli and if some
people get freaked out on the heads are
on but they come off very easily I know
that sounds gross but dead fish and rich
was that so you cheated - we were like
pajama Jam are so good excuse the sound
of the washing machine but I've just
popped home to get these I'm going to
announce for the biggest ones so the key
is to use the foil because then it
doesn't stick once they didn't use foil
and as a disaster I'm going to lay these
all out in here I think that will look
really nice and then I'll put some cling
film over it and take them and hopefully
they won't smell that is my baking
effort is not great not their life I
think they will excuse me because I've
done enough enough hen organizing
recently but this chocolate strawberries
will do for the baby shower okay I have
my gift I have straub and I'm off to the
baby shower I'm back from the baby
shower and it was really really nice we
are now at Berlin Germans and we're
going to chill and we're going to have a
Chinese tonight even though I had an
Indian last night just eating all the
food apparently good morning everyone
sorry that I didn't finish logging last
night but we were hanging out jamaran
bends and sometimes I did don't feel
comfortable vlogging we were just
hanging friends and there's nothing
really to say we had Chinese and it was
so good me and rich both woke up this
morning saying that we're still so we
haven't we had breakfast yet so it's
Sunday I'm not actually going to vlog
today I just wanted to come and finish
this vlog but I also quickly got
something to do on the vlog before I
wrap it all up I need to sort out my
jeans draw may enrich and randomly both
woken up in a bit of an organization
mode he's like cleared out the kitchen
cupboards and now he's moved on to the
bottom covers he just told me that he
thinks I have shares in Tampax because I
have so many but I need to clear out my
jeans drawer because I bought three
pairs of jeans last week and those Urban
Outfitters axial ones which by the way
very
no because it all fit differently the
light denim ones and the black one fit
perfectly in the 29 I didn't try on the
medium denim ones and they're a little
bit baggy they fit around my waist but
the length bag here I'm just going to go
with it but I seriously need to clean
out my jeans these are all of my jeans I
don't think it's a crazy crazy amount I
tweeted the other day asking you guys
how many pairs of jeans you have and
some people had like 20 30 pairs so
people had to I think I'm somewhere in
between I think I've got about 12 or
something I can't remember but because
our flats so small and I'd let you just
got one draw for my jeans and my
trousers I need to cut them down one day
I really hope to have a wardrobe where I
can hang all of my jeans and just have
like a denim wardrobe because I
genuinely wear them every day I'm
currently halfway through filming my
what I wore in a week video and so far
I've been jeans every day so I do wear
them a lot but I think there might be
like one or two maybe three pairs that I
can give to charity journalist have a
look these are all of my jeans let's
actually count 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
12 13 14 15 pairs of jeans whoo okay
let's lay them all out so I can actually
remember I know some of them I won't
need to try them because I know I wear
them all the time okay so this is the
first lot of jeans I have some more here
I'm going to do them in batches so that
if you could go through the jeans that I
have these are from Gap I don't think
they sell them anymore but I got them
when I did a job with Gap they are it
says true skinny ankles so they're
skinny kind of mid-rise kind of
high-rise high-waisted jeans with
cut-offs and I actually wear these all
of the time and I really really like
them so I'm definitely keeping those
they've got a little bit of a rip in one
of the means these are the Topshop
Haydon which I bought in that video that
I did was dead I really liked them at
the time but I don't ever really tend to
wear them because they seem a little bit
too baggy I'm not really sure what the
fit of the Haydon jeans are supposed to
be but something's not quite right so
I'm going to try these on these are the
Topshop Lukas which I absolutely love
for like a boyfriend
jeans fit the only thing is my litres
are quite old and the knees are so
ripped like they're kind of specially
this one look how much this knee is
ripped it's like too much it's too big
so I actually really think I just need
to repurchase the Lucas so what I might
do is just like pick between I'll
probably end up giving both of these
away or maybe throwing these away
because they're so ripped and getting a
new pair of the Lucas you know I don't
need to try the Lucas um because I know
I know the deal there
I think these need to go and I just need
to make sure that they still do them so
I can repurchase because I actually love
the Lucas jeans these are from gap as
well they're also true skinny super high
rise so there's more highways than the
other ones they're like a light denim
and then they've got these like dark
denim patches on knees yeah this one's a
bit different to the left leg let me
open these out for you the left leg has
this like long patch and this one has
one over the knee with a rip I quite
like them because they're a little bit
different but I'm actually not sure now
looking at them is that cool or is a
little bit like school teenager II maybe
I don't really think I need these
personally I think I'm going to give
those away these are the Topshop Jamie
jeans classic kind of high-waisted
skinny I think neither just gives me to
have they've got no rips so it's good to
just have normal skinny pair of jeans
right these are the Urban Outfitters bdg
Axl jeans so this is the mid kind of
denim wash this is the light denim wash
and these are the black ones these are
all new so I'm obviously going to be
keeping these all right let me lay out
the next pair of jeans and then I'll try
all the ones I'm not sure on at the end
okay so those are the top shop Haydon
these are Topshop 3 now these the ones I
know I'm not going to keep I really
really loved these they're like a mid
denim wash and then they've got this
really fun Frane on the ankles I bought
this because Kari has them they look
really nice on her but for me I find
that they're not high-waisted enough and
also this section so like upper thigh
something about the way they sit that
just doesn't look flattering and it
means that every time I think I'm going
to wear them I end up not wearing them
so these are definitely going to go
which is shame I didn't buy them that
long ago but that was just a mistake
I should not for those these are urban
outside he same urban decay
outfitters bdg mom jeans I did the only
Monday's I can wear because they do them
in half sizes these are 29 so I should
actually get the most my hips I don't
know if they're the most flattering
jeans these also aren't that old so I'm
going to try the modern and just remind
myself if I like these or maybe now I've
got the axle maybe I don't like these as
much I'm not sure these are also from
Urban Outfitters they are I think their
mom jeans as well but they're in a
really really light denim feels almost
like a linen or something pinstripe I
think these are really different and
really cool so I'm going to heat those
so they're a bit more like trousers than
jeans these are the top shop Jamie's in
a kind of slightly darker denim with
rips
and I roll them up so the other Jamie's
I have don't have rips
I don't wear these that often but I feel
like they're quite an autumn winter Jean
and what size are they 28 yeah I think
they still fit me I think I'm going to
keep these it's just good to have skinny
jeans especially during also winter I
wear them a lot and now I have three
pairs of black jeans these two are
exactly the same these are both Topshop
Jamie jeans one seems to be more or less
a faded black and these are more of a
black black like a true black I think
that I only need to keep one I don't
know I wear black so often in the
winters of the thing maybe I'll try
these on and just see these ones are
black so Jamie's you have the Jamie's
but with the tassels at the bottom which
are really cool they do kind of fit as
nicely but it's just something a little
bit different and I like those I'm going
to keep them so I definitely don't need
three pairs of black jeans hmm do I keep
the really black ones or the faded black
ones okay so I'm trying on four pairs
I've given away three and I'm trying on
four to decide and I've kept one two
three four five six seven eight if
you've ever Topshop Hayden Jean they do
fit me but I think they're kind of buggy
in places they shouldn't be they're
quite similar to the Urban Outfitters
one I don't think they're the most
flattering ever and I just don't think
they add much to my wardrobe so then
give those away so these are the Urban
Outfitters mom jeans I like think
they're very high waisted I don't know I
don't think that my absolutely
it's like of all them so recently that I
want to hang on to them for a bit longer
and just have the option they're all
aware of them I'm going to keep them
guys are genuinely put one leg of each
gene on just so I can compare the black
jeans
I chose no because really black and
light when you want to be a bit small
but then the faded one there's more like
a time appropriate and I'm trying not to
show off too much of my pants but I just
did not to do in a situation I'm all hot
and flustered now from trying to loads
on but I've decided that the two black
jeans serve a different purpose because
the jet black ones are definitely more
for like smarter occasions when I want
to wear like shirt tucked into black
jeans and nice smart shoes or something
and then the more faded ones a bit more
like cool rock chick with like a cool
graphic tee or something so because they
serve a different purpose I'm going to
