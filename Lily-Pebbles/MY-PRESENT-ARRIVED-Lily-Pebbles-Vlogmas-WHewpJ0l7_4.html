straight answers never happened before
good morning everyone today is Friday
the 23rd of December it's Christmas Eve
Eve but I so exciting I'm feeding a
little bit sore for two reasons I think
I'm a little bit over from last and I
had like 3/4 of a bottle of wine to
myself but headache a headache he it was
really good wine actually so that's all
I'm just a bit tired but I'm so a key
from training at the gym yesterday like
my bum is absolutely killing me I can't
even walk let alone walk down stairs or
anything I had a bath this morning with
the liquid yoga didn't get into the bath
was those sumo squats they've killed me
today our plan is to I think Jim Jim
what's your name I think rich is going
to the gym with Bob and Vern and Gemma
like if ones have work now so they're
all going for like a little gym session
I was like yeah I would but now I'm
dying so I'm gonna go and sit in corner
and edit yesterday's vlog in this video
and then we need to go to my parents me
to us and start we need to make salad
for tomorrow I think we're seeing Jake
tonight our friend Jake so I don't know
maybe some fun things planned but
something very exciting just happened
this arrived which is meant to be
working from home this morning therefore
like I'm really distracting him this is
from society6 before my birthday my
sister Carly got me a voucher society6
is like a website that does loads of
different art prints and canvases and
stuff and I bought a really big print to
go above our bedroom like entryway and
I'm not very good at like buying things
online so I really hope this fits the
frame that we go and I hope it fits the
space and I don't even know but it's
like from America so I'd Dave know if I
could send it back so I'm a bit nervous
but I thought I'd open it now and show
you guys ok it's in here
okay because it's going above our
bedroom I thought that would be really
cool oh my god I'm so nervous they look
that's the frame that we got I don't
know if it's gonna fit I think it's
gonna be too big big is better than
smaller I just thought there was this
was so cause we like minimalist and
calming hearing we try to put it in the
frame slowly the Karma
the night will unfold
I never thought that I would be trying
it's wrong people keeps missing the
clouds interface so confuse this frame
has like little markings all over it how
does that even make sense like that's
stupid
maybe it's because I have the template
and those bits went along I'm sound oh
yeah because that covered it I'm gonna
have to just like order a frame for this
well that was a fail um I'm gonna need
stuffy snaps now because I'm impatient
and I want to do it now
you know yeah I'm gonna go and awesome
think put in a frame but they probably
wouldn't have a nice white one that's
the thing IKEA do such stupid sizes when
it comes to frames but they they're the
only one places that do like nice white
frame do it snap snap but when you have
like those clip frames no I like the
whiteness of that okay I'm actually
going now I'll be back in like half an
hour I'm so annoyed about this whole
situation I just got home so first of
all it turns out the print is an awkward
size not the IKEA frame and it's not a
standard sized print I ordered it from
society6 which is an American website
and it came with the option of ordering
it with a Fretlight framed but it was
way more expensive so I thought oh I'll
just go to Ikea and get a cheap frame so
one I'm annoyed I didn't order it framed
because that would have saved all of
this hassle but whatever it was
expensive so I was on my way to snappy
steps and I walked past like a local
framing place and I was like oh well it
would be much better to like go
somewhere local
I don't hate snappy snaps so I didn't
like give my money went to the local
frame in place turns out because it's
not a standard size they couldn't just
get put it in a frame they had to like
make one she quoted me something crazy
like 80 pounds I was like this is just
ridiculous like if this was something
that was really special to us like a
painting we bought from France then yeah
I'd want to like invest and framing it
properly but this is just a print from
society6 like it's not that major and
where it's going in the flat you won't
even really be able to see so I was like
no this is silly and she couldn't do it
to January anyway and I kind of want it
now so then I went to status apps
and I hate it in there the guy's so rude
and they just like I hate the service
and everything in there again it didn't
fit like a standard frame so the option
was to like cut down the print cuz the
prints got like a white border on it cut
it down a bit so it's not gonna be even
on all sides but you know I actually
don't even care anymore you hope you
have to see I just want it in a bloody
frame still cost me 40 pounds 38 pounds
for the frame and then like the rest was
like 35 pounds of the frame 5 pounds for
like cutting it down and he said he'll
do it by tomorrow I'm so annoyed I've
had to spend all that money on a frame
and it's still gonna look crap because
it's gonna have these weird borders or
uneven the whole thing's been very
stressful and I wish I just ordered it
framed I didn't realize that society6
prints are not in standard sizes now
I've learned for next time spent a lot
of money on this birthday present rich
is going to the gym with Bob and Gemma
and I'm gonna take my laptop and
headphones and hard drive and I'm gonna
sit in the corner of the gym and edit
yesterday's vlog mess because I am cool
like that
I'm gonna take my Phillip Lim bag
because this fits everything so well I'm
sitting in the corner I'm gonna edit
this lot we're gonna exercise has run
out of battery I've never had that
problem before and now I'm vlogging from
my phone which I've also never ever done
this before so I have no idea how it's
gonna come out and how long my phone
battery is even gonna last but I was
just filming the guys working out in the
gym I thought I'd do some really cool
like time-lapse thing and then I went to
check on my camera and it died so now we
are gonna go for some lunch and then I'm
gonna have to drive back home to get my
charger which is very inconvenient and
not why I planned today but this is the
penultimate vlogmas
so i didn't want to just give up and i
normally would have just given up but
i'm back we ended up going for lunch and
then
it's post office isn't boring stuff went
home and I charged my camera and now I'm
back in action I'm sorry that was the
first time I've had to fail this whole
vlogmas so I think I did pretty well
it's so dark because we'll be late it's
actually just the afternoon we're gonna
head to the shops because we need to get
an adapter for my iPad so that we can
connect to the TV musical of Waitrose
and get some food for the salad I'm
making for Christmas Eve tomorrow
and what else need to get a few other
bits and then we're gonna go to my
parents and yeah you've really missed
much we've had like a day where I felt
like really busy but I also feel like we
haven't actually done anything it's been
a bit of a weird day I'm just so tired
today after like the gym yesterday and
stuff I feel like it really kicked out
of me that's all I have to update you on
sore at the we're gonna crash here in
the Apple Store and we are on the hunt
for a cable there are a lot of actors
it's very confusing this is the cable
we're gonna get on man it's really
expensive and Ygritte story and I mean
but hopefully I'll use it more the one
to pick up some supplies for tomorrow
but also for the morning Christmas Day
morning marriage we've got the flat and
having breakfast together we've got
stuff to make salad the orange juice for
boxes and we're gonna have smoked salmon
and cream cheese bagels because this
morning
and I got myself a little treat for now
just at my mom and dad's house mom's
reading a magazine look he's in it
Caroline a noun car with Jake and we are
going for dinner we were going to go for
Thai because we've got a whole weekend
of eating like Christmas food but Jake's
never been to do Shoom so we're going to
take him there if I can't believe he
hasn't been and they'll probably be a
massive queue because it's Friday night
but they do give you like try when
you're waiting and like mint tea so
hopefully you went to get too cold and
wet we'll see how long the keepers guys
this is the beauty of London at
Christmas I was telling you the s said
everyone goes home I don't think there's
a queue it assume this is like unheard
of first time I'd assume just walking
these straightens has never happened
before how excited to see a 20-minute
wait but with five menacwy Kendrick how
crazy is this we were just saying like
this is what London is like with only
Londoners them
like what my the empathy iconic include
some melons Thanks mystery is that our
fashion yeah and there's a giant our
time I see
promised it
yeah
we got able the waitress thinks we over
ordered so I was like no I'm confident
because last time we came here with
Lehman Carrie and the guy was like judge
doesn't know order
they always worry and here we have
vegetable samosas calamari and other
fries now we have chicken Ruby lamb
chops doll writes masala for garlic naan
she's not hope you guys hungry

much finished everything and how you
feeling was it good for your first try
we finished at the zoom and it was as
delicious as ever how did you feel about
your first assume it was delicious fart
very full very full and now I'm just
thinking about turkey dinners that we've
got to do and also Jake's allergic to
nuts and when we set up told that they
were like there's only one dish with
nuts in it good for just so you know any
nut allergy people out there it was very
easy we're now heading back to the car I
want to go to bed and have a cup of tea
mm-hmm home sweet home
Toyama blossoms looking forward to
hiding a cup of tea I think I'm gonna
start 18th days of log although I don't
know how much I actually films because
my camera died halfway through the day
it was really nice to see Jake but the
evening's didn't get to see him that
often he doesn't really live in London
full-time so that was really nice
evening
this is all the stuff we got to make the
salad tomorrow put this away get rid of
the chicken super it's not gonna eat our
way before Christmas so salad she's

read it and I'm like can't couldn't
shake so I keep looking because I kind
of want to watch it but I don't was it
