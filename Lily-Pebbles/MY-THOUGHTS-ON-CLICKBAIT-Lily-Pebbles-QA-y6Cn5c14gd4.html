my Q&amp;amp;A I really hope you enjoyed the
last one if you haven't seen it I will
link it here I answered lots of personal
questions but now I am going to get onto
all the work II YouTube related ones and
as I said in the last Q&amp;amp;A I haven't
avoided any of the sticky questions so
I'm going to try my best to answer them
if I can and I'm going to start
straightaway
I'm not going to babble this time so
it's going to be another long video and
this question is from Lisa she asked are
you working for yourself and do you find
it difficult to constantly keep
work-life balance do you ever feel
guilty if you do very little during a
weekday
I feel more guilty if I work on the
weekends because that's really annoying
for rich but I do try and balance it
there were some times during the week
where I'll go and see one of my nieces
or nephews because I know that I work a
lot on the weekends as well my videos go
up and Sunday and I like to reply to
comments and I like to share it on
social media and the Sunday always feels
like a bit of a workday it's very hard
to get that work-life balance when you
have a job like mine because everything
comes into play like social media
sharing what I'm doing is all part of it
I do find it really hard to switch off
and it does make me feel like I'm
sometimes busier than I actually am I
think some people are very good at it
and it's quite good that kind of an
evening she won't have her phone near
her and she really switches off it's
something I need to learn but I do what
they feel like this is probably the only
time in my life where I'm going to be
like this so I might as I just kind of
go in hard but I've learned over the
past few years you know now I go work
weekends like back in the day I worked
all weekends as well as during the week
so I try and have a balance but yes it's
difficult so she when you live in a
small place like my whole flat just
feels like my office to me Amy asked
what might a time of break down on an
average work day look for you
I follow those two types of work days a
work day at home and a work day out in
town because there's no point me going
to and back from town so if I've got a
meeting I'll try and plan everything
around that day so at home day like
today I wake up at my lumbers of a court
close to 8:00 I probably get out of bed
at 8:00 I do my skincare whatever get
ready I should I get ready shower
skincare straight to my desk don't
really have breakfast
violet 8:30
I'll do emails and maybe my bullet
journal to plan out my day and then I'll
do my hair and makeup that probably only
if I'm filming if I'm not filming I
don't do my hair and makeup but it does
make me feel better so if I have the
time
I will do it because I'll feel more like
myself always in tracksuit bottoms like
I am now then I might set up filming
takes a half an hour to set up it takes
about an hour hour and a half maybe to
film like simple videos and then I have
to pack down and kind of make my lounge
look like a lounge again then I might
have a lunch break I tend to make my
food but then I'll eat at my desk catch
up on emails again and then I'll maybe
start editing in that video and sorted
out the thumbnail that probably takes
all afternoons emails in between as well
of planning of other projects going on
and which gets back about 7:00 I'm
normally still at my desk and that's
kind of how it goes sometimes I work in
the evenings on the sofa and out day
would be like a meeting breakfast
meeting at 9:30 to 10:30 I normally just
have meetings throughout the day and
I'll go back to glean my agent in
between sort of my fear box and have
meetings with them about other things
that are going on and I'll normally stay
in town from like 9:00 until 7:00 but
every day is different
dawn asked what does rich do for a job
rich works in market research you guys
might think of market research as like
surveys or focus groups that his team
specifically works on new creative ways
to do research so they'll use like 360
cameras in someone's lounge to capture
what they're watching on TV although use
a virtual reality so someone can walk
around a supermarket like wearing those
goggles and you can see their reactions
and their heart rate so he comes up with
really new modern creative ways to do
market research any house it's like a
full time normal office Monday to Friday
job Garima are as a content creator what
are your thoughts on some bigger
youtubers who now have pas who edit
their videos for them maybe there's a
valid reason by kind of seeing it paying
someone else to do your work I think
it's important to remember that with any
business as you grow you need more help
that's something I need to learn because
there's only so much you can do when
you're on your own I currently don't
have anyone helping me but I'm totally
thinking about getting someone
help me but everyone's different in
terms of what they want help with some
youtubers hate editing so they'll get
someone to help them edit whereas I love
editing and for me that feels like the
part that makes me a youtuber that feels
like the creative part of if I'm working
with a brand I feel like they're working
with me because they because of this
like video that I've created I've
planned it I've edited it obviously I
can't always film it because I have to
be in it there's just so much you can do
alone and I understand that some people
would need two people to help them edit
and film and all different things if you
wish it was more transparent when
someone else is edited the video only
because I feel like if someone has spent
seven hours editing a video themselves
figuring out how to use Final Cut Pro
when they don't really know and like
learning all these things it's nice to
get the credit for that just it's hard
to kind of if no one's saying who's
editing their videos I don't know I
don't mean that to sound like at the
competition because it really isn't I
just always think this you should be as
transparent as you can with your
audience and that's what I always try to
do someone helps me film I'll write in
the description box that someone's help
me film someone help me edit I will
although I've never had that before just
cuz I love editing so I think it's cool
that vloggers are building teams for
people around them but as I said I just
wish it was more transparent flower ask
do you feel the pressure to limit your
voice so not to offend anyone I mean
this in a way of rarely talking about
politics and humanitarian issues etc and
there were lots of questions similar to
this about like I know you have opinions
and things like bricks it and shrimp why
didn't you ever talk about it you never
discussed politics there are so many
questions about this and I was trying to
think of how to explain why because yes
course I'm opinionated firstly that's
not what this channel is supposed to be
about and everyone is entitled to choose
what they discuss on their own YouTube
channel no matter what is going on in
the world no one should feel pressure to
talk about things because you know they
might want to work beauty they might
want to what fashion and that's okay you
don't have to feel like you have to give
your full personality to the Internet
you know it's not prison that's one part
of it another part is sometimes there's
just a time in a place for talking about
things when I'm with my friends we'll
sit at dinner and we'll discuss
all kinds of things for example I might
say to my friend I might so much brexit
or something political but then say I
said something wrong my friend would say
to me no that's wrong
this guy's part of it and I'd go oh yeah
okay sorry and that would be that if you
say something that's slightly wrong or
you make a mistake
in video on the internet it's like
you're held down your health for that
for so long and gossip websites are talk
about you and there'll be hundreds of
comments of people having a go at you
and when you're this side of the
comments and they're just coming at you
non-stop it's it's there's no room for
conversation there's no room for
mistakes so there's some things I don't
feel comfortable talking about because I
don't understand no I'm saying the
correct the politically correct thing
and it is not the place to have a
discussion I prefer to have a discussion
with my friends over dinner with people
who I trust in people whose opinions I
respect and 90% of you guys I would
probably love to have those sort of
chapters in real life and I would
respect your opinion but there's always
that 10% of people who I would never
choose to hang out with in real life and
they're the ones who shout louder so
that is my reason and I hope that made
sense so gia asked how do you tackle
hate comments discouraging comment I
feel like I would say it wouldn't affect
me but I feel like it would especially
as my anxieties but I'm worse as I've
got older so back in the day I used to
always say that hate comments didn't
affect me and I didn't get them that bad
but things change and I've always been
honest about the fact that comments
about how I look literally I don't care
because it's just a stranger telling me
they don't like the way I look and that
doesn't bother me but the more I do
YouTube they are affecting me more and
more from honest just because it's a
little bit overwhelming even if it's not
hate even if someone's pointing out a
mistake you've made that person
commenting feels like they're the only
one but the reality is there's probably
300 other comments they're the same it's
hard to not feel overwhelmed by it when
you've got hundreds of comments coming
your way about something you've done
wrong with on the you've said wrong and
it's probably the most exhausting part
of what I do and it's probably the
hardest part and
it would make me not want to do it
anymore so at the moment I'm trying to
figure out a way to make it so that I
can continue doing YouTube but enjoy it
because honestly the comments do make it
not enjoyable I'm sure in this Q&amp;amp;A or
the last to know there's going to be
some kind of like anger in the comments
and it's it's a very lonely place for
the youtuber because you feel personally
attacked and you feel very alone in your
own little comments section and I know
I'm not alone I know a lot of other
youtubers feel the same but it always
feels personal and rich won't even
understand how it feels even if I tell
him about something it's personal to me
so that's really hard to deal with
Michael asks I'm definitely in that
category of people who don't usually
comment so my question is how do you
feel about clickbait more specifically
where do you think the line is drawn so
for those of you that don't know trick
bait is a way of titling your videos
that had tricks the audience into
watching it and I think there's
definitely a line and here would be my
example say I do a vlog and in that blog
I have a quick conversation with you
guys about my ex boyfriends and breakups
and like how I broke up with my
ex-boyfriend if I were using clickbait I
was type of that video we broke up
exclamation mark and the thumbnail would
be me crying so you guys think oh my
boys have lily and rich broken up you
think all these things I want to watch
that cuz I wanna know if they've broken
up whereas if I use the thumbnail of me
like 15 talking to you guys and the
title was talking about ex-boyfriends
then yeah okay maybe that's still trying
to get you to watch the video but it's
not misleading you because in the video
I am talking about ex-boyfriend there's
a line between misleading your audience
and not and I know some of youtube if
you actually really respect to talked
about this and says that why wouldn't I
use clickbait because this is my
business and I want to get as many views
as possible but I want to be as honest
as possible and it's a funny game
YouTube it's all about like titling your
videos cleverly you know my my leather
skirt video I realized - not putting
that up for my favorite videos and it
didn't do as well as my others because I
put how to start a leather skirt and
lots of people told me oh but I don't
wear skirt so I didn't
 so if I'd titled that videos my
current favorite outfit it would have
got more views but do you want to be
honest or do want to trick your audience
into watching your videos I just I
always think what would my friends think
Anna asked hey Lily do you think there
are a lot of youtubers who do add videos
without even liking the products so many
controversial questions in this Q&amp;amp;A can
you as a YouTube yourself telethon lying
about liking or using them and what do
you think about ad videos in general I
try not to concern myself about what
other people are doing too much back in
the day when it was a really small
community we all kind of work together
to create an industry that we wanted to
create but now there's so many people
doing it you just can't concern yourself
with what other people are doing because
it would drive you insane and I have had
that before where I get really upset
about what other people doing and if
they're being dishonest but you just
can't live like that so all I can do is
do what I want to do people are very
nervous about our videos as in viewers
because they don't really understand the
process because kind of tricky to talk
about in short I'll kind of explain to
you guys how the process of an add video
work a brand will either approach me
directly or come through my agent and
they'll say we really want to work with
Lily and before any money or anything is
discussed I'll say let me try the
product so let's put available dates of
each product let me try them SCARA I
want to see if I like it or not and the
first thing I do is decide if I like it
or not because for me there's no point
promoting a product that I'd like it's
dishonest it's detrimental to my videos
and you know this is no point the first
thing I do is try it if I like the
products I'll say yeah I like this
product what sort of thing you thinking
of doing support if you guys to remember
that this is business it's marketing
business for the brand's so this is the
same source of budget this is the same
thing as they were advertising in a
magazine or the TV you know they're
choosing to spend their budget on
youtubers so it's important and it can't
just be silly work
the process has to be done properly
saying that though it's a very different
way of advertising and I think we are so
lucky like me and you guys as consumers
are so lucky that this new web
advertising has come in because back in
the day you'd watch a TV ad or region ad
in a newspaper in a magazine and
celebrity would be endorsing a put
and you have no idea if they like it or
not whereas I feel like with us you can
trust us to really talk to you guys on a
level I think there's so much more room
for being created but I think it's
actually a really positive thing but
anyway I'll say I like the product and
I'll say how do you want to work
together the brand obviously because
there's they're putting budget towards
this will have a few key messages that
they want to get across because normally
it works into a much wider campaign are
doing in magazines and TV and they'll
say our campaign is all about being
happy in spring and embracing and you
you and they're normally done a very
marketing key messages and we don't just
go okay there's a lot of back-and-forth
where we say I don't feel comfortable
talking about feeling happy and spring
because my audience know that I'm not a
very positive person
how about and we'll go back and forth
and I'll go how about we talk about how
this product makes me feel instead this
is such a stupid example but there's a
lot of spectrum for so that my
responsibility is to make sure that I am
integrating this product in a way that I
know you guys will like that's my
responsibility and the brand are trying
to integrate the product in a way that
will fit with their campaign there's a
lot of back-and-forth and then we'll get
to a place where I'll say yeah I feel
comfortable with this is it going to be
in a blog we're going to do a new video
they're going to be on Instagram or
Twitter am I going to do a video for
your channel is lots of different ways
we work together and it's a long process
and guys I can't stress enough how my
top priority is always how I think you
guys are going to react and what I think
use how I you would like to kind of
consume the message so I hope you trust
me in that but I personally love doing
add videos not only because it's where I
make a living but it's a chance for me
to even be more creative and I'm getting
funded to create this piece of content I
know I said spend a whole day on it I
can hire someone to help me film it I
can put so much effort in and it's
really you know I love working to a
brief and trying to create something
that I think would be great and that the
brand would be happy and you'll be happy
and I'll be happy and sometimes it
doesn't work there's been lots of
mistakes along the way
but when it worked for me coming from a
marketing background I loved it see I
hope everyone's honest but I can't
control what everyone does cursey asked
I was wondering how you stay true to
your own star
creativity in your job when there are so
many other people doing what you do
especially when it's creative thing
which I suppose can be harder to compare
yourself to others how do you deal with
self-doubt yeah it's really hard to keep
creative and the thing I find most
frustrating is when people think I've
copied someone else it's a fine line
between being inspired by someone which
i think is what it's all about really
and copying them flat out also sometimes
you'll work for weeks on a video and
then someone else a part of the same
video before you do and you're like oh
I'm not going to scrap it I'm going to
do it anyway the world is full of
copycats the world is also full of
people who call people copycats
I think you just have to do what you do
I just I just try I try so hard not to
compare myself to others it's hard it's
hard to do but I think it is important
Maryna us tell us about the statistics
of your channel what age is your
youngest oldest viewer and what is the
less expected country you have viewers
from ok I'm going to put my stats on the
screen now and also I'm going to look at
them on my phone they might be a bit
different when I actually put them up
I'm more than happy to share my stats of
you guys
okay so 95.9% of my audience are female
and 4.1 percent are male my biggest age
audience is 25 to 34 that makes forty
two point seven percent of my audience
and then the next one down is 18 to 24
the next one down is 35 44 and then
pretty much joined its forty five to six
before thirteen seventeen I think a lot
of people assume that we youtubers have
a teenage audience that's my fifth maybe
even six audience so it's mainly 18 to
35 really but I know that lots of you
guys that outside of these age groups
this is just how YouTube tell me top
countries at UK US Germany Australia and
then Canada and yeah I think that's mean
maybe I could see okay I'm gonna scroll
down the one right is Abbasid 0.2%
Bulgaria beyond infinity are in my 20s
and feeling so lost at the moment do you
have any advice for a student who's
about to start find a job how to
motivate yourself in life when you seem
to be stuck in the same place now is
your time it's the only time in your
life really where you can truly
experiment and try everything so I would
say just try the all different kinds of
jobs even if there's crazy
try out lots of things
internships that you're not committed
you know don't get a full-time job job
get a few too much internships and just
try out as many things as possible and
figure out what you love now is the time
to do it Rowena said I've literally
never asked the Q&amp;amp;A question but mine is
what do you think of the increasingly
overt consumerism particularly around
designer bags etc that is more and more
than norm on YouTube I know that a lot
of loggers are getting a fair bit of
criticism around this and it does feel
very unrelatable for the majority of
people and I also worry about how it
affects and then the sentence cutoff but
as she bet she's going to say like
younger audience and how do I feel about
it I don't know if it's my place to say
how I personally feel about it hmmm let
me think about this one
I think everyone's entitled to do what
they want to do I personally feel like
it's really important to set up your
life so get property save for the future
all of those things are very important
to me after you've done that buying
yourself to design a bag every now and
again why not that's kind of how I live
my life I buy all my clothes from
Topshop and I saw a bioloid designer bag
every now and again but really my
priority is getting a house and saving
for my kids and anyone can do what they
want to do though I get we are saying I
don't think people who share their
luxury lifestyle should be getting paid
for it as a viewer I don't love it but
then the way I would react is by
unsubscribing or not watching and I
think that's the problem with the
internet if you don't like it that's
okay bitch to your friends about it
offline but I don't get people who leave
hate comments just unsubscribe and move
on there are lots of people whose
YouTube channels I don't like and don't
agree with but I just unsubscribe or I
just don't watch them or I just watch
them and then growl at myself I don't
comment I think that might have answered
your question these are some questions
about the future Finch
after you ever see yourself moving out
of London no I love it
I know there will be times where it's
really hard it's very expensive but the
opportunity I had to intern at all these
amazing places because I could live with
my parents free in London I want to do
that for my children so I really want to
work hard today in London so that they
don't feel like they have to move to
London and pay rent when they
in their 20s I want to kind of have a
house set up in London so they can stay
with me until they need to Yasmine asked
what travel destinations are still on
your bucket list Canada Japan New
Zealand Kelly asked my question is do
you think there will ever be a time in
the future where you will naturally not
upload videos anymore as you become
older among different priorities etc and
your job will change as such
thank you love you LP Thanks yes I used
to say that I think my channel would
evolve and change with me as I become a
mum actually now I'm getting older and
I'm starting to think do I want to do
that do I want to film my kids and put
them on the Internet
it's a little bit funny about that I
start a topic I'm really interested in
and I don't have an opinion on it I'm
just fascinated to know what people
think of it like filming your kids and
putting them on the internet I don't
know how you keep them safe at the same
time if your kind of filming your front
of your house and you're filming your
child what if someone recognizes them I
get very paranoid about like privacy so
I don't think I'll be the sort of mom
that will want to share everything about
my child I don't judge people who do I'm
just saying that I don't think that's
what I want to do so I'm always thinking
about how my job can evolve as I get
older something I'm thinking about all
the time at the moment and I don't
really know to be honest what the answer
is but don't think I'll be doing YouTube
forever I might be doing it in some
capacity but whether it's this kind of
full-on and full time I'm not sure okay
so here is some more like silly
questions Rebecca on I have a question
any hen party planning tips I'm feeling
the pressure with my big sisters hen
next month a hen is a bachelorette party
if you're not from the UK I would say
like if you're from somewhere that can
be great social from London or another
city don't waste your money on
accommodation I think a hen party spread
over a weekend where people stay in
their own houses can be great as well
like a Friday night dinner and then a
fun activity on the Saturday and a night
out a Saturday night maybe like a little
tea on a Sunday you can spread it out
and if you're not paying for
accommodation so much more you can do
with your budget for activities don't
make it too expensive I think it's
always mean on people who have lots of
hens to go out throughout the year but
look at the time out and see what cool
activities there are going on lots of
like bonding games for people to get
some
know each other what other hand policy
tips do I have make sure you plan the
hen for the hen for the person's getting
married think about what they'd actually
won don't worry about all the guests
this is for your friend Chloe our choose
your favorite Grey's Anatomy character
dead or alive definitely George O'Malley
that episode where they realized it was
him in the hospital was epic Christine
said if you could have dinner with any
three people who have passed who would
you pick my three grandparents my
grandma and both my grandpa's but it
would be very complicated to try and
space and why do Victoria are and this
is the final question I think yeah Lily

wanted to add the thing because it's so
nice Lily I don't have a question for
the Q&amp;amp;A

that it is so refreshing to scroll
through these comments and it's so nice

brilliant so thank you guys so much for
