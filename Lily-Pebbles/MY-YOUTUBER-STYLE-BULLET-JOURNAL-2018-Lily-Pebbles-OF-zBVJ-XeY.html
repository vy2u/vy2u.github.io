well I promised you this year I would do
another bullet journal video if you
don't know what a bullet journal is
please go watch my video from last year
because I fully explain the concept and
what it is and I'm not going to bore you
again and re-explained all of that but I
have been doing a bullet journal in kind
of my my way of doing it since 2016 yeah
I've got 2016 here and then I've got my
2017 one and this is my 2018 one so for
today's video I thought I would quickly
flick through my 2017 bullet journal and
show you the things that I won't be
doing this year and then I will show you
my 2018 bullet journal and how I plan to
use my journal this year just a
disclaimer I use my bullet journal in a
very simple way there are people who do
amazing pages and it looks beautiful and
illustrations I don't have time for that
and it's not really what I want to do I
use my gun at journal just to organize
my brain and have something quick to
refer to I don't have time to kind of
sit there and doodle and make things
pretty I tried it in my first one and it
didn't work for me so this year I've cut
it back even further and it was very
very basic so if you are after something
a bit more exciting then there are lots
of other videos just type in bullet
journal 2018 but if you wasn't very
simple and also this is very relevant if
you are a blogger or youtuber then I
hope you enjoy this video I ordered
another one of the bullet journal I
never know how to pronounce these
notebooks you can get just the original
one I just like this because it has the
index already in it and also I like that
this is bullet journal in the front and
then to put my name in the year I just
use my diamond label maker so I'm gonna
get straight to the video now and stop
rambling on okay let's take a look at my
2017 bullet journal so at the beginning
I've just got my name and email address
and then I've got my index I still
absolutely love the concept of an index
it's so easy to find what I'm looking
for so I'm definitely going to be
continuing using that then what I did
last year was I had a month-by-month
kind of calendar and I decided this year
not to use this just because I didn't
really end up referring to it much I use
the calendar on my phone and I kind
know what's coming up so this just felt
like wasted space to me really oh my God
look how busy Mae was I know I ended up
not really putting much stuff in here so
I'm not doing the future look this year
on the next page I did 2017 goals
I've got meat and spend time with more
creative people which I think I did
become comfortable and confident working
on full-time female which was the
original name for my original book I did
obviously I changed it to the f-word
that definitely happened and take more
non-work photos I also did that too then
I had a stats tracker which I've just
covered because some of these stats
aren't public I kept forgetting to do
this so I'm not gonna be doing a stats
tracker this year I'm actually not doing
either of these pages I've got a blog
post coming up on why I don't have any
goals for 2018 and stats tracker it's
just it just stats don't mean anything
to me anymore I don't really care about
them I thought I would do this just to
see out of interest but I ended up just
forgetting every month so I won't be
doing the stats tracker next year ok so
then this is my content calendar and I'm
definitely going to be doing this again
next year it's just so easy for me to
plan my videos and my blog posts for
those asking these letters at the top so
the top row is for blog posts and it
starts with photos text links scheduled
and then the bottom row is filmed edited
some nail info which means like
description box scheduled so I've got
the days of the week and then the
numbers and at the bottom I've got notes
just to remind me of anything whilst I'm
filming so I'm definitely keeping that
for next year oh my god look October off
these are just random pages I've used
for like planning videos like January
favorites video ideas for 2017 and then
the rest is all just kind of planning
videos and to-do lists so let's go on to
my 2018 journal it's obviously always
way more neater at the beginning but I
just love spending time and December
like getting it already so because this
is the bullet journal you get these kind
of tips and stuff which I guess I don't
really need so I've started the index
here and then I've got my content
planning calendars I've actually changed
the letters this year I've just got
photos text scheduled on my blog and
then filmed edited info and schedule so
that is
kind of content planning and I've drawn
all of those out I haven't got the notes
at the bottom for the fan I wasn't using
this as much but I can always add them
in if I change my mind
so I've done every single month and then
I've got a jobs tracker which this is
probably only relevant to kind of
youtubers and bloggers but for me I just
think it'd be really interesting and
helpful to see how many different jobs
that's when I work with a brand unlike a
paid job for me it'll be really helpful
to make sure I'm not doing three
sponsored instagrams in one week or
anything it's sometimes it's hard to
control when jobs overlap because it's
not really up to us when things go up
but anyway I think I'll be really good
to have an overview of when I have jobs
with brands so I've just done the month
and then the days like this so I can
just put the brand name next to it I've
done that all the way to the end of the
year and then I thought I might as well
have a designated place for monthly
favorites because what I was doing is I
was just writing the odd kind of page
here and there planning my monthly
favorites but I can also never remember
if I've mentioned something before if I
talked about it in the previous month's
favorites video so I've kind of planned
out a favorites monthly favorites video
planner so I've just put monthly
favorites and then I've just got the
month and I could just literally list
out the favorites and maybe I'll change
this so I've got like item price I don't
know it's not always relevant to put the
price of the item but I can add whatever
notes I want in these sections so that
all the way up to the end of the year
and then this is the F word timeline so
this is just timeline for me to know
when things are happening with the book
and I can just put the date in here and
then what the kind of action is and I
can keep adding to that as I know more
about the timeline and then I just put
notes things to him for me to remember
to do and then video I do all I've got
at the moment is Q&amp;amp;A with Emma Gannon
because I really want to do a video with
her and there's nothing else there at
the moment so everything else is plain
and for those asking I didn't actually
finish my 2017 book I got about halfway
through and I know it's a bit kind of
wasteful to buy a new one but I really
wanted to start afresh and I think with
this one I'm probably going to continue
it on to 2019 and what I'll do is I'll
just put one of these kind of page
dividers down and then start again I'm
going to try really hard to keep this
one neat this year but I just love how
simple it is it's just got exactly what
I need
in there no extra faff and I'm really
happy with her
I love January I can't wait to get
started so I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video let me know what you
think and if you're planning on doing a
bullet journal for 2018 if you have any
cool pages that you think would be
relevant to what I do please do let me
know and I think that's all for today so
good luck with your bullet journal in
2018 please send me photos on Instagram
or wherever if you do end up doing one I
would love to see them and I'll see you
guys in my next video
