little kind of make up store everyday
makeup look kind of thing this is the
brown smokey eye that I've been wearing
a lot recently if you read my blog and
see my what's in my face purse I've done
this combo quite a few times and I kind
of like it jewy skin brown smokey eye
and a new lip product as well thanks for
watching and enjoy so it just hits my
hair back and I'm going to get started
as you can see my skin it isn't great at
the moment I get kind of little bumps
under my skin and it's a bit red in
areas but it's all right I already put
on my parents instant smooth perfecting
touch primer which I'm trying at them
and I quite like it's a little bit kind
of greasy feeling for me but it's okay
and then I'm going to use my Laura
Mercier radiance primer I just put this
all over and it's a really nice glowy
finish I really like this is base under
makeup it gives that kind of jewy lip
and then I'm going to be using a
combination of laura mercier silk creme
foundation and this because this is
probably the lightest foundation i have
and my skin is really pale at the moment
and this is in the color cream ivory I
do find it quite thick and a bit like
pink like so I'm going to mix it with a
bit of the clarins instant light
complexion Perfector in 00 rose shimmer
and this kind of just thins out and
makes it easier to use so I just put
them both in the back of my hand and
then just rub them together and kind of
mix them up and then just using my
finger while it's all robbed in I just
dab a bit of foundation in the places
where I want it and then i'm using my
Real Techniques buffing brush just to
buff that in all over the skin and
really work it in so has a natural
finish I only really use this brush for
heavier foundations I normally use my
stippling brush for and you have lighter
ones but with this kind of foundation i
think the buffing brush works the best
just really work if the skin I always go
down a bit onto my neck as well so it
looks natural then what's left on my
hand I was just take a bit and add it
anywhere that I need extra coverage so
the foundation is done and I'm now going
to use my favorites
concealer combination which is Bobby
Brown corrector in like bisque and I'm
just using a jemi kid brush to put this
under my eyes and this really helps to
get rid of my dark circles which as you
can see i have really badly at the
moment and then I just blend out using a
Mac t24 I really like using a brush for
under-eye concealer because it means
you're not dragging your eye with your
finger which obviously causes kind of
wrinkles and stuff and I just also think
it gives a cut nice flawless finish I
then take my origins plant scription
concealer which absolutely love add a
bit more under my eyes where I need a
bit more coverage down my nose around my
nose and on my chin and just blend that
I love this concealer kits really
moisturizing it doesn't leave like a
cakey look on your face ok so now I'm
going to go on to my eyes because I'm
doing a bit of a kind of smoky eye look
so I'm going to my face afterwards and
I'm going to use one of the Estee Lauder
you stay on shadow paints and this isn't
chained I talked about this in my
monthly favorites video and it apps that
you love it it's a gorgeous bronzy color
I'm going to use a brush because it's
quite a new seat formula so I befo using
a brush and just sweep that all over the
lid it's really easy to blend but you do
have to kind of be quick blend it over
the other eye I'm using a mac 217 for
this which I love for blending I'm also
going to take a bits off the same cream
shadow just under the eye i'm going to
put another eye shadow on top so this
kind of acts like a primer and i miss
the eye shadow grips are really easily
the eye shadow i'm going to use on top
is from urban decay dangerous palettes i
think it's the dangerous palette and
it's the color depot which is this one
here and it's a really nice bronzy color
and i just loved using this reason
you're probably if you read my blog you
would have seen it quite a few posts and
it looks really nice over this
cream shadow she was going to take a bit
of that on a different 2 17 brush take
the excess off in your hand because he's
a really pigmented shutters and then
just apply that on top and then going to
take the 207 i use for the cream shadow
and use that to just blend out so the
edges aren't harsh and they're nice and
soft I love this color it's like an
antiquey bones I've had a tiny bit of
shadow fall down so I'm just going to
take my foundation brush and just blend
it out and then taking a smaller brush
and some of the Urban Decay eyeshadow
and just taking that under the eye so
that's all that I shadowed done and to
finish the eyes i'm going to use a brown
eyeliner and this is the NYX or nicks
one and I just like using a brown
eyeliner to kind of finish off the
overall I look so I'm just going to run
this across the top lash line I'm trying
to keep it quite close to the lashes
that I don't anything too dramatic and
I'm taking the same small brush that
used under the eye and just blending it
out a little bit so it's softer these
knicks eyeliners are so creamy in self I
love them then just make sure the
corners add together nicely ok so the
iron is done and I'm going to use my
favorite mascara at the moment which is
the technique high impact extreme volume
mascara and just watch this mascara it's
incredible
it gives so much length and volume I
absolutely love it and I'm just going to
do the top lashes because I don't really
tend to do the bottom ones unless I'm
going on a big night out so then on to
the face and I clearly need to warm up
my face is very pale and with the brass
mocha I it makes me look even more pale
so I'm gonna use the shoe a bronzer and
this is the hydrating bronzer which I
really really like about my nose one but
this is kind of just as good and I'm
just going to put that in the contours
of my cheeks and up to my temples I'm
just using a real techniques blush brush
which is my favorite for bronzer also
going to take that down onto my neck a
bit so that my face doesn't look too
much darker than my neck a little bit
down my nose you can see that's kind of
warmed up my face quite a bit and for
blusher i'm going to use mac stereo
raise because this kind of doubles up
there's a blush and highlighter do want
to use a highlight as well because i've
already used kind of radiance primer and
the Clarins instant light so i'm just
going to take a bit of this and put on
the back of my hand and then because
it's kind of a highlight going to use it
bit higher up on my cheeks and I
normally would with my blush I think
it's really pretty already like it and
that's the blusher and then I think
that's kind of everything I'm just going
to finish with the lips I'm going to use
one of the new Rimmel apocalypse which
really cool kind of a lipstick lipgloss
combo kind of thing and this is in the
color celestial which is a very rosy
pink natural color so it goes on really
liquidy as you can see
and then I'm just going to block my lips
kiss a little bit wet for me that kind
of blotted Matt look and that's final
look say thank you for watching and I
hope you enjoyed it bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
