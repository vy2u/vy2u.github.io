today I'm dressed like a librarian
apparently but I love this dress so I
could jump her and skirt attached it
some cause and it's probably very
unflattering but it's the comfiest thing
ever and I am all about comfort wow that
is a lot of toilet roll there what is
this for I think someone went to Costco
recently so I'm trying to be good and
take probiotics every morning I keep
forgetting to take them though because I
hardly ever eat breakfast and you might
to take them before you eat breakfast
but let me know if any of you guys also
take probiotics and whether they make
you feel any different
so when you renew your driving license
or apply for a new one there's a box
that asks you if something terrible to
happen do you want to donate your organs
and tissue and stuffing it's revolting
horrible as it sounds I was like you
know what whatever I'd be dead so yeah
okay I just ticked it open and um we're
easy then they send me the stuff that's
like thanks for joining the organ donor
and all these letters I don't want to
think about it that's just freaking me
out I feel like I've jinxed myself now
let's find just the ticket box but I do
not want letters about my organs thank
you very much
okay I've mentioned this in a daily mix
video was inspired this weird habit
where I have to wear socks over my
tights it's always my toes feel weird in
my tights does anyone else to do that
it's quite annoying because sometimes my
shoes feel too tight but I always have
to wear socks so in life but growth and
we're trying to find the station because
I'm gonna pick up Gemma before we go
into offices and my sisters in here they
always make fun of me saying hi guys
just got to innocent towers look at this
amazing man it's very if I like I need
to touch it it's not as soft as it looks
Gemma's here I excited to see inside
hello I am that's my boob that is your
boobs sorry
my mitosis is why we all put them in
different places that's my boob
this is the office look how cool this is
these are some of the hats that people
have sent in for the big knit to a unit
your own hat that goes on there I love
smoothies and this is a wall of baby
photos of everyone who works here oh
that's a nice odor which is happening to
the tour of the office it's very
exciting I already want to work here
this crit stick is on the ceiling and
there is a story but it's a secret
this ladder leads to the helipad that
doesn't exist
yeah funniest traditions day every
Friday at 5 o'clock they played Phil
Collins and the other cook in that it's
home time everyone is the bank of
something I'm gonna start there that's
how I go to my desk in my office I'm
gonna do that these are the awards they
do an award ceremony every year and this
one the fortune teller award is for
someone has to guess how many portions
of fruit Virgil so today and probably no
one would he ever gets it right but you
can ask something if you do so one guy
said he gets how many said if I get it
right I wants huge something you know
they said well done you're like year's
ease there's a Lego wall in here Bailey
would die how much would be need of this
wall JJ so could you let these are just
boards yeah
JJ make it for him go on what you're
maybe I'm doing this person he was gonna
ruin their lego don't tell baby I love
how she's talking it she's talking to
Bailey in the camera like
these are some of the best really have
they've ever had knitted or the vignette
this is my personal favorite I would
definitely buy like a ferret in Jessica
boys what is it it's it's a we all
matter yeah that sounds like the Sheep I
like blowing through the bag please the
truth beat you suppose office fighting
this is one of their little meeting
rooms and it's got a little computer
screen as a fire which makes it cute and
cozy I can have a sit
it's nice and here there are so many
different like cute little things that
they do I can't even remember to tell
you but as we were going around the
office the guy was telling us like
little traditions they have at a
Christmas party it but like an instant
smoothie bad people in the office and
like it's special we're like to sit desk
see jokes and it's your managers and
heart disease that move around and be
creative and it's just it seems like the
most amazing place to work so I think
we're going to do some knitting now and
I don't know if you don't know about the
big Nick campaign they've done it every
year for like 11 years something crazy
like that if you buy the smoothie that
has a little knitted hat on it they
donate money to a
helps keep the old people warm in the
winter it's really few idea I have in
this if we knew that Jojo is really good
so we're gonna mix some old hats now all
right listen it sometimes who's
struggling ok I've done like three loops
so far I'm not really good at this
judges helping me get mine started I'm
useless
all right Jane just on the first film a
tiny easiest minute you know it nearly
gave up the mind but I persevered I
really want so competitive I've ever
lasted like chatty and I'm like need to
do this
Miss Teen look I've done - yay - I mean
that's so good I'm distraught that I am
the worst version sales finish my life
I've given up my Carly's this good
Carly's as a whole I'm really happy
about that
enjoyed like racing to do this
so disappointed in myself jojo's
slightly cheated she's having a hat
finish your head just poked out from
this back there that does judges final
hats it looks a bit like tasty now and
I'm pretty sure I'm really better at
this than the knitting I like to vote
yeah or drinking or eating what's eating
and drinking going it's like no special
we have coats all right this is the
tasting room I'm all in our lab coats
ready all right we're going in teams -
I'm gonna see Ukraine best movie being
Holley on one team and then jammers the
nutritionist but not tasty yeah this is
very healthy very gross so let's make it
yeah I think we're gonna go for a
pineapple a mint theme because I like
the mix of finer elements and a bit
strong
what's your team name okay
do you go out and start juicing you have
two minutes
probably bit thicker you can't drink it
right we decided we're gonna use the
juicer if they're taking ages and we're
gonna make us more vegetable a anyway
all right we're gonna do some Apple Kiwi
spinach now we could add ginger no I
know my dreams are Jojo and Gemma's
looks like cement with me smell it you
know we're just gonna build a road it
smells a bit i cement - did you like did
you like your drink okay so we're gonna
go back to the blender pineapple pouring
Straub's additional obstacles
yeah yeah over the place yeah I know no
no I don't think it's ripe enough it's
the mint and the pineapple jam is gonna
save now you know you like yeah but I
bet it's full of sugar
oh Jesus went down had nice little green
specks in it from the min these are all
hats have you sent into the office but I
don't say did you have a nice time
cheerleaders so I'm back home now I've
been back for a few hours I was just
checking emails and catching up on life
and now I think we're gonna prepare some
food for tomorrow night this is the beef
oh it's really cold to split that whoa
stretchy dinosaur so this is the beef I
have no idea what we're gonna do with it
these people are gonna do it we're going
we're gonna smother it in mustard salt
pepper hmm yeah this is my brother than
all been by the way he hasn't been a
vlog miss yeah that it's yummy
I was working at home today right it's
good these are every vlog so far you've
said good productive I haven't done my
advent calendar today
where's five there you go I think that's
meant to be a turkey what we're cars in
the garage what happened to it it went
bump is the man fixing it yeah oh you
fixed it Wow look at you Oh Oh better
room room that can drive I don't know
what else the man gone okay so I think
I'm gonna start making this salad today
because apparently it tastes better on
the second day this is the quinoa salad
so this is all the stuff that I need
that has a lot of chemo right there so
I'm gonna measure everything I need and
be prepared I'm not very good at cooking
so let's hope I don't destroy this hey
Carly and Ben have gone to the
supermarket and left me alone with the
salad I think I might have to wait them
to come back I should not be trusted
alone
I've start so I prepare how much I need
of everything but now I need to cut the
pomegranate and god I have no idea I
think I heard Carly say you cut it in
half oh gosh and then you like bang the
seeds out this sounds like a disaster
but I'm gonna attempt to somehow
I've been banging for quite a while well
it's some have come out okay
so maybe if I take off his white stuff
and keep going it might be okay I'm
still banging but I'm getting quite a
few out now and I was if I like picking
apart helps and then banging it a bit
more I'm sure someone's gonna leave a
comment though with a really clever way
to do this that I'm not doing done I
have a bowl of pomegranate and I also
have pomegranate everywhere including on
me oh yeah there's some pomegranate on
my arm I feel like this is a cooking for
dummies tutorial now I'm going to peel
the carrot and coarsely grate it and
I'll probably do it wrong but I've come
to a problem it says peel the carrots
and then coarsely grate to them it's
meant to look like this see that there I
don't really understand because when I
use this they're coming out like really
thin and pathetic and that's not gonna
go in a salad but then this contraption
yeah there's all four white cheese
that's also cheese that me this is all
four cheese don't know what to use oh my
god if my sister and Ben come back and
I'm sitting here with these carrots not
knowing what to do they're literally
gonna laugh their heads off for me mom
what do you use to coarsely grate the
carrot for the salad I'm giving up in
the kitchen I've just done the carrots
and the wrong thing and now they're like
completely wrong sighs so I'm just gonna
edit today's vlog so far because I
haven't done any of that yet the weight
of Carly and Ben's come back and then
they can help me with the salad a tip
for anyone that has a MacBook Air they
don't have the little inserts on the
side for your memory cards so I got one
of these ages ago from Amazon and you
plug it in to the side it's a USB and
then it has a little slot for your
memory card to see you can import with
the footage so this is what the carrots
supposed to be like coarsely grated yeah
so mom said oh no that's the wrong size
I saw again she said get the grater so I
found the grater yeah and then I use
this one and then they ended up
so now I have three carrots and then I
tried this if she said try the big holes
yeah that made this that cat made this
which also did not look great salad we
just we just do this see now this is
what I can't cook blah okay that works
alright back to the salmon we've covered
it in this stuff which apparently from
Ikea they do the best gravel ax source
is it gravlax am I saying it right yeah
give the stock funny isn't everybody
Brevard looks yeah and I'm a pity some
dill on top those of dill and I'm gonna
wrap it again and then hopefully then we
slice it thinly or just get like tiny
bit of dill I actually really liked it
and I hate like most parsley type things
put all the ingredients in this bowl and
I've just wrote why I haven't roasted
some pine nuts clearly but I'm gonna
pull these in here and then we're just
doing the quinoa over here that should
be nearly ready sitting okay now I'm
gonna make these rookies and this blog
post is going up next week so it's a bit
of a spoiler but they are delicious
players have a salad looking so far but
we've decided to make double the amount
of quinoa you might do that later
tomorrow
there's quite a lot of edge if it tastes
delicious and the dressing is good too
this is Ben's super meat slicer how many
of you own one of those let's say that
person rich what you contributors what
are you wearing perfect laughing you've
couldn't you did nothing what are you
gonna do tomorrow what you bought your
error green

wine and you've forgotten the one thing
I asked it again starts with P and you
