hope you're all well today I'm going to
be doing my March beauty favorites and I
fallen in love with quite a few products
this month and the first product is from
the body shop it's new and it's called
the early harvest raspberry body scrub
and I don't think this is out yet I'm
going to put all the details in the
description bar below because I think
it's coming out next month it's
basically a really natural body scrub it
looks like raspberry jelly raspberry jam
and it has actual raspberry seeds in it
which is really good for exfoliating the
skin it doesn't leave any kind of oily
residue and it smells amazing so I
definitely recommend picking up some
stuff from their rods be ready when it
comes out I've also been obsessed with
pale lime green nails this month I have
a few polishes here I actually have
about six but these are three of my
favorites topshop Venus flytrap leighton
denny yes we can and deborah lippmann
spring buds which is for her new spring
collection and which is the one that I'm
wearing today I really like pale lime
green nails and I think it's really nice
for spring it's quite hard too much
clothes to wear it so when I have my
nails like this I'm always like Oh what
am I gonna wear the next few days keep
it simple but I think it's really pretty
and just something a little bit
different I've also been adding a few
new products my skincare routine and I
might do it updated skincare routine
video soon if you guys want me to but
I'm going to wait till I put everything
finalized so I've been trying quite a
few products recently but I found a
couple of products from arrange that I
really really like and the brown is good
estella until I think of who say it's
from Stockholm and I've got two products
from that raise I really like this is
the super bioactive firming day cream
and its really really nice it smells
like strawberry ice cream which it's
kind of weird and I had to get used to
it but it's it's nice does it smell
artificial it smells kind of naturally
sweet and it's one of those moisturizers
that once you stop rubbing it into a
skin it kind of gets even more like
white and moisturizing but then it
really sinks in and just really kind of
nourishes the skin so I loved using that
nice packaging good pump and everything
I also really like they're super
bioactive repairing oil complex and this
isn't
that I've been using in the evening it's
got a good packaging a little kind of
pet think that's what's good and it's
not too oily but it kind of sinks into
the skin well that just really nice to
put on either cinnamon which ties in the
evening or as a kind of serum before you
moisturizer I've been really loving
drugstore foundations this month I've
been trying loads of different ones I've
fallen back in love with border I happy
light and another one I really like is
l'oreal true match foundation and I
found out about this form Amelia her
channel is immunity Liana and she said
how this is a good deep for Armani
luminous silk which is foundation I
really like the first day they got was
ivory but it's a little bit too light
for me so I went back and get to get
vanilla which worked on its spike self
but these actually mixed together are
the perfect shade for me so I've been
mixing them on the back of my hand and
it really is just like luminous silk
it's not to do it's not really Julie at
all actually it's kind of like satiny it
just blends right into the skin really
easy ideas of buffing brush and it's
really good for filming and taking
photos it's not kind of a summary duly
foundation but it just makes your skin
look really good I'm wearing it today so
let me know if you think it looks good
now that it's coming up to spring and
summer I really wanted to try and find a
fake tan that I get with I try this
every year I never really find one that
i love but i wanted to give it another
go so i thought i'd tried this one which
is from zen tan and this is one that
were highly recommended from anna and
she's been using this for years so she
knows her stuff it's a really nice easy
to use lotion that i apply when i get
out of the shower i use a mitt and I
don't get a streak because I use a
mirror get it all over my hands and I
find that even on kind of the dry
patches or on my elbows and needs what I
tend to do is take a baby wipe or a face
wipe and rub it over those areas and
then there's no kind of patchiness or
streakiness there and the smells not too
bad it smells like caramel it's not too
biscuity and it lasted a good kind of
four or five days on me so doing this
once a week would be perfect for me
which I'm going to try and do as we go
more into the summer it's not cheap
so our 40 pounds but it's huge tube so
your knee using it once a week it should
last quite a long time if you watch my
videos and read my website you will know
that I've had really sore lips for
months now you probably haven't seen me
wear lipstick in a really long time I
don't know what it is I had allergy
reaction and it keeps coming back and
it's like we really dry lips and I feel
like the boy who cried wolf because I've
recommended quite a few lip balms over
the past few months that I said helped
me but they all ended up not working and
my lips were getting bad again so I
found one and I didn't want to mention
it to you guys until I really knew that
it's working but it is and it's the Lana
lips golden wheatland I was so desperate
my lips was so sore and I tried kind of
doctor cream I got from the doctors it
wasn't helping and this is on my desk
because I've been sent it and my mom
said just give that I go I really didn't
want to try anything else I was really
kind of skeptical about it all but I
tried this and it has been really
helping with my lips I'm wearing it now
so it does look a bit shiny it's not
like the best-looking bomb but it really
has been helping with my dry lips and
what it is it's basically it says it's a
super moisturizer at skin protectant for
extremely dry skin it doesn't even
really say that it's a lip balm since
that you can use on planes of your
elbows and your face it's just a really
really super moisturizing product and I
just thought I'd try some of my lips it
tastes a bit like cake which is kind of
weird but it's just been helping so much
of my lips every time they get dry and
flare up I put some of this on and they
just fill into the knee better and
they're definitely it's definitely
making a difference I have fallen in
love with a new conditioner this month
from a brand that I always talk about
and I love most of their products it's a
jean and is they're rare blend
moisture-rich cleansing conditioner now
this is part of a new kind of range for
them and they call it co washing so the
idea is that it's a cleansing
conditioner you use by itself instead of
shampoo like every other wash so you use
shampoo conditioner then you just use
this the new shampoo conditioner it's
good for people who have dry damaged
cause hair like me so you don't have to
use from stripping conditioners sorry
stripping shampoos a lot and keeps your
head feeling moisturised I tried this on
its own and I wasn't a huge fan I feel
like because I wash my hair like every
four or five days
it's quite greasy and I need to really
get that grease out but using it as a
conditioner after shampoo it is amazing
it makes my hair feels so soft and like
I saw my hairdresser he was so short he
said your hair is looking in such good
quality at the moment and good quality
or good condition so thing and I think
it's all down to this it makes my hair
feel so strong and soft and I absolutely
love it it's not she owns up to high and
Haier brand but i would definitely
repurchase this the final product is a
makeup bit and it's from Topshop and
it's a full / mascara I'm wearing this
at my past few videos and I've got loads
of comments when you guys say what masks
are you wearing your eyelashes look so
long and I really really like this I put
it in my Jeep's video as a good Jew to
the clinique mascara because it really
is it gives me such good length and
volume is super black and it doesn't run
on me I'd really really like this so
that's everything from my March
favorites I'm very proud of myself
because this is my fourth attendance and
I kept messing up so I feel massively
relief but confident of this video I
really hope you guys have enjoyed seeing
what my favorites are this month comment
below and let me know what your kind of
one ultimate favorite from the month has
been because I love finding new products
