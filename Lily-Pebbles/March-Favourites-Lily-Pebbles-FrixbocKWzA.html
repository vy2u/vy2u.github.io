really nice long easter bank holiday
weekend today is gonna be my March
favorites video and before I get started
I just wanted to let you know that I've
put all my March videos into a March
2016 playlist so if you feel like you
may have missed some of my videos this
month go check out that playlist because
it has all my videos from throughout
March I uploaded seven videos and my
favorite one I think was my Mother's Day
video so if you haven't watched that go
and check it out and some of the other
videos in the playlist if you're
wondering what lipstick I'm wearing it
is the Kat Von D everlasting lipstick in
lovesick and I mentioned this in my last
haul video I am seriously loving in it
so that's what that is
and now I'm gonna get started and talk
through my favourite products from the
month I have quite a big selection of
things not just beauty but lifestyle and
all the different bits and bobs because
I know you guys like that let's start
with a bit of beauty and I've really
been loving makeup setting sprays I feel
like I always love a makeup setting
spray but this month I've really been
enjoying the ones from Urban Decay this
is the one I use when I'm at home
because it's the full size and it's the
all nighter makeup setting spray so this
one is an oil free paraben free
temperature control technology that
makes your makeup last longer I also
feel like these sprays just kind of make
your makeup look less heavy on the skin
as well so this is the one I use when
I'm at home and then I also bought a
travel size when I was in the urban
decay store and this is their b6 so this
one's a vitamin infused complexion prep
spray it says it's from redness and pore
minimizing oil absorbing so you can use
this one before your makeup but I do
find with the Urban Decay sprays they're
all quite similar so this one I also use
over makeup and I keep it in my handbag
so I used throughout the day just to
like freshen up my makeup I've really
enjoyed using both of those sprays this
month and my second favorite is a hair
tool and these are new ghd's I haven't
changed my ghd's in years and they
really needed updating
she actually actually kindly gifted
these to me and I'm so in love with them
it's from the new Azula collection which
doesn't come out into the 4th of April
but I thought I would show you guys they
come in this really cute little kind of
case thing and I love these portable
cases because I travel a lot with my
straighteners and always fine like in
hotels
anyways put your straightness down and
you don't like burn a mark in the carpet
so these are really good this one opens
up so it opens flat if you use like a
heat-resistant mat but it also carries
your straighteners in there as well well
I also loved about the new straightness
as they come with this like protective
lid so it keeps the straightness closed
and also means that if your straightness
is still a little bit hot you can pack
them because I always really struggle
with that the last thing I do before I
leave my room is like straighten my hair
and then I always have to wait for the
straightness to cool down before I can
pack them so that pops off and then this
it what they look like I think they come
in a few colors
this is like the duochrome kind of bluey
greeny purple I think they're so pretty
I am obsessed with them they work so
well it's so nice to have a fresh pair
of straightness and if you guys have any
tips on keeping your straighteners clean
please let me know because I use so much
product in my hair
I find that my straightness get a little
bit grubby and I'm not sure the best way
of cleaning them so please let me know
if you have any tips also on the subject
of hair I've been loving a new dry
shampoo if you guys watched my Paris
vlogs you know that I did some work with
Wella this video isn't sponsored but I
did some sponsored work with them and
obviously tried out so many of their
products because of it and completely
fell in love with their dry shampoo so
this is from the IME range and it's the
dry me dry shampoo and I love this stuff
ironically even though it's been to
clean your hair I always feel like dry
shampoo makes my hair look a little bit
dirtier this one doesn't do that at all
it's great and it smells it smells
amazing it smells like mangoes like
fruity and delicious and it makes me
just want to like spray all over my hair
everyday it's so so good so I really
recommend that okay maybe let's throw in
some non Beauty now and I'll come back
to the beauty I thought I talked about
the book that I am currently reading you
guys might have seen this on my social
media it's called lean in and it's by
Sheryl Sandberg Sheryl Sandberg is the
CEO of Facebook and the book says on the
front women work and the will to lead
you guys know I've always had like a
really strong passion for women in
careers I've made so many videos about
it in the past and it's also a topic
that I feel like not so many of my close
friends are that passionate about so I
do feel like I kind of have to go
elsewhere
to get that fix and I saw this in
waterstones
it looked right up my street actually
and it's not too big it's not too
intimidating I don't have that much time
to read books oh I'm only half way
through this I'm quite a slow reader but
it's so so interesting it's basically a
book about her career path and how she
got to where she is the struggle she's
had along the way there's a strong
underlying feminist theme but it's not
intimidating I feel like feminism is one
of those topics that people feel like
they need to be completely clued up on
it before they can have an opinion and I
don't think that's the case at all I
think feminism is different for everyone
and I really like angle and the way she
talks about it in this book it's very
empowering you read this and you feel
like you want to go out and like kick
some butt so I'm really enjoying reading
it I don't want it to be over but I'm
kind of reading it every time I get on
the tube or have a bit of time at home
really enjoying this book the next one's
a bit random and I feel like I may have
mentioned this before in a video but WWN
rolled me it's a website where you type
in your email address and it brings up
all of the different websites that you
are subscribed to or the different
newsletters and you can easily just
unclick the ones you don't want to
subscribe to anymore I unclick I think
about 450 so that has massively saved my
inbox I hate getting a million different
newsletters from places I haven't even
subscribed to it's so quick and easy to
use and it just makes our everyday life
way less stressful this month I have
loved two foundations at the beginning
of the month I was completely obsessed
with the new Becca foundation I still
love this it's the aqua luminous
perfection foundation it's got really
funky packaging you basically shake it
twist it it pops up you press it and
then you twist it again and it's like
one of those pipette and it's a really
really nice glowy foundation it's light
to medium coverage you can kind of build
it up but I do you think it's got like a
bit more of a sheer finish than I'm used
to but so glowy and beautiful and I use
this for the first half of the month
before I went to Birmingham where I did
a bit of a map haul with Anna and I
ended up picking up the Mac Studio
sculpt foundation I've always been
intrigued by this I think mainly because
the packaging is just look so easy to
like carry around and travel with
because it's just a really lightweight
simple tube which I love and I think the
lady in the Mac
said this is their most glowy foundation
you guys know I like a good glow this is
in the shade NC 20 and I've been using
this with my Real Techniques complexion
sponge this month for the second half of
the month am i wearing it today no I'm
wearing the new YSL foundation today
which I'm testing but I have been loving
this and I've been wearing it in most of
my recent videos this one's a bit more
fuller coverage I'd say medium to fill
and you can definitely build it up but
it's easy to work with especially with a
damp sponge I really like this also in
the same Mac Hall I picked up a new
eyeliner and this is a new collection
for them I think it's an eye liner range
of cotton what it's called where the
eyeliners twist up so you don't need a
sharpener which is so life-saving I hate
having to sharpen my pencils it drives
me mad so it's called the modern twist
Kajal liner and this is in the shade
groundbreaker
which I tried in my hand and I think
it's very similar to Mac Teddy which is
an eye liner as you can see it's tiny I
have used this to death I'm going to do
a little cut away now and swatch these
side-by-side so you can compare but it's
basically teddy
without the faff of having to carry a
sharpener around with you and I love the
new packaging I've just been using this
on the top of my lash line and
underneath as well it's a brown but it's
slightly metallic bronze which I find
much easier to wear than like a really
solid dark brown that can look a little
bit harsh it means I can just put on
some soft brown eyeshadow and then use
the eyeliner to just smoke it out a bit
and I love it I also made an abaya and I
think she loves it too the next favorite
is another book this is a recipe book
it's Amelia freya cook nourish glow and
this is her new one amelia is a
nutritional therapist and number one
best-selling author I really like this
book there's 120 recipes inside I'm not
one of those people that loves the kind
of text a bit of a recipe book I never
really read that bit I don't know why
maybe it's because I already know what I
like I think if you're unsure about
cooking and sort of flavors that you
like there may be that kind of texty
nutrition bit as better for you but I
just love the recipes and I feel like
this is a really good balance of
vegetarian non-vegetarian healthy and
like a bit of indulgent as well there's
some really nice Asian salads in there
the gazpacho I made for lunch
you might have seen that on my snapchat
it was so easy to make and so
just really like healthy but still yummy
and I've really been enjoying working my
way through the recipes final favorite
was actually a photography course I went
on earlier in the month with Anna it was
a Jessup's photography course so he went
to the store not to the circus and it
was kind of like being back at school it
was from 10:00 in the morning till 4:00
in the afternoon and we took our cameras
with and it was a full-on course we did
level one which actually was quite
advanced I thought so I feel like these
days people know more about cameras than
they used to maybe because they're just
so much more accessible now so we
learned so much the course taught us all
about foundations of photography and
learning about lights and we learned
some practical skills as well and when I
learned about with our cameras took
photos kind of compared photos I learnt
so much about aperture and shutter speed
and then since then I've just been so
inspired to take so many photos I will
put on the screen now some of the photos
that I took the weekend after that
course I went to the south bank with my
family and I just loved testing out kind
of slow shutter speed and aperture and
just playing around my camera and taking
it off auto I think before I did the
course I thought that auto was just a
quick and easy way to use your camera I
didn't realize that there were all these
settings kind of either side of also
that you just can't get to if you don't
put it on manual and now I never use my
camera on auto when I'm taking photos so
that kind of brings me on to my next
favorite which is Disneyland Paris I
went last weekend with my family and we
had the best time it's just such a
magical place I really took myself out
of my comfort zone and went on some of
the scary rides which I absolutely loved
I can't believe it I always said as a
kid I won't go on anything that goes
backwards upside down I get motion
sickness and I kind of just went for it
this time and had so much fun
so I also practice my photo skills while
I was there and I will put some photos
on the screen now but I'm also doing a
blog post on this so I'm not sure if
it's gone up yet but there will be a
blog post with all the photos on there
and it was just so nice to take photos
there's so many photos of my family and
nieces and nephews that I won't be
putting it in the blog post but I feel
like I'm a family photographer now and
I'm loving it so yeah really happy to be
getting proper use out of my camera I
feel like people always buy expensive
cameras and they think like the better
camera they have the
photos of their health but I think if
you don't really know how to use your
tool there's no point in having it and
there's no point buying the most
expensive one though I'm happy to be
using it for what it actually does I
think that's it for all my favorites
