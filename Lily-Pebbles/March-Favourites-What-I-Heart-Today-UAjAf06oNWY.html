might have been mourning for you and
today I'm going to do my March favorites
the first one is the wire cell detained
to shoot plot foundation and the
beginning of the month I found that all
my foundations were getting really cakey
on my skin especially around my nose
area it was done to look like I was
wearing a lot of makeup and I just
couldn't get any of my foundations to
look right so I saw this one in my
drawer and thought I'll go back to this
because I used to really like it I don't
know where I stopped using it and I love
it again I've just fallen back in love
with it I use my hands to kind of work
this into the skin it's a real kind of
gel textured foundation and I love it it
never looks cakey it looks so natural is
so easy to apply and this is the perfect
color for mates be 40 and I have been
loving wearing this for the parcel of
two weeks I'm wearing it now i'm just
literally sticking to this one now for
the moment next favorite is a nail
polishes by deborah lippmann and it's
called fashion and it's just a nude
color everyone's kind of hidden in two
nudes at the moment all the brands of
bringing out colors I don't think this
is new actually I think this is really
an old one for her but it's the perfect
nude for me I've tried so many summer a
little bit too pink some of its you
Browns I'm a bit too kind of pale but
this is the perfect shade for me it's
just kind of matches my skin tone and
looks like mannequin nails and I really
like it i wasn't sure about the nude
nail thing until I tried this one and i
really like it now I think it looks
really chic and classy and simple works
with any outfit obviously so I really
like this deborah lippmann polishes
really good quality as well and I do
think they're worth the money next
product is for hair and it's the feet oh
I think it's free I never notice feet or
fight oh whatever feet 07 and it's a
hydrating day cream with seven plants
for dry hair so it's like a day creams
like a moisturizer but for your hair so
i use this in the morning after I've
kind of gone over my hair with
straighteners and it's looking a little
bit fluffy or static I put a tiny tiny
pea sized amount of this
and rub it to my hands and then just put
it through sort of the mid to end legs
and it just gives it a little bit more
texture makes it more moisturize it's
rid of any kind of fluffiness or static
and I really really like it i bought
this before I went on holiday for the
plane because Lisa Eldridge uses this on
the plane to hydrate her hair and I
think it's really good so I really handy
tube so you can carry it around with you
and it's an alternative to oils or
serums if you finally make your hair
greasy I think this is a really good one
doesn't make your hair feel greasy at
all the next favorite is a bit of a
random one and it's an Instagram I used
to go to school with the skull we were
best friends in school but unfortunately
we've kind of gone our separate ways
because she's moved to New York and I'm
still in London is my friend Julie heard
from school and she has an Instagram
page called beauty and some beef I'll
put the name below somewhere so that you
can go to go and check it but she's
basically started a food blog and which
is so great but hate Instagram page is
amazing and she just uploads the most
incredible food photos so if you like
looking at photos of food on Instagram
and you like have kind of food
inspiration I seriously recommend going
to follow her on Instagram because the
food that she makes is just incredible I
didn't even know that she could like
cook like that but me and my mother call
obsessed with it and we're always
checking her Instagram and they're
making the food that she puts up so i'll
put the link to an Instagram below you
should definitely go check her out the
next product is a lipstick and it's the
mac Ronnie read from the Archies
collection um I think I won't mention
this in a video and I thought a blog
post on it which I'll link below that
shows me wearing it but this was from
the artist collection which I wasn't
going to buy anything from but I ended
up getting Ronnie red which is a matte
red lipstick and I absolutely love it
i've been wearing it loads this month
it's kind of a raspberry deep red and i
just think it's so pretty and i got
loads of nice comments on the blog post
so thank you for that and yeah i think
this is a really nice shame i think it's
sold out now but hopefully they're kind
of bring it back in another collection
and then I have a few skincare products
as well the first one is from origins oh
of course and it's their new plant
scription SPF 25 moisturizer I've been
using this now instead of the make a
difference plus which I still I still
love that make a difference
it smells amazing it smells better than
this one but I feel like it's just kind
of moisturizer as well as this has an
SPF in it and its anti-aging so this is
new to the range has been added with the
cleanser and toner and stuff and I just
love it I've noticed such a difference
in texture of my skin my skin feels so
soft and it's nice to have boys resin
SPF because I need have to worry about
SPF in your foundations and yet i just
really like this and it's kind of a
thicker texture as well which I quite
like this is the oil free one there's a
normal one and an oil-free one but i
prefer the oil furry one I don't watch
different textures to go to a counter
and feel yourself to see which one you
prefer but yeah I'm going to try and
finish my make a difference plus but
then I'm sticking to this one because I
love it then I have two cleanses the
first one is from Clarins and I got this
word to Paris with Karen's it was in
like a little goodie bag so I don't
think it's the full-size I think it
normally comes in a tub if I'm correct
or something like that this is like a
mini size and it's the pure melt
cleansing gel with marula oil and I love
this it is more of a gel cleanser which
isn't something I'd normally go for I
think gel cleanses can be a little bit
drawing so i probably wouldn't recommend
it if you have really dry skin I've got
dehydrated skin and this works fine for
me I take a little kind of pea sized
amount it's like a gel rub it all over
my face makes a little bit of water with
it and then take off with a muslin cloth
and it takes up all my makeup and it's
just really nice to use a comma group if
it smells so I was quite fresh but not
like heavily scented at all I really
like this I've been really impressed
with it and then the second cleanser is
from elemental herbology which is a
brand you can buy in space NK and I've
used a couple of their products before
and really liked it and then I got a set
I did a blog post and so I'll link it
below but it's a set for 20 pounds where
you could try four or five of their mini
products and you get muslin cloth as
well I think it's a really good setting
by if you kind of want to try the brand
out this is the purifying see the facial
cleansing balm so this is a bomb a bit
like the Emma hardy that i use and and
but it's in a tube which makes life a
lot easier I really like it doesn't
smell nice it smells which the most kind
of
actual brands don't really smell nice
but it's such a good cleanser and it
just melts off all your makeup and makes
her skin feel amazing and moisturized
and nourished and I really really like
this when i finish this a little tube
i'm definitely going to buy the full
size and I need to find out actually how
price compares to mi hardly because they
are very similar but they both saw his
face in case that they're probably both
quite expensive and I tried out my mom's
sarah chapman cleansing balm and that
was incredible too so I just want to buy
all the cleansing bombs in space okay
but yeah I've been really impressed with
this as well and then the final favorite
is just having a little spring clean out
of my makeup I did a little rejigging in
my bedroom moved around some stuff and
sorted out my makeup storage just a
little bit more foils all in drawers
like hidden away and I just found that I
wasn't wearing a lot of stuff that I
wanted to so I went into Mooji of course
bought a little set of three drawers and
have put some of my makeup I want to
wear kind of every day in those so
they're just easy to grab for my mac
lipsticks at the top and then kind of my
eyes and my face stuff below it and then
I've sorted out all my kind of favorite
lipsticks into containers one of the
lipstick orders i got from the holding
company and then i also sorted out my
brushes into candle holders mainly dipti
candle holders but it all looks nice and
neat now and i'm happy and then all the
kind of bulk of makeup is still in draw
Bailey's all the stuff that I want to
use daily is out and clear acrylic
storage so yeah I'm really happy with
that so those are all my favorites from
march i hope you liked hearing about
them please subscribe to my channel and
and you can follow me on instagram as
well I've been getting variant Instagram
