March favorites video and I promise I
haven't tricked you with the title and
thumbnail I am going to be doing this
video with rich but I'm going to bring
him in for the second half of this video
because I have quite a lot of beauty
favorites to talk through and I thought
he's just sitting here like really bored
while I talk about my favorite concealer
it's just gonna be weird so I'm gonna
bring him in at the end and we're gonna
talk through some of our joint favorites
and some of his monthly favorites as
well so stay tuned to the end to see
that but I have lots of favourites to go
through this month so I'm gonna start
with hair because I've got quite a few
hair products that I've been absolutely
loving first of all the shampoo and
conditioner I've completely changed up
my shampoo and conditioner recently I
finally tried the bumble and bumble
Sunday shampoo this is the clarifying
shampoo so it's good for when you have
product build-up so in your hair feeling
really greasy which oh by the way
disclaimer my hair is so greasy today
it's Sunday because it's the only day I
can film with rich so my hair
desperately needs washing tonight and
it's tied up it looks ridiculous so
apologies there I would definitely be
using this tonight it's really good if
your hair feels like it never actually
gets clean after you wash it it just
feels greasy all the time so I use a
little bit of this I put off trying this
for a long time because I thought it
would be really drying on my already
very dry and frizzy hair but it's not at
all it's it's not drying it's just great
completely takes your hair back to
normal doesn't feel greasy and I've been
using that with the living proof
conditioner I do have the shampoo at
this as well but I've just been using
this this is a really nice conditioner
it's part of their frizz free range it
smells a bit like keratin treatment
which makes me think it has some kind of
straightening qualities in it it's a
space inkay brand I think it's current
by Jennifer Aniston actually oh I really
like this definitely worth the
investment for me I've also been using
the Sasha chuan I don't know how to
pronounce this it's the leave-in
conditioner I've had this in my bathroom
for years now and I just never got
around to try NYX I was using the United
74 cz from Hello October loves this so I
thought I'm gonna give it a go it's
really really nice I spray it into my
kind of damp hair brush it in it's a
leave-in conditioner so it really
nourishes the hair it makes it very soft
and shiny as well and makes it easier to
kind of to brush through so I really
like this as well I think it's a all
natural brand as well at some Stockholm
I may
I couldn't do my monthly favorites
without mentioning that Urban Decay
Naked skin concealer I won't talk too
much about it because I speak about it
in pretty much every video this has
taken over my nails concealer I
absolutely love it I love the applicator
it's very long and bendy and it sounds
awkward but it is and you only need like
one dick to do your whole face that's
really easy to use I use the shade and
light neutral there is a lighter shade
that I'd probably go for next time I
love this it's seventeen pound fifty as
well so compared to the NARS one which
is 22 pounds it is a little bit more
affordable I've been wearing more spring
type fragrances recently as we kind of
come out of winter finally and head into
spring and the two that I've been going
in between at both from German alone one
is wood sage and sea salt which I love
it smells like the seaside it's very
fresh it really reminds me of kind of
last summer when I went to Brighton with
rich Anna and Mark and it kind of brings
back good memories of that and also
German and Blackberry and Bay which is
very different than normal sense that I
wear it's quite sweet but again quite
the nostalgic smiles got blackberry in
there and it's just kind of a delicious
smell so I wear that on extra sunny days
the lipstick I'm wearing today is from
the new Chanel range and it's Coco I've
spoken about these a lot as well
recently I've really really been loving
them the three shades I love the most
are Arthur Coco and Adrian they are so
so super moisturizing agent is just the
best nude I used it in my monthly makeup
routine and I love it they're just very
easy to wear you can either pack them in
quite lightly or you can layer them up
and make more of a bold color cutter
color but they're very easy to wear very
moisturizing I really really recommend
them I've been keeping this in my
handbag for the past two months and I
really like it's from CR saying it's the
beautiful cuticles marula oil cuticle
care and it's just a little cuticle pen
because I find that my nails are so
flaky and dry and it's because the
actual nail beds are really dry so this
is just a little pen you wind up at the
bottom and it just has like some oil in
it and it's really I just like to put on
my cuticles when I'm bored or I'm on the
tube
whenever I remember really and it does
help really nourish my nails and stop
all the flaking and drying my next
favorite is a mascara I use this in my
monthly makeup routine as well it's from
Rimmel it's the extra 3d lash I just
don't pick this up on a whim when I was
in Boots recently and I do really like
it as I said in my makeup routine video
is very similar to Ben
roller lash it's got one of those
plastic brushes it's really good for
length not so much for volume but honors
some day like today I like to cut have
quite natural lashes but I still like
the length in scar separation in the
lashes this is really nice I really like
packaging randomly it's just a good
affordable mascara yet want to add to my
drugstore list ok one more favor for me
I have a couple others but I'm going to
do them with rich when he joins me in a
minute this is from Monika venado /
nadir I'm not sure how to pronounce it
it's a beautiful jewellery brand this is
a little box I have and it's a ring I've
had from her for a month or so now and I
really really like it you may have seen
me wearing it in videos it's a very
delicate little I think it's rose gold
it's got a little kind of moonstone I
really like how the ring sits and it's
just I mean I think this was like the
smallest size and it's still only fits
my middle finger I have such tiny
fingers of such a pain I really like
wearing it and my middle finger I think
it's very delicate very my style and
I've been absolutely loving this for the
past couple of months I keep forgetting
to mention it anyway I'm gonna keep that
ring on and I think I'm gonna bring rich
into the video now so let's see what
favorites he's been keeping a list on
his phone he's really into this video so
let's see what favorites he's been
loving recently okay rich is here now
and he's so tall that I can't hide my
frizzy hair with the top of the frame
anymore so now you just can't see my
full on Sunday frizzy hair that's one
day frizz yeah we feel we do the monthly
favorites together this year this year
this market because rich has quite a few
favorites he's in des Beauty there's
also lots of non Beauty favorites as
well so should we talk about the things
that we've both been liking okay about
them here oh yeah he's a shower products
that I thought they were mine but
they're very quickly becoming empty I
think there's a reason why you like this
is I don't you yeah okay so the first
one is the body shop smokey poppy shower
gel looks like this I really like this
why do you like it's black okay it's a
black shower gel how cool is that
yeah hmm I just really like this week
but it literally nearly finished
birthing using it do you like it yeah
well I like the smell and the smell
stays with me throughout the day it's
low-key masculine smell its views it's
morning right this is something else
it has got quite a masculine smell but I
think ladies will like it as well it's
just a good one there's no offering that
many body shop from as I like but we've
both be enjoying this I would actually
be purchased
yeah I'll get do they get bigger well
like the only problem I didn't like the
factor can I talk about this yeah that
it's really hard so I had to keep it
weird to hold it like that the whole
time yeah that's really annoying and so
it was really annoying to sort of get
everything and I think it's still bit in
there yes stupid packaging the next one
is some origins this is a new product
this is the clear improvement
detoxifying charcoal body scrub so you
know the clear improvement mark they
have this is for the shower so it's like
a black charcoal scrub and I bought this
home for you because yeah do you mind me
saying this rich sometimes gets like
spots on his back and have using a scrub
like this is really good for that
yeah yeah because when you work out and
do you work specially them out in the
winter time you're wearing like thermals
yeah and then you've got your bag on top
and it just like irritates my skin so
much yeah so all the sweat just buildup
stays there so this is actually really
good
why I like it keeps my skin moisturize
yeah really boy stur eyes not stripped
yeah it's not like like some type of
girl and I'm like stiff yeah come on the
products where this actually makes me
feel like I feel quite yes okay that's a
good one I think for girls and guys
let's have white your favorite after
shame because that like a little D call
it perfume fragrance no oh de parfum so
I got so was it the last this loss of
couple of months I've been sort of
trying to find well basically yeah ya
know by had or what I we purchased it
yeah I was going around everywhere
looking for it and like trying out new
ones and club wasn't sure I want to try
though so I got to understand a bit more
about her perfume and owed it with it
what's the difference that odor Toinette
it's just like stinks it's strong enough
is its weight its strong at to start
with and then it gets like then it just
goes and you feel water and you just
feel like you've just you know you go
into a club and you come out the toilet
and this braid all that crap on you you
feel like that okay so he's a fan of the
Eau de Parfum yes okay this is my
favorite at the moment
Chanel blue yeah be what you've won this
like every year but a couple years now
yeah so I've just got the big one it
smells really good invest
it's like I sent if you're looking for a
new scent pure boyfriend this is what
rich wears it's good because it's good
for during the day and in the evening as
well what's got and that's a magnetic
lid yeah and it lasts so I actually use
the smaller version which is what's this
is a hundred mils of 50 mils
yeah if you lost me for eight to eight
to twelve months really
jiminy to two sprays there yes strong
smell and they're there the key points
when you kiss people yes you got that
that and then they get the smell that's
the tree point or in the hair okay last
one okay right next
so this kills facial fuel SPF 15
energizing moisturize treatment for men
bang done you've gone through you like
three of these this is the third one
yeah it's bottomless this is I've had
this for about a year now and it's but
it's still going I don't want to waste
it it's still going I don't understand
it's like feeding of the 5,000 like you
thinking I may use it it's like keeps
coming out but I like it because I
sometime I get any in the afternoons I
get quite like an oily skin or like
quite don't you start to feel quite
greasy
yeah greasy but this when I use this it
doesn't really happen because one it
makes my skin feel quite nice and sort
not tight but like kind of rejuvenates a
bit in the mornings after I wash my face
or in the evenings but then also I don't
get that shiny face when I'm in the
afternoon you know yeah yeah that's
because I kind of told him it will
protect her skin when he's older yeah
add a tan or not I always though it's
just like helping give my time like some
cream yeah I know but it still has like
saw some no okay I think we've got some
non beauty stuff here as well now they
are my two core essential beauty things
babies here I thought this be handy for
any kind of boyfriends who will if you
some style tips so right so wait let's
explain first
rich has a big barman thighs like if
you're gonna like a body shape he's got
quite short legs it's got a long torso
it's got quite big bomb and thighs and
they've got muscly so it's quite hard to
find jeans and go through that
short legs bigger ass maybe it's true
that dreams are always like starlit
moments just super skinny and they never
fit they're like if they'll tie at the
bottom then let you tie it on yeah but
they're not a little waist as well it's
a wonderful way so the fact that you
found something that works is a miracle
yeah even me on weekend so these are so
these are the Uniqlo jeans and they are
slim fit silhouette tapered yeah they're
low-rise and you're 34 inch waist
yeah well of 33 oh it depends what gene
what brand it is Danny
but these are like nice and tapered at
the bottom so I can wear them like
trainers and shoes that's good also
they've got a better just like a nice
stretch yeah I can't feel like these
about those tights like jeggings but
they're not got a bit of stretch play
look and they come in different source
aids I'm so happy is finally found jeans
that fit and they're cheap as well
yeah they Archie they're like 25 25 quid
and they last me again a year because he
bought new tagines in the past
yeah but new jeans new deeply Wrangler
diesel and they just they go yeah within
six months
rip that's worth spending a bit less
that's how I feel that's Wonderboys yeah
okay favourite these are a bit dirty are
the Nike Free Runs 5.0 saw someone
amazing must have bought those for you
oh no I got this rich for his birthday
when I was in New York you may have seen
in my New York vlogs it's because they
kind of got like a nice thin sole but
not too thin not like that free running
saw stuff no yeah it's so light like
like better
they're just so comfy and I can wear
with like jeans and shorts if they look
quite smart cuz they're black yeah this
universal and it's so comfy I feel like
every time I wear them I thought I can
just balance yes I feel like I see on
cloud yeah and I told a couple of my
mates about these and then they got them
and they're like they came out to me
they're like bouncing their life yes you
do literally like feel like you're
balancing you're gonna bounce everywhere
you have like matching trainers we look
ridiculous
we can't imagine trainers okay next this
is more for the fitness lovers out there
which is really not me so because I do
quite well not recently but I do sort of
triathlon training and do triathlons and
some sports like that cycling running I
got this watch and it's the TomTom watch
and it's basically what number is TomTom
something but anyway you could there's
only like one version of this so you
know what it is and it's amazing I've
gone through a couple of different types
watches like Garmin's and this is just a
mint because it's got a heartbeat
monitor on it which I never really
believe in hot me the monitors unless
you're like an extreme professional
you're you know you need to understand
what level of heartrate you need to
train in but for day-to-day training and
just generally useful for like trifles
and running and cycling it's amazing
because it monitors your heart rate it
also it's got GPS instant like GPS and
it's really quick and it gap catches um
captures you straight it's just it's got
all the features it's so easy to do it's
just like a little screen you have on a
bike and it comes out of this as well it
literally it will just clip that on to
your bike or something yet so you buy a
locker so that's that's the cool thing
and you can buy the accessories for it
I'm guessing you can buy different
versions of these to make it if you
don't want red and white so my other
fitness thing is my roller which is
amazing Clips like this roll is the best
thing if you're struggling with
stretching or just anyway just get a
roller because it really gets them into
the knots it really so play how you use
X people who don't know what this is
what do you do with it okay so you'd
have it on the floor and say use on you
can use all on your body and then you
basically roll on your like car or so
you're not lying you're lie on it and
you just roll forwards on it and it just
literally like manipulates just like
Max's ideas yeah really good for
stretching and gets rid of those aches
it go through those knots its yeah it's
just really good cool last one it is
flat white sighs I love flat whites we
bought this in the coffee festival
yeah and it's called a keep cup and it's
just perfect for flat whites I use it
for work every day and tip up nice
little bit cafe in his office when you
take your
cup you get a discount and a lot of
coffee shops I think do that star but
some places so that's why he has his own
cup basically you get rid discount on
coffee yep yeah like a kid's cup okay so
there's all our monthly favorites I hope
you guys enjoy seen rich in this video
I'm hearing about with opponents that he
loves and let me know if your
boyfriend's or partners or ever got any
good tips from this see you in my next
video and thanks so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
