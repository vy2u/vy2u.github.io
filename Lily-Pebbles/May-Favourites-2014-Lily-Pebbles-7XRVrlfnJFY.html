doing my made favorites and yes I am in
Anna's bedroom sorry that's really
confusing I have a lot of makeup
favorites this month for some reason but
I'm gonna start with nails and these two
nail polishes are from Revlon and
parfumerie range I think it's called and
I didn't think I was gonna like this at
all I thought it was completely gimmicky
it's basically nail polish that has a
scent to it but I fallen in love with
these two shades this one is ginger
melon which is a nice kind of bright
summery pink and this one is apricot
nectar which is a soft peachy apricot
shade and I absolutely love these I just
absolutely love the shades but also they
smell really nice and it lasts a really
long time like I'd say four to five days
and you can just smell the fruitiness
even with a thick topcoat on top so it's
actually really nice I didn't really
think I would notice but I kept thinking
what's that smell it's really nice that
it was my nail polish so I'd really
recommend these two shades from the
range but they have so many different
shades so definitely worth checking out
keep it on a line with the drugstore
thing I've also been loving the Bourjois
Rouge Edition velvet and I was wearing
this one pink pom in my lipstick product
addict tag and I've really enjoyed
wearing both of these this red one is
called 0-3 does it have a name hot
pepper and I really like both of these
they're very matte and long-lasting easy
to apply they don't kind of dry out they
they're quite hard to remove you need
like an oily makeup remover to get them
off but that's good that just means
they're gonna last throughout the whole
evening these are the perfect drugstore
eternity for the hourglass lip lacquers
for skincare
I've been majorly getting back into the
Estee Lauder advanced and I repair and
this is the new one that they've
reformulated so it's called the
synchronized recovery complex - and this
is like the giant bottle I forgot how
much I love this because I ran out but I
got a new one and I've been using this
every evening so after I cleanse or put
any masks on I put the serum on before
my moisturizer and it just makes my skin
feel so moisturize and nourished and
it's just completely that cleared up my
skin it kind of does everything I just
actually love the stuff it feels really
nice on the skin as well it doesn't go
sticky at all I mentioned this lip balm
in my lip product addict tag which if
you haven't seen I will link it below I
can't pronounce it you all made fun of
the way
to say it's German it looked like this
and I just loved this I've already
spoken about it before but it's
definitely had to be included in my
monthly favourites because I've been
using it every day for blusher I've been
obsessed with the Clinique cheek pops I
think these are so nice again I thought
they were a bit gimmicky because the
packaging they look like little kind of
flowers and I thought oh these are going
to be like average cream blushes but
they're actually really amazing this
shade is berry pop and then this one
which is what peachy is called peach pop
and I like this because they're kind of
a cream formula but you can apply them
with a brush and they're really
long-lasting like they're really
pigmented it so has explain you'd need a
tiny bit on your brush and I find they
last all day even if you put a tiny
amount on I always feel like it's
normally the stronger brushes that lasts
but this can be subtle and long-lasting
at the same time I think they're really
nice they have a really nice selection
of shades and these are the two that
I've been wearing the most this month
now I talked about the bite area Umbra
black star a lot I have it in brown
perfection and I always talk about this
one it's just a great cream eyeshadow
but this month I've also been loving
misty rock which is actually one that
was recommended to me by Tanya burr
she uses this all over her lid and then
uses Mac hoax I think it's called in the
crease and I didn't have either of these
and like the combination that's amazing
in some of her videos so I went out to
buy them and I really liked them
whenever i swatched misty rock before on
my hand it always looked a little bit
too pink and glittery for me but when
it's on the lid is kind of like Mac all
the glitters but in a cream form and
it's so so pretty and then a hoax
is like a really nice kind of muted down
plum and this really kind of suits my
complexion I've been using this all over
the lid as well as some days I'm really
glad I can't leave I didn't even have
this and I hadn't didn't even really
know about it
so these together I've been loving and
just by Terry Umbra black stars in
general as still favorites of mine also
for eyes I've been loving Urban Decay
hustle eyeliner I know I always talk
about the makeup forever eyeliner in 2l
which is a really lovely brown but you
can't really get makeup forever in the
UK as easily so I've been loving using
this because I didn't want to finish my
makeup forever one and this is actually
really similar I think that urban decay
24/7 eyeliners are so long-lasting they
don't budge at all all day and they go
on really nice and creamy so you don't
like drying your eyelid and Hustle is
just really nice kind of easy brown
shade I talked about this foundation in
my beauty chat with Anna which I will
also link below if you haven't seen it
but I've been wearing this every single
day this month it's the rmk creamy
foundation I hate that it comes in pop
but the formula is too so amazing you
hardly need any product and it blends
beautifully over the skin it's kind of
full coverage but not at all cakey and
wearing it today I just feel like it
gives a really kind of flawless blurred
out skin I really like this it's just
really enjoyable to use I use my Real
Techniques buffing brush to buff it in
or my new Sephora brush which I will
talk about in my Sephora haul coming up
and I think it's a really great
foundation definitely worth trying so my
last favorite is a random one and it's
actually the Vampire Diaries
I have majorly been getting into the
Vampire Diaries if you watched on
Netflix I feel like when you watch
things on Netflix and you're not
watching it live on TV it's like I
become so obsessed I watched like nine
episodes in a row every night it's just
ridiculous I can't remember where I'm up
to I think I might be one like season
two or something like that I don't know
because it just kind of goes on the iPad
but I've become obsessed with it I was
really into Twilight I read all the
books and stuff it's weird because I
don't think of myself as like a vampire
kind of film person but I actually have
been loving the Vampire Diaries
I'm obsessed with Damon he has stolen my
heart and compelled me to love him so
there have been my may favorites I hope
you've enjoyed seeing the products that
I've been loving this month comment
below and let me know if we share any
favorites or what your favorites been
this month check back on Tuesday for a
Sephora haul I made a sneaky purchase
