old-school for today's video I'm just
sitting in my bedroom with completely
natural lighting but it's all this daily
vlogging has just made me feel a bit
uncomfortable with doing like proper
mane videos and lights I just feel like
I just want to sit and chat to you guys
and talk through my monthly favorites in
this kind of format so I hope you don't
mind it's very casual but I kind of like
it so I've got a list of all my
favorites right here next to me and I'm
just gonna run through all the products
and there's quite a few kind of fashion
and lifestyle bits as well that I've
been loving this month so let's do the
beauty stuff first
the most obvious one and I know you'll
all be expecting this is the new Mac lip
combo that I've been loving I showed it
in my monthly makeup routine video which
was last week Mac saw lip pencil with
Mac Mayer lipstick and someone commented
asking if you need both know you don't
Mac sort is lovely by itself and I'm
sure Mac Mayer is lovely by itself as
well you could use a lip brush if you
want to make it more defined around the
edges Mayr it's such a great lipstick
it's matte and it actually doesn't budge
a tool but the combo together I really
love and it's really long-lasting I mean
if you want us to last all day and all
night wear them together it's like a
really nice kind of movie pink and I
think it really flatters my skin tone
I've just loved wearing it it's a
different kind of look I used to just
kind of do natural or red this is
somewhere in between and I think it's
really nice for spring/summer another
lipstick I've been loving it's from
Lancome and this is shade number two one
two it's one of at least the Elders
favorites she told me herself and it's a
really nice kind of neutral color it's a
bit like Mac patisserie it's very easy
I feel like Mac patisserie although I
love it it is it isn't that sheer so it
is quite like opaque when you apply it
whereas this one's a bit more sheer so
you really don't need a mirror you can
just whack it on like every day so easy
and I really like the new packaging of
their lipsticks I think it's really chic
after meeting Lisa Eldridge in Paris I
know so she was wearing really bright
kind of orange red nails and she had a
green Chanel bag and I just thought it
was so chic it went so well it was so
nice to have like a bright pop of color
so I was completely inspired by that
I've been wearing this nail polish a lot
this month all the lids on backwards
this one is from the nails Inc Victoria
Beckham collection she did two shades
with them one was like a milky pinky
color and one was this bright orange red
which you can see here on the side and
this one is dieudo red I absolutely love
this
I think Chanel holiday which came out
like
years ago maybe it was a limited edition
if this is a bit like that but I really
like the quality of nails ink polishes
they don't chip on me the last really
well don't take today's nails as an
example they're so cheap but yeah this
nail polish shade is so beautiful I've
been loving wearing it and I love the
matte white packaging as well I gave you
guys a sneak peek of this one in my
monthly makeup routine and I said it was
going to be in my favorites and it
definitely is it's the Too Faced milk
chocolate bronzer
they sent me a load of their different
bronzes which I did a blog post on so I
will link that down below and I tried
them all out and this is by far my
favorite it's a matte bronzer so it
comes in milk chocolate dark chocolate I
think there's another one economy of
what it is but this is like the lightest
one so it's like a light brown and it's
slightly lighter then soap &amp;amp; Glory solar
powder so it's great if you want really
natural-looking bronzed skin it hasn't
got any shimmer in it which some people
prefer especially when it's sunny I
think too much shimmer can be a bit much
it's nice that it's matte which means
that you can contour with it it's just
such a great like all-around bronzer and
it smells like chocolate which is a bit
of a bonus really so definitely one to
look at today are wearing solar powder
because I wanted a bit more bronze but
I've been using this everyday I've also
been enjoying Estee Lauder revitalizing
supreme CC cream now this is slightly
different from some other CC creams it's
a bit like the origins vitae Singh I
think it's called it comes out great and
then when you start rubbing it into the
skin it turns skin color this is
slightly darker than my natural skin
colour so I've been using this on days
were on it when I want to look a little
bit more bronzed I either mix it in with
another tinted moisturizer or I just
wear it as a base today I put it on as a
base and then applied the Burberry BB
cream over the top it wouldn't work if
you are really pale because it is a bit
dark I think but it's just such a nice
base it's just gives you a really glowy
skin I don't know what it is but this
just adds that glow that I've been
craving this month and it's just a
really nice step in my makeup routine
the last kind of beauty product
favourite is from Oscar this has been in
my skincare shelf for a couple of months
now it's the get up and glow I got this
from cult beauty and I really like it I
was so intrigued because it's a serum
that has this like Euro chrome effect
and I want to see if that translates
onto the skin and it really does as soon
as you put it on I use like one and a
half to two pumps my skin just looks so
much more glowy and it's not as
hydrating as
the Sarah Chapman intense hydrating
booster serum so my days on my skin's
really dry I'll use that serum but if I
want to glow then this one is really
good it's ashame it comes in a glass
bottle because it's not great for
traveling but I've used quite a lot
already and I really like this okay this
is still kind of beauty if you watch the
video I did with my friend Keisha on
hair removal that was the first time I
tried epilating and I am in complete
convert I'm obsessed with it now I got
my hands on the Vaughan silk
apple 9 it's in this little bag this is
their most like advanced epilator I have
the basic one which is the one I used in
that video and that one is really good
but I like this one because it's
Wireless you don't have to use it when
it's plugged in and it's quite hard to
find like a shaver socket and I even get
adapters but it's nice to have the
option to use it Wireless epilating if
you don't know is basically like
plucking this thing I'll turn on now it
turns really fast and it plucks all the
hairs so growth is slower your hair
doesn't grow back as quickly like I did
my legs before beautycon on the weekend
and they haven't really grown back here
which is amazing because when I shaved I
would have to do it every single day so
this has like changed my life it does
hurt but I promise off the first time it
doesn't hurt as much you really do get
used to it people don't just say that is
true I've been using it on my legs arms
I tried on my underarms but I do get
laser so I probably shouldn't be doing
that it's just really really great and I
like the Sun because as I said it's
wireless it kind of bends more so when
you're doing your knees and tricky areas
it's much easier to use and this one
came with a removable head as well so
this is like a little head that it
doesn't spin but it like vibrates and I
found using this for tanning really good
just like slowly ating your knees and
elbows before you tan so yeah I'm
converted I did a blog post on epilating
so I will link that down below and it's
amazing definitely try it don't be
scared my next favorite is from H&amp;amp;M home
I went there maybe a month or so ago and
I picked up these two marble pieces
marbles very much back in it's real like
on-trend thing at the moment but I think
mob was really smart and I got these
well I'll show you so the first one is
this and i think is actually a cheese
plate but i don't really need a cheese
plate but i've been using this to take
blog photos on and it's a really nice
little size it's easy to store and it's
just like a little marble plate and it's
kind of keyed you can put your jewelry
on it or
whatever you want really you put on your
bedside table and I also got the little
cup to go with it to put my makeup
brushes in and I think that's so smart
there's quite a few like marble DIYs on
YouTube I think so if you want to do it
yourself I'm sure you can but these are
pretty affordable from H&amp;amp;M next up is my
bag this is from brandy melville and I
absolutely love this I was looking
everywhere for a fringed bag a lot of
them coming brown like in tan because
that's kind of in with the whole
seventies theme but I love this one is
black it's got kind of bronzy gold and
hardware I think it was 35 pounds which
is quite affordable it has a zip that
does up and then it's got like two kind
of tassels it's a really nice size for
everyday I've been wearing it so much or
its beautycon I've been wearing it like
all the time I just love that whole like
fringing thing I think it's really cool
and I'm so glad I found that bag and
finally my last favorite is a podcast
called ear biscuit if you watch my vlogs
you'll know that I've been listening to
them and it's basically in-depth
personal interviews with really
well-known youtubers so I've listened to
Tyler Oakley's Troye Sivan Miranda sings
Hannah Hart mamrie and grace Helbig and
it's really interesting because they
talk about things that they don't
usually talk about in their videos and
their family their personal life how
they got into YouTube and it's so
interesting it really makes you realize
that youtubers aren't people who just
kind of put up a camera in their bedroom
but they've got backgrounds they put
history there were stories and I love it
I just listened to it on the tube it's
really nice to like have no screen time
and not be looking at Instagram or
Twitter but just kind of sitting and
listening I feel like it's a really good
brain exercise so I've been loving
listening to those so I think that's
everything for my may favorites and
every day may is over now it's finished
which is really quite sad but I think
I'm gonna change up my video scheduling
a little bit I'm gonna keep Tuesdays at
6:30 p.m. Thursdays at 6:30 p.m. and
Sundays at 9:30 a.m. so that's all gonna
stay the same but I might start doing
more than one vlog a week maybe two and
I'm just in general gonna try and make
my videos a bit more casual and personal
I like challenging myself and being able
to do creative videos but I want to try
and stay clear of just sitting in front
of a camera and talking like this if you
know what I mean because I feel like you
guys prefer the more personal
doggystyle so I'm going to try and
incorporate in that into my main videos
as much as I can and I'm sure I will do
daily vlogging again at some point I
don't know when but I will be sure to
let you guys know probably the next time
I come up with a fancy name I'll be like
go do it now like everyday May I hope
you've had a really good month and yeah
bring on June thanks for watching guys I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
