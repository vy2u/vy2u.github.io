school for today's video I'm just
sitting in my bedroom with completely
natural lighting but it's all this daily
vlogging has just made me feel a bit
uncomfortable with doing like proper
main videos and lights I just feel like
I just want to sit and chat to you guys
and talk through my monthly favorites in
this kind of format so i hope you don't
mind it's very casual but I kind of like
it so I've got a list of all my
favorites right here next to me and I'm
just going to run through all the
products and there's quite a few kind of
fashion and lifestyle a bits as well
that I've been loving this month so
let's do the beauty stuff first the most
obvious one and I know you all be
expecting this is the new mac lip combo
that I've been loving I showed it in my
monthly makeup routine video which was
last week Mac saw lip pencil with Mac
mayor lipstick and someone commented
asking if you need both know you don't
Mac sort is lovely by itself and I'm
sure Mac mere is lovely by itself as
well you could use a lip brush if you
want to make it more defined around the
edges mayor is such a great lipstick
it's matt and it actually doesn't budge
a tool but the combo together i really
love and it's really long-lasting i mean
if you want us to last all day and all
night wear them together it's like a
really nice kind of movie pink and i
think it really flatters my skin tone
I've just loved wearing it it's a
different kind of look I used to just
kind of do natural or red this is
somewhere in between and I think it's
really nice for spring/summer another
lipstick I've been loving it's from
Lancome and this is shade number 212
it's one of at least the elders
favorites she told me herself and it's a
really nice kind of neutral color it's a
bit like Mac patisserie it's very easy I
feel like Mac patisserie although I love
it it is it isn't that sheer so it is
quite like opaque when you apply it
whereas this one's a bit more sheer so
you really don't need a mirror you can
just whack it on like every day so easy
and I really like the new packaging of
their lipsticks I think it's really chic
after meeting lisa eldridge in Paris I
know so she was wearing really bright
kind of orange red nails she had a green
Chanel bag and I just thought it was so
chic it went so well it was so nice to
have like a bright pop of color so I was
completely inspired by that I've been
wearing this nail polish a lot this
month all the lids on backwards this one
is from the nails inc Victoria Beckham
collection she did two shades with them
one was like a milky pinky color and one
was this bright orange red which you can
see here on the side and this one is
judo red I absolutely love this I think
Chanel holiday which came out
years ago maybe it was a limited edition
this is a bit like that but I really
like the quality of nails inc polishes
they don't chip on me the last really
well don't take today's nails as an
example they're so cheap but yeah this
nail polish shade is so beautiful i've
been loving wearing it and i love the
map white packaging as well i gave you
guys a sneak peek of this one in my
monthly makeup routine and i said it was
going to be in my favorites it
definitely is is the two-faced milk
chocolate bronzer they sent me a load of
their different bronzes which i did a
blog post on so i will link that down
below and i tried them all out and this
is by far my favorite it's a matte
bronzer so it comes in milk chocolate
dark chocolate i think there's another
one I can't remove all it is but this is
like the lightest one so it's like a
light brown and it slightly lighter then
soap &amp;amp; Glory solar powder so it's great
if you want really natural-looking
bronze skin it hasn't got any shimmer in
it which some people prefer I'm
especially when it's sunny I think too
much shimmer can be a bit much it's nice
that it's matt which means that you can
contour with it it's just such a great
like all round bronzer and it smells
like chocolate which is a bit of a bonus
really so definitely one to look at
today i'm wearing solar powered because
i wanted a bit more bronze but i've been
using this every day I've also been
enjoying estee lauder revitalizing
supreme CC cream now this is slightly
different from some other CC creams it's
a bit like the origins vitae singh i
think it's called it comes out great and
then when you start rubbing it into the
skin it turns skin color this is
slightly darker than my natural skin
color so i've been using this on days
were on it when I want to look a little
bit more bronzed I either mix it in with
another tinted moisturizer or I just
wear it as a base today I put on as a
base and then applied the burberry BB
cream over the top it wouldn't work if
you are really pale because it is a bit
dark I think but it's just such a nice
base it's just gives you really glowy
skin I don't know what it is but this
just adds that glow that I've been
craving this month and it's just a
really nice step in my makeup routine
the last kind of beauty product favorite
is from Oscar this has been in my
skincare shelf for a couple of months
now it's the get up and glow I got this
from colt beauty and I really like it I
was so intrigued because it's a searin
that had this like euro chrome effect
and I want to see if that translates
onto the skin and it really does as soon
as you put it on I use like one and a
half to two pumps my skin just looks so
much more glowy and it's not as
hydrating as
the sarah chapman intense hydrating
booster serum so my days on my skin is
really dry i'll use that serum but if i
want to glow then this one is really
good it's shame it comes in a glass
bottle because it's not great for
traveling but I've used quite a lot
already and I really like this ok this
is still kind of beauty if you watch the
video i did with my friend Keshia on
hair removal that was the first time i
tried epilating and I'm in complete
convert I'm obsessed with it now I got
my hands on the wrong silk epil 9 it's
in this little bag this is their most
like advanced epilator I have the basic
one which is the one I used in that
video and that one is really good but I
like this one because it's wireless you
don't have to use it when it's plugged
in and it's quite hard to find like a
shaver socket and I even get adapters
but it's nice to have the option to use
it Wireless epilating if you don't know
is basically like plucking this thing
I'll turn on now hmm it turns really
fast and it plucks all the hairs so
growth is slower your hair doesn't grow
back as quickly like i did my legs
before beautycon on the weekend and they
haven't really grown back here which is
amazing because when i shaved i would
have to do it every single day so this
has like changed my life it does hurt
but I promise off the first time it
doesn't hurt as much you really do get
used to it people don't just say that is
true I've been using it on my legs arms
I tried on my underarms but i do get
laser so probably shouldn't be doing
that it's just really really great and I
like the Sun because as I said it's
wireless it kind of bends more so when
you're doing your knees and tricky areas
it's much easier to use and this one
came with a removable head as well so
this is like a little head that it
doesn't spin but it like vibrates and I
found using this for tanning really good
just likes foliated your knees and
elbows before you tan so yeah I'm
converted I did a blog post on epilating
so I will link that down below and it's
amazing definitely try it and don't be
scared my next favorite is from hmm home
I went there maybe a month or so ago and
I picked up these two marble pieces
marbles very much back in it's real like
on trend thing at the moment but I think
mob was really smart and I got these
well I'll show you so the first one is
this and I think is actually a cheese
plate but I don't really need a cheese
plate but I've been using this to take
blog photos on and it's a really nice
little sighs it's easy to store and it's
just like a little marble plate and it's
kind of cute you can put your jewelry on
a tour
whatever you want really you put on your
bedside table and I also got the little
cup to go with it to put my makeup
brushes in I think that's so smart
there's quite a few like marble DIYs on
youtube I think so if you want to do it
yourself i'm sure you can but these are
pretty affordable from H&amp;amp;M next up is my
bag this is from brandy melville and i
absolutely love this i was looking
everywhere for a fringe bag a lot of
them coming brown like in tan because
that's kind of in with the whole 70s
theme but i love this one is black it's
got kind of bronzy gold and hardware I
think it was 35 pounds which is quite
affordable it has a zip that does up and
then it's got like to kind of tassels
it's a really nice size for every day
I've been wearing it so much or its
beauty corn I've been wearing it like
all the time I just love that whole like
fringing thing I think it's really cool
I'm so glad I found that bag and finally
my last favorite is a podcast called air
biscuit if you watch my vlogs you'll
know that I've been listening to them
and it's basically in-depth personal
interviews with really well-known
youtubers so I've listened to tyler
oakley's choice of on Miranda sings
Hannah Hart maimry and grace Helbig and
it's really interesting because they
talk about things that they don't
usually talk about their videos and
their family their personal life how
they got into YouTube and it's so
interesting it really makes you realize
that youtubers aren't people who just
kind of put up a camera in their bedroom
but they've got backgrounds they put
history there were stories and i love it
i just listened to on the tube it's
really nice to like have no screen time
and not be looking at instagram or
twitter but just kind of sitting and
listening i feel like it's a really good
brain exercise so i've been loving
listening to those so i think that's
everything for my may favorites and
every day may is over now it's finished
which is really quite sad but i think
i'm going to change up my video
scheduling a little bit i'm going to
keep tuesdays at 630pm thursdays at
six-thirty p.m. and sundays at
nine-thirty am so that's all going to
stay the same but i might start doing
more than one vlog a week maybe two and
i'm just in general going to try and
make my videos a bit more casual and
personal I like challenging myself and
being able to do creative videos but I
want to try and stay clear of just
sitting in front of a camera and talking
like this if you know what I mean
because I feel like you guys prefer the
more personal
be style so I'm going to try and
incorporate in that into my main videos
as much as I can and I'm sure I will do
daily vlogging again at some point I
don't know when but I will be sure to
let you guys know probably the next time
I come up with a fancy name I'll be like
go do it now like every day may I hope
you've had a really good month and yeah
bring on june thanks for watching guys I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
