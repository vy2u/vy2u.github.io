me to do daily videos and feedback is so
important so please do leave me a
comment and let me know anything to do
every day may any sort of feedback is
great I haven't really decided what I'm
gonna do going forward whether I'm gonna
stick to the old schedule of like
Tuesdays and Sundays or just like mix it
up a bit I don't really know I felt like
the world is my oyster so let me know
what you would like to see and when you
like to see videos and anything like
that now is your time to speak up
so today I'm gonna be talking you
through some of my favorite products
from the month and usually I kind of
take notes throughout the month but I've
been so busy that's not seeing stuff
that I really haven't had time so I just
kind of ran around picked up things that
I feel like I've been using it a lot
this month so this is a very spontaneous
favorites video I'm gonna start with
this new range from the body shop
because I've been talking about it so
much on like snapchat and Instagram and
everywhere really I absolutely love it
it's the Pina Colada range
I am absolutely obsessed the smell is
incredible
it literally smells like having a
cocktail by the pool on holiday in the
Caribbean and it makes me so happy when
I use in the shower the scrub is
actually really good especially as part
of my tanning routine and then the
shower gel I've literally been using
everyday I've already gone down to there
I have backups I don't know this is a
limited edition range or if it's gonna
be permanent but I would say stock up in
case because it's so so good talking
about tanning there are a couple of fake
tans I have been really enjoying
recently this one you already know
because I talked about it in my spring
skin what did I call it how to spring
ready skin I know is a bit of a
confusing time so I didn't want to call
it tanning routines I know that puts
some people off but I did talk through
my tanning routine in the video and I
talked about the Bondi sands liquid gold
I really like this it's a dry oil and
this is the one I use when I'm in a rush
so I'll just have a shower exfoliate
spray this on rub it all in and that's
it I'm good to go
and it's a really really nice tan I've
also been trying out this on from Vita
Liberata which is the phenomenal I was
recommended this but I'm not sure if it
was the
loschen I was supposed to get all the
moose I didn't really check to see I
didn't know there was two different ones
so I got the lotion and I find this
formula a bit harder to apply than a
moose so I'm gonna check if they do a
moose in the phenomenal and if they do
I'll probably buy that but the town
itself leaves a really really nice
natural like olive town I go like a nice
olive color when I tan naturally so this
suits me perfectly this is sort of one
you have to put on and then wash off so
I apply at night and then wash off the
next day I did two applications two days
in a row and it left a really nice tan
so I've been enjoying using that one as
well I had so many questions and
compliments on my eyelashes this month
from you guys from friends from Family
and this is the mascara I've been
wearing all month I used it in a recent
tutorial so I will link that if you want
to go have a watch and see it in action
it's the Charlotte Tilbury legendary
lashes it's so so good I didn't like
Charlotte Tilbury the original mascara
it really ran on me this one doesn't
sometimes when I apply it in the morning
I might get a little bit here but I just
want but often it goes but it gives me
seriously huge voluminous lashes with
this very waterproof if your mascara
does normally kind of run then maybe
this one might not be for you but on me
it's absolutely fine it lasts all day
and just gives a massive curl and like
lift and volume to my lashes I think
it's an incredible mascara alright let's
break away from beauty for a moment and
talk about this book this is Leon and
John's new book if you guys don't know
Leon and John they're friends of mine
they are the lean machines on YouTube
they're two of the nicest guys on
YouTube seriously nice guys they're both
personal trainers and fitness sea
enthusiasts they pull out a book it's
called eat well move better and feel
awesome they're both very positive
lovely guys and this book is so so good
it's filled with like life advice or I
put a little message for me in the front
for me and rich it's filled with like
life advice and nutritional tips it's
got some exercises in there as well well
I really love about this book the
recipes and I didn't really expect that
actually I'm not sure why I like I knew
that Leon and John are amazing at their
fitness II stuff but I hadn't really
thought about it in recipe side of
things but these recipes are so so good
they're like simple enough that it's not
over complicated it's just good food and
I've really been enjoying working my way
through this so much so that leo
it's got some kind of crusty thing
coming up from his head I think that's a
bit of onion shows that I've really been
using the book I mentioned these in a
whole video and they are the ESOP post
Poudre ops you put a few of these in the
toilet after you have done something
smelly and they seriously get rid of the
smell I mean slightly embarrassing that
you can see how much me enriched have
used since I last showed this in a video
but seriously this gets rid of any smell
and they're so good I think they're so
funny and these nice to have them in
your bathroom especially when guests
come around you literally just drop a
few in and the smell is gone genius the
lipstick I am wearing today is one of
the Urban Decay vice lipsticks it's in
the shade rush which is the one that I
wore on the photo shoot I did with them
in New York they picked the shade for me
and I think they picked perfectly it's a
very me shade and I've really been
enjoying these lipsticks this month
they're launching a hundred shades and
different finishes and the three colors
I've been wearing a lot this month a
rush which some wearing now naked which
is a bit more of a soft soft and nudey
pink and then liar which is even more of
a nude and these are all very wearable
shades I just love the formula of these
lipsticks I've tried the matte ones I've
tried the creamy ones they're all very
comfortable and long-lasting and I think
it's a really exciting launch to them
I've been looking for a new eye cream
I'm so rubbish to apply an eye cream I
always forget it's just that step that I
can't be bothered to do and I rarely see
like instant results so I always just
kind of forget about it but then I
really want to start using eye cream
again because I'm definitely starting to
get a little bit wrinkly around my eye
area and definitely quite dry and I
really recommended this one to me so I
thought I'd give it a go is that Estee
Lauder revitalizing supreme and I really
like this and I like it because I could
see instant results it's a very thick
cream so it's really hydrating and it's
nice to use in the evening it feels a
little bit like an eye mask but it's
also nice to use it in the morning
because it's really hydrating under your
concealer I can see what all the fuss is
about now it's it's really nice I cream
I like that it's creamy
sometimes the gel ones are just a little
bit too slippy for me so you only need a
tiny amount I just put it along the
orbital bone a little bit under my brow
and it's a lovely eye cream it's not
cheap but it's good I just have a few
more makeup bits first of all is a nail
polish from Chanel I was on the trip
when I went to France with Chanel a lot
of you guys were asking what I was
wearing it's from their new polish range
so they
reformulated their nail polishes they're
much longer lasting now it's a much
better formula and this is espadrilles
it's like a bright orange I think it's a
perfect summer shade I'm not wearing it
now my nails actually really need doing
they're so chipped I just haven't had
any time but I really love this Chanel
shade it's very chic and very flattering
next up it's a foundation this is from
Tarte I bought this when I was in New
York
it's the rainforest of the sea water
foundation I've talked about this before
in videos I don't love the applicator it
gets really messy on the back of my hand
but I really love the formula of this
I've been using it with a damp Beauty
Blender and it's just a really natural
but good enough coverage that you still
feel like you're wearing enough makeup
but it really doesn't make me feel like
I'm wearing a cakey foundation at all so
I've been enjoying using this every day
I would definitely recommend trying it
if you can and then finally this palette
from Anastasia the glow kits I still
love my Becca champagne pop but these
highlighters show up like nothing else
you really only need a tiny amount I
just pop a little bit on my cheekbones
and it really shows up which I love
you can definitely go overboard I try
not to it's a shame that the shades
aren't more kind of golden I know these
look quite golden but I kind of like
something in between these two this was
a little bit too pink these two are both
a little bit too dark brown for me and
that one's a little bit too icy I wish I
could make like my perfect highlighter
but I do mix these together the formula
is just like nothing else
I don't know how they've got the formula
so right this is a really good palette
definitely worth picking up there's all
my favorites I kind of whiz through
those I saw if I've been a little bit
off in this video it's 5 o'clock and I
don't normally film videos at 5 p.m. I
normally film like 11 a.m. so I just
feel like I'm in a bit of a weird like
afternoon mood but I wanted to get this
video film so it could be up on Sunday
morning for you guys and I hope you
enjoyed hearing my favorites of the
month have been please don't forget to
give me some feedback on everyday May
and how often you want me to upload
videos whether you like more kind of
thought through bigger sit-down videos
or if you prefer more like on-the-go
vlog e whatever I don't know feel like
I'm having a YouTube midlife crisis that
I want to rethink things a little bit so
I want to hear from you guys please let
me know thank you so much for watching
and I'll see
guys in my next video by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
