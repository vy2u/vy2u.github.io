favorites video and I haven't got that
many things this month compared to
normal i'm going to start with a couple
of makeup bits and the first one is a
foundation that i've fallen back in love
with and it's an old favorite is the
chanel vitalumiere aqua and i used to
love this foundation I've hardly got any
left which is why I've gone back to
using X I thought I'd better use it up
and I've just fallen back in love with
it it's a really nice foundation it's
basically one of the ones you have to
shake up and I'll use my hands to apply
it and I just think it works into the
skin so well and it leaves a kind of
it's not too glowy it's kind of velvety
it's really hard to describe it's got
SPF 15 in it I just think this is
definitely one of my top five
foundations I absolutely love it and see
you live nearly finished I might have to
repurchase another one soon but yeah
I've been loving using this at the
moment another make up for I've been
loving is the steeler convertible color
in gboro and this is a cheek and lip
cream so you can use it as a blusher or
as a lip balm and gerbera is a really
nice peachy color it's quite orangie but
I really really like this my mom used to
use these a lot I remember I think she
has peony which is a really pretty pink
so I picked this one up recently and
I've really enjoyed using it I use my
fingers to apply it because it's quite a
sticky cream blush it's not like one of
the ones that kind of goes cream to
powder it's very sticky and creamy which
I like because it means it sticks around
for longer so I've mainly been using
this on my cheeks but it is nice on the
lips as well I just prefer for this kind
of color isn't a very lip color for me
so I've easing up on my cheeks and its
really really nice and really good
everyday color for blush as well my next
favorite is Amelia Liana she recently
joined YouTube and I'm so happy she's a
really good friend and definitely one of
my favorite beauty bloggers and if you
didn't see my 100th video she featured
in that and after that we kind of
started a petition to get her in YouTube
kind of as a joke but then she actually
did so I'm so happy she's such a natural
in front of the camera and she has
really great beauty tips so if you
haven't yet seen her new channel she's
uploading quite regularly because she's
just started so it's really exciting and
i'll leave the link to her channel below
so you can go and check out her videos
they're really really good if you follow
me on instagram you will know that a
favorite of mine this month is
for me being the a beautiful mess app
I'm sure you would have noticed if you
follow your needs to go I've been
driving everyone mad with the images but
beautiful mess is a blog I love reading
and I have done for quite a while and
they've just created their own photo app
it looks like this and it basically
means you can edit photos you can put a
nice text on it you can put nice borders
and I've just had so much fun playing
around with it and I love Instagram I
love editing photos I love anything like
that so I've really enjoyed kind of
putting up pretty pictures using the app
and it wasn't free but it was like 69 p
which is absolutely nothing so I'm so
happy to play for that and yeah it's
really fun next up is a product for the
bath and it's the himalayan detox salts
by therapy by Rocco Neal and I love
these things I had a sample size which
was kind of two baths worth and I end up
getting the full size because I love
them they're just bath salts they look
like this they're kind of pink they
smell kind of weird actually I don't
really love this nah they don't make
your bath pretty color they don't really
make your bath smell that much but they
are seriously amazing they make me have
the best night sleep ever they make me
feel so calm and detox and relax and I
can't even explain their like magic so I
definitely recommend trying these they
do sell for sizes if you just want to
give it a go because they're not cheap
but this so good she's a really famous
aromatherapist that my parents actually
used to use back in the days I've
absolutely loved using these recently
and they've really been helping me get
to sleep because my brain kind of goes
crazy at night and I find it really hard
to switch off so I've been loving these
I've got quite a few kind of shower
products and the next one is the Nivea
in-shower body milk skin conditioner
which is like a huge bottle I really
like this I don't really use much stuff
from Nivea but this is basically one of
those products that when you're finished
washing your hair doing whatever you're
doing in the shower this is the last
thing you do it's kind of like a thick
milk and you put it all over your body
step away from the shower for a few
minutes and then rinse off and get out
and it means you don't have to
moisturize after the shower it makes
your skin for really soft and
moisturized and i really like it this is
the one I've got one for dry skin which
says I have almond oil in it and yeah I
just really like this to make my skin
from really nice and it's a huge bottle
and I like the squeezy bits at the
bottom it's like one of those ketchup
bottles which means you don't have to
like shake it for hours so I'm really
impressed
and I think there's a few different
variations of it so I'd recommend trying
this if you do have dry skin and if
you're lazy like me and don't like to
moisturize when you get out the shower
another shout our product is the soap &amp;amp;
Glory the breakfast scrub which is
something I've heard so many people talk
about but I've never tried it because I
just thought it's probably really sweet
and I won't like it because normally I
don't like sweet things but I really
like this it says it's an oat shea
butter and sugar body smoother it's got
bananas almonds and honey extracts in it
it's a really nice body scrub it looks
like this and it smells like smells like
pancakes maple syrup literally it smells
exactly like that reminds me have been
in America in a hotel because they do
the best breakfast in America I love
maple syrup it's my favorite thing ever
so i just love using this in morning
showers because it really wakes me up
and gets me like cited for breakfast I
always really like it because it's got
the perfect amount of like scrub eNOS to
it it's not too harsh it's not too kind
of subtle it really gets rid of any dry
skin without being too harsh and I think
it's good for when you're tanning
because it's not an oily squad my knee
on scrubs too oily to use before I tan
so this is a good one for that I think
I'm really not a tanning expert though
so don't quote me on that but I've
really been enjoying using this and i
just love soap and glory at the moment
the final product is from Bumble and
Bumble and it's their creme de cocoa
mass I've been trying quite a few bits
from Bumble and Bumble recently and I
really love this first of all it smells
incredible it smells just like holidays
and coconut and I love when you use a
product that smells nice in your hair
because every time you kind of wish your
hair like you can get that scent and I
really like that so I love this I've
been using this instead of my
conditioner because it's like a really
thick conditioner pretty much and you
put it on leave on for how long does say
yeah like seven minutes although I never
really understand why they say that
because you can't i'm themselves a
shower i'll have a clock so I not kind
of like singing a few songs and hoping
that that's kind of enough time but I've
really been it liking this and as you
guys now I have quite dry hair so it's
really good for me to use masks and yeah
I think this one's really good if you do
have kind of dry thirsty hair and it
smells delicious so those are my may
