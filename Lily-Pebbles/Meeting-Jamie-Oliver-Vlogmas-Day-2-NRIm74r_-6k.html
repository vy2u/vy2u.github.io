hair you saw me straight to my hair last
night I've woken up and look this is
what happens frizz curl kinks and I
don't completely have to be straight in
the whole thing
morning guys it's vlogmas day two I've
done my makeup now cuz I need to take
some vlog photos the theme is gold and
pink I think it's a really nice combo
I'm gonna write a little post about it
for next week this morning I've got to
do some work I've got a call and then
I've got to take some photos and
schedule everything I've already edited
my vlogmas day 1 vlog and that's been
uploaded and scheduled for tonight at
6:30 so I'm looking forward to seeing
the reaction to that and then this
afternoon I'm going out to town because
I have a couple of events I think and
then a really fun event tonight with
Jamie Oliver
okay now I actually have to get ready to
go out cuz this is what happen it's like
half 12:00 and I'm like half in my
pajamas still and half dressed it's
absolutely freezing today well I think
it is unless my house is just really
cold so I'm trying to find something
warm to wear think we're gonna go for
huge jumper dress because then at least
my body will be warm I try and west of
thick tights I haven't bought my own
Primark super cozy tights yet this year
they're my favorite things ever they're
three pounds and they're like the
warmest hiked you can't feel a wind at
all
I think we're aware this is my cause
dress from last year's like leather
pockets the event tonight it's probably
not too small I want to look nice but I
also just want to be warm I'm also gonna
wear my Astrid and me rings you've
probably seen me talk about this one I
mentioned it in my November favorites or
men do it so I had one of these little
black ones but I got two more so now I
can wear them all together and I think
they're gonna look really pretty just
like lay it up oh go on focus camera
there you go if you know really pretty
rings very delicate I'm gonna wear Jay
Malone blackberry and BAE perfume today
and I'm gonna wear my Asus coat so I
basically look like a funeral director
but I can I like that look it's like a
really long black kind of suits jacket
it's very different to the sort of thing
I would normally pick but I kind of like
it and with boots thing it looks quite
cool okay so I'm headed out now and I'm
actually going to Selfridges to visit
the wire cell cancer they give you a
makeover using the Google glass so they
do the makeover whilst filming you
through the Google glass and then you
can watch the video so if you want to go
home and recreate the look you can just
watch the video so I think that's quite
clever and I thought I want to try it
out so I'm gonna head to Selfridges and
have a little makeover hopefully I won't
look too strange hopefully be really
nice and then I've got a couple of other
kind of press things to be
just got to town and I'm starving so I'm
gonna find something to have some lunch
I really should have gone to pray or
something but there were no seats in
there and I really fats it's a garlicky
vegetables so I went to samba also
they've gone after makes it so easy to
pay with that and speak to the waitress
or anyone so I just sat in there by
myself for a little bit had some veg now
I'm going from my makeover I mean the
smell nice and garlicky for the makeup
artist
okay so I'm finished having my makeover
and it's a nice idea like I like that
you can have the video and when you go
home you know how they've done the manor
but I do think it needs perfecting my
honest opinion because he was kind of
having to crouch down and he was looking
at the glasses the whole time so he
wasn't really looking at mean I felt
like he was kind of filming a YouTube
video I just really feel like I was
actually there
so definitely is perfecting but I think
the ideas are good and I'm looking
forward to watching my video I'm gonna
quickly look at hmmm home to see if
there's anything I can get from my old
birth love being in public when you're
on your own is
so walk quickly bits from each name home
just exciting show you what I got when
they could get somewhere like I want to
get inside it's all about knowing the
back raise in London she's gonna have a
sneaky look and try
just went into all of the bonus and
found loads of bits for riches stocking
so Jen snuck into each other that was
really good I'm now headed to my agents
office and you're probably thinking why
do you have an agent you're not a model
or an opera singer oh I'm trying to
think of my friends I have agents but
they basically help me whenever I have
paid work so my videos with brands or
anything like that so I like to pop in
there every few weeks say Heidi and also
I've got a little mailbox there where
some things get sent so I'm gonna have a
look at that okay I'm gonna show you
guys what I got from H&amp;amp;M home
I'm sure Lucy looks to see as well I got
this copperplate cuz I've seen it before
and I thought it would be nice my little
dinner party to put food on and I got
some napkins
there's gold stars on and I got this
which I have no idea what I'm gonna do
with it but I really liked it true love
never ends true love story never ends
you might mean might look like a cup
guess it could be a mug or like a makeup
brush thing and then I got three of
these to put little candles in and then
oh it's all of a bonus and got loads of
stuff for it just looking rich turn off
now if you're watching but you never
watched my videos so be weird if you
were I got this 50 things to do once in
a lifetime the little cards cuz he
always likes to do weird things mr. t
which he put loose T in and then he
likes it's in your mug and rich like
steam this was just timeout cycle
London's it's all there like best cycle
routes in London so I think he'll love
that
and then I spotted this which I was very
proud I found this it's a book about
old-fashioned which is his favorite ever
cocktail there's all different recipes
and like the history of the drink good
girlfriend
so I'm now heading to nothing he'll for
Jamie Oliver event I'm not really sure
what it's for I think it's nothing to do
with this new book but rich is gonna
come with me and
we there's going to be some yummy food
that was one of the most horrendous tube
journeys ever the proper elbows Sony
before I nearly got pushed over at one
point seriously gotta get you elbows out
by five rich now let me go to the James
Oliver event how was your day
now rich has a pool button so it is
we can source
paradise promised an investigation into
it
sorry we're gonna go yet
not change so we leave a new ban and
that was so nice we got to properly chat
with Jamie Oliver like a few times and
he's such a nice guy and I knew you
would be
at this point he was just so friendly
and the whole vibe of the events great
he's really getting into the whole
YouTube thing and like lobbying at
people and it's it's really cool did he
have fun yes yeah and Karolina Louise
were there and Nick and I have burned
and loads of youtubers it was a really
lovely event we're carrying a lot of
stuff now we're gonna head home
I've gotta do some work and I get back
even though it's late you know so I'm
gonna get home getting time for dramas
and do some editing I have a stitch and
I haven't done anything so any of you
guys get that where sometimes you just
get a stitch from spam you know I'm so
so it's just gonna show us the books he
got for Bailey honey and ASA at work
today there's like a book sale alien
love aliens love aliens love Underpants
but then it's save the world
oh honey thing I love that what is there
just like full story I think okay

love the pictures they can read it and
then to just wanna present the
Scarecrow's wedding by the lady who
wrote was it Gruffalo I'm just going to
my pajamas and I'm gonna start editing
today's vlog because I haven't started
at all and I've got whole day's vlog to
edit says tend to five to ten or god I
can't read the time I'm gonna start
editing now okay it's now five past
eleven so I've been editing for an hour
and everyone's left me and gone upstairs
but I really want to finish this edit or
what I can so far still editing but
Dixie's come to join me Dixie no she's
asleep

so I need to edit this bit that's on my
camera now so I'm gonna wrap up this
vlog for today I've looked at a few of
the comments on day one so far and
they're already nice thank you so much I
