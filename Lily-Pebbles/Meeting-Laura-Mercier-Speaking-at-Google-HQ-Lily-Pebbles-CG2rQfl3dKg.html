and today it's gonna be quite a busy day
yesterday was my first day back at work
after holiday so I had a lot of things
to catch up on but today I'm starting
the day by going to Google HQ to do a
little talk with Louise and Anna I think
which should be really fun and then I'm
going back to Anna's to give her her
birthday present because she's gonna be
away on her birthday and we're gonna
film a beauty chat video I'm also in
Look magazine that's come out today so I
need to get my hands on one of those and
see what the little article is like I
think I'm on the back page where they
like interview someone for the style
files so I'm here at Google look how
orange it is I'm always surprised by the
orange then like a little piece and Look
magazine I think it's nice I wish my
office actually did it like that here's
Anna and Chloe hi look how chic Anna
looks at her Burberry trench coat this
is boring very fancy
it's fun but scary but very enjoyable so
we're now just gonna have some crisps
and Ravena and some fancy can drink
Illuminata look yummy healthy lunch is
so good
piss curse you bitch it's really good
youtube cake pops
I might anyone is actually eating mother
so a bucket anders now after the google
chat which was really good catch up
Louise went to East London I feel like
we've been around the whole world so
back anas we're gonna film our beauty
chat video today which is going up next
week I think so this should be fun
and I need to give her her birthday
present when it's open where I need to
touch up my makeup so anna has said I
can go into this
right let's do this
you just finished filming and we were
both pretty tired cuz it's like the
afternoon and we've been out all morning
so it was a bit of a ridiculous beauty
chat so apologies in advance for some
weirdness and it's gonna be a pain for
me to edit because we just kept laughing
so yes we're done with filming now and
I'm gonna head back home I am
babysitting tonight for my sister and
I've managed to convince my friend Jake
to come a baby sit with me and cook me
dinner because he is amazing at cooking
so I don't know how I did that but I'm
looking forward to a yummy meal thanks
Jake so I'm now at my sister's it's a
little bit later I'm babysitting and
just waiting for Jake to come around and
I forgot to give sorry if I'm talking
about quiet I'm gonna wake the baby I
forgot to give her her birthday present
I gave it to her but we've got to open
it together so she filmed she got mark
to film her opening it it's like a
little kind of glass mirrored brass
jewellery case and from Oliver bonus
she's actually just sent me a photo I
think of her
she's already filled it full of
stationery bits oh my god guys I gave
her an empty card I forgot to write
anything in the card I just gave her a
blank card that is terrible look at this
she said she's laughing a lot I don't
know how I did that that's definitely a
first Jake's here now Jake's gonna make
me dinner
morning guys it's Wednesday now and I
didn't talk yesterday because I was just
at home doing really boring work and you
wouldn't have wanted to see that boring
but today I've got a really busy day out
in town so I thought I would vlog first
thing I'm doing is really exciting I'm
going to meet Laura Mercier who I
absolutely love her makeup range and
really excited to meet her so that's the
first thing we would do three and I'm
hoping Selfridges now or just found out
the selfridges doesn't open till 9:30
and I'm here now at 8:30 for this event
so people give them to go into
Selfridges before opens which is very
exciting so waiting for self just
opening
she's my favorite person ever she's my
favorite that was so nice we literally
sat there flowers to people or immerse
himself and like asking your tips and
she said she liked her makeup and she
could see that's a compliment you've got
it right you point right that was so
cool and she said that the secret
camouflage was no surprise product and
it's like it's like the man that never
lets her down and she loves it so like
the man yeah I was really one of the
best things so I left the others and I
may have just done a little bit of
damage in spacing hey I had to pick up
another Sara Chapman cleanser and they
do them in the tubes now which is
absolutely amazing and people are
looking at me weirdly because I'm
vlogging oh well I'm gonna go have lunch
for myself now because that's the cool
thing to do
hi guys I'm back home now and I think I
am probably the worst blogger of all
time I just kept getting so awkward
vlogging in town I can't walk along
officer Street accessory vlogging and I
just can't do it so what's happened
since I left you and I left you I just
finished breakfast is laura mercier
which was incredible I feel really like
inspired after that and then I had a
couple of other meetings around town I
popped in to H&amp;amp;M and Topshop to have a
look at some stuff and I saw crazy
people queuing outside Apple Store for
the new iPhone mental and then I have
come home I also picked up a jacket a
coat autumn coat from Topshop which I
will show you guys later and now I'm
home I just need to sit down and breathe
for a minute and have some pizza bread
and hummus this is what I'm having and
then rich wants to do a workout when he
comes home and I haven't done a workout
for a long time so the weather's nice I
have no excuse apart from that I haven't
shaved my legs but it's just rich I'm
sure he won't mind
so I'm gonna attempt to do a workout and
maybe I'll film a bit just to prove to
you guys I've actually done it this is
the coat that I got it's kind of like a
trench but it's grey and it's very
lightweight and oh you like it I like
this detail here so I found rich and now
he's making me do a workout and I'm
and I'm really tired ready what we're
doing it would do a little CrossFit
session what does that include
just to warm you up do I have to run
yeah do some hill sprints and burpees
press ups and then do some some new
style of sit up in which isn't talking
to me because I think Viki things I
didn't push myself hard enough but he
doesn't understand that he's like super
super super fit and I'm super super
super super unfit they're like
completely opposite scales of the world
so I'm sweating which I think that means
I've tried I think I'm gonna just have a
shower now and have dinner and relax and
try and convince rich to talk to me
again I'll see you guys in the weekend I
think I'm doing probably something
interesting on the weekend so I vlog
again then bye good morning guys it's
Sunday and two things excuse my hair
it's ironic because today I caught my
greasy hair makeup tutorial oh my god
that's my dad blowing his nose today I
put up my greasy hair makeup tutorial
and today is one of those days it's
always a Sunday and my hair's just
greasy so I've just put it up also if my
face looks weird it's because I just had
laser I know that's TMI but oh well
hairy girl problems today I think we're
gonna go into town because there's a
really cool street festival going on
that's for like a Kids charity and I
love a good street fest of all the food
so we're gonna head there and see what's
going on and then I think I want to come
back and chill this afternoon because
I'm feeling a little bit funny today I'm
a bit nervous I have a photo shoot with
a magazine tomorrow and it's just making
me feel a little bit anxious and nervous
I don't know why I don't actually really
care about why I look like in photos
it's more just I'm nervous about the
environment and being awkward and having
to pose and they told me to wear color
and I don't have any color so I'm just
feeling a bit nervous so I'm going to
come back early later and kind of try
and plan that as well I also don't know
what to do they've said that they have
hair and makeup artist and I don't know
whether to let them do my hair and
makeup or just do it myself because I
want to look like me
so we'll see I might decide later right
quite in Primrose Hill and then we're
gonna walk the cross because the other
side is the street festival which is
here now close by yeah that's where
we're going
nice denim shirt it's not denim Oh
wearing my new Topshop coat actually
rich can you can you show them my top
coat sir looks like quite like bacon
Sherlock Holmes like but stop moving so
much you can make it Marcus it felt well
I like it it's a big found a little
restaurant right in the middle of Rita's
Park this good smokehouse so they do
like pulled pork and chips and stuff so
we're gonna give it a go
I am tired I've just fallen asleep I've
had a Sunday nap and it was really good
I'm not gonna lie I'm feeling really
sleepy though and I need to plan right
you talk first nope
I need to plan my outfits for tomorrow
they said to bring color and I literally
have this yellow top and stripy blue
which isn't even color so I'm just
bringing kind of everything semi nice
that I own and they can pick what to
wear to the shoot tomorrow I need to
wash my hair now and do my nails and all
the boring things that girls have to do
to make themselves look nice and then I
think I'm just gonna chill tonight and
have dinner and read this book I got
this this is Sally Hughes pretty honest
and I'm really looking forward to
reading this it's like a proper big fat
beauty Bible it's not like fancy
pictures or anything it's just full-on
like words like a lot a lot of stuff so
I've read a bit so far and it seems
really good so I'm gonna read more
tonight once I'm ready so I think that's
it for this vlog thank you guys for
watching and I will see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
