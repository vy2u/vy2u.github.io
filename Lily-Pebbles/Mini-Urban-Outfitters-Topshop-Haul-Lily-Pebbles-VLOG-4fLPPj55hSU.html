morning today no baby yet she is going
in today for her second appointment
since her due date so we will see what
happens and what they say but just a
little update no baby here yet today
I've got a couple of meetings in town
I'm meeting with the Mac PR so she's
gonna talk me through any new products
that Mac have out and then I've got a
Joe Malone event which is just like a
pop in so you can get any time between
tell with twelve and six and they're
always pretty epic so I wanted a go pop
along and have a look their new launch
and I need to pop into Topshop because I
wanna get those shoes I tried all in the
weekend and I really want to find some
dungarees it's a nice sunny day so it's
a good day to be out to get a bit of
vitamin D and I will bring you guys
along with me today that lipstick choice
is Urban Decay uptight which is a
comfort mat and the bottom color doesn't
match the lipstick at all just a heads
up it's like a brownie nude think I'm
gonna wear my needle and thread leather
jacket snakes I readings wear this in
it's so stiff I feel like I like it more
when it's worn in so I just need to wear
it I just tied my hair half up because
it's so bushy at the moment it just
looks weird all the way down where my
Celine bag Topshop jeans converse this
little top here is from Kate Spade and
I'm gonna head to burners Tavern which
is in town really nice little breakfast
spot you know today it's banana with me
because I'm a little bit hungry
freakiest but on it ever why doesn't it
curve
I'm just walking two burners Catherine
this is literally my perfect weather
MacMurray jacket is not too hot but it's
sunny and fresh everyone so happy I love
it
I've had my meeting with Mike it was
really cool that season when the new
products every announced I'm gonna
quickly head into Topshop let's try the
shoes Hanna want some dungarees
you know any try on loads of clothes end
up walking out with a workout job yeah I
just happened
I'm just heading to the Jo Malone event
now it just thoughtful I leave she
didn't see me she just literally just
missed each other so I'm gonna go and
see if there's anyone else I know and
that
I just got home and I'm just taking a
minute on the sofa while I get over my
motion sickness I thought I'd show you
what I got because I didn't really show
you properly so from Urban Outfitters I
tried on loads of stuff but nothing
looked good but I ended up getting this
workout top they didn't have a medium so
I got a small but it kind of bit alright
so it's an ID - best top I know everyone
thinks I say addy does funny I think
that's how English people say it I know
some people call it Adidas we call it
adidas
so that's for working out and then I
also got Steve Madden shoes I absolutely
love Steve Madden shoes they just fit me
really well you know when you find a
shoe brand that just works for you I got
my wedding shoes from Steve Madden which
I showed in my new clog I didn't
actually say the shoes
I just thought would be really good for
the summer and I could probably get away
with wearing them the smart addresses
and also Ragini's so they're really know
healed I'm five foot seven so I don't
really like wearing heels and I just
find them really uncomfortable so this
gives a little bit of a heel and they
kind of got that rough around sadly look
that's quite popular at the moment and
the only thing I didn't love about them
is that these wrap around the legs and
it's not that comfortable and I don't
really kind of want them to it without
my legs you can just wrapped around the
ankle as well see I thought those are
really cool I think they were about 60
pounds which isn't that bad and then the
lovely people jo Malone gave me a bag
after the launch and all the kind of
press and bloggers that go and get a
little bag oh no it's got some badges on
it I really like the theme of this
launch it was like London in the 60s my
parents grew up in London in the 60s and
there are teenagers so I loved all that
kind of imagery and stuff I'll show you
what's in here so this is a little press
release I think the pictures are so cool
boxes all wrapped up then this is the
fragrance so it launches in September is
they have like one big launch a leave a
year and then lots of kind of smaller
ones so this is a big launch it's basil
and neroli I don't actually like the
lime basil was who fly buzzes Amanda and
they like original
in fragrance I'm not a fan of but I do
actually really like this one I've got
it on my wrist now and I'm kind of
seeing how it settles on my skin it's
very fresh it's a unisex fragrance that
girls and guys can wear it and I think
this would be a popular one actually
it's very easy to wear nice for just
after the summer it's very uplifting
so that's the new Joe Malone launch I'm
gonna hang here this afternoon and do
some work because I'm going out for
dinner tonight with Deb's and pool and
rich we're gonna go to the pub it's like
two-for-one on a Tuesday night so we
thought it might be nice to have a pub
dinner and the weather's still really
nice parents gonna be nice on the
weekend as well which is amazing because
I'm going to a festival and Saturday so
that would be rubbish if it rained Carly
still hasn't had the baby just in case
you cared someone commented of my last
video saying no one cares about this
bloody baby I think everyone else cares
I don't know she went for a checkup they
won't they don't induce you in the UK
like unless you're over a week overdue
or something so would you see what
happens
I told her to relax I've just been
hanging on the sofa and doing work on my
laptop because I'm feeling a little bit
like sleeping weird I don't know what
was wrong with me today
anyway I just asked on snapchat and
Twitter and Instagram and Facebook for
questions for a Q&amp;amp;A video because I feel
like I haven't been able to answer
questions on social media that much this
month just because I mean having videos
go up every day so it's been like so
many more comments and I usually get
that I haven't been able to reply to
everyone so I just said if you have any
questions and this may not do a quick
Q&amp;amp;A video so I'm just looking through
those now there's so many I'm just
greenshot seeing the ones that I think
are good it's so funny how things have
changed clay you just get questions
about lipstick and now all the questions
are about wedding and babies okay I'm
gonna head out now to go and meet rich
Deb's and Paul we're going to pub for
dinner I just bought my leather jacket I
don't know if we're sitting outside or
not because this pub the quite an
outside a pub so I'm bringing my jacket
in case and that's all I have to say I'm
really sorry if this vlog is boring I
kind of thought I'd have a more
productive afternoon but I'm just not
feeling it today this is where I'm going
for dinner and I'm pretty sure I'm the
first to arrive so I'm going to go back
to the table I didn't have to sit alone
long
would have arrived it would a drink I
got wine and they go gin and tonic gets
all the money on camera so no filmer and
pulsar although is very happy these are
macaroni and cheese balls with spicy
sauce are amazing and these are
my source
we have two chickens burger and fish and
chips I don't know why I ended up with
the biggest one I'm probably the least
hungry yeah defeated how is your meal
cars over here finished in it was really
nice it's so bright oh I love that about
summer we're gonna give Deb's and Porter
left home we are home now I always say
that I hate myself we had a really nice
dinner with Deb's and Paul in the pub
and it's 9:30 which to most people is
probably bedtime but I've just realized
I've got a shoot a video shoot with
Thursday and my hair's I have awkward
length it's about to get greasy and my
tan is faded and I won't have time to do
either wash my hair it will tan tomorrow
so I think I'm gonna wash my hair in
town now and I thought before I kind of
sign off I'll show you what town and
stuff I'm using at the moment because
I'm using - let me turn off this fan so
I'm either using the Bondi sands liquid
gold this is if I don't have time to
wash off the tan like the next day
because this one is just the dry or you
put it on and that's it you're done or
if I have time I'm also quite enjoying
this one at the moment this is new and
China out its the visa Liberace
phenomenal this is sort of one you have
to apply like a nighttime and then wash
it off the next morning but I feel like
this one is a little bit better in terms
of streakiness it's kind of easier to
use I don't know which one I'm gonna use
tonight but those are both very good and
I've also been trying out the BT
Liberata face tanning serum a lot of you
guys commented on my tech video saying
he thought I did quite and I didn't
think this was working but maybe it was
so that is what I'm going to do now I'm
also loving the body shop Pina Colada
range I will use so much of the shower
gel and the body scrub is great for
tanning and conditioner there aren't any
particular ones I'm loving at the moment
I'm just using whatever's in my shower
really look how pretty these flowers are
by the way that were on our table I feel
like they're just getting prettier and
prettier each day they've lasted really
well got them from waitress
okay I'm gonna sign off now and I don't
think I'm my belonging tomorrow I wasn't
planning on vlogging tomorrow but then
I'm not sure what I'm gonna Park on
Thursday they bravely got a builder here
all day building a cupboard for my
office actually let me show you guys
this is my office
the further and there's a really awkward
gap here you can kind of see
we're getting shelves but here and they
were getting the cupboard built so we
can move these drawers and that's what's
happening tomorrow see you guys in my
next video I don't know what it will be
and when but it will be coming I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
