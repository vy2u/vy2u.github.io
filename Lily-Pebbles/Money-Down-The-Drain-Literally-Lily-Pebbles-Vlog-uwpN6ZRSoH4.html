actually just heading to ethos which is
a new relatively new cafe on East Castle
Street and I'm gonna meet Anna and
Madeline Shaw I'm so excited to meet how
we've never met I absolutely love her
recipes and book so really excited to
catch up with her I'm just in the middle
of hilarious
April Fool's with my manager and I feel
so bad line but it couldn't have gotten
any better she really believes me I
basically told her that I'm getting a
lip job because I want to be like Kylie
Jenner so funny she's been so sweet
about it and clearly trying not to be
judgmental well I can't wait to tell
it's an April Fool's on absolute idiot
I've just realized that I got to ethos
at 10 a.m. our breakfast isn't till
11:30 Anna was like I want the train I
just got on I'm going to be like an hour
and a half great so now I'm in town

I like rushed here for no reason so I'm
gonna go make myself busy I might pop in
see my manager and tell her that wasn't
it before but she like kills me if I
leave it C long I'm gonna go into the
detox kitchen to get inside hi guys
sorry it's me coming from the future
just quickly interrupting the vlog to
say that when my facebook page gets to
100,000 likes me and Anna are gonna do a
live stream video which we've never done
before so I feel like it could be
hilarious terrible or one of those I'm
not really sure but please go and like

stream video so I'll link my facebook
page down below go give it a thumbs up
