video for April it's much easier to talk
about things that I like rather than
write about it so I think we're trying
new videos from now on if I have the
time so I've got quite a few things this
month that I've been loving so I'll get
on with it the first thing is something
which I've had for a while but it seems
that suddenly everyone's talking about
it but I've had this for a while now
it's the quarterly beauty elixir and
this is the small size I've got this at
a work event it's basically like a
refreshing face spray that also helps
your skin and it says it gives you a
smoothing and glowing complexion it's
really nice it has a really interesting
smell it's very like sort of minty and
very refreshing and I've been using this
when I've been going out after work I
sort of redo my makeup a bit and then
spray this on it just sort of refreshes
me and just makes me look alive again
because by the end of the day I look a
bit like I'm dying so this is really
nice and it's a nice travel size for my
handbag the next thing are the new Essie
polishes from Superdrug so Superdrug I
don't know if you all know but they've
got a new line of SD which is their
seventeen most popular shades and for
$7.99 so that itself was exciting and I
went out and bought loads but then when
I got home I realized that they've
actually redesigned the brush which is
one of the only things I didn't love
about Essie polishes before they're
quite hard because the brush is really
narrow but they've redone the brush and
they've made it much fatter and wider
and it's just amazing now it applies
like a dream so I sort of made two trips
there since they came out and I got tart
deco masterplan
I got mint candy apples I already had
but I had to buy another one because
this brush is so much better and life is
of luxury and lydic ism which is one of
my favorites so five polishes let me see
if I can show you the brush it's just
amazing so the brush is like that it's
so much wider than the old ones and it
just makes applying the nail polish so
much easier so they say
99 from superdrug I don't if they're in
all the super jocks yep the one I got it
from was Marble Arch in London and
little really nice display and I'm just
loving the new I see so definitely and
the next thing is there a lip product
it's the l'oreal rouge caress I've got
to my favorite one is the coral one
these sort of rival products for the
Revlon lip butters I actually think I
prefer these even though I raved about
the lip butters before the this one
applies really smoothly it's really
moisturizing you don't need a mirror to
apply it you just put it straight on and
it has a really nice coral I just think
this is lovely I think I'm gonna wear
this all summer and I been keeping in my
handbag all the time and everyone always
compliments me on it when I'm wearing it
so this one is called dating Coral 301
and these are like $7.99 I think but
just kind of I did I bought a few and
then it ended up being quite expensive I
think no worth it they don't last that
long because it's kind of like a lip
balm but it looks really nice when it's
on then I've already spoken about this
in my NARS summer 2012 collection video
this is the NARS eyeshadow palette in
Ramat well and I just love this I've
been using this everyday and I know I'm
gonna use this all up by the end of the
summer
I'm sure lovely shimmery peachy colors
and really easy to wear so that I've
been loving this month as well I've also
developed a strange obsession with
origins this month I think when I went
for the facial I don't know if you saw
in my vlog I went for an origins
brightening facial and I just fell in
love with origins all over again and now
I'm addicted so I went that day and
spent about fifty quid on products which
is crazy but I'm really happy with what
I got and I think it's worth it
the first thing I got was the drink up
intensive overnight mask so this is when
you put it on it's it's clear but it's
just like a really really thick
moisturizer and you're supposed to leave
it on overnight and by the time you wake
up it's gone if there's any excess you
just wipe it off with a costume or pad
but it's just amazing if you
have sort of dehydrated or dry skin it's
so good I can't actually explain to you
how incredible the smell is this is the
best smelling skincare thing that I own
by far
it smells like pineapple and
passionfruit oh it's just amazing and
click addicted to the smell of this and
it's massive so it's gonna last me for
ages say just before you go to bed
you've cleansed you've done everything
you just pile this on like a thick
moisturizer for the first of all our you
do have to kind of sleep on your back so
you don't get one of your pillow but it
soaks in quite quickly and you wake up
and it's just disappeared and your skin
feels amazing so I've been loving that
mask the other thing I got from origins
is the brighter by nature high potency
brightening peel with fruit acids
it says brightening peel it's not really
appealed these are basically they come
in a little pot like this they use this
only in the facial which is why I bought
it
and inside are cotton wool pads and
these are sort of pre soaked cotton wool
pads let me try and take one out of here
so it's like this they're pre soaked and
I had already have sort of the
exfoliating products on it so you just
use one of these and wipe it all over
your face and exfoliates your face and
it's so easy to use you just need like
one a week so these are gonna last me
I'm gonna put this sermon there's 40
pads in here so it will last me ages
it's a really easy way to exfoliate
sometimes I fight exfoliated a bit of a
chore so when I got these I just knew
I'd do it every Sunday night it's easy
um so you just use a pad all over one
sides a bit rougher and then turn around
and sort of smooth all out and chuck it
away and you're done and my skin feels
amazing after using these they do smell
a bit um
is there like nail polish remover it's
quite strong
um so I kind of press up your nose a bit
but my skin just feels so good at the
moment after using this and this um yeah
I'm just loving origins I think they're
really amazing products the last few
things were talked about Annie on
products are quite few neon products and
this month I've been loving
full of them in particular first one is
the neon organic body scrub we've got
massive this process
it's amazing um I just keep this in the
shower
it's really easy to use and it's just
the most luxurious thing ever it's like
a proper like sugar oily sugar
consistency and it just smells like like
a spa that's the only way I can describe
it it's the most incredible smell I've
written a blog post on this I'll put it
below but I've just been loving using
this pretty much every time I'm in the
shower and I think it's just a gorgeous
gorgeous product
the other thing from neon is hand wash
which may sound a bit weird
I think hand wash isn't something you
thought by I don't know it's like any
mum's buy like expensive hand washes but
I've been thinking like I use hand cream
all the time and I'm quite weird about
like I have to have my hand cream so it
kind of makes sense to have a nice hand
wash as well I mean I go on the cheap
every day so my hands just like get home
in the end of day and wash my hands and
it's just black it's disgusting so I'm
really happy to be using a proper nice
hand wash now um and this is just so
nice
again smells like a spa and it's just
makes washing hands much more enjoyable
but yeah neon products both they're all
just amazing products and these the ones
I've been loving the most this month so
that's everything I hope you've enjoyed
watching all the products that I've been
loving this month I'll try and do this
as a monthly thing now let me know if
you enjoyed it and thanks for watching
