monthly favorites and I've actually got
quite a few this month and ones i really
liked like now looking at them or lay
down on the floor it's made me quite
excited because I've got some really
good stuff to show you today so I'm
going to get on with it the first thing
is what should I choose first okay the
first are two highlighters and face
highlighters and they're both high end
they're both kind of similar but quite
different as well so once burberry and
ones Christian Dior so I'll show you the
burberry one first and this is called
the sheer summer glow and its really
nice packaging it's got the check burr
blueprint on it and it's like metal and
you open it like this it's a little bit
annoying i find that you can't open this
all the way back it just opens up like
that I don't know why I just quite like
it when things open all the way if you
know what I mean so this highlighter has
two bronze colors on one side and then
to sort of highlight colors on the other
so it's kind of a real multi-use product
which is why I like it there's a darker
Brown a lighter brown and showed over
there Matt I think they're both quite
shimmery actually and then there's a
pinky highlighter and a more white
highlighter and its really nice you can
either source oil brush around the whole
thing and then use it so all over your
face or sometimes I just use the brown
colors to contour with and then like
either both highlighters or I'll just
pick it depends so you can either use it
like four ways or all together it's
really really good and I really like it
and the quality of the products really
nice there's a really nice print
actually on the product as well which
mine is starting to disappear in the top
bit but I think this is a really good
product i'm really impressed with the
burberry stuff that I've tried so far oh
and this is definitely one of the best
ones I think it might be limited edition
I'm not one hundred percent sure but I'm
sure they're going to bring more out
like this because i think it was really
popular so the other one is a deal
highlighter and one that I heard loads
about and it's the amber diamond
highlight
so the reason I got this because I heard
about it for ages and fleurdeforce talks
about a lot Tanya burr um kind of
everybody talks about it really and I
never thought I really needed it but
then they said they were going to
discontinue it so I went to the counter
and I looked for it wasn't there I said
the lady do you have this as she said oh
we've got two more in the drawer but we
are discontinuing them so I was like I
have to get it because it was amazing
and they're stopping selling in the UK
so I bought one and then I found out
from Amelia from Liana beauty that
they're not discontinuing it anymore so
I felt it goes a little bit tricked by
the lady at the counter but I'm glad I
got it and it looks like this I don't
love the packaging in the source of blue
and it's quite plasticky I don't like it
as much as the burberry one and but it
looks like this it's kind of very
shimmery if Alex gonna fall everywhere
and so it's got like a white highlighter
that goes to a sort of champagne II
color and then it goes bit more bronze
and then a kind of more like orangie
buttons as well like a this isn't kind
of taupe and then it goes kind of Franz
it's really really shimmery but this is
really nice sorry I had to go close the
window because my dog started barking
outside and what was I saying so this is
really really shimmery but it's nice
because it means it shows up I find with
highlighters sometimes I can't really
see when I put it on so here's a little
brush and I sort of swirl it in the
evenings I'll swirl it sort of all
around and use the darker colors but
most the time I just use the lighter
ones because I don't want to sort of go
to oranjee and I think this one this one
in the end could be to oranjee for me so
I mainly been using these ones but i
really like yeah he's a little brush and
put on my cheekbones and I think it's
really really nice I maybe not as
obsessed with it as everyone else seems
to be yet but maybe I will as I use it
more but yeah I've been really liking
those two highlighters especially this
month the next thing it's a bit random
maybe but it's Maxie cotton wool pads so
these are the ones that alike let me
find an example they're like this so
they're the
big ones basically I used to use the
little circles but then I discovered
that it made someone who says to use
these because I only need like to when i
was using smaller ones i needed about
four so i just use one for my eye makeup
and then one for my face and that's when
i'm using the biderman state by makeup
off and they're really nice and I keep
them in this jar on my dressing-table
which I really like to keep them and I
think it looks really nice and sort of
very Paris like them so cheap more in
there one thing I will mention so these
are the ones they're called cosmetic
maxi pads and they're from boots and
they're really nice um I ran out and i
just bought some from superdrug thinking
they'd be the same and they were
horrible they were so so hard they
actually hurt my face when I use them
and normally I would just use up their
use them up and then get these next time
but they were so horrible I had to like
I saved them to use for my nails because
it doesn't matter if they're soft my
nails and then I wait to buy more of
these so if you do get them make sure
you get the boots ones or maybe there's
nicer ones in superdrug but the ones i
got we're really horrible and rough so
yeah i've been loving those this month
they've been very helpful the next thing
is origins makeup I spoke about this on
my blog so I'll link the post below and
origins are sort of releasing a makeup
line gradually over this month and next
month I think everything's sort of
release at different times that these
limits that I've absolutely been loving
this month the first thing is this
concealer which is called the plant
scription anti-aging concealer it's
quite a few anti-aging bits which is
good I guess even though people normally
think anti-aging means for older people
it's actually for people like me who are
like in their twenties anyway this is a
concealer and it's very similar to the
collection 2000 concealer in that I
think people like that because it's got
really good coverage and it's in the
same sort of applicator like like this
um but sometimes I found with the
collection 2000 concealer as you kind of
expect from a cheap concealer can get a
little bit cakey and especially if it
got dry skin this was really really
moisturizing and doesn't look cakey at
all so I've actually loved using this
and I
definitely repurchase this I can't
remember how much is but I know that's
worth it i also have a mac moisture
cover i think it's called and the colors
in makka just too orange for me so this
is a perfect color match its number 02
light medium and I absolutely love this
and also it's sort of go alongside that
is the origins plant scription
anti-aging foundation which is SPF 15
and I spoke about this in my most worn
things in my summer tag video this is
color 02 light neutral as well and this
is amazing I'd actually go as far as
saying this is probably my favorite
foundation now I prefer it to the Gemma
kid I prefer it to Laura Mercier tinted
moisturizer I just absolutely love it
and the reason i like it so much is
because it's really moisturizing which
is good for my sorts of skin which is
sort of normal to dry i probably not
sure if it would work on oily skin you'd
have to give it a go really moisturizing
and so it feels like a tinted
moisturizer but it's got quite good
coverage as well but not so much like
with the Jemma Kidd light-as-air
foundation even though I do like it in
sort of the winter it can look like I'm
wearing too much makeup I find with me
that if I'm wearing too much makeup it
really shows that around my nose and
around my chin and my sisters normally
the first one to point it out they look
like I'm wearing too much makeup but
with this 1i never ever get that sort of
dry patches or anything and it's so easy
to blend and so easy to build up and
it's the perfect color for me I love the
packaging it's really small and easy to
put your makeup bag and I actually
haven't got one bad thing to say about
this I'm properly raving about it so
when it comes out please go try it
because it's so so so good and then the
third thing from the origins makeup is
the origins ginseng brightening mascara
another thing I really really really
need to rave about because this is
probably again one of the best mascara
as I've used and it says it's for
lengthening and lift but i also find
it's amazing for volume it's just
basically got the most ridiculous brush
I've ever seen I'll do a close-up of it
it's just absolutely massive it's quite
a long brush it's really
like Harry it looks like a massive
tarantula it's like various brush ever
and I find with this that you hardly
even have to touch your lashes to make
them long and thick literally it's the
easiest mascara to apply I think it
lasts all day it doesn't smudge at all
on me the whole brightening things are
supposed to like writing because it's
ginseng like the ginseng origins product
I don't really feel like it brightened
my eyes but I guess when you have longed
for our lashes it can make them look
more awake um but yeah I absolutely love
this it's a big massive fat mascara and
I think it's really good and I would
also have you purchased this definitely
so those three are all amazing i'm so so
impressed that or it doesn't make up
stuff and another favorite to sort of go
alongside this is my Real Techniques
Real Techniques stippling brush and I
normally use the buffing brush the
foundation I have done for the past of
three or four months but like I said
before I I sometimes I look at my too
much makeup around here and I thought
maybe I try using this brush again
because the last couple of months in the
summer I've been wearing either more
sheer foundations or tinted moisturizer
which quite different like a heavy
foundation so I use this brush which is
quite different to the buffing brush
it's not as dense and it's got these
hairs that sort of come out the top
which makes it sort of lighter coverage
and I didn't used to like this as much
because I felt like it was leaving me
streaky but now I think that may have
been the foundation i was using because
when i use this brush with the origin
foundation it's the perfect match i find
it easier to blend than the buffing
brush it's not quite a kind of as tough
and it just doesn't sort of cake on the
makeup as much it gives you more che
coverage and i think this is really good
for tinted moisturizers and i've been
loving easiness recently so glad I gave
it another go and I really like this and
the next thing is another origins thing
and be obsessed with origins clearly
it's the clear improvement active
charcoal mask which says it's clear
pores so it's basically a clay mask
is it clay it says charcoal kind of
feels like play it's like a proper
proper thick black like when you squeeze
us onto your hand it's probably the
scariest thing ever it's like tar and
you put on a face it's just really weird
experience you should really try and
this is the the travel size which
they're doing at the moment for ten
pounds they're doing trap like ten
travel sizes of their most popular
products I think they still have them I
saw this one in John Lewis so go and
have a look if you like origins um I
thought because it's kind of a thick
charcoal black mask I thought it would
be quite heavy and you know get really
hard and kind of hurt your skin but it's
really weird when you put this on I put
it all over my face like avoiding my
eyes and mouth and stuff and you meant
to leave on for about 15 minutes and it
feels really fresh it kind of feels like
your skin is like zinging them I can't
really explain it really feels like
you've got like wind blowing in your
face that's the only way I can explain
it really refreshing which is so not
something I would expect from like a
black mask and the only thing with this
is it does get hard and then after 15
minutes when you take it off I find it
quite hard to take off and I feel like I
have to drag my skin with a muslin cloth
and that's a bit of shame you don't
really want to do that to your skin
after having a nice mask on and but I'm
still sort of figuring it out and
finding ways to make removing it easier
but I my skin feels amazing after i use
it i really really like it's definitely
one of my favorite masks now so i've
been loving that the next things I've
sort of spoken about so much recently
but definitely a favor from this month
is the fresh sugar lip polish and the
fresh sugar lip treatment so this 1 i've
had since Christmas in america and this
is the mini one that came in a set from
sephora i also had the lip balm I ran
out I think I showed it in my empties
video and I recently repurchased it from
the store on mullah in high street in
london and it's a basically a massive 1
i'm glad i got it because this was
actually easier to use so this one's a
lip balm like this and it's just the
best lip balm I feel like I've spoken
about it for better lip balm I've ever
used I use it at night for its bed in
the morning
when I wake up and throughout the day if
I need it and it's just like put one
swipe on on your lips are like
moisturized about two to three hours i
swear i'm not exaggerating it's amazing
and this is the exfoliating scrub to go
with it which is just a sugar scrub
which is really good for getting rid of
dead skin on your lips and really easy
to use and it tastes and smells really
nice I can't I suppose it smells like
brown sugar I can't describe it but yeah
that's not like brown sugar and it's
really yummy and i love these two and
i'll definitely get more when i run out
although i think the full size of the
exfoliator the scrub is quite massive
and i like the little pot I don't want
to buy a big one so hopefully I won't
finish this too soon the next thing oh
this is the last one I feel like I've
gone really quickly to this video sorry
bit manic today and this is an eyeshadow
from Illamasqua this is an eyeshadow
from Illamasqua and it's called
forgiveness does it just work the color
no it doesn't okay so it looks like this
it's like a plummy purpley brown and I
actually went to an illamasqua
masterclass makeup thing and I went in
my mom and it was really nice and they
did a demonstration on my mom because
she wanted to know how to do like five
minute makeup routine because she hasn't
got much time in the morning and not
much patience either so she wants to
know how to do that and they did her
makeup and I one part they used this in
the crease and I instantly fell in love
with it it's is it Matt I don't it looks
quite mad it may have shimmer in it but
it's not very shimmery at all you can
hardly see it and it's really nice to
use in the crease and also underneath
the eye and I never thought about
wearing sorts of purple before but
because it's kind of purply brown it
just works so perfectly on my skin tone
and with my hair I really really love it
and i've been using it loads this month
and I actually noticed as well that
forgiveness this color is also in one of
Alaska's pallets from the generation q
collection which is just come out I
think I think it's coming up or maybe
like really soon but there's a whole big
launch at the moment and this is there a
compliment palette
called and forgiveness is in this
palette this is what it looks like and
it's got forgiveness which is that one
and then it's got a darker shimmery
purple and then sort of a champagne
color and then this is a cream brown
pigment and this is a really nice
palette and I'm really glad they put
forgiveness in there because I really
love it I probably shouldn't have got it
on its own now because I have the
palette but it's nice to be able to take
it out like especially if haven't grown
away or something and I just want this
one but yeah so if you do like the look
of forgiveness color I'd recommend going
to look at this palette because it's a
really nice palette as well this isn't
like one of my monthly favorites because
I've really just got it and I haven't
used it much but forgiveness the plummy
color definitely is I really really like
it so that's everything I think yeah it
is so thank you for watching and I hope
you liked seeing my favorites and i'll
see you in my next video thanks bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
