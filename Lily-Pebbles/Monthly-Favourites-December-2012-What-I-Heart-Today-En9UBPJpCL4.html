favorites video the last one of the year
I can't believe it I am going to do a
2012 favorites video as well which would
be my next video and I think just one of
the items from this video will end up in
that one but these are the things I
still wanted to do in December video
because these are the things I've been
loving this month even if they're not
the best products I've discovered this
year they're still once I've really been
liking this month so the first product
is my NARS sheer glow foundation and
this I've had this for ages but I've
fallen back in love with it I was
shopping with Anna from Viviana's makeup
and she was saying I really want to get
nasty glow I miss it I think she may
have given it to a friend or something
like that and I was like oh I have mine
just sitting in the back of a Jordan it
just made me want to try again so I
tried it and just completely felt it
back in love with it so thanks Anna for
reminding me to use my knowledge should
glow foundation and I have the shade
fiji and which is perfect for me now
actually I really like the shade and
it's just a really nice foundation it's
not sure at all it's actually quite a
heavy coverage compared to most other
foundations that I have but it applies
really nicely if you use your hands it
goes on really naturally and fees your
brush to get bit of a fuller coverage
but both are completely flawless and I
really like it I bought pump for mine
because it doesn't come with a pump
which is very annoying but once you get
a pump on it it's really easy and I
really like this foundation the next
favorite for this month is fragrance and
you've heard about both these fragrances
i took what wouldn't up all the time and
it's my molecule-1 and my stellar but
this month I've been mixing them and
layering them up I know a few people
that I think meg and Gemma if you would
have told me that they smell really good
together so I laid them together and I
love it and I've been wearing the
combination of these pretty much all
month and its really nice they just
really complement each other so that's a
really good combination next is my
rituals hand scrub and I absolutely love
this I did a blog post on my kind of
hand care routine which and i'll post up
a link in the description bar below this
is amazing I've never had a hands felt
before I always used to just use a body
scrub in the shower on my hand
but this is so amazing it's the hand
therapy ginseng and ginkgo biloba that's
what's called nourishing softly enhance
club and it really comes out as a read
gentle scrub it doesn't hurt at all but
I just kind of rub it all over my hands
and then you put them under water and
then you just Pat them dry with a towel
and then use a hand cream and it makes
such a difference I use hand cream every
day but if you use hand cream without
exfoliating the cream doesn't really
soak into your hands and especially
there's loads like dead skin and use
your hands all the time so there's loads
of their skin so when I use this it was
just incredible my hands felt amazing so
I'm really impressed to this I
definitely recommend i think it's 10
pounds for this size and it's one of the
best hand products I've ever showed next
is my lyric toner which I showed in my I
just spilled it all over me I showed
this in my Paris haul video and this is
just a really nice turnout i cleanse get
rid of my makeup and then I just use
this on cotton wool and it takes off any
makeup you may have missed and just kind
of tones the face and I really really
like it and it's full of vitamins and I
love the packaging and just really been
enjoying this I really use that much and
I've been using it for quite a while now
and I used quite a lot i use like four
or five pumps on a custom wall which is
more than you need but I like that kind
of wet fresh feeling and so really
impressed with that the next is another
product I think I've spoken about a few
videos and I'm absolutely love with
Emmet's pas mais divine bomb I think
it's good and this is from colt beauty
and this saved my lips they have so so
dry they are still a little bit dry but
I just love this and I used it on my
finger when I bet myself with my
straighteners I you can use it anywhere
it's just one of those like
multi-purpose amazing bombs and it's the
best i've ever tried better than any
other and i love it love it love it and
this lives in my handbag and i can't go
anywhere hood assets I'm obsessed it
smells like cinnamon actually doesn't I
don't like cinnamon it just smells like
yummy food um it's much better sent and
Lizabeth ordinary
which I can't stand and I really really
like this this may be featured in my
2012 favorites maybe maybe not and the
next product is moisturizer and this is
my origins high-potency vitamins and I
talked about this in my winter skincare
the blog post which i'll put the link to
below and this is a really nice
moisturizer that i use at night comes a
little tub and looks like this it's
quite a hard dense thick cream which is
why i like using it at night I just like
to smother my face and cream before i go
to bed and really hydrates my skin and i
get quite dehydrated skin especially in
the winter so this is perfect it smells
like zesty oranges really really yummy
smell a little bit medicinal they're not
in a horrible way but riddhi on me and I
just I love this I've actually used
loads even though it doesn't look like
it's quite a big then in there and I
really really like this as a night cream
it's the only one I've been using for
about a month now and I absolutely love
it and I probably won't use anything
else until I finish this because I'm
really happy with that the next product
is a mascara and this is the DJ v view
tenaya volume lash and this is also from
colt beauty and i never heard of this
before but Caroline hearings is a
massive fan of it and she has excellent
taste so I was looking for trying it and
although like she also commented you get
too much product on the brush they kind
of need to make the whole a bit tighter
because I lies you just wasted a lot of
product but perform I it's amazing this
is what the brush looks like it's very
long it's kind of like a fine but it's
not plastic one it's one of the like
fluffy brushes which is what I prefer
the garo but it's not like too big and I
think it'd be really good people short
lashes as well and this just gives loads
of volley into my lashes and makes them
long and give some volume and does
everything I've worn from mascara and I
really really like it I probably will
finish this too quickly because of the
whole like too much product problem but
maybe they'll repackage it and I still
think it's worth by and I really really
like this mascara the next is something
i showed in my home video it's my mac
quad i have been
easiness so much this month this one
looks like I can't till too much because
I departed some of these eyeshadows I
haven't put a magnet on so they're not
actually secure and over to my kind of
tilts that they fall out this is
handwritten this is charcoal brown this
is wedge and this is patina and i have
been using these all month i absolutely
love patina all over the lid i think
that's a beautiful color and wedge is
nice in the crease but we're just
probably my least favorite and i
probably didn't need that you can't fit
doesn't really show up that one on my
lid charcoal brown is really nice for
the crease at under the eye i love this
it's like my inglot one that i always
use and charcoal brown it's lovely for a
brand smoky eye and i really like these
and this is really good for like
traveling taking away just build your
own little quad these packets these M
quads are like five pounds maybe and not
too expensive and then you can just kind
of build your own little perfect for
eyeshadows so really been liking that
and then my last favorite is very random
but very Christmasy as well and it's
this sellotape farm habitat at I've been
using this to wrap my presence and i
love it made me feel very festive much
better than boring or plain sellotape
it's red with little white reindeers on
and i love it and the habitat actually
bought my wrapping paper from habitat
this yeah i never normally go in there
my friend needed something and we went
in I saw all the Christmas stuff it was
on sale so i bought it all and i really
like it the only thing about this table
i probably should have paired it with
like a really plain wrapping paper but i
got like a reindeer print rapid but and
this it all looks a bit much I've been
rubbish at wrapping this year for some
reason but i still let Seth if anything
makes a little touch on the presence so
that's all my favorites this month don't
forget to check the next video which
would be my 2012 favorites which is
literally I'm so excited to film it it's
all the products i love that I've
discovered this year and it's going to
be massive so don't forget to check that
out and thank you for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
