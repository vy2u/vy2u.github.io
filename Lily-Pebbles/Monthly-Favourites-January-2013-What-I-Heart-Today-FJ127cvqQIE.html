here with my January favorites and I
have a couple of regular favorites this
month but the rest are mainly beauty and
actually now looking at them I think
most of them are I products I don't
really know how that happened obviously
quite into like I make up this month but
I'm going to start with the kind of
strange favorites and get those over and
done with and the first one is actually
a blog or actually it's kind of more of
a website but it's called a beautiful
mess calm and it looks like this and
it's run by two girls Elsie and Emma and
it's just the most amazing website ever
they have crafts photography recipes
home decor fashion beauty like literally
everything you could ever need and the
imagery is all amazing and the food
especially is so nice like macaroons and
stuff I actually love it and I'm
obsessed and I've kind of I know a lot
of you probably know it it's really kind
of well known but if you don't you
should go and look at it and I've just
been scrolling back like years and years
reading like the whole website because
I'm obsessed and its really nice to read
at night as well if you have like an
iPad or an iPhone or anything like that
kind of look at it instead of like a
book at night it's really nice and
relaxing and I'm just obsessed at that
website at the moment the second kind of
strange favorite is this notepad and I
showed you guys this in my whole video
my Christmas birthday haul video and
this is an all akili notepad that rich
brought me my boyfriend and I just love
it I'm going to probably like geek out
now about stationary but I love
everything about it so it's big and if
you guys are also into station you know
it's quite satisfying when a notepad
kind of opens flats I hate when it kind
of keeps popping up and I have just been
using this for like work and everything
and I love it and I carry it everywhere
even it's big I really really like this
notepad okay now on to the beauty stuff
the more kind of stuff you're used to
seeing first one is a jo Malone perfume
and this is a new fragrance for Joe
Malone and it's all gray and cucumber
which is just so strange when this
landed on my doorstep I was literally
like a whole gray and cucumber that's
like possibly the most British sent I've
ever heard of my whole family drinks
Earl Grey tea and I thought that was
normal teeth because I was just used to
it growing up when I was about 18 I've
tried PG tips for the first time I was
like revelation book so I know oh very
well and it really does for like Earl
Grey and the cucumber in it makes it
really fresh and it's just really light
fresh easy fragrance to where it's just
really different it's hard to describe
so you should go and like have a sniff
at gemini encounter if you can but i
really like it on my skin and it lasts
really well and I've just been loving
wearing this for the past kind of a
couple of weeks the next thing is
something you've always seen a lot of is
definitely not a new product it's the
urban decay naked palette but I kind of
sometimes I forget to use this and then
I go through stages of using it a lot
and January has been one of those months
I did a kind of series of blog posts
last week where I did three looks with
one palette using this palette and it
just completely inspired me to use it
more often I absolutely love it and it's
the more shimmery of the palette with
loads of neutral shades and I love all
of them i don't really use the front of
end to as much the kind of louia shades
but i use all the rest loads and i love
it i don't have the Naked 2 palette um
it just didn't look like something that
I needed the kind of cooler Matt tones I
don't really wear and The Naked basics I
don't really have any interest in
because I don't wear those shades but I
absolutely love this one love love love
and it's really good I've spoken about
before but if you try again to I shadows
I really recommend this a cravat has
everything you need it when my sister
was getting married she bought this and
she kind of hasn't bought any eyeshadows
since this is all you need the next
thing is from Clarins and it's the
instant light complexion Perfector and I
have a couple of the shades and I've
decided after testing they're both quite
a lot that my favorite one is zero zero
rows shimmer and it's kind of a paste
one there's there's three there's a
champagne one which is more of a gold
any color and then there's quite a dark
tan color I really like this I've been
using it two ways I think
mixing it with my foundation which I
really like using this with the Laura
Mercier cream silk creme foundation
because that's quite a thick foundation
sometimes I find it quite hard to work
so I mix it with this and it just makes
it lighter and easier to blend and it's
also nice to just use on your face as a
base before you put any foundation on
tinted moisturizer on and it's basically
just a nice kind of shimmery liquid and
it's not glittery I like chunky glitter
it's really subtle but it just gives you
that nice glowy dewy look that everyone
kind of seems to want and I get asked
that question a lot by friends and
family how do i get a glowy dewy look
and i've been recommending this recently
because i think it's really nice kind of
multi-use product and i love it now I
have some more I stuff I literally have
a lot of I stuff in this video but I've
been wearing the combination of these
three eyeshadows a lot recently not on
purpose but then I keep realizing when I
go to take photos of my makeup for my
blog I'm like oh I'm writing the same
makeup again I can't take a photo so
I've obviously been worrying this
combination a lot it's still a kitten
which I showed in my whole video with
Mac patina and charcoal brown I have it
in this little palette for two i
recently bought to take a holiday
because i didn't want to take for
eyeshadows it's quite bulky i just
wanted to take my to kind of favorites
for the moment so i bought this i love
this little palette it's like 650 best
thing I fought recently so yeah i've
been using stiller kitten on the sort of
inner first half of the eye then patina
kind of blended in on the second half of
the eye and charcoal brown in the crease
and under the eye and i just love these
three together i think they work really
well this is the perfect kind of mutual
I for me you can definitely achieve this
look using the colors from the Naked
palette but I just have these eyeshadows
and really like using them at the moment
and it's kind of smaller than having
that whole palette I'll probably take
these threw it away with me then I have
a product which I'm a little bit
embarrassed to talk about on youtube
because it's such a stereotypical
product but it's Mac stereo rose and I
had no interest in buying this this this
came out a long time ago in collection
for those of you who haven't heard about
the holster rumors being it came out a
long time ago in a collection everyone
went crazy for it sold out that happened
again and
came out recent it's just one of those
products that everyone always seems to
want to buy when it comes out and i
found one like when I thought they'd all
sold out I found one and I tried it I
didn't really like it I thought it was
too shimmery to pink lost interest
didn't buy it then I went out to buy Mac
soft and gentle which I did really want
to buy actually and I went to westford
and they didn't have any they sold out
and the lady was saying to me try this
try this and I'd already tried it but
she tried it on me and I kind of liked
it so I just took the plunge and bought
it i have a blog post on this going up
tomorrow on monday so definitely check
that out for kind of swatches but it's a
really nice corally pink color and
really easy to wear and you can kind of
use this instead of a highlighter as
well so it's like a blush and a
highlight so I'd like to use it kind of
slightly higher up on the cheeks I think
I'm wearing it today actually slightly
high off the cheese and then it kind of
works as a highlight and a blush and i
really like it now I completely gave in
to the hype but I'm glad I got it then
for the last two products to more I
products the first one is this mascara
which I am completely obsessed with it
is by far the best mascara I've used and
I know I said that by origins I love
love love the origins mascara but I
think this one is better and it's the
clinic high impact extreme volume
mascara and i have a blog post going up
on this on wednesday next week so
definitely look at that as well but it's
just the best mascara how can I even
explain it it gives length volume and
the thing I notice it's different about
this subscribe to others is that you
literally just need like one coat you
hardly have to touch your lashes and
even though it's in one of those kind of
plastic you ones that I don't normally
like it really grips up to the lashes
well which is why i like it and i got my
mom's try as well and she has really
short little eyelashes and she loved it
as well so i think it works on all
different kinds of lushes and it's
amazing i think there's about 18 pounds
I thought it was more so it's not too
bad but it's so good I definitely
recommend this is the best mascara I've
tried and then the final product is an
SD
stay on shadow paint and this is in the
color change these are their new kind of
cream eyeshadows and I talked about this
in my I did a post on let lots of
different cream eyeshadows which I'll
link that below to us about this thin
and I've also got it coming up in one of
my what's on my face posts I'm writing
this today actually it's just a really
nice bronzy color lighter than other
bronzes I have which I really like this
would look incredible on someone with
green eyes but i like it on brown eyes
as well and the difference between this
and other cream eyeshadows i have is
it's quite Lucy it's not as hard a cream
so I've actually used a brush for this
is that my finger and you can really
blend it out and it's quite fun to blend
that I can't say this is really
easy to blend but then as soon as you
stop it kind of sets and then stays
there all day but it's really
long-lasting lovely texture and I think
the main thing i like about is the color
because it's quite different to other
cream eyeshadows i have just a really
pretty font Franz and i just use a
bronze eyeliner with it kind of same
color and i really like it and i have
been loving using this and i'm very
impressed with the formulation of them
and they don't smell too bad which is a
bonus so that's all of my January
favorites I hope you liked seeing what
mine were leaving a video response if
