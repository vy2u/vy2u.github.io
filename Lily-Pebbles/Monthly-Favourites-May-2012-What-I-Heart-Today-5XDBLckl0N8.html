favorites video in the garden so I'm
here sorry there's like planes my
neighbors are mowing their lawn it's so
noisy hopefully it will come out okay
but there's not that many things to show
you this month anyway I don't really
know why i feel like i've been loving
loads of stuff but then when it comes to
going around and like picking things in
my favourites video it really wasn't
that much this month so first thing is
this book we got given these at work and
they're made by a company called sloan
stationary which is a london-based
company in Sloane Square and it's a
really nice pink it sort of like
alligator print thing anyway I've been
using it to organize my blog and list
products for this video and all things
like that it's just been helping me get
really organized and I've been loving
having this in my handbag I put a couple
of Jemma Kidd products this month first
one is the lightest air foundation I use
shade three I've nearly finished this
and they've actually sold out everywhere
they're out stock so I haven't got
another one yet and i'm a bit distraught
about it had to go up go on to another
foundation I do really like it the only
problem is that the packaging is so bad
like you can see how Bobby is gone and
so that's a bit of shame and like way
too much product comes out so I probably
wasted loathe that's why I've run out so
quickly but part of the packaging the
foundation is so nice in it so yeah I
wear shade three light medium and I have
been loving us this month and it's SPF
18 which is good for weather like this
the other Jemma Kidd product is
something everyone always talks about
and the jewy glow all over iranian
supreme i use the one in rose gold even
though I've had this for absolutely ages
this month I've just been loving it
because it has got sunnier I've been
wanting a more sort of jewy and this is
just the best product I found for doing
that it looks like this it's a cream so
I literally just get my finger and I put
it on my cheekbones down my nose a bit
there and it just does the job and I
love it i've been using it every day
this month every day I've also been
loving the OPI nail envy I use this
every time I paint my nails now and it
helps strengthen my nails because before
they were getting really flaky and they
haven't flaked in ages since i started
using this and its really nice as a base
coat as well so i've been loving this
and it was worth it was nothing it's
really good that's what it says it does
i've also been loving on with others and
everywhere the next thing i've been
loving is the mac jaunty eyeshadow from
the hey sailor collection that i showed
in my last videos and i've been using
this every day as well it's so nice it's
like a base coat on your eyes a really
nice shimmery champagne color and I
don't know if you can see they're kind
of really really nice just so easy I've
used this every day as well an outfit
you love it there's definitely worth
buying while the collection still out
and then the last thing on it's not the
last thing the next thing is the nooks
lip balm I mentioned in my whole video
love this I'm already extended explain
what it is like a matte lip balm scoop
the products output all over your lips
last four to five hours it's just
amazing and I've still got loads of
product left so this would be going for
months and months I'm sure but I keeps
in my handbag I applied every morning
and achieve around midday and then I'm
on the tube and I love it it's really
does a good job with my lips a really
good condition because of it and then
the last thing these shoes and so
summers back and last time we had a
little bit of a heat wave I freaked out
that will I had his black boots and I
went out and bought some shoes and then
the sun went away so like Wonder paintin
sort of pale pink mage mission Topshop
and they kind of look like brogues a bit
and it is really like these they are
quite comfy I do get slight blisters in
the back of my foot but they're not as
bad as some issues there are these other
pumps that fit me because I'm a half
size so i can never fit into six or
seven s and these on seems to be okay so
i'm happier families and i've been
enjoying wearing them in past sort of
few weeks and it's been sunny so that's
my may favorites and i hope you enjoy
seeing all the products i've been loving
sorry there weren't that many but that's
just how it is i'm already the loss of
week four loads of new things that i'm
already loving so I know that June
favorites we'll have loads of stuff in
it so you know hip you've lights been in
my garden and thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
