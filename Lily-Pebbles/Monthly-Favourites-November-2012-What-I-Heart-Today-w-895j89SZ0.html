favorites video and this one really
crept up on me I completely forgot about
it until someone mentioned it which is
why I have kind of last day greasy hair
and everything is a bit kind of rushed
but I ran around sort of collecting my
favorite products it's quite easy to
choose actually but I just hadn't really
prepared myself for filming today but
yeah I'm going to talk you through it
all the products I've been loving this
month so what should I go with first
let's wet nails and the nail polish I've
been loving is a top shot moonshine
which I've shown in a couple of blog
posts and it's kind of like a metallic
rose gold and it's so nice and it goes
on so easily like you and you really
need one coats and it goes on really
thick and opaque and I really love this
I've had it for ages I don't you know
why I haven't been using it but I've
used it as I can all over polish and as
like a dotting oh my god I'm when / nail
polish this is how its organized I am
today I never wear no nail polish I
tried a new nails inc polish last night
and decided I hated it so I took it off
as the concrete 10 horrible um so I took
it off at now I just have an inner
bullish on so yeah anyway back to this
one this is really nice and I definitely
recommend it if they still do it cuz i
know this is quite old where I got this
one um and I've also been loving my nail
dotting tools that i got from amazon
i'll put the link below i've mentioned
these before and i love them i so if you
bought them since i read about them
people keep tweeting me telling me some
of my friends have bought them and
they're just so much fun if you want to
like experiment with your nails and
they're so easy you just kind of a poor
bit of nail polish onto a plate and then
actually i have my plate here this is my
nail plate so i just pour a bit of
polish on and then use these just
dotting the polish and you can kind of
make all different shapes and they're
really fun so i really like these i
really got want to make up thing this
month I kind of been experimenting a lot
with new makeup so I haven't really got
favorite this month because I've just
been trying those of new things and but
i really liked origins blushes and
and this one here 06 sunset peach which
looks like this and it's just a really
obviously peachy color I love peach even
in the winter I just think it's a really
easy kind of natural color to wear on
your cheeks and these are really nice
quality they're really soft I really
like oranges makeup it's a brand you
wouldn't think would do good makeup but
everything I've tried from there the
foundation the concealer that blushes
the mascara they're all so good so I
definitely recommend recommend an
origins makeup and this is a really nice
blusher I've also been loving my soap &amp;amp;
Glory phone call shower gel which I
showed you guys in my hall and how much
have I used attend off the dance I can't
see now I think I'm kind of down for
there this is so nice smells like big
kind of peppermint a grape seed fake and
orange it's just really nice and loose
can be soft and I just really like it so
I definitely will look into more soap &amp;amp;
Glory things because I kind of went off
them for a while but this has made me
like them again and on the sort of big
topic I've got really back into my
dipped teak fig kind of fragrances my
perfume philosophers are like nearly
finished I've literally got like that
much left I love this love it love it
love it and I normally just right in the
summer but i'm not sure why because i
think it kind of works all year round so
i've been wearing this a lot just like
why our new finished and i also bought a
new fig candle I was in the dip teak
store recently I just had to get
otherwise my favorite is the fig candle
when I got kind of the medium size and
this is just so nice it just sometimes I
get very stressed and lighting this just
makes me feel so calm and fills the
whole room with like this gorgeous Figgy
smell and I really loved it I loved it
tea candles so these 2 i've been loving
myself fig things again before skincare
i'm absolutely obsessed with this
product it is the nude cleansing oil for
face and eyes this stuff is incredible
when I got it I just kind of thought
I'll give it a try not sure wasn't that
kind of face by it the minute I used
so I wanted to give it like a full-on
proper testing so I didn't remove my
makeup a biodome at first I used this
he's like one squirt for my eyes and it
literally breaks down your makeup so
quickly it all comes off like every bit
of mascara eyeliner I was wearing like
one of those words providers at never
budges and it came off straight away and
then I sort of washed my eyes with
muslin cloth and then use like two more
pumps just for my faith and it's so nice
because it's an oil it's really good for
like colder months because it kind of
leaves your skin feeling really
moisturized and nourished afterwards and
not have stripped like some gel
cleansers or the cleansers would i'm
going to do like a proper review of this
on my blog i think next week i've got
like a whole winter skincare four-part
blog post coming up so don't forget to
look for that but yeah i really like
this this is like making my skin feel
amazing this mi mi hardy and cleansing
balm together just like the winter
Savior cleansers absolutely love it
definitely recommend it is expensive but
this is definitely worth it it really is
so good um and then I got fue hair
things quite a lot of hair things
actually first one is the mask which I
mentioned it in my pool video a while
ago this is the Pheo specific intense
nutrition mask of plant marrow this is
just incredible it's completely changing
my hair this is a bad example I'm having
a bad hair day um but it makes my hair
so soft and kind of strong it my has
really brittle it breaks easily it's
damaged from heat and it's been dyed and
curly it says been a mess but this is so
good at my hairdresser just keep
commenting on how good my hair is since
i've been using the odor on shampoo
conditioner and this he like he didn't
do my hair for years and he's amazed at
how much it's changed i love this i try
to use it kind of once a week if I
remember it also depends when I wash my
hair but it's so nice and it's in little
pumps it's very easy beeping in the
shower and love it definitely going to
be purchase it when I run out which will
be ages hopefully and then I have a few
things from fee of five which is kind of
new for me I'm not like a massive vfi
fan normally but
that I haven't tried that many things
for them and this is from the smoothly
does it range which is good for my kind
of hair i guess if i want to wear it
straight then i kind of want it to be
smooth and not frizzy and these are the
three products that I've been really
liking from that range first one is the
heat protect serum they all kind of heat
protects which is what I really like
because obviously if I straighten my
hair like everyday I need heat
protection so this is the serum which I
use after straightens it when it's
feeding a bit like hot and puffy and i
just put tiny bit this on and it
completely smoothes it out gives it a
bit wait which I like for my kind of
hair and um yeah I really really like
this serum and there's also the tame and
shine spray heat defense which is really
good because most heat defense products
are kind of like a spray liquid which
means that i canna use it when my hair
is wet before i straighten it the first
time round but when i wake up in the
morning my hair is really curly i have
to kind of restraint in it so it's
really nice to have a heat defense that
spray that's kind of more like an
aerosol because then it doesn't wet my
hair it just kind of puts a mist over at
frustrating it so this is really good I
haven't seen anything else like this so
that's the tame and shine spray really
like that and then the refresh me quick
dry shampoo which is really nice the
only other dry shampoo i really like it
resume and it can make your hair get a
little bit white sometimes if you do it
too closely but this one hasn't doesn't
seem to make my hair go white it smells
nice yeah it's most kind of fruity and
yeah really like this it isn't i'm a
bigger can as well which is good i'm not
a fan of Batista at all based my hair go
white so it's nice to find a new joists
shampoo that i like and then the final
things from my favorites video i kind of
comfy winter snow big things if you
follow you on Instagram and my
instagrams Lily pebbles you'll probably
see me like instagramming me being cozy
like once a day I've got really into
hats I don't know why I'm didn't really
realize all the hat person when I wear
my hair down hats do kind of suit me I
think I've got quite a small face those
that God takes
my whole head but these are the hats
that I've been loving this is my hat
that I got last year from River Island
which is a little panda with two ears
which I really like Zoey from the London
lip gloss literally saw me last week and
like what are you wearing on your head
she's laughing at me I think it's cute
the head kind of goes like back like
that when you wear it and so I like that
one and I got couple of new hats I'm
literally addictive run server tag on it
this one is from Topshop actual they're
both in Topshop and this one kind of
matches my scarf thing I don't know if
you guys have seen it but it's kind of a
similar print it's got a little bobble
on top and lights of black thing around
there and this just fits my head really
nicely but quite some more hedge so it's
nice and snug which is good and yeah
I've been loving this one keeping me
warm and then this one I haven't quite
decided if I'm going to keep it yet but
not I love the color it really suits me
this piece of colors so I like that it's
kind of more of like a rounded hat
because I haven't got bobble I'm just
not sure about the shape but I do really
like it this one's like 12 pounds i
think this one was like 14 ridiculous
topshop prices but yeah really like hats
keeping my head warm in the winter and
then the final thing is my one piece
which is just ridiculous or onesie but
the brass could one piece that's why I'm
calling at one piece and so the website
is one piece top heard UK now I got
given this I like hosted an event and
this was kind of my thank-you present so
I didn't have to pay for this and I'm
not sure I would they're so expensive
they are like 150 120 pounds which is
crazy for like loungewear but if you get
like an ASOS discount code or anything
they sell them on there so keep an eye
out for this guy coast because it is
worth it this is my own is like a bright
green it's got a hood and the zip goes
all the way up and then it's like a
massive all in one onesie with the
bottoms like elasticated it's basically
like track see Boston material that's
what I like about it a lot of onesies
I've seen a prime market are quite thin
which kind of defeats the point unless
you want to work Jarvis I wear this kind
of when I'm
engine around and it's so thick and cozy
I love it I'm literally obsessed with
this onesie so yeah they're all really
expensive but if you get discount code
they do sell them a nice sauce and a few
other places so look out for that
because it's literally become like the
love of my life the only problem is it
is a bit painful need the toilet for
guys it's all right you can just kind of
zip up this awesome zip but for girls
you've got to basically get undressed to
go to the toilet just a bit annoying but
it's amazing i love it then I'm
literally gonna live in this all winter
so that's everything for my November
favorites next time I do one of these
videos I'll be 25 it's my birthday on
the 9th of December and so I'm really
excited for that I'm the vigor apps and
drinks and my friends and go for a nice
breakfast at my family and do nice
things so yeah I hope you like this
