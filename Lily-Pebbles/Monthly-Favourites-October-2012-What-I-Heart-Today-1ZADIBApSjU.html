favorites video no I say this every
month but I can't believe October's
finished already this month is gone so
fast and it's Halloween tomorrow I
gentlemen this video is going to go up
but it's Halloween tomorrow and so it's
very exciting and I'm really excited to
go into November actually November is
when I have the most birthday it's all
my friends and families birthdays are in
November it's so annoying so November's
always quite poor month for me but fun
month as well because it's loads of
birthdays and buying presents and stuff
so I'm excited for november and then
it's december it's my birthday and
christmas and the best month of the year
so i'm really excited I'm gonna get
started and show you the products I've
been loving this month it's quite hard
to make the list um this month but
there's just so many things I really
because it's kind of gone into autumn so
I've changed up my makeup products and
everything like that so there's loads of
products that I've been loving I'm going
to start with these two they're both
boils the first one is a body oil and
this is the origins ginger gloss
smoothing body oil and this is so nice I
have the body cream with this scent and
it's ginger I actually don't love ginger
like eating ginger but it doesn't really
smell gingery to me and so I really want
to get the oil because I loved the body
lotion but I don't really use body
lotions that's often cuz I find a little
bit of a hassle for some reason I just
never end up using them I really love
the smell and this is so easy it comes
in a spray so you literally jump out the
shower of the bath and you just spray it
all over your legs and arms and takes
like a second to Robin and it makes your
skin feel really like moisturized and
soft and the smell is amazing like when
I come downstairs my boyfriend always
says like wow you smell really good and
it's this really refreshing zingy kind
of smell I really really like it I mean
if you're wearing perfume if you're
going out I wouldn't recommend using it
because a scent is really strong but I
use it when i'm staying in after having
a bath or shower and it's just so nice I
really like that so that's the origins
ginger gloss of body oil and then
another oil very oily at the moment I've
been
it is a hair oil and it's the mythic oil
rich oil and mythical fort out I think
for new oils they just had the original
one now they put a rich oil they've got
one for colored hair so the rich one is
for unruly hair like mine and there's a
come-on for colored hair which i also
really like and then there's a milk kind
of mist which I think's for fine hair I
really really like this and I've been
using it when I straighten my hair in
the morning sometimes it goes a bit kind
of staticky in and bit frizzy so I just
let you put like half a pump of this you
need a tiny mouth that's the only thing
I don't love it's quite hard to get like
a small amount out because quite a lot
comes out on a pump put like half a pump
into your hands and I just run it
through like from there from mid to the
ends of my hair and it just makes it
look so smooth and there's no frizzy
bits and it just completely changes my
hair and I love it and when you use that
much but I've been using it quite a
while so it's going to last quite a long
time so I really really recommend that
as the mythic oil and it's the rich oil
which I do prefer the original one the
next two things are nail things the
first one is a top coat and it's the
leighton denny crystal finished top coat
that looks like that and this is really
good I didn't really have a top coat
that i love before i use sesh feeds
which I do really like and I don't know
why I don't use anymore I've still got
it kind of fell out of love with a bit
but he is because of what a bit gloopy
so I probably need to get a new one or
something go but this I've really really
been loving I find that it goes over
nail polish really easily and I know
sometimes I feel like topcoats drag the
nail polish underneath even when it's
dry but this one just really smooths
over it and gives it a really really
shiny finish and also makes my nail
polish last longer and I really really
like this actually I'm just now sort of
getting into Layden's any products and
try and a few out and I'm very impressed
by this one I was added a blog post
about a few other ladies any nail
polishes so I'll lick that below another
nail thing are these dotting tools I got
these from amazon so you get basically
five in
set and for those of you who don't know
what got you tools on let me take them
out they are basically they look like
pens and I'm each and they've got a
little dots and at all different sized
dots and they are for doing nail art a
bit like this I don't know if you can
see em but I've done that I've dotty
nails today and there's lots of other
things you can use I know you have to
buy dusty tools you can use coxed
cocktail stick so it's called a
toothpick or a Kirby grip from your hair
those things you can use I just really
wanted some dotting tool so I got these
but they were like three pounds to pound
fifty from amazon which is so cheap and
you get five in the all different sizes
and they're really kind of good quality
and I've just really enjoys of playing
around with them and do some different
nail art designs are quite I'm not like
a meeting at a lot i really enjoy sort
of playing around and trying different
things so I've been loving using those
and I've got dirty nails today and you
don't it's not just for dr. you can sort
of drag the dots and do patterns and you
know if you're patient and you like nail
art definitely worth getting some
dotting tools so yeah I really love
those and the next thing of the perfume
of us which I've spoken about my blog a
few times already and it's the stellar
by Stella McCartney perfume and this is
the limited edition one she brings out
three limit edition of bottles I think
twice a year to go alongside her fashion
line and they are so here there in this
really cute little cup and bottles I
love it it's perfect for your handbag
and the lid just comes off at the
perfumes there and you can actually see
how much you've got on the side it's
kind of purple and clear I love the
print I actually took the ages to decide
which one to get rich bought this for me
as a present the smell is really
different to anything I usually where i
usually wear a kind of fake fresh green
perfuse and this is a bit heavier it's a
bit more of a nighttime perfume but I
smelt it on Gemini from James bakula
it's like her she's been wearing it
forever and I really just wanted to try
and see if it suits it makes normally
they don't see me
perfumes I tried it on water run
Selfridges and I really liked it rich
that he liked it which is always a good
sign so I bought it and i really like it
is nice to sort of layer with other
perfumes I mainly wear this I like a
night out or on a colder day because it
is kind of it heavier than the perfumes
are you normally wear but most my
perfumes are quite summary so it's nice
to have kind of more or to me perfect
where it was really nice and then the
next few things are makeup first of all
the lipsticks that I'm wearing I'm
loving this lipstick for autumn is
illamasqua magnetism and it's a deep
raspberry pink lipstick and it's a bit
dark turn lipsitz I usually wear so I've
been loving wearing this in autumn
illamasqua lipsticks a really good
amazing quality so i really like those
if you want a new sort of autumn
lipstick I've recommend looking at
illamasqua and the next one is an
eyeshadow primer and this is from
kryolan they've recently rebranded and
this is part of the new products that
they have and this is really good and I
talked a lot about the MUA primer that I
have which is really good okay so good
don't cheap alternative but I really
really like this one I need to find out
where you can buy corel on form and i'll
put the link below but this is really
good i just sort of put it all over my
eyelids or for wearing my eyeshadow and
it kind of makes it easier to apply and
keeps it in place kind of all day so i
really like the little tube as well i'm
really impressed with that and then i
have an eyeshadow which i am wearing
today and i haven't been using this all
month this is a bit of a cheaty what
I've only had it for kind of a week and
a half two weeks maybe but I absolutely
loved it so I really wanted to include
it it's burberry and it's the mulberry
eyeshadow and it looks like that if this
is one of their new ones it's kind of a
topi brown plummy shade I say well
that's my dog barking so I just do
wearing this all over the lid I use like
217 Mac brush to blend all over the lid
and then a smaller brush to just take it
underneath it really flatters my
coloring but I think it would work for
quite a few different skin tones and
colors as well but I really really love
it the quality is amazing this burberry
I mean it was like 21 pounds i think
which is a lot for an eyeshadow if
something like this which i think i'll
wear for the next or four five months
straight it's kind of worth the
investment i think i really love the
packaging i'm just so so impressed and
it because it's a new one I think might
be a limited edition I'd get this color
soon if you'd like it just in case it
sells out and but yeah I've been loving
wearing that pretty much every day I'm
addicted to it and then the last of
things are blushes first one is naz
outlaw which is part of the
autumn/winter collection and this is a
really nice their thing they call it a
rose dusty rose pink or something which
to me sounds like pastel pink but it's
quite dark compared to most blushes that
I use but it's really nice and wearing
this one today as well and magnetism
mulberry and this together like my
autumn makeup at the moment pretty much
an everyday thing but really really love
it NAS blushes you know how I feel about
NAS blushes they're amazing definitely
worth getting a nurse but if you haven't
got one yet and then the second blusher
and the last product from this video is
bobbi brown pink rose and I'm 42 and I
think I've been where I wore this in the
last three two or three videos i filmed
so if you commented asking what the
flusher is it would have been this one
and it just looks like this really sort
of natural dusty pink color really
pretty kind of easy to wear that's why
it's kind of become part of my everyday
makeup routine which I have a video on
don't it's gone up before this or after
this but I have an everyday makeup video
going up so check that out and I use
this in it just really really natural
blush and really easy to wear and very
 the bobbi brown blushes a really
good quality as well and I like how the
lid opens all the way I know that's
weird but that's something I really like
in products and so that's everything I
hope you enjoyed seeing all my favorite
products from October and next time I do
this it will
Christmas I can't believe it um so yeah

now and doing more videos hopefully kind
