my sep tember favorites and this video
always creeps up on me I don't know why
I try to plan ahead and think about what
my favorites are but then it's always a
sudden oh my god favorites video what
have I been loving this month but
actually once I thought about it there I
got together quite a good little group
of product also just to let you know
there is going to be a giveaway at the
end of this video so keep watching to
the end and then you'll see the giveaway
so I'm just going to get started and
pick something it random the first thing
is going to be this Essie nail polish
and this is called meet me at sunset
this is the first non superdrug boots
Essie nail polish that I've bought in
quite a while because they bought that
new range and i love the brush but then
I kind of got bored of the colors that
there weren't any others i really liked
and I saw this one with lyceum having
liberties or somewhere and so this has
the old brush but I just love the color
and I really like the Chanel holiday
nail polish but as I said in my one of
my last videos I don't love chanel and
nail polish just because they chip so
when I saw this I thought it was a
really good joob for that one I haven't
tried it but it looks pretty similar
it's kind of like a red but with an
orange eat own because I don't really
wear red nail polish so I like the song
because it's a bit more orangie it's
just something really different and
something i don't have anything similar
so i've been wearing this loads and
really really like it um so that was the
old se price that they're like 13 pounds
or something but I'm happy I got that I
really like the color and the next thing
is this kiehl's hand cream and this is
the ultimate strength hand solve and my
friend gave me this um I don't really
know why she had it in her handbag or in
here do you want this I think she's got
loads of them and I really like it
actually and really like plain packaging
which is very kiehl's and it's basically
just I'm going to put some one lab just
because I can't really remember and i
went to put some hand cream on it's like
a normal white hand cream but what i
like about this it hasn't got any sort
of fancy smell to it just smells kind of
plane and maybe a bit medicinal and it
doesn't leave
any kind of greasy film afterwards it
rubs in really nicely and just it feels
like it's really moisturizing your hands
it feels like you know some hand creams
are just to make your hands man lies
they normally do the job I feel like
this is really moisturizing and my
friend that gave it to me actually
suffers from really bad egg smell on her
hands and she said this really helps
with it so seems like it's a proper
hardcore hand cream to me and i like the
little tube it's really nice in my
handbag and I'm nearly finished it i'm
definitely going to buy another one will
buy one because i didn't buy this one so
yeah I'm definitely going to get one I
really like this and I think it's
actually my favorite hand cream I've
ever tried which is quite a big
statement and I use a lot of hand cream
so I'm quite pleasantly surprised that I
wasn't expecting it to be that good and
the next thing is this MAC lipstick and
cut this for ages but I've just been
wearing it loads this month it's syrup
and it looks like that it's kind of like
a purpley turn lipstick like a move
which isn't something really i'd pick
out but it just looks really nice on and
it's kind of a natural neutral look I
just find it really easy to wear like
everyday and it doesn't look like well
like you're wearing lipstick sits the
lustre finish which has really nice and
quite moisturizing and I've just been
wearing this loads this month not for
any particular reason but I just noticed
that when I think about what my favorite
so I thought actually I've been wearing
this a lot this month so i'm really
liking that and I'm kind of nearly
nearly finishing it which was a bit sad
but I'll definitely repurchase that when
I do finish it the next thing is this
esop parsley seed mask and I mentioned
this in my whole video I've really
enjoyed this I've tried it a lot this
month and let me read about it it is a
perfectly formulated antioxidant
clarifying mask designed for frequent
deep cleansing suited to most skin types
this mask removes impurities and
refreshes the skin so yeah like it says
it's very clarifying it goes on like a
thin cream and some people said this
didn't happen for them but with me it
sorts of separates and certain
areas i'm not really sure what that
means but it looks kind of cool so after
about 50 minutes that have like a big
round patch there where it will look
like there's no mask and it kind of goes
like a bit patchy but then wash it off
and my skin just feels really clean and
detoxed and refreshing refreshed rather
and I really like this so I've been
actually looking into esop more i bought
a cleanser yesterday so i'll let you
know how I get on with that but I love
it there's a new stool in the selfridges
beauty workshop and it's just so good
the staff is so helpful literally if you
go in and say I want to cleanse that I
don't know what type though they'll sit
there and they'll try them all on your
hand and I think I've already said this
in my last video but they're just really
helpful and I've really enjoyed like
every shopping experience I've had there
so this is the parsley seed mask and I
really like the kids for like all skin
types and it comes in this lovely
squeezy tube so that's a good one this
month and the next is a sort of range
and i only got this couple of weeks ago
so it's not the whole month but i love
it so much that i had to put in this
video and it's the bobbi brown long-wear
in range so um I am lucky enough to be
able to try some of these products and I
got the long we're even finish
foundation the long-wear cream shadow in
velvet plum the long wear black eyeliner
and the long way intensifying mascara
and I am so impressed with products I've
tried them every day pretty much for the
last two weeks because I really wanted
to when it something says it's long
wearing I really wanted to like put it
to the test and see if it actually is so
the foundation I think is so good it's
slightly more coverage then I would
normally wear and but it still leaves my
skin quite cheery and fresh I've been
applying this with a brush it's SPF 15
which is good for daily wear and I think
there were a few days last week where I
literally left the house at eight and
got home at ten thirty 11 at night and
I'm not joking my makeup looked pretty
much the same when I got back I'd say
towards the last two hours of the
evening it started
to look a bit dodgy but it lasted most
of the day I'm so impressed and I've
been using this foundation loads and I
really really like it so I'd recommend
trying that the cream shadow comes in
this little glass pot and this is like a
sort of plumbing metallicy taupe and
this is incredible but I've had such
problems recently with eyeshadows
creasing like no matter what primer I
use it just seems to crease all the time
and I applied this with a brush I didn't
want to put on too thickly and sometimes
when use your finger it goes on too
thick so I applied this with a brush and
splendid it over my lid and I'm not
joking it lasted me all day like this
seriously excite something I'm
definitely going to go and get a few and
the other colors because for me
something that'll definitely last me all
day is just I don't care i'd pay so much
money for it because it actually works
there was no creasing whatsoever and
loads of people complimented me on it
this is quite a dark shade so i feel
like it's a bit too much for every day
but that's why when i get a few lighter
ones but for the evening this is just
amazing and i can't believe the lasting
power the sirius is not lying its proper
long-lasting the eyeliner is also really
nice i use this in my waterline it
lasted all day i also used this just on
the top of my lashes and blend it out
with a brush quite quickly so i had a
smudgy effect and then that lasted all
day as well and I just got so many
compliments on my eye makeup that day I
really liked it and then this also comes
in a box with a little pencil shop now
which I thought was really nice that it
comes with the sharpener because I
always feel like a pencil sharpeners
look not something you want to go and
spend money on especially like a bobby
brown one but if it comes with a product
and that's great so that's a really good
eyeliner I definitely look into other
colors especially for if you use
eyeliner on top of your lid because
those often sort of disappear after a
few hours so to find one that lasts all
day is great and I'd probably look into
a brown or a plummy color as well for
autumn and then this is the intensify
mascara and when I opened this you'll
see it's a tiny tiny wincy brush and I
thought that must be a lower lash
mascara by kind of looked into it
think it is I think it's for everywhere
but I mean that's too small for my
eyelashes so what I've been doing I've
been using it on the lower lashes which
I don't normally use mascara there
because it just goes everywhere but this
again lasts all day and I've also been
using it on the top I use it as sort of
a base so i use it first and then i go
over with it sort of more volumizing
mascara so this again is really good my
mom's been trying it as well and is
really liked it so overall I'm just
really impressed with the bobbi brown
long-wear products and couldn't
recommend them highly enough so go and
try them if you work all day and go out
off the work and you need products that
last all day and they're perfect the
best I've tried I think the last
favorite is this book and this is called
what's left of me by kat zhang and i've
been lucky enough to sort of preview
this book this is the uncorrected proof
version um and I've been reading this
every morning on the tube and every
evening when I come back on the cheap as
well that's like my reading time I do
have a kindle but it's nice to actually
read a proper book I haven't done that
for a while smells like bookie um so how
can I expect I want to talk to you about
this book but I don't want to you know
people blab on about books and people
get a bit uninterested so this book is
based in America and it's about these
young people some children are born as
hybrids which basically means that they
have two souls two personalities in one
body and in the book they pretty makeup
letters to people like lily and someone
else in one body and they're like
sisters normally what happens by the age
of sort of 10 the kids settle which
means that the dominant personality
takes over and the recessive one sort of
disappears and it just becomes one
person but what happens is that some
don't settle and it's become illegal in
America for hybrids to exist so this is
the story about this girl that is a
hybrid and the narrator of the book is
the recessive personality the one that
isn't domina
and so she's just talking from within
her sister's body and the whole book is
about this struggle to sort of keep
their secret and you know not get put
away and it's it's really sad actually
it's so gripping though I haven't been
out to put it down they say it's a love
story my friend read the back and went
this is a love story of it read love
stories but it's not that kind of love
story it's a love story between sisters
and families and it's really amazing
actually I'm literally how far I'm that
far in so I've got like a quarter to go
and I'm really excited it's kind of
getting to the bit um so I don't give
too much away that's kind of like the
rough storyline but I really really like
it so I've actually got two of these
books to give away today so if you're
interested if you like reading and do
you want to read about the story which I
really like so far just comment in this
video below and just say yes I'd like to
win a book please and then i'll pick two
winners sorts of at random and i'll
