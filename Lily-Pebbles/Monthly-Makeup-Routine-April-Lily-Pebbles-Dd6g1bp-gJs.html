to be doing my monthly makeup tutorial
and I am gonna do the look with bluey
purple eyeliner that I wore in my makeup
bag collection video I said I was
thinking about doing it and then loads
of you commented saying yes please and
that you really liked it so thank you
and it is a really nice summary day
today think London finally has some Sun
sorry I always talk about the weather
it's a very English thing but I'm going
out later so this look would be perfect
for today I'm gonna start with an SPF
this is the Chanel SPF 50 because i
recently had laser on my face i would
always wear SPF anyway but it's
especially important when you have laser
you really have to do it so I'm just
gonna rub this on I really like this SPF
it's not at all sticky okay so for this
look with the eyeliner I like to have
quite perfected skin but then it's also
a summers day and I don't like wearing
too much makeup when you're out in the
sunshine comes feel like it may look
good on camera but when people look at
you in real life you just look like
you're only loads of makeup so I also
want to wear quite a nice light to Julie
bakes and for this I'm going to be using
the eve LOM tinted moisturizer I really
really like this and the makeup artist
that was on the very exclusive sheet
that I did said he's obsessed with these
which kind of made me like it even more
you know it has like approval off an
amazing makeup artist it comes in this
really great like squeezy chief so I'm
just gonna squeeze someone to the back
of my hand and then I'm going to start
working it in with my fingers but finish
blending out with a brush it's just it's
got quite nice like gel texture to
actually it's very easy to work into the
skin it feels really nice on the skin
and that smooths out the texture very
quickly I always leave tinted
moisturizers it's quite a nice to use
your fingers especially on a sunny day
really kind of stops it from City on top
of the skin are you shaved vanilla for
which is a very good match for me it was
quite hard to find the right color
though because there's quite a few which
is also good I'm just gonna keep
applying thin layers and just smooth it
down with my hands I think when it is a
bit warmer thin layers is the best way
to make your makeup last a bit longer
but i think i'm just going to leave it
there really like the gymnast of this
tinted moisturizer as you can see it's
not kind of full coverage you can still
see my skin and my blemishes it's just a
really nice base to start with and then
I like to use concealer just to cover
any other blemishes so obviously i'm
going to be using my
okay nature concealer which I'm obsessed
with I really need to get the lighter
color because this is a little bit dark
for me at the moment but again I'm just
going to put a thin layer and then work
on more layers from there just don't
want to look like I'm wearing too much
makeup by I'm gonna use a brush because
I find using my fingers for concealer
really tough messy and quite difficult
I'm just going to blend that in you've
seen me do this million times before
what I like to do around my eyes is
start with a brush but then working with
my fingers take it onto the lid slightly
I think this also just helps your
concealer from creasing if you really
work in with your fingers I just don't
look elegant when I do my makeup you
know some people do their makeup lisa
eldridge and she just looks so elegant I
basically just like slap my face around
I'm just gonna apply a tiny bit more
here I'm always a bit darker and then
just press that in with my brush now I
want to keep the doing pneus of the
makeup but i also want to set it in
certain areas just because it is so like
gooey and creamy that it can crease so
i'm going to use my hourglass ambient
lighting powder in diffused light
because these powders are so sheer and
lightweight there look powdery on the
skin at all and i'm also going to using
my new brush which is from RM k which is
the cheek brush but it's the perfect
size powder i think is so ridiculously
soft so just taking this bit of that
powder and i'm just going to apply it
under the eye and over the eye so i'm
just putting it where I need it on the
chin and slightly on the jaw line and
then the sides of the nose and the
center of the forehead okay now I want
to bronze up my skin because as you can
see everything just looks a little bit
flat and for this mobs using my seven
glory solar powder which you've seen me
as a million times before but I love it
my favorite bronzer I'm not really going
to contour with this I'm going to kind
of apply it just like a traditional
bronzer so across the forehead where the
Sun would normally hit my face across
the tops of the cheekbones I'd like to
take it down as well just even things
out may look like I'm applying a lot but
I'm not taking much on the brush and I'm
really blending it out okay I'm now
going to apply a blusher and because
I've got quite an intense blue I I'm not
going to put much blusher on and i went
to something quite light so i'm going to
use my hourglass blusher in diffused
heat which is really pretty look at this
source world it's quite highly
t as well for a cheaper alternative
though you can use the Max Factor cream
puff blush I think they're called this
one's lovely pink and they're pretty
much the same i'm just going to take
this one though and take a little bit on
my brush and apply it just some kind of
the tops of my cheekbones so as a little
flush of color or so is a bit of a
highlight as well but nothing to glitter
eggs again when i'm in the Sun I don't
like to look like a way too much makeup
I'm just going to fill in my brows with
that Anastasia brow Wiz nothing to her
baby but just filling in the front parts
and the arches filling in the arches
here I think makes all the difference
because that's kind of a thinner part of
my brows and i'm going to set those with
a clear brow gel ok so now on to the
eyes and because i'm wearing a bright
blue underneath the eye I don't like to
wear much on the top but I feel like I
need something just to balance out
because if I were to just wear the blue
eyeliner it all just looks a bit off so
i'm going to my trusty map palette and
I'm going to use patina which is just a
really easy light bronzy very
inoffensive easy to wear brown that I
always kind of go to it's this one here
and second one in so I'm just going to
take a fluffy brush and I'm just going
to apply that all over the lid very
lightly so as you can see it doesn't
really make much of a difference but it
just adds a little something to the lid
I don't know it makes me feel better I
don't like to wear nothing on my lids I
hardly ever I always have something on
my eyelids I'm very lightly dusting that
on see not much at all but then I am
going to take a brown eyeliner as well I
don't know why but it's something to do
evening it out I just feel better with
the little bit of eyeliner but nothing
too heavy i'm going to put this very
close to the lash line so it almost just
looks like my natural lashes this is Mac
Teddy which is a very dark brown and a
lovely eyeliner and I'm literally just
going to press it in right by the lashes
and I'm really really taking it from the
middle of the eye to the edge not right
to the inner corner and do the same on
the other eye which is always harder
because I have terrible eyesight in my
left eye not even pressing that hard I'm
just kind of tapping out on that's all
I'm going to do for the liner okay so
now for the star of the show the rest of
that is all very kind of normal you've
seen me do it before but this is the
eyeliner or eyeshadow from Kiko it's one
of their shadows sticks so they do cream
eye shadow sticks which are really good
and they're actually a great dupe for
the by Terry ombre
Black Stars this one isn't shade 31 and
it's unlike anything I've ever worn this
is very much a sort of color I would go
for my nails I love these kind of blue
purple periwinkle shades but I saw this
and I had a little voucher for Kiko so I
thought let's just give a go why not and
I love it it's just the most unique
color somewhere between blue and purple
and I think it goes really well with
brown eyes and I love it so it's quite a
big shadow stick but you can use it as a
liner as well so what I like to do is
just take that underneath the eye I
prefer wearing color under the eye
rather than over i'm not sure why it
might be sexy with my eye shape but do
whatever works for you you can use this
on the top as well so I I can't really
talk whilst doing this I'm going to rub
it really close to the lashes and take a
quite thick as well can you see like
instantly it's a cobalt electric blue
that's light purple tones these the ones
I've put a bit of that on I like to take
a small brush this is one of the zoeva
crease brushes and blend it out because
I don't want it to be harsh or going to
be quite soft blending it and pulling it
quite out on the side of the eye so it's
not that neat actually quite messy but
that's kind of the look i like and you
can add as much or as little as you like
but i think you should definitely it
should be noticeable because that's kind
of the whole point so i'm going to do
the other side if you take it too far up
you can just use your finger to blend it
out right I'm going to leave that there
and then what happens is because you're
blending is so close to the lashes and
smudging it out it kind of tints the
lower lashes which I think does it quite
cool you can leave it like that but I'm
going to take a little bit of my clinic
lower lash mascara and I don't want to
have long lower lashes but i'm just
going to slightly kind of tintin them
back to black a little bit i'm just
going to quickly curl my lashes with my
schumer of eyelash curlers I don't do
them for that long because i'm really
lazy i ha 12 to wait and today i'm going
to use a waterproof mascara i haven't
really got any good waterproof mascara i
really need to try that fairy drops one
that anna loves i keep forgetting to get
it this one's from maybelline it's the
rocket and it's the waterproof one
because it's sunny and i know i'm going
to go out late it and wear sunglasses
and they don't know what theory is but
when i wear sunglasses my makeup just
disappears so I'm hoping that this will
make it stay a little bit longer I'm
just going to apply a little bit of that
top lashes not too much this is still
like a daytime look
I don't want anything crazy on my lashes
this gives quite nice feathery lashes
whether i think there's no scar is quite
old so it may have dried out a bit okay
so that is the eyes done for my lips I'm
going to use this which I don't know why
I haven't used this in a video before I
think it's just because it's been living
in my handbag and it's from bite beauty
bite beauty lab however what it's called
bite beauty I think a guy from Sephora
and it's in the shade amaretto it's one
of their lik like a creamy lip pencil
and I got this in a nude shade because
because it's creamy I don't want to get
a bright color ashion glad i got this
it's a really lovely nude so they take
this all over the lips just a bit like a
liner because i know it will kind of set
and stay in place so I'm just taking
that all over it's like a peachy nude so
although it's creamy it does still look
a little bit maps so what I like to do
is then just tap little bit of lip balm
on top this is the by Terry bombed arose
which has a nice kind of pinky tint to
it I'm just going to dab a bit of that
on top because it's a summary look I
want to have moisturize lips but the
liner underneath will make it last
longer so that's it that is the finished
look bluey eyeliner nude lips bit of
bronze it's really kind of I wanted to
keep everything quite simple on the face
and lips and everything is just about
the blue I think that is kind of the
whole point of this look and I hope
these aren't getting boring for you

camera for you guys but a lot of you
