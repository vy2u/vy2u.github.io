monthly makeup routine went down so well
and you guys seemed to enjoy me just
kind of sitting and do my makeup and
chatting to you I thought I would
continue the little kind of monthly
series and today I'm gonna do a look
which I've been wearing a lot recently
because I've been wearing it during our
Peter chat live tour so if you came to
any of the events you might recognize
the makeup look but I am gonna switch it
up a bit when it comes to the lips as I
mentioned in the last video this is
gonna get a little bit repetitive
because I think my base is always gonna
stay quite similar my bronze and contour
but I'm going to try and switch up the
eyes and lips every month sorry for this
dark space over here I really need to
get another light but I'm gonna get
started and I'm just gonna sit do my
makeup and chat you guys through it I've
been wearing my NARS sheer glow
foundation almost every day this month
especially June beauty chat live just
because I know it's a foundation I trust
I know this shade suits me it's just the
perfect mix of good coverage and still
that kind of jewy glowy skin it's
definitely one of my all-time favorite
foundations and one that a lot of you
guys were actually buying when you came
to beauty chat live a lot of people I
spoke to said they had this on their
wish list so I'm just gonna buff that in
with my Bobbi Brown full coverage face
brush unlike the other nas foundation
that I spoke about in my last video my
last like new board Beauty launches
video this one doesn't sit on top of the
skin it really blends in nicely but it
does take a little bit longer to blend
it all in so I like to take my time and
just keep buffing in circular motions
once that's all bashed into the skin it
leaves a really nice kind of glowy
finish and I think it's got good
coverage but it still looks quite
natural because my skin defi doesn't
look perfect you can still see some kind
of red patches and you still see my kind
of moles coming through oh damn I forgot
to mention that I've been using
Charlotte Tilbury magic cream quite a
lot recently I was gonna put down first
but I completely forgot I have a little
sample that got last year and I quite
liked it actually it's quite nice it
just before you put your foundation on
just because that adds that kind of
layer of hydration I think the
foundation sticks really nice on top of
it so I was gonna mention that but I
forgot but concealer I'm gonna use the
Urban Decay Naked skin that concealer
that I used in my new beauty launches
video I've really been loving this but
I've learnt to take some of the product
off the wand before I apply but just one
dip is enough
for the entire face which is really
great I just put a little bit of my chin
around my nose down my nose and under my
eyes it just holds so much product on
this wand you can literally do your
whole face with one dip which is great
I've still got this weird rash up here
from flying it's never gonna go and then
I'm gonna blend it in with my Real
Techniques setting brush that I always
use there's such a nice concealer I'm
really happy I found another one I like
because I'm quite fussy with concealers
and the NARS one is the only one I've
ever really likes but this is great I
really enjoyed this concealer if you're
worried about creasing I sometimes like
to blend it in with my fingers a little
bit just around the eye area okay so for
bronzer I'm going to use the new Kiko
one and when I was on tour I was using
soap &amp;amp; Glory solar powder but I think
this is quite similar and I like to use
new products when I can this just gives
an all-over
kind of warmth before I go in with my
contour you guys have seen this all
before but after warming up the face a
bit I do like to use a bit of contour
and I took this palette with me on tour
and it was so handy I love it it's a
Charlotte Tilbury film-star bronze &amp;amp;
Glow of course and I'm gonna use the
matching brush to go with it I'm just
using the contour shade just to bring
out my cheekbones use in a very light
hand because easier to build up products
then take you away sorry if this is
repetitive any of you but there will be
some new viewers and overall look will
be slightly different at the end so I'm
just taking that on that other cheekbone
I'm also gonna use the highlight shade
which I absolutely love on the tops of
my cheekbones for blusher I took with me
Naz deep throat and it was a bit of a
last minute panic I didn't know which
blusher to take but I knew I was gonna
be doing quite a lot with my eyes and
lips so I just wanted like a basic easy
blusher that I knew suited my skin tone
and deep throat is always been a
favorite of mine as you can see I've
like hit to the bottom of the products
which is quite exciting when that
happens because even you know it's
really well loved it's gonna pop a bit
of that I just dipped my brush in once
and I'm gonna use that for both cheeks
because I don't want too much blush for
this look just enough that I look
healthy still years on my favorite
all-time blush such a good brush a shade
okay I'm just gonna sort out my brows
which actually really need threading
again I think it's been six
since my last session can you see on my
eyelids that the concealers bunched up
this often happens to me I think it's
because I've got quite heavy lids and so
I always makes sure to just blend it in
with my finger before I do my eyeshadow
ok eyeshadow time and I'm gonna be using
the by Terry Umbra black star in misty
rock I absolutely love this you guys
love it
athletes at life everyone was buying
this it was so funny whenever store it
sold out everyone was so upset this was
definitely one of the most kind of
purchased items during the tour it's
just so easy I can use this by itself I
don't need like four i shadow will blend
it together I can just use this all over
the lid and under the eye and it looks
amazing it's like a perfectly shade but
because it has that silver pigment in it
it makes your lids almost look wet and
glossy which i think is so so beautiful
Tanya burr got me into this and I will
be forever thankful so I like to just
pack it on to the kind of bottom part of
the lid quite heavy and then I take a
blending brush and then blend it out and
the reason I keep it quite low is so
that I have space to blend because I
haven't got the biggest eyelids so I
give myself that space to blend out and
I can always add more if I need it so
now I've blended out the edge I can see
that I would like a little bit more
higher up so I'm gonna add some of that
such a gorgeous shade and I always get
compliments when I wear this as well
blend out the edges just keep blending
and you can get to know the shape of
your eyes some people like to blend
further out that way I also like to take
that quite thickly under the eye as well
and then I'm gonna use the new Real
Techniques brush this is quite good on
for under the eye but this is why I love
miss you up because you just put on the
top and underneath and you're kind of
done you really don't need any other
shadows it really catches the light and
I just think it's gorgeous so I'm gonna
do the other eye now so the shadow is
done it's amazing this one little stick
does all of that I think it's a genius
product and for beauty chat live I think
I wore black liquid eyeliner every night
just because I knew it was gonna last we
were there from like 5 until 10 so I
needed makeup that was gonna last the
whole evening I think I took with me the
Kat Von D tattoo liner but I used that
in last month's look so I'm going to use
the Tom Ford defining eye pen which is
still one of my favorites
I only ever use the long side and I
think this is a great eyeliner see if I
can do it on camera this but it's always
tricky with one hand but I like to have
a thicker line on the outside and then
going into sort of the center I find if
I go too far into my eye it kind of
gathers just sort of center of my eye
shape so I tend to do a thicker thinner
in the inside and not go right the
inside right I can't do this on camera
so I'm gonna go do it in the mirror and
I'll be back okay I'm back sorry it's
really hard when you have terrible
eyesight because I need to be greedy
close to a mirror but that's the
eyeliner look that I've done so thin
that's slightly thicker and then I've
extended it a little bit I don't know if
they're perfectly even but that's the
best that I could do today and while so
you're gonna use some eyelash curlers I
have my show mirror one they're so good
so I'm gonna just curl my lashes and
I've really been enjoying doing this
recently I think it really helps kind of
keep your curl longer the mascara I she
took with me was the Tarte gifted
mascara but I feel like you guys have
seen me use this quite a lot recently so
I'm gonna have to try something new
which I got this morning I've never
tried the Too Faced better than sex
mascara ridiculous name but a lot of
people love this and it's kind of if I
got really heavy packaging and the brush
is huge and like really hairy it's like
an hourglass shape so I thought I'd try
it I have never tried this before so I'm
gonna just give this a go and let you
know what I think it was a very wet to
mascara you know when you apply mascara
and it instantly add like a lot of
product
oh I like that yeah it's a really nice
mascara it's good for a night out it's a
very like dramatic mascara he has made
my lashes look very thick actually it
gives really good volume the brush is a
little bit big though I find it's not
the easiest brush to use like it just
got it on my cheek that's really
annoying I like the results though I
think it looks it's good for like a
night out I probably wouldn't use it
every day I'm gonna use the Clinique
bottom lash mascara as well because this
was an evening event so my makeup was
quite evening appropriate and during the
tour I took three lip products with me
one for each night I wore the Sephora
lip cream in always red on the first
night and then I will the Kat Von D
everlasting lipstick and bachelorettes
which is like a bright pink and then I
wore the Charlotte Tilbury
mattes revolution lipstick in red carpet
red now kind of looking
the look and the eyes are quite pinky
and perfectly I think instead of pairing
it with a red lip it will be nice to
pair it with a really dark kind of berry
lip so I brought down from my bedroom
the Mac lip liner in vino and the MAC
lipstick in rebel which I never really
figure out how to wear a rebel it always
kind of goes a little bit drying on me
but let's see with the pencil if these
work well together
I think rebel is a bit more of a more
pink than vino but let's try it really
just line my lips first as you have my
makeup done and the other day and a
makeup artist put the lipstick on and
then line to the lips which I thought
was really interesting he said he's
always done it that way I'm gonna stick
to what I know and line the lips first
this is a gorgeous deep berry purple
color and when I line my lips I always
take it right to the edge so when you
relax your lips you can see where the
edges I also find when you line your
lips better to fill in quite a lot of
the lip as well because then when your
lipstick does fade you're not left with
like kind of 90s line around your lips
so this has already clinging to my dried
pits on my lips so let's see if it works
or not like to draw a might keep its bow
see it's gone darker where I have dry
parts on my lips but they're not even
that dry at the moment I do find them
Mac products do that and it's bit
annoying so I've lined the lips with
vino and I'm just gonna take rebel
lipstick and apply that on top let's see
what happens see my top lip is okay but
the bottom lip just looks so dry I don't
if you can see from there but close up
it just makes my lipstick so dry I think
the charlotte tilbury matte revolution
lipsticks are the best that I've tried
they don't dry on my lips at all so I
might invest in Glastonbury because I've
seen a few people wear that shade it's
very similar to this it's very pretty
yeah I mean it's a bit disappointed with
the lips but I think they do match the
eyes so popping them looking dry I think
the overall look is what I wanted to
achieve and I really like it so let me
know what you think of the finished look
and I hope you enjoyed this kind of
relaxed chatty makeup video I just love
putting on makeup and talking about it
so I hope you enjoy watching it I'll see
you guys in my next video and thanks for
watching
