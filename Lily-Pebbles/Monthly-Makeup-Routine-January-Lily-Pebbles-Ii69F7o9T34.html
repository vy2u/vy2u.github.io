today's video I'm going to be doing a
kind of casual makeup tutorial type
thing I thought I might start doing
these monthly if you want to just
showing you what my current favorite
everyday makeup is I'm always talking
about the products I love I'm not always
showing them so you guys really like the
tutorial I did during vlogmas so I
thought I'd start doing these as a
monthly thing if you want me to let me
know for today's look I thought show you
quite a few of the products I showed in
my January haul video a lot of them were
Kiko and you guys commented saying you
wanted to see what they look like on so
as well as some blog post reviews I'm
also going to show you in this video
what they look like when I actually
applied them so keep watching if you
want to see how I did this makeup look
and also just a warning these makeup
videos will obviously be quite simple
they're just my everyday makeup look I'm
no makeup artist but I really hope you
guys enjoy it anyway and now I'm gonna
cut to me wearing no makeup and I'll
start from there okay so let me tuck my
hair behind my ears and I'm sorry if the
settings on the camera aren't perfect
I'm playing around with different
settings it's very hard to get the color
right for makeup tutorials so that the
colors I'm using actually match what
they really are in real life but I'm
trying out a new setting so let me know
if you guys like this or if you don't
I'm gonna start by using the new Kiko
foundation this is the universal fit
hydrating foundation and I have
absolutely fallen in love with this
foundation Kiko say it's got this
pliable elasticated formula which I
completely agree with them it's like a
medium to full coverage but when you
blend it in it feels like a light
foundation so it actually covers but
look how quickly it blends in it's kind
of strange but I really really like it
it covers enough for I need but then
also is hydrating which is great for my
kind of drier skin and it still lets
your natural skin shine through so it
doesn't look too heavy so I'm just using
the Bobbi Brown full coverage brush just
to buff that in I always make sure to go
down onto my neck oh man I really need
to pluck my eyebrows apologies for the
brows
okay so foundation done I'm now going to
use the Kiko natural concealer which I
also bought in that haul video this
comes in the ten years
tiniest packaging I think I will
literally run out in like five minutes
but it's really affordable and I really
like it it reminds me of the NARS creamy
radiant concealer which I use almost
every day has the same kind of dough for
applicator it's very moisturizing it's
not kind of drying so I'm just applying
that in all the usual places where I
apply my concealer and then using my
Real Techniques setting brush which I
absolutely love to concealer the perfect
size I just buff that in to the skin I'm
a little bit naughty with the concealer
I get into a bit of a habit of just
putting it in the same places and I kind
of put it there even if I don't need it
but I usually get quite dark circles
under my eyes and I get quite red around
my nose so I just focus it there I
sometimes take it over my lid as well I
do have quite dark eyelids I don't like
to take too much because it does crease
but a little bit it's quite good it
works a bit like a primer for eyeshadow
I have a bit paranoia about dark circles
you guys probably can't even see them
but I always like to put a little bit
extra just there and then I just Pat it
in instead of blending because then it
kind of covers better this brush is so
good especially for under the eyes
because it just fits right there where
you need it to okay so now I'm going to
use a little bit of powder because both
the foundation and concealer very
moisturizing which means that you get
lovely glowy dewy skin but it also means
that it's quite kind of wet and if you
want your makeup to last it's good to
set it all in place so I'm gonna be
using my borscht or our healthy balance
powder which I have really been enjoying
I have the shade vanilla it hardly is a
shade though it's pretty much
translucent and I'm using my arm kay
brush although I want to get another
Bobbi Brown
sheer powder brush that I use of brot
blusher because I think that's really
nice for powder so I'm going to take a
little bit go under my eyes and on my
chin and then a little bit on my
forehead those are kind of the usual
places I don't put too much on my cheek
area because I like that to be quite
glowy okay so now I need to bronze up my
face a bit and I know it's quite strange
to bronze and contour but I find that
contours quite cool and I need a little
bit of warming up so I'm gonna take this
nice big fluffy Hakuhodo brush that I
got that I mattes a few years ago is so
soft I was using it for blusher before
but then I've started using it for
bronzer and it's so nice
I just put my bronzer in a three shape
on
outer parts of my face and you can see
that it instantly just warms everything
up take it down into my neck a little
bit just so my face doesn't end up
darker than my neck and slightly down my
nose as well if you want more of a kind
of summer sunkissed look you can take it
over your cheeks over your nose and over
the other cheek this is a bit more kind
of sculpted but in the summer I really
like taking it all the way up my nose so
now using my charlotte tilbury film-star
bronze &amp;amp; Glow kit and their matching
brush i'm going to contour and highlight
i use this one pretty much every day
just because it kind of does the job i
don't need to try any others I just put
this kind of in the Triangle there into
the contours of my face quite lightly I
don't always contour but when I'm
filming I do because it really adds a
nice kind of definition to the shape of
my face take up onto the temples nothing
too harsh very light hand just gives me
a bit more cheekbone action and then
with this zoeva brush which is the 105
luxe highlight I'm taking the lovely
creamy highlight shade and just putting
it to the tops of my cheekbones you
don't want to go too far down because it
will give you shiny cheeks but just on
the top it will catch the light really
nicely for blusher I'm going to be using
the new Chanel blush that's coming out
in their January spring/summer
collection this is amazing and it has
them as beautiful kind of floral
embossing this is the best thing from
their new collection it's so nice it's
just a really easy rosy everyday pink
I'm using my Bobbi Brown share powder
blush brush and just patting it onto the
apples of my cheeks it's very subtle
pretty it's actually quite easy to build
up though if you do want something a bit
more pink I'm just gonna add a little
bit I can always go back and add more
later once I've done the eyes but the
eyes and lips are quite pink so I don't
want to overdo it okay so now I can go
onto brows you guys have seen me do this
a million times this is about Anastasia
brow Wiz and I like to just brush them
through and fill in the gaps I'm lucky I
don't need to do that much to my brows
but I do like to fill in the gaps just
so they look a little bit more kind of
tidy and neat I'm also gonna use the
anastagia clear brow gel which is
something I have to use every single day
otherwise my brows just fly all over the
place okay so now onto the eyes and I'm
going to be using the two Keiko
eyeshadows that I bought from that haul
220 which is a gorgeous light pinky
shimmer
and 233 which is a darker cranberry
purple I absolutely love these shadows
as I said I didn't have a palette for
them so they're a bit fiddly but I'm
just going to take this lighter pink
shade and put it all over the lid it's a
pink with a lot of gold shimmer in it so
it really catches the lights and it's so
pretty
just taking a fluffy brush this is the
two-two-one from zoeva zoeva also ever
I've heard people say but look how nice
this shade is it has that real gold hint
to it I love gold on the eyes if you
struggle to wear pink I think this is a
really easy way to do it I'm also gonna
take that on the other lid and then
going to take the other eye shadow
they're kind of cranberry dark purple
and this eye look is really easy because
it just uses two shades I'm going to
take a tiny bit of that to start because
as I said it's harder to take away than
it is to add so I'm going to take a tiny
bit of that right into the outer corner
of the eye start right in the corner and
then blend into the center of the eye I
think this kind of purply shade goes
really nicely with the pink and then I'm
going to do the same on the other eye
right into the corner little circular
motions and then bring it into the
middle of the eye I forgot to bring down
my clean blending brush but now what I
would normally do just gonna take off
his back of my hand is use a cleaner
brush just to kind of blend that out but
I'm gonna use a mix of the brush I have
and my finger just to make sure that
line is really soft and then taking a
smaller brush this is the zoeva 231
which I really like to use under the eye
even though it's quite large I'm taking
that darker purple started from the
outside underneath if you start from the
outside then that's when you use most
the product so by the time you get to
the inside of the eye there won't be
that much product on the brush okay so
that's the shadow done and now I'm gonna
do some liquid eyeliner which is always
very hard to show on camera because I
need to get really close to a mirror and
normally use two hands but I'm gonna try
my best to do it one-handed and holding
the mirror in the other hand I'm using
the Kat Von D tattoo liner which I
really like I've done a blog post on my
top three eyeliners I donno if it's gone
up yet but if it has I will link it down
below
I like the eyeliners that have kind of
calligraphy type of pens so not felt
it's more of a brush it makes it really
easy to apply because it carries a lot
of liquid in it and I like to use my
eyeliners on
the side I'd also say when you're buying
a liquid eyeliner no capital ones that
have like a bouncing lid like this
because that stops the product and
drying out I personally think it's worth
investing in a good liquid eyeliner if
you use it a lot and I'll show you how I
do my liquid eyeliner because I like to
use the brush on its side and I start
from the outside and I just do from the
outside to the middle I don't try and do
any fancy flick at first just keeping
things as close to the lash line as
possible so I'm going to use my little
finger to rest on my cheek and then just
draw a really thin line close to the
lashes using the side of the brush I
usually stop around just kind of before
the center of the eye and because I have
quite too small eyes I don't go right
into the middle so as you can see the
line I've done now is kind of thicker in
the middle so it's given me a droopy eye
so now I need to build out the outer
part of the line just take the time I
think that's key so that alone I think
it's quite a nice line it's quite simple
if you don't want to do a fancy flick I
think I'm gonna slightly flick it but
nothing too drastic I think I might
leave it there because I quite like the
look of that line now I just have to
make the other eye look the same which
is always quite difficult again I'm
gonna lean on my face with my little
finger I like to leave my eyes kind of
open and I just look down a mirror
I really think using the side of the
brush rather than doing it straight on
is so much easier then keep looking
straight ahead so you can see how they
compare also know when to stop I always
think if you keep going back to try and
perfect it you're gonna end up messing
it up so you know I might leave it there
they're not identical but they're
sisters not twins
so now because I'm doing quite a nude
lip and nothing too crazy I want to
really make my lashes look thick and
long and voluminous so I'm going to do a
few lot tricks to help with that first
of all I'm gonna line the upper lash
line with a black kohl eyeliner I don't
tend to wear a black hole on the inside
because it shrinks my eyes but on the
top I think it really helps make your
lashes look thicker this one's from
Charlotte Tilbury her rockin Kohl liners
are really soft which is great for that
upper lash line because it hurts I think
if you get one it's too Scratchy
I have no idea how to do this with one
hand let's see if I can just do it
normally I would hold my eye up and do
it I'm just going to try and go from
wondering
it just takes away the skin color that
you can see kind of seeping through your
lashes okay the next thing I'm gonna do
to make my lashes look thicker and
longer is use a lash curler are used to
only use these on special occasions but
recently I've been using them a lot
because my lashes have just not been
doing what I wanted to do and this
really helps kind of prep them for your
mascara so you just get your lashes
carefully put them inside once you've
felt that you haven't got your eyelid in
there squeeze really tight just for a
few seconds and release these ones are
from sure mirror which I think are the
best lash curlers Charlotte Tilbury also
do some good ones but if you just want
to give it a go go for drugstore one and
although I think these ones do last a
long time that's why they're kind of
worth the investment
okay mascara time I'm gonna use the
l'oreal false lash telescopic which is
again the one i bought in a whole video
kind of funny brush but if you take your
time applying it it gives really nice
kind of length the lashes and separates
them nicely definitely no clomping
clomping clomping but really slowly so
it's almost like brushing the lashes
okay that's mascara done so now it's the
final bit lips and i'm gonna do a nice
kind of soft
pinky lip and to start I'm going to use
the Revlon lip butter in sweet tart
which if you layer it on quite thick it
can be a really really bright pink but
I'm just gonna Pat it on these are
really kind of moisturizing I like the
shakes I think it's really brightening
as well so I'm going to Pat it on and
then kind of rub it in almost like a lip
balm and then on top of that I'm using
one of the Tanya burr lip glosses this
one is lunch date which i think is a new
shade and it's really kind of nice nude
so I'm going to put that in top just to
kind of mute it down a bit
the tiny bear lipgloss is a really
pigmented so you don't put much on and
once you do I think it's nice to kind of
Pat it in let it sink into the lips of
it because it can go on a bit too thick
so that's the finished makeup look I
hope you like it a kind of pink golden
shimmery eye with a black eyeliner flick
and pink lips this is the look that I've
been loving this month so let me know if
you enjoyed this other video and if you
want to see them monthly
and let me know what you thought of the
settings as well because I'm a bit of a
camera geek and I'd be interested to
know if you guys liked it or not
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
