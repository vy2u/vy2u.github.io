June monthly makeup routine so I do
these videos every month just showing
you the makeup that I've been loving
wearing at the moment this month I've
been loving glowy fresh skin bright eyes
and a bit of a red lip here in there so
that's the look I'm gonna be doing for
you today and I'm just gonna get started
a lot of the products I'm using are
high-end so I've taken out a load of
drugstore alternatives to recommend
along the way but I want to actually use
the products that I've been using which
most of them are high-end so I'm going
to start off with my base and this is a
bit of a ridiculous
overpriced mix but I have been loving it
so I'm definitely on the hunt for some
drugstore alternatives if you guys know
of any I'm mixing together chanel LePage
all-in-one healthy glow fluid which is
like a bronzing liquid a few different
brands have these and the tomforde
illuminating primer which is like a
glowy primer I like to put a big pump of
the as you cut two pumps of the
highlighting liquid and then a small
squirt of the bronzing liquid and this
is quite bronzy actually so you don't
need that much but I feel like this
gives such a nice like bronzy glowy base
to the skin so I'm just gonna put that
all over the skin and I absolutely love
the look it gives to the skin so fresh
and glowy and a slight hint of town as
well I have been turning my body
recently so this is all makes my face
match because I don't like to turn my
face for some reason I don't know why he
never looks natural I'm just rubbing
that all in blending it down the neck
this tomforde
illuminating primer is the best I've
tried it's even better than the Laura
Mercier one I really really like it just
adds an instant glow to your skin if you
feel like your skin's a little bit dull
this primer will definitely help with
that okay so that's the base done and
now I'm going to use my NARS sheer glow
foundation which I've been getting back
into recently this is kind of a light to
medium coverage but it definitely has
the glow factor it really amps up the
glow on my skin and I love the finish a
good alternative to this one would be
the bourgeois happy light foundation
which is actually very similar a little
bit lighter in coverage but a really
pretty foundation I'm just gonna buff
this in with the Bobbi Brown full
coverage face brush I'm still loving
this brush although it really doesn't
wash
well which is very annoying any of you
guys have this brush and you found a
better way to wash it then how I usually
do under the sink because I feel like it
just stays wet for so long and it
changes the texture of the brush I'm
just going to buff that into the skin
blends in really quickly I've either
been using this month the NARS sheer
glow or the Charlotte Tilbury light
Wonder Foundation they've both been
favorites of mine this month that's kind
of what it looks like on the skin so
still have that kind of glow fresh dewy
look to the skin I'm gonna do concealer
and I'm going to use this Charlotte
Tilbury retouch which I've been loving
for under my eyes so I'm just going to
give that kind of one twist and then
apply a strip under my eyes I've been
trying not to go too far in the inner
corner I always make that mistake and
then it bunches up on my eyelid so I've
been trying to get out of that habit and
I'm gonna blend that in using their Real
Techniques setting brush which I love
for concealer with this concealer I like
to just kind of tap it on because it's
quite sheer so I feel like you get
better coverage if you blend with a
lighter hand it's so brightening now I
love this for under the eyes I feel like
this is good for dark circles but if you
have really dark purple or blue under
your eye then I would recommend the
Bobbi Brown corrector or any kind of
peachy tone concealer if you want a jogs
to alternative concealer I'd recommend
the Revlon Colorstay concealer I think
this is a really nice kind of jewy fresh
concealer so that's my under eyes and
for my face I'm going to use the Clarins
instant concealer I feel like the
Charlotte Tilbury want is a little bit
too brightening for the face sometimes
so just gonna take its Halle Mao this is
so pigmented you hardly need any product
and just take a little bit on my chin a
little bit around my nose a little bit
on the tip of my nose and then I'm also
gonna take a tiny bit just under my eye
this concealer is great and you can use
it alone without foundation if you have
pretty good skin this works really
nicely as like a quite like a foundation
concealer as I would call it you can
just use it on the areas where you need
it is that a filling foundation all over
your skin okay so the skin is done as
you can see it does look very jewy and
glowy which is lovely I really love that
look but because I want my makeup to
last all day I'm gonna set it just in a
few places I'm gonna use the hourglass
diffuse
light because I love this is a really
really lightweight powder and it's
lightly yellowy which works for my skin
a good drugstore turns it would be the
bourgeois healthy balance powder which
is also very lightweight and looks
really nice and undetectable on the skin
I'm just gonna place it on my chin very
lightly just around my nose in the
center of my forehead and under the eyes
that's the only place I'm gonna set it
because I really like the gymnast on my
cheeks and everywhere else okay for
bronzer I'm gonna use the new bronzer
from hourglass this is luminous bronze
light they have two new bronzers it
looks very similar to their ambient
lighting blushes which I absolutely love
I tried these in store and loved them
and then when I tried this at home it
was a very muddy dark brown color and I
wasn't sure it suited me and I kind of
gave up on it a bit but then I realized
I could probably use a lighter brush
like this Mac one eight eight so it's
like a duo fiber brush that applies a
lot less product and I feel like with
this you just have to take your time and
not overdo it it won't be good if you
have really pale skin because it is
quite dark but if you do have slightly
darker skin than me I think this is a
really lovely bronzer a nice drugstore
bronzer is the Kiko masterpiece bronzer
in forwards Sienna that's a really
lovely pretty bronzer so I'm just gonna
take some of this hourglass bronze I
take off in the back of my hand first
and then very lightly in circular
motions I'm just gonna apply it so the
outer part of the face this is very
time-consuming but it's such a nice bun
so I wanted to find a way to be able to
use it cuz it's just a bit too dark for
me when I use a proper bronzer brush I
still haven't decided how I feel about
this product I'm just gonna keep
blending it
hopefully they'll bring out one there's
a little bit lighter because that would
be perfect for me I know there is a
darker one and a lighter one after two
I'm not sure if this is the dark or a
lighter one its luminous bronze light so
I'm guessing it's light it can be done
though I think that's quite a nice
bronze not too much but it definitely
makes a nice change to the face for a
highlighter I'm going to use a new one
that I bought from Kevyn Aucoin and this
is starlight so I have the candle light
one which is a gorgeous kind of
champagne e gold this one's a bit more
pink which is a bit different for me but
I think it's so so pretty and I've been
using it as an eye shadow as well which
is really nice so I'm just gonna take a
little bit on my brush and just add it
to the tops of my cheekbones and only if
you can see that but it's just
really pretty pinkie highlighter mine's
a bit of Mac all that glitters I shadow
I think it's really nice and if you've
got a little bit left on the brush you
take it down the center of the nose a
good drugstore alternative for that
would be the soap and glory glow all out
which is another kind of pinky highlight
it's not as highlight E but this is nice
actually for like all over the cheeks
for blusher I'm going to use one of the
Max Factor blushes which I absolutely
love these are a really good cheap for
the hourglass ambient lighting blush
this is in the shade alluring rose it's
kind of an interesting like movie rosy
shade but it kind of goes with the whole
bronze look so I'm just gonna add a
little bit of that to my cheeks
I love these blushes I think they're so
pretty okay now onto my brows and of
course I'm gonna use my Anastasia brow
Wiz I've actually run out of this though
I didn't realize I thought it's just
broken but I've literally come to the
end there's a tiny bit left the soap and
glory artery will also do as a drugstore
alternative there's less colors
available in a slightly warmer but don't
be afraid to use the blonde one if you
have brown brows because it works just
as well just filling in a few sections
of my brows and then I've also run out
of my Anastasia clear brow gel I'm gonna
have to make a big cult beauty order
soon so I'm gonna use this one from Dior
which is the brows Tyler gel I really
like the idea you open it and wind it up
in the gel kind of comes through the
brush but I don't find it works as well
is like a standard clear brow gel so I'm
using this at the moment but I'm gonna
go back to my Anastasia clear brow gel
okay for eyeshadow i'm gonna use this
palette from l'oreal it's the lapel it
nude i haven't bought the new one
because i really like this one it's got
everything I need in it it's got a
really nice mix of Rosie topi plummy
shades and it's so so pretty I'm gonna
just take fluffy brush and I'm gonna
take the shade right in the center which
is a really nice light pink slightly
peachy actually blend in my concealer
which always creases on my lid I'm just
gonna apply that all over the lid I'm
gonna take a little bit more of that
it's so pretty it's quite share though
so you can layer it up and then I'm
gonna take the shade two shades up which
is like I think it's a matte lie lucky
plum and apply that in the outer corner
I really love plummy shades on my eyes I
think goes really nicely with brown eyes
and then I'm gonna take that plummy
shade under the eye as well I'm just
applying it very lightly because I don't
want anything too heavy for this look
okay I'm also going to use my little
finger on the shade that's right at the
beginning and use that as an inner
corner highlights I think that really
opens and brightens up your eyes and
looks so pretty in the summer I'm just
gonna dab it very lightly on the inner
corner and I love what that does for the
eyes I'm not gonna use any eyeliner on
the top which is quite different for me
because I think that sometimes when you
just use mascara it looks so fresh and
summery and especially with a red lip
you don't want it to be too heavy I'm
gonna use the Charlotte Tilbury rock and
coal liners good drugstore alternative
would be the Rimmel scandaleyes and I'm
gonna use a nude on the waterline and a
black on the inside of the top and that
just makes your lashes look a little bit
thicker so if you are just very mascara
it looks really chic and very Parisian I
thinks I'm gonna use the nude color
first just in the waterline this can
sometimes look a bit weird but also I
think it really opens up the eyes
especially if you're tired and you have
a lot of redness and this can really
help always expect weird at first but if
you just blend it in and after a while
it kind of chills out and then I'm gonna
apply the black on the inside top of the
eye so I just lift the eye up and apply
it inside I don't think I'm gonna be
able to do this on camera because I need
a mirror and I need a hand be right back
okay now because I'm not wearing any eye
line on top I like to wear a lot of
mascara and have really thick long
fluttery lashes I'm gonna use the Too
Faced better than sex mascara which I
absolutely love especially when I'm
going down in the evening I'm just gonna
apply a few layers of this it makes my
lashes look so thick and amazing can you
see the difference now between the two
lashes this is such a good mascara
I'm not going to apply any to the bottom
lashes cuz I think it might be a little
bit too much but then the last step is
just to do my lipstick and for this I'm
going to use the Clinique poppy pop
lipstick which is a really pretty it's
like a red with slightly pinky coral
undertones so it's very fresh it's a
good daytime red because some Reds I
find if they're too dark or too classic
red I find it a bit hard to wear
during the day a good jocks alternative
would be the rimmel in love with ginger
which is slightly more orange but again
a really pretty
daytime red lip neither of these are
matte but they're also quite
long-lasting and they're like
moisturizing very easy to wear and I'm
gonna use a lip brush to apply this
because I feel like you get more
precision around the edges and you can
really work it into your lips so I think
it gives a more natural finish and it
lasts longer so I'm just going to start
by going around the edge this lip
brushes from Kiko I love it it's like a
retractable one going back and forth
really working it into the lips these
lipsticks are so comfortable to wear
they're really hydrating and I love them
well so if you use a lip brush you can
really draw in your Cupid's bow if you
don't have a very prominent one like me
and then at the end I like to apply it
straight from the bullet just a little
bit okay so lipstick done that is the
finished look fresh glowy skin very
minimal eyes but quite a lot of mascara
and a fresh daytime slightly pinky red
lip let me know what you think of this
look and if you try it out yourself
