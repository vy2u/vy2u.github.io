another monthly makeup routine if you
already subscribe to my channel then
you'll know what this is all about but
if you are new hello welcome I do these
videos every month and I'm basically
just running through a makeup routine
that I'm loving at the moment they're
normally very simple nothing too fancy
or special just the makeup I like
wearing but she's saying that this month
there is a little bit of color on the
eyes which is exciting if you are new
don't forget to subscribe it's free and
then you will know when I upload new
videos which is three times a week
Tuesdays Thursdays and Sundays right
enough of the waffle I'm gonna get into
the makeup routine I am barefaced and
I'm gonna start with a serum this is
from Chanel in it's the Hydra Beauty
micro serum I haven't been using this
loads but I went to a Chanel launch
yesterday and Mary Greenwell who is an
amazing makeup artists use this before
every single makeup look and it just
added such a boost of hydration on this
the models skin instantly looked so
glowy and fresh Mary green was hilarious
she basically she doesn't use any
brushes and she just like slaps the
models faces to get everything on but it
works I think it really kind of makes
the circulation and just their skin just
looks so glowing so it's a very like wet
serum which makes it really nice as a
base under foundation
okay so serum on and I'm now gonna use a
foundation this is the Burberry fresh
glow foundation I've been using this all
month I think if you look in the
description boxes of my videos where I
always list what I'm wearing or what I'm
talking about this is pretty much being
the foundation I've worn in every single
video it's got really decent coverage
but it has still got that kind of glow
and freshness to it and then I like to
use my Bobbi Brown buffing brush to buff
it right into the skin it doesn't take
that long to blend in it tend to focus
my foundation around the nose kind of
this part of the cheek area and chin so
that's the foundation done I would
seriously recommend this Burberry
foundation and now we need concealer I'm
still obsessed with that open 2k1
this is pretty much taken over from the
NARS concealer they're very similar but
the packaging on this is just so much
better and easier to use I really really
love it so I just use the applicator to
apply a bit under my eyes I like to put
in the corners as well because I have a
darkness there around my nose where I
have redness a bit on my nose and on my
where I have these annoying spots
they're like under the skin and won't
come out I'm just gonna blend this in
using my Real Techniques setting brush
which is the best brush for concealer in
my opinion such a good size and then
take the concealer under the eye I try
not to put too much on my lid so it
doesn't make my eyeshadow crease but
what's left I take over my eyelid
because I have quite dark eyelids
naturally and then buff that all out if
you do get quite dark eyelids or you can
see the veins on your eyelids just take
a bit of concealer or you can use a kind
of skin toned primer like the Urban
Decay primer potion
okay conceal it done I'm now going to
use a little bit of powder just to set
that all in place I don't always use
powder but this conceal is quite creamy
so I like to set it and I'm using this
big brush but I'm desperate to get
another one of the Bobbi Brown sheer
powder brush I use that for blusher but
I want another one to use for powder
because this is a little bit too big it
makes me apply more than I need but I
just kind of tap it onto my chin around
my nose center of my forehead I always
get shiny and then just sweep it over
and under my eyes where there's a lot of
concealer a lot of people do their eyes
next I like to do my face first I'm not
sure why it's just the habit so I'm just
taking might soap &amp;amp; Glory solar powder
which is my favorite bronzer I'm just
gonna use that to bronze and contour I'm
just taking it up into the cheekbones
down to the neck and chin up into the
temples kind of work it into a three
shape so I always think of it like that
and that's kind of a good place to go
for both bronze and contour really you
have to be too neat I'm gonna be doing
green eyes today and when I wear green
on my eyes my face tends to look quite
pale so I do like to bronze up a little
kind of extra when I'm doing green eyes
it's such a good bronzer to use for a
contour as well because it's quite a
cool toned bronzer so it's not too
orange okay I have no idea why I now do
eyebrows and then blush but it's just
the order I like to do things I'm gonna
be using my Anastasia Anastasia you
never know
say that brow ways I'm still loving it
the packaging is terrible I should have
put it in my disappointing
packaging video because the side of the
pencil doesn't wind up properly it keeps
getting stuck it did quite early on when
I bought it it really takes ages to
wind-up and sometimes it's not there at
all which is a little bit annoying but I
can still kind of use it and I do really
like the product so I'm just filling in
the gaps of my eyebrows just a bit at
the front and on the arch as well I find
that filling in the arch makes a little
difference I had the way this dream last
night you have a habit where you have
such a strange dream that the whole day
you don't know whether it's real or not
although this one I was pregnant so it's
definitely not real it was a horrible
dream I was weird after filling in my
brows I like to use a clear brow gel
just to set them all in place a lot of
you probably see me do this a million
times before but I think if you're happy
with products why change them okay now
for blush I'm going to use something new
that I picked up on the weekend from
Kiko I think this is part of their new
collection I think it goes with that
nice bronzer that I've used before maybe
in the last video this is called the
mosaic blush in new Sandro's so it's got
that pretty like mosaic like all
different colors to it and it's a nice
rosy brown but I'm gonna use this
because when I do green eyes I don't
like to put too much color on the cheeks
and this is quite a nice I mean it's not
that light but it's a neutrally brown
color I'm just gonna put use my Bobbi
Brown ashame powder brush just apply
that very lightly to my cheeks I think
that's a very pretty brush okay so let's
go on to eyes I'm gonna be using Mac eye
shadows today I just put together this
little quad because I didn't want to
bring my whole palette down in here is
nylon which is a highlight color patina
which is just the best shade in the
world I've like already hit the bottom
of it
cork and green smoke so I think I'm
going to use all of these maybe not
nylon I'm gonna start with patina when
I'm using a color like green or dark
brown I don't like to take it all the
way into the inside of the eye here I
think it's really heavy it really drags
down the eye just doesn't flatter my eye
shape so I like to use a base color
that's quite neutral and light all over
the lid first especially in the inner
corner I'm gonna use patina it's a
really nice light shimmery
cool tone Brown I'm just gonna apply
that all over the lid I'm not using a
primer because I'm not really going out
anywhere if I really wanted the makeup
to last I'd probably use a primer so can
you see it's just like a cool-toned
pretty Brown I'm gonna apply a little
bit more it's quite sheer and the first
application I like to use fluffy brushes
to apply my product because then you
don't kind of pack on so much it's a
much lighter application and very kind
of flowy and blending and that's kind of
how I like my eyeshadow to be unless I'm
wearing beauty or something that really
needs packing on okay I'm taking another
fluffy brush and this time I'm gonna
take Green Smoke Club is also a favorite
green of mine but it's got very dark
brown undertones so it's a much heavier
evening look where's Green Smoke is a
nice wearable Green's great for the
daytime you'll see it's actually not
that green so if you want to try color
but you're a neutral girl and you're a
bit scared Green Smoke is a really good
one so I'm gonna take a little bit of
that on my brush and then I'm gonna
apply that to the outer and middle part
of the ice and not going right into the
center because that just doesn't flatten
my eye shape so it's got a really nice
bronzy green tone to it I love this
eyeshadow this was the eye shadow look
ash I think it's the whole makeup look
that I wore in the video I did for my
mom and quite a few of you asked for
tutorials so hopefully you'll enjoy this
so you don't need to apply too much you
can always go back and build it up just
think with eyeshadow you need to have
patience and think of it like a little
painting so that's the green done I'm
aware it looks quite messy I haven't
blended up the edges yet because what
I'm gonna do next
take another fluffy brush this is why I
have so many and I'm gonna take the
shade cork which is a matte light brown
it's slightly kind of warm toned which
means it's got kind of orangie tones in
it I really like to have the brown in
the crease makes it a bit more wearable
and I really love cork under the eye so
it kind of joins the whole look together
this fluffy brush from zoeva is the 2 to
8 luxe crease and it's slightly longer
so it's easier to use in the crease to
find the crease of your eye it's just
where your eye socket kind of goes in so
if you put the brush around there and
just press in
lightly you can feel where the creases
and just apply the brown color to the
outside in the crease so it's just like
a transition color do that on both sides
and then I'm going to keep my big Bobby
Brown eyeshadow brush and just blend it
all together I have quite small eyelid
space and big bushy brows so I don't
like it to be too high up towards my
eyebrows I like there to be a bit of
space so I'm just gonna blend that and
clean up a bit
this is the best blending brush ever and
that's the kind of top of the eyelids I
think it looks very pretty and then
gonna take a smaller brush and take that
caulk shade again under the eye I always
like to do this I think it just flatters
my eye shape they look a bit bare
without eyeshadow on no I this zoeva
brush which is the 231 luxe petit crease
is really good for under the eye I think
it's a bit too firm for in the crease
but it's quite nice to blend the crease
out once you've applied the shadow so
I'm taking much under the eye just and
it's a bit too join all together and
then I think I might take a little bit
of nylon actually this is a real kind of
bright highlight shade but I like to
take a little bit on my little finger
and then just dab it in the inner
corners of my eye and it really opens up
and brightens your I haven't done this
in a long time I think it's really
pretty
it's in a very small amount I don't know
if you can see that just in the inner
corner the very light reflective - very
pretty
highlight shade and that's that eye
shadow done I am also going to apply a
bit of eyeliner I don't think you really
need to but I like wearing eyeliner and
I'm going to take a dark brown shade
this is the pixi endless silky eye pen
look how tiny is I've pretty much used
up all of this pencil these are so
creamy and pigmented and smooth and easy
to use this is in the shade I love new
sharp and past the shade I think it's
black cocoa I'm not gonna take this all
the way across the eyes I think it's a
bit too heavy I'm just gonna put a bit
on the outside corner of the eye very
close to the lashes this will just help
thicken the eyelashes a bit I'm putting
it so close to the lashes that it's
almost like I'm actually drawing onto
the lashes so I just put a tiny bit on
the outside I don't know if you can see
the difference but it just kind of lifts
and open my eyes I think especially if
you keep it on the outside corner I'm
just gonna curl my lashes quickly and
then for mascara I'm gonna use the
Rimmel extra
the lash I recently picked this up and I
really like it actually it's quite
similar to the benefit roller lash it
doesn't give me a huge amount of volume
but it gives nice kind of separated
lashes with a lot of length and this
isn't kind of a heavy makeup look I'm
not going out anywhere so natural lashes
are fine with me and yet I think this is
actually quite a good dupe for the
benefit one I'm just gonna apply that to
the lashes it really kind of grips the
lash as well with this little plastic
brush I don't think it's waterproof so
if you need waterproof this probably
isn't for you they might do a waterproof
version though it's gonna stroke it
through the lashes from the roots to the
tip oh no I hate when that happens
oh no all right so carry on with the
mascara I think the best way to avoid
that is to take off the mascara on the
tip of the brush but that was just
completely my fault okay eyes are done
nice and green and smoky and I'm just
gonna finish with a lipstick I am
obsessed with the new Chanel lipstick
this is Adrienne which is my favorite
shade it's a really wearable nude before
these came out I was thinking I am on
the hunt for the best nude I had no idea
that I would find it in a Chanel
lipstick but this is just the perfect
nude I've been wearing it like every day
this month I'm pretty obsessed with it I
will show you they're very moisturizing
my lips are really dry at the moment I
don't know why but I've been having to
go to bed so much lip balm on but these
are really moisturizing and easy to wear
it's very similar to my lip color
slightly lighter really nice glossy just
smooths everything out they're so
comfortable to wear even the brighter
shades but this shade is literally been
living in my handbag because it goes
with everything and I think with a green
eye look especially it's nice to wear a
nude I think if you were to wear a
bright lip it'd be a bit too much so
that's the finished look I hope you guys
enjoyed seeing like a green smokey eye I
did ask on Twitter whether you wanted to
see this look or a bluey purpley
eyeliner look and it was very much split
down the middle but I think a few more
people wanted green smokey so maybe next
month I will do a look with this amazing
blue Kiko eyeliner I have become
obsessed with I did a tweet showing a
photo of me wearing on the weekend it's
just like a blue eyeliner under the eye
so let me know if you'd be interested in
seeing that look maybe next month and
let me know what you think of this as
well thank you so much for watching this
video
and don't forget to subscribe and leave
me a comment I'll see you guys in my
next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
