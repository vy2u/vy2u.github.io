monthly makeup routine if you've been
watching my everyday may love then
you're going to know this makeup look
very well because I genuinely have been
wearing it all month which is the whole
point of these videos to show you my
current makeup routine the lip combo
especially it's something I've
completely fallen in love with you guys
saw in the vlogs that I was on the hunt
for Mac lip liner in saw for so long I
finally found it
I coincidentally picked up at MAC
lipstick in May at the same time not
realizing they're kind of meant to go
together and at the same color and the
combination is amazing it's long lasting
it's beautiful I have been loving it's
kind of the only lip look I've been
wearing when I've been going out a month
so I thought I'd show you guys the
current routine some products you have
seen many times before and some on you
it's a very easy look though so
hopefully you'll appreciate that you
won't think is boring but I'm going to
get started and the first thing I'm
going to do is use a hydrating mist I've
been really enjoying using a mist
whether it's the urban decay setting
spray or like chanel serum or whatever
kind of hydrating products I have near
me I do my skincare routine in the
morning and then just before I do my
makeup I like to add a boost of
hydration I just got this which is the
Clinique Moisture Surge face spray it
says thirsty skin relief I haven't tried
this yet but it sounds like it's right
on my street she's going to quickly
actually click on my hair okay so I'm
just gonna do a few spritzes of this and
a little tip actually which I learnt you
have a different makeup artist when I
saw her doing it if you start spraying
away from your face it isn't quite so
much of a shock when you start spraying
onto your face so if I start spraying
there that's really nice actually it's
quite a wet one it's really nice though
I just feel like it gets my skin ready
for makeup okay I'm going to use my
Burberry foundation I was going to use
something else just to kind of mix it up
but I want to stay very honest in these
videos and this is the foundation I've
been using all month I haven't found a
need to use anything else
somedays I've been using a CC cream from
what something a bit lighter but when
I'm going out I use this because it's
just the best foundation and spread it
out with my fingers first and then you
know the drill using my Bobbi Brown full
coverage face brush just going to blend
that in this foundation somehow gives
you like a really good smooth coverage
but it's actually not that full coverage
I'd say it's like to medium actually so
it's very quick to blend in it's by no
means perfect skin that's not really
what I'm aiming for
a bit of kind of just even out skin tone
a little bit I don't like to go out the
day line for looking wearing loads of
makeup okay now what I'm going to do
before I do my under-eye concealer so
I'm going to use a little bit of the
Bobbi Brown hydrating eye cream I know
some of you are going to say it's really
weird to put that on top of my
foundation but I didn't put much
foundation under my eyes anyway and I
haven't found that it disrupts the
foundation at all just taking a really
small amount and I'm just going to Pat
it under the eye and if you do have dry
skin like me this is really nice to do
before your concealer and it stops it
from drying and caking under your eyes
hope the light is not too dark by the
way I just thought it's better like this
then kind of overexposed
then you won't be able to see what I'm
doing so hydrating and nice a really
light as eye cream okay now I'm going to
take the Bobbi Brown corrector I used to
use this all the time
I didn't use it for years I've kind of
fallen back in love with it I got the
shade light peach I used to wear light
bisque but I got color matched at the
counter Liberty she matched me to this
the idea of the Bobbi Brown corrector is
it's like an orange e salmony color that
cancels out the dark bluey purpley turns
on your eye there's all these different
shades depending on the sort of dark
circles you get this peachy tones good
for me so I just take a little bit my
finger it's so creamy you can press it
on with your finger like that I'm just
doing it right in the inner corners
where I get really dark circles and then
using my Laura Mercier
I think it's an eyeshadow brush but I
use it for concealer I'm just blending
out the edges
I wouldn't recommend this product if you
get oily because it's very creamy and it
will crease but I like to use it just
underneath my regular concealer just to
help with those dark circles from or
this late night editing good for your
lids too if you have visible veins like
I do you can take a bit onto the lid so
very small amount product there and then
I'm going to take it but it concealers
upon top I've been really enjoying the
Clarins instant concealer at the moment
this is really nice for days where
you're wearing a tinted moisturizer or a
CC cream because you can kind of use it
like a foundation I like to apply it
with my finger very very like
moisturizing I'm going to put a little
bit under my eyes actually nice under
the eye because it's quite brightening
it's nice so just like press it into the
skin I know at least I can put in quite
a lot on it is quite a liquidy little
bit on the chin and
the nose and then taking the laura
mercier brush you're just going to blend
out the edges so that move it around too
much and then I feel like if you leave
the under eyes at last the product sets
a little bit so it's not quite as
liquidy and then there's actually not
that much to blend because you've kind
of done it all with your finger I still
love the Urban Decay Naked concealer I'm
in between shades at the moment I've got
light neutral and light warm and look
how different they are pop it makes my
skin this one's too dark in this one's
far too light and so I do mix them
sometimes but I find that quite annoying
that there isn't a perfect shade for me
at the moment okay so now I'm going to
do a bit of bronzing by the way look how
cute this is this is I'm keeping my
brushes in a little marble pot from H&amp;amp;M
home love that okay I'm going to be
using this from Too Faced which is their
milk chocolate bronzer I have been
obsessed with this this month I don't I
won't talk about too much because it
would definitely be my monthly
favourites but it's the perfect light
bronzy color I'm just gonna take that on
my Hakuhodo brush and just take up I
like the outer part of my face I'm kind
of going to use it all over like a
traditional bronzer I haven't really
been contouring much this month haven't
been bothered for it this is such a good
bronzer if you have pale skin because if
you have my color skin you can build up
enough that it's visible but still
natural but if you just take a small
amount on the brush it's really good for
pale skin to face have loads of
different bronzers I've done a blog post
on it so I will link that down below
okay I just made it a little bit bright
exciting kit was getting a bit dark so
hopefully it's better for you guys now
I'm going to do my brows really boring
Anastasia brow for always I just use
this same thing all the time just going
to fill in the front part and the arches
I recently had my brows threaded at a
blink brow bar so don't need to do much
really just going to leave them like
that and put on a bit of clear brow gel
so everything stays in place okay for
blusher I'm going to use this one from
Tarte I haven't used the Tarte Amazonian
clay blushes for quite a while but this
month I have been enjoying them this
shade is a shot I didn't have that if
that's how it's pronounced it's like a
peachy pink color it's very pretty so
I'm just going to take a very small
amount because the eyes and lips are
quite intense so just a little bit to
add a bit of color it's a very pretty
natural color actually
like that and I'm going to take a bit of
highlights because I've been loving like
that golden e highlight II look at the
moment this highlighter is insane it's
from Laura Mercier I hate the packaging
because it's so bulky but the product
inside is ridiculous look at that it's
like liquid melted gold with kind of
pinky tones in it as well it's so so
beautiful I'm going to take my Charlotte
Tilbury brush and just put up a bit of
that just right on the tops of my
cheekbones oh it catches the light so
nicely I've seen loads of you guys
comment as well as saying you've got
this and love it
it's a beautiful highlighter okay so
let's go on to eyes today I'm going to
be using the by terry ombre black star
in bronze moon it's a very easy look but
there are so many different shadow
sticks you can use Lancome have one Kiko
have one Chanel have one Bobbi Brown
have one these kind of wind up cream eye
shadow sticks are all the rage and a
good reason they're so easy to use all
I'm going to use pop a bit of eyeliner
is this one shadow stick so stead of
using like three different eye shadows
it's just this so easy to use and I've
just been going straight for this every
time I've been going out so sorry if
you've seen this before but it's so good
how to use it again so I'm just winding
up a little bit and I'm going to just
you see how the concealer always creases
on my lid but once I rub it in like that
it's always fine this doesn't crease at
all of me as eye shadow so I'm just
going to rub it quite close to the lash
line and then take up like almost all
over the lid but not quite because I
always feel like once you start blending
it goes kind of higher up anyway so you
don't want to start too high so I put it
on the eye like that and then taking a
fluffy brush preferably a clean one
haven't had time to clean my brushes
before this video I'm just going to
blend the edges I'm not really touching
that the lid with a shadow is just the
edge oh how nice is that it's such a
beautiful golden e bronze and I just
think that alone on the lid is so nice I
never need to do anything else sometimes
I'll take another brush just make sure
the edges are all blended out I'm going
to take it again on the other eye and
then
are the edges just kind of used
back-and-forth motion you can feel the
crease in your eye where it kind of dips
in and that's where you want to blend so
pretty I'm also going to take under the
eye and this is where I really feel like
it brings the whole look together it's
the perfect shape for under the eyes or
don't be afraid to do it too thick I
think it looks really cool especially we
don't like to wear black eyeliner in the
waterline I feel like this is an easier
way of doing like a smoky look but then
make sure you blend it out but I can't
do this without opening my mouth just
impossible so that's the eye shadow done
and you can leave it there or you can
add a bit Brown eyeliner you don't leave
it there actually I was gonna use Mac
Teddy which I really like but I actually
think it can be left there I'm just
gonna blend it a bit more yeah I'm going
to leave actually with no eyeliner and
I'm just going to use mascara three
mascaras I've been loving this month
which are all quite different too faced
better than sex mascara ridiculous name
benefit roller lash mascara and the
scandal queen fairy drops mascara fairy
drops one is very natural on me it's
more of a daytime doesn't do that much
to my lashes but it's kind of a little
bit something in it's nice the benefit
roller lash one is very like long
individual lashes really pretty for the
daytime if I want like quite impressive
lashes but nothing too heavy and the Too
Faced one is like serious big lashes so
I'm going to use this one today because
I would probably do this look for a
night out this is what I wore to my
friend's engagement party so I'm going
to do some big lashes it's a big fat
brush it's quite a wet mascara you
hardly have to use any and it really
coats the lashes I should probably have
used the eyelash curler but I don't have
one down here with me alright look at
that look at the difference huge big
like sixties lashes amazing I actually
have to stop with this because if I put
too much on it looks ridiculous but just
to kind of balance it out of it I'm
going to take a little bit of the
Clinique bottom lash mascara and just
run it over the lashes just a little bit
okay so onto the final part of this
makeup look and that's the lips which is
my favorite part
Mac saw lip liner which is always out of
stock because kylie jenner said that
uses it and that's how she gets her big
lips which is alive because it's all
surgery but whatever it's still really
nice lip liner and Mac mare which is a
matte shade in a very similar color
pretty much the same color sauce they're
both kind of a pinky neutrally brownie I
don't really know very different what i
usually wear but i love the finished
look it's a bit kind of i'm trying to be
a supermodel
esque but it does give you big like
amazing lips even if you just line your
natural lips so I'm gonna take the liner
first I'm going to line the entire lips
not just the outside and the reason for
that is because if the lipstick fades
you don't wanna be left with just a line
so it's better to do the whole lips I
have moisturize my lips first cuz
they're a bit dry it's actually quite
pink it's quite dark pink actually not
great idea to do this when your lips are
dry if you have thin lips you can over
draw them a little bit but I wouldn't
recommend doing it too much because
it'll be a bit 90s I like to rest my
little finger on my chin to do the top
lip and I draw in a bit of a Cupid's bow
because thanks to my dad I haven't
really got one oh my going to find it
tickles so much does anyone else find
that okay so that is the lip liner and
then the lipstick I'm just going to
apply that on top
isn't that so nice so it's quite once
you put on it's quite a dark pink but I
think it's really pretty I think it goes
really nicely brown eyeshadow and and I
think that's the finished look that's
it's gonna take down my hair so let me
know what you think of this look I hope
it's quite easy I know it feels like it
takes a long time because I'm chatting
throughout but it's just one eyeshadow
fit bronzer blusher it's the lips that
kind of make the look and I can't stop
wearing this lip combo so let me know if
you find it if you can get your hands on
Max or whether it's still sold out

weeks but I'm really glad I found it if
