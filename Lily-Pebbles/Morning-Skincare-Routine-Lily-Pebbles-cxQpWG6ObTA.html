three-part skincare series and this is
going to be my morning skincare routine
I really hope you enjoy watching it the
first thing I do when I wake up is go
into my bathroom and before I start my
skincare routine I always make sure to
wash my hands at the moment I've been
using the e soap resurrection hand wash
it smells really good and obviously
looks really nice in your bathroom I
then take one of my large pots and wall
pads I like to use the large ones just
because it saves time they're much
quicker I take a couple of pumps of
Bioderma and sweep this over my eyes and
face I then take my radical hydrating
cleanser and I like to use this one in
the morning because it's a bit lighter
in consistency I don't feel like I need
to use a thick balm cleanser in the
morning so this one's just really
refreshing and light
I then take a damp muslin cloth and wipe
it all off
this one's an Emma Hardy cloth I also
like to use the flannels from Primark I
then take my Hydra neuron and use this
for my morning serum I take a small
amount and just put it all over my face
and it works really well as a base
before your moisturizer it doesn't leave
your skin feeling amazing it's a little
bit tacky but it works really well for
my eye cream I like to use the elf H
absolute eye complex in the morning
because there's a sort of gelled
consistency and you can take it right up
to the eye so it's really good if you
get dryness under your eye and it works
really well as a base under concealer I
use my ring finger as it's the lightest
and take it all the way above the eye
and under an alternative to this would
be the origins no puffery and I use this
when I've had a bad night with hayfever
if my eyes are looking a little bit
puffy I then take my daily moisturizer
at the moment I'm using the origins
ginseng as my morning moisturizer this
smells like oranges it's really
refreshing and because of the gel
consistency it's very fresh and light on
the skin
for the final step for my morning
routine I like to put on an SPF so at
the moment I'm using the Estee Lauder
day wear SPF 50 I like this one it's
slightly green tinted so it's good for
redness and it smells of cucumbers which
i think is really nice and refreshing
and I like to use a high SPF every day
to protect my skin so thanks so much for
watching I really hope you enjoyed it
don't forget to come back on Thursday to
see my evening skin care routine and
I'll see you then bye hi today I'm going
to be filming my July favorites which is
my favorite time of the month I love
talking through my favorite product</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
