my most worn summer thing so I thought
that now it's September summers kind of
finished coming to an end I thought I'd
kind of look back and talk about the
things that I've been wearing and using
most throughout the summer I actually
did this tag last year when I was just
starting YouTube videos and I really
enjoyed it so I thought I'd do it again
and I kind of like the questions it's a
nice little sum up of the summer first
one its most worn nail polish and that
was without a doubt this bourgeois one
second gel nail polish in turquoise
block I love this whenever I don't know
what to put my nails I seem to always go
back to this one it's just a really nice
bright turquoise color it's not too blue
it's not too green I think I've spoken
about this loads before I love it which
is really wide and makes application
really easy and they last really well on
the nails so this has definitely been my
most one then most used hair products
and that has been my bumble and bumble
straight shampoo and conditioner I have
really been enjoying using these i have
been using other products kind of here
in there but i keep going back to these
ones they've got some kind of straight
technology and then that makes your hair
straighter for longer when you
straighten it em but there's no sulfates
or anything in them and I think they're
really nice I love bumble and bumble for
us and I definitely repurchase these
when I run out although they seem to be
lasting for ages my most worn bag has
been my whistles clutch bag or I think
it's actually a makeup bag I got the one
that's black on one side and mint on the
other I actually found this in the sale
I looked everywhere I think that was
like one left in London but I really
like this because you can kind of use it
as a makeup bag or little beauty bag to
put your handbag but I also use it as a
clutch bag and I've been wearing a lot
in summer evenings if I'm wearing a
dress I wore it to a wedding it's just
really useful and goes with everything
and it's leather so it will last a long
time it's got a nice kind of gold as it
and I love this my most worn shoes have
been my steve madden sandals i mentioned
in my August favorites video I love
these they go with everything they're
really comfortable and you would have
seen them already if you watch my August
favorites if you didn't I'll link it
below my most worn item of clothing
that's quite hard one because I don't
really know what it is it's probably
like a boring t-shirt but I have been
wearing this dress a lot and it's from
Topshop you've probably seen on my
Instagram if you follow me on there
don't it's at lady pebbles and I've
bought it so I like to wear it with kind
of black grungy boots to toughen up a
bit it's a red dress it's got a nice low
V and it's just really flattering it
goes in at the waist and then kind of
hangs nicely I really like how it fits
it's got a zip down the back and yes
it's really easy to put on you just need
to put on the dress and you look like
you've made an effort psyche whole
outfit done I love clothes like that so
I've been wearing this a lot this summer
my most worn accessory is probably my
michael kors watch I'll take it off I've
had this rages now maybe about a year
but I never take off I love it I get a
lot of questions actually asking which
one it is and I got it from Asus and
it's called the boyfriend watch it's
kind of like the rose gold one everyone
has but it's a lot thinner and lighter
its got like a really flat round face
which I really like it's not as kind of
chunky as the other one which just
didn't really suit me I try it on in
store so I really like this one and I
always wear it so that's probably my
most worn accessory for most worn
foundation it's the laura mercier oil
free tinted moisturizer in nude I also
mentioned this in my August favorites so
you've probably heard about it already
but I really like this it's slightly
more coverage than the original tinted
moisturizer and just applies really
nicely with a buffing brush I'm wearing
it now I've been wearing it pretty much
all summer and i really like it most
worn bronzer and blush sure well that's
not hard it's of course my NARS Laguna
bronzer i love this i will always
repurchase it and always go back to it's
my favorite bronzer it's pretty much
Matt but with a tiny bit of shimmer in
it so it's not too kind of harsh and
nothing glittery at all just you can
contour with it you can use it all over
it's just the best runs out without a
doubt ever and for blusher I've been
wearing this estee lauder gel blush it
in hot fuse I think I've mentioned this
in a video it's really weird comes in
like a pump and it's a gel but I've been
wearing this a lot because it's really
long lasting so if it's like a hot
summer's day I literally apply a tiny
amount on my cheek off it in and it will
not move all day because the first thing
to disappear on me it's always my
blushes so I've really been enjoying
wearing this is summer and it means that
by the end of the day I still have like
a nice flush to my cheeks and it's an
amazing product i love this most one
lipstick is quite hard because they do
tend to keep loads of lip products
my handbag I'm just kind of reached for
whatever i'm in the mood for but why not
be wearing a lot this summer is my
Revlon lip butter in cherry tart I often
kind of do really neutral makeup not
much of my eyes and then I want red lip
but one that's easier to wear in the
summer that's not too kind of red lip
Hollywood is this one because it's quite
shame it's bit like a tinted lip balm so
I always keep this in my handbag and if
I end up going out in the evening and I
just grabbed us at my bag put a bit on
it's like a sheer juicy red and it's
lovely I have gone through one of these
already i think i have quite a few and i
really like them my most warmest car has
probably been maybelline the rocket I go
through my scars quite quickly and
towards the end of the summer I was
loving YSL baby doll which is what i'm
using now but for most of the summer I
was using this and I really like it I've
heard a lot of people don't like this I
think I have quite easy lashes that
quite curly and long so um I often kind
of like a lot of mascaras as long as
they do a good job and I do really like
this one it's got quite a big plastic
wand and it gives good length and volume
and I definitely going to finish it and
I have been enjoying it this summer my
most worn I shadow has probably been
from my mac palette and I think it was
all that glitters which is this one here
and it's kind of a it's a fresh shimmery
eyeshadow but it's quite pinky champagne
it's one that's easy to put all over the
lid and it gives a really nice shimmer
and I like in the summer where I really
liked colors on my eye because it kind
of brightens up your whole makeup look
and all that glitters is a really nice
one is one of the most recent ones i've
got i didn't get it for ages because i
thought it would be too pink for me but
when i tried on it's actually got a
little bit of golden in it and its
really nice nice for brown eyes brown
hair so if you haven't tried it
definitely recommend watching that when
you're near a mac store and finally most
worn perfume now this one was hard to
think about because i think i've been a
little bit kind of fickle with perfumes
recently and i often forget to wear one
it's just how the last thing I do before
I leave and I keep forgetting to put one
on so I just have one line around my
handbag and I'll use whatever's there
but what I do always like to use in the
summer is the stellar summer perfume I
like the original stellar but it's quite
heavy and it's more like an evening
fragrance so this is her summer version
and it's just a bit lighter and
summary and fresh it's really nice I
feel like it's a really mature perfume
but i really like it an obviously the
bottle is so pretty so I've been
reaching for this one when I have been
wearing perfume so those are all my most
worn things from the summer I hope you
enjoyed seeing them I'm kind of excited
for autumn/winter I obviously don't like
the cold weather but I love the whole
like makeup look and hats and scarves
and obviously it's my birthday in
December so that's really excited if you
want to do this tag please do i would
type my YouTube friends but I always
feel like it's a bit pressure to like do
this tag you don't have to do it i might
link some people below that i would like
to see do this tag it's September's it's
a nice time to kind of round up the
summer and I hope you enjoyed this video
I'll see you soon bye bye Cameron films
and ages my past few videos won't feed
film that's scheduled to go up so
there's a little bit weird right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
