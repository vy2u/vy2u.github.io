the most worn summer items and I was
tagged by Anna from Viviana does makeup
so I'll link her channel below she's
lovely and quickly sorry about the
backgrounds different that window over
there is it's just so sunny today that
is shining the Sun on me and I couldn't
get it right so I've had to sit here
apologies if it's a bit dark because the
lights behind me also sorry for
background noise all the windows are
open
anyway that's over now I'm gonna start
they're sort of a list of twelve
products and then you just say which one
was your most worn in summer so the
first thing is nail polish and this
one's pretty easy I'm sure you all know
it's an Essie mint candy apple oh I do
change my nail polish color quite a lot
but I always seem to go back to this one
especially in the summer it's just so
easy
it always looks nice and kind of goes
with everything it's just a really nice
mint blue green and this isn't it with
the new brush from super dragon boots so
that's probably my most worn this summer
the next category is most worn hair
product and in the summer I tend to wear
my hair curly more you know it's
straight now but it's just easier when
it's curly because too hot or straighten
it after the shower and the products
I've been using at the moment this one's
a new one actually for me and it's Toni
&amp;amp; Guy prep color defining oil and this
is really nice it kind of comes out as
like a clear jelly texture and it's
really easy to just put through all my
hair and it's all just moisturiser set
and then I use the Regis curl lock curl
cream to just define the curls more and
keep them like in their place so these
two together have been working really
well and I think it's this one yeah they
both smell really nice actually and my
mom always says why your hair smells
amazing so yeah I've been really liking
these this summer the next is most one
bag and mine's not very summery actually
it's actually quite wintery bag but it's
this bag from a wrong way which is
online-shop I'll link it below and it
looks like this it's a big black bag and
it's got two zips there and there and
then the same on the other side as well
and then it's got this sort of orange
inside with buttons here it's also got a
really nice long strap so you can wear
it on your shoulder which I really like
so I don't like holding bags on my arm
so yeah I've just been using this every
day it's really big and fits everything
I need in it and yeah I've been loving
that it's also quite soft as well it's
not too hard so it's comfortable to wear
the next is most worn shoes and that's
definitely these sorry they're really
dirty it's actually quite gross to show
these but that's because they're so worn
these Topshop pumps so they're they're
kind of like brokes I think I don't
really know they're like pale pink nude
pink
I'd say paintin and they've got this
nice detailing here at the front there's
really really comfy because I'm in half
a size I'm a six and a half I find it
really hard to find comfortable shoes
because six isn't normally too small and
the sevens a normal too big I also have
these really weird toes that are like
flick up and I always get holes in my
shoes and I just got holding these
yesterday I'm so upset
but yeah but these are really
comfortable and I don't know if they
still do them if they do I'm definitely
gonna go get another pair because I've
just worn them like every day they go
like when it's a really hot day they go
anywhere with shorts and dresses but
when it's not that hot they actually
don't really nice of jeans as well so
I'm really glad I caught those the next
thing is clothing item this is quite
hard because I haven't really been
wearing like one piece of clothing more
than anything else I don't think but I
chose this one because I have been
wearing quite a lot just because it's
really easy and it says t-shirt from
Topshop and it's really plain it's just
like this sort of gray colour with like
speckles on it and it's short sleeved
and it's like rolled up and then on the
back there's a zip
and everywhere in squalor
Kentuckians dresses you can wear its
shorts or jeans and it's quite thin as
well as it's good when it's hot and if
it's not hot you can wear a cardigan
because the weather here is it's not
like the normal summer in the UK we
don't actually get Sun the whole time
it's really sunny now but like yesterday
it was raining so yeah this has been
really good it's got a nice pocket there
as well so I've worn that quite a lot
most worn accessories are definitely
these bracelets um I really like wear
and then they just give a nice bit of
color to any outfit and I'd literally
wear them every day they're so easy this
one is from a market in Israel this one
is a Michael Kors bracelet that rich got
me as a present and this one is a Donna
levy
friendship bracelets which I really like
so um yeah those my most want
accessories and I really like them
actually most on foundation is quite a
new one for me but I've been wearing it
over the last sort of a month and really
loved it and it's the origins plant
scription SPF 15 and this is a new
foundation I'm not sure if it's out yet
it might be out in September or in
August I'll put the information below it
was really nice especially for the
summer because it's really moisturizing
it kind of looks like a tinted
moisturizer but gives really good
coverage as well and I wear a shave
color at zero to light neutral and I
just really like this and it's got SPF
15 which is obviously good for when it's
sunny I use a brush to apply this but
you can also use your hands if you want
sort of a lighter coverage and yeah I've
really really been loving this all
summer so I'm happy with this most one
bronzer and blusher I'm going to quite
boring here because I always use the
same ones like I have so I have quite a
few bronzers and I have loads of blushes
and I do change up but the ones I use
the most definitely the NARS Laguna I'm
sure you've heard of a million times but
it's just so easy to use I've used up
quite a bit of this one and yeah I just
use it every day with a real techniques
brush and i love it it's not too dark
it's not glittery for when it's sunny I
don't like glittery bronzers
it's just perfect Runza and the blush
that i've used the most is benefit
coralista just because it's like the
perfect coral blush it doesn't give up
too much color because I don't want to
look too powdery within the summer but
it's just a really nice flush of color
and I absolutely love this and it's
definitely worth the price tag I know a
lot of people comment on how expensive
benefit blushes are but it's definitely
worth it this one my most worn lip
product a probably combination of these
two this is the fresh sugar lip polish
which is like a sugar scrub for your
lips and this is amazing because I often
have get quite dry lips so wearing
anything light lipstick or lip gloss it
just starts flaking and looks awful so I
use this in the evenings and it's so
nice it tastes nice and it really does a
good job exfoliating your lips and then
I've also been wearing quite a lot of
this deal lipstick and this is in number
three five three blush I've spoken about
this before it's just a really nice nude
pink and really easy for a day and night
and I absolutely love the formula of
these really really creamy and feels
really nice on the lips my mouth war
mascara has been the wire sell shocky
mascara because I sorts have been trying
this out again I used the last year but
I sort of go into it again now and I
really like it gives loads of volume and
yeah I don't know I don't have much to
say about this it's not like my favorite
mascara it's got really funny scent to
it as well I don't know if anyone else
has noticed that but it's not my
favorite mascara but I do really like it
and it's definitely been my most warm
mascara this summer my most worn I
shadow I think it's from this Inglot
palette I don't really wear loads of
eyeshadow when it's really sunny because
again I just don't want to look too
powdery so I sort of just been going for
this Inglot color which is the number
four to two and it's just sort of a
man's light brown color and I've just
been using this just in the crease just
for a little bit of definition and then
I use like an eyeliner or something a
nice brown eyeliner I've been using
recently um but yeah I don't but shadow
all over the lid I just use a little bit
in the crease and that sort of does the
job really and I really like that look
so that's what I've been sort of doing
all summer the final category is most
one fragrance and this is easy
it's my gem Malone wild Blue Bell
cologne which I really really love I
have the small version so I keep it in
my handbag and spritz on all the time
and I love it so summery but really
growing up as well and just lovely
really like this I recommend you go and
try this out in the shop um because it's
lovely
so those are my most worn items from the
summer I'm going to try and find some of
the people that I watch on YouTube
