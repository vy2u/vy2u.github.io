whole busy day plan but it's snowing so
much more I live that there's no way my
car's going to make it out of the road
so instead I thought I'd film so
apologies for the kind of up greasy hair
they look like I have a bit of a pea
head and so today I'm going to show you
my kind of top 10 beauty tools they're
not the top 10 beauty tools they're just
the top 10 from what I have because I
don't use kind of hair tones and a lot
of things which would obviously be in a
video like this so they're just kind of
my top 10 and so yeah I thought I'd just
show you my favorites so the first one
is this brush and it's from michael
mercier I think that's how you say it
all Michelle I think it's mikkel I don't
know something like that and and these
brushes come there's three there's one
for kind of thick afro hair which is
this one and there's a medium one and
there's one fourth in here and I really
like this I didn't get on a tool with
the tangle teezer I found it really hard
to hold because there wasn't a handle
and I actually found it harder than like
a normal brush so I don't really know
how it's kind of a tangle teezer but a
lot of people love it anyway I really
like this one it's got handles it's much
easier to hold and especially in like
the shower and it's got lots of
different kind of Bristol's they're all
different lengths and I just find it
really easy when i use i could detangle
it's really easy to brush through my
hair using this and i'm really happy
with it the next tool are my ghd's me
just unwind of them I've always used
ghds I used to use the big ones for kind
of afro hair and I really like those and
it kind of made the whole process a lot
quicker because they're much bigger kind
of plates but I found it really hard to
get right to the roots and do the
underneath bit of my hair and it
couldn't get kind of precise with it so
I never got these and I actually love
these these are kind of normal size they
do tiny ones for like men's hair as well
and big ones but these are the kind of
medium sized and they're black I think
they might be like a limited edition but
I love ghd's I won't I know when I first
started straightening my hair
straighteners were all for most of the
really really awful and then ghds came
out and they were so much better so I've
never really tried anything since I'm
sure there are other ones that just as
good by now but I've never felt the need
to try any others because I've always
got on really well ghd's they make my
hair really silky smooth and they make
straightening really easy and quick so I
love those the next thing is sort of
makeup storage and the first one is from
Muji and it's this kind of perspex
holder I think it's meant to be for your
desk for stationary but I use it for
brushes and it basically has four
compartments take out one of these you
can kind of see that's like one
rectangle compartment and these for my
brushes so these guys live on my beauty
desk or whatever it is and I think it's
really good as perfect is exactly what i
was looking for i got it by a year ago I
think and I really love it you can put
stones at the bottom so that the brush
is stand up better but I don't really
mind just kind of having it in there so
that first of I can't member how much it
was I should I find the link and put it
below I love that for brushes though and
i also have a couple of empty candles i
keep kind of my face brushes all-in-one
and I try and group them the next thing
is this lipstick holder and looks like
this it basically has like a little
slant here so that you can always be
dusty so you can leave it kind of leans
towards you like that on your table and
then it has 12 slots and I keep my 12
kind of favor of the moment lipsticks
and keeps on my guess because I have a
whole drawer look for us and I can't go
into the drawer like every time so I
just have my favorite kind of 12
lipsticks here and it's really good just
has little compartments and they slot in
perfectly and I got this from the
holding company there's one in London
and there's a website you can order
online i'll leave the link that's below
it's perfect exactly i was looking for
you can search for hours on ebay for
things like this but i just thought i
don't really like find something ebay so
i'm happy that i found this kind of in a
store and and there's so much amazing
storage stuff and the holding company I
me like this I just have kind of Revlon
lip butter in a mask elliptical eyes are
glossy stain a fresh sugar lip balm to
do lipsticks and then six mac lipsticks
and there's a kind of
favorites at the moment so I love this
in this kind so it's just in front of my
brushes then let's think our muslin
cloth and I couldn't live without them I
use them every kind of morning and
evening when I wash my face I use a
mixture of Liz l muslin cloth I have
when I bought the cleanse &amp;amp; polish it
came with a couple but spoon as if I
needed to buy more kind of cloths like
this I just go to the baby department in
like John Lewis or Phoenix they sell my
muslin cloth obviously people use them
for babies and some of them are really
baby you just cut them up I think it's
much cheaper way than buying kind of
result ones i also have sarah chapman
kind of flannelly type things so these
kind of go on your hand like this and
one side smooth on one sides more
exfoliating and there's quite a nice to
use with the cleanser as well and they
do kind of slip off your hand so I tend
to just kind of hold them like that but
I really like they became a pack of five
I think and I've washed these loads and
they're still going so these are quite a
good little investment I think then
something for nails you know i love my
nail dotting tools I've spoken about
this before I got them from amazon for
like two pounds it's like the cheapest
thing I've ever bought that I used so
much and you just get five nails on
CTools with different sized dots on both
sides and I use this all the time even
if i'm just doing dots you know not that
good at nails but it's quite fun to play
around with them and i'm really happy i
bought these i use them a lot so the
next one is a really weird one but it is
very important to me and it's this
little plastic e spoon thing and if this
came with kind of a travel set or you
get the little travelpod this came with
it and i use this every morning and
every evening because i hate products
that come in pots and so if I favorite
products do like my origins moisturizer
that I use in the morning and evening
and I hate sticking my finger in it and
it all gets in your nail and it's so
messy so I just use this to scoop a
little bit of the moisturizer out put it
on the back of my hand and then
use it from there and I use this all the
time even though it's really crappy
cheap piece of nothing it's very
important to me obviously you can kind
of use anything I just happen to have
this around but it's nice to have a
little scooper because i hate sticking
my finger in the pot so that's one of my
most used beauty tools the next eyelash
curlers and although i don't use these
very often i have quite curly lashes
anyway if I've got a night out or a
special occasion than I do because it
does make a big difference and these are
the shimmer eyelash curlers these are
think some of the best arounds I know
the Chanel ones meant to be quite good
as well but I'm pretty sure everyone
lovely loves these and i got these
absolutely years ago my friend used to
work at shirt mirror and she gave them
to me and years and years ago and they
still lost you have to change the
robbery a bit every now and again but
they're really really good curling my
eyelashes does freak me out a bit so I
didn't do it often but I'm very
impressed when I do use these and then
obviously makeup brushes and really
important beauty tools for me I'm not
going to go through my whole collection
but i'm showing my top 5 which i'm sure
you all know by now anyway Real
Techniques stippling brush I use a
foundation will Techniques blush brush
as for bronzer japonesque 324 I use for
blusher a mac 217 I used for eyeshadow a
lot and the Mac 224 I used for concealer
and those are my most used brushes that
I absolutely love the final thing is a
latent any crystal nail file comes as a
nice little cakes and it basically looks
like that and it's kind of a tease made
out of glass basically I hate filing
nails and my older sister has a massive
photo of it i'm not that bad but i've
always hated filing nails what makes me
cringe and i'm a nail biter so I always
kind of avoided it just bit my nails
instead which is gross I know but this
code change our mind is so much nicer to
use a crystal nail file if you don't
like filing your nails you should try
this and I think if you really really
don't like it then it's not
get any better because it's still a
little bit kind of cringy but it's much
smoother and softer and less harsh and I
just hate nail files so I really really
like this crystal nail file and I think
it's nice little investment as well and
it comes in a case so you can keep it
all nice and yeah it's just made my
nails feel in much better condition so I
really like that and that's my top 10
beauty tools so i hope you liked seeing

think it's down there just under my name

my name i'm not really sure somewhere
