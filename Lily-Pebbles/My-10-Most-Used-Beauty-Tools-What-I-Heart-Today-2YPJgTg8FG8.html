whole busy day planned
but it's snowing so much where I live
that there's no way my car's gonna make
it out of the road so instead I thought
I'd film so apologies for the kind of up
greasy hair
they look like I have a bit of a pea
head so today I'm going to show you my
kind of top 10 beauty tools they're not
the top ten beauty tools they're just
the top ten from what I have because I
don't use kind of hair tongs and a lot
of things which would obviously be in a
video like this so they're just kind of
my top 10 and so yeah I thought I'd just
show you my favorites so the first one
is this brush and it's from Michael
Mercier I think that's how you say it or
Michelle I think it's Mikkel I don't
know something like that
and these brushes come there's three
there's one for kind of thick afro hair
which is this one and as a medium one
and as one forth in here and I really
like this I didn't get on a tool with
the tangle teezer I found it really hard
to hold because there wasn't a handle
and I actually found it harder than like
a normal brush so I don't really know
how it's kind of a tangle teezer but a
lot of people love it anyway I really
like this one it's got handles it's much
easier to hold and especially in like
the shower and it's got lots of
different kind of bristles there are all
different lengths and I just find it
really easy when I use like a detangle
it's really easy to brush through my
hair using this and I'm really happy
with it the next tool are my ghd's let
me just unwind of them and I've always
used ghd's I used to use the big ones
for kind of afro hair and I really liked
those and it kind of made the whole
process a lot quicker because they're
much bigger kind of place but I found it
really hard to get right to the roots
and do the underneath bit of my hair and
I couldn't get kind of precise with it
so I never got these and I actually love
these these are kind of normal size they
do tiny ones for like men's hair as well
and big ones but these are the kind of
medium size and they're black I think
they might be like a limited edition but
I love ghd's I went I know when I first
started straightening my hair
straighteners but all for me so they
were really really awful and then ghd's
came out and they were so much better so
I've never really tried anything since
I'm sure there are other ones that
it's goodbye now but I've never felt the
need to try any others because I've
always got on really well charities they
make my hand really silky smooth and
they make straightening really easy and
quick so I love those the next thing is
sort of makeup storage and the first one
is from Muji and it's this kind of
perspex holder I think it's meant to be
for your desk for stationery but I use
it for brushes and it basically has four
compartments very safe out sonically so
you can kind of see that's like one
rectangle compartment and I don't know
these for my brushes so these guys live
on my Beauty desk or whatever it is and
I think it's really good it's perfect
it's exactly what I was looking for I
got it about a year ago I think and I
really love it you can put stones at the
bottom so that the brushes stand up
better but I don't really mind just kind
of having them in there so that first of
I can't know how much it was I should I
find the link and put it below I love
that for brushes though and I also have
a couple of empty candles I keep kind of
my face brushes all in one and I try and
group them the next thing is this
lipstick holder and looks like this it
basically has like a little slant here
so that you can always be dusty so you
can leave it kind of leans towards you
like that on your table and then it has
12 slots and I keep my 12 kind of
favorite of the moment lipsticks and
keep this on I guess because I have a
whole drawer to look for us and I can't
go into the drawer like every time so I
just have my favorite kind of 12
lipsticks here and it's really good just
has little compartments and they slot in
perfectly and I got this from the
holding company there's one in London
and there's a website so you can order
online I'll leave the link that's below
it's perfect exactly what I was looking
for you can search for hours on eBay for
things like this but I just thought I
don't really like find stuff on eBay so
I'm happy that I found this kind of in a
store and and there's so much amazing
storage stuff and the holding company I
really like this I just have kind of
Revlon lip butter in a masculine stipple
I sell glossy stain a fresh sugar lip
balm to do your lipsticks
and then six matte lipsticks and those
are kind of all my
at the moment so I love this in this
kind of it's just in front of my brushes
the next thing a muslin cloth and I
couldn't live without them I use them
every kind of morning and evening when I
wash my face I use a mixture of Liz L
muslin clusters I have when I bought the
cleanse and polish it came with a couple
but if I needed to buy more kind of
cloths like this I just go to the baby
department in like John Lewis or Phoenix
they sell my muslin cloth obviously
people use them for babies and some of
them are really big but you just cut
them up I think it's a much cheaper way
than buying kind of fill adult ones I
also have Sarah Chapman kind of flannel
e type things so these kind of go on
your hand like this and one side smooth
on one sides more exfoliating and these
are quite nice to use with the cleanser
as well and they do kind of slip off
your hand so I tend to just kind of hold
them like that but I really like that it
came in a pack of five I think
and I've washed these loads and they
still go in so these are quite a good
little investment I think then something
for nails you know I love my nail
dotting tools I've spoken about these
before I got them from Amazon for like
two pounds it's like the cheapest thing
I've ever bought that I used so much and
you just get five nails asti tools with
different sized dots on both sides and I
use these all the time even if I'm just
doing dots you know I'm not that good at
nails but it's quite fun to play around
with them and I'm really happy I bought
these I use them a lot so the next one
is a really weird one but it is very
important to me and it's this little
plastic key spoon thing and if this came
with kind of a travel set or you ain't
get the little travelpod this came with
it and I use this every morning and
every evening because I hate products
that come in pots and so my favorite
products do like my origins moisturizer
that I use in the morning and evening
and I hate sticking my finger in it and
it all gets in your nail and it's so
messy so I just use this to scoop a
little bit of the moisturizer I'll put
it on the back of my hand and then use
it from there and I use this all the
time so even though it's really crappy
cheap piece of nothing it's very
important to me obviously you can kind
of use anything I just happen to have
this around but it's nice to have a
little scooper because I hate sticking
my finger in the pot so that's one of my
most used beauty tools the next eyelash
curlers and although I don't use these
very often
I have quite curly lashes anyway if I've
got a night out or a special occasion
and then I do because it does make a big
difference and these are the Schumer
eyelash curlers these are I think some
of the best around so I know the Chanel
ones meant to be quite good as well but
I'm pretty sure everyone lovely loves
these and I got these absolutely years
ago because my friend used to work with
Schumer and she gave them to me and
years and years ago and they've still
lost you have to change the robbery a
bit every now and again but they're
really really good Kylie my eyelashes
does freak me out a bit so I didn't do
it that often but I'm very impressed
when I do use these and then obviously
makeup brushes are really important
Beauty tools for me I'm not going to go
through my whole collection but I'm
showing my top 5 which I'm sure you all
know by now anyway Real Techniques
stippling brush I use a foundation will
techniques blush brush a bronzer
japanesse three to four I use for
blusher Mac t17 I used that eyeshadow a
lot and the Mac two to four I used for
concealer and those are my most used
brushes that I absolutely love the final
thing is a latent any crystal nail file
comes as a nice little case and it
basically looks like that and it's kind
of a things made out of glass basically
I hate filing nails my older sister has
a massive photo of it I'm not that bad
but I've always hated fighting nails
that makes me cringe and I'm a nail
biter so I always kind of avoided it and
just bit my nails instead which is gross
I know but this code change my mind it's
so much nicer to use a crystal nail file
if you don't like file your nails you
should try this I think if you really
really don't like it then it's not going
to make any better because it's still a
little bit kind of cringy but it's much
smoother and softer and less harsh and I
just hate nail files so I really really
like this crystal nail file and I think
it's a nice little investment as well
and it comes in a case so you can keep
it all nice and yeah it's just made my
nails feel in much better condition so I
really like that and that's my top ten
beauty tools so I hope you liked seeing
all of those and they've moved the

under my name I'm not really sure
