video of the season it's in
collaboration with Zalando and they
asked me to pick a few items from their
websites to work into my current
wardrobe it's part of their share your
style campaign there are loads of brands
to pick from so I really hope you guys
like the items that I chose first up are
these shoes from whistles I love these
they're just black leather slip-ons
they're really comfortable and they
pretty much go with every outfit next up
is this coat by Kiyomi it comes in three
colors but I chose the light grey it's
really soft
I love the button detail I love the
large pockets and it's a really good
length for my height
it goes on
I wanted this bag from whistles for so
long it's the large Verity backpack in
black it's leather it's beautiful and I
love that it could fit my laptop and my
notebook in that's really important
so I put these all together along with a
basic gray sweater and my black skinny
jeans so let me show you how I did my
makeup and nails first of all I use the
nails Inc Alice and Olivia nail polish
in midnight Merlot this is a beautiful
or Tumnus shade and you only need one
coat
for my makeup I started by using the
benefit Air Patrol eye primer and then I
use my by Terry misty rock eyeshadow all
over the lid and under VI
I lay it on my favorite clinic mascara
and use the lower lash mascara for a bit
of extra drama for my blush I used
Illamasqua and naked rose and then on my
lips i use the charlotte tilbury matte
lipstick in love liberty so that's the
final look all put together if you'd
also like to share your style feel free
to upload your outfit photo on to
instagram and let me know what you guys
think i really hope you like this thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
