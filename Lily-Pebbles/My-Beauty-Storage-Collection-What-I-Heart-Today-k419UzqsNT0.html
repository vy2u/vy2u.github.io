beauty storage and collection it's
mainly about the storage how I store my
daily make up the bulk of my makeup my
skincare and my hair care and also my
nails but I'm going to show you some
products as I go through as well so I
really hope you enjoy it and thanks so
much for watching
I stole all my nail polish in the back
of my office door and this I bought from
The Container Store in America
annoyingly I haven't found anything
similar in the UK but it's perfect it
hands on the back of the door
it's meant for shoes and it has these
clear pocket it has 24 pockets so I put
all my nail polish in and I do it by
color rather than finish because that's
just what I prefer but on the top line I
have base coats top coats nail care
cuticle care nail files nail polish
remover things like that and then I go
from dark to light so I've got my blacks
my dark greens my dark blues and then
dark purple dark reds and then it goes
on to true reds and oranges reds and
then coral and then peach and then
carrying on it goes on to Pink's and
then on to light Pink's then blue and
then greeny mint blue and then more
greens and then lilacs and nude colored
beiges browns and then topes and then
it's kind of a mix of gold and shimmers
yellows and then a few glitter polishes
I didn't really know where else to put
some of my favorites include the stash
treats top coats which I can't be
without actually love it so fast drying
and the Sally Hansen gel cuticle remover
is really good as well really easy to
use so I really like that the Clinique
happy hearts nail polish is a really
lovely bright coral and I also really
like the berry I'm jelly in papaya which
I've been wearing a lot recently and
then I also got the bottle and and fibre
which is a nice mint green which is
perfect for spring so now it's my
bedroom and this is where I keep my
daily makeup that I used so everyday and
this container is from Muji I got the
two drawers and then the one on top is
separate but they're all the wide fit on
the side I keep my hand sanitizer from
soap &amp;amp; Glory and also the quarterly
beauty elixir and then I have my Clarins
fixed makeup spray and an urban decay
setting spray as well so I just keep
those there on the side in case I need
them on top of the storage I keep the
foundations that I'm using at the moment
so I'm trying out the Bourjois healthy
mix and what
China should say their foundation and
then the Giorgio Armani luminous silk
foundation which I actually really like
in the top section here I keep any
products that I knew that I want to try
out or products that I want to use up
because they're just they're on display
for me to use so what the doctor luhan's

Stila convertible cheek cream cheek
blusher and the Kevyn Aucoin sculpting
powder which I really like as well I've
also got a wire sell lip stain which is
a beautiful color and I'm trying to use
up my origins mascara so I've got that
in there as well then in the second row
I've got some more kind of daily
essentials like my Bobbi Brown corrector
which I use every single day I've
actually got two in there cuz I just
bought a new one and also my blink clear
brow gel which I use every single day it
just means that easier to grab if
they're right there I've also got my
Laura Mercier primer tiny bit left in
that pot and then in the third drawer
just a few more bits like the Laura
Mercier rock radiance primer which I
really liked and a couple of brown
eyeliners like my pixie and make up

those days where you need a bit powder

every day that is really easy so I keep
that bear and I keep my brushes sorry
they're so dirty but I keep them in

but it's so good and the drawers open so
smoothly I just love it there is a
smaller one as well which is like half
the size so on the top I keep my
perfumes I have a lot of perfumes I love
perfume but a couple of my favorites are
