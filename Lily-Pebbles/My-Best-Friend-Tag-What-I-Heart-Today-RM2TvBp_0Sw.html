friend Keisha hi we're gonna do the best
friend tag I have a little group of best
friends I've known my whole life so I
have to say Keisha's one of my best
friends because I know that a few people
are gonna have a go at me when they
watch this um so yeah we're gonna get
started because there's quite a few
questions so the first one I'm just
looking down here at my laptop and how
and when did you meet we went when we
were 4 in reception in the reception at
confrim Reese cool screen class green
class Isis man easy yeah teachers good
mrs. my name's ease are we only for just
like family years ago now 20 years ago
fancy years to decade that is crazy
zero at primary school together and they
were at different schools and different
you knees but we stayed in touch
couldn't get rid of her and the same
questions what's your favorite memory
together I know mine we used to go to my
house and like being our socks and
potential like skate around as if we
were in oh this is old onto the
soundtrack of cats the musical oh she
made he had this kitchen I had like
Reese um like the there was a called the
work surface like all the way around and
some reason it was always really
slippery on the floor so he's getting
sauce looks like he said an ice king
tenders like an ice skate he's never
even seen cats yet we know the entire
soundtrack just from pretending so weird
her mom used to come in and would be
like educating around our kitchen I
complete weirdos to Cass okay third
questions describe each other in one
word I think I described you is innocent
cuz she's pretty like doesn't mean harm
to anybody if that make sense like if
she does like to piss you off isn't done
on purpose she just doesn't haven't
realized English ah Lilly in one word is
genuine I think what you see refer is
what you get so by X what's your dream
job I think we have to answer what we
think other person would answer that
yours would be modeling oh yeah I'm
doing it and then I'm you also be
blogging
yeah Omega fifth question what's your
favorite
cut brand I think it would be like I I
lose NARS yeah definitely nice and like
some few laura mercier product yeah and
then yours
you just have makeup everywhere I can
eyes as yell if he knows about something
matter already pick one matte lipsticks
you like yeah I think now's would be one
of them mmm what is something that
annoys you about the other person
it's like shit-stirrer Syrian tag isn't
it um I think what and something that
annoys me but not like it annoys me
he's just quite naive and like the best
way to get best example of this is like
if he is in a bar and the guy comes up
tears like hey what's a pretty girl like
you doing in a bottle and it should be
like oh here my friends like sure and so
she says no idea this guys don't like
shower up or anything so no I can't like
leave her alone for a minute that's
totally true so that can be is not
annoying but yeah okay but I know
exactly what you're gonna say about me
it's particular I think I say that I'm
own no Lily knows what she wants and if
it doesn't go that way thing it's not
going any other way yeah I do that one
if you could go anywhere in the world
together where would it be and why I
think we've already been we went on
quite a few holidays together groups
like France and Israel is always really
good because you've done it I think I
think would be something like smile and
they both be both being Thailand
separately and like love it I do love it
I know yeah I love this like my favorite
place ever
so I think that I think has been really
cool it's good to get that proper
traveling not like in a luxury hotel
like yeah chopper do Thailand like go
everywhere got elephants and stuff I
concur yeah favorite inside joke I think
it's such a stupid question because
you've none of you gonna get get it
you're going to think we can anyway it
is
we don't really have an inside joke
which is boring we just have funny
memories of us doing weird things like
there's a bit then it's dinner then and
there and a tree
that's our inside joke I don't know if
anyone gets that it's not really a joke
really
and who takes longer to get ready in the
morning oh dear that's definitely you we
were in Israel and she has the entire
vanity unit just full of her like day
products midday products past like
midday products I'm I taught about that
word yes but to be fair the reason is
because Keisha wakes up in the morning
she's like hmm what it good to sleep let
me just flush my cheeks with a wet wipe
and I'm ready to go a little bit of
mascara doesn't need any friggin makeup
that's why we're going back to the pool
to like sweat and tan and swim and she's
like oh let me just put some of the
sauce and what did you do this you sure
it's don't of stands next question
favorite season I think yours is summer
yeah I like being hot and I would say
your winter person so like to snuggle
down with blankets and layers
I like missing I like winter kiss is my
birthday then but I think if I had to
pick a favorite season it would be like
now like spring right but more like June
just kind of summer but I don't like
when it's boiling hot in London because
you can't really walk around in short
shorts so I try to be able to wear jeans
and like a top and she wore once it's a
lot is that favorite song we have a
joint favorite so I have one together
definitely doing that thing you do look
good thick Eddy warn you to nothing you
do the film which I don't even know if
anyone knows how to film that around a
very good one and I think your favorite
film song song oh you're very song um I
don't know but you're slightly cheesy
like and I like the belt is even I can't
sing she likes the cheesy love song on
the shower mine you to play don't know
you probably Devi know your own favorite
song you've got
like a huge genre of is it by Eagles now
I do like the Eagles let's go on to the
next question next what is it like being
best friends as someone who's obsessed
with YouTube I'm going to change up to
blogging because I'm not really upset
YouTube
I had to schedule this meeting through
Twitter and just now like schedule
meaner diaries show he's on a Twitter
phone but I'm really bad at phoning
friends I know I am so yeah voice in
Switzer we sent a messages of Ike
something to do then like few hours
later or question mark does it reply to
me she's like oh sorry I'm going to
report not very good life at heels or
flats your heels yeah but not like
stiletto stilettos more like these hills
hmm that's what she's wearing now on
like a random day whereas I'm barefoot
she's a flat I'm definitely flats I
don't wear anything is uncomfortable
even if their heels they have to be
comfy heels hmm and pants or dresses
like trousers or dresses your trousers
yeah you would be I said tights with
little dresses but yeah it's not an
option I think I'd always go for jeans
first cuz it's just easy favorite animal
platypus is a plaintiff is obsession is
a real animal yes so it doesn't Bend in
animals oh it's not a ZX No or unicorn
no platypus icky I think he's just
favorite animals a platypus well she
just wrote she won't admit it she's
embarrassed white is it we don't even
have a reason for platypus being one of
my favorite and a river just remember
thinking that cute yeah you should know
my favorite animal every single birthday
cake since I was five dolphin key she
loves dolphin
lover dolphin I remember I swimming with
dolphins and she didn't talk to me so
jealous I still haven't done it
what's my favorite I don't really think
I have one thank God cuz I can't think
of one I think I like monkeys keep ones
but I wouldn't call it my favorite
animal if your house is burning down
what would you save and why one thing in
brackets if your family was already safe

would save like things you've had your
whole life like it was like bracelet do
you have things like that I don't know I
don't know anything you she's not very
materialistic
Keisha so I don't think you'd save
anything
Oh as long as your family safe you
really like good luck that yeah me on
the other hand you would definitely save
your camera and your laptop I'd
definitely saved my camera own laptop

things
