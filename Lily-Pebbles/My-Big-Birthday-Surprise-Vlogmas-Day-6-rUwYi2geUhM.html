and excuse my face I have no makeup on
and my hair is wet I've just washed my
hair it's actually like half 11 this is
very rare for me on a Saturday but
people probably gonna stay in most today
to prepare for tonight which is got out
to get some bits like Prosecco and I'm
just having like a rare moment of peace
that I'm really enjoying and I'm just
catching up with Twitter and vlogmas
videos all the videos in my subscription
box and had much time to watch them
recently
normally I'm quite good at keeping up
with my subscription box on YouTube I
kind of watch all the videos that I
subscribe to because when I'm do eye
makeup and hair I always have one on so
I'm just kind of chilling and I got the
room a bit ready this morning I'll show
you that when I go downstairs and last
night we cooked the brookey's oh my god
they taste so good I will insert some
clips here of us like rolling the dough
up and putting all the icing sugar on
and then you put them in the oven for
literally like 10 minutes and they're
just the most amazing they look really
impressive and they taste so good so
looking forward to eating those later
and yeah I'll vlog when I get out of my
bedroom and do something interesting
I'm just watching Anna's November
favorites cuz I haven't had time yet and
oh my god her makeup she's wearing
half-baked from The Naked 1 palette and
like a dark ready lipstick I'm
definitely gonna wear this makeup
tonight for my birthday
kay after about 500 hours I've washed
and straightened my hair you go
downstairs to see what everyone's doing
ok so this is what I've done to the room
so far move the sofa back here and put
nice cushions and throws it's comfy and
then I've put loads of blankets down on
the floor and put some big cushions as
well and we're gonna put a coffee table
here so it's kind of like a low table
kind of shenanigan over here we've got
some drinks gonna put some more out
glasses and using plastic because you
know I don't want the washing up I'm
just gonna chuck them away afterwards
it's all the food's gonna go on here I
think it's gonna be pretty cool and cozy
I can add more everyone or and ething
and chat scene
the whole thing in my birthday one I
wanted people to not have to spend lots
of money that was very important and I
just like to be chilled like most people
coming tonight I've known my whole life
I've said it 1 don't dress up come in
like comfy tracks it buttons it is once
you've really relaxed
fine and not like a dinner party just
like a common eat food and chat and
chill so hopefully that's what it's
gonna be like I'm just making some lunch
we should turn this down and I'm gonna
start preparing the veggies a lid that
I'm making so the tomatoes are in the
oven roasting and I'm gonna make the
asparagus and courgette as well and then
it just all goes on rockin and nice with
a nice dressing so I've been eating
spelt pasta recently I was getting a
really bad like stomach cramps every
time I ate pasta this finger I'm
year now but I kind of ignored it
because I love clusters at my favorite
meal but then I thought I'd try spell
pasta just to see in it I feel so much
better after it so I've just kind of
continued to eat spelt pasta and I've
notice is actually then it cooks a lot
quicker then white pesto don't know if
that's like a thing but it's like ready
now it's really quick so that is my
favorite discovery of this year I'm
having pesto with pesto which is like
the most simple boring basic thing but
the kids always eat em I almost jealous
it's really like nostalgic so I'm gonna
enjoy this for lunch
rich is back from the supermarket and he
found the Prosecco deal six bottles
twenty four pounds from Asda yeah that's
amazing
Hey look I just saw this Carly's been
knitting that is hilarious just pop it
into it now damn it what else did you
get put that you gonna put these outside
okay Bridget oh boy it's so cold today
and hey you got random fruit I feel like
everything you got it's drink-related
that's like nine yeah I'm guessing
drinks coke in Inkster cranberry juice
pineapple juice and I want some of this
now okay the tomatoes are out and
they're looking nice and roasted I think
I might need to sample one of these just
in case they're poisonous I'm gonna go
for a little one I'm sorry I just need
to know if they're poisonous or not I
don't know I'm just the best things
they're like brownies but the edges like
crispy like a cookie
nose oh god I'm gonna eat them all we're
just shy decide where to put another set
of twinkle lights we got some there and
I think they look a bit lonely that's
gonna put some more there but we also
might put them across here that might be
quite a nice idea
actually I think we should do that okay
like scattered them along here like
bundles well do it across and then we'll
come back down okay
it might just sit and I come back this
is gonna look pretty but Kara hilarious
these things all that my mom has I think
she got them from America so they're
little tea candles that go in there but
they're fake but it's fake flame and
then you switch the light on underneath
I mean it's ridiculous it looks fake but
from a distance I guess it just adds a
bit of warm glow and it's fake flickers
Osten it's hilarious if you're scared of
fire get some of these use this bowl for
the salad and put all the rocket in
there cuz I think that'll be nice I
really like rocket but I can see why a
lot of people don't quite pepperoni okay
we're gonna go out to get some paper
straws and some like greenery to
decorate the room I don't want to do my
makeup because I want to do later so I
didn't really throw out without makeup
on just because I feel nicer with it but
I think I'm going to fully fine no one
actually cares but for me I'm so
obsessed with this coat at the moment
it's a sauce and it's like cream or
white ombre it goes down to like gray I
think it's very like winter wonderland s
can we just drive for two guys who have
a van and they're selling Christmas
trees out the van so Richard just jumped
out to ask them if they have any like
bits that fallen off because that's all
we're looking for it's like little green
bits to decorate a piano so let's see
they might think he's a complete weirdo
then I'm gonna pop into Tigers to get
some paper straws this is what I love
about London you really don't have to go
far before you're kind of in the
countryside
idiso horses and sheep and feels nice
the Christmas tree thing was a fail and
Tiger didn't have any papers a garden
center and it's looking very Christmasy
I don't really know what we've come for
but let's go in look at this cute little
reindeer thing but it likes to look at
see if they have my name cuz when I was
younger they never had it but now it
seems to quite a common name see they do
have it they know they used to have
little mice a little thing which we're
not getting the tree now are you looking
for if they do this which is six pounds
and we can like cut it up and put it on
the piano
woohoo we need like berries and stuff
they do these things but I'm not massive
leaf fan they're gonna get these to put
on the greenery wow we just drove past
what used to be my local blockbusters a
miniature talking about how funny is it
we used to rent when I used to rent
videos and then I Sorrenti V DS and that
doesn't even feel like that long ago but
the whole like process of going to rent
a DVD or a video and then having to take
it back like drop it through the
letterbox I used to always forget and
get charged it seems so like ancient now
it's so weird to think that that was
like our generation renting films let me
know if you used to also rent films from
blockbusters it doesn't feel I think
they will shut down now but it's quite
sad where they kind of miss it
oh my guys it is so wrinkly it's like an
old man egg okay losing my makeup now so
I can go downstairs get the room ready
light candles and not feel stressed
about having to get ready as I said not
dressing up I think I might do I make up
quite nice there just because it's kind
of fun to do it I like doing my makeup
this so I'm going to use the new Lancome
hydrating illuminating base Burberry
foundation NARS concealer maybe some
makeup forever concealer if I need it
Charlotte Tilbury bronze &amp;amp; Glow
Charlotte Tilbury blusher naked palette
I'm going to use half-baked because
inspired me to get this palette out
again skaara haven't got the scholar out
another browse okay
brow wiz clear brow gel which was scar
or should i use i might see own which
like spare mascara is i have because i
have more in here yeah I saw one I might
use this and then maybe clinic what some
lash mascara and I think this lipstick
for Mac's from one of their older
collections it's matte and it's kind of
raspberry red fat though this many
eyeshadow brushes and none of them are
clean and shows how much I hate having
tossed my brushes it's like a struggle
to find one that is clean excuse the
messy room I'm literally wearing
leggings a slouchy dress and a slouchy
jumper that's how good friends we all
are
no one cares okay I'm just gonna finish
sorting out the room now I'm gonna put
the greenery and the little mini baubles
like along the top of the piano and
maybe round there and there I've also
lit my jo Malone pomegranate no our
candle and this one from neon which is
their pine mer atma and lime peen not
God lime peel I can't talk they both
soon already Christmassy
so that should be nice I'm going to put
my lipstick like towards near at the
time I really love how these two eco
lights look definitely we should keep
these here we have some more hilarious
candles these ones even looked like they
have a wick but they actually turn on
underneath oh gosh that's a toy and they
flicker so I'm gonna put these like up
here I think the amount of fake fire
going on in this house is intense I like
to call this tacky chic so I put all the
greenery out with the red and gold
baubles I put some over here as well and
I think it looks pretty pretty but a so
just try the salmon there's a nice and
try the asparagus donut things to get it
don't don't let this face look good oops
sorry yes
yep this is the best thing for parties
get some of these already cooked
cocktail sausages and cover them with
honey and whole-grain mustard and then
you put them in the oven just to heat
them up for like five minutes ten
minutes and they taste amazing okay AC
Mason wants a sausage let's get him on
even better once we've done them there
you go all right honey is going on
great splurge of honey green mustard now
I'm gonna mix all together than my hands
but I'm gonna have to put you guys down
a lot of hands
when the sausages are prepped and we're
going to put them in last minute you
want this to be hot and then Ben is just
finishing off the salmon and cucumber
salad cucumbers okay okay
I suddenly realized I hadn't made a
playlist yet of music so I think the
room is ready now there's music playing
but I'll quickly show you everything's
done and we've got some food out over
there I think this vlog is gonna be
really weird and like mishmash E and
tonight I don't know what we'll get
flogged and what we'll know I'm gonna
sit my friends if you see the camera
feel free to grab it I I do wanna film
stuff but I also kind of want to just
enjoy myself so hopefully I'll have some
stuff to film and hopefully this vlog
won't be too short or too long it's
always really hard to tell I'm excited

glass of Prosecco and from here on out I

shocked well everyone's gone now at the
end of the night and I had such a lovely
evening I just have such a nice group of
like best friends and we played games
and we had lots of yummy food and drink
everyone made such nice food and then at
the end Keshia just walked in and I
thought hope the whole bill is probably
really confusing on camera but he she
lives in New York and she wasn't meant
to be coming back till the to
mid-january and she was in Paris for a
job so she came down to London for like
a day and it was perfect timing with my
little party so she just walked in and
apparently I just kind of looked at her
like so confused the whole room and
choir and I just seemed when everyone
else is in on it and I looked SJ and I
was like did you know just like know
we're all so shocked it was so nice see
how funny she was like a hologram and I
burst into tears obviously I don't see
always surprise as well but I had such a
lovely evening live cake and Sun to me

nice and now exhausted we've done a bit
