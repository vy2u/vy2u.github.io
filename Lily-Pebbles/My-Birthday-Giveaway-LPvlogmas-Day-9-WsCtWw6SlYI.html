went wild it was really really fun I've
woken up in the beautiful shooting Glen
like look at this room with all the
light coming in and it's been up really
early very organized
I literally woke but we're gonna go get
some breakfast and then I think I'm
gonna head back because my birthday I
want to see rich and my mom and then
tonight I'm going out for dinner with
friends it should be fun why do I arms
her oh my god here my arms hurt from the
shooting was really heavy gone yeah and
the dancing like every year but for the
past few years I'm always just
overwhelmed with the lovely birthday
tweetsie you guys 70's and thank you

I don't know wish me happy birthday it's
insane and very very lovely so thank you
neons not feeling too great
understatement breakfast kind of sorted

gonna film a beauty chat video and well
I don't give anything away because
you'll see it on Anna's channel when's
it going up next Wednesday apparently so
she's set up here we're gonna sit here
maybe I can like put the camera
somewhere
you guys can sit here
I'm wearing my new M&amp;amp;S Christmas jumper
today that I absolutely love over
someone in the toilet thing I think I'm
mad
the sequin Santa's it's a beautiful day
it's meat boy and sunny which is nice my
birthday I'm not getting back in the car
with Georgia and Lisi and driving back
to London and then I'm going to see rich
and my mom's looking around we've
stopped at a service station like
halfway to London please get some lunch
I'm hungry I know when I get home
there's no food at home Oh prison George
said we all feel a bit slow and sluggish
today my legs hurt all that exercise
yesterday really got me I just feel like
my dream and the honey ma soeur here
thanks rich I'm gonna open my presents
but I'll come back to you after as I
show you what I got cause I'm gonna open
them with these two monkeys websites
attorneys so many presents who's this
one from stopping you my mom got me a
loom Eli I'm so happy
Annie uses this hopefully will make me
wake up earlier in the morning and this
is a mess that we've made aces opening
my card for me see who this one's from
they've been very good helpers the kids
have just gone with their madness and I
still love the balloon so much it's so
cool literally always wanted a ceiling
full of balloons such a weird like
fantasy of mine I'll show you what I got
I got a few present my mom got me quite
a few things just really sweet because
she said I'm not getting a stocking this
year so she got me this little makeup
bag says maybe she's born with it maybe
it's an Instagram filter Joey's in
charge of bottoms from Topshop because I
really need some new chassis bottoms and
rich got me these earrings he wants to
take me shopping to like get some stuff
that I want but in the meantime you got
me these nice little gold earrings which
are very sweet my mom also got me these
like little tea light candle holders
that like copper
tea light holders which is really nice
my sister got me from Oliver bonus it's
like gold of the glass mirrored jewelry
case
this week but stationary or whatever and
then as I just showed you my mom got me
a loom me like really excited to try
this and feeling very lucky I just
realized there's a banner that does
happy first but yeah it's good 28 year
olds for me to have banners so I I've
been sitting and editing for the past
couple of hours it's taken much longer
than I thought just because I did so
much yesterday it's quite a hard one to
edit probably not why I wanted to be
doing on my birthday but I'm gonna get
ready soon and then we can go out for
dinner the balloons are starting to drop
slowly which is sad I feel like I need
to film the one more time just to
appreciate them also look how weird
balloons are when they're like nearly
dead can you see how it's like hovering
some reason that really creeps me out
ghost balloon I'm gonna get ready now
for dinner I didn't I'm gonna dress up
that much we're going to honey in Co
it's not a dressy place and we've got 15
people come in but they're all like my
best friends so I don't really need to
dress up for them we get rich too and
set up the loony light oh it's so cold
and a flat it just makes me want to cry
just topping up my makeup but I'm not
really doing it properly I shouldn't
feel that great again which isn't good
but it's fine anyway just talking up my
makeup as I said it's just friends I'm
not really making that much of an effort
but as I was applying my highlighter I
suddenly remembered I've got a giveaway
for you guys today I thought it's my
birthday and I'm getting lots of
presents I thought I'd give one to you
guys too and when this video goes up it
will be the 10th of December which means
that space and K in the UK are finally
stalking Becca champagne pop which is
the Jaclyn hill highlighter and copy tea
we'll have it on the 17th so really
exciting you guys know it's my favorite
highlighter at the moment so I thought
as a gift to you guys I'd do a little
giveaway and I've got three of these to
give away I know it's not many
considering how many of you there are
but it's better than none I thought so
I've got three up for grabs and YouTube
don't really allow competitions so don't
comment asking to win or anything but if
you want to head over to Twitter really
sorry if you don't have Twitter
I don't you give away that often so I'm
just going to go with the whole Twitter
thing but head over to my Twitter which
is at Lily pebbles and retweet
the tweet promoted this video so it'll
be like new video vlog immersed day 9
retweet that link to my video and that
will enter you into the giveaway if you
want to kind of tweet me it's saying the
event or just sorry I know because maybe
not everyone who retweeted entered I
don't know this is all sounding very
complicated now
but basically head over Twitter enter
the competition of info in the
description box and then I'll pick 3
winners to win a Becca champagne pop
already for dinner so we're gonna head
off an hour but early and I'm not really
sure we haven't got any any plans of
what we're gonna do when we get there
early but maybe we'll find somewhere to
cap a drink I'm gonna whisper come I'm
really embarrassing my brightness on
Warren Street
which having an interesting bear
blurring self-identify image like I'm
drunk I'm zooming in
boys have made up their own little game
that's it boys gonna smash it well not
literally blintz
we finished in and just said bye to
everyone and it was so good delicious
food
I'm giving Ana remark a lift back to the
hotel everyone enjoyed dinner all right
I'm gonna head home I see guys when I
get home my driving can you open the
boot so I put the bag there I got loads
of presents even though I said no
presents so spoiled we just got home and
it's like a balloon graveyard in here
pretty much all of them have dropped all
over the lounge oh god I'm so tired I've
had such a lovely birthday there's been
chills
no gonna lie next year I probably won't
get drunk the night before my birthday
because I've been feeling it's not so
great all day but I had a really nice
dinner with my friends it's just such a
nice group of people and everyone
enjoyed it such nice food I think my
highlight was definitely walking into
this room filled with balloons because I
only Richwood know that one of my weird
fantasies is having a room filled with
helium balloons and I bloody loved it
so that was my highlight of the day rich
do you ever thought of the day we need
it we know I thought fine don't force it
just if you haven't thought you have a
thought if you don't you don't bond we
would I used to go clean away and I'm
now dancing around the room but thank
you guys for watching vlogmas day 9 I
will see you tomorrow
tomorrow not having a fun Christmas
another Christmas party it's mad I
literally have no one free evening now
until Christmas but it's with Clarins
and it should be really nice so i'll see
you guys tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
