special guest my boyfriend rich hi guys
I'm here today with a nice nice to meet
you hi guys I'm here today with a very
special guest my boyfriend rich hello
and today I'm finally doing one of my
most requested videos which is my
boyfriend does my makeup tag and I'm
kind of freaking out a little bit I've
put out all my makeup in front of him
here and I haven't written it too nice
because I'm petrified you're gonna ruin
all my makeup no seconds I think you're
gonna quite good at this
Wow let's see so basically yeah let me
tie my hair up so you don't like get
makeup in my hair and I'm just gonna let
rich do whatever you want I don't even
know if you know what half this stuff is
no but I recognize that what is lipstick
okay so let's face just what else would
you do like neck I'm not gonna tell you
anything I'm just gonna let you do it
okay so let's go right okay so the first
thing that looks appealing to me and I
think is the correct thing to use is
this it's the piece of French usual
healthy mix mixed of fruits whole cup of
utensils there for you to use put on the
bra no we got this I've got this okay
and there's a little middle finger
finger less pressure ring finger ring
finger you tell you I cream yeah so I'm
gonna squeeze a little bit okay better
start small I put on both my heart rate
says if you could feel it right now how
do I feel and then right I'm gonna put
it on the cheek and then sort of
brushing or moving outwards that's quite
good actually yeah
and I guess and you just want to just
cover the face yeah I said it's really
uncomfortable doing on that finger well
that's the fingers ready to play your
eye cream would never sit fundage motor
so you know you want to get safe okay
no just use fingers you do your nose as
well do whatever you think I need
foundation I'm try not to use that much
just in case you freak out it's fine
it's I did actually put a wire sell
foundation out as well but also do
better foundation done yeah high-five I
thought I just see that far so I didn't
know right all right what's next
wait let me just familiarize myself with
these skin base massage is everything in
French oh well wake me up yeah let's
wake you up that's Rimmel London let's
consider right you can't swear I'm sorry
sorry mum could see it see that visible
if you have instructions on it which I
know you're looking for instructions one
of them instruction so I'm gonna put
this around her eyes some business gonna
sort of lighten up a bit I forgot you're
a lefty this is kind of good place I
should be interested on the other side
do you use it brush to what do we owe
this is like there's loads more going on
I'll stop oh sorry
ring finger down I'm basically putting
that on her so sorry
so just gonna go out there on a high
bridge in the nose
might as well and then so so I and then
down to the nose
it's nice fluid motion that this is
quite fun still moving I
never had like I didn't like
professionals doing my makeup this is a
whole nother experience I'm gonna need
some extra weight your wrinkle creams
I'm gonna use a brush okay yeah this is
good this is a Samantha Chapman brush
techniques I don't know what this is
achieving but feels like I should be
doing this right I've done the base yeah
he's drinking for instructions on all of
the products so at the moment he's
holding the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer
in its hand just so you know what it's
doing down there
it's going in my eyes just like
spreading them does this just yeah what
do you think this does does it like
prepares your skin is it for the makeup
it's like a primer so it kind of gets
rid of all makes it all nice clean
surface and nice like brushing my
eyebrows in the opposite direction
that's the worst feeling ever
okay done that okay you enjoying this do
I have to use all these products no
right I spice and so we need to add Oh
what's this so the first thing we've got
here is holding as the Urban Decay vice
palette and I've also put my own MAC
eyeshadow palette so take your pick
Mac's gone sorry Mac okay I is this more
expensive no this is fighter looks like
my neutral palette garden-like Mutual's
so I I'm gonna go for the eye next I'll
prime them okay any thinking he's gone
for this brush the one that do yes you
blue still like I had to blow okay I'm
working from the inside out but I think
I've worked from the inside too much
we're going for that brush working for
you fine
it's quite detailed
losing Penny Lane from the Urban Decay
vice palette which is kind of like a
shimmery gold ice color Tanya I'm just
doing other eye that's really hard
my audience is this do you guys--do
let's bring it around a bit so good all
right
do we need to add like another bit just
no right this good that's like a
blending brush I want blending because I
want to add another train to it so gunk
white gold so I'm gonna start with okays
of gold dark desperation desperation
which is the second from darkest color
in the palette so I'm just gonna put it
in the inside just to sort of take the
edge off the top look into my eye brows
yeah just to tone it down a bit
not there we go that's all we need just
from the inside out
okay yeah that is quite cool that's
quite cool like so darky goldie going
but right moving on
I think we've done eyes I done done with
eye shadow yes so now I know you do use
a pencil okay
I'm bit scared about this can you do it
like inside your iron I don't want to
pick it right out cuz we've gone quite
dark a lot on your eye I need to bring
your eyes out well you know the colors
up yeah I'm trying to think what to make
cuz you want I've done it made it quite
dark brown brown it matches your eyes
alright so I'm gonna put this Mac Teddy

eyeliner close my eyes no no you know
what I'm doing with this I don't know
what to wait now your work having
everything krytus see you oh yeah I've
got it
you don't just above your eyelashes so
he got under stops creasing up
this is not what you use a pencil for
I'm gonna flick I'm really sorry but
it's not what it's coming out where I
would imagine if you go on top I close
my eyes if you go underneath I'll open
them open them okay please yes I don't
bitch get up close to my eye open the
keys a brush to blend it right yeah
that's about it
this brush yeah it's not blending

that again so maybe the top first start
from the inside you don't need to play
much with this stuff do you oh look at
that line wait let's do a tick this
tough one please that put I leave my eye
that don't poke me in the eye right oh
my god I could like see your info that's
fine
I'm almost done almost done I just need
to blend it yeah you're shaking no no
I'm resting your arm on my head how
isn't you makeup artist I imagine right
I think whose scar okay I knew what
mascara is mascara is no what is that
there's no table that says mascara oh
yeah right it's the origins ginseng
brightening mascara to lengthen and lift
so you do like just to get rid of all
the clumps yes I'm just gonna do tops
just like flick it slowly not like okay
quite therapeutic this how'd you get
right in right to the core of your
eyelashes to the bottom coconut
I was quite nice I gave you a mascara
that I'm sorry I see to the book bottoms
I don't my lashes
that's it why just wanted to do a little
inside brace yourself
no cuz I don't want you to put my arm
out that is fine just okay
this takes four hit but isn't it now you
know I've gotta go through every morning
no whoa whoa whoa whoa that's a good one
got that bottom how do you flick up when
the bottom ones would you flick go down
yeah it stop poking because that ends
let's put up Donna yes so because I just
got someone your nose blending time just
have to get that little bit of mascara
done done okay so face I'm gonna use out
of these three these are the lips so
just lip and cheek only do forehead
first so I think amis this what's that
you know it's not like one use a crane
like different things look at them
compared we talked about NARS Laguna and
benefit coralista they do different jobs
right but they're different cut it
what's that Brown what's that pink you
don't brown and pink going on dear right
so I'm gonna get quite a big brush
alright work small what what do these
big ones do so many people on the brush
the more kind of blending you can get
smaller the more like intense okay so
I'm gonna go halfway use this one okay
that expert face brush place Samantha
Chapman so I'm gonna do use the what's
this one coralista benefit coralista so
I'm gonna start with the top of the head
I don't know what this is achieving but
I feel like what is this product like
what type of product is it it's is it
like a to emphasize your features oh no
why my knees on your forehead then so it
should be using my cheeks just under
how's the brush working for you well
takes a lot of effort to see something
there's a reason for that
alright using your own brush and say
vamonos yes wait this is quite good out
she turn around look at me

teas arranged cheek like the bottom yeah
