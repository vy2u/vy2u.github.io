bathroom so I'm really sorry if it's
echoey but I'm in the most beautiful
hotel is called shootin Glen and here
for our Christmas party so I thought
really quickly I have 15 minutes till I
need to be other drinks I thought I
would just talk you through my Christmas
party look instead of doing to get ready
with me I just thought I'd sit and chat
because you know it's vlog missed period
I feel like we're getting to know each
other better so I can just sit chat to
you guys and kind of talk you through
not everything but a few bits have come
together to make my Christmas look which
by the way I just did in about 15
minutes I'm very impressed with myself
so makeup-wise let me show you what I've
been using this makeup bag is from lily
and Lionel and completely obsessed with
it at the moment is beautiful it's got
the little rose gold logo there i'll
just talk you through a few bits that
i've used as my base i use this from
becca it's the backlight timing filter
and i really really like this adds a
very subtle glow without being too
shimmery at all it's really subtle very
pretty on the skin it's like a liquid
highlighter but I think you can use this
all over the skin so I use that all over
first before using my foundation which
today I went for the burberry foundation
this is the fresh glow foundation just
because I've into something light fresh
and glowing I really like it I do have a
few spots here just like hormonal spots
but i think my skin looks pretty good
apart from that so it's quite a light
foundation but you can build it up if
you need to apart from concealer and all
those other things i also use her powder
just because the primer and foundation
and very glowy and juhi this is the
laura mercier invisible and loose
setting powder books recently and i love
it it makes the skin at really soft see
if you're going to then contour and use
blush it's really good to stop that kind
of dragging on your skin it's completely
invisible I like to just use a bit in
the lid use a tiny amount and it really
sets the makeup without looking cakey at
all I really hope that Ed Cowan is an
annoying you guys but obviously for
highlighter i use becca champagne pop
it's my favorite highlighter without a
doubt and good news it's coming to the
UK it's going to be in spacing hey from
the
tenth of December so it's already out
and then Colt beauty from the 17th of
december i think so that's really really
exciting a beautiful golden highlighter
i can't recommend it enough I've spoken
about it a load of times you just need a
tiny amount on the cheekbones and it's
so pretty for my lips I've used my
favorite combo I was gonna do a red lip
but the dress I'm wearing is quite like
saucy so I didn't want to go to like
Jessica Rabbit I've just used mac sort
lip pencil and madmen lipstick which I
really think is the best combo so many
of you guys have tweeted me saying that
you've gone out of all these to you love
it so I'm really happy I think it's a
pretty good recommendation I've used
quite a few products for my new NOS
palette you may have seen this I talked
about it one of my vlogs nars and aldine
refillable palettes this is the large
one and I've got some really nice for us
in here like some the Laguna bronzer
which I used and I use the deep throat
blush today and I also use this
eyeshadow top right here i will link all
the products i use down below a really
nice gold all over the lid and then i
used i think i used cork in the crease
and maybe a bit this brown as well
really really nice i made a kind of
brownie gold and base on the eyes and
then I went on top with this eyeshadow
which I crack out every year i think i
use this in last years and years eve
tutorial it's from urban decay and it's
diamond dog it's just the most beautiful
glittery taupe eyeshadow perfect for
christmas parties and news eve parties I
just use my finger and dab it on my lid
and it has silver flecks in it so it
makes your tile is looks like you went
and I absolutely love it so that's kind
of the highlights of my makeup I didn't
want to talk through everything I called
my hair like I usually do with my ghd
straighteners put a bit of all bad right
texturizing spray in for a bit of over
they need a bit more actually and then I
just use my mumble mumble semi sumo on
the ends I
they finish this I never thought I would
finish like a hair wax but I use this
every day before getting ready I gave my
legs for quick epilation is that the
word you guys know that I liked epple 8
this is the bronze silk epil 9 this is
the one I use it actually ran out of
battery halfway through using it so that
was a bit of disaster good job it's
going to be dark tonight but yeah that's
what I used on my legs and I think I
gave them a bit of a moisturize with
whatever is in the hotel and i spritz on
a bit of the German over that green bay
this is the travel size that I got in my
head week calendar and I love it my
dress is from Topshop it's quite
different to something I would normally
wear it's a lace dress with long lace
arms and a sheer panel in the middle I
would never get my stomach out but you
can't really see skin it just gives a
really nice silhouette the stress is a
lot tighter than what you usually wear
but I tried it on and it made me feel
great so I just bought it and I thought
it's perfect for a Christmas party the
parties in the hotel's it's not like I'm
going out I really like it and I'm not
sure yet which shoes to pair it with I
have three options I have my flat steve
madden boots which will kind of make
that outfit a little bit more casual
which I quite like I don't wanna be too
over the top and dressy and these are
really comfortable I have my hi June
boots these are actually quite
comfortable for high boots just black
boots with a heel and a gold sit and
then I have my new kind of flat paint
and shoes from office to have the cutout
on the side and I try this all on all
the shoes look good so I'll just see
near the time which ones I decide to
wear and you guys will probably see in
the cutaway or in my vlog what I end up
wearing to go with my dress I'm wearing
my new Saint Laurent bag and you may
have seen this in my vlog I absolutely
love it it's a very mini bag it's black
leather quite like tough and durable has
a beautiful gold logo is quite likely
logo heavy but I feel like if you're
going with like what I sell a Chanel
band that's okay it's got a really nice
gold chain you can either way like when
your shoulder crossbody or you could
tuck it in and just wear it as a clutch
bag and it is a little bag but tonight
one carrying is my phone my hotel
card and my vlogging camera because I am
vlogging every day at the moment I
really really love this bag and I think
goes perfectly with the dress I really
hope you guys are enjoying my vlogmas
vlogs at the moment if you don't know
i'm logging every day uploading every
day at 630pm i have made a playlist of
log masala so you wanna catch up or
watch them all in one go you can do so
there so I think that's everything for
my Christmas party look and I hope you
guys enjoyed just a quick kind of talk
is very something a bit different sorry
I didn't show myself like applying the
products but I was just having quite a
nice time drinking champagne and getting
ready and I thought you wouldn't mind a
quick sit down video instead thanks
again for all your lovely comments on my
vlog and I'm going to go and party the
night to the way so i'll see you in my
next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
