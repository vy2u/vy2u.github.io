blusher collection I've become a bit of
a blusher addict it's really bad I've
just counted in about 15 blushes which
is loads for someone who's not a makeup
artist I'm just using them on me it's
far too many but I love them so I
thought I'd go through and show you all
the different blushes that I have so
I've got two brushes from benefits
that's these two well I'll start with
this one so this is hervana this is one
of the main things I dislike about it
actually is an example because of the
magnet everything gets stuck to this
blusher this is my two kirby grips stuck
which is really annoying
never eat I pick up there's nothing
different stuck to it so that's what I'm
so this is the new blusher from benefit
Havanna
I did a blog post about this sore link
it below and I go into much more detail
about what I think of it it just looks
like this so that's nice it's very
purpley tone blusher
I really like benefit brushes I don't
really use that for long enough yet to
have a proper opinion on it the other
blush benefit blush I have is coral
Easter and that looks like this
I absolutely love this it's one of my
favorite blushes that I have its Coralie
peachy color I mean it has got slight
shimmer in it on if I can show you my
finger you're not the red see that my
finger so it's got quite a bit of a
shimmer to it this is really nice in the
summer it's just perfect for my skin I
just like brush it on doesn't look too
much it's really natural I really really
like this one and and I use the lid to
swish around so don't get too much on
I've got two Mac brushes
the first one is blush baby which looks
like this this is probably the most
natural blush that I have I wear this
every day to work it's really easy just
to put it on and it looks really nice
and natural this is a sheer tone blush
the other blush I have is a sheer tone
shimmer blusher and it's trace gold
I bought this ages ago it just sort of
on a whim and I actually find it really
hard to wear this it's quite nice in the
summer bye
have these it was a highlighter it's
basically a gold I don't know if you can
see on my finger it's like a gold
shimmer so I couldn't actually use it as
a blush because it's sort of more of a
bronzer of me but it's nice to use as a
highlighter when I'm gonna holiday
especially when I when I was hand but
yet this one doesn't get much use so
that might have been a bit of a waste of
a purchase two blushes from tart please
I bought these when I was in America in
Sephora I think I'd seen I know from
Viviana does makeup talking about these
and then I looked into it so how
everyone raves about them so these were
top of my list to get in America and the
first so I have his tipsy which when you
look at it it's just like that it just
looks really scary
bright orange but it's not actually as
bright as he think it's sort of a nice
okay that looks really bright as on what
you actually put it on it's not that
bright it's a really nice sort of peachy
coral a slightly orange I'm probably
gonna write it's a lot more in the
summer but I really like it I also love
the packaging
I like like brushes they're sort of
flats like this it's a bit like Gemma
kids cream highlighter I just really
like flats packaging like that it's
really easy the other top I'll show you
how this exposed this is this is a much
more sort of natural plummy brown
blusher I actually got one of these for
my mum as well because if you can kind
of see this is also really easy this is
a bit like blush baby a little bit more
Brown toned and so it this'll be easier
to wear when I'm a bit more tanned but
this is a really nice color and it
really suits my skin tone as well I also
have a little Becca cream blusher
this isn't grapefruit so this is the
beach tint and this is kind of a bit of
strange product I think I'll wear this a
lot more on holiday so it's a creek I
got a little tube like that so it's
really sort of creamy so have to use
your hands to blend in and I haven't
really won it properly yet but I think
on holiday especially for
by the pool on the beach this is really
good product it smells amazing yeah
smells literally smells like grapefruit
really yummy I have one Chanel blusher
this is tweed coral just gonna be hard
for me to show this basically looks like
that it's a bit crappy but yeah so as as
the name suggests a nice corally pink
color and it's quite shimmery this one
so I don't always like to have a shimmer
blush but when I do this is this is
quite nice I bought it years ago so it
doesn't get much use but when I see it
and I fancy wearing it I do it is nice I
have two nos brushes these enough nice
packaging but they do get really dirty
you can see this one's not even hasn't
even got white writing anymore the first
one is deep throat which is obviously
one of the most famous blushes I'm just
really nice pink shimmery it's kind of
like pink and gold in it I think really
nice quite bright on my skin but it's
nice when I fancy wearing something but
brighter is nice in the evenings as well
and I really like this this one the
other NARS blush I have is deuce here I
don't even know if that's how you
pronounce it but that's how I'm gonna
pronounce it and that's this color
I've actually use quite a lot of this I
haven't used it in ages but as you can
see I've sort of reached the bottom and
I'm not gonna say hit pan because I
absolutely hate that saying umm this is
a plum II brownie pink this is a bit
like which was the other one I said this
is a bit like the topped one they're
quite similar so that's really nice as
well it's kind of a more autumn winter
color and I like that as well it's not
too much sugar in that which is really
nice I actually also have a palette from
fashionista and that's I got it one of
the session Easter events and this is a
brand you can get in Superdrug so I have
four
in there or one of the highlights
actually so this one is juicy apricot
this one butterscotch and this one is
I'm so blind I can't see blushing
don't know where the most is this one
juicy apricot it's pretty nice
peachy color I'm going to add some lot
in the summer they're really pigmented
these blushes I don't know if you can
see like that so you only need a tiny
bit but these are really nice and for
the price they're so cheap they're
really good quality and it's nice to
have them in a little palettes get to
take traveling as well another sort of
cheaper blush that I really like you can
get in boots and Superdrug is from the
natural collection this one is in Peach
Melba another I've got a lot of natural
blushes because I work five out of seven
days a week so there's no point buying
things that I only wear in the weekends
so it's get lovely you sell my products
and this Peach Melba really nice natural
summer shade and they're really good
quality these they're like $1.99 or
something really nice really easy to
blend in as well which I really like and
really small to fit in your makeup bag
the packaging is a bit plasticky so
probably a break but it doesn't matter
as long as the products good I've also
got a look beauty blusher which is quite
sweet packaging this is making me blush
this one is in shade 2 which is flush if
I can open it for you which is that so
it's so this is kind of a peachy beige
shade this one has a lot of shimmer in
it
so I'm always there conscious of having
sort of shimmery products because when
you're in this assignment especially it
just looks like wearing loads of makeup
but I have been wearing this in sort of
the winter and another really nice
natural one the packaging is very bulky
so I didn't love that about it it's
really quite big and quite hard to store
like as I said before I really like sort
of when it's just like flat ones like
this like you see the size difference
probably the same amount of product so
but yeah this is very nice and it is
really big so it's easy to swish your
brush around in it
which is nice to sort of new brushes
they go out IMATS
yesterday is the make up for ever
sculpting blush in shade 14 now I went
straight to this because I haven't got
any as you've just seen haven't any
brushes like slightly darker but still
bright this looks a lot Pinker and on
the camera it's kind of more plummy but
really nice dark pink and I don't know
why I just was drawn to the Strayer and
I really wanted to try it looks like
that I did actually try it quickly last
mine it does really sumiyoshi-kai got
quite dark features so it doesn't really
nice another low a nice flat packaging
so I love this packaging and see I'm
really looking forward to trying that
problem and another one I got was
illamasqua cream blush I don't have much
Milla masca and I wouldn't probably
normally buy a cream blush from there
but it was five pounds or IMATS that I
thought was definitely worth trying now
I don't love Illamasqua packaging I
think everyone else does everyone always
raves about it but I think it's what
we're did gothic and I don't like the
corners of this how it goes out like
that and it's very bulky but not
weighted so it feels a bit cheap I don't
know but it was that the cream blushes
are really good so I got this song which
is soap
I can never open it so that's another
shade that I don't have like fact
because everything all my blushes and
natural so I thought I'm at something to
try and get something a bit different so
this is a really nice of bubblegum pink
and this is cream so I'm gonna try
experimenting with cream blushes
hopefully it's getting more spring soon
I say that as the snow is falling
outside my window right now I hope for
the spring come soon like I start
wearing more cream products and this is
really nice and summery so really like
that I think that's all my blushes I'll
quickly show you the brushes that I use
to apply them and I have three brushes
that I use the first one is my Mac one
one three which is this
when I bought this I was obsessed of it
I loved it but then I got the japonesque
three to four which is like this so you
can see the size difference and it just
made me realize that the Mac one is too
small when I use a Mac one I just get on
too much product it's to sort of focus
in that one area where's the japonesque
Oh which is bigger and a lot softer it's
much easier to self brush it on and it
distributes the product it's much easier
so um it's just much softer than the Mac
one so I do use the Mac one sometimes if
specially if I'm using the sort of
lighter blusher it doesn't matter if I
get too much on and then I use this one
but most the time I use my japonesque 3
T 4 which I absolutely love it's so so
soft and the perfect size and I'm
obsessed of it I can't I don't even use
my travel blusher ones anymore for
convenience I have to take this massive
one because this is so good and I also
have the Real Techniques stippling brush
which I originally used from foundation
until I got the buffing brush yesterday
which I no love for foundation and then
I tried using this for cream blushes and
it actually works really well because as
you can see like they have the smaller
bristles at the top so it doesn't get
too much product on it and it just
applies really nicely it's a nice size
um so yeah it's really good and this one
has a little thing on the bottom so you
can sand it on your table and this is a
really good Maltese for a easy
foundation cream blushes highlighters
really good so those are the three
brushes that I use so yeah that's it
that's my blush collection I hope you
