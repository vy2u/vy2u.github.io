Essie nail polish collection a few
people have asked me to do one because
you all know I'm obsessed with SC it was
one of the first brands I got into when
I was a teenager and still by far my
favorite nail polish brand
I have 15 polishes and with my nail
polish I keep some of them out on the
shelf the ones I like to use a lot and
then the rest I keep in a drawer and all
my s deep nail polishes are kept out on
the Shelf because I literally love
wearing them all I do have some from the
new diffusion line and Superdrug which
is $7.99 and I much prefer the brush on
those there it's wider and flatter and
just much easier to use so I really hope
they start changing all of them for that
because they're definitely much better
but they don't have all the colors in
the diffusion line I think it's around
70 so this I still buy from the other
one when I see a color I like so I'm
going to start by doing this or pastels
and brights and then go on to the
neutral colors the first one is the very
popular mint candy apple which is one of
the first ones I've got I got it in the
old version and the new version and it's
just a really lovely mint green color um
yeah definitely my favorite mint green
color I found from any nail polish brand
the next one is borrowed and blue which
is a really cute name or the C for like
wedding stuff and it's just a really
really pale powdery blue which is really
lovely actually I haven't used this
enough but I do really like it the next
one is another blue and it's called
lapis of luxury it's kind of a purpley
blue it's really different actually I do
have an MU aid nail polish which is
similar from the love hearts collection
but apart from that I've never really
seen a color like this and I do really
like it I wear this one a lot the next
one is a really popular shade in it's
called lilac ism and I think everybody
has this one it's a really nice lavender
lilac it actually took me a while to get
this one I didn't get it at first I only
got it when it came out super drug and I
love it I wear it all the time it's
probably my favorite past all nail
polish that I have the next one is one
I'm quite surprised I picked it out
actually it's splash of grenadine
it's a pink purple and it's very barbie
girly which is very unlike me but I do
really like wearing it and it's really
pretty color
and something a bit different because
it's kind of purpley pink rather than
just bright pink the next one again is a
really popular shade cute-as-a-button
which is a bright coral and I love this
one and I think I've been through one
already and this is the second one with
from the diffusion line just a really
lovely bright coral perfect for summer
but I'll share where this all year round
and then the next one is another soft
similar color but a bit lighter and it's
called tart deco so that's cute as a
button that's tart deco so there is less
coral more peachy orange really might
like this one actually
if this cute it's buttons a bit bright
then I always get for this one and then
I'm on some sort of neutral more autumn
winter shades the first one I have is
called cocktail bling and it's a greyish
blue which I quite like it can look a
bit dull on but if you know for
autumn/winter and if I'm wearing quite
like a over-the-top outfit or something
it's quite nice to wear this with it
then I have topless and Barefoot's which
again was one of the first ones I bought
really sort of mutual pinky beige color
good for French manicure good if you
just want to have sort of a natural look
and I really like that one then I have
merino cool which is just gorgeous color
it looks really luxury on and it's sort
of a brownie purple and really really
like this one and wear it a lot and then
which someone would kind of similar is
glamour purse it's a bit more Brown if
you can see then this is Ghana purses
merino cool this is a bit more like
murky Brown which I do like it might
give a Chanel and nail polish I have I
quite like this but again it depends on
my skin tone whether it come a little
bit dull or not but it's a nice of
simple color and then one of the newer
ones I've bought recently is master plan
which is a sort of light gray Brown
similar to the others and yeah this is
quite a nice one again just easy to wear
if I don't want to wear a bright color
in case it clashes
my outfit these sort of colors are
really good and then I have this one
which I have actually lost the label for
but I think I'm guessing that at San
Tropez San Tropez which is always hard
to say um and that's just a really light
beige which is really nice
I haven't once one for ages actually but
I do like it and then the last one it's
a more pinky color and it's not just a
pretty face which is again is very
unlike me it's a very girly color nicer
French manicures which I don't do but
you may and just nice if you want to
have sort of bare nails but not nothing
on them that's a really nice one
so there's all my Essie nail polishes I
hope people enjoy seeing all the colors
that I have I find with all of them I
just need two coats and they last around
four to five days on me if you use a
good base coat and top coat and they all
apply really well equally and I just
really love Essie nail polishes so
