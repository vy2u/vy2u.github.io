makeup tutorial and this is pretty much
how I wear my makeup most days so keep
watching if you want to see how I do it
so the first thing I do is use an SPF
and this SPF 50 from Kiehl's is really
good because it also works as a primer
as well as moisturizing your skin I then
take my foundation which at the moment
is the YSL youth liberator foundation in
B 30 and I've mentioned this before I
really like it because it's got really
good coverage and it leaves your skin
looking really glowing
now it's time to conceal and to do this
I use my Bobbi Brown corrector and my
NARS creamy radiant concealer I use my
Bobbi Brown corrector where I have any
dark parts under my eye usually in the
inner corner and outer corners and just
blend it out with my Real Techniques
setting brush I then use my NARS
concealer over the top and vanilla's
slightly light for me so it's quite
brightening for under the eye and I use
my fingers just to warm it up and blend
it in before buffing it out with the
real techniques setting brush for my
face I like to conceal using the Make Up
For Ever full cover concealer because
this shade is a perfect match for my
skin and it's not too light so it won't
emphasize any blemishes I use my fingers
again just to warm it up and then blend
out using the Real Techniques setting
brush
to set this all in place I then use my
hourglass ambient lighting powder in
diffused lights it's a really nice light
powder that also leaves a really pretty
glow then it's time to set my brows and
for this I just use the matte Brown set
because it doesn't leave any white parts
and it doesn't make them too crispy so
for bronzer and blush I'm going to be
using my new NARS
one-night stand palette and Laguna
bronzer which is the bronzer that I
always use is really nice just for a
natural bronze and then going to use the
darkest blush in the palette which is
the one from the bottom right and just
use this on my cheeks now for my eyes
and we'll start with the Bobbi Brown eye
primer
I've been loving this Bobby Brown rich
chocolate eyeshadow pallete it just has
the most perfect brown shades so I'm
going to start with a light shimmery
shade which is a bit like Mac all that
glitters and then using a darker Brown
into the crease and blend out I also
like to take the brown underneath the
eye
and for liner and mascara I'm going to
using my Makeup Forever aqua liner in 2l
and my Clinique high-impact extreme
Volume Mascara
finally on my lips the Rimmel moisture
renew let's get naked which is a really
nice nude slightly shimmery but it's
quite easy to wear and it's quite sure
so that's the final look I really hope
you enjoyed this simple everyday makeup
tutorial please give the video a thumbs
up if you did and I'll see you next week
so as usual I have a bit of mix of
beauty style and random favorites and
I'm gonna start with the first</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
