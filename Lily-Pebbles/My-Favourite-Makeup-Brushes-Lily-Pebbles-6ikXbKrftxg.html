a really good week so far I always like
to check your comments and emails to
look at what videos and blog posts you
guys want me to do and one that always
seems to come up is a video on my
favorite makeup brushes I think I did do
one back in the day but I haven't done
one for a while so today's video is
gonna be all about my favorite brushes
and then at the end I'll talk about how
to take care of them and look after them
because I think that's something we all
kind of forget to do makeup brushes on
my weakness I think I actually prefer
makeup brushes to makeup which is crazy
but I am obsessed with makeup brushes I
have far too many I need to sort them
out soon but I've managed to kind of
pick out my favorites and they're
probably out quite a few
some people can get away with having two
brushes some people love to have 20
these are just my kind of essentials and
the ones that I feel like I could really
recommend to you guys because I love
them I think they're mainly high-end but
if you could have cheaper ones thrown in
there one thing I would say is that I
like to invest in my tools I feel like
makeup brushes are something that you
can really invest in if you want to so I
have all my favorites here in this pot
this is a little marble kind of cup from
H&amp;amp;M home and I've got a while ago it's
really nice to keep your brushes in if
you want to stop them some kind of
stalling around like that just put some
little stones at the bottom eating it
from like a garden center there's lots
of different ways to store your brushes
I'm gonna have to find a new way I think
when I move if you guys have any good
ideas please let me know okay first of
all let's talk about the Bobbi Brown
full coverage face the brush now I used
to always use the Real Techniques
buffing brush and that comes in their
core collection which is one thing I
find slightly annoying about that brush
is that you can't buy it by itself so if
you want to repurchase it you have to
buy the whole kit that's probably one of
the main reasons I stopped using it the
Real Techniques buffing brush is a great
brush if you want to get started with
the whole like buffing in foundation I
would definitely recommend that one it's
really affordable and it's great this
one is slightly different but it has the
same concept it's slightly round kind of
buffing brush so you buff the foundation
in like circular motions it's a new way
to apply a foundation rather than kind
of painting it on which is something I
never really enjoyed doing I love
applying foundation with my hands but if
you want to be a bit neater and tidier
without the mess it's great to use a
buffing brush this one is a lot softer
than the Real Techniques one and I feel
like it has a bit more movement as well
the hair on the brush is slightly longer
so you can really kind of blend it in
and buff it in and give such a smooth
and flawless finish to your foundation
you can apply it lightly sometimes I
like to spray the brush with a settings
Spray or just a moisturizing spray or
you can really kind of layer up your
foundation and get quite a full coverage
don't be fooled by the name you can
definitely apply a light base with this
brush by the way my brushes aren't clean
I'm just I have such a crazy week this
week this is like the only dab at home
which is why I'm just like in a gray
t-shirt so sorry that they're not clean
but you know we're not all perfect
the next brush I'm going to talk about
is from Real Techniques and this is
their setting brush I haven't had to
repurchase this yet this is the same one
I bought maybe two or three years ago
and not sure when it came out I think
this one comes by itself sorry if I'm
wrong but I don't think it comes in a
set and I think this one was made for
setting powder under your eye around
your nose
but I actually used this for concealer
and it's the best brush for concealer
it's really affordable and I just love
the shape it's slightly pointed at the
top so it's great for getting right into
the inner corners of your eyes and I use
the flat side to kind of pack down under
my eyes around my nose under my chin I
just use this all over for concealer
it's good if you're using like a liquidy
concealer because then you can like buff
it in I'm not sure how well this would
work with creams but I don't see why it
wouldn't the Real Techniques brushes are
synthetic
I think tackle on bristles something
like that but they're really really soft
very easy to clean and this is just this
is definitely one of my favorite brushes
it's a great little brush okay now let's
talk about rmk brushes because these are
kind of a new thing to me over the past
year or so I've always gone into
Selfridges and just gone up to the suku
counter and stroked their brushes
they're so insanely soft Lisa Eldridge
always uses them in her videos and they
look incredible when she uses them on
her skin but I didn't really want to
invest that much in a brush so rmk I
think they might be owned by the same
company they're very very similar to
suku if not the same and they're kind of
like half the price they're still
expensive for makeup brushes but again
if you want to invest I think this is a
really good brand to look into it's a
Japanese brand and I have four of their
brushes actually I think I have six
because I've got doubles of some of
these the first one which I'm absolutely
obsessed with is the cheek brush and the
other ones probably wouldn't be in my
essential kits but I wanted to show you
just to compare to this one and this
would definitely be in my essential kit
it's the cheek brush and I use this both
for bronzer and blusher
you could definitely use this for
highlighter and powder as well so it's a
really versatile brush it's incredibly
soft like a con even explain how soft
this
is is the perfect shape for bronzer just
under your cheekbones or blusher just on
the apples of your cheeks it's great for
setting powder for highlighter it just
does everything and it's so soft and
it's a pleasure to use I feel like you
should enjoy putting on your makeup and
this makes applying your makeup very fun
and very relaxing and enjoyable these
are really easy to wash as well I was
really worried that it wasn't gonna be a
soft after washing it but it dries
perfectly keeps its shape and if you
look after a while this brush will last
you a very long time the other rmk brush
that I probably couldn't be without
which is the newest one for me is an eye
shadow brush and this thing is great
because all of their brushes have really
short handles so they're so good for
traveling they're just so miniatures you
can see I don't personally like it when
brush has a really long handle it's
quite useful if you are makeup artist so
you don't have to like touch people's
faces but if you'll just ply makeup on
yourself I think a little short handle
like this is great the hairs on the eyes
shadow brush that the reason I really
like it because it's quite long I like
quite quite a floppy a shadow brush can
I say that they're like moves around
quite a lot I really like to blend my
eyeshadow out so I don't like it to kind
of pack on too hard I just like to
really blend out and make it softer make
the edges really kind of soft and pretty
this brush again like all the brushes is
so soft I have two of these they are
incredible great if you just want to put
a shadow all over the lid also great to
work into the crease as well if you want
a more affordable version of the RMK
eyes shadow brush then I would recommend
the zoeva luxe crease they do have
another luxe define crease I think it's
called and which is a bit more like the
Mac t17 but this one's slightly longer
like the rmk one and as I said I like my
eye shadow brushes to be a bit longer a
bit more flexible this one is lovely for
blending out they're very similar the
rmk one is slightly softer it's better
quality and it will wash better but well
i've dropped it the zoeva brushes are
great and I have another Zoe for brush
actually over here which I will show you
this one is the luxe petit crease and I
use this one for under the eye I love to
apply eyeshadow under my eye or pretty
much do it every day and this is just
the perfect shape I feel like some
eyeshadow brushes are just too small and
too firm it applies too much shadow it
kind of hurts your eye as well which
this one's really soft it has a lot of
movement again and you can really kind
of soften out the edges and blend
the eyeshadow this is the only brush
that I would recommend for shadow under
the eye it does a job and is perfect one
more eye shadow brush to recommend this
is not an essential and I feel like the
rmk brush would also do this job but I
do love this brush it's from Bobbi Brown
and it's their eye blender it's a lot
bigger than any of the other eyeshadow
brushes I have and this one's great just
for blending out the edges it's so soft
it has so much movement and if you
really want to get that soft edge this
one is great as I said a clean rmk brush
would do the same job
I just have a couple of brushes to go
now this one is from Charlotte Tilbury
and it's the powder and sculpt and I
wasn't sure how I felt about this brush
at first because it's quite pricey and I
was a bit disappointed that it wasn't
that soft it's kind of a bit scratchy
but actually that's really good for
powder because it picks up the pigment
really well sometimes if a brush is too
soft actually doesn't pick up product
that well so this was great for a powder
contour and highlight it's a nice kind
of tapered shape so you can really get
under your cheekbones if you're
contouring and you can kind of use the
the sides as well just to tap on
highlight at the top of your cheekbones
so this one can be used for a few
different types of products you can
probably use it for blush as well but
I'd say that it's too too defined for
bronzer her brushes are really well made
and they've got this kind of edge on
them so they didn't roll off the table
and that's actually I think really handy
roll I say roll like I'm really really
posh I don't know why I say that word my
friends always take the piss out of me
roll I need to learn how to say roll
this is a great brush I was given a
Bobbi Brown travel set at Christmas and
I became absolutely obsessed with this
brush and now I take it everywhere with
me I travel with it but I also use it at
home it seems to be the perfect shape
for highlighter I feel like a lot of
highlighter brushes like brushes that
are sold to work with highlighters are
quite small and dense and I feel like
with powder highlighter it's nice to
kind of really just like gently apply on
the tops of your cheekbones and you need
a really soft brush for that I don't
like to kind of pack it on this brush is
so soft it moves so well and it's got
that kind of long tapered thing going on
it's just amazing and then I looked on
the side and it says she a powder so
technically this is the same brush as
the full-size Bobby Brown sheer powder
but I feel like this one is way kind of
puffier and not as long as this one so I
don't know if these are
quickly the same brush they say they are
I prefer this one this is great for
blusher but a highlighter I really
really like this one they feel very
different I don't know what the
difference is I'll try and look into
that but if you can get your hands on
the travel one that came in the kit at
Christmas then it's great okay so final
brush before I talk about taking care of
them and how to wash them is this one
from Kiko Kiko is a really good
affordable brand it's Italian there's a
shop in Oxford Circus but I think you
can also get it online and I've always
used this brush is called the lips 303rd
it's good IPS but I think the elves were
rubbed off lips 300 and it's a tiny
little brush it's great for thrown in
your handbag because it just looks like
that and then you pull it apart and the
little brush sticks out at the end and I
always use this I used it today to apply
my kind of soft red lip when I'm
applying a red lip I always like to
apply it with a brush so I layer it on I
really define the edge of my lips and
then I blot it with a tissue reapply and
kind of apply from the bullet and that
just makes it last that much longer
so when I need to use a lip brush which
is usually only with a red or a dark
berry I always go for this one I feel
like once use lipstick on a brush it can
really stain other products so it's nice
that once you're done you can kind of
take off on a tissue and then just pop
it back in and it closes so you know
it's not going to make the inside of
your handbag dirty or makeup bag this
was really affordable and it's like one
of my favorite brushes
okay so quickly before you in this video
I'm going to show you how I like to take
care of my brushes and I think if you're
gonna spend money if you're gonna spend
35 pounds on a brush 45 pounds whatever
you want to spend then take care of it
and so many people I know don't wash
their brushes I never did before I
really got into beauty I didn't really
think I knew it was even a thing but
it's so important it's just like
anything else like washing your clothes
you're putting these brushes on your
face so if you want to take care of your
skin and you don't have to spread
bacteria and get spotty it's really
important to wash your brushes seems
like a chore but if you kind of just
make it a routine say every other Sunday
I like to just sit on the side of my
sink watch YouTube videos and I do all
my brushes in one go and it's quite nice
it's nice to use a fresh clean brush in
the morning so if I need to quickly
clean a brush because I'm gonna go out
tonight and do a smoky eye and my
brushes aren't clean then I'll just use
the Mac brush cleanser and I just put
this on a bit of kitchen towel and I
just swirl my brush in it and it just
takes off any
I shadow that's there but I wouldn't
recommend doing this too often it does
kind of dry out your brushes this is
only when I'm desperate like just now
before I filmed I did a few of my eye
shadow brushes so that's called spot
cleaning and what I do when I want to
deep clean my brushes is I use the dr.
Bronner magic soap this one is so gross
because I've nearly finished it this is
the baby mild one but they come in all
different scents
I just bought a rose but I haven't tried
it yet but there's like rose mint almond
so if you want your brushes to have a
scent you can use one of those this one
is just plain and unscented what I do is
turn the tap on kind of warm but not too
warm just kind of room temperature and
it's really important to not get any
water in the funnel I'm pretty sure it's
called the funnel which is this bit
because then it will loosen the hairs
and your brush will start to shed so
whenever you're washing your brush keep
it down so no water kind of trick was up
into this part of the brush it's a
cooler funnel so I can being really
stupid I can't remember it's probably
not so I just run it under the tap a bit
upside down and then I put a tiny bit of
this into the palm of my hand you can
use a glove because if you don't omit
your hand or kind of soapy and then I
just swirl it in the middle of my hand
and you'll see all the kind of color
from the brush come out into your hand
and then rinse it again and just kind of
squeeze it out try to keep it in the
same shape that the brush is in once
you've got out all the product and all
the soap and it's not like any soap left
in there hairs I just lay it kind of
flat on a towel hanging off the table
it's better to kind of have it slightly
tilted down so the water doesn't trickle
in and make sure you reshape the brush
while it's drying so that it's not kind
of one-sided all these brushes that have
recommended wash really well apart from
the Bobbi Brown full coverage brush I
feel like it does go quite stiff and it
takes quite a few days to dry which is a
bit frustrating but all the others wash
really well and if you just try and get
into some kind of routine doing that
every other Sunday night it'll be worth
it because there's no point splashing
out on a brush if you're not really
gonna look after it so I hope you guys
have found this useful so many of you on
Twitter requested this video and I did
tweet saying that I was either gonna
make this video or a video about getting
over my fear of flying so let me know if
you would be interested in a video like
that I feel like I could just sit and
chat about it and maybe not everyone
would relate to it but some of you might
so let me know if you'd like to see that
video too I hope you have a great rest
of your week and I'll see you guys on
Sunday for my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
