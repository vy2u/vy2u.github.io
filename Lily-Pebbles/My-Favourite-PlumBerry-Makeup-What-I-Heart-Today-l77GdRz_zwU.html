going to do a video about berry burgundy
plum shades I'm so sorry if you can hear
background noise my neighbor decided
it's good tan tumors lon and I've waited
about half an hour of him stuff but he's
not going to and I really wanted to film
this video so hopefully you can't hear
that
fingers crossed but I've got so many
products here I went through my makeup
collection like my drawers all my makeup
I picked out every kind of berry plum
shade that I could find that I liked and
I want to talk you through all of them
so I'm gonna get started because there's
loads I don't know how long this video
might end up being I'm gonna start with
nails I just picked out two nail
varnishes these are my favorites and I
said plumberry burgundy because they
were kind of similar to me and similar
source shades
the first one is Revlon VIX and I think
it's cool yeah vixen which is 5/7 oh and
this is a really nice kind of brownie
burgundy color and I think this little
shade on nails is so sophisticated I
love it I feel really grown-up when I
wear this and obviously Revlon's not
that expensive and and I know pleasures
are really good quality and lasts ages I
also really like the brush on them yes
really nice and long a bit like OPI one
so that's a really nice nail polish and
then a bit more expensive high-end is
Deborah Lippmann and this one is just
walk away
Renee which i think is part of Renee
Zellweger's I named common boy so name
is now you know I mean that just Bridget
Jones I think is part of her collection
I'm guessing by the name anyway it's a
very similar color to vixen it may be a
bit more red I love the Deborah Lippmann
bottles as well and really really good
quality nail polishes so I'm yeah that's
also a really nice kind of dark Birkin
burgundy nail polish and I'm gonna talk
about blusher cuz I've only got one
obviously I mean there's not many like
plum burgundy shades you want to put in
your face with this one I have is from
makeup forever and it's shade 14 it's
like one of those sculpting blush and
basically looks like this and it's a
really sort of deep berry raspberry
plummy color and I bought this at IMAX
last year I don't where it loads if I'm
honest just because I'm quite like an
eyeshadow and lipstick ii person so it's
quite hard like when you wear this thing
you have to keep everything else quite
plain but it's not as scary as it looks
actually it's just like a really nice
idea like a really nice pink and if you
just put on lightly and it's really nice
and it really kind of warms up your face
so I really like this one actually and I
like makeup further blushes are quite a
buy more and for eyes I've got quite a
few um the first one is this MAC
eyeshadow and it's cranberry which is
what I recently got and I really like it
and it looks quite scary and I always
wondered how I'd wear it but actually
it's much easier than you think it's a
frost finish and it's kind of as the
name suggests kind of a proceed
cranberry red shimmery kind of color but
it's a beautiful eyeshadow and it's
really nice to wear underneath your eye
in the crease it's just quite easy to
like play around with and you can mix it
with other Browns or I know actually
Tanya Burgess did a tutorial using this
and Club which is another one of my
favorite MAC eyeshadow so you should go
check that out if you want to know like
how to use this in kind of a fun smoky
way but yeah that's a really pretty eye
shadow another one I wear a lot is
illamasqua forgiveness which is a plum
purple color I also have this in a
palette from Illamasqua this is just the
most useful eyeshadow I have it's so
nice all over the eye and it's nice in
the crease I worked a lot underneath
these are plummy colors really seek me
because I'm brunette I think problems
really super intense
um and I just find this a really I think
it's matte these are matte eyeshadow I
just find it so easy to where I love in
a Muscat eyeshadows and this is kind of
a real staple product for me that if I'm
going away on holiday I'll always pack
this with me this is kind of a recent
one for me and I wanted to mention that
I don't haven't used it a lot but I want
to mention it because it's really quite
unique and it's fun the makeup store I
don't know if they're everywhere they're
definitely a few stores in London I've
seen and I don't have a lot for us from
there but I got this in
press bag from an event and it's one of
them micro shutters and it's in scale
and I looked this up on their website
because I tried it and it's like the
weirdest texture it's kind of like
creamy but then it looks powdery and
it's like it's amazing so I lift it up
and it's basically powder eyeshadow that
you can mix with water and use it wet so
you can use it as a liner you can use as
blusher obviously not this stage but
they have like pinky shades it's a real
like multi-use multi-purpose product and
it's just an amazing texture it's really
creamy and soft and easy to blend and
this is really nice to use as a base
under other colors so even though this
one's more purpley than the other side
what really on to dimension this because
I'm definitely going to look into their
other colors because I haven't tried a
lot of makeup store stuff and this is
really cool I like this and then I also
have from Bobbi Brown one of their
long-wear cream eyeshadows and I've
talked about this before and raved about
it this one is velvet plum and 37 and
they come in little glass bottles and
this is just basically like a bronzy
plummy color I apply this with a brush
and it just lasts all day and all right
it's amazing it's properly long where
they're not lying about that
I'm just really nice metallicky color I
love this actually it's quite similar to
the Maybelline creme shadows and I
remember they're called but better
quality obviously because Bobbi Brown is
more expensive and I do prefer this one
but if you want a cheap alternative
I think the Maybelline ones are quite
similar and so that's a really nice
color that one's velvet plum and then
another eyeshadow everywhere in lodz
recently and I'm sure I've mentioned on
here and my blog a lot as well is
Burberry and mulberry which as soon as I
saw it I knew I needed it it looks like
this and it's a kind of topi plum color
and it's beautiful it's got some shimmer
in it I just love wearing this all over
the lid and I find it so easy whenever I
am not sure what to do with my makeup I
always end up just wearing this one and
the texture or perseus Burberry it's
quite expensive for the texture that
eyeshadows
amazing and I really love this it's
perfect for autumn/winter I've literally
been wearing this every day I also have
an eyeliner this one is Avon glimmer
stick diamonds which is one of their
kind of shimmery eyeliners and it kind
of winds up like that this one is in the
shade of sugar plum which is a really
pretty shimmery purple it's very similar
to the bobbi brown eyeshadow but it's a
bit more like glittery but I find plum
eyeliners are really nice if you're
someone who likes to a brown eyeliner on
the top which I do then plums a really
nice alternative because it's very
similar effect but it's kind of just a
bit different and if you just want to
mix it up a bit and I think plum
eyeliners are really lovely and then
another eyeshadow which I think a lot of
you may have this palette I wanted to
mention it if you have the Naked palette
the original one there are a couple of
really nice plummy shades in there as
well toast it and hustle which are these
two here and there's a lighter pink
that's toasted bit more pinky shape then
hustle is kind of a deeper plum color
and these two really nice together so if
you have this palette and you want to
experiment the plum try hustle it's very
shimmery so it's quite shimmery plum
color but really nice really nice to
take it under the eye and into the
crease which is what I like to do is
kind of plumbing eyes shadows really
pretty so try that one oh I feel like
I'm growing really fast but I've got
loads of lip products in front of me so
I want to get on to those and first ones
lip butters which are kind of lip balms
I'm sure you know what lip butters are
by now and Revlon kind of started the
whole craze so I've got three Revlon lip
butters here and these are kind of the
berry shades that they offer
I've got berry smoothie macaroon and
raspberry pie berry smoothie is like one
of my all-time favorites I bought this
in America and I absolutely loved it
it's so easy for everyday wear such a
pretty color macaroon is a bit more like
a brownie berry color
it's definitely got more Brown in it but
not too much that it kind of looks
old-fashioned it's really pretty brown
and raspberry pie has a bit more pink in
it but they're all kind of similar plum
me berry burgundy shades oh and I love
lip of lip butters they're so easy to
wear if you're someone who wants
experiment lipstick small but you're
kind of a bit scared about it and these
are really good cuz they're just kind of
like tinted lip balms and then I have a
couple of like traditional lipsticks
first one is Mac plum full which I'm
actually wearing now I bought this the
other day I was waiting for make for
Megan Isabella d'Este a from SD button
they were going somewhere in Carnaby
Street and I was wandering around that I
ended up buying two matte lipsticks
which I bought this one and on hold
which is very silly of me but I actually
love this lipstick it's the luster
finish which is nice it's quite like
cream machine or however you say it
chrome machine quite creamy and quite
share as well which is nice because many
people put on without mirror and not
worry about it kind of skidding
everywhere but this is just as the name
suggests like a really pretty plum color
and so easy to wear I'm wearing it now I
absolutely love it I know this is gonna
become a favourite of mine and then I
also have Ella massacres and magnetism
which is another one I really like this
is definitely more bold it's a darker
color you have to be a bit more
adventurous to wear this one they
describe it as like a deep raspberry and
but it is quite a dark for us but it's
not like raspberry pink and but I love
this I really really like this and this
kind of then realized how good and
emasculate sticks are such a nice
quality and feels so nice on so yeah
this is definitely a favorite of mine
with sort of berry plum shades I really
like that one and then I've got four
kind of lip crayon e-type products the
first one is one of the Revlon just
bitten kissable balm stains and it is in
the color crush which is like a dark
plum I'm just kind of repeating myself
here with the colors but yeah this is a
pretty pretty dark like violet color but
these are kind of similar lip butters
and they're easy to wearing cuz it's a
crayon it's easy to draw on so it's good
to feel like new to lipsticks this is a
very dark color so you have to kind of
light that looked wear it I also have
one a soap &amp;amp; Glory sexy mother pucker
glow sticks which are very similar but
they're much glossy ER and a bit
in color as well this in kind of looks
just this dark in the bullet or whatever
you call it but when you put it on it's
quite sheer and very glossy so if you
like the sort of glossy lip gloss look
this is really nice and kind of easier
and less sticky than the lip glosses and
they smell amazing really sweet and
yummy and I have to clinic chubby sticks
one is the original chubby stick and
this is in voluptuous violet and this
looks really scary and dark but because
it's the original chubby sticks with
very sheer so this is nice if you want
to kind of try the darker violet colors
but you're not really sure because it's
very faint and you can't see on my hand
it's really faint but really kind of
moisturizing and you still get the same
effect this is not like a solid block of
color it's more like a wash of color and
then I have one of the chubby sticks
intense which are the new ones which are
out now I think pretty sure they are
they're definitely on the website this
is grandis great and I love this one as
soon as I saw it I knew I was gonna love
it it's just like a proper deep
raspberry grape color so pretty
just like the easiest lipstick to wear
everybody just drawn this is always in
my handbag and I'm absolutely loving
this one I'm definitely getting more
into like the darker raspberry grape lip
I'm loving it and really like embracing
it and then the final product where I've
actually reached the end of this I put
so many products in front of me is one
of the wire sell glossy stains which
comes in this really pretty packaging I
mean you can kind of see the color
that's inside this is number 23 I don't
have the name of it it's one of it's
part of their like vintage collection I
think and spent annoying it doesn't have
the name of it on the actual bottle but
this is kind of like a gloss it has like
a little thing like this to apply it I
actually quite like that I find it quite
easy to apply this is quite wet when you
apply it I see anything I wasn't sure
about it left kind of like a wet to mark
around my lips but then I kind of what I
do is I put it on and then I Pat it in
and it kind of dries is like a stain
which means it lasts much longer than
like a
Glaus it just kind of stains of a lips
yeah this is a really nice very similar
to the rest like a dark raspberry pink
plummy color really pretty this is quite
one of the darker ones that I have
because it's kind of a liquid it goes on
quite like solid um it's very kind of
like a vampire II look thing but I
really like it and I like the glossy
stains actually and they're a bit more
like a gloss than anything else but
really nice and worth trying if you'd
like kind of stains and you want your
lipsticks to last longer so that's
everything but I hope you like seeing my
favorite sort of berry plum the shades

the moment really enjoying wearing them
