today's video I would talk through the
YouTube channels that I'm currently
loving because I realized that I watched
YouTube videos every day without fail in
the morning when I'm in bed waking up
when I'm taking off my makeup in the
evening I'm addicted to watching YouTube
videos but I don't often talk about the
channels that I love like you guys know
I love Anna Rose Carolina's loads of
like UT youtubers that you guys know
about but actually most of the time I
watched non Beauty videos as well and
just like a big mix of people from all
over the world so I thought it would be
nice to just kind of share the love talk
through some other channels and then you
guys have some new videos to watch or
maybe you love them already - so the
first channel I'm going to talk about is
clothes encounters and that channel was
run by a lovely girl called Jen in and
I've watched this channel since 2011
when she did videos with Sarah her
friend it was like a joint channel and
then they went to uni I think and they
couldn't film together so now it's just
Jen and I just love her personality
she's obviously so beautiful but I find
her voice so calming and relaxing to
watch her style is just really cool and
different
and now she has a English boyfriend so
she comes to London sometimes and
doesn't cool at UK content she does a
bit of beauty she does fashion quite a
lot and I just find that she's really
positive and smiley without being like
too over-the-top I really like her
personality and I really want to meet
her one day the next channel will come
as no surprise Casey nice that I've
actually watched his videos since 2013
which is before he started daily
vlogging since he started daily vlogging
I think his channels grown like crazy
and everyone watches him now but I
originally found him because of his
studio tour video me and Anna was
talking about this the other day in the
car remember she found him first or I
found him first but we kind of both
discovered him a similar time and just
became obsessed and watched all his
previous videos he used to do like short
films he still sometimes does but now
he's more of a daily vlogger either way
he's a filmmaker who lives in New York
he's a husband and a father I really
like the style of filming and edited and
he's worked in the industry forever so
he just really knows his stuff and he
knows how to capture a moment I find his
stories quite interesting he started
daily vlogging about nine months ago and
then started his new company called beam
which is a bit like snapchat I don't
personally use beam just because it's
not really my kind of thing
but I still love watching his videos and
I watched him every single day the next
channel is will Derbyshire I think I'm
pronouncing the surname correctly I met
will last year at VidCon with his
girlfriend Arden Rose he also has a
really good YouTube channel and he's an
English guy really kind sweet guy and
he's only got 55 videos on his YouTube
channel so I don't know how long it's
been going for but he has a lot that
many videos on there but the ones he has
are really really great
his videos are very arty and thoughtful
they're like kind of short films I
really like his style of filming and
editing and again I find it really
calming and relaxing to watch and very
inspiring as well it makes me kind of
think more about my own video style and
he was definitely a big inspiration for
my skiing vlog that I put up recently
and his girlfriend is the subject of a
lot of his videos and it's really sweet
and they're clearly so in love and it's
just really nice to witness the next
channel is I am Karen oh I think it is
either Karen O or Kirino I don't know
but it's run by a girl called Karen
young she was born in Hong Kong but
raised in America and she is so quirky I
love it I only discovered her channel
quite recently and it's just really
different I don't know what it is is a
key that I like about it but I find it
just quite exciting when she puts up a
video I'm really excited to watch it her
style is just so different to mine that
I really enjoy seeing how she puts
outfits together she's a lot of like
animation in her videos which I wouldn't
even know where to start or how to do
that so I really like that I just think
it's quite cute and fun she is a
stop-motion really well as well and I
think the first video I discovered of
hers was her full lookbook and she like
has the stop motion where she's like
spinning around on the spot and I just
thought it was so cool
the next shot is what's up mums and my
friends always laugh at me when I tell
them this is my favorite YouTube channel
I started watching their videos in 2013
and it's basically a mummy channel it's
wrong by three American mums and it's
like crafty staff a day in the life
videos cooking basically anything to do
with being a mum which obviously I don't
need to know about any of these things
but it's more just the style and editing
of their videos that I love I love the
moms and their personalities and they do
spots of videos so well it's just genius
for moms RL meg and
and they already offer something very
different and it's like a full-on
business now with like an office and
they have staff and I'm really happy for
them they've grown loads over the past
couple of years and I always recommend
their channel to people I really like it
the next channel is The Late Late Show
by James Corden and that's actually a TV
show that runs in America I think it's
on it like midnight and I wouldn't
usually watch something like this but
the reason I really like is because
James Corden is actually an English guy
and he started on a program here called
Gavin &amp;amp; Stacey just a normal guy that
kind of got into acting and he has done
so well they upload clips onto the
YouTube channel kind of the next day I
think after the show so we don't get to
watch the whole show we see like the
best bits and he does all these really
good skits like carpool karaoke where he
gets really like amazing legends to sing
in the car with him on the way to work
he's had like Adele Stevie Wonder Justin
Bieber and Jason Derulo and actually I
didn't even like Justin Bieber or Jason
Derulo and now I love them so he's done
a lot for them as well he also does a
skit called take a break when he goes
into company or shop or something and
someone takes a break while he takes
over from them and it's just so funny I
don't know if it's just me that really
gets his humor but I find it hilarious
so definitely go and check that out
and then finally Jaclyn hill which I
feel like everyone knows about but when
I discovered her seven months ago when
Anna told me about her I had no idea who
she was and at first I was like well
she's quite like it intense and over the
top but I absolutely love her now I
think she's hilarious and behind it all
she's just a really great makeup artist
the makeup she wears is too much for
what I would wear but I really enjoyed
watching it for like techniques and it's
kind of like a guilty pleasure to watch
someone put quite a lot of makeup on
it's really satisfying I think I watched
her Sephora haul before I went to LA and
that was the first video I watched and
now I'm just obsessed everytime she
uploads I watch it straight away she
recently uploaded her 2015 favorites
that was half an hour long and I watched
the entire thing straight away no breaks
I absolutely loved her I think she's
really pretty and I love her makeup
choices yeah pretty addictive so those
are my current favorite YouTube channels
and I hope you guys found some new ones
to have a look at and enjoy as well let
me know who your favorite youtuber is
obviously not someone that you
I already know because I always want to
find new channels I get that bored or
watching the same thing all the time so
let me know if you have any channel
recommendations leave them in the
comments below and I'll see you guys on
Tuesday for my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
