my hair story you're probably all
thinking what the hell how could she
have a story about her hair it's not
really a story about my hair
I just often get questions about my hair
so I thought I'd explain all the way
from the beginning the stressful life I
have with my hair I think everybody
thinks they have stressful hair but I
think I went I'm sure of it
anyway so where should I begin when I
was little I used to have big curly hair
I mean big big blonde curly hair my mom
used to have to take me to a really
expensive hairdressers just so they
could detangle the curls because she
couldn't do it without the neighbors
coming knocking to wonder why there was
a screaming child screaming so loudly so
that was then let's skip forward to
teenage years so I had very very tight
ringlet curls I'm sure everybody thinks
that's amazing and loved it but of
course I absolutely hated it
my best friend had similar hair but she
had longer and it was sort of a thinner
my was just so thick and so curly it was
just unmanageable I use ozzie shampoo
and conditioners because I like the
smell and I used to use shock waves
extra-strong mousse I don't have one
with me but it's the red shiny bottle
for some reason I had this fear of the
feeling of dry hair to me I think it's
because when your hair no you hairs wet
I mean I think for me some curly hair
hair always looks better when it's wet
sits or thinner it's more weighed down
so I just thought the wet look was the
nice look so I used to wash my hair flip
my head over put in mousse up to about
there and just run it through my hair
scrunch my hair cover every single bit
with her if anyone ever asked me to use
curling cream or anything like that or
spray a freakout because those sort of
products you can't get throughout your
whole hair as mousse you can literally
get every piece of hair I want every
piece of hair it's product on it so I
used to cover up my hair in
and then it would be big curly hair I
see if I can find a photo that I'm not
too embarrassed to show you and put it
in here
so yeah that was my hair I hated it
after about a day I'd have to wash it
again because mousse it used to go so
crunchy and hard and horrible and then
when I was up in a ponytail just like
how to pull on the back of my head oh I
hated it and I always used to use a
product farm Sebastian called Sebastian
wet which is sort of like a gel that
makes her hair look wet again it went
crispy and it was just horrible and I
hated my hair and then started having my
hair relaxed I didn't want it to be dead
straight I just wanted the curls to be
relaxed and my hairdresser advised me I
had think it was a keratin treatment I
used to have them sort of twice two
times or three times a year and when you
can always see when it grows out from
the roots it just got rid of a lot of
frizz it made my hair easier to control
still wasn't that happy with it but it
was sort of easier to manage I think
when I got to about 18 19 I started
straightening my hair
it looked horrific at first I can't blow
dry my hair even to this day it's just
straighten it but after straighten it
more and more and more over the years my
hair as my mum predicted it would and
always said when I was younger don't
worry your hair calm down when you're
older it did calm down a lot and sort of
just as naturally relaxed a lot when I
wear my hair straight I'm sure you've
seen it straight before in video or in
my blog I'll show you the products that
I use so actually shampoo condition is
the same for now right straight and
curly at the moment I'm using OHS on dry
recovery Jameer conditioner because my
hair is really dry and damaged from all
the straightening I have to use really
sort of good quality shampoo and
conditioner and one that really brings a
lot of moisture into the hair and this
one's really nice this is probably like
the thickest most like moisturizing
shampoo and conditioner I've used so
that's a Jean another good one is the
red can extreme line and this is it red
hen extreme shampoo and conditioner
which you can get from fairly unique and
these are also really lovely I'm nearly
finished this one so these are really
nice as well and another one that's
really good for my kind of hair
corn oil because the oil really
moisturizes the hair and such different
means who dry so when I straighten it I
use protector heat protector before I do
and the one I quite like as the video
five smoothly does it so I put that on
for straighten it
I also sometimes use the ozone instant
restorative hair serums put a few drops
on putting things like oil and serums
always really good for my kind of hair
I'm just putting as much moisture back
in as you can because so much is lost I
also really like the frizz ease three
days straight this helps keep it
straight quite a lot and sometimes I use
a serum after the Charles Worthington
frizz free serum I really like it's
really hard I'm sure you've seen in my
hair straight it's always still to this
day hard to get the roots very straight
and it's never gonna look amazing I've
sort of just accepted that but it's
easier to have a straight I know a lot
of people say that my hair looks nicely
curly but having it straight means I
don't have to wash it every day and when
they have a full time job that is
important so I I do still wear it
straight a lot of the time because it's
just easier and I can have endless of
different styles as well another couple
of things I like to use over hair I like
to use a mask sometimes I can't find my
own on one I literally don't know where
it's got I think my mom may have stolen
it
but there's an ozone mask which I've
done a blog post on so I'll link it
below and also the Moroccan oil intense
hydrating mask is really nice as well
just putting a mask on so every other
week really helps my hair and I know
this seems like a lot of products but
that's what I have to go to with my hair
so this is really nice as well also
another thing is the philip kingsley
elasticized this is something you put on
your hair and you put a shower cap on
for like 20 minutes half an hour
whenever it put us is 20 minutes i was
doing at 40 minutes and this sort of
just brings the elasticity back into
your hair and just makes it really nice
so now after all those years of
straightening and do relax I don't get
my hair relaxed anymore my hair isn't
actually chilled out a lot you can see
this is so this is my hair natural now
I'm with Sephora so much
That Ends kind of just like loose waves
but the roots are still really curly
that's just what's driving me mad about
my hair at the moment it probably will
change again now my hair but at the
moment yeah the roots are really curly
tight curls and their ends just loose so
this is the style I'm having to go with
at the moment I'm trying to give my hair
a break from the heat I'm gonna try to
leave it curly for the whole summer I've
set myself a lot of challenge but so far
loads of people have been saying you
hair look so nice curly so it's alright
for me I just have to find time to wash
it more often because when it's straight
I can leave it for like four or five
days anyway it's curly it's pretty much
every other day it needs a wash so what
do I do now when it's curly
I basically wash my hair with the same
time doing conditioner and masks and all
the things I just showed you and then
when I come out I put a towel on my hair
but I have about space of 10 minutes
that's it the most before I put product
on it
I can not leave my hair to dry that
would be a disaster it has to be wet
it's not soaking wet but damp when I put
the product on so the first thing I use
is Sebastian potion 9 this is amazing my
dad uses as well I think every one of my
families as this it's just it says it's
a styling treatment but what I use this
for is just to get moisture in my hair
before I go in with the curling cream I
like this because it's really liquidy so
it's really easy to spread through the
hair what I products do you think it's
really hard to make sure you get all the
hair but this is put two pumps like
fluorescent orange and I just run it
through my whole hair and it smells
amazing and it's just really good for my
hair and then I take the Regis curl look
this is really random product I don't
even know how I discovered this Regis is
like a random hairdresser they have it
in my local and shopping center I think
there's quite a few but I've never
actually had my hair done but I think
once I child tried this curl lock it's a
curling cream and I just really liked it
so I put like two pumps of this and my
hand is quite a thick white cream and
instead of just running it through
because then my hair would just be a bit
stringy I sort of tried to just like
scrunch it I just sort of place
it's on my hair and just make sure I get
all in the roots and just make sure I
get all the hair I only think about four
or five pumps in the end to make sure I
get it everywhere and then I think it
leaves my hair quite nice now I've got
over the whole kneading my hair to look
wet and crispy thing I think it's nice
when it sort of has that dry itchy wave
look and I am actually quite happy with
how my hair is at the moment I think my
friends and family would find that
hilarious because I've had such hair
issues in the past I used to be such a
freak with my hair um I think I've
sorted it now I mean when it's straight
it's a pain I have to straighten it
every morning even if I go to the
hairdresser and get blow-dried dead
straight I wake up the next morning with
curly hair it's crazy my hair just wants
to be curly so that's pretty much it
my hair is very stressful but I think
I'm getting the hang of it now after 24
years so I hope you found that
interesting and found some products if
you have hair like me I'm very sorry if
you do but if you do that maybe you
found this helpful
and sorry if I spoke really fast there
was loads to get through thanks for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
