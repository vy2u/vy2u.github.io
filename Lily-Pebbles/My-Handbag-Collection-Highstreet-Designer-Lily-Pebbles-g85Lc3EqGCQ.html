my handbag collection video I love
watching these so I thought it was about
time I filmed my own and I've got a mix
of high street and kind of mid-range and
designer bags
I've always been completely obsessed
with handbags from a young age I don't
know what it is it's kind of like my
obsession with scarves I guess a handbag
fits everyone whether you're having a
good day or a bad day handbags are just
the best I love them I've got 12 bags in
total I don't know if that's a lot or
not a lot sounds like loads to me but I
have been quite good over the years at
giving away bags to friends and family
if I'm not wearing them I feel like
there's no point keeping something if
you're not wearing it someone else can
get good use out of it so they have been
bags that you may remember from past
videos that aren't in this collection
that means that my sister's probably
walking around wearing it right now
I have a lot of black bags just a
disclaimer and again that's because I
feel like if I'm going to spend money on
something I want it to be something I
can wear loads it's so much scarier
buying a bag that's like colored but I
do feel like as I'm growing up and
plucking up the courage to be a little
bit more adventurous but I do love black
so let me just get started I'm going to
go from the smallest bag to the biggest
bag and talk through each one I hope I
remember all the details
I don't really haven't done any research
on these bags I'm just gonna kind of
talk through them as I go I have one
clutch bag that's because I feel like I
don't wear clutch bags that often so I
don't need loads and this is just the
perfect clutch bag and it's from
whistles it's black with a gold zip it's
quite big it's aids-like medium-sized
and it's in this black shiny grainy
textured material as I said I haven't
done any research on the materials and
stuff but I really love this you can
just kind of pop it under your arm you
can just hold it if it's quite a lot in
actually I always judge a bag by whether
it can fit my vlogging camera in very
important so you can fit phone camera
keys purse quite a lot in there and even
if it kind of gets quite big I still
think it's nice to just shove under your
armpit or you can just hold it like that
this is the perfect clutch bag okay the
next bag is very special I bought this
last year I've always wanted a Chanel
bag it's something that I feel like I'm
always working up towards for when I'm
older but when it actually comes to it
and I've tried them on I haven't really
found the perfect one because they're
not actually long enough to wear
crossbody and I feel like just wearing
it on the shoulder isn't safe so I saw
this bag for Saint Laurent
I like to put my bags in the dust bags
as well just to protect them because I
store all my bags on a shelf above my
wardrobe I'll insert a clip now of how I
store my bags so they are all out in the
open so for the ones that do have dust
bags I always keep them in I think it's
really important to look after things
that you're spending money on so this is
the bag it's the little black bag with
the gold wire cell logo on it's in a
really tough grainy leather because I
know that if I've got something like a
soft leather it would just scratch and
it would completely devastate me so I
definitely like to get bags in this
grainy leather instead and it's got a
long gold chain and I love this because
you can wear it so many ways you can
wear it on one shoulder you can wear a
crossbody you can tuck the chain in and
wear it as a clutch bag which I've done
quite a few times for weddings it's such
a good bag it is little though I can fit
in this bag a card holder that I put in
my travel card and my debit card and ID
my phone but sometimes I do have to take
the phone case off to squeeze everything
in but it does fit with the phone case
on my keys lipstick mirror doesn't fit
my vlogging camera in probably would fit
the s120 but the canon g7x doesn't fit
so this is what it looks like inside so
it is slightly smaller but not kind of
crazy small it's really nice so good for
events in weddings so smart and timeless
this is sort of bad I'll definitely hand
down to my daughter if I have one and
it's beautiful I love it
Oh another thing about this bag I really
like is you can wear it with a really
casual outfit and I still think it looks
really cool you can kind of dress it up
with a smart outfit if you're just
wearing a bomber and a t-shirt and jeans
it also looks really good okay the next
bag is from brandy melville which is an
American store I think but there has
come over to London there's now quite a
few around London and I bought this
maybe last summer summer before it's a
very kind of floppy bag it's not the
best quality but it's a crossbody or
shoulder bag with kind of gold hardware
and black tassels those called tassels
this is what I like to call the perfect
Festool bag I like that I'm not really
worried about damaging this because it
wasn't expensive at all it was like 20
quid or something it looks really cool
and casual the only annoying thing is
the zip broke so it's quite hard to open
but I definitely kept it because it's
such a good kind of spring/summer bag
you could fit quite a lot in life
like cameras purses all of that and
probably more maybe like a single scarf
as well really like slouchy I just like
the way this looks and I wore it to
every festival and gig things that I
went to loss summer this next bag is by
a brand called olive Cooper and this bag
was gifted to me so when I say
something's gifted to me that means it
was sent to me for free there's no
obligation for me to talk about these
things and I wish them to say no if I
think it's not something I'm going to
like but she asked me if I would like to
be said in this bag and this was maybe
last year and it looked really really
nice it's real leather and it's so so
soft but again has that slightly grainy
finish so it's not going to get cut
damaged it's got gold hardware which is
my favorite I love gold and again can be
crossbody or shoulder and it's quite a
nice little kind of square size it has
this buckle and then it has a magnetic
clasp and there as well and then quite a
lot of space in there with zip as well I
don't wear this one as much as my other
bags but it's really good if I just want
simple black crossbody bag it's smart
has OC written here and it's a really
nice bag I like supporting kind of
smaller companies and olive to put is a
really nice brand the next bag another
black crossbody bag but they are my most
worn by far this is from Urban
Outfitters it's part faux leather part
fro suede so this top bit is suede and
the rest is leather it has a pretty
tassel on the zip and then it has a zip
that goes all around and it opens like
this as well it has two compartments
three compartments sorry one in the
middle one in the front one of the
middle and one at the back so you can
fit quite a lot in there I like the
shape it's a little bit different you
can wear crossbody or on the shoulder
again one of those bags I can wear when
I know I'd have to worry about my bag
getting damaged or stolen I would be
upset if I got it stolen but it wasn't
really expensive it was probably about
30 pounds I really like the tassels it's
very kind of summery and really easy to
wear my last black crossbody bag is this
one from Strawberry of Scotland I
mentioned this in my most warden style
items video if you haven't seen that I
will link that video here I basically
talked through all my most worn items
for my wardrobe and this bag is
definitely one of those this bag was
gifted to me by sloth be of Scotland is
a really nice brand and I think the
style of the bags is very
into anything else I've seen I'm pretty
sure it's based on the old kind of
musical musical musicians bag because my
friend Jake mentioned that he's an opera
singer anyway it looks like this this
one can be worn crossbody on the
shoulder and it's got silver hardware
which isn't my favorite but it's good if
I want now option this metal bar here
flips over and this handle stays at the
back like this and it's got the logo at
the back there and then this flaps up
and that's where you keep everything
inside it's quite structured I like that
it's quite structured it's a bit
different my other bags are all a bit
like flimsy and floppy this one's
definitely more structured and I think
it's so sweet and just such a classic
style that really goes with any outfit I
like that it stands up on its own and
you can like put it down on table or
something such a nice bag and I have a
slightly larger bag from the brand as
well which I'll show you in a minute
this is my most recent purchase I bought
this when I was in Paris or Paris
Fashion Week when I buy an expensive bag
which isn't that often I really do my
research the one thing I definitely
don't want to do is regret buying
something I actually went round to my
friend Amelia's house Amelia Liana
because she had a couple of bags that I
was interested in and she said come
around try them on it's absolutely fine
which is so good because sometimes going
into the stores can be quite
intimidating so it was nice to have to
try them on and hear from her what she
thinks of the bags I really wanted to
get the YSL sack d'Azur I think it's
called but when I actually saw it in
real life it's so small and you can't
really fit much in and it kind of hurts
your hand when you're trying to get
things in and out of the bag and I don't
want it to be anything negative about
the purchase so that immediately kind of
put me off it also doesn't do up which
in London you have to be quite careful
if your bags open because I get the tube
a lot so I then looked at her saline bag
and it's called the Nano luggage tote
I'm pretty sure I didn't think the
colour that she had would be available
because she bought a couple of years ago
but I was just looking at the style and
I really really liked it and then when I
was in Paris because it is slightly more
affordable to buy it in Paris for some
reason I went in to have a look and they
actually had is that good same color as
Amelia's which is the one that I really
really loved so sorry for pretty much
copying you Amelia but this bag is
beautiful so as I said it's called the
Nano luggage tote I keep it in the dust
bag as well and it looks like this
mine is slightly different
years because they've changed the fabric
on the side here or the type of leather
so it looks like this these handles are
really structured and they kind of stay
like that and it's tricolor so it's got
this beautiful blue on the side you guys
know I love like a cobalt blue it's kind
of beige color here and then black and
it's got gold hardware there was another
kind of light gray bag that I liked but
it had silver hardware which I just
don't wear as much this bag has the
strap that's long enough to wear
crossbody and on the shoulder it falls
perfectly when I wear it crossbody like
slightly higher than my other bags I
really like that feels so safe and as
you can see the bag kind of looks like a
little robot face which is quite cute it
also has a zip to keep things safe now
what I love most about this bag and I've
heard people say this before because I'm
obsessed with watching like unboxing
videos before I buy a bag it's pretty
much a magical bag and I mean that
because it has so much storage space
inside it looks like quite a small bag
but I can fit my notebook in here I can
fit my like big camera in here it's like
a never-ending pit of storage I've got
stuff in there now but seriously I can't
explain to you how much you can fit in
here you really can just pack it full I
don't know how they did that in the
design but something they've done in the
design is genius because you can fit so
much in this bag I'm really really happy
with it and that's the best thing when
you make a purchase and then you're
really happy with it such a good bag and
I wear it all the time and I was brave
enough not to get black so it's actually
like a bit of a statement bag I love it
well you know it's getting nearer to
spring when you get really hot filming
if you saw I was wearing on my bottom
half right now you would love so much
okay so moving on I have another bag
from strawberry of Scotland this one was
gifted to me by the brand it's the
medium size and it's navy blue I like
having navy blue bags slightly different
to black but still kind of goes with the
theme again silver hardware and this one
opens slightly different still has the
bar that slips over the handle but it
doesn't have that flap it just has a
magnet and then it opens like that
there's a zip and a pocket inside and
you can fit quite a lot in here I love
this bag this is probably the one I wear
the most day-to-day you can wear it
crossbody or on your shoulder so
comfortable really soft leather stands
up by itself can't quite fit my laptop
in here which is a little bit annoying
but you can fit kind of note
books and cameras and anything else you
need I have two backpacks
I love backpacks because they're so
handy you can literally use your arms
for anything while carrying everything
you need on your back the first one is
from Urban Outfitters I didn't realize
this when I bought it but it's a ripoff
of Rebecca Minkoff I don't recommend
buying fake copies but it's there but
Outfitters so wasn't like from a random
market store I don't know I didn't
realize that it's very similar to
Rebecca Minkoff it's black with gold
hardware it has two pockets either side
and then it has this clasp here that you
can either wear done up like that or you
can clip it down at the bottom as well
and wear it like that and it has a zip
and you can keep quite a lot of stuff in
there this one's a bit more of a stylish
backpack and then I also have my wonton
whistles which is a bit more of a
traveling one because it's much bigger I
think this is called the Verity really
nice soft leather it has a big handle at
the top big flap that kind of folds down
at the front and a large pocket as well
I can fit loads in here I can fit more
in here than the Urban Outfitters one
but as I said this is a bit more like of
a statement backpack so the other one I
can wear kind of like a handbag this one
is more for traveling I think it's so
useful to have a good backpack in your
collection okay two more bags I'm going
to end with the biggest ones this is my
bag from Chloe I think this was the
first designer bag I ever bought and I
think it's called the Riley I can't
quite remember I really love this bag
it's just like a classic black shoulder
bag it's got gold hardware this
beautiful textured leather it has the
pocket on the front here and it's just a
really nice shoulder bag
it doesn't do up so I do have to be
careful when wearing it Albert what I
normally do is have a big scarf that I
just lay on top of all my stuff actually
I have the scarf hid I always use this
purple scarf so I put all my things in
the handbag and then I just stuff the
scarf on top but I think it's just a
really classic bag that won't ever go
out of style and I really love it
and then finally this bag which is from
Aspen all of London they gifted this to
me it's bright blue with silver hardware
such a beautiful color it was limited
edition so I don't think they have it
anymore such a nice bag it's huge though
I mean look it's absolutely massive so I
would only really use this when
traveling the handles are quite short
which means that when it is full and
heavy is quite hard to carry I tend to
like just put it on my wheelie suitcase
and hold it that way
really put it over your shoulder and
there's no long strap to go with it so
it's not that practical in terms of
holding it but I mean look at the color
it's beautiful so so pretty I don't wear
it enough but when I travel I try to use
this because it's so gorgeous so those
are all my handbags and I hope you guys
found this interesting as I said I love
watching handbag collection videos so I
hope you do too let me know which bag is
your favorite and if you have any more
questions about any of the bags please
leave a comment below and I'll try to
reply and if you have any handbags on
your wish list let me know what they are
because I love obsessively watching
unboxing videos thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you guys in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
