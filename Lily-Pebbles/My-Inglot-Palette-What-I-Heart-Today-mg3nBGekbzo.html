Inglot I just came back from Westfield
where I built my own eyeshadow palette
and it was amazing so I wanted to talk
to you about it and show you what I got
so Inglot in case you don't know it's a
Polish brand and they will their
products paraben free they don't test on
animals and I've always sort of been
interested in it they have a lot of
stores in America so quite a lot of the
girls from America and YouTube talk
about Inglot but there's only one store
here so I have been in it a few times in
Westfield but I wasn't really that sure
and I haven't really explored it
properly before so I made it my mission
today to go in and sort of have a look
around and I wanted to make myself a
little palette the idea was to make
myself a palette that would be perfect
if I was like going away then it would
have everything I need in this one
palette and I only wanted five shadows I
didn't want it to be too big so when you
go in are you buying the palettes you
get the actual palette and all the
shadows separate like this you can put
it in yourself they have a thing called
freedom system which means that you can
basically build your own palettes they
have like two three four five ten all
different size palettes for brushes
powders eyeshadows lip products for
everything and you can literally make
anything you want so many different
variations so it can take a while I
spent like an hour in the store but you
get all your shadows and then you can
sort of build your palette at home I'm
gonna insert some footage here from the
actual store in Westfield so as you can
see there's just loads of shadows
everywhere like all the different colors
and you basically get a little magnetic
board and you pick the colors you want
and you put on your board and you sort
of switch and change them around and
then at the end you go to the till and
they give you all the colors that you
want and the palette that you want so
there's so much flexibility there's so
many different products to choose from
they have lipsticks as well and nail
polish and like even their nail polish
the paraben free and there's just so
many different options they have a
little sort of a makeup area we
they could try the products on you the
staff are really really helpful
the lady was really nice who helped me
and sort of them help me pick out a few
colors so yeah the stores it's like it's
quite small store the one in Westfield
but it's got loads of products in there
so this is what the palette looks like I
got the one with five bits like this
really nice size that's why I wanted the
one with five easy to sort of putting
the makeup bag if you're going away and
it's magnetic so you slide this down
this comes off and that's the palette
obviously there's nothing in because I
haven't put mine in yet
it's like quite nice weights I really
like it and these are the shadows these
are what they look like when you get
given them before you put them in the
palette their own like little plastic
things and they're square and there's
loads of products in there the shadows
are 450 each which is amazing I think
that's so reasonable the Mac ones are
like 9 pounds or 10 pounds and there's a
really really good quality I'll show you
in a minute the only problem I have
which isn't a big problem but the
shadows don't have names they're
numbered which I find quite annoying
because it's hard to remember the ones
you like the numbers are just very
confusing and I think it's really nice
and products have names so that's a bit
of shame but apart from that I was
really really impressed
ok so just put my palette together it
was quite fiddly actually you have to
sort of peel off the plastic and then I
started and putting the stickers on the
back so neither name but then looks
really ugly so I've changed it and it
took quite a while to put it together of
an out stun and I think they're
notoriously known to be hard to get out
so make sure you take note of the number
or thigh shadow before you put it in
your palette because otherwise you'll
probably never find out what it is again
without completely ruining the eyeshadow
anyway here is my palette I'm really
really happy with it
it's kind of got I basically before I
went this morning I picked out all my
favourite eyeshadows that I use all the
time and I actually took them with me
and I said these are the colors I want
so this one is sort of quite similar to
the hey sailor mac eyeshadow that I just
got that I wrote a blog post about and
it's this is one of my least favorite
one in the palette cuz I couldn't really
find one exactly like what I wanted I
wanted sort of champagne gold shimmer
all over my eye and this is the most
similar they had this is a they call it
a shine
so I basically I got three pearls one
matte on one shine so this is a really
nice sort of
Goldy shimmer is quite yellowy
and but really nice for all over the lid
they're all really good quality really
highly pigmented and really sort of
buttery soft that's what I really like
about them so that's number 30 and it's
shine this one is three four to it and
it's a mapped so I sort of wanted an
ashy Brown to put in the crease of my
eye and maybe to use as a liner as well
and I think it's always good just to
have a map in there this one is a number
402 and it's a pearl and it's the sort
of
taupey brown little bits of purple quite
similar to satin taupe which is my
all-time favorite eyeshadow from Mac and
the next one is for tutu which is
another pearl and this is a sort of
darker Brown really nice sort of if I
want to make a more smoky eye in the
evening and then I really wanted to get
a green in there this one's number four
one nine and it's pearl as well
I love club for Mac I love wearing sort
of green smokey green eye in the evening
so if I were sort of take this traveling
with me it's nice to have some colours
for the evening as well and green really
suits me because I've got brown eyes
and this is a really nice of olivey
green so I'm really happy with the
colors that I got I think it's so good
for the price and the quality of the eye
shadows are really amazing and it is
quite annoying that there's only one
store in the UK but they do have an
online store so I guess if you watch
like if you wanted to buy a pallet but
you can't get to Westfield just watch
loads of YouTube videos and look at
loads of blog posts for the colors and
then just pick some online and like
thought what's the worst thing that
could happen if they're not quite the
right colors they're only 450 each was
like don't think as loads and to be
honest all the shadows were nice so
you're always gonna have something that
you like but yeah I'm really happy with
my sort of neutral palettes and I'm
really excited to use it so I can put
the lid on like that
and yeah I'm really really happy with
that
so I highly recommend Inglot it was a
really nice experience going to the
store and picking out my eyeshadows and
so I hope you enjoyed this video and
seeing the palette that I picked out and
maybe now you're exploring a lot more
like I did so thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
