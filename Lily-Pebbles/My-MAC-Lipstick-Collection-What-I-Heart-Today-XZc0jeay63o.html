highly requested videos which is my MAC
lipstick collection and I get a lot of
questions about MAC lipsticks and which
ones I recommend and which ones I own so
I just thought I'd show you all the ones
I have when I buy a MAC lipstick I
always look at blogs and videos first so
I thought this might be helpful to some
of you if you haven't seen some of these
shades before I just want to start by
saying I really do like MAC lipsticks I
think they're really good quality I like
the smell which is quite important to me
and it's not quite vanilla II I think
and I just think it's really easy they
have a lot of different shades a lot of
different finishes a Mac section their
lipsticks buy finishes like creme
machine luster so it's the formula of
the lipstick so once you find the one
you like and you get used to the
different formulas it's quite easy to go
and pick up a new lipstick in a shade
that will seat you and I think it can be
really overwhelming going into a MAC
store or onto a counter and trying to
find a new lipstick so my tip for that
would be to just really take your time
don't feel rushed don't worry people
asking if you want help just take your
time trying all the different lipsticks
looking at the finishes working out
which ones you like you can try on
lipsticks in the store they clean them
for you so don't be afraid to ask for
that and do your research first I think
looking at swatches on blogs and tenth
alia has like every swatch for Mac I
think that really helps kind of seen
things online and looking at other
people who have similar skin tones to
you in if it suits them it's probably
likely to see you
so yeah just don't feel too overwhelmed
and don't feel rushed into buying one of
the lipsticks because they are quite
expensive now they've gone up in price
so I think that's quite important
I have 16 lipsticks I think I started
buying matte lipsticks when I was about
14 maybe a bit younger I don't buy them
as often now and when I do buy them I
really kind of think about it first and
so I have some here that I bought at the
beginning that I don't like that much
and some that I really love
there's definitely quite a few that I
bought just because of the hype around
them when I'm in a good mood I'll buy a
lipstick like that it's so easy and I've
got a few really bright colors that I
will never wear but they're the most fun
to buy so I'm definitely guilty of that
so I'm gonna start by talking through
micro machine and I have four of those
creme scenes are just really
moisturizing easy to wear and they're
the kind of lipsticks that I really like
I think that's one of my favorite finish
along with lustre I just find them
really easy to wear I've been
comfortable on the lips so the first one
is creme de nude and this is one that I
don't wear at all anymore I bought it
when I was a lot younger and going to
kind of a nude lip stage and it's just
literally the most nude nude nude ever
it's far too pale for me it looks like
on my concealer on my lips but a lot of
people really like that look so if you
do I don't really recommend this on but
it just doesn't suit me at all makes me
look really ill but performing is really
nice then I have fanfare which is a
pretty summer color and this is like a
very pale peachy pink and it is quite
hard for me to wear this on I feel like
when I wear too kind of pink light pink
colors it it just doesn't really work
with me but I find if I like Pat this
one in the lips I think with most of my
MAC lipsticks if I find that it's not
working kind of rubbing it into my lips
with my finger really helps us not so
it's not so much like a pop of color but
this is a pretty one for the summer kind
of correlates home then I have hot
gossip which I really like it's a bit
more like a deeper pink
it looks quite light in the bullet but
when it goes on my lips it kind of looks
a bit darker and I think that's all
really proceed kind of easy once wear
day or night and I really like wearing
that one actually then there's on hold
which is a newer one for me and it's a
more brighter pink color but not kind of
bluey toned which are the ones that I
kinda need to stay clear of because they
just don't work with my skin tone for
some reason this is a bit more like a
ready pink
and I really like it it has got a bit of
a kind of a pearly finish to it I think
which I'm not sure about I'm not sure if
I like that or not but I find when I can
tap this in with my finger it looks
really nice and this is one I've been
wearing quite a lot recently
then on to my lustre finishes I have
five so this is the most popular finish
in my collection I really like lustre
it's kind of like a Shearer lipstick so
the colors not too strong which means
it's kind of easy to put on for like an
everyday look really easy and
comfortable to wear and they're really
moisturizing as well I think they leave
a bit of a glossy finish the first time
I have a patisserie and this is another
kind of nude lip
I haven't won this for a long time but I
went through stage of wearing a lot
which is why there's not much left of it
it's a pretty nude I think this new kind
of suits been the most out of a lot of
nudes but like I said I haven't worn
nudes in a long time so I don't wear
this that often anymore but I do really
like this one and I'd recommend trying
it if you want a nice nude because it's
not too kind of concealer nude it's it's
very subtle the next one is a Viva Glam
and this is Viva Glam 5 for the Viva
Glam lipsticks all the money goes to
charity which is really good this one I
bought after watching Tania Byers top 10
MAC lipsticks I think and it looked
gorgeous on her
but it doesn't really suit me which is
such a shame I hate when that happens
but it's a kind of a more brownie colour
and the problem I found this is kind of
sparkly which I did not expect I don't
really like that and it's just a bit too
Brown for me I think if I had a bit more
pink in it it would be better for me but
it was a bit too much Brown so it's a
bit too you like grown-up for me I think
but Tanya burr loves this one and it
really suits her it's just a shame
doesn't really suit me the next one is
cut a caper and this one I bought from
the hype definitely all the bloggers are
buying it and it looked gorgeous it is
actually really pretty it's like a
really nice coral color and it's really
nice for the summer it's just a little
bit too bright for me when I wear colors
that are a bit too bright and poppy it
just because I've got such dark features
I don't know I just think it doesn't
look great on me if I put this on really
lightly then it's quite nice then I have
syrup which is my all-time favorite out
of all these lipsticks
it's my favorite matte lipstick ever
I've nearly finished it and it looks
kind of funny in the bullet it looks a
bit brown but it's kind of a sheer
purpley toned everyday nude kind of
lipstick it's bright a bit similar to
plum full but a lot easier to wear and
just a nice daytime lipstick I wear this
all the time I absolutely love it and I
don't know it just really works with my
skin tone and hair color and stuff the
next one is plum full which is another
kind of new one and I really like this
as well really pretty plum color I
talked about this in my favorites video
in December I think and really nice kind
of winter autumn winter color and I
really like the plumy tones so then on
to amplified and I have three from these
amplified is basically just a really
pigmented strong color but they're still
quite moisturizing and easy to wear but
the color payoff is really good so if
you want like a sheer lipstick then
don't go for amplified but the first one
is brick Cola and brittle ah that sounds
weird when I say it but this is a new
one that I just bought with my back to
Mac back to Mac is a program that Mac
have where you can take back six empty
put up six empty Mac products and you
get a free lipstick so I had six empty
eyeshadow pots and I think the Mac and I
got this which is really good and this
one I got two because Estee from SD bus
and spoke about it and she also likes
planful so I thought I might like this
as well and this is the one I'm wearing
today and I do really like it it's kind
of like as the name suggests like a
brick he ready Brown and I actually use
the brush to apply this because I find
with dark lipsticks it's easier to use a
brush and I just really work it into the
lips and then it lasts all day otherwise
it kind of smears a bit but I really
like this actually it's definitely for
like the wintery months but I'm a fan so
far the next one is watch me simmer
another one I bought because of the hype
around it and this is like a really
bright orange coral and it just doesn't
suit me at all I mean I wish I could
wear these colors but I'm not sure I
keep them because sometimes
I wear them and I always like to kind of
try them again because you know my likes
always changed and I might end up really
liking this so I always keep trying it
but at the moment not massive fan
I'll see you when summer comes around
I'll try it again and then st. Germain
which is just the most awful color for
me I'm sure a lot of people love it but
it's like a proper baby Barbie pink and
it just doesn't suit me at all I've got
photos of me wearing this at uni and it
just looks all for these the contrast
between kind of my dark eyebrows dark
hair and then like a bright pink
lipstick it just literally looks awful
on me but if you like baby Pink's then
this is a pretty intense one
so that's st. Germain and I know a lot
people do like that one then I have
another Viva Glam
and this is in a satin of finish and
this is Viva Glam Niki I bought this for
the hike and again there's another
bright that doesn't suit me and then I
don't wear it's a very very pink it's
kind of like I don't know st. Germain's
more of a baby pink this is like a
brighter pink it's an amazing lipstick
and I love owning it but it doesn't
really suit me and then I have angel
which is a frost finish and I really
like this actually for if I want to have
more like baby pink then this is the
kind of baby thing that suits me rather
than the bright kind of neon baby pink
this is more like a softer a rose pink
and I really like angel actually
sometimes it's a bit too bright for me
it kind of depends on my skin tone
throughout the year but if I want a
bigger pink then this is a really nice
one and then I just have two more and
these are matte finishes and the matte
lipsticks from Mac are really good and
really intense I definitely recommend
using a brush to apply them but they
last really well and it's also good to
use a lip liner as well so they don't
kind of bleed off the edge of the lips
and the first one it's chilly out which
I bought last autumn and this is kind of
a dark red with an orange e tone to it
it's pretty like bright a lot but Matt
and I really like this actually and I
think this really suits kind of my skin
tone have a warner it's quite for me
wearing a matte lipstick it's quite an
effort and it's quite a bold statement
so don't wear them that often
when I do I really like both of these
the next one's Russian red which is one
of them acts kind of plastic red
lipsticks and it's a really nice deep
red it's not too bright I can't really
wear bright bright red lipsticks and
kind of I don't feel comfortable wearing
them but because this is a bit darker
it's a bit more kind of grown-up and
really pretty and I think this is the
one that I wore on Christmas Day
actually and everyone complimented me on
it so I really like that one and those
are all my MAC lipsticks so I hope it
was helpful kind of seeing the ones I
have seen swatches I hope this what just
came out all right please let me know
