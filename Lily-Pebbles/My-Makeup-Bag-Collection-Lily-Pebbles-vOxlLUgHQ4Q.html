obsessed with wine makeup bags and
cosmetic bags and travel bags I have so
many I was doing a bit of a clear-out in
my room this weekend and I just found so
many is ridiculous so I thought I would
do a collection video because I just
don't know why I love by a makeup bag
for something to do with oil makeup
being organized in one place I swear I
don't even use them oneis than when I
travel because I don't stay at people's
houses like I used to do when I was
younger I have like a drawer of makeup
so it's a bit ridiculous that I have
this many but I really really love them
and when I see one I like I just can't
help but buy it so I'm gonna show you
all the makeup bags that I have most of
them are just kind of standard makeup
bags some are a bit bigger for traveling
so let me start with the most basic ones
the first one I've got here next to me
is from Charlotte Tilbury and this is
the one from when her makeup line
launched but since then I think she's
got a kind of leathery type one one
that's been more durable on the front
it's got famous people's lips I don't
think she's ever said whose they are but
I'm pretty sure it's like Kate Moss and
Cara Delevingne in there and on the back
it says give a woman the right makeup
she can conquer the world with her
little rose gold star it's just a canvas
makeup bag so it's very floppy which is
a bit annoying because when it's open it
can kind of fall all over the place but
what I like about this one is it opens
really wide because the zip goes down
quite far and doesn't stop there it
really opens up wide so you can really
kind of see what's inside and you're not
restricted but it is very floppy okay
next one is from whistles and I remember
buying this and I just saw it and
completely fell in love on the back it's
just black faux leather and it has a
gold zip and then on the front it's this
really amazing bright coral shade and
the front is like a textured kind of
cotton as well just says whistles up
here and I just really like the shape of
this again it's quite spacious but it is
a bit more restricted because there's it
but it has a vase so you can sit it I
like makeup guys that can sit by
themselves and it's a it's a good size
for like an everyday makeup bag as well
I just I just love the color I think I
bought this for Rich's sister's birthday
as well it's a lovely makeup bag the
next one is from alphabet bags they do
loads of the things I think they do tote
bags key rings maybe or different kinds
of stuff with your
on it so this one has L on the front and
it's a plastic kind of washable material
so it will be wipeable and it's a
similar sort of shape it has a base so
it can stand up and it's rounded at the
top it doesn't sit there's also a little
zip inside which should be good for
keeping like little cotton buds I don't
really use this one that much it does
feel a little bit cheaper but I like
that it's got an L on the front and I
think these make really good gifts as
well I think people just love getting
things with their initials on it I think
this one's also from alphabet bags this
was a gift and it's a canvas flat bag so
it haven't got a base or anything it
just looks like a kind of envelope style
clutch bag it's quite large though it
says you look lovely today which is
really nice I like when they have a
little kind of fonts and sayings on them
this one also has a zip which is a bit
more tough to open and it opens like
this so yeah it says this is made from
100% cotton so it's quite floppy but
also because the zip doesn't open all
the way down the side it let the
Charlotte Tilbury worn you can kind of
stuff it and things weren't fall out
that's just like a really basic one you
can use up all different kinds of things
really you could pobably use that as a
bag if you wanted to but I liked it on
the front I also have this from whistles
which originally I bought it as a clutch
bag but now that I have the slightly
larger clutch bag this to me looks more
like a makeup bag size so it's just a
kind of I think it's faux leather yeah
black on the front and it says whistles
in gold and then on the back it's mink
blue they do these every season and they
always bring out different colors and I
obviously had to buy the mint blue one
because it's my favorite color and it's
got a really nice gold zip so I did use
this as a clutch bag but it is quite
small as you can see so it can look a
little bit weird but it can also be
quite nice because you can just hold it
like this it just feels really nice
quality and they do these on ASOS so if
you ever get a nice discount code you
can buy whistles on ASOS okay so now
onto the more interesting at makeup bags
this one was a gift as well in his from
Tom Ford and it's in that really lovely
like textured leather I love this kind
of leather because it won't scratch or
anything like that and I use this in my
handbag to keep all my lip balms and
lipsticks for the day and I just have so
many Beauty boots hanging around in my
handbag so this is like a two-part it's
very small as you can see and it's got a
bit of a base as well and if you look at
the top there's two zip sections and
then there's a middle section as well
and it also pops together on the side
with little kind of poppers
so it has the tea
for tomforde in the front and then
there's quite a lot of space in the
middle but I found you can't really
stuff that full because if you want to
put stuff in the zip sections it won't
really close so you can put some kind of
more flatter things on the side and then
things like hand sanitizers are a bit
bigger in the middle and it's a really
nice little size it's probably not quite
big enough for everyday makeup bag but
if you don't wear much makeup or like I
said just like a bag within a handbag I
think that's a really cute little size
and I use this one a lot last year or
maybe the year before Anna and I went to
bicester Village which is like an outlet
village I think isn't it Oxford actually
and they have a Lulu Guinness store and
she had some makeup bags and I loved her
makeup bags first of all I got the
Travel cosmetics bag so this is like a
what's the word I'm thinking of I don't
know what the word is for these but
they're like slightly bigger and it has
nothing special about this is there's
nothing kind of inside to organize it
but it's a wipeable material which is
really good so won't get ruined and it's
got the most adorable print on it it's
pink with red and white lips and I
absolutely love this print so much that
I got this one and I also bought the
makeup bag version now this is really
interesting for a makeup bag it looks
like this again the same sort of
wipeable material with the lip print and
then it has this little popper that pops
open and then inside is two sections
that have clay material so you can see
inside so you can open up the zips and
you can put some stuff in there and then
you can also put some stuff on the other
side and I like this because you can
just open it up like this so that it
doesn't open properly which is a little
bit annoying and you can see I've made
it really crappy that's the only problem
with clear material it does get a bit
grubby it's quite hard to clean but you
can kind of see everything you have
inside I'll put all my base makeup on
one side and all my eye makeup on the
other and you can really see where
everything is and I've used this one a
lot for traveling I took this to New
York with me and it's really handy and
then when everything's in it it kind of
sits really nicely as well you can see
in there but it holds together at the
top okay this was from a trish mcevoy
and again it was a gift so it has my
initials on it which is so so nice you
can get your initials put onto her
makeup bags or whatever you want to put
be put on it this one was part of the
coat 2zu i don't have to pronounce that
range so she has just plain black ones
but this one comes in this amazing
kind of a cobalt blue and it's a quilted
kind of leather feeling but it's not
thick it does feel like it probably
could get scratched although mine isn't
scratched so this is the small one she
does a big one as well I think and it
opens with a sit all the way around and
inside mine is pink which is such a nice
kind of contrasting color I'm not really
a pink person but I think these look so
nice together so these are her makeup
planners so they come with a little
insert here that you can put the makeup
in it's magnetic I'm not really into
that kind of thing I mean you can like
mix other makeup and I did for a while
put my Mac
eyeshadows in there and I decanted a
Revlon bronzer and put it in there but
it got a bit fluffy and I prefer to just
use this as a makeup bag so I kind of
wish it wasn't like a Filofax and I wish
it didn't have this bit in the middle
this side has a plastic on the back so
you could put brushes and it won't make
it dirty and it has two pockets here
these the front one is divided into
three and the back one is just open and
then on this side it has this which is
removable so this is just a little mesh
pocket you can put concealers or
whatever you want in there and there's a
bit of space there as well so you can
really pack this full it is still quite
small but I've managed to fit a whole
face of makeup in there and take it
traveling before I did a little video on
my Instagram like a year ago of
everything that I packed in here and you
can fit a lot in but it's quite short so
you couldn't put like three size brushes
in there but these are very cute as
little makeup planners this next one is
from Laura Mercier two things I don't
like about this it's brown and it's hard
I don't really like hard makeup bags
just like I don't really like hard
suitcases I just like to have to squish
things in and I feel like it's quite
restricting when it's hard and brown
just not my favorite color but I'll show
you the inside of this this is kind of
like a makeup planner as well so it
looks like this inside and this moves in
the middle so on one side you have a
mesh makeup bag and it's actually
magnetic which is really clever looks
like this you can put stuff in there and
it just kind of goes back in with a
magnet and then this middle part you can
put brushes or eyeliners or eye shadow
crayons and then there's another magnet
by on this side as well there's a lot of
space in there and you can kind of do
whatever you want with it it's not
restricting I can the inside of this one
is really good it's just very bulky
to pack into your suitcase but then the
hardcase does also protect your makeup
as well and it will stop it from
smashing so it just depends what you
want from your makeup bag I'm completely
obsessed with that Anaheim wash makeup
bags and she does everything she does
some cream bags baby bags cosmetics bags
like Leslie to your back for everything
but they're very expensive and I don't
think I'd really invest in one I just I
don't know why like I've had Selfridges
vouchers before and I could have put it
towards that but it just feels too
expensive for what it is but I got this
with a number of its gift with purchase
and it's very similar I mean it's
obviously way cheaper different material
but the idea is very similar she has one
which says takeoff and landing and it's
like a 2-way bag you can take on a plane
with you and it's a bit like this so
this is I really like the color actually
it's blue and clear and there's two
sides to it there's a top layer which is
the bigger of the two and you can put
whatever you want in there and then it's
also you could flip it over and there's
another bottom section mrs. which is
it's smaller so on the Anaheim wash ones
it says takeoff and landing which is
really cute but you want actually use a
bag like this for airport security so
you'll have to like D count your
products and move them between like a
clear plastic bag and this but the idea
is really good and I've used this before
for traveling just from my makeup or for
some creams or anything like that I
really like that you can see in what's
inside I just love the whole like clear
thing again it's really messy but it
just works and makes it so much easier
so this was like the best this is what
the products actually came in I think it
was a cult beauty order so I don't know
if they're still doing this maybe they
are but I will link it below if they are
because the makeup bag itself was
completely worth it and the products are
great too this is what I picked up from
America when I was there actually no my
friend Keisha I asked her to send this
to me because you can't get Sonia Kashuk
here and she was living in New York at
the time Sonia Kashuk does amazing
makeup bags as well as makeup and this
is one of her like travel cosmetic bags
it's got a really nice print on it it's
like blue red and white it's quite fussy
but I think it kind of works so this has
a little top handle and then it's got
three sections the top layer is for
brushes and look how bobby there is this
disgusting that's got brushes and then
it's got a zip here to put stuff in the
second layer I would say is for makeup
so it's kind of it's not that deep it's
got about that much depth to it
and it's just empty and then the bottom
section you can put skin hair or your
toothbrush which clearly I have done and
I've made such a mess in there but it's
slightly more deep than the layer above
and I just think that's really good it
is a little bit floppy you like it kind
of because there's no back to it it does
kind of fall around which is a little
bit annoying but this is the best one
that I've found for traveling and this
is the one I use when I do go away and I
can kind of fit everything in there
skincare makeup brushes sometimes I have
to take a separate thing if I'm taking
some creams and body products but most
of my stuff can fit in this which is
great okay finally my biggest one and
the one I have very mixed feelings about
this is from Percy and read Percy meets
a hairdresser so this is very much aimed
our hair but you can also use it for any
beauty products really so it's got
handle like this it looks a bit like a
suitcase a briefcase sorry and it's got
a zip it goes all the way around and
when you open it it looks like this so
it has a zip on the inside it has a
clear pouch which is attached and then
it has two beauty bags here which can
also pop out on them there are a lot of
sections and it's a lot of storage space
but I do find that this can get quite
bulky if you were actually to fill both
of these bags and everything inside and
then close it it's like a huge bag to
pack into your suitcase so I don't use
this that often but when I got it I was
happy with it but it's a bit kind of
floppy and I don't mean I'm not 100%
happy with it but I kind of keep it in
case and I suppose it's good to store
hair things at home which is actually
what it's meant for so those are all my
makeup bags I told you I have a lot it
is a serious obsession of mine so if you
have any recommendations for great
makeup bags let me know and maybe you
found a recommendation through watching
this oh I forgot to say if you liked
this makeup let me know because I'm
thinking about doing my next monthly
makeup tutorial with this look which is
like a blue eyeliner if you can see so
let me know what you think thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you on
Tuesday for my next weekly vlog bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
