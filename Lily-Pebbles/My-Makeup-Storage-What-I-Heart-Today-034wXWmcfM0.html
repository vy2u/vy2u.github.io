of my makeup and beauty storage I did a
room tour awhile ago but I've changed a
lot of things recently I'm sort of
reorganised how I store my makeup so I
thought I'd show you this is my dressing
table that I got from Ikea awhile ago
when I redid my bedroom and this is
where I keep my daily essentials I keep
my perfumes up here on the right we have
Rich's perfume here which is the
Abercrombie fierce
this is Dipsy Philosopher's another dip
seek perfume Estee Lauder perfume a dip
tea candle and the quarterly beauty
elixir in the middle I keep all my
brushes I have this clear holder for
Muji and so I keep all my brushes and
then in this empty tip tea candle I keep
my face brushes these ones I use every
day also foundation powder bronzer blush
concealer and on the Left I just keep
some of my candles so inside this top
drawers where I just keep my daily
essentials I have all my hair clips and
hair bands here and my work makeup bag I
have a couple of origins body creams and
some perfumes and riches moisturizer
that I did really want to keep up and
display and I've got a quarterly makeup
remover these are my daily essentials
mascara concealer an eyeshadow i primer
black eyeliner my NARS bronzer and
powder and a blusher this is my origins
theorem benefit primer lush toner and a
folder the serum and these and here's my
origins moisturizer
I am Bunny's moisturizer original Oyster
eyes with SPF and my Laura Mercier
primer I also keep Gemma key foundation
origins are eye cream and my tweezers
and then in the back cotton wool pads
and cotton wool sticks that's not what
that hood I can't remember these are
called q-tips that's the American word
whatever these are called are kids in
there
Everage has a little draw here for his
do German I creams and manly things this
is where I keep the nail polishes that I
want to use so I have a big makeup case
and I keep all my nail polishes these
are the ones I want to try and use so
I've got all my SC polishes there I've
got some bourgeois opf Sephora there's
an inner mask or one there more SC
Topshop that's an arse so a new bar is
like sort of like a base coats and top
coats I'm just a few random ones there
so this is sort of the polishes that I
like the best
and this wall mount I actually got from
a store that supply to beauty shops it's
sort of in Northland and I try and find
the name but I think any sort of
retailer shop like that would do them it
was quite expensive it was like 30 40
quid or something and then for the most
exciting bear I just went to Ikea a few
weeks ago and bought a couple of helmet
units so they look like this I basically
put one on top of another one so that's
why one finishes and then I put another
one there I got this from a lip gloss to
be in blog post and also spoke to Jen
from beauty junkie London they both
highly recommended these so I went to
get some form IKEA so I've labeled them
as you can see lip splash eyes mascara
eyeliner foundation moisturizers
palettes that's expensive palettes high
street palettes and then they're sort of
random floors there so I'll talk you
through them quickly I also bought some
inserts from Ikea I think these are
called Antonia I'll find out the name
and link them below but these off you
have to squeeze them in but once you do
they fit nicely so here I've got lip
balms at the back lip roses here sort of
lipsticks and random lipsticks lip
butters lip balms those kind of things
and MAC lipsticks they're in my second
drawer I've got blushes
so cream blushes and bronzers and
highlighters this draw I've got eyes
shadows Y shadows sort of cream
eyeshadows mister like silk parts and
the maybelline cream eyeshadows and
eyeliners there and this drive got
expensive mascara is high street
mascaras and sort of the eye lasers I
really like sometimes the drawers can be
quite stiff to open this one because for
the foundation is quite hard to open in
here I've got some foundations and
tinted moisturizers here and in here
I've got it moisturizers yep
moisturizers and eye creams in this
drawer I've got sort of expensive
palettes at my Mac palette naked and
Estee Lauder palettes and in this drawer
I've got my sort of more high streets
palettes MUA Pixley Gemma kids and here
is a random draw for those tools eyelash
curlers lip tattoos one another random
drawer full of things I didn't want to
put them now
now now far and I believe a man crazy
and in here sort of the rest of my nail
polish's a tricep neatly but it's very
gonna work and also I forgot to say that
I'm trying to find a way to store my MAC
lipsticks so I can actually see what
they are cuz obviously all the names
I'll run the bottom so if anyone has any
ideas please let me know because I've
been trying everything and so far
nothing's worked so that is my Helmer
makeup storage unit and I love it took
ages to sort out but I'm really happy
with it
so I hope you like to see my makeup
storage let me know what you think and
I'll put all the links below for work
whatever you think in case you want to
get something I've had a lot of question
about the helmet units so yeah thanks
for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
