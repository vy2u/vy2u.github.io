all really well today's video is going
to be my most worn style items and I saw
Sami do this video a while ago and I
absolutely loved it I text her straight
away saying do you mind if I do this
video too and she said of course not so
I will link
Sammis video below and today I'm gonna
do my version for you guys before I
start I've been getting an overwhelming
amount of tweets and comments from you
guys saying that my videos aren't
showing in your subscription boxes I've
contacted YouTube and they said that
it's a problem a lot of people are
having and they're not sure why so all I
can suggest for now so that you don't
miss any of my future videos is to turn
on notifications for my videos I have
that for a few channels that I really
love so it just pops up on my phone all
you have to do is go to youtube.com
forward slash Lily pebbles click the
little settings wheel and turn on
notifications for uploads
I only upload two videos a week so it
shouldn't be that annoying but then at
least you won't miss any of my videos so
I'm gonna get started on this video I'm
basically talking through the style
items that I find myself wearing all the
time some of them have been the same for
5 years some of them are a bit more kind
of at the moment I wasn't sure exactly
how to do this video but I feel like if
you watch my vlogs you'll already know
what all the items are anyway so let's
start with jeans my absolute favorite
jeans are the Topshop Jaime jeans I have
looked for expensive jeans and in the
skinny style I haven't found anything
that fits as well as Topshop Jaime jeans
they don't last that well I'd say they
last maybe four or five months before
the black ones start to fade and the
blue ones kind of lose their shape a bit
but I absolutely love them I have them
in black I have them in denim with rips
on the knees and I have them in denim
with no rips on the knees
and what I love about the Jaime jeans is
they're really high waisted so they suck
you in if your tummy is the area that
you don't love and they're really skinny
all the way down to the ankle I have
quite skinny ankles so it's hard to find
genes that are actually skinny around my
ankles and I like to roll these up they
fit really nicely around the balm area
the pockets all in the right kind of
flattering places and I always buy these
in a size slightly too small so I'd say
I maybe like a 29 if a 29 existed in
high-waisted but I always buy these in a
28 so for the first two three
weeks I'm kind of suffocating in my own
jeans but then they stretch so it's
always really important I think to get
the size down because once they stretch
in the past I've got like a 30 and
they've just got too saggy so I always
go a size down and then they fit
perfectly after like two to three weeks
the next style item I'm going to talk
about is a simple sweater I tweeted a
while ago the whole like sweater jumper
thing I don't know if it's an American
UK thing in my mind a jumper is
something a bit more heavier a sweater
something a bit lighter and I love a
simple sweater the weather's not great
in the UK so for me I don't find much
put invest in a nice kind of tops
because I always end up having to lay on
top anyway so a nice sweater works
perfectly with jeans I actually really
liked M&amp;amp;S Marks and Spencer for sweaters
this one I bought last year and it's
cashmere and you guys would have seen me
wore this loads it's black grey and blue
it's slightly boxy shape but it's so
soft comfortable to wear I really love
the pop of blue and is such a nice
sweater another one I got from Marks and
Spencers recently is slightly thinner
but I think it's also got a bit of
cashmere in it's from the M&amp;amp;S collection
it's kind of beige gray and again blue
it's got stripes on it I love stripes so
easy to wear such a good kind of
layering piece and then the final one
you definitely would have seen recently
because I'm obsessed with it it's from
cause I tried this on in the black and
the navy blue and then just the size I
tried on the pink but ended up really
loving the pink it's like a really kind
of rosy slightly gray toned pink it's
quite a thick sweater but then it has
this kind of faux silk shirt peeking out
the bottom so it makes it look like
you've put more effort into your outfit
you've laid a shirt under a jumper but
you actually haven't
I mean sweater looks like you'd let it a
shirt under your sweater but you haven't
it's all joined so easy to wear look so
nice of denim jeans and like converse or
a really casual outfit and I absolutely
love this I love wearing t-shirts I find
them so comfortable to wear and when I'm
wearing jeans and I just need to throw
something on I know me throw on a
t-shirt and sometimes layer a sweater on
top when I'm at home I'm definitely
always wearing a t-shirt I recently
picked up this white one from whistles
I've been looking for the perfect white
tee and although it's slightly too wide
around the neck it's pretty close to the
perfect white tee it's a really nice
thin soft
material it's got a really flattering
line down the back and I just love
having a white t-shirt in my wardrobe
they're nice to tuck into jeans just a
really good layering piece or if you
have like a fancy bomber jacket to go on
top it's just one of those things I
think is really important to have in
your wardrobe I've also been loving
excuse how dirty this is but I've been
loving my ID dusty shirts I have one in
black with the white logo and white with
the black logo and again really good for
in under jackets good to wear with jeans
I just find t-shirts so comfortable and
easy I love an oversized gray t-shirt as
well that you can roll up the sleeves
perfect for spring/summer okay let's
talk about scarfs something that I think
is really important when you live in the
UK because you never quite know what the
weather's like it can look sunny but
then it's actually quite cold it could
suddenly start raining out of nowhere so
I like to use a scarf that doubles up as
an accessory as a blanket when you're
cold as a rain protector when you don't
have an umbrella and these are probably
my two favorite scoffs you've probably
seen a lot of this one is bluey gray mix
scarf that's from a brand would Lily and
Lionel such a nice brand I love the
people there and this scarf is it's kind
of medium sized it doesn't wrap around
twice but it's quite big but it's not
overwhelming big it's so nice that
wearing all the time and then this blue
one from Topshop that I got I think last
year maybe even two years ago I love the
blue this is like one of my favorite
colors to wear it's cool like a checked
pattern and this is huge so it wraps
around like twice and this one's great
for when I'm traveling and I can use it
as like a pillow as well it's just so
comfortable and you do have to were
quite a neutral outfit with it because
it's so blue but I really like it
okay I'm going to quickly talk about
bags but I'm not gonna touch on this too
much because I'm gonna film a handbag
collection video of all of my bags and
really talk through each one but I think
my most worn handbag style are the
strata-ray of Scotland bags I've got a
medium size navy blue one and then a
small black one and I use this one when
I want a small bag in this one when I
need to carry it a bit more stuff I will
talk about these properly in my handbag
collection video but these are
definitely my most worn I will link
below to the website
such nice bags okay let's talk about
bombers which I probably should have put
a leather jacket in this part though I
don't have a proper leather jacket I've
gone from
so some years ago that I still loved but
I wouldn't say it's like the best
leather jacket ever but at the moment
and definitely for the past couple of
months I've been loving wearing bombers
they work so well there's just something
to throw on top this still looks cool
but kind of keeps you warm as well I
have a black one from Topshop and I kind
of wish I'd waited and got the one from
Zara that has gold zips but I don't mind
this one's slightly oversized such a 90s
throwback but I'm really enjoying
wearing this I think it just gives your
outfit something a little bit kind of
cool and edgy but then it's really still
practical as well so I really like the
black bomber from Topshop and then I
also have this off from Zara which I've
just been wearing to death if you go to
my Instagram it's literally all you will
see in every photo
it's so nice though I actually bought it
before a shoot because they said I
needed to wear color it's not that
colourful but I'm really glad I picked
it up I think I've got it in Edinburgh
it's kind of a white beige bomber and
it's got this floral quite colorful
print all over and it's the perfect
spring kind of transitional jacket
really like that and the other coat that
I wear a lot is my whistles coat I love
a long oversized coat I know that a lot
of people will hate the style but I
really really love it definitely
inspired by my friend SJ who likes to
wear men's clothes she wears oversized
clothes a lot and it looks so so cool I
saw this in the whistles sale it was
like 40% off I'm so happy I found it
gray light gray and dark gray as you
love gray and it's got a hood so it
starts spitting the rain but not enough
to put an umbrella up it's perfect I
just love the kind of straight style of
it it's bright on my street my favorite
coat by far okay let's talk about shoes
my two most worn style of shoes are
boots and these are my Steve Madden
boots I have them in black and I have
them in brown everybody wear brown
anywhere else but I really like the kind
of brown of these shoes they're a simple
kind of Chelsea boot style with gold
detail and slightly rounded toe I can't
really wear pointed toe but if it's too
rounded looks bold fashion this is
somewhere in the middle so easy to just
slip on you'd have to do them up I wear
these all the time they're maybe not
that appropriate for the evening depends
where you're going I can wear them to
like a gig or to papasan me but probably
not for like a smart evening they are so
comfortable I don't wear uncomfortable
like as a rule which is why I'm not that
into buying shoes because I'm always so
disappointed if they feel comfortable in
the store and then I wear them and
they're not comfortable I just can't
continue wearing them
so I'm not really a shoe person I just
wear these over and over again they
still sell them and no joke I'm thinking
of buying a new pair I also love a good
trainer I just love being casual I think
it suits me and I like being comfortable
and my two favorite trainers are my
white converse I used to think that
converses was so uncomfortable and I
realized it's because I had a size six
and I'm a six and a half most shoe
brands don't do half sizes but converse
actually do so now I have a six and a
half these are the comfiest things ever
I don't like wearing them for going
through like long walks or wearing them
all day because I have flat feet and
these are really flat so it does end up
hurting my back but if I'm not wearing
them for that long they're so
comfortable and I think they look so
cool
I used to tuck the laces in when I was
younger but I think it looks so much
cooler if you have your laces tied up
and if they get dirty it doesn't matter
it all adds to the like converse
coolness I also have these which are
from adidas they're the Stan Smith's and
they're just plain black the only white
but they have is on the back everything
else is black they're velcro which is
amazing completely changed in my life
makes putting on your shoes so much
quicker and way more fun I wear these a
lot as well so that's actually
everything for my most worn items if
you're wondering what I'm wearing on my
lips it's a mix of Steeler bocce and Kat
Von D or I got my what it's called
something bone it's like the really
really nude one so I've just mix those
together if you haven't seen my last
video I will link it here don't forget
to go and have a watch you may have
missed it because YouTube has being so
annoying and if you would like to
