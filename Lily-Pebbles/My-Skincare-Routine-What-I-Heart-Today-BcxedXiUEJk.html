my skincare routine and it shouldn't be
a very long video there's not that much
to it but I thought I'll show you my
favourite products and so of what I've
been using recently so in the evening I
take my eye makeup off first
I did this with Bioderma this has been
spoken about loads so I won't go as much
detail I've been using it for a couple
years now whenever I go to France or
anyone I know this France I make them
stock up big time so I've never had to
buy on eBay I know it's really
overpriced on tea bakers in the French
pharmacy stores it's about 8 euros or
something like that so anyway it's
basically like water as you can see and
it's amazing it takes our makeup off in
that seconds and it feels really gentle
I love it and I'm never ever gonna use
anything else to take my eye makeup off
I know it so I'm really happy i uses
every evening with cotton wool pads to
take my eye makeup off then I go into
the bathroom and I cleanse my face I've
tried a few different cleansers over the
past few years and the Liz Earle cleanse
and polish is by far being my favorite
because it really cleanses your skin but
takes your makeup off really well as as
well because I sometimes fun with
cleansers that they make your skin feel
soft but you'll always have to take off
your makeup afterwards again but this
takes absolutely everything off this is
the big size I had the pump but I've
kept running out so quickly so I just
thought I'd invest in the big one so
this is really creamy you put some into
your hands sort of oh no like i dampen
my face sometimes just cuz it feels
weird go straight on a dry face so I
don't put my face but some of this in my
hand like maybe that much and it's
really creamy just rub it around your
whole face you can put in your eyes and
it won't sting which is really good and
and then you get a muslin cloth which
looks like this and Liz I'll do sell
them but you can also get them from like
John Lewis baby section you know babies
use these they're really cheap you can
get them in bulk and run this under warm
water and then just take off your face
gently my mom's been using muslin cloth
absolutely yes since I was little and
remember she used to always tell me to
cleanse and use a cloth and I used to
always use face wipes but then when I
found this I started using these and now
I'll never go back so yeah this is
really good it's really reasonable I
think there's about 13 pounds you can
get it from John Lewis and there's I'll
have loads of other great products so I
don't really like them so after I taking
my make eye makeup off I've cleansed my
face I then moisturize so my kind of
all-time favorite moisturizer is Embree
release which is another French pharmacy
brand this is the first one I've got but
I think I've got it a few months ago and
there's still loads left it's gonna last
me for ages I also I wanted to get this
for me when she was in France and she
asked in the shop but I think the lady
looked at her like she was mad so I
think it's quite like an old product
people in France don't really get the
height but here there's a massive hyper
on this product it's just basically
playing on fragrance moisturizer it's
not too runny and it's not too thick
it's like middle which I really like and
it's a nice squeezy tube so I'll use
this morning and night
but recently I've also been trying a
different moisturizer at night a
slightly thicker one because when you're
eights bed and it doesn't matter you're
not putting under makeup so I'd always
try and use a thicker moisturizer at
night and because then this one doesn't
have SPF in it's also a good one for the
night this is the orange origins a
perfect world moisturizer and I really
like this it's got a bit of a funny
smell and describe it so I was really
like natural like I was like a natural
product that like soil look in a nice
way and this is really nice it's a bit
thicker so I layer this on for you it's
a bit it's really moisturize my skin
while I'm asleep and this is really nice
actually and this is the one on April
21st they're doing a trading day at all
origins counters and you can take in any
old packaging empty packaging and get
one of these in exchange and it's a
whole like recycling thinks that's
really good so I would
when this you should go on April 21st
I'm definitely going to yeah in the
morning I always use embryo lease it's
really good to put under makeup I just
really really like it I'm definitely
gonna get more next time I go to France
I also use eye cream i've been using the
origins ginseng and i really like this
but I've realized that it's not um
anti-aging or anything like that so I'm
not sure if there's any point in it
using it because I thought the whole
point was that it is I don't know I'm
confused but oh yeah this refreshing eye
cream to Brighton and deep Hough so this
is good I really like this in the
morning sometimes randomly I'll wake up
and have really puffy eyes and I don't
know why but I put this on and it really
helps it so it's of like a so many pink
color and it's really creamy and you
just put a bit on your full finger
because it's the lightest finger and
sort of pull it about around your eye
bone and sometimes up sometimes I see
people putting eye cream like way off
their eye it's really bad you definitely
shouldn't do that apparently put it
there and that's the bit where it soaks
into your eye the quickest so dab a bit
of that on I use that morning and night
it's really nice I don't know if it's
helping me I won't tell it might be able
to tell until 40 as time hopefully I
have nice tight eyes when I'm 60 in the
morning or so before I moisturize or
anything so I sort of cleanse my face
I'm all clean in the morning and I've
been using this which is the dr. Andrew
for origins megabites serum and this is
a new product for origins actually as
part of their maker brights range and
it's just a serum meant to brighten up
your skin now I can't really tell if
this makes a massive difference when
really birth is always given but it's
just a really nice consistency and
texture and I really like putting on
before my moisturizer and before my
primer it's just a really nice base so
I've just been using this everyday and
I'm really enjoying actually so I'm just
gonna keep using it it's not sinful
around the eyes it's just so for the
middle parts of your face and I love the
packaging as well
cute so yeah I really like that I've
been using that first thing in the
morning for exfoliating I haven't really
got like one product that I swear by so
I just sort of grabbed whatever's in
here and the two ones I normally use and
the ark age repair skin refining
exfoliator I really like art products
actually and this exfoliator is really
nice it's really gentle it's not too
harsh I don't really like exfoliator is
that too exfoliating is I think my skin
feels quite sensitive and I just don't
like using anything it's too harsh so
this is really nice and gentle and I
always go back to this while then it's
just works whatever else for younger
skin as well as mess may be wife's
before gentle and that's really nice I
also used the Dermalogica thermopolium
this is a little sample one that came in
the glossy box I really like this it's
weird it's literally as soon as you put
on your face it heats up and you can
feel the heat again I like to dampen my
face a bit with this one because it's
quite dry and I don't feel like I'm
dragging my skin but this one is amazing
like after you use it and wash it off
your skin feels so soft so when I finish
this I might buy the full size actually
I'm gonna find out how much is but that
is really nice that's the Dermalogica
thermofoil ian's and that's it oh
there's one more thing in the morning I
can be a bit lazy I don't like to use
this all the time because it is hard
again I don't want to waste it so I sort
of saved that for I have a full face of
makeup on when I wake up in the morning
sometimes I had a bit bit of mascara
left on you know if you haven't taken
off well the night before so I add in
your space wipes sometimes I don't use
on my face because it does so because I
got tear in your face but I use it
around my eyes sometimes and these are
just the cucumber cleansing wipes from
superjock yes yes you've joked probably
the cucumber ones actually they feel
quite refreshing especially if you use
them in the morning so I like those
that's just sort of emergency but that's
everything so I hope maybe found
something new products do that let me
know what you use your skincare routine
also I'm trying to get into this of
YouTube thing so if there's any videos
you want me to do
recommend please comment and let me know
because sorts of try think of ideas it's
quite hard but I'm enjoying this I think
so watching I think so everyone who's
subscribed and see you in the next video
