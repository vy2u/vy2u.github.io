couple of things first of all my tattoos
I get quite a few questions and I have
done kind of since I started my blog a
few years ago about tattoos I have and
where I got them done and all this stuff
and I've never really spoken about it
before I think because it's quite a
personal thing and I didn't want people
leaving horrible comments saying they
didn't like them or whatever because I
got them for me
and they weren't for anyone else so um
in the nicest way possible I don't
really care if no one else likes them my
family and friends hate tattoos so I
definitely didn't get it for anyone else
so if you don't like them please don't
tell me just it's not necessary things
anywhere I thought I'd taught you
through I've got four tattoos so my
first tattoo is one that's on my lower
back it's kind of like on the back of my
hip it's not in the center it's just on
the right hand side I used to wear my
jeans and Charles is really low so you
used to see all the time now I wear high
waisted chances I never see it but it is
a treble clef which is like the music
thing for those of you that don't know I
got that done when I was 16 I think it
was either 16 or 17 um which i think is
under the age that you're supposed to be
to get tattoos I don't really know how I
did that um but I did and I got it done
in Camden at a place called Camden locks
I think it cost me about 30 pounds which
is too cheap you should never pay that
for a tattoo there's normally like a
minimum buy or 50 or sometimes like 80
pounds so and it was my first tattoo and
it definitely didn't hurt as much as I
thought it would I mean I did get in
kind of quite like a choppy part of my
body but it was alright I think I
remember I had to like break halfway
through to sort of stick my head out the
window I fell bit sick but it definitely
didn't have as much as peer since I've
had my bellybutton pierced in the past I
don't have it anymore and I've had like
my ears pierced and up here um and I
think piercings have more than tattoos
so yeah I remember my first one I was
quite surprised it didn't hurt that much
um but it was quite small tattoo so yeah
I got that one as I said I did
you ever see that one anymore because
kind of quite low down and I don't
really wear clothes that show that area
anymore the second has to I got was when
I was 19 and I was on my gap year such a
cliche I'm on my gap year I went to
Thailand Australia Fiji la for life I
was traveling for three months um and I
got them to draw it in Thailand I think
I got them to draw it in koh pipi I'll
show you now it's on my ankle and it's
Thai writing means flower for Lily
didn't want to get Lily so I got flower
and I got them to draw it in Co PP I got
henna done in Bangkok city if I liked it
I asked absolutely everyone what it
meant to check so if your Thai and
you're watching this and it means Thai
green curry please don't tell me because
it's there now and whatever I'd rather
not know if it doesn't mean flower for
this versus a flower and yes I got it
henna dawn I tried it and I didn't want
to get it done in Thailand just because
you've had a few I've heard a few horror
stories and I don't know I just I hadn't
made my decision yet either I wanted to
wait a while so I got it done on the way
back in LA I'm on Sunset Boulevard I got
it done in a carton of the name of the
place because I went in somewhere that I
think was called something Panther and
they said they couldn't do it because
they weren't sure they didn't know if it
said the wrong thing they would have
been held responsible which is a bit
annoying so I went to a place next door
which wasn't recommended to me it was
just the place next door I was googling
it and there's one with Sunset Strip
tattoo and I recognized the name so it
might have been that place I'm not sure
and I also don't know how much it was
but that one heard a little bit more
because it was on my ankle it's quite
thin skin it's near bone it's quite
sensitive but not unbearable I've never
like cried having a tattoo done I don't
think it's like a crying pain it's just
like a bit stinging a bit annoying it
it's like someone scratching you in the
same place over and over again it's just
really annoying and you're I just want
the pain stop but it's not unbearable at
all so yeah I got that one down in LA
and I got some really good cream
in LA for tattoos it was kind of like a
watery jell-o comment but it's cooler
but it was so good it's really annoying
that they didn't sell it here but yeah
that was probably the best laughter keV
stuff that I've got which was in America
tattoo number three it was this one so
these are three stars i have on my wrist
this is probably the one had the least
thought into it
I was at uni I must have been out 20 21
I think my thing second year uni um yeah
Pauly second year and I was just used to
draw this on my wrist all the time I'm a
real doodler when I'm in lectures or
anything it actually helps you
concentrate I always doodly and I just
remember always drawing those always
drawing stars at my wrist and sometimes
I tell people you know some people
really like what you tell meaning to
your tattoos so I just say oh yeah three
stars like one for me and one for my
sisters but it's not really for that I
kind of just wanted to get it done so
it's three stars and the one in the
middle has like two outlines and there's
two little ones on the side and yeah
drawing on and really liked it and I go
to a timber noon which is where I was at
uni oh no I didn't Ryan no my boyfriend
got his daughter beaudion I came back to
London for the weekend and I went to LA
Hardy's place in Mazal Hill the Hardy's
famous tattoo guy I think it's called
new wave tattoo and I think this arms
about 80 pounds and it's quite small but
like I said no way to have like a cap
number you have to pay like minimum um
so yeah there's like there's a little
bit of smudging on it which is a bit
annoying when I went in the guy who's
doing mine said it was his first day
which was a bit worrying but the place
is really good I'm glad I'm happy with
it I don't regret any of my tattoos by
the way I'm not really that kind of
person like even if I don't love some of
them I'm not the sort of person to
regret things like you only live once so
I'm not really a regret in tight so yeah
what anything else to say about the
stars no I think that's just it this one
didn't have much thought going into it
and then the next one my fourth tattoo
is this one and this one probably had
the most thought going to
I feel like like I'm not gonna promise
anything I feel like this is my last
tattoo because I don't want people to
look at me and see that I've got tattoos
everywhere I think mine are quite hidden
and I feel like I know I'm obviously got
loads of space I feel like I've run out
of space of where I want to put tattoo
and these two I mainly got because
they're for me I want to go to see them
my first few tattoos I can't really see
it's like my ankle my back and I just
realized that the whole points have to
use this for me so I wanted to get some
I could see and enjoy that's why I
really like my wrist ones probably the
best um so yeah this one had the most
thought go in to where I got it done
earlier this year so one I'm 24 and I
got it done in the family business in
Exmouth market in London which is my
favorite sassy place I love it really
cool guys like they literally live
breathe eat sleep touches and you have
to put really far in advance is quite
expensive these are all signs like a
good tattoo place I think minimum may
have been like 100 pounds so I probably
paid like 120 because mine is literally
thin writing so let me show it to you it
says a new kid in town um which is a
song by Eagles and I was born while this
song was playing
well the album was playing and my whole
family big Eagles fans I've sort of
grown up to the music so it means a lot
to me and I kind of like the title new
kid in town and the songs all about like
15 minutes of fame but then it goes away
and someone has constant it's a place
and I quite like the whole meaning of
the song and I love the song and I just
thought it was good so I got that one
done and everyone keeps asking me what
the font is I actually got the guy I
think I had to go with Francisco and he
drew it for me he didn't want cities
they said originally that they don't
really draw fonts because obviously if
they draw something and you just end up
going back and forth changing it and it
gets a bit stressful but I just said I
can't find anything that I like so um he
he was really patient with me and we sat
and drew it and I kind of went over it
and showed like what I wanted and we
just played around with it for a while
and then got to this I said to him the
main things I really wanted it really
really fine writing and like I'll sell
on to the that sighs we I did the little
flick outs on the N on the two ends on
the side so it kind of made it kind of
smooth and flowing um and I got it there
Marshall why about there that's just
kind of where fasted I was going to get
it in the middle but I decided to put it
there though it's a bit like at Elise's
which I really don't like if I never
show people that way Oh show people that
way
and yeah I like I really like this one
and also because it's there I don't
really see it all the time but then when
I catch it I just like remember it's
there and it's really nice I love that
is it's such like a love/hate thing you
either like them or you don't I think
but I think most of my friends and
family my sisters have tested it but
they've got like one or two um my
friends all like hate that is my parrot
type that is though if you want it you
have to really want it don't do it for
anyone else so yeah those are my four
tattoos I think that's all I have to say
about them I probably won't get any more
but you never know I always have to
really think about why long beforehand
and I always draw on as well like with
all my tattoos I drew them on for at
least a month before hands to kind of
get used to it see if I like it but it's
quite tricky sometimes this one I had to
get someone to help with and so yeah
that's what my tattoos and what else
have I got to talk about today oh I'm so
excited on Friday I'm going to Paris my
lovely lovely boyfriend I love him and
is our five-year anniversary and he's
been planning a trip for ages I kind of
forgot about it because he told me early
on that he was going to be surprised so
I kind of just stopped guessing and kind
of forgot that it's coming up this
weekend and he wanted to tell me a few
days in advance because he knows I'm
like super organized freak and I wanted
to like plan what I'm taking he told me
early on and he looked seriously told me
that I wouldn't need a passport so I was
like I was not going to Paris um and
then I was like oh god it's getting
