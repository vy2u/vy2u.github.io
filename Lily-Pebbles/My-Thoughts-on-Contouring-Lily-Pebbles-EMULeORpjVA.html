contouring is something I have quite a
strong opinion on and I feel like I just
wanted to add my video to the collection
that was already up there on YouTube
hello just me interrupting me here just
wanted to apologize for the hissing
sound during this video as you know I
have a new microphone I have now figured
out a way to stop the hissing apologies
because when I type in contouring on
YouTube there's definitely a theme with
sorts of videos that come up and if you
don't know what contouring is it's a
makeup technique to change the shape of
your face it uses shadows and lights to
create depth where they would have just
been a flat canvas before now you've
probably seen those photos where there's
brown and white marks all over the face
they're Kim Kardashian style contouring
I think it's incredible it's a makeup
artist technique and there are some
incredible makeup artists on YouTube
that are doing amazing things it's like
being an artist like being a painter
painting the face and creating different
shapes where there weren't before
changing the shape of your nose I really
do think it's an amazing skill but
because of how YouTube is and it's so
global and open to anyone I worry that
the lines blur and the normal everyday
girls young 15 year olds but also moms
and people just learning how to do their
makeup but even like that's what they
have to do with their makeup and you
really don't I think that sort of
contouring for an everyday person that
isn't on the stage or isn't on TV or
isn't in like musical theater I really
don't think that you need to do it and
if anything I think it makes it look
like you're wearing too much makeup when
you see that sort of contouring and
camera it looks incredible but in real
life you're really wearing layers and
layers of concealer and cream and
powders and it's I personally think it's
a bit too much but I feel like there
aren't that many videos that just show
contouring for an everyday girl not on
for the theater or for cameras of TV so
I wanted to show you guys that the
products I like to use for contouring
and how I do it because I don't ever do
that jewelry thing we put brown and
white all over your face you probably
see me contouring in some of my makeup
videos but I thought I'd do like one
whole video on it just explaining so
contouring is great if you want to
change the shape of your face slightly
if you have a slightly rounder face you
can make it a bit more
chiselled or for me I just like to use
it to add some kind of warmth and
dimension to my face I don't like to
change the shape of my nose I don't like
my nose but I think you'll just kind of
have what you're given it's nice that
makeup that can allow you to change
things if you want it to but personally
I prefer people to just know how I look
so they're not disappointed
when they see me with no makeup on to do
your console you don't actually have to
use a contour product I often just use
bronzer you can use a normal browser
this is my solar powder format so from
glory and this isn't even matte it's
just a normal one so it's got a bit of
shimmer one of the sides is matte ones
shimmer and I can sometimes just like
mix these together with a big fluffy
brush and the way I apply my bronzer is
in a three shape so obviously you can
just apply a bronzer all over but if you
want more of a shape to your face I like
to apply it in a three so from the
temples down to under my cheekbones and
then down to my chin so the contour
lines are basically where bones in your
face you can feel they go in so there's
like under your eye under your cheeks so
if you feel with your brush it's kind of
just there under your cheekbone and that
that's really where I just kind of apply
my bronzer and if you want to practice
contouring with a bronzer but you want
it to look more like a contour then just
try using a matte bronzer this one from
Too Faced is the chocolate bronzer in
the medium/deep shade so slightly darker
it's slightly orange e-1 but find one
that suits your skin tone yeah just use
a matte bronzer you can use any brush
really if you're a little bit nervous
use one that's slightly bigger if you
want something that's a bit more defined
you can use a smaller brush the
Charlotte Tilbury
powder and sculpt it's called that's
really nice because it's like you've
pointed so you can really get it into
your cheekbones this is just a small one
for Mac I'm not sure what number is one
one zero I think or this one is the
contour brush from Real Techniques but I
find this is better for cream at
products powder bronzers powder contours
I think are definitely much easier to
use I tend to just stick with those
although I do have one cream one that I
will talk you through in a minute
using bronzers just to shake your face
or a really nice easy everyday way to
contour that's what I do most days and I
think it looks really natural and really
pretty and it does the job if you do
want a slightly more intense contour
maybe you're going out in the
evening and you want more of like a
contoured look or maybe you make youtube
videos too and it's nice sometimes on
camera to contour because it just looks
better on camera I have three products
that I would recommend they're all a
little bit different the first one is
from Charlotte Tilbury and it's her
film-star bronze &amp;amp; Glow this is probably
my favorite product for contouring its
bronzer and highlighter the bronzer
isn't much it's slightly shimmery so
it's not too intense it's really easy to
use but you can't really see the shimmer
so it's very subtle and the highlight is
just gorgeous I talked about this
product all the time this consort is
somewhere between a bronzer and a
traditional console because usually
consort shades are quite grey which if
you are a makeup artist and you can work
with it very easily then it's great but
if you're just a normal everyday girl I
find the grey contours can make you look
a little bit dead if you overdo it and
it's very hard not to overdo it so it's
much more natural to stick to a bronzy
shade but this was good because it's not
too orange
they're very buttery and creamy and easy
to blend so this is definitely my
favorite choice I apply the bronzer kind
of temples under my cheekbones under my
chin and then the highlighter just on
the tops of my cheekbones and sometimes
down the center of my nose on the other
scale of contour powders is the Kevyn
Aucoin sculpting powder I think it's
called in medium and this is the one I
was talking about it's a very kind of
gray tone contour and a lot of people
like to use this because it is really
good but it has a very stony gray color
to it so as I said I think it can make
you a little bit dead and unless you're
very good at makeup it's quite hard to
get away with this I often see people
use it and just think it just doesn't
look natural on camera it looks great
but in real life it just doesn't look
very natural so I use this one when I'm
filming sometimes occasionally on a
night out but I don't really use it that
often anymore this one is quite new to
me and it's kind of a mix of the both
it's from Smashbox and it's their
contour palette it just has three shades
in it I find for the big contour
palettes like the anastagia one I'd I
never got that because for me that is so
overwhelming there's so many shades that
wouldn't work for me there's just no
point those sort of things are meant for
makeup artists or or makeup enthusiasts
but a lot of the shades wouldn't suit my
skin tone so I don't really see the
point of having a huge palette this one
just has three it's got a slight kind of
matte yellowy highlights
Matt highlights I don't love as much but
this one you can use just under your
eyebrow or the tops of your cheekbones
if you like but I get most use out of
these two shades so there's a bronzer
which is like matte bronzers for like
the Too Faced one and there's a contour
shade which is slightly more gray taupe
color so you have a choice of both
depending if you want something a bit
more intense or a bit more natural and I
actually like to mix them both together
the bronze is a little bit small to kind
of swirl your brush in but it also is
really good if you do want to kind of
contour your nose or do any of that it's
a nice small palette so you can use a
little eyeshadow brush to do that I
think this is such a good little palette
and I get use out of all the shades and
it's a nice one if you're not sure if
you want to go the whole bronzer route
or contour route you kind of have both
shades there to pick from occasionally I
do use cream bronzers Chanel has a cream
bonds as thick and sometimes I draw that
on and blend it out but I find that it
takes up so much time and effort there's
just a bit unnecessary you can just use
a normal powder bronzer and this I have
from Illamasqua which is their cream
pigment in holo and I haven't used this
for ages but when I first got it I used
it and it's good if you have quite pale
skin because it's quite a pale contour
shade but again it's cream I found cream
products take a lot more a lot more
blending I used them with the Real
Techniques contour brush but it's you're
there for quite a while and I mean if
you really enjoy doing your makeup then
it can be quite fun but for their
everyday gal I don't think it's the best
option so the point of this video is to
let you know that you really don't need
to draw brown and white stripes all over
your face to look beautiful I think it
can get a little bit ridiculous work
with the shape of a face that you have
used natural enhancing products just to
shape your face slightly add a bit of
warmth add a bit of glow where you like
and keep watching those amazing
contouring videos I think they are
incredible just don't think you need to
do it on yourself every day those are my
top picks for contouring and I hope you
guys got some good recommendations from
there let me know what you think about
soul contouring things have you ever
actually tried it out yourself I have
and I looked ridiculous
thanks so much for watching and I'll see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
