nail polishes I'm a complete nail polish
freak I have like maybe over 60 or
something it's ridiculous and but I love
nail polish I think it's such an easy
way to sort of express yourself and it
sounds really cheesy but especially
going to work and you were quite natural
makeup if you edge off a bright nail
polish and I really love that so I'm
going to start by showing you my two
favorite top coats and I don't really
have a favorite base coat I use nails
inc caviar but it's not really a
favorite I just use it and IM particular
vit so if you have any base coats that
you really recommend let me know in the
comments because I'd love to try a new
one one of my favorite top coat is seche
vite and it's obviously a really famous
one I got this from sort of salon
supplies store it's lasted me ages it's
really thick and gloopy and makes the
nail polish last two ages and my other
favorite is the new bar diamond seal and
shine topcoat and new bars a really cool
brand that you can get on beautii bey
think it's cool i'll put the link below
really nice big bottles with big brushes
like i really like the handle if item
really easy to use so that's definitely
a brand i'd recommend looking into and
so yeah let's start on the nail polish
I've painted all my nails like every
different color so i can show you what
they look like on the nails as well so
i'll start with this hand this is like
the sort of bright past Sonny Collins so
first nail polish is on my thumb and
this is the Topshop pool party i bought
this recently is in one of our blog
posts it's a really nice bluey-green so
it's sort of like a mint green it's
definitely quite a lot of blue in it my
subscribing this very well but i get so
many compliments when I wear this nail
polish I really like it and I'm not
massive fan of Top Shot nail polishes I
find the brush quite short and stubby so
it's quite hard to use but this is my
favorite color
tried so far i really recommend it's
really nice especially for summer the
second polish is this one which is an SE
cute as a button and that's on this
finger so this is a nice coral color and
i bought this last year yeah I'd say
it's corraled quite a lot of pink in it
as well you can see they're really nice
again for the summer this is probably my
favorite coral nail polish and I love SC
I've got my own account of their you
know maybe like over 10 essie nail
polishes they're one of my favorite
brands a lot of people say that they
chip but they last really well on me I
think it obviously depends on the top
coat as well and but I like the size
bottles and everything so it's that one
the next one is another SC and it's mint
candy apple this is quite a well-known
nail polish I'm gonna swear you know but
that's that finger home that's a mint
green that's the topshop one and that's
the SC 1 the top shot one slightly
darker the SC's a proper past or mint I
mean I say main green but actually I
think it's very blue it's more blue I've
had this one for years i think is nearly
finished actually and probably had over
a year and I definitely this is probably
my favorite polish I think that's quite
hard to pick one but i always get back
to this one and it's so easy to wear and
it looks nice all the time the next
polish is a new one and one I'm
absolutely loving it's pixie from their
new pixie glory and flow range
collection which is with Disney and
Tinkerbell and this is called um I can't
remember what this is called but I'm
going to put it below it's really hard
to read on the actual bottle but first
of all I love the bottle shape of these
they're completely different to any
other nail polish as you can see they're
thin and long and I can imagine five
loads of these it must be so nice and
easy to stalk they don't take up much
space it was has a really nice long
brush which I like because it's really
easy to sort put on Paul
in one swipe and that's this color so
it's not showing up for that bright but
it's actually a really bright neon pink
i recently bought a nail polish from
american apparel one of their neon
polishes and i was really disappointed
that it wasn't that neon that this one
is actually really really bright pink
and i absolutely love it i've been
wearing it over a week every day which
was something i normally change my
polish every two days so I'm completely
obsessed with this I'm really really
happy it lasts really well and when you
look at it in the bottle it's got sort
of gold shimmer but that doesn't show up
on the nails which is a bit of a shame
and the polish also comes out quite
matte but I always put the top coat so
it's shiny but yeah really really love
that also got loads of compliments were
in that one the next one is a mua polish
and I don't really have that much stuff
from anyway but I got this at the launch
of the love hearts collection and this
is you rock that's the name you rock and
this is the polish it's it's funny when
you look it up on your own on its own
you think it's sort of a purple when you
compare it to the other purple polish in
the collection this is a very very blue
toned purple and I've got it on that
finger there it's really nice i like
this because it's unlike any other kind
of polish that I've seen this or blue me
purple color and think it's really nice
it's good quality nail polish I mean
it's really cheap hot I think it's like
a pound or something so i definitely
recommend that one and that's out at the
moment in superdrug so that's that hand
so that's all those colors that anyway
pixie SC SC topshop and in the next hand
I've got here I'll show you each one
separately first one is love this polish
this is from look beauty look magazine
recently launched their own beauty right
would look beauty and this is their nail
polish bling I've written about this
loads in my blog it's a powder pink
glitter and I've put it on this finger
so right my camera doesn't really
so I'm sorry if you can't see how try
and do a blog post with this as well so
you can see the thing I love about this
most glitter polishes you have to put on
like four or five layers until it's
thick but this one like it is obviously
shaky you have to shake it loads like
with one swipe yeah really really thick
layer of glitter and it looks like
proper solid glitter I just I absolutely
love it I wear this all the time and
it's incredible I do put on two coats
just to be safe and make it look better
and then top coats make it glossy but
you don't really need two phones you can
easily have one and I just a really
highly highly recommend this and i love
this polish so good best lyssa polish
have tried the next one is another SC
polish and this is in moreno cool this
is a really nice sort of autumn winter
color it's a topi purpley brown it's
quite purple in the camera that's what
it looks like on um this thing that's
really nice really like chic classic
quite mature sometimes if I don't want
to have like extravagant nails I just
put this all over and just think it's
really nice and it goes with so many
different outfits really easy and it
just looks quite luxurious I think the
next one I bought when I was in Miami
from Sephora and this is around the time
the muppets collection was released and
Rainbow Connection completely sold out
and it looks so nice that's really upset
then I saw an OPI for Sephora have this
polish called sparktacular and it's
actually a glitter topcoat so it looks
like that it's multicolored glitter like
silver blue orange green like whatever
colors in there in sort of different
size circles so like that and I've
painted it on just by itself to show you
but I'd normally put on top of something
so it kind of looks like that so if you
can see that clearly but it's so nice
like when you apply it it goes on quite
uneven it's quite hard to get
can even layer this is all sort of
different shapes and stuff if you apply
it onto the right nail polish it looks
really good and I'll show you in a
minute what I wear it on top of but I
just love it it's pretty much exactly
the same as Rainbow Connection it's OPI
far as it probably is exactly the same
and it's just got a different name but
I'm really happy I got that it's a
massive bottle I think OPI polishes are
just unnecessarily big but hopefully
I'll get through the next one is another
sort of glitter polish I sure don't know
if it is litter I don't know how it
subscribes um but this is the
fashionista mystical dragon fashionistas
a sort of quite near brand I think
superdrug where you can build your own
palettes and stuff but they also do nail
polish and this isn't a color I would
normally pick but it's really cool when
I wear a lot of people admit like come
up with a scheme on my nail polish it
looks like this so it's bright sort of
metallicy blue-green shimmer it point
doesn't show up as good on camera as it
as it looks but it's really quite
amazing color let's solve holographic
and again I'll so impressed like one
coat of this and you get thick layer of
Polish you don't even need to put on
another coat so like I'd say the
fashionista and look the best quality
for sort of getting without having to
put two layers on which is really funny
cuz I'd like the cheapest ones but yeah
it's really good though it has a sort of
similar lid to Chanel once we takes off
in this small ledge inside it's quite
annoying song gets stuck quite a lot so
the packages of achieve but the polish
is good so that's all that matters
really so that's fashionista you can get
it from superdrug and then the final one
is soya jewels and Zoya I've got a
couple of polish systems lawyer it's
kind of I never really thought about it
before but I saw in America and so I'm
going to try one and they're really good
quality and really easy to apply nice
packaging with like a nice little it's
quite easy to hold and this is the color
I wear underneath the sparktacular
glitter top codes if you
it's sort of i'll show you here it's
sort of like a gold shimmer that's
really sheer like if you are in this own
it's pretty nude like you wouldn't we
have to see see it much but it's really
nice and subtle and it's just kind of
quite different to anything else and i
wear that underneath the glitter top
coats and they go really well together
so that's oya jewels and that's really
pretty that's my top 10 favorite nail
polishes I hope you like them this is
all of them together so let me know if
any of those are also your favorites and
what your favorites are because I'm
obsessed as nail polish and always love
trying new ones so let me know you can
recommend any and I hope you enjoy the
