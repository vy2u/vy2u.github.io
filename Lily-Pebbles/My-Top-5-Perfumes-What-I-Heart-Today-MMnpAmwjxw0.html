top 5 favorite perfumes and this one was
actually really easy to pick I only
really have 5 favorite perfumes I'm very
picky with my perfumes so I don't
normally like the sort of popular ones
that in magazines don't really know why
I just I always try I really want to
like perfume especially because they
love packaging so much and some have
really nice bottles but I never liked
them I really don't like sweet perfumes
so I'm my passion taste is quite
expensive which is really annoying
because I had to spend more but the
quality's better and I love my 5
perfumes that I've picked so I'll start
with the obvious ones which are my dip
teak perfumes that I talked about quite
a lot first one is please excuse my bad
French long bird on low which is this
one and so it's really hard to describe
parfum smells so I did a research to
sort of look into how the brands
describe the perfumes as well because it
might help um but this was the first one
I got from dipped teak and I got it in
the full-size which is a hundred mil and
I really love this one most persons I
like a resource of green and fresh
there's the perfumes I go for quite
fruity as well but not in a sweet way in
a more the green leafy way so again they
describe this one as I put up here on
piece of paper lush garden at waters
edge with roses and blackcurrant
so you can definitely smell the
blackcurrant but it is quite green as
well and I really really like this one I
can't decide if this is my favorite
dipped eek one or the other one which I
will now show you which is philosophers
and this is their most popular perfume
by far I actually went to a diptych
event last week and they told me that
these two are actually their most
popular scents so this one I got in the
smaller bottle because I also have a
roll-on and oil perfume of it so this is
the 50ml I actually really like the size
bottles give your handbag Veloster kiss
is the fake perfume and I love fake
perfumes I always have my mom wears them
a lot so I've always always sort of love
smack jo Malone also do one which is
faking cassis and which I do like I
prefer this one I saw something nearly
finished this one actually and I
definitely be buying another one I
didn't if you've ever said fake perfume
but they're all quite similar they're
very green fresh and leafy and I think
this sort of perfume works all year
round as well which I really like this
one's slightly more summery but I do
wear it all year round this one is
definitely an all year I love it that's
probably my favourite perfume then I
have my Jeremy lone perfume which I
recently spoke about in my July
favorites and that's the wild blue bell
cologne I got this in the smaller size
but I think I might buy the full size
when I run out because I really love it
and I couldn't describe it might July
favorites I couldn't read the swear of
the smell because I don't even really
know what bluebells smell like but I
looked at their website and they
described it as vibrant sapphire
delicate sweetness it's a fused with
lily of the valley elegant luscious or
the twist of persimmon I don't know
that's how you say that um but it's
really lovely I'd recommend trying it
it's kind of fresh and fruity but with
an edge like I said with a twist it's
not little average fruity perfume and
it's really really lovely and I think
this works well in the evening as well
so those are sorts of my dip seeking
german-owned perfuse which are more
expensive but they're so lovely and I
really think they're worth the money
they don't go powered real of perfumes I
like the snow when I first spray it but
then after sort of an hour so it's a
really powdery and then me and my mum
always test perfumes together we both
have exactly the same thoughts and
perfumes we always get really
disappointed after an hour and they just
don't smell the same on your skin so
always try perfume on that's another
thing with perfume just don't just smell
them in the bottle because they smell
different on everyone like my friend
wears a similar perfume to me and they
smell completely different on both of us
so it's really important you try it on
don't get like pressured from the
counter try it on and walk around and
see how it sort of develops on your skin
and the next person I really like is the
Armani L or she perfume I've had this
so as a teenager my sister used to wear
this I think which is why I bought it
and I really liked it as well this is
much more like a readily available
perfume and I think a lot of people wear
it as well it's I don't even know I
don't even think it's like a perfume I
would choose now it's just that it
reminds me of like being a teenager and
the smell is really like familiar to me
so I do still really like it I don't
wear it that often anymore
um they describe this is floral /
oriental so it's got oriental fruit
jasmine and lower tones of sader vanilla
and musk so yeah that's kind of the
fragrance tones in it but it's really
nice more of an evening one I definitely
wear this in the evening not so much in
the daytime and more sort of autumn
winter time as well as like the
opposites of fresh and green which all
the other ones are and then the final
one is another source of teenage perfume
that I've worn for ages and ages and
it's Dolce and Gabbana light blue
another one which is very popular I
think everyone I know has this perfume
somewhere in their collection and the
bottles really big and clunky which I
don't like means you can't take it away
with you but it sits on my dressing
table and I've actually had this one for
ages there's like that much left I
probably wouldn't buy again because I've
sort of moved on now I found other
perfumes that are a bit more grown-up
but I just do like it reminds me of
sorts of fun holidays I went on when I
was younger this is much more like a
strong perfume and that's another thing
I found the performance they don't last
that well with me like no matter what
even if I spend a lot they just don't
last I know that you sort of don't smell
it on yourself after a while but I'm
sure they just don't last for me but
this one always seems to last went well
because it's sort of extra strong and
whenever I see whenever I've someone
what was passed in the street wearing it
I can always tell straight away I'm like
very dmg like blue um so this one's
described as light floral and fruity
with apple bluebells jasmine bamboo and
white rose with hints of cedar wood
amber and musk so Bluebell seems to be
making and pairing
quite a few of my perfumes as well as
Jasmine so it's quite good to know sort
of what sense you like I always find
that hard and I'm looking for a new
perfume and they asked like what what
sorts of fragrances do you like I never
really know how to describe them so it's
quite a good idea to look into the ones
you've got and see what sorts of
ingredients are in there so you can sort
of tell the shop assistant
what sorts of fragrances you like so
yeah that's the final one and these two
definitely sorts of younger easier to
get your hands on fragrances and then
the dip teeth ones and the germ alone I
sort of my more grown-up fragrances
which I'm definitely buying more of
these kind of things as I grow up I just
prefer the smell of them and I like that
they're a bit different as well I feel
like a lot of people wear these perfumes
but I do like them all so those are my
top five favorite perfumes I hope you
found that interesting let me know if
you'd like me to do any more top 5
videos I'll have a think of what I can
do them on and also they forget I've got
a giveaway going on at the moment for a
neon candle so I'll put the link to that
video below and don't forget to enter so
