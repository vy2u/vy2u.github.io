since I've done a makeup collection and
storage video not much has changed since
then but I have changed the layout of my
makeup and Anna came over a while ago
and we did like a big clear out I really
needed to get rid of some of the stuff
but I wanted to show you how I kind of
store my makeup my daily makeup and
spare makeup now obviously because of
what I do I have I call its spare makeup
it's kind of stuff that I don't use
every day but that I need to keep in
case I want to write a blog post or I
need to do a comparison post or I do a
video and I need to mention products so
I kind of keep them separate I have my
daily makeup and then I have my blogging
makeup so I thought I'd talk you through
how I store at all kind of show you a
bit of what I've got it's not perfect
I've tied it up a bit but I haven't
tried to make it perfect for this video
this is just kind of what naturally
works for me where I'm living now I'm
sure things will change at the moment
this is just what works for me so I'm
gonna talk you through my makeup how I
store it and I really hope you guys
enjoy it okay so welcome to my bedroom
this is my IKEA drawers I don't love it
it's not perfect but it's what I have
and it has three quite large drawers
down there which I use for clothes and
pajamas and stuff so it's quite handy
this is where I keep my daily makeup so
I use these clear Muji drawers for the
things that I want to use on a daily
basis obviously I don't use it all but
it's the few options I know I want to
have daily and I keep my brushes here
and most of my palettes there let me
take you closer so you can see how I
store it and which makeup bits I have in
my daily collection okay so let's talk
through brushes first I know I have far
too many but these are the brushes that
I like to use and I like to store them
in pots the two jars on the outside are
old dipped teak handles I just let them
burn right to the bottom and then poured
out the extra wax and the wick and then
just cleaned them out the middle one is
from H&amp;amp;M home which there's a true love
story never ends and I love that one
I've also just piled them on three books
just so they're slightly higher easier
to reach and I also think it looks
pretty I have a few pallets wedged
either side of the brushes these are
sort of my most used pallets I have my
three naked palettes on the right naked
one naked two and naked three and on the
Left I have
my main mac palettes and my NARS blush a
palettes so in the two little side
drawers I keep the rest of my palettes
in the right-hand drawer I keep my busy
art palette my NYC best of Broadway
palette my L'Oreal la palette nude my
Laura Mercier palettes and my Too Faced
chocolate bar palette in the left hand
drawer I keep my two tomforde palettes
cognac sable and orchid haze I also keep
two Charlotte Tilbury palettes the dolce
vita and fallen angel I also keep my
very well used wire cell culture palette
and the Clinique palette that I love for
travel I also have my Bobbi Brown rich
chocolate palette and two chanel
palettes Jose and charming from last
Christmas okay so let's go back to the
right side and this is where I keep my
eyeliners and my primers and a few
little tools that I use on a daily basis
I keep all my eyeliners in this clear
Muji pots but what I've actually done is
used a clear elastic band to bunch
together my black liquid liners and my
brown liners which are probably the two
that I use the most just so it's easy
for me to grab a bunch and then pick
from there in this little tray here
which again is from Muji I have a few
different primers like one from Pixie
Tom Ford Chanel Dior Trish McEvoy and
keels I also have my benefit puff off
here and a little hourglass primer this
is also where I keep my tweezers my
eyelash curlers my urban decay eye
primer I also have a Charlotte Tilbury
magic cream because I've been trying
that out again recently ok so let's go
into these drawers here which is where I
keep my daily eye makeup in this drawer
here I have mainly cream eyeshadows I've
got my chubby 6 for eyes from Clinique
Charlotte's Hillberry cream eyeshadows
one from Rimmel a couple from Tom Ford
Estee Lauder Maybelline and I also have
some Kiko shadows and Bobby Brown liner
which I bought recently and this is
where I keep my eyeliner sharpener down
here I also have some cream shadows from
by Terry and Kiko in the second drawer
is where I keep my mascaras and eyebrow
products I know I have a lot of mascara
is here but I like to try different ones
every now and again depending on the
look so I've got my Anastasia brow Wiz
and my 7 Glory archery over here and
clear brow gel then I have a couple of
clinic mascaras a couple from Tarte one
from Maybelline one from
l14 Max Factor make up forever stealer
and Armani okay let's head over to the
left Tower and I love this side because
the top opens like this which is very
handy and up here is where I keep all my
concealers I can't really get you any
closer than that but I'm sure you know
what concealers I have I have something
NARS Charlotte Tilbury Clarins makeup
forever
Laura Mercier and I also have my Mac
mineralized skinfinish powder up here as
well the only problem with these Muji
drawers as they do get very grumpy and
as you can see is lots of fingerprints
in this second drawer is where I'm
keeping my current favorite foundations
and powders that I like to use I have a
powder from for draw and hourglass I
also have the Kiko foundation Charlotte
Tilbury Foundation NARS sheer glow and
the Burberry fresh glow foundation
there's an Estee Lauder CC cream back
there as well which I haven't tried yet
third drawer down is where I keep my
bronzers highlights and blushes that I'm
currently using I try to switch this up
kind of every week or so for some of the
things of the sea stay like the soap &amp;amp;
Glory solar powder Charlotte Tilbury
film-star bronze &amp;amp; Glow I've also got an
hourglass blusher a tart blusher Nas
blusher NYX blusher Chanel and Jemma kid
highlighter as well okay see these
bottom five drawers are where I keep my
lip products and I used to have them
hidden away because it does look a bit
excessive like this but I just wasn't
using them and I found that when they
set out like this I use them more and I
can see what I've actually got so there
is some kind of order to them roughly an
order that I understand so let's go to
the top drawer first in here is where I
keep some of my lip glosses I have a lot
from Tanya burr they're my favorite type
of lip gloss and I also had a few for
Bobby Brown as well one from Maybelline
and I think back here is one from boxer
and Charlotte Tilbury in the second
drawer I have a few more glosses and
some bombs - I have my Clarins instant
light glossy balms a few lip glosses
from Chanel here are the kind of
high-end lip glosses and some Rimmel
ones as well and then my Revlon lip
butters and Clarins instant light bomb
in the third drawer is where I keep my
reds so I have arranged here from Revlon
Rimmel Charlotte's Hillberry Clinic NARS
bourgeois and then all my kind of red
lacquers and matte lip pencils here from
Sephora and NARS and bourgeois fourth
drawer is where I keep my pinky nudie
tone lipsticks and the majority of my
MAC lipsticks as well so all my Mac
down here I have a couple from Tom Ford
a couple from rimmel a few from
Charlotte Tilbury
kiko and a couple from Zeo as well the
bottom drop is where I keep my kind of
bold lipsticks puffiness this is my lip
oil Papa shouldn't be in there
everything else is dark bold lip dark
pink it's also I keep with my lip
pencils as well these again were hidden
away until recently because I found that
I wasn't really using them but now that
they're here I'm getting a good use out
of them so that is everything from what
I call my daily makeup collection this
is stuff I actually use the stuff that I
buy the stuff that I want for myself for
my own face I'm gonna take you now over
to my other makeup section which is more
for blogging purposes not necessarily
stuff that works for me that stuff that
I want to keep in case I need to blog
about it or put it in a video this is
more kind of like work-related stuff
please excuse this candle going mental I
forgot to trim the wick but for my other
makeup I use the Alex IKEA jaws and I've
had these for a while absolute you love
them they're great and on top as you can
see I keep my ridiculous perfume
collection I am a perfume hoarder I love
perfume I can't get rid of any of them
but I do love them all I've made sure I
don't have any that I don't like so let
me take you through the drawers as you
can see I've labeled the drawers using
my brand new label maker that I'm
obsessed with and if you want to hear
more about it it will be in my January
favorites video I put a little picture
on my Instagram I'm obsessed and I've
used it for labeling my makeup drawers
and it's great so in this top drawer as
you can see on my lipsticks I have this
clear separator which i think is from
Muji but these are the lipsticks that I
don't really wear but I can't really get
rid of because I feel like I might need
to keep them in case it's a bit
ridiculous there's just a range of stuff
from like a few high-end Tom Ford
lipsticks quite a few kind of bourgeois
Rimmel Revlon types a few like Bobby
Brown pencils lots of reds just things I
feel like I can't get rid of but I don't
really use these on a daily basis in the
second drawer as you can see from the
label is blushes okay so this drawer is
slightly different I'd say out of every
makeup item that there is blusher is my
all-time favorite and I absolutely love
kind of collecting and trying new
blushes so this drawer I do kind of dip
into I'd say weekly and I try to switch
up my daily blusher and work my way
through my collection but I do genuinely
love all the blushes that I have this
drawer looks a little
messy but there is some kind of order to
it as I said I didn't really tidy up
these drawers especially for the video
this is just kind of them in their raw
state this blushes from gosh and then
all of these here from tarts I really
love their 12-hour blushes they're such
great quality and then I also have for
Mac blushes here as well here in the
front I've just got a couple from Mac
and NARS and Chanel one from the balm
Revlon and two from hourglass at the
back here is where I keep all my kind of
cream blushes and watercolor blush
anything with kind of a creamy watery
formula and here's a more cream blushes
but these ones come in stick forms I
usually kind of use these in the summer
so I keep them in here and and switch
them up when it's warmer okay so the
next door as you can see is bronzers and
highlighters I have some different
highlighters and contour kits from Kiko
soap &amp;amp; Glory Mac Topshop and it's a mix
of cream and powder here on this that
I've bronzers mainly powder like Revlon
benefits bourgeois Body Shop and then I
have a cream on from Chanel and this
kind of contour pen form torch at the
back there I have a huge Tom Ford
bronzer and then here ouch and then here
is just kind of some tools like pencil
sharpeners and shadow shields next up
team oyster eise's which obviously
stands for word tinted moisturizers what
a mess I haven't found the perfect way
to store these but I actually find it's
helpful for me to just have them all
laying down it doesn't look pretty but
it works so this row is tinted
moisturizers from Laura Mercier's you
are a NARS
Shantay ID or Kevyn Aucoin benefit and
then I have some primers here or that
sole is a tinted moisturizer Laura
Mercier prying at hourglass Clarins and
then these are kind of tinted primers
you know the source of like bronzing
liquids back here I have a couple of SPF
and a couple of BB creams as well okay
let's move on to foundations similar to
the tinted moisturizers I find just line
them down works best for me it doesn't
look pretty but it works this drawer
probably needs another clear out soon
again these are foundations that either
have like more than one shade of that I
need to keep in Keith in case they
change the shade of my skin and the
summer or winter and ones I keep kind of
research purposes or writing blog posts
I don't really use all of these daily
anymore
but I have some from Chanel by Terry
Armani Burberry YSL drugstore ones from
L'Oreal Revlon Rimmel bourgeois Liz L
Mac Laura Mercier and I have a few kind
of round of Casillas at the back and
cream foundations here okay the final
draw eyeshadows so I shadows that I
don't really use daily but I want to
keep I have kind of a palette from MUA
this Urban Decay palette which is so
bright I won't use it but I kind of need
it for fancy dress from a few budget
shadow quads that I like to bring out
every now and again some kind of glitter
and bright shades I don't use I have
quite a few cream eyeshadows here as
well an eye shadow singles that just
don't fit into my daily collection but I
do like to use like the L'Oreal ones and
the NARS ones so that's it for these
drawers the two drawers below are empty
and then the one at the bottom is
richest man drawer
so that's on my makeup I know it's quite
a bit but hopefully you guys enjoyed
having a little nosy through and seeing
how I store it all let me know if you
did get any kind of storage tips or you
have any tips on me if you watched this

that that way then let me know I would
love to know see you guys on Tuesday for
