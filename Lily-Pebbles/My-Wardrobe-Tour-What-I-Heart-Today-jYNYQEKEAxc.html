tour of my wardrobe I thought you guys
might find it interesting to have a
little nosy through this is my wardrobe
here it's pretty huge
I don't really share it with rich
because he kind of moved into my bedroom
after I've got it so he has a bit of
space and he has some drawers outside it
but yeah most of it it's just for me
which is very naughty but let's get
started I'm gonna show you through the
whole wardrobe so yeah I hope you enjoy
it so this is the first side of my
wardrobe and I really like to hang my
clothes if I could I would hang all my
clothes up they're just easier to see
and I just a looks tight neater and like
all the things that are folded I hardly
ever wear so if I could I'd hang
everything but I can't this is just one
side of my wardrobe on this side there's
some richness shirts and jumpers and
then I've got my kind of jumper dresses
I picked this big fairy grey one from
Zara which I really love and these hang
is I think they're from Ikea and they're
they're kind of sticky ones so your
clothes that slip off I'm really weird
and really into like my hangers and
whenever I go to a Topshop H&amp;amp;M I always
ask to keep my hangers because they have
good ones I hate the ones that kind of
loop under there just like the ones that
go like that I'm weird I know so I've
got some jumpers I've got this nice
green studded one from Topshop I've got
cardigans this is a jumper from Free
People so any kind of thick jumpers I
don't really want to fold I like to hang
up here and then I've got my shirts I've
got a denim shirt and I've got this one
from monkey which you guys seen me wear
a lot I really like this like a flannel
shirt I also have my Topshop t-shirt
dress I hang that up too because I think
it keeps it neater then I've got my sort
of more evening shirts this kind of
galaxy print one from romwe and I've got
Topshop shirt and then it goes into more
dresses dresses that I wear to weddings
I don't really wear kind of smart
dresses that often obviously I like to
keep them hung up so then
nice and neat I have this one actually
which is from where's this for my cotton
but it's called
yeah traffic people which you can get a
concession in Topshop and they have a
shop as well in London this is really
nice actually I wore this to my sister's
wedding I think and I also have this is
the dress I wore to my graduation which
is a Topshop dress it's just white and
floaty so I keep some of my dresses here
and like one-off pieces that I don't
want to fold this is a little kind of
history proper toppy thing and then I
have jackets I keep most of my coats
downstairs by the door like hung up on
the coat thing or just over the
banisters um but I keep my little
jackets in here I have this one from
next I've got a few jackets from next
actually from when I did the photo shoot
with them which I'll link below if you
want to see it these two are really nice
there's this black and white monochrome
one and then this kind of rainbow a
colorful one I really like little
jackets they're good for worrying over
loose tops like this that I always wear
and I have these hanging on jo Malone
scented hangers which are so nice I
think these are such a nice gift
it smells like they're pear perfume a
comical it's called they smell amazing
and they make the whole wardrobe smell
nice so I've got two of those and
they're really nice I put like my nice
jackets on this and I've got my wrong
way jacket which I absolutely love and
I'm sure you've seen all over my
Instagram and then I have some Blazers
and a few more jackets as well this one
is from a sloth I don't really wear it I
don't know if it's that me but it's kind
of cool definitely still keeping it and
my Zara one with the leather jackets
these are the hangers that I hate these
are the hangers all talking about I
really don't know how Kangas like that
so keeping that one on the end where no
one can see at the top here it's just
Rich's mess or with hoodies and kind of
lounge clothes and so I won't show you
that it's a bit messy up there yeah this
is where I hang most of my clothes and
then I'm going to show you down here
where there's a couple of drawers with
clothes in as well so this is where I
keep all my folded tops that can't
really be hung up I like to roll my
clothes instead of folding them on top
of each other I roll them and put them
like that so I can see everything I just
have some long-sleeve tops a few shirts
a few t-shirts it's stuff that I don't
really wear that often
because all the stuff I do worth hanging
up so yeah tops in there and more
t-shirts in here some of my summer
clothes are in here and some long-sleeve
kind of Hollister and Abercrombie tops I
don't really wear that much anymore but
all that kind of stuff are in these
drawers here so this is the other side
of my wardrobe and this has more
compartments to it so I didn't say I
forgot to mention this wardrobe is from
Ikea and it's one of the ones you can
build yourself so you can decide what
compartments you have which is really
good it's also quite hard there to
actually think about and I've changed
mine's a few times because sort of what
I've wanted for my wardrobe has changed
as I've grown up so this is the other
side's a bit more complicated it's got a
few sections I wanted to have here a
long section to hang my jeans and
trousers I don't like to fold them I
think that's the normal thing to do is
to fold jeans but I like to have them
hanging up as I said before so I can see
everything keeps them kind of neater and
that's just how I like it so I have my
jeans here up there I have some jumpers
kind of my more special jumpers hoodies
a stuff get hidden away in other drawers
but those are my nice jumpers and then
here this is the section I really like I
thought it'd be nice to have a little
part of my wardrobe where I can hang
either new clothes or clothes I want to
wear more often it's kind of like a
little inspiration section or something
like that and then I have some jewellery
and underwear drawers and shoes down
there which I'll show you in a minute so
I'm going to do this section first which
I really like and here is where I hang
all my tops like this like the one I'm
wearing this is from Topshop and I
absolutely love it I wear this all the
time with skinny jeans so I have a lot
of them in different colors say I have
one in plum orange blue and black and
the one I'm wearing I keep all of these
hanging here because they're what I wear
all the time I also have this really
nice slouchy top from Zara which I like
to wear and it's kind of charcoal II
great color really comfortable I like
just lose tops in skinny trousers that's
kind of just the style I like to wear
hanging in here I also have a few little
nice tops that I don't want to get lost
in the other side of the wardrobe this
one is from next and this one I wore to
my birthday my 25th birthday it's got
buttons down the back it's kind of sheer
and it has this velvet and then a
see-through bit here and that's from
Topshop I really like that's good got a
little color as well which is nice also
in here
my loose shirts from H&amp;amp;M these are all
the same style I have one in peach I
have one mint and I have one on black
and either more summer because they're
lot lighter but they're really pretty
and I didn't want them to get damaged in
the other side so I keep these in here
and then I also have a couple of other
pieces this shirt is from Topshop and I
really like this green khaki shirt and
this is my bright blue jumper that I
showed in my other video from Topshop
and this kind of cheers me up when I see
it just because of the color so here all
my jeans and charles's or skirts and
shorts I hang to her hanger so there
most of the really jeans from Topshop so
I have to denim they're just different
sizes because I keep changing sizes all
the time and so I have my denim ones my
black ones I've also got green car key
ones and maroon colored I have more
summery colors hanging together so these
kind of mint blue ones and then the
lighter denim as were only really wear
that is in the summer I also have my
American Apparel disco pants hanging in
here and leggings like leather leggings
either from Topshop leather panel down
the side in my American Apparel leggings
as well and then I also have trousers in
here these ones are from Zara which I
absolutely love I tend to wear these
when it's a bit warm up if they're quite
thin and these ones are from Topshop oh
that open I'll shoot that side this is
it they have a nice like floral print
and I also hang my skirts in here so
I've got this leather skirts from
Topshop this tartan wine is from Topshop
and then I think the black ones also
from Topshop at West Coast that often
I'd like to ask gets in the winter with
thick tights and then I always have a
few pairs of shorts in there including
these from monkey which are just a
really nice fit then and there I have
known white and denim most of my summer
clothes
I keep downstairs in a different room I
don't like to kind of clutter my
wardrobe too much so I tried to change
it depending on the season so when
summer's over not that we really have a
summer but I move everything downstairs
and same with like big thick jumpers
when it's summer remove that downstairs
and I have all my kind of summer clothes
when I go on holiday in a separate
drawer with bikinis and stuff so don't
keep everything in here so up here I
have my jumpers I'll just grab a few I
have this often gap black confirmation
mm Urban Outfitters these are just kind
of the nice little jumpers of prints
them any big jumps either hanging or
hoodies are folded and another
this is where I keep my jewellery in
this drawer which I got this whole thing
fitted in Ikea it came as one and there
is a lock if you want to but I don't
really use it so it here's all my
jewelry and it's a little bit of a mess
it's quite hard to arrange a draw like
this but I have my rings have this kind
of ring and this one's from Topshop and
then I just have loads of necklaces you
know I love my big statement necklaces
but that one from Topshop
this one's from Zara this one's also
Topshop most of it up shop I love this
one I wear it all the time yes it's just
all my rings and necklaces and bracelets
I have a few nice pieces from Tiffany's
from when I was younger I was quite into
Tiffany's my birthday's but rest of them
mainly let Topshop and Zara necklaces in
this drawer below is where I keep my
belts and any other kind of bits I need
to store so got a few like jewellery
boxes this is where I keep my lovely
Chanel purse that I got for my
graduation present
but yeah mainly belts in here I have my
piece belt from Urban Outfitters I don't
actually wear belts that often but I
have a few that I like I like this one
from Topshop I mainly wear them when I'm
wearing like a loose dress to fit it
around the middle and I keep some
sunglasses in here as well oh I'll show
you this as well this is a little
scented cushion from Joe Malone and I
have a couple of these I have one here
just under my tops smells amazing and I
keep one in my underwear drawer there
I'm not going to show you my underwear
drawer because I really don't think
that's very interesting but yeah this do
I keep my underwear and yeah that's
basically this section done so this is
where I keep a lot of my shoes I'm not
gonna lie most of them live by the front
door but when I feel any bothered I
bring them up here and yeah they're just
the boss of my wardrobe I have my new
trainers from Topshop these are my
Hudson boots which I wear every day I
absolutely love them I have my Tom went
Tom's wedges at the back and some white
trainers from next I have my cutout
boots from Topshop as you can see there
are lots of black boots but I'm
hopefully gonna do an actual shoe video
soon so I'm not gonna show you too much
but sandals and flip-flops at the back
and yet all my shoes are kind of just
down here there's summer downstairs as
well any scarfs and hats
it's like that I keep next to my
wardrobe in a big IKEA box like this
have my American Apparel neon hat which
I love and then all my scarves have just
folded up in they're easy to get when I
want to wear them so that's my wardrobe
I hope you like seeing inside it's not
that exciting I'm no kind of fashionista
but I like to keep things tidy when I
can it does get messy I'm not gonna lie
I'm quite a messy person but when I do
kind of do little clear route and go
through it it's the best feeling and I
love when things are tidy in my wardrobe
because it just means that I can wear
the stuff I really like and it doesn't
get lost and when I buy new clothes
especially I hate putting new clothes in
a messy wardrobe so that's why I have
that little section on the side for new
stuff and nice stuff so yeah I hope you
liked watching that please give this
video a thumbs up if you did because it
took ages to film and that would make me
really happy
thanks so much for watching and I'll see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
