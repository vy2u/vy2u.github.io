to nas is summer 2012 collection I went
to an oz event last week and it was sort
of a master class it was amazing i had
the best night of my life there were
about 16 bloggers and we all had a table
sort of each like between four of us and
we sat down and had one of those massive
nas laptop things that they have the
counters with sort of every eye shadow
color and blusher in and we just had a
night of playing with niles products
which was amazing but they introduced us
to the new summer 2012 collection as
well as a few other product launches and
showed us how to sort of get a look with
them so i thought i'd share it with you
because it really is amazing so the
first thing i want to talk about is any
tinted moisturizer gone here it's living
the nice packaging still in love niles
packaging so to take out this so the new
tinted moisturizers look like this they
are they come in nine different shades I
was actually the lightest shade which is
Finland which is quite funny i am it was
lighter than people think I am but I was
quite surprised to be the lightest shade
the whole thing about this is oil-free
has anti aging and skin brightening and
benefits to it it's buildable so it can
be used a set of foundation something
some moisturizers are really thin but
this is it's quite a buildable one it's
really nice a sort of work in from the
center of your face out and this is what
they used in all the new campaigns for
their summer 2012 collection so and i
can't find out how much this is i'm
literally surrounded by press releases
right now I can't find a price for this
I'm going to put in underneath the video
when I find out but yeah I'm going to
try this out I used on the night and I
really liked it i'm going to try out
properly and then do a review on it on
my blog so if i've done that by the time
this video goes up our link it below but
really nice as always got the mat
packaging as now as always does and yeah
so I'll come back to you on this one but
so far so good really nice tinted
moisturizer so the summer 2012
collection has nine products in it and
I've only got a few here to show you but
I'll do a blog post and I'll talk about
all the products in the collection
so I'll link that below as well but this
is basically an image of all the
products that are in there so there's
two eyeshadow palettes a trio and a giro
there's a blusher there's two lip
pencils sort of gloss pencil and a matte
pencil and eyeshadow pencil there's a
nail polish and there's also a lip to
sort of lipsticks as well so I've got
and I shall I chair the nail polish and
lip pencils show you today so this was
sort of the look that they created with
all the products and kind of the look
that they created on the evening of the
master class as well so these the tinted
moisturizer on the face and they use the
flusher this blusher here which looks
really scary and orange but they
actually use that sort of as a bronzer
and as a blush at the same time they
used it to contour and then as a blush
and it worked really well and it really
warms the face up nicely for the summer
they also use the eyeshadow trio which
I'll show you in a minute that's all all
over the lid and in the crease and then
this is the lip pencil as well it's not
the one I have Zoe actually use this
other night and it looks really nice its
orbit glossy tan colored lip Andrey it's
really nice and this is the now pushes
right as well so this was sort of the
look that we tried to get on the night
first I'll show you the nail polish so
this is the nail polish it's called true
v I'm not going to pronounce any of the
names well but it's a really nice of
light pink color um and I didn't it was
no flush to pick that last minute I
decided in this one because I don't
really wear light pink that much and I
really wanted to try it so why not on my
nails now is really nice really nice for
the summer of really clean and fresh
looking and I've never used the nas nail
polish before so when I tried it this
morning I looked really looking forward
to it it's really good quality and sort
of like Chanel bottles but actually this
comes off it hasn't got another lid
underneath so it's really easy and I
really like it so I'm going to look into
other nail nails nail polishes now I
think and they really good quality or so
far see see how it lasts but yeah really
nice summer color and that's 18 pounds
so that's obviously quite expensive for
a nail polish but if you're looking to
invest in a really good apology
and a nice color I think it is really
nice the next thing i'll show you is the
eyeshadow trio this was I think my
favorite product from the whole
collection this is called ramit well I
just can't pronounce these things and
that's in here I never get out of these
outer packaging things and it looks like
that there's sort of a silver shimmery
color peachy shimmer and then a mat
apricot so when I first saw this I
thought I wasn't really sure I thought I
don't work normally wear colors like
that it's a bit different but once they
showed us how to use it i was so
impressed so what they did is they've
got these two colors first the to
shimmer colors and they got a big fluffy
brush and they told us to blend both
together and taking sort of more the
peachy shade because having too much
silver is and that flattering so we sort
of blended them together and put them
all over the lid and that on it's only
really nice really sort of neutral
flattery and summer shimmer color event
on us with the same fluffy and brush to
get the mat apricot color and put it
just in the crease and it looked so nice
they all says that a great thing is with
this middle color the peach color you
can also use it as a highlighter with
the same brush so I put it on the top of
your cheekbones and and just above your
eyebrow and just underneath I've never
heard of putting highlighted above your
eyebrow but I was saying for the lady
how I hate my eyelids and I think
they're really droopy and she was saying
putting highlighted just above your
overall really helps like lift
everything so I did that and I really
liked the outcome I'm going to try and
sort of do it again and take a photo for
my blog so i'll let you know when i do
that and this is really nice how much is
this so this is a limited edition and
it's 33 pounds which sounds like a lot
you're getting three really nice sort of
unique i shadow colors and i really like
them I'm definitely gonna be using this
a lot the summer it you can use it so
many different ways and I just love this
apricot color it's really different I've
never seen anything like that so that's
really nice the next thing is the lip
pencil I'm actually wearing it now my
lips if you can see when I first sat
down I said cessary straight away I was
like that looks really nice it's nothing
like anything I've tried I would never
normally go for this color but I just
had a feeling it was going to really
suit me in the minute I put it on
everyone on my table was like yep that
really suits you so I love it I've never
tried an oz a matte velvet lip pencil
before this is my first one so this one
is called never say never and it's a how
would I describe this sort of a
raspberry pink um kind of thing the
velvet matte lip pencil it looks like
this and it's really easy to apply
actually in the soft pencil form you
just is like a colouring in and and also
this lasts for ages I wore on the night
and I went out for dinner afterwards
with some of the girls and after I eat
in my pizza and everything it was still
there even on the way home on the tube
so that really impressed me so they
never say never matte lip pencils 25
pounds it's really different product
it's not something I couldn't find you
like a jeep for this I don't think it
would work the reason it's so good is
because it's such high quality so it's
definitely worth the price tag and I
really like it it's a really different
color I wouldn't have thought this was a
very summer color but I think it were
really nice in the evenings in the
summer so I'm definitely going wearing
this a lot I really like it so those all
the products I have with me there are
some other great things in the
collection that you should definitely go
check out when it's our alts and the
eyeshadow duo this one is called Mary
gallant and really nice really shimmery
just amazing colors if you're something
goes out a lot and even a nice porn some
nice makeup this is a really good one to
the evening and this is an eyeshadow
pencil I love I shadow pencils they're
so easy to use so this one I definitely
go to and that's good calabria and the
blusher which is this one was so
interesting I think it will soon a lot
of different skin tones everyone and I
table used it and it suited everyone so
it's quite versatile product you can use
it so it has a bronzer or as a blusher
so that's what I'm probably be different
as well i think i might go
that one and that's called liberty
really nice so yeah it's just a really
really great collection really excited
that I got to go and child the products
and I wanted to sort of tell you guys
about it so I hoped you liked this video
I'm going to do a really long blog post
on it with loads of photos so I'll link
that below and and i think that's it
fuck i've been rambling on for ages so
i'll leave it at that thank you for
