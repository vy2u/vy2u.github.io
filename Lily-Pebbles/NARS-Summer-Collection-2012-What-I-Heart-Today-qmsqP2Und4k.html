NAS at summer 2012 collection I went to
a NAS event last week and it was sort of
a master class it was amazing I had the
best night of my life
there were about 16 bloggers and we all
had a table sort of each like between
four of us and we sat down and had one
of those massive Naz laptop things that
they have at the counters with sort of
every eyeshadow color and blusher in and
we just had a night of playing with NARS
products which was amazing but they
introduced us to the new summer 2012
collection as well as a few other
product launches showed us how to sort
of get a look with them so I thought I'd
share it with you because it really is
amazing so the first thing I want to
talk about is nu tinted moisturizer I've
gone here it's a nice packaging still in
love nice packaging so to take out this
so the new tinted moisturizers look like
this
they are they come in 9 different shades
I was actually the lightest shade which
is Finland which is quite funny I am it
was lighter than people think I am but I
was quite surprised to be the lightest
shade the whole thing about this is oil
free has anti-aging and skin brightening
and benefits to it it's buildable so it
can be used a set of foundation
sometimes some moisturizers are really
thin but this is it's quite a buildable
one it's really nice sort of work in
from the center of your face out and
this is what they used in all the new
campaigns for their summer 2012
collection so I can't find out how much
this is I'm literally surrounded by
press releases right now but I can't
find a price for this so I'm gonna put
in underneath the video when I find out
but yeah I'm gonna try this out I used
on the night and I really liked it I'm
gonna try out properly and then do a
review on it on my blog so if I've done
that by the time this video goes up I'll
link it below but really nice as always
got the mattes
packaging as now as always does yeah so
I'll come back to you on this one but so
far so good
really nice tinted moisturizer so the
summer 2012 collection has nine products
in it I've only got a few here to show
you but I'll do a blog post and I'll
talk about all the products in the
collection
so I'll link that below as well but this
is basically an image of all the
products that are in there so there's
two eyeshadow palettes a trio and a Giro
there's a blusher there's two lip
pencils sort of gloss pencil and a matte
pencil and eyeshadow pencil there's a
nail polish and there's also a to sort
of lip sticks as well so I've got and
eyeshadow trio and nail polish and a lip
pencil to show you today so this was
sort of the look that they created with
all the products and kind of the look
that they created on the evening of the
master class as well so these the tinted
moisturizer on the face and they use the
blusher this blusher here which looks
really scary and orange but they
actually use that sort of as a bronzer
and as a blush at the same time they
used it to contour and then as a blush
and it worked really well and it really
warms the face up nicely for the summer
they also use the eyeshadow trio which
I'll show you in a minute but sort of
all over the lid and in the crease and
then this is the lip pencil as well it's
not the one I have Zoe actually use this
other night and it looks really nice
it's sore but glossy tan colored lip and
really it's really nice and this is the
now pushes round saw so this was sort of
the look that we tried to get on the
night first I'll show you the nail
polish so this is the nail polish it's
called true V I'm not going to pronounce
any of the names well but it's a really
nice of light pink color and I didn't it
was no pleasure to pick that last minute
I decided in this one because I don't
really wear light pink that much and I
really wanted to try it so I'm wearing
it on my nails now it's really nice
really nice for the summer really clean
and fresh looking I've never used the
Naza nail polish before so when I try
that this morning I look really looking
forward to it it's really good quality
and sort of like Chanel bottles but
actually this comes off it hasn't got
another lid underneath so it's really
easy I really like it so I'm going to
look into other nail nails nail polishes
now I think and they're really good
quality or so far see see how it lasts
but yeah really nice summer color and
that's 18 pounds so that's obviously
quite expensive for a nail polish but if
you're looking to invest in a really
good polish
and a nice color I think it is really
nice the next thing I'll show you is the
eyeshadow trio this was I think my
favorite product from the whole
collection this is good ramit well I
just can't pronounce these things that's
in here you never get out of these parts
of packaging things and it looks like
that there's sort of a silver shimmery
color peachy shimmer and then a matte
apricots so when I first saw this I
thought I wasn't really sure I thought I
don't normally wear colors like that
it's a bit different but once they
showed us how to use it I was so
impressed so what they did is they've
got these two colors first the two
shimmer colors and they got a big fluffy
brush and they told us to blend both
together taking sort of more of the
peachy shade because having too much
silver eye isn't that flattering so he
sort of blended them together and put
them all over the lid and that on it's
only really nice really sort of neutral
flattery and summer shimmer color event
on us with the same fluffy brush to get
the matte
apricot color and put it just in the
crease and it looks so nice
bails is that a great thing is with this
middle color the peach color you can
also use it as a highlight that with the
same brush so I put it on the top of
your cheekbones and just above your
eyebrow and just underneath I've never
heard of putting highlighter above your
eyebrow but I was saying for the lady
how I hate my eyelids and I think
they're really droopy and she was saying
putting highlighter just above your
eyebrow really helps like lift
everything so I did that and I really
liked the outcome I'm gonna try and sort
of do it again and take a photo for my
blog so I'll let you know when I do that
and this is really nice how much is this
so this is a limited edition and it's 33
pounds which sounds like a lot but
you're getting three really nice sort of
unique eyeshadow colors and I really
like them I'm definitely gonna be using
this a lot the summer I think you can
use it so many different ways and I just
love this apricot color it's really
different I've never seen anything like
that so that's really nice the next
thing is the lip pencil I'm actually
wearing it now on my lips if you can see
when I first sat down I said this is
very straight away I was like that looks
really nice it's nothing like anything
I've tried I would never normally go for
this color but I just had a feeling it
was gonna really suit me in the minute I
put it on everyone on my table is like
yep that really suits you so I love it
I've never tried an oz matte velvet lip
pencil before this is my first one so
this one is called Never Say Never
it's how would I describe this sort of a
raspberry pink kind of thing The Velvet
Matte lip pencil it looks like this and
it's really easy to apply actually in
the soft pencil form you just it's like
a coloring in um and also this lasts for
ages I wore it on the night and I went
out for dinner afterwards with some of
the girls and after I'd eaten my pizza
and everything and it was still there
even on the way home on the cheap so
that really impressed me so they never
say never matte lip pencils 25 pounds
it's really different product it's not
something I couldn't find you like a
jeep for this I don't think it would
work the reason it's so good is because
it's such high quality so it's
definitely worth the price tag and I
really like it it's a really different
color
um I wouldn't have thought that this was
a very summer color but I think it would
really nice in the evenings in the
summer so I'm definitely gonna wearing
this a lot I really like it
so those all the products I have with me
there are some other great things in the
collection that you should definitely go
check out when it salts and the
eyeshadow duo this one is called Mariga
lights a really nice really shimmery
just amazing colors if you're something
goes out a lot in the evening let's
spawn some nice makeup this is a really
good one for the evening and this is an
eye shadow pencil I love eyes shadow
pencils they're so easy to use so this
one I'd definitely go chip and that's
good Calabria the blusher which is this
one was so interesting I think it was
soon a lot of different skin tones
everyone and I table used it and it
suited everyone so it's quite a
versatile product you can use it sort of
as a bronzer or as a blusher so that's
what I'm probably be looking into as
well I think I might go
that one and that's called Liberty
really nice so yeah it's just a really
really great collection really excited
that I got to go and child the products
and I wanted to sort of tell you guys
about it so I hoped you liked this video
I'm going to do a really long blog post
on it with loads of photos so I'll link
that below and I think that's it
I've been rambling on for ages so I'll
leave it at that
thank you for watching see see bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
