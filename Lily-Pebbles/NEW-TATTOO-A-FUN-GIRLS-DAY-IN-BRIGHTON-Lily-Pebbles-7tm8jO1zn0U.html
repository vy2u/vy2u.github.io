I'm off to Brighton today I'm so excited
I'm gonna be having a fun day out with
Anna Lizzie and Lindsay we always have
so much fun when we're together I don't
think Lizzie and Lindsay had ever been
to Brighton before which is crazy so
really excited to kind of show them
Bryson and and it's gonna give us like a
little tour I think and we're gonna have
lunch I'm getting a tattoo at 11 o'clock
this morning it's like the first thing
I'm doing as soon as they get there so
I'm excited and nervous um G put a photo
on her Instagram last night of the
tattoo that she's drawing for me and
it's beautiful I missed her like oh my
god is that gonna be able to be done
small because it looks huge and I really
don't end up with like a massive tattoo
she was like don't worry it could be
done small so I'm like nervous and
anxious about that part that's my least
favorite part of getting tattoos when
you have to like decide and like I
always feel really awkward like asking
with changes but it's gonna be on my
body forever so you have to just be
brave and do it but then I'm really
excited to actually have it done and
then the rest of the day is gonna be
really fun I can't wait this week has
been so short because it was back
holiday on Monday and today it's like a
non-work he day so I feel like a bit of
a bunker but it's gonna be really great
I have to go because I'm running late
and I don't want to miss my train I want
to get to Victoria a little bit early
get a tea and some buds eat on the train
and then me Lizzie and Lindsay gonna get
a train down together and it's gonna be
really fun so I'm gonna vlog all day
today and I really hope you guys enjoy
it

floor I filmed a spring wardrobe
cleaning video last week and I haven't
thought about yet today's outfit is this
top from j.crew Topshop Baker boy hat I
actually bought a new one because mine
was just getting so badly someone tried
on they had a bigger head than me and I
got really baggy so I got a new Baker
boy hat Topshop jeans and my converse
which I haven't worn in ages because the
weather hasn't been good enough and I
think it's gonna be good I think I'm
gonna wear my camel coat and then also
my saline bag because I've got lots of
cameras today and this one's a little
bit bigger than my Gucci bag

tired from all the fresh TM these two
went on a ride and the adrenaline good
lunch okay Sonny so now I'm gonna go
home and then I'm going to see my
friends he babies tonight which will be
really nice I'm home my hair is in full
on greasy mode and I thought whilst it's
still light down here I'll show you my
finished tattoo I'm so happy with it I
really love it I think it looks bigger
in photos than actually does in real
life I just went to show my sister and
she was like it looks really different
in real life rich what is that things
digging through the door seriously this
is the finished thing finished a to love
the details so much and then when I put
my arm down like I'm gonna go to my
mom's now because I think I've been sent
some tile samples I've gone there and
some other stuff as well so I'm gonna go
pick those up look this is a massive
hate blue ball sample it looks so nice
the thing with dark walls is that
everything looks nice in front of it
the Gold's bar cart will look nice like
colors just stand out in front of dark
colors that's what I love about it but
I'm very undecided on how much I'm doing
dark and how much I'm doing light but I
do love this color so much I know it's a
very like trendy color but I love it so
much that I don't think I will mind when
it goes out of fashion because it's just
it's such an amazing color it's like a
dark blue but these amazing like green
undertones to it I think it's really
special
we actually just quickly last minute
went out for dinner with my parents
which was really nice eventful tapas and
they're so funny I was like look I've
got a new tattoo
that's nice my parents are very chilled
out but I suppose I am 30 but it may be
laughs because I think rich is making
tea I'm gonna sit and edit this vlog
because it's Friday night now and this
is going up Sunday and I don't want to
be doing this tomorrow so I'm gonna get
it done tonight and I really hope you
