to 2017 God 2017 sounds like really
futuristic obviously this video has been
pre-recorded because realistically today
on the first of January I'm probably
either tidying up my parents house so
that when they come back from holiday
they're not really annoyed that I hosted
New Year's Eve in their house or lying
on the sofa crying because I just feel
so nauseous and I'm not one of those
people that is ever actually sick on a
hangover I just feel sick all day so I
didn't think that you guys would want to
see me in either of those situations so
I pre-recorded this video so that I had
something going up today on the 1st of
January and I thought it might be nice
to just sit down in a casual setting and
just chat to you guys about my New
Year's resolutions for 2017 in the past
I didn't always set news resolutions
partly because I didn't want to kind of
give myself these goals and then if I
didn't do them I just feel like a
failure well so I didn't always have
them I feel like further along I get in
my career the more I have kind of these
goals and ambition that I want to
achieve so I've got how many 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 news resolutions and I probably will
add some more looking back like because
of the industry I work in a lot changes
like every six months maybe even less I
feel like the whole industry changes so
now I'm looking back at the beginning of
2016 and I feel like I was very
different to how I am now so things are
always changing and evolving but where I
am now I have these resolutions and it's
a bit of mix of like work and personal
stuff quite a lot of my work goals I
haven't put in here because they're
quite specific but here are some general
news resolutions I thought I would tell
you guys about the first one is to be
more thoughtful I think in general I am
a thoughtful person I am a good friend
but I mean like little things like I
know people who just like send cards or
buy little gifts because they see
something they think you'd like and I
just want to be a little bit more
thoughtful like that especially with
rich and maybe with my niece and nephews
like buy them cute little gifts every
now and again or spend the day with them
take them somewhere to like a museum my
job can easily consume me so I want to
make sure that I'm being thoughtful
towards other people as well I want
find some like-minded creative people to
work with in 2017 I'm always very
envious of people like Ben Brown and
Steve Booker who seem to always surround
themselves with like-minded creative
people and unfortunately I don't know
why I don't tend to have that many of
those kind of people around me I've got
my like friends my real-life friends but
none of them are taller involved with
photography or videography or Internet
YouTube stuff and obviously I've got
Anna but she lives quite far away so I
just want to kind of find some friends
no I don't want to find some friends I
just want to spend more time with other
people who are into photography and
videography and are willing to like
share tips and advice and we can like
bounce off each other work together
brainstorm ideas I don't know where I'm
gonna find these people but I guess I
need to like Network and socialize more
I think I'm good at that but I'm going
to continue to do so and try and like
really you know stay in touch with
people eat breakfast and stay more
regulated with meals because I work from
home it's just so easy to forget about
looking after yourself in terms of like
eating even though I love food and I
love eating I'm not be found at
breakfast so sometimes what happens as I
wake up I might have a cup of tea I
don't really have breakfast and then as
much as I want to have lunch I'll get
into like a work routine or I'll stop
filming a video and before I know it
it's three o'clock and I haven't eaten
anything and that is so bad is so
unhealthy it's so not me because like on
the weekends I'm not like that at all
it's mainly because we never have
anything on the flat because I'm
terrible at food shopping it's also just
because I never know what to eat like I
like eating out when I'm home alone it's
hard to cook for one so I need to try
and get some routine where I'm eating
breakfast everyday and if I'm not eating
breakfast I'm having lunch you know at
like 12 o'clock an early lunch and it's
a good nutritious lunch not just
whatever's in the fridge I eat roasted
peppers and like couscous and red onion
like all the time just because those are
the only things we ever have in the flat
if you guys have any tips on getting
better or things like that please let me
know because at the moment I have no
plan remember people's names I think
Anna also has this on her news
resolution and we were talking about it
how it's so easy when you introduce
ourselves
one to say I think sometimes I worry so
much about making sure I say the right
thing like hi I'm Lily that when they
say I'm Sarah I feel like it just goes
like in one ear and out the other and
then immediately forgotten what their
name is and I've heard someone said that
it's quite a good thing to kind of
repeat it so like oh hi Sarah
and then you'll remember their name I
just really really want to make an
effort to try and remember people's
names because I get myself in all kinds
of sticky situations when I've met
someone like three times and I can't
remember their name I'd like to be more
digital when it comes to organization
but then still use pen and paper when it
comes to creativity and what I mean by
that is using my kind of iCal to plan my
calendar and my videos and I've got an
app where I can write lists I think for
me it works best to have those things
digital but then when it comes to
creativity and brainstorming I like to
use pen and paper so I've still got my
bullet journal I've done this for the
entire year this is my 2016 bullet
journal I'm gonna start a new one and
I'm gonna do it quite differently I
think I'll make a whole video about my
bullet journal but I think the main
difference is is I'm not gonna use my
bullet journal as a diary anymore I'm
just gonna use my iCal for that and I'm
just gonna use my bullet journal as a
kind of video blog post brainstorming
book which I don't even know if that is
a bullet journal it's just a notebook
really but I'm gonna keep index and yeah
I think when it comes to brainstorming I
like to use notebooks but everything
else I want to try and keep it digital
so nothing's lost and everything's very
organized
I want to take more non-work photos I
feel like I've got very lazy with my
photography and I've got this amazing
equipment but all I use it for is flat
layers of lipsticks and it's just such a
waste I want to take my camera out on
weekends and take pictures of my family
and take pictures of the amazing
surroundings I live in London so I
definitely want to make time for
photography I feel like because other
sort of people hang out with sometimes
to just stop on a bridge and spend 15
minutes taking photos isn't possible
because they don't want to stop and
stand on a bridge for 15 minutes but
maybe I can go up on myself or these
like-minded creative people that I make
friends with they'll do it with me I
want to comment and engage more with
content that I enjoy I'm always asking
you guys to comment on my videos or
leave me feedback but I realized that I
don't do it that much
and how can I ask you guys to if I'm not
I love it when occasionally another
youtuber will comment on my video and it
really gives me that kind of kick of
like oh I didn't know they watched my
videos it's really exciting so I really
want to make an effort to comment more
on the videos that I watch and I have
been trying to do that for the past few
weeks so I want to continue to do that
throughout 2017 comment don't just leave
like the comment just for the sake of it
like comment if I have something to say
and engage more with other content my
final news resolution is to continue to
take feedback from constructive
criticism I get online but also to focus
more on the positives and the the praise
I think because as youtubers were quite
spoiled by getting lots of comments from
people saying like they love our videos
or they like what we're wearing that
it's easy to kind of ignore the nice
ones and just focus on the bad ones if
it me it's definitely a feedback thing I
always want to improve so I always focus
on like the three terrible comments and
figure out why I've got those comments
but I think for like my own sanity I
need to focus more and I'm not talking
about the comments that say like oh
you're pretty but I am amazing comments
when you guys feedback on why you liked
the video and I think it's important for
me to acknowledge those comments as well
I do acknowledge them I do read them but
I just need to like process it more and
try not let the negative kind of
outweigh the positive it's just kind of
human nature though so those are all my
New Year's resolutions 2017 I also want
to continue with a lot of charity work
you guys know what we look good feel
better maybe I'll do some other stuff
with them this year and maybe with
another charity as well I feel like this
year I can be a bit selfish you know I'm
29 I will probably have kids at some
point soon and once you have kids it
really is all about them so this is my
last chance really to be completely
selfish to focus on work to spend my
money how I like to enjoy time with rich
when it's just us two and I'm really
excited for 2017 I feel like there's
loads of cool things there gonna be
going on and I'm just so lucky to have
this job and I appreciate every day that
I'm doing this and I'm in loving my job
so thank you guys so much for watching
my videos and commenting and please let
me know what
or news resolutions or because I've
always interested I might find some new
ones to add to my list also just a quick
like maintenance note I think I'm gonna
change my upload days to Wednesday
evening instead of Tuesday evening just
so that my Sunday video has a bit more
like err time before the next one comes
up I don't know if that's confirmed yet
though so let me know what you think I
don't think you guys care when the
videos go up anyway so it'd probably be
Wednesday 6:30 p.m. and Sunday 9:30 a.m.
see you guys in my next video and thanks
for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
