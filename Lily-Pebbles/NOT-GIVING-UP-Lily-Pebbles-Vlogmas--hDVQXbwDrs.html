the 22nd of December and they're wearing
any makeup again because this morning
I'm going to the gym and having my
personal training session an update on
my lips I know I'm boring you but they
are pretty much all healed
apart from this corner look how gross
that is it's like when the corners were
cracked but it's starting to like be a
bit gross and bulgy I haven't got a
deficiency in vitamin B or magnesium or
anything like that just need to sort out
this bit and then hopefully they'll be
alright so I'm really sorry for that it
looks a bit gross on camera I'm gonna
head to the gym now I am not feeling it
of course I'm never feeling like I want
to go to the gym I'm tired and I just
quite bothered to work out but I think
you guys along with me should wake up to
hopefully dependi if there's anyone else
in the gym or not I really need look up
an owner or something I need to get some
money out and it's absolutely freezing a
small name
that was my last gym session before
Christmas tree trust about that it was
really hard though I'm now gonna go buy
some sushi and reward myself come to
Asda because they need to get the last
part of my nephew Aces Christmas present
and anything get some like roses and
stuff for Christmas Day because I did
that my arms got any of those getting
all the essentials after after 8:00
Gillian and roses I'm home now which
hasn't got any holiday days left so
because of our honeymoon he has to work
but he gets the work from home today
which is nice he's currently having a
hissy fit because he ordered a sports
jacket and they sent what did they send
you sure it's jacket who do you want the
Catalan yes they did not do well phone
them and get really angry
I picked us us up some sushi for lunch
what's the time 12
it's definitely acceptable lunchtime I'm
gonna eat some now for a shower salmon
avocado and then I got two spicy tuna
cuz which loves those and some pickled
cucumbers each guys look I have makeup
on I feel great I just feel better like
I know I shouldn't apologise what I'd
look like without makeup on I don't
apologize you've seen it enough but I do
feel better with makeup on I've had a
shower straighten my hair and I have
makeup on I'm now gonna sit and oh my
god why is my computer screen so dusty
I've just cleaned it I'm gonna clear my
inbox till there's literally nothing
left in it hopefully and then I can feel
like I can sort of relax for Christmas
although I don't really like I know that
some people have like turned that
out-of-office on I'll be vlogging until
Christmas day so work won't really feel
like it finishes till then and then I've
got a few things to do I don't know I'm
not having like a official stop work day
this year but I am gonna try clean my
inbox just so I can start with a fresh
inbox in the new year so I'm gonna do
that now and then I'll come back to you
guys how the hell do you wrap this
seriously it's like a mountain of
awkwardly shaped things
luckily kids don't care what presents
look like when they're wrapped up they
just want to rip them open this
you literally the ugliest present I've
ever wrapped London so funny during
Christmas because loads of people like
go home for Christmas and leave London
and it just always reminds me of the
year how lucky I and my family like 15
minutes down the road well we all live
in London and it's also reminds me of
like how many people aren't actually
from London I kind of forget so
everyone's just like leaving London and
going home to ever home is I guess
though for those people it's quite good
there because they're going somewhere
where they don't normally live or I
spend a week it's really like time off
because they're like a different
location whereas I'm kind of staying in
my flat where my office is where I am
all the time so it's quite hard to like
switch off but we're gonna stay the
night at my parents on Christmas Day
which is like the house I grew up in so
that would be nice I'm at my mom's house
now and I promise this is the last time
gonna talk about my lips but I went to
the pharmacy and the guy was so helpful
he gave me a cream and I really hope
this is the last of it although I'm
gonna have a blood test which I'm very
just in case I've also got lots of post
here that I might cookie open probably
people are still sending things at this
time of year I've been setting this
candle by Guerlain and it's so pretty
but it's a bit too strong for my flat
because I've got such a small space
candles it's no really strong they're
just too overwhelming so I'm going to
give it to my mum but it's really nice
it's not like an actual perfume my mom
is making she's boiling and carrots and
super tato is on christmas we have
something that we call Sh mush sweet
potato with would you put it like butter
but if orange juice it's weird anyway
it's amazing it's like so much better
than just plain old boring mash and it
also makes a great like filling for our
leftover sandwich that we always make in
the evening I thought I would quickly
show you this stuff from two-faced I got
sent I got one of them scarves which I
really like I also got sent these cute
pins woman that's not focusing there's a
unicorn I probably wear that one and the
lashes I think the lashes are really
cool this also I thought was great if
this is the passport to bronze I dropped
my camera and I think it's trying to
focus like when I open it up it has a
little kabuki brush to travel and then
it has three like miniature versions of
their bronzes and you guys know this is
the only ones where I use is the milk
chocolate one this is Sun bunny which is
like a split half is matte half of
shimmer and then chocolate Soleil that's
their slightly darker bronzer and milk
chocolate which is the one that I use
and this is a really nice small version
which would be really good for traveling
definitely gonna keep these carrots and
the soup chaser being all mashed up I
hope that's enough I get very concerned
about the amount of food of Christmas
Day having a mince pie and cream whilst
sorting out my mom's computer because
it's also full of offer have you had a
nice day working from home yeah heating
up some of the chicken soup if you never
