about new beauty launches I'm very lucky
to get send lots of new stuff all the
time and often before they are coming
out in stores so I wanted to do a video
where I kind of review a lot of new
products that I've been trying I have a
terrible memory though so instead of
going um how much does this when's it
out I don't know I'm gonna leave a link
to everything down below I'm gonna put
what the product is how much is when
it's coming out where you can find it
now I've committed to that I actually
have to do it but I promise I will try
my best to put everything in the
description box so go and check that out
I've got a lot of products to talk
through so I'm just gonna get started
and the first thing is prom Charlotte
Tilbury now when I heard the shots
Hillary had kind of ventured into skin
care I was a bit I don't really like it
when makeup brands try and do skincare
as well so I'm never really sure of the
ingredients and just from past
experience I never really loved skincare
when it's from a makeup brand but the
Charlotte Tilbury makeup looks are
always very aimed towards kind of dry
skin making dry skin very jewy and glowy
so I wanted to give it a go because this
is her new goddess skin clay mask and I
mean the marketing the advertising
around this was great the video was very
appealing so I definitely wanted to try
it out it comes in this really nice kind
of like matte bottle that stands up
nicely on your little skincare shelf now
this is definitely a morning mask I
never normally use masks in the morning
I'm all about doing the face mask at
night before I go to bed I'm not a
morning person so I don't really have
time I hardly really do a pop skincare
routine I hardly ever really eat
breakfast
although okay so my granola video that's
all changed now so this is definitely a
morning mask because it kind of leaves
this hydrating feeling on your skin it's
not tacky but it definitely leaves
something on your skin you know some
masks like my ESOP one take off and you
just feel like you've got really clean
skin it's fresh this definitely leaves
some kind of residue on the skin but
it's nice and it's glowy and it works
really well under makeup it says on here
baby skin and I get what they mean by
that it really does make you feel like
you have baby skin it'll definitely be
too heavy for you if you have oily skin
eyes and even if you have normal skin I
feel like this is only good if you have
dry or dehydrated skin but it's
interesting I like that it's a morning
mask a bit different so yeah that's what
I think of the Charlotte Tilbury clay
mask tomforde have also released another
one of their illuminating primers I
absolutely love the original one which I
can't find the name for this
I don't know what it's called but it's
like a white illuminating primer and I
like to mix this with my foundation or
tinted moisturizer and put it all over
the skin and it's just as this
incredible glow it's like instant glow I
love it I've used it in a tutorial
before and they've now added this one
which is complexion enhancing primer oh
this one's illuminating primer in this
one's complexion enhancing primer this
one's more of a pinky tone so I would
not apply this all over my skin because
I like to stay away from pinky orange
skin but for me I like to just use it on
the tops of my cheekbones it's very very
pink though so I don't love it as much
as the original at all but I do still
like it and it's nice for the tops of
your cheekbones in the warmer months
very pink though so just a heads up the
next product I feel like I've spoken
about so much on Twitter on my vlogs
I've got it in a video coming up for my
monthly makeup routine which by the way
is this look so if you want to see how I
did this look that will be in my next
monthly makeup routine this is from YSL
and it's the less Sahara in less the
hurryin I don't how to say it the
sunkissed blur perfects a healthy glow
bomb powder now they released a bomb
Perfector primer thing recently which I
really didn't like I just didn't get it
it wasn't nice as a primer wasn't nice
as put on top of makeup like they said I
didn't like it but then they released
this and I'm obsessed I feel like this
would be like one of my favorite
all-time products that's how much I love
it basically a cream bronzer looks like
this it's like this amazing formula it's
smooth and silky and it kind of just
blends into your skin and gives you such
a healthy sunkissed look I like to apply
it to the tops of my cheekbones and to
my hairline and it's amazing on holiday
it's amazing when you're not on holiday
I've just I feel like I'm gonna go
through this whole thing I'm using it
every single day and I love it my mom
also bought one because she likes it so
much I'll show you how it comes in the
packaging it comes in this like gold box
cuz I have two this is a different shade
the shade I use by the way is number two
that's the one I use but they all seem
quite similar this one is number four
and it looks pretty similar to me so it
comes in this little black pouch and
that's the product and then with it is
this funny brush so this is what they
recommend you use it's like a sponge on
one end that's like quite flimsy and
then a brush which actually this is a
really nice soft brush on the other
personally I like using the Real
Techniques contour brush just it's like
like I would with a
cream blusher but I guess you can try
this for like this white thing will get
really grubby but I absolutely love that
cream bronzer it's amazing and I really
really like it do you think that bronzer
a little bit okay the next product is
from soap &amp;amp; Glory and I saw this in
Boots the other day so I want sort of
pick it up and give it a go is this it
let's not get this wrong sexy mother
pucker in a pillow plump lip gloss looks
like this comes in this box packaging
pretty big actually I got the shade pink
well which look like the most kind of
everyday pink looks like this yeah it's
a pretty long lip gloss actually and it
says extra extra large so the idea is
that it's limp lip plumping pop talked
today
what's in it that makes a lip plump it
says with glossy shine technology 3xl
peptide plump and lips well natural
flower oil infusion so it's one of those
lip glosses that makes her lips go all
tingly and is meant to make your lips
look more plump I already have quite
decent sized lips that way things today
but they're not particularly thin so I'm
probably not the best person to test
this but in terms of wearability I
didn't like this I don't I've just I've
never been into those kind of tingly
beasting lip things they kind of hurt
it's very tingly really intense I first
put it on a thought oh it's quite nice
it's not a bit like chocolate Oh smells
exactly like hot chocolate but then I
applied it and the tingling kicked in
and it was really intense I was kind of
like and my mom said your lips have
definitely got bigger that's like great
but it kind of hurts so if you have
really thin lips and you're desperate
you don't care if it hurts or whatever
then this is probably great but I didn't
really like the feeling and I just don't
if it's worth it I feel like if you use
a lip pencil and a lip gloss and a bit
of highlighter you can make your lips
look a bit more plump in ways that don't
hurt as much now I have a couple of
products that have new shades new
packaging I want to talk through this
one in particular I can't really review
because it doesn't work for my skin tone
but I really wanted to tell you guys
because I know that lots of different
people watch my videos so the original
Charlotte Tilbury bronze &amp;amp; Glow which my
packaging is broken and it doesn't
really close this is like one of my
favorite products it's contour and
highlights a beautiful like golden
champagne highlighter and a really nice
light brown contour that's not too grace
not to bronze
love
this loved it so much she's brought out
another shade which i think is so great
I think Charlotte Tilbury is really kind
of she really knows how to cater to all
different skin types she has all her
different looks and the different
lipsticks in anyway she's now released
this one which I don't know if it has a
different name or anything but it looks
like this so the bronze the contour
shade is a lot darker and the highlight
which is really interesting it's kind of
like a peachy golden highlight I think
this will work for much darker skin
tones it's far too dark for me but let
me know if you guys have tried this if
you have darker skin and what you think
of it because as I said I can't give a
review I just wanted to let you know
that this is out and I think it's really
great next up is a product that everyone
is talking about it's the San Tropez
gradual tan in shower I've had so many
people tweet me asking what I think of
this and I did a review on my blog so I
will link that down below if you want to
have a read but I can also tell you in
this video what I think of it the idea
of this is a gradual tanner that you put
on in the shower so the idea is great
because no one really likes applying
fake tan it's such a hassle so if it's
something you can do it in the shower
then great so the idea with this is that
you have your shower and then you turn
the shower off you apply this all over
your skin and you wait for three minutes
now there's quite a few problems with
that first of all you have to rinse your
hands after you've applied it so for me
if you have a big shower where you can
like stand to the side then that's great
but for me if I turn on the shower I get
wet so I'd kind of creep out the shower
and rinse my hands in the sink which is
all a bit cold second problem is that
how do you know when three minutes is up
I got sent this and it came with an egg
timer but I was thinking like you can't
buy that and still so I didn't use it I
left in my bedroom and I don't have a
clock in my shower until Anna mentioned
that she had a clock in the shower I
didn't even know that was like a thing
like she has a digital clock on the wall
didn't know you get those I don't have
any kind of time in the shower so the
only way I could think of knowing when
three minutes was up is by singing a
song because most pop songs are around
three minutes long so I sit in my shower
and sung ed Sheeran and thinking out
loud the top of my voice because I know
all the words that song by the time it
was over I was like okay that must be
about three minutes but I mean that's a
bit ridiculous I think you should come
with the egg timer that would be good
it's also a very slippy formula so I
wasn't sure that I was getting all of my
skin it was all a bit like slippy even
says in the packaging like the careful
don't slip in
shower because that's how slippery is
and I had Standish three minutes cold
singing like a widow so I don't know it
doesn't really work for me but in terms
of the actual products and how it works
I feel like this is quite good if you're
topping up a tan when I got back from
France I've been using this and it's
kind of just maintained my tan which is
nice but using this from nothing if I
was at my normal pale shade I feel like
this wouldn't work it's very very very
subtle which is fine if you have very
power skin and you're scared of fake tan
and try this because it's a good way to
like get into face hand it's very subtle
and natural but if you were hoping to
get a good tan out of this I feel like
you might be a bit disappointed because
it's that little bit too subtle I much
prefer the Express tan or so I had to
use so much product so I feel like you
will go through this quite quickly
anyway so many thoughts there but that
is what I think of the San Tropez tan
shower tan next up very quickly is the
soap &amp;amp; Glory solar powder they finally
changed the packaging I love when brands
listen to their customers the old
packaging was cardboard and very flimsy
mine actually didn't break a lot of
people said that there's broke mine's
still going strong so I will continue to
use this but they've made it into their
plastic packaging just like there are
the blushes and highlighters so so much
better with a mirror definitely less
likely to break only three more things
to go for I have released some blushes
and they're called aqua blush 12-hour
hold so these are like liquid blushes
they are very similar to the Giorgio
Armani blushing fabrics which were
released I think like two years ago now
it's like a cream blusher it's lightly
liquidy cream blusher that's quite thick
in texture a bit gel like and I really
like these for summer these are
particularly good if you're gonna be
sitting by the pool or on the beach I
like to just put on the back of my hand
and pass it on I'll use a contour brush
just to apply it to the cheekbones and I
find it to be really good and waterproof
and I think these are really good
affordable option but the blusher that I
am absolutely obsessed with is from
Stila I've got this from cult Beauty
when I last made an order and this is
their aqua glow watercolour blush and I
was a short shade to get but I went for
shimmering Lotus because it's a pink
with gold shimmer yes it is as amazing
as it sounds it's a proper proper liquid
though it's not like the other brushes
which are like a gel this is a liquid so
I only ever use products from the lid
I don't think I'll ever make my way
through this cuz I didn't even touch
that I just take a tiny tiny wincy bit
from the lid you hardly need anything
and I just Pat it on my cheeks and I
like to take this as well quite up high
onto the cheekbones because it has that
gold shimmer in it it's like a really
nice highlighter as well and oh my god
it's gorgeous I just want everyone to
buy this you know you find a product and
you're like buy it it's so good I also
want to try some of the other shades I
might buy some when I'm in LA this is so
nice though it's got this amazing gold
shimmer in it so so pretty okay and then
finally an eyeshadow palette from Laura
Mercier last year or maybe the year
before I got her artist palette which
looked like this and I loved her artist
palette so there's a hair in there
because they have so many great shades
in there and the quality of our shadows
are really really nice so I really
enjoyed using this one but there were a
couple of shades I didn't use like the
purple glitter there's a black and a
navy and there's one called diamond pink
which is a bit too light for me so she's
just released or maybe it's coming out
remember the new artist palette which
looks like this comes in this packaging
let me take it out for you and it has
this kind of lace detail cover and flips
up like her other palettes and this one
is amazing I do think this one is better
for me because it has more shades that I
will use I think I'll use every single
shade there's one called vanilla nuts
which is like a nice bone color for all
over your lid and sparkling G which is
like a highlighter shade and then the
rest are all very kind of pale pink Mac
all that glitters there's one called
African violet which is like a purple
with gold shimmer that is beautiful
fresco is a great crease shade bamboos
probably my favorite shade from the
palette is a bit like Mac patina like a
cool toned gold that's beautiful
plum smoke a lovely lilac for the crease
and matte shade and there's there's more
nice purples and browns and expresso
beam as the darkest color which is a
grey so there's no like black because I
would never use a black eyeshadow
there's no like weird blues or anything
like that for brown eyed girls I think
this is a beautiful palette and I will
definitely get use out of all these
shades so there's all the products that
I've been trialing and I really hope my
mini reviews have helped you guys don't
forget to check the description box for
prices where you can get them and when
they're coming out thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
