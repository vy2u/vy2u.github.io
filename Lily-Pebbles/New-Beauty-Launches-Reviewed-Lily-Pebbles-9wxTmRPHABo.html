Beauty launches out at the moment I
thought in today's video I'd give some
of them a go and show you guys what I
think now I promise I didn't mean to
upload the same videos Anna did on
Sunday sometimes that just happens but I
actually think it's a good thing because
I'm gonna link her video down below and
you can see what she thinks of all the
new Beauty launches she mentioned and
I'm actually talking about completely
different products in mine apart from
one that we have the same there's so
many new products out so I really think
these sort of videos are quite important
for us to kind of wade through all the
marketing fluff and show you guys just
our honest opinion on what we think of
the products and how they work my memory
is terrible so instead of talking about
prices and shade range I'm gonna list
everything below I'm gonna put the
product details when it's coming out or
if it's out already and how much it's
gonna be so don't forget check down in
the description box for all the details
it's gonna be a long one the first
product I'm going to talk about is the
new NARS foundation I've had a lot of
tweets and a lot of questions about this
and I've been giving it a go
for a little bit now it's called the all
day luminous weightless foundation NARS
love their long names they also tend to
name things I think slightly wrong like
the shade glow foundation it's really
not that sheer but this one I thought
was really interesting one because it
comes with a pump which is quite rare
for NARS foundation so I remember when I
bought shake glow it took me a long time
to hunt down a pump for five pounds and
spacing K and I was a little bit of
noise so I'm happy this one comes with a
pump I'm a mix of two shades earner
Deauville and Fiji I'm somewhere in
between so I'm going to use both today
and kind of talk you through what I
think of it so far as I'm applying it so
I think this foundation sits somewhere
between one of those kind of oil serum
foundations and just a normal liquid
foundation I find it really easy to
blend in I think when you're blending it
in it kind of sinks into the skin very
quickly and sort of disappears compared
to the sheer glow which I find I spend
quite a long time blending that one in
this definitely has a more matte finish
though it says it's luminous I actually
don't find it as glowy as Shea glow I
have quite dry dehydrated skin at the
moment actually I have really bad skin
from all the fly and I've got like a bit
of a rash here and I do find that this
foundation clings to my dry patches
there's something about it that I find
kind of just sits on top of the skin but
I don't think it's terrible when I look
in the mirror
I think my skin does look quite nice but
when I look close up I feel like you can
sort of see my pores and it just looks a
little bit dry on my skin so maybe for
oily skin type this foundation might be
nicer but I'm definitely more of a fan
of the sheer glow foundation I just feel
like it's kind of lighter on the skin
more glowy it has a fresher finish this
one to me is a little bit heavier but I
do find that this foundation lasts
really well throughout the day when I
look at my skin at the end of the day it
looks the same as it is in in the
morning whereas I don't find Shea glow
lasts as long you definitely don't need
much at this foundation though you saw
half a pump but I've still got quite a
lot left on my hand so the formula is
very long-lasting and it's slightly more
matte than Shea glow so if you have sort
of combination oily skin I think you
might like this but for me I'm
definitely more a fan of the sheer glow
foundation ok the next product I'm going
to talk through is the new Urban Decay
Naked skin concealer I use this and
might get ready with me video I had
quite a few questions about it I'm a big
fan of this concealer this for me lives
up to my favorite nas creamy radiant
concealer I love the applicator it's so
long and bendy sorry that you can really
get over kind of large areas if you'd
like to apply concealer on your cheeks
it's really easy if I show you on my
chin well I've got a huge spot there you
can just use the flat side of the brush
and it's so easy to apply I really love
the applicator the formula is very
creamy it's very easy to blend and once
it is blended in it looks very natural
you can't kind of see it sitting on the
skin I also think it's got really decent
coverage so you can use it on spots and
blemishes I think this might even be
better than the NARS one I love my NARS
one so much I kind of feel bad saying
that I feel like a traitor I'm just
gonna blend this in with my Real
Techniques setting brush which is the
one I always use for concealer I always
put too much of this concealer on I
literally have far too much concealer on
because the applicator is quite large
and I'm used to the NARS one I find that
I always put too much on so Saints bear
in mind there is quite a lot of product
on the one so be careful not to over
apply like I have done by the way the
look that I'm creating today is
gonna be nice because it's not really
about the overall look it's about trying
each individual product and just telling
you I think I'm just blending that's
concealer and taking it slightly out of
my lid I'm actually gonna take my
foundation brush and just buff that
ruling because I did apply a bit too
much now I put my concealer and I feel
like you can see the foundation doesn't
really suit my skin I just look like I'm
wearing too much makeup compared to I
usually wear areas like this I find just
look a little bit dry and it looks like
I've got pores I don't really usually
have it just tends to kind of cling to
areas like here and here but anyway I'm
gonna carry on and the next product I'm
using is actually in my hand this is
from Kiko and it's part of their new
collection and it's a really gorgeous
bronzer it is called masterpiece bronzer
in 0/1 forward to Sienna it's got three
different shades in it like a light
medium and a dark and it's just I love
this one actually it's really smooth
like to swing my brush around I'm gonna
use this not like how I usually do to
contour more as like a sun-kissed look
over the tops of my cheekbones
that's not my cheekbones well these
could the tops of my like temples and
over my cheekbones and over my nose so
it gives more of like a summer sunkissed
look this products really soft I know
that sounds weird but it feels soft when
you apply it it's just a really nice
kind of blended product
I love Kiko I hardly ever try and think
that I don't like so if you are looking
for a new bronzer a lot of people said
that solar powders sold out so I would
recommend this one as well I think it's
really nice actually and not too
different to cellular powder probably a
little bit softer and lighter but it's
not kind of orange it's just leave some
really nice bronze and next I'm going to
talk about brushes I think I've
mentioned these before I am in love with
them they're from Max Factor and it's
their new blushes that are called
creme puff blush they come in six shades
and I've already done a blog post on
these because I think they are such a
good dupe for the hourglass ambient
lighting blush I do find these a little
bit more shimmery sparkly when you are
in direct sunlight you can look a little
bit sparkly but they're really really
pretty much shader menus I'm going to
use gorgeous berries they're baked and
they have that kind of swirly
highlighter looks you can use these as a
blush and a highlighter
it kind up on the tops of your
cheekbones this one's quite a dark
shades I'm going to take a little bit
and just apply it kind of to the tops of
my cheekbones these are so pretty I
think they're really good value for
money very similar to the hourglass ones
very pretty for spring/summer I'm just
going to take the product off my brush
and blend that in a bit I really like
this I always find it hard to decide
which color to wear in the morning but
I've been using these a lot this month I
think these are also quite similar to
the Milani blushes if you're in the UK
and you can't get Milani cuz I think
it's an American brand is also quite
similar they have that baked swirly feel
to them or I forgot to mention I have
these two products here I was gonna say
about the foundation that I also tried
using it with like a hydrating base with
the Charlotte Tilbury magic cream or
recently also tried this from Yves long
which is the flawless radiance SPF 30
and I found that when I put on a really
hydrating base first the foundation went
on better and had more of like hydrated
glowy finish so I feel like you can and
pop the hydration but I wanted to apply
it without this just you could see what
it look like by itself okay I just
quickly filled in my brows a bit and
next I'm gonna talk about eyes these are
new from Bourjois and they are the color
band eyeshadow and liners so these are
cream eyeshadows I wouldn't probably use
these aligners because they're quite
kind of big I think these are really
nice just as cream eyeshadows I have
four shades here rose oh god is it all
gonna be French Rose fauvist
oh I'm not even gonna attempt god
they're really difficult names I'm just
gonna list below what the names are I am
NOT gonna ruin French for everybody I
really like these and I've tried them
out a couple of times so far they have
increased on me I think unless you kind
of really load them up they don't crease
I think if you put too much on them
lights but if you really blend it out
they're really nice I'm going to use a
couple of shades I can't decide which
one the one Mobarak I think it's quite
similar to mysterious a bit more purple
but it's got that really nice kind of
silver shimmer in it that gives you that
wet look on the lid there's a really
nice kind of pale gold and a pale pink
that's a bit like all the glitters and
then a dark brown think I'm going to use
the pale pink and the brown together so
I'm going to start with the shade 0 4
and just take that all over the lid it's
a really like chunky crayon so you can
completely drawn this is also similar to
that Kiko eyeshadow that I always talk
about so you can apply it and then you
can use your finger to blend it out you
can use a brush but I think for the
lighter colors it's really easy to just
use your finger I think they're quite
subtle nothing too drastic you probably
can layer it up but just for like a
sheer wash of color I think it's really
pretty
very subtle I'm going to use the brown
shade in 0-2 on the outer parts of the
eye and these are quite easy to blend
together so you can use more than one
shade I'm just gonna apply that to the
outer part of the eye and then I'm going
to use a blending brush just to blend
that in there very soft easy to blend
and have really nice kind of metallic
shimmer to them I think that's really
pretty
as I said it's quite subtle anything is
there life changing they're definitely
not like the by Terry Umbra black stars
but for kind of drugstore prices these
are really nice and they're great if you
do your makeup on the train as well
because they're very easy you don't need
to use a brush you can just use your
finger I'm impressed with this the
quality feels really nice and they do
last on the lid I tried them yesterday
all day and it did last these are nice
for school or if you don't like to wear
too much makeup to work very easy and I
think I prefer them to Rimmel i shadow
Koreans actually I definitely do not
gonna put any liner on but I'm gonna go
in for mascara now and this is a pretty
exciting launch I've seen a lot of hype
about this product
it's from benefit and it's their roller
lash benefit always do mascara is very
big it's always a very big launch I
wasn't a fan of their real at all even
though it's apparently the UK's number
one bestseller mascara I've never been a
fan I like the packaging the top is
rubberized and I think it's meant to
look like a hair roller but it's
actually even though it's kind of just
you know packaging and it looks pretty I
actually think it's quite nice to grip
and it's got a good grip to it the wand
is like one of those kind of plastic
ones that there are finer bristles so
with these sort of ones always like to
really take my time to comb through the
lashes so I'm just gonna apply it to the
lashes sort of twisting the wand as I
apply going right from the root and just
lifting the lashes up I think this
mascara gives amazing link like sky-high
lashes seriously very very long to find
I don't find that it's the best for
volume which is usually something that I
quite like in a mascara
I like having quite full thick lashes so
it doesn't really do the volume thing
there's no denying it doesn't Inc I
haven't actually cut used a car lot of
my lashes I feel like it does give a
really good car I think that's quite a
dramatic difference actually and that's
only with a couple of kind of layers
this is probably one of the best benefit
mascara that I've tried and definitely
beets they're real for me so it
definitely gives length and definition
not so much volume but if it's length
you're after and curl well done benefit
this products actually worth the hype
okay we're onto the final product and
this is new from YSL I mentioned the
Clarins lip oil in my January favourites
and it was the first kind of lip oil
that I've tried but I knew that it was
going to become a thing once one brand
does it everyone kind of follows and I
think it makes sense having an oil for
your lips oils are very hydrating and
nourishing and why I'll have gone that
one step further and made a tinted oil
this is kind of strange but it comes in
loads of different shades it has their
kind of signature applicator so I'll
show you when you apply it there is no
doubt it feels like an oil it has their
signature very fruity melon scented
fragrance so if you're not a fan of
sweet fruity scents you won't like this
it's quite overwhelming but I quite like
it as you can see when I apply it it is
tinted and the shades sorts of really
comes out as you apply it it gets
brighter or darker it does feel quite
slippy and oily and I'm not sure I'm a
massive fan of the texture of it I
immediately feel like I want to go and
blot it with a tissue but I find after a
couple of hours the oil layer sort of
disappears and you're left with a tint
which i think is the whole idea and I do
quite like it I like the whole tint to
the lips thing
it feels very moisturizing I just I'm
not sure if I'm a big fan of the
oiliness
of it which I could tell you the shade
of this one but the number on the bottom
is just so tiny I can't see it but it's
quite a bright pink I think it's pretty
I think a lot of people will like it
because it does really hydrate the lips
it's kind of a nice alternative to lip
gloss but I think when I wear it I'd
apply it built it with a tissue and then
just kind of leave the stain I sure I'm
gonna go get a tissue so I could show
you what it looks like okay so I blot it
it kind of takes off that oily layer and
then you're left with a tint I
kind of like that but I'm sure that's
not the kind of purpose of it and
probably not a reason to buy it because
they do just hints but I think once the
oil layer kind of disappears it is a
really nice lip tint and it will
probably be really nice for spring and
summer months so those all the new
Beauty launches that I wanted to talk
