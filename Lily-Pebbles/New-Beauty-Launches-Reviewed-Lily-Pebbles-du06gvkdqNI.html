talking through some new Beauty launches
I know that the beauty industry can be
incredibly overwhelming there's always
new products launching and I thought it
would be really helpful if I just sat
down went through some of them told you
my honest opinion which ones I would
recommend which ones not so much and
just kind of chat with you about some
new Beauty stuff this time of year
there's always so much coming out
especially just before Christmas time so
here's a little breakdown of some of the
stuff that I've been testing out
recently
okay so first up are the new lipsticks
from Maybelline these are called the
creamy mattes
they're $6.99 each and you can get them
in Boots Superdrug or whatever kind of
local drugstore shock you have the idea
as the name suggests is a matte lipstick
that's hydrating and creamy I'm actually
wearing one now the one I'm wearing is
called
divine wine it was a real struggle to
find the shade this was like the sell
out one from the collection the other
shade that I have is siren in scarlet
which is a kind of standard red oops so
these are the two lipsticks and I really
like them I really like the way they
feel on the lips very light it's the
sort of lips that you'll forget you're
wearing after about 10 minutes I can't
feel it on the lips at all is not drying
or heavy so I really love the texture of
them but because you're sacrificing that
really matte kind of drying texture
they're definitely not as long-lasting
as a traditional matte as maybe the
Charlotte Tilbury matte lipsticks I can
feel that it's the sort of lipstick that
might wear off when I start eating or
drinking and the edges could easily be
smudged if I kind of swiped it with my
hand so maybe this isn't the lipstick
that I would wear if I had a really long
night out or an event or anything like
that but if you want to experiment with
a matte lipstick you've never really
tried one before this is a good one to
try because it's not so like oh my god
that's really drying and matte it's very
comfortable and these two shades the
only ones from the collection that I
really liked the red and the kind of
dark burgundy so for $6.99 I'd say they
were worth trying just don't be upset if
it doesn't last all day like a normal
matte lipstick would there's also a new
launch from collab collab is my friend
Ruth's brand
I love Ruth she's just my favorite
person ever this you can get in
superdrug and they launched with dry
shampoos but since then they've done a
texturizing I think
volumizing spray and now they've
launched this which is the glossing hair
fragrance so the idea of this is it's
infused with diamond silk and precious
oils so ad moistures a bit like a dry
conditioner and it will also add a
really nice scent to your hair put some
one now it just is like a hairspray it
does add a little bit of hold as well
there is a little bit of texture in
there which I like for my hair smells
nice like it's quite like a fresh linen
e scent it says there's got like shimmer
in there which normally that would
really scare me but it's not like
shimmer that's that noticeable it's just
a reading that's kind of glossy finish
that it gives them the hair so I really
like that and I like the coloring of the
packaging it's a bit like obey maybe a
nonessential but it's really bad to
spray perfume on your hair's not good
for your actual hair so if you do like
to have a scent in your hair but when
you like rush past someone and they
think oh she smells nice then go for a
hair perfume like this instead and it's
only $4.99 you guys know how much I love
the hourglass ambient lighting powders
and ambient lighting blushes wasn't a
massive fan of the bronzers but I really
like the whole range in general and
hourglass have recently launched this
palette which everyone's been going a
bit wild for online it's I think coming
out for Christmas is already out but
it's like their Christmas gifting
collection and it's got six powders in
it now I've seen some really mixed
reviews online some people are
complaining that it's too small that the
kind of pans are too small to use I
personally think it's a great size
because if a pallet is too big I just
don't know when I would use it or as
this you can kind of take away with you
and it's not too large I think that's
pretty big already the whole palette is
65 pounds which is a lot of money but
their pallets that are a lot more than
that and I think for this that's kind of
a good price is what I would expect it
to be only one of the powders is new
they do have some of my favorites though
mood exposure which is my favorite blush
favorite really can't say that word this
one in the middle is luminous flush
which I didn't have already it's quite a
bright pink not sure that's my fave but
they're good to to have in here and then
they've got the light bronzer I don't
love the bronzer but if I was pick out
the - that's a good ones having a pal
and then the powder stat the top they've
got dim light which is my favorite
setting powder it's like a slightly
yellowy powder so I always use that to
set my concealer and that's the one I
use pretty much every day and then the
one in the middle is the new one which
is iridescent light and it's like a
pinky shimmer not massive fan of pink
shimmers but that would be nice for like
tops of the cheekbones and then the one
on the far right is diffused light which
is a really nice and my kidneys are
right way around I think I just got
those switched around oh yeah diffused
light is the one I use every day dim
light is a slightly more bronzy one it's
like slightly peachy anyway I think is a
really good selection they put in there
I think is a really nice gift I think
the price point is what I would expect
for this and they're great powders so
for me I think it's a good one
okay the next launch is from benefit and
you guys know I'm not a fan of the
they're real mascara so whenever there's
a new launch from the their real range I
know that's probably not gonna be for me
because mascara is a very personal thing
and I can made the work for you or they
don't and they're real just didn't
really work for me but it's the UK
number one best-selling mascara so
clearly a lot of people love it so I
thought I'd put this in for you guys
this is the tinted primer Estee Lauder
launched the little black primer early
on in the year and that was the kind of
first and SCARA primer that I'd seen the
idea is that you apply it before your
mascara and it Prime's your lashes ready
for the mascara giving extra length and
volume so benefits jobs on the bandwagon
and they've done their own tinted primer
it comes in brown and yeah it didn't
really work for me from honest but if
you're a fan of their real it will
probably work for you and it will
probably go really nicely with the
mascara but for me I just feel like it
didn't really add anything to the lashes
and it kind of separated them in a funny
way I really like s they lured a little
black primer it's also really nice it's
just an everyday kind of very subtle
mascara but for me this one isn't really
something that I would purchase this
launch I found really really exciting
I've been a fan of the Bobbi Brown
corrector and concealers for so many
years they're little creamy pots the
corrector are like peachy salmony tones
to cancel out the dark purple and blues
under your eye and then the concealers
like a traditional concealer I've always
been more found at the corrector and
then I've used my own concealer but
either way it's like a Bobbi Brown
bestseller and they've recently lon
assirram version which i think is a
great idea because the creams can be a
little bit fiddly they can be a little
bit too creamy I feel like as much as I
love them I never end up using them
daily because I don't really like to use
my hands and it's quite hard to use with
a brush so now they force out these and
I think they're fantastic I never used
the word fantastic fantastic I didn't
always like that they come with all the
dough for applicators which is so much
easier to use and also the package is
really small so that's good I haven't
got the exact color match for me so it's
been quite hard to test it but I tested
it out just knowing that the colors
wouldn't be right more for the formula
and I really like them it's slightly
more of a serum texture so if you have
oily skin it might be a bit too slippy
for you but I've got a really kind of
dry skin especially under my eyes so for
me it was really hydrating and really
nice I just apply it straight with the
dopher and then if you use my finger to
dab it in or use a brush to blend it in
and you put the corrector first to get
rid of the dark circles and then you use
the concealer on top and I love the
formula there are so many colours I
think there are about 16 or 17 shades in
each one so if you go to a counter
they'll color match you specific to your
skintone and depending on what sort of
dark circles you have but I think this
is a great launch and they are a bit
more expensive than the cream characters
and concealers these are 28 pounds each
and the creamy ones were 19 pounds each
but I think for the better packaging and
the better formula is definitely worth
the extra money so I'm gonna go and get
the correct color for me because I've
got 7 knees and they don't quite suit me
because I think they're really great as
you guys know I really love the Sunday
Riley lunar oil which is the blue one I
use it at night especially when my skin
is playing up and it just soothes my
skin and sorts it out it's like a magic
oil I don't even know how it does it but
it's brilliant and they recently
launched a new cleanser that's very
similar to the lunar oil I had a sample
pot for about a month I was testing out
and they just blow out the full size so
I thought I would test it for a good few
months and then let you know what I
think so this one hasn't been used much
but I've used the sample up completely
so it's called the blue moon tranquility
cleansing balm and it's blue because it
used blue tanzy like the lunar oil and
it also uses cocoa butter which you
really smell it smells like chocolate
which sounds amazing but personally I
don't love the scent I don't know why I
don't really like the scent of cocoa and
it's not really something I want to put
on my face when it comes to skincare I'd
obviously prefer to have no scent but if
it's gonna have a certain that I like
kind of the spa essential oils lavender
scented things that are really relaxing
this for me is just a little bit too
sickly not a fan of the scent the
cleanser it cleansed my skin well and
took off makeup well but for a bomb I
can only compare it to the bombs that I
have in like which are their Emma Hardy
cleansing balm and what are the bombs
that I liked
well the renascence cleansing gel is
more of a gel oil so compared to the
Emma Hardy I found that this instead of
going from a bomb to an oil it's sort of
crumbles you can kind of see in here
that it's quite crumbly and I found let
me just close this
I found that I when I was robbing it
onto my skin it was kind of just
crumbling and I'm not sure if I enjoyed
that texture on my skin I would prefer
to be smoother and Tenant in oil I can
really work into the skin so for me it
wasn't quite perfect I'm not really sure
it's something that I would continue to
use I prefer to buy the emma hardy
cleansing balm or the osteo renaissance
cleansing gel but I do still love the
lunar oil so I don't know maybe I know
some people love this it's just wasn't
quite for me oh and this costs 46 pounds
and you get 100 grams this launch is
really really interesting it's from RMS
and it's the ultimate makeup remover
wipes you guys know that I don't really
tend to use wipes I only really use them
on aeroplanes or when I'm campaign I
don't even really use them when I'm
being lazy at home because I use just a
cotton pad and my sila water you get 20
wipes in a box and the Box cost 12
pounds so let me show you open the box
each wipe is individually wrapped in
silver foil I don't think this is very
economically friendly but apart from
that I will just talk about the wipes
and what they're like so they're coconut
oil wipes as far as I'm aware that's all
that in them is just coconut oil which
is really nice it's oh it says 100%
eco-friendly noted safe to use on eyes
get a right for blemish prone skin melts
away I make up all of that stuff so I
you know you've heard before about using
coconut oil to remove makeup but it
get a bit messy in a bit grubby and it
feels a bit weird so they've kind of
made it easier to remove your makeup
with coconut oil because in a white form
I wanted to try this because they sound
really different and interesting and I
think these are like the future of
makeup wipes because if you buy like the
simple skincare wipes they're quite wet
aren't they whereas these are completely
dry so we're going to fill the white
they're dry but a remove makeup so
incredibly well and quickly
I bought a range of eyeliners here with
me so I'm gonna demonstrate on my hand
I'll waste a wipe sacrifice it for the
video
okay so tomforde liquid eyeliner let's
put on put on my Kat Von D tattoo liner
feel like I'm doing an eyeliner testing
video part eyeliner that's more of like
a creamy one and a L'Oreal black liquid
eyeliner ok so put all those at my hands
I'm just gonna let them dry for a bit so
you just rip open the packet and it's
all folded up and as I said it's like
dry it's so weird
feel slightly greasy but not wet so it
opens to that big it's very little and
let me see so that's my hand one wipe
two wipes if I actually went for it
pretty much removes it's not a one white
wonder but the eyeliners pretty much
gone there and you can see it's kind of
gone onto the wipe you can be very
gentle with it and I don't know you
probably can't see my hand from there
but my hands kind of like but Rhys my so
coconut oil I don't love the smell of
coconut oil rich always cooks with it it
kind of goes moisturizing a little bit
greasy a very little bit greasy so
they're obviously more expensive than
normal face size but if you're only
using them occasionally on flights like
me then I think is better to use
something like this on your skin so much
better it doesn't strip your skin and
takes up and takes off makeup faster so
yeah really interesting definitely the
future of face wipes right there
okay I've left this next launch to last
because I know that I'm gonna get so
much stick because the prices of these
products were crazy I was very lucky and
I'll send the whole range to try and
when I first got them I thought you know
this is a new brand I've never heard
wasn't really that excited because I
didn't know much about it so I didn't
really look into it much and I just
tried the products and I thought I'll
let them speak for themselves and oh my
god I can't even explain to you how
incredible these products are I don't
know what I'm gonna do when I finish
them I'm actually a bit panicky about it
because they're so amazing this is
exclusively pretty much a part of my
Askia cleanser all like used for about
three weeks now they are brilliant so
the brand is called I don't know how you
pronounce it whether it's and it's kite
press or kick press I'm not sure but
it's all like vegan friendly organic
natural I mean I will link down below
their website because there was a list
of all the things that it is but
everything you can imagine pretty much
is that and they come in these little
glass bottles with the pipette so
there's quite a few products and the
prices are insane they're so expensive
but the reason I want to dimension them
is because everyone has a different
budget some people prefer to spend very
little money on skincare but there are
definitely people who like to spend a
lot of money on skincare so for those
people I thought I would let you know
about these products - so the blue
bottles I have a few of the blue bottles
there's antioxidant jus which says
quench and glow and I use that in the
morning that's like a milky white serum
and that is really nice the hydration
and glow in the morning there's also
moonlight catalyst which is refine and
renew this is a great one to use in the
evening this one has retinoids in it and
it's really great great for like
clearing the skin and I put this on in
the evening so if you can hear the
lawnmower thing outside it's very
annoying I put this on an evening woke
up in the morning my skin was just like
new skin it literally felt like new skin
and it felt incredible so I using that a
lot in the evening I use that instead of
the lunar oil or I kind of alternate and
then there's also clearing serum which
says balanced and calm this one I would
use if I had spotty skin and it's
slightly like sting II but I love this
one all kinds of ingredients in it I'm
gonna list them below and you guys can
look into it if you want I won't bore
you with the ingredients list and then
there are the oils and they've got three
different types of oils one two or three
they come in either fourteen milliliter
bottles which are quite tiny or the 47
milliliter bottles but 14 millilitres
are 70 pounds and the 50ml
up to 175 pounds for a face oil
absolutely crazy but you know I'm gonna
say the best face all I've ever tried
amazing
there's I've only got one and two so I
don't know what three is like but beauty
elixir one so it says it's got a
thousand roses in it which why is which
is why it's so expensive whenever
products expensive because they're like
either handmade or they've got like
crazy expensive ingredients in it this
one I don't love the smell it smells a
bit like Indian food that's what I'm
getting from it or like celery or
something like that if the oil feels
incredible on your skin I'm obsessed to
this I mean using it every night but I
think I refer the scent of the beauty
elixir too which is a bit more like spar
like it's got definitely got lavender or
something in it it smells really really
nice I prefer the smell of two but both
of them the oils I've never tried a face
oil like it it just feels so great on
the skin I'm not gonna bang on about
this I think the whole range is
incredible I love the products I don't
know what I'm gonna do when I run out
because they're amazing I'm gonna want
to repurchase them straightaway but if
you'd like to spend that much money on
your skincare go and check out the range
I think at the moment it's exclusive to
Selfridges I know there's a little stand
there in the Beauty totten because I
went there recently so go and check it
out if you would like to okay so those
are all the new launches that I'm going
to talk through today I hope that was
helpful to some of you maybe now you can
add some things to your Christmas
wishlist or cross off some things that
you kind of put interested in buying but
maybe now you don't want to I just
wanted to sit and give you guys an
honest review of some of the products
that I've been trying recently so thank
you so much for watching and I will see
you on Tuesday for my next weekly vlog
