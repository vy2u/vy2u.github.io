every day mate today's video is going to
be a casual chatty makeup tutorial where
I'm showing lots of new products whether
it's products I've been sent or some of
the stuff I bought in New York that you
would have seen in my haul video if you
haven't seen the beauty haul that I did
from New York go check it out I'll put a
little eye button here so I'm gonna stop
rambling and get straight into it and
just talk through the products as I'm
applying them just like we're just
sitting and doing our makeup together
because I kind of love watching these
videos so I hope you guys do too I'm
gonna start with the Tarte rainforest of
the sea foundation that I picked up in
Sephora it's a water-based foundation so
it's obviously quite watery I got the
shade light sand and I'm gonna shake it
up because I was actually their watery
foundations I've used this a couple of
times and I really like it I find it a
little bit messy because of the
applicator and how to put on the back of
my hand and then apply it on to where I
want the coverage smells very like
fruity and fresh it smells a bit like
Chanel foundations actually and then I'm
gonna use my Real Techniques complexion
sponge I am still using the artist
brushes but I still don't feel confident
enough to kind of use them easily in a
video I wanted the focus of this video
to be more about the products so I'm
just going to bounce that all over the
skin I've made the sponge quite quite
damp because I like how it kind of goes
with the watery foundation on first
application it's very very light and
quite sheer but you can definitely build
it up I'm just gonna keep kind of
bopping this all over the skin I haven't
got great skin at the moment because of
all the flying I'm just more spotty than
I usually am and a bit more dry as well
just gonna take a bit more of that so
now I kind of got it all over my hand
and it's definitely more messy than I
would like I think it looks really fresh
on the skin though which is why I really
like this foundation definitely gonna
continue to use it so that's the
foundations done a nice light to medium
coverage and then I like to use my Urban
Decay Naked concealer I'm not using a
new concealer today because I just love
this one it's got such good coverage
that I feel like I can wear a lighter
foundation and then just use this where
I need a bit of extra coverage this is
the light light neutral shade I'm using
quite a bit of concealer these days and
then I'm going to use the sponge again
just to pop that into play
I like tick under my eye and also on top
of the lid as well just to neutralize it
cuz I've quite dark eyelids then I'm
going to use this which is new from
redial I got sent this yesterday and
it's their banana powder and I've never
tried a banana powder before but they're
really nice because it's a yellow
setting powder so it's nice for
brightening I'm just gonna take a little
bit and apply that under the eye to kind
of set my concealer it's a nice light
powder definitely doesn't come out
yellow on the skin so nothing to be
afraid of I don't know how much that did
but I probably know later in the day
whether that set my concealer or not
because an orange bronzed up the skin
and I've greens contour separately just
so I can show you two different products
this one is the butter bronzer from
Physicians Formula I think it was Amelia
someone convinced me to get this when I
was in CVS in New York
I didn't realize though that it smells
so strong after I put the whole video a
lot of you guys commented saying wait
till you smell the bronzer it smells
like full-on like old school Sun cream
like sort of sungkoo your parents put on
you and you're a kid smells like holiday
like coconuts at first I loved it but
it's actually really quite overpowering
and I feel I find that when you put it
on the skin you can still smell it and
I'm not sure that's something I love I
also think it worries me that it's gonna
break me out because something that's so
heavily scented I feel like it could
just end up making you spotty but I'm
gonna apply it to show you guys what it
looks like just very lightly
it is a nice bronzer it does have a very
buttery formula to it I faked and last
night so I don't need too much bronzing
which is nice it's not showing up that
much on camera so I'll put a little bit
more so my thoughts on that that I like
the bronzer and formula but not so sure
on the heavy scent I'm also gonna do it
if contouring using the Kat Von D shade
and light palette I picked up I knew
that I wouldn't get that much use out of
the highlight shades at the top someone
said that this middle one is quite good
for setting your concealer so I might
try that one day but I think for now I'm
gonna take the lightest most ashy shade
and just add a little bit of definition
it's a very nice
powder it's very soft and I find it a
little bit easier to wear them the Kevyn
Aucoin one so we're gonna leave that
there I'm happy that I got this palette
because I think the contour shades are
really good and I'm gonna go back to
this later on to do a bit of my eye
shadow as well I'm just gonna quickly
fill in my brows you guys have seen this
a million times before I'm using the
Delilah brow liner for a little bit of
highlight I'm going to use my Anastasia
Beverly Hills glow kit I'm so glad I got
this and I'm gutted I didn't get the
other one so funny
if you know the whole story I think I'm
interested in my whole video but this
one has hard candy mimosa starburst and
crushed pearl it slightly more pink than
the other one I think I would have
preferred the more yellowy palette but
crushed pearl is beautiful I actually
kind of mix them I think today I'm gonna
mix hard candy and crushed pearl and
I've been using the morphe Emma 501
brush which is really nice it's like a
huge eyeshadow brush but it's nice for
highlight I really like it I'm just
gonna dab it in the formula of these is
insane so you really do need a tiny
amount and you can really see it on the
skin cuz a lot of highlighters just
don't show up for me so I'm just gonna
apply that to the tops of the cheekbones
blend it out hope that you can see this
on camera that banana powder definitely
hasn't stopped my concealer from
creasing I have such Creasy eyes I'm
gonna take a tiny bit of highlighter
just up here cuz I think that it's quite
pretty I don't mind looking sweaty that
is my aim and if it's the other side
tiny bit on my nose just what's left on
the brush and it's a bit on my Cupid's
bow I think it's very easy to go
overboard so I'm gonna stop there I
think that looks really pretty for my
eyes I'm going to use the Anastasia
Beverly Hills eyes shadow so I made a
little quad in Sephora there's a lot of
fallout on these eyeshadows it's made
quite a bit of a mess but they're really
really nice I'm going to use the lighter
shade that I got and they're seriously
pigmented look at that I took the
tiniest amount of my brush so so pretty
I went through three shimmer shades and
one matte because the shimmers when I
just swatch them they felt amazing they
take the slightly pinkish shade which
looks a bit like Mac all the glitters I
try and remember the shade names I have
a
look underneath and then I'll link all
the products I'm talking about below in
the description box then I'm going to
take this shade which is a kind of matte
line look which is a bit different but I
think it's really nice in the crease and
the outer part of the eye and now what
I'm going to do is go back to the Kat
Von D contour palette and I think I'll
take the middle shade just like a medium
matte brown and take that in the crease
just to warm it up a little bit then I'm
also gonna take that same brown
underneath the eye I forgot to bring
eyeliner with me so this isn't ideal
because it's quite big brush but I'm
gonna try and take a little bit of the
dark contour Brown just run it along the
eye the top lash line wait I forgot
mascara as well I'm gonna have to come
back okay I'm gonna do the same on the
other eye but now I've got my eyeline
I'm gonna put bit of that one as well
it's just Mac groundbreaker I have used
this eyeliner every day since I bought
it
absolutely brilliant I'm gonna put that
very close to the lash line I feel a bit
naked without Bryant Brown eyeliner for
my mascara I'm gonna use Charlotte's
Hilary's new mascara which is legendary
lashes but also just realized I have to
put blusher on yet this is because I
haven't filmed like a sit-down proper
video in ages because I've been away so
this all feels very strange to me this
mascara is unreal
look at that that was like two strokes
it's a very wet formula so it's a sort
of mascara that you don't want to sneeze
until it dries but it gives amazing
lashes I really like it I didn't like
her original mascara so I'm happy she's
brought out this one now it gives quite
spidery lashes but I know a lot of
people quite like that look this
definitely isn't an everyday lash look
right back to blusher because I do need
a little bit of color
all that contouring this I picked up in
Sephora it's from Tasha Harper and it's
the volumizing lip and cheek tint I'm
just gonna put my finger in there a
couple of times I'm gonna smile at this
little weird smile and dab it on my
cheek and then I've just got a little
duo fiber brush just to kind of blend
that in
it's very subtle and pretty there I
really like this and you can use on the
lips as well that's the blush I've done
and then I'm just gonna end with lips
you guys know I was out in New York with
Urban Decay because they've launched a
hundred new lipstick shades and they're
called vice lipsticks the only one I've
actually got the lip liner for is the
shade insanity so I'm going to use that
lip liner and lipstick but then I might
go over the top a bit with a shade
called a liar I'm really into lipliner
at the moment I keep seeing comments
when you guys my videos asking if I've
had my lips done I definitely have and
I'm just kind of quite enjoying wearing
like nude slightly over lined lips I'm
just going around the edges and then
when I do the top lip I like to draw in
a bit of a Cupid's bow and then the
lipstick is in a cream finish so it's
very comfortable and easy to wear this
is a very nude color though so let's see
I do you think that's nice but it's very
kind of creamy nude so I'm just gonna go
over at the top with a shade called a
liar just a bit more pinky nude so that
is the final look using some of the new
products that I've been trying out that
I've been buying in America and I hope
you guys enjoyed seeing them in action
