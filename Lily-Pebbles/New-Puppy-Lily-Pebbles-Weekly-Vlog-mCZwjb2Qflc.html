it's just a day at home today I'm
wearing it's makeup because I'm
hopefully gonna film today although my
name's downstairs has moved out which we
thought was weird
that's because they're getting their
bathroom redone so I don't know how long
it's gonna go on for but there's really
really large drilling right below me so
that's a bit annoying but they seem to
have stopped so I'm gonna try and film
maybe my friend Mars or Marielle is her
proper name who you guys might remember
from our wilderness block she's gonna
come over for lunch our sofas getting
delivered today which is so exciting I
think we're gonna get some cupboards
made at some point that's quite a lot
going on although I'm not actually
leaving the flat will day I've just been
getting ready and listening to some
music try drawing out the drilling and I
just took a selfie for breast cancer
awareness where you show your bra strap
so that'll be on my Instagram if you
guys want to go see that it's quite a
nice way to kind of help promote a good
cause very easy to do on social media
and obviously you can donate as well
which is really important
oh no the banding started again I might
try and set up to film and just try and
like speak in between the banging the
banging has full-on started again so I'm
gonna delay it filming yesterday I did
it back to Mac which is that you could
take six empty Mac products back to kind
of recycle and you get a free lipstick
so I picked this one I always like to
pick something that I haven't tried
before
instead of like me purchasing something
because I know I'll get that anyway and
I've never heard of this it looks right
on my street food fast play
it's an amplified lipstick and that's
what I'm wearing today so I think I'm
gonna take some photos and do it or blog
posts on it
well my happen to do at the moment is
use my personal hotspot on my phone I'm
with Vodafone so I don't normally have
unlimited data I'm just on like a three
month unlimited day the thing that God
so I'm using my data from my phone
and linked into my computer so I have
some kind of internet it's obviously not
strong enough or uploading videos but
it's fine for like writing blog posts so
that is what I'm going to do now I've
just taken some photos of the lipstick
I'm
a post for next week and to check my
emails and stuff this is what a thick
looks like inside I eat it with the skin
because I think it's a little really
yummy oh it's very weird looking fruit
but it's so yummy it's like kind of a
savory fruit just taking my nail polish
off and this is the worst thing I'm
taking off this is chanel regional I
like dark now pull it it goes everywhere
and it just like smudges around your
hand it's so hard to go I haven't worn
Essie cocktail bling in so long I love
this color it's like a slightly lilac e
grey okay I need to clear up a bit
because this is where the sofas gonna go
this is gonna be really weird to have a
big safer in here it's gonna feel like
suddenly we haven't got as much room as
we thought we did but I'm excited to
have something nice to sit so now I need
to like find something I felt my
cushions and stuff space cleared and
soon this space will be filled with
hopefully a beautiful gray sofa
hey I'm step out some lunch for when
math comes and I made my quinoa salad
I've got blog post for this so I made
some of that last night rich takes time
to work and then I bought like figs and
Parma ham and salami mozzarella
Mads is about to arrive and I just seen
the safer turnip outside I knew they
would come at the same time we ended up
ordering our safer from multi York
because we ordered one from M&amp;amp;S it was
like 900 quid which is good for a sofa
or maybe it was like actually think was
600 pounds but it we then realize that
our entryway is too small to bring a
sofa off and they don't put in through
windows anymore because of health and
safety so we ended up ordering on from
multi york because it basically comes in
pieces and they put it together in the
flap so I think for so for the nice we
put together we found a really nice one
because a lot of them weren't that
comfortable so it's just a ride and
they're now gonna basically it comes
whole and they've got to take apart in
the van and then put it back together in
the flat so that's what they're doing
now taking my so for a part in a van
this is my favorite type of lunch quinoa
salad fig Parma ham salami
olives I love these big green ones and I
gonna cut up some mozzarella and
sprinkle on this delish these olives are
amazing by the way so far is being put
together it's huge but it's comfy I need
to something comfy nice and deep
it looks a bit weird I need to like put
stuff on it it's a bit empty but I'm
happy with it Mars is here now hello and
we're having a yummy lunch and I want to
tell you guys I was gonna wait till she
was here but Mads also has a YouTube
channel she's just when did you start
and she does like crafty DIY stuff and
she's always been amazing and things
like that so I'm gonna link her YouTube
channel down below and you guys should
get check her check out her channel and
give her some YouTube tips I'm trying to
give her some tips but she's she's new
and we're just looking through my
ranking book the Q book so it's
basically just loads of different people
swearing houses in there keep out by
Charles appropriate for my nieces and
nephews come on Luther just lends it a
comment what I've got my camera out on
your hair cuz I love this I love that
genuinely have like I used to get this
done in Caribbean to get those done you
get so every first moment doing a hair
braid I'm actually but I'm gonna do a
video with the girl and it's braids my
hair yo cuz I wonder when I time how do
you take them out they actually they're
like the platinum they're not done wrong
cuz I know said their issues you I think
it was Anna or someone just cut it but
should realize the hair we're gonna do
hair
but and when I tie my hair up I want to
have like loads coming at the top cool
such a hippie this multi york left this
of me is an actual tool for like getting
like the material in like really there's
a thing for that well that's gonna use
this for mars went to columbia flower
market and found a stationary shop you
know guys know how much I love my
stationary look at this I feel like you
can't even see how good it is it's a
gold-plated what's not gold plate you
just like fake gold right gold bic pen
oh my god it's beautiful can you refill
it when it runs out I'm gonna take Mars
very so now to add to my collection
Mars is just left and I love you so fur
is so nice to have a sofa it's so comfy
and deep oh I'm just gonna like lie here
watch TV not now at some point in my
life oh let's see how her photo came out
it's just ah cute I just spoke to the
builders downstairs and they said they
finish at 5 which is in like an hour so
I'm gonna do it for work and then prep
and then film as soon as they leave ok
I'm gonna film a video my boots haul
which I think you would have seen right
now I think I've got a small gap before
I've got a call at 5 I think the
builders have stopped they've gone quiet
I'm gonna try and quickly film now I
still haven't figured out what my setup
is but I'm just gonna sit here you just
have the Builder here now because our
boiler for some reason is here which is
such an awkward spot and had a huge
cover the way to the floor we got rid of
that because always we would be able to
put a TV here so I think he's gonna make
cupboard to like cover the boiler and
have a spare covered here and then cover
the pipes we'll see how this goes you
still haven't managed to film and guys
just gone outside this is happening now
their childhood I've build around this
so I haven't managed to film yet and
he's still building the cupboard and
it's now like 6 o'clock the sun's going
down I'm hiding in the bedroom because I
think it's really awkward to like watch
builder what he does is work but it's
kind of like nearly severed now I need
to start making dinner rich is home
alright
this is what's been happening for the
last like four hours this wooden panel
that we're gonna have to paint and the
shell of a cupboard and that took quite
a long time and now dinner's nearly
ready just roasting some veg in there
and then I'm gonna eat and then probably
film
I don't know how slicing is gonna work
but I'm gonna try my best
tonight spinners not very adventurous
roasted veg and fish I filmed the entire
video twice and then started editing it
and I just wasn't happy with it the
light was just so bad and I was all
rushing you when I was doing it and
anyway I decided I'm just gonna have to
refilm it tomorrow morning quickly edit
and then go to gleam and upload it with
their Internet's just a little bit
annoying but it's fine I'm enjoying just
chilling on our nice new so for now I
hidden that's all for today so I'm gonna
carry on vlogging on Sunday because
we're getting a new puppy so exciting so
I'll see you guys then it's Sunday
morning now and I didn't do any fancy
morning shots because I actually
overslept and woke up and it's like yeah
makeup banana leave so I'm doing
something a bit strange this morning
well it won't be strange to most of you
but it's definitely strange to me I'm
going to a wedding dress shop now I
think you guys haven't spoken much about
getting married and our wedding I'm not
the usual bride you guys know I'm not
very girly I'm not ready and I've always
just wanted a really relaxed wedding I'm
probably gonna be doing quite a few
things differently not because I think
that the normal way is wrong it's just
what I like I don't think I mean I won't
be having bridesmaids
I'll have the little kids but I won't be
having kind of friends of mine and
matching dresses I probably won't have a
cake because I don't ever eat the
wedding cake and I don't know we're
saving money on places where we think is
necessary
so I've always I can't I literally can't
imagine me in a white wedding dress it's
probably the weirdest thing in the world
I'm literally like that Brian he's like
does it come in black so I've always
thought maybe I'll just go to Selfridges
and get a really nice designer dress
because they're probably the same price
if not cheaper because I feel like when
you add the word wedding on to things
they get seriously expensive and I
cannot believe how to avoiding dresses
are I really can realize and it makes me
feel a little bit sick to spend that
much money on one day so the reason I'm
explaining this to you because I drove
past a wedding dress shop the other day
in London and it said that they were
having a huge sample sale today on
Sunday so although one I feel like I'm
really not ready obviously we have a
venue but I'm not ready to be trying on
dresses yet and the fact that I wanted
to avoid going to a wedding dress shop
first of all look at other options first
I'm now going to wedding dress shop
because there's a sample sale it's like
a one-off full-on like there's always
like a sample sale rack but this is like
a full day and I feel like if I can get
a really nice dress in the settle then I
will I don't care if it's like the one
that I'd want to try it on you can get
it dry-cleaned and a panty look at the
sample sizes are 12 anyway which is my
size so I'm just gonna have a look I
don't know I might not even end up
trying any on if it's mental in there
and there's like loads of crazy Brides
that I'm leaving I'm taking my mom at
Deb's she's like my feel like all my
friends and my sisters they all have
very different what's the word talents
and I know I'll be going to all of them
for different things and advice and help
and Deb's are definitely the person you
are she knows like my style and I really
trust her opinion so I don't know I
might not even show any on god I'm
babbling this is how I feel about
wedding dresses it's freaking me out
people so
I'm gonna go there I'm not gonna vlog it
but I'll let you know how it goes
they're scary with samples but I think
if you find the one the one you have to
buy it let's see how it goes we went to
the wedding dress shop like I said and
obviously there was like a queue of
people there and so we put our name down
and they said they'll call us it's about
a two-hour wait so we're gonna go walk
around up the street but I still haven't
decided if actually gonna go in there or
not because he'll it's in the window and
they're all like corseted like boned you
know proper wedding dresses which isn't
really what I'm looking for it's quite
frustrating you can't go and have a look
before you decide whether you want to
wait or not so we're just gonna go we
might go see if we can walk into another
mode and just shop I think you can make
appointments for these things so we went
into a shop called home and pantry which
is in Camden passage and is in turn it's
so nice they've got all really nice home
bits I booked some cards and my mum
bought some really nice fake flowers
that don't look fake and I also got a
mirror for my office so pretty happy
other okay now in
I should put lane Deb's is here and she
inspired me to get bold rather than a
burrito and it was good I didn't even
finish that with the rap it's just a
little bit much really and for those of
you who hate coriander they do right
without coriander and there's herbs
knows her non coriander stuff we haven't
heard a phone call from the wedding
dress shop yeah but we're gonna walk
back and see how many people are in
front of me in the queue and it was too
long they might not bother because rich
is on his way back from Wales he climbed
Mount Snowdon with Alex and Ali machines
and he happens to be quite near to where
poppy is that he's bringing the Paki
back I'm so excited to meet her
and he's gonna be back in like an hour
so okay we came back to the shop and
apparently what sorry we went into
Mirror Mirror which is the bridal shop
and it was quite interesting actually it
was very weird I just feel like I was
playing dress up I just looked too
the dresses are too grown-up for me and
two for more but it was good to know
like what kind of waistline suits me and
how high the neck and stuff just it's so
hard to find a dress that's special
enough
you want to wear at your wedding but it
doesn't look just - it doesn't look -
mmm - no struggling to explain myself
but any casual Brides out there might
know what I mean it's hard to find a
dress that's right enough good enough a
wedding isn't like a wedding dress and
it'll get a head home now and meet the
puppy I'm so excited to meet this puppy
rich has been in the car with this puppy
and Alex Victoria's boyfriend for like
five hours and I think they've made a
little bond which is really cute I'm
just so excited to meet her
I think her name is Juno that's why we
decided to call her little Juno so I'll
introduce you to her when rich gets home
so we have a new member of the family
this is - no do you know how to come
back don't fall in the pond hey hey you
like the string on my camera
she's very little and very sweet and
she's just exploring the garden Oh pull
in the bed
Gina she doesn't really know her name
yet
back at the flat now and I'm just trying
to give it a big tidy up because I
haven't really been here much this
weekend and it's a bit of a mess so just
doing my tidying things you know well I
think I think I name should be dunno
because we're kind of used to calling
her back now my dad's not sure about it
she's very very cute she's chewing like
bark or cry once the whole time I was
there she's very chilled very
inquisitive and curious and just really
really cute so looking forward to
getting to know her we have hardly
anything in the fridge puffins some like
random veg so I'm making us soup I've
just cut up celery carrots courgette
onion garlic and I kind of just like
fried them off a little bit and then I
added in
boo-yan which is like a vegetable stock
I love this stuff and some hot water and
then you could definitely just eat it
like that but I'm actually gonna throw
it in my Vitamix and kind of package it
up it'll be all soft and creamy and it
also makes it taste better I don't know
how this magic thing does that but it
definitely makes it taste better this
looks like gross baby food but it's
gonna be delicious I'm gonna end my vlog
now because eckesachs has just started
we're gonna get comfy watch X Factor
hope you guys enjoyed this week's vlog
and I'll see you on Thursday Oh
Thursday's video special I filmed it
yesterday and I'm really excited about
it so I hope you like it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
