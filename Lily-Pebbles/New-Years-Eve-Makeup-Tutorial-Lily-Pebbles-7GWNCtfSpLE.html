New Year's Eve makeup tutorial and I
tweeted a while ago saying even though
I'm not going out for New Year's would
you guys like to see a tutorial and most
of you said yes so here is this is the
look that I'm doing I am actually going
to a friend's house for New Year's Eve
we do like a house party every year and
we swap this year we're doing fancy
dress and it's famous couples I'm not
gonna say who me and Richard go he knows
because I don't want to ruin it but
follow me on Twitter or Instagram and
I'm sure there'll be a photo it's gonna
be hilarious so I won't look like this
on New Year's Eve but I thought for some
of you who are going out you might want
like a nice elegant party look and I
really like this makeup it's kind of
contoured glowy skin with a very simple
basic Goldeneye and a really dark
intense like purpley plum lit so I
really hope you enjoy the tutorial and
I'm gonna start again with a bare face
and show you how I got this left the
first thing I've done off-camera
is scrubbed my lips because they're
really dry and flaky at the moment just
because the time of year in the cold
weather so I've used the pixi nourishing
lip polish which is quite cool because
it has exfoliator on the applicator and
I'm just gonna put on a bit of lip balm
now so that by the time I get to my lips
they should no longer be dry okay
lip balm on and I don't really know what
I'm doing today but I'm just I've never
really done this specific look before
but I'm just going to go with the flow
and hopefully it'll be very New Year's
Eve e I'm gonna start with a little bit
of Charlotte Tilbury super magic cream
this is a mini sample I got in my advent
calendar and this is just gonna really
hydrate my skin because really dry at
the moment and I find that by the time I
go to apply my makeup the moisturizer
that I put on in the morning is never
quite enough so this is like a nice
layer and then I'm going to apply a
really small amount of the makeup
forever smoothing primer this is a tiny
sample that I got in a Christmas set and
I'm just gonna apply that where I want
to smooth the skin this is slightly
skintone this primer I'm just going to
put on the side of my nose this should
help the makeup to last longer as well
foundation I've chosen to use is the
Burberry one just because it's really
glowy is slightly lightweight in formula
for my kind of spotty skin that I have
at the moment but I really like the
finish and I don't want anything too
heavy so I'm going to be using the
Burberry one the shade I use is aqua and
nude I think that's it the aqua Oprah I
don't really know so I'm just gonna
apply that to where I want it on my
cheeks nose tiny bit on my forehead and
then to start blending that out I can
always layer more on top if I need it it
is a really sheer foundation as I said
it just gives the skin such a pretty
glow it's worth spending a bit of time
just layering it up to the coverage that
you want so now I've blended that in I'm
just going to apply it a little bit more
to my chin a little bit more to the to
my nose area as well and then just like
Pat that into the skin I love this
foundation but it's become really hard
to get hold of bribery I've stopped
selling in John Lewis and Selfridges and
maybe you can only get it online or in
their Burberry stores and there aren't
many of those so that's a little bit
annoying as my foundation is still wet
I'm going to take this opportunity to
apply a bit of liquid highlighter this
is the Becca shimmering skin Perfector
in opal and I'm just going to use my
fingers to tap the tiny bit on the tops
of my cheekbones and this will just
blend in really nicely with my
foundation no just look like part of my
skin add some really nice like
luminosity I'm kind of in between all
different concealers at the moment I
haven't got one that I absolutely love
or one that has a great color match for
me so I'm gonna be using a couple of
different concealers the first one is my
Charlotte's Hillberry it's the retoucher
in number 2 and this is a slightly
lighter one so I use it in the inner
corners and the outer corners just to
lighten up where it's really dark this
is a really sheer concealer so I tend
not to kind of blend it too hard just
tap it lightly and then I'm gonna use my
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer which
is a little bit too dark for me but I'm
just going to apply a little bit of that
under the eye down the nose because I
bronze up my ski and I can kind of get
away with it being a bit too dark okay
I'm going to leave the concealed in
there and the next thing I'm going to do
is just powder a little bit of the skin
I like the glow on the cheeks but just
down the center of the face I'm going to
be using the Laura Mercier loose powder
which I really like at the moment I just
kind of shake up and then take a tiny
amount of product and swish it around in
the lid I also like to use one of these
duo fiber brushes because then you don't
take too much products I don't want to
look too powdery and I just like to put
that
the eye on top of the eyes as well
slightly around the nose and on the chin
okay so the base that's done but I'm
looking a little bit pale so I'm just
going to bronze up my skin obviously
using my soap and glory solar powder
bronzer I love this bronzer I'm just
gonna do it how I usually do just run
the edge of the face very natural bronze
nothing too intense then what I'm also
going to do is contour a little bit just
using the Kevyn Aucoin contour powder
I'm gonna take a really small amount and
just very lightly blend it under my
cheekbones and that just gives it a
little bit more shape to the face before
I do my brows I'm just gonna put in a
little bit of blusher this is tart
exposed and I like this because I'm
gonna be wearing quite a dark lip so
this is quite subtle it just gives a
nice kind of soft plummy color to the
cheeks this is the Bobbi Brown sheer
powder brush and it applies the perfect
amount
okay brow time and I'm just filling them
in with Anastasia brow Wiz just a little
bit at the front and on the arches and
then to set them in place I'm going to
use this clear brow gel that I actually
got in Vienna it's from a brand called
look look by Pippa o slippers own brand
I really like this actually
I'm just running that through my brows
just to set them it's lightly brushing
them upwards I actually really need to
get my brows and thread into quite badly
okay using another product that I picked
up in Vienna this is a nude eyeliner
that you just put inside your eye just
to brighten the eyes it makes you look
more awake and I think it will go really
nicely with this look this is from a
brand called Catrice and this is
actually a really good dupe for the
tarte eyeliner the packaging and
everything is really similar the top one
it's slightly softer to apply this one's
pretty good so I'm just gonna apply it
to the inner part of my eye here I know
it looks really weird but it really
makes you look more weight just more
awake it just makes the redness skin
toned for my eye shadow I'm gonna keep
things pretty simple and just use one
eyeshadow this is new to me it's the
Burberry pale barley eyeshadow Anna and
so many other youtubers love it and have
loved it for years I don't know why I
haven't picked it up but bo-breeze kind
of hard to find but I got it and I
really like it
like Mac patina it's just like a sheer
kind of cool toned gold and it's really
pretty so I'm just gonna wash that all
over the lid
it's a very pretty eye shadow definitely
worth picking up ply it's at the other
lid and then I'm using a small brush to
also apply that slightly underneath the
eye just to balance it out
I'm not going to apply any eye line or
any other eyeshadow in the crease or
under the eye because I think when you
put on lots of mascara and a dark lip it
can look really fresh and pretty so I'm
gonna apply my mascara which is the
Tarte gifted mascara this is a new
bottle and this is a really good mascara
for volume it's got quite a big brush
which I know not everyone is a fan of
but look at that it does amazing things
to my lashes okay top lashes done I'm
gonna leave the bottom lashes without
any mascara on and just make sure all my
lip balm is rubbed in
I'm gonna start by using a lip liner
this one is from Clinique and it's
really pretty shade it's called intense
licorice the lipstick that goes with
this I think is a little bit too creamy
for New Year's Eve so I am going to just
use their lip liner and then use a Tom
Ford lipstick I'm just gonna line the
lips like a really deep purple
okay so I've lined the lips looking good
and then I'm gonna put on a lipstick and
I'm gonna start with just the Tom Ford
black dahlia but if I feel like it's a
bit too dark I might mix it with a red
but I'm gonna start with black dahlia
and I think I'm use a lip brush just so
it doesn't go on too strong and I have a
bit more control over the color I really
like applying lipstick with a lip brush
okay now I'm gonna apply a bit straight
from the bullet that's the lipstick I
like it's really dark and daring and
bold but I think you just have to go for
it so I'm gonna leave the look there
it's a little bit vampy but I think it's
perfect for New Year's Eve and I really
like kind of simple basic I with a
really dark intense lip so thank you so
much for watching I hope you guys have a
really fun and safe New Year's Eve and
I'll see you in the new year
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
