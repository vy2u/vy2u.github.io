had a really lovely Christmassy week for
today's video I'm going to be doing an
easy makeup tutorial and this is how I'm
going to be doing my makeup or New
Year's Eve and it's what I'm wearing
right now so if you still need a few
ideas about your makeup keep watching so
first I'm going to use a primer to make
sure my makeup lasts the whole night
then I'm going to be using the laura
geller spackle trio this has a face
primer in the bottom and an eye and lip
primer in the list so I'm going to be
using the face primer first and this is
very similar to the Laura Mercier primer
it's very kind of water-based and fresh
feeling and then I'm just going to use
the eye primer this look is very much
about the eyes I'm not doing much to my
lips as you can see so I'm going to use
the I promise to make sure my shadow
stays in place then onto foundation and
I'm going to be using the YSL you that
liberates a foundation remember if you
are going out try and use a foundation
that doesn't have SPF in it because it
will flash back in photos but I'm just
going to a friend's house so I don't
think there'll be much flash photography
there so I'm going to use this because
it needs a really nice glow and I'm just
buffing this in with the Real Techniques
buffing brush blending it around all the
edges down my neck making sure it's
completely smooth
now onto concealer and first of all I'm
going to use my Bobbi Brown corrector in
light bisque and using a just standard
concealer brush I get it right in the
corners of my eye when there's any dark
blue or purples and then blend out using
the Real Techniques setting brush once
I've corrected any dark circles I'm then
going to use the NARS radiant creamy
concealer under my eye and this is in
the shade vanilla it's really
brightening creamy it's not at all cakey
and I just blend that with the same
brush making sure I go all the way to
the edge of the outer corner of my eye
to conceal the rest of my face I'm going
to use the Make Up For Ever full cover
concealer this is so nice and creamy you
can use your fingers or a brush to blend
it out I just apply it to my chin around
my nose down my nose anywhere where I
have any spots and sometimes I use a bit
under my eyes as well if I need extra
coverage there so after the foundation
and all that concealing I want to make
sure everything stays and sets in place
so I'm going to use a translucent powder
translucent just means there's no colors
there's no extra coverage it just sets
everything in place now I'm going to be
using the soap &amp;amp; Glory kick-ass powder
with the Charlotte Tilbury powder and
sculpt brush I really like this brush
because you can get right into the
corners of the eye I like to set under
my eye my forehead
my nose on my chin I'm just a light
dusting of powder but it really sets
everything in place now on to bronze em
because this foundation shape is
slightly yellow for me I like to use a
little bit extra bronzer just to kind of
get back to normal skin color so I don't
look too sallow and I'm going to use the
NARS Laguna bronzer with my Real
Techniques blush brush and I just use
like a three shape around the side of my
face make sure I go down to my neck or
my ears just in case they show and down
my nose just add in a bit of extra glow
and warmth to my face gets me is Eve so
a bit of kind of glitzy highlighter I
think isn't essential and I'm going to
use the benefit Watts up highlighter
which comes with like a stick on one end
and then kind of blender on the other
but I like to just use my finger rub it
on and then apply it to the tops of my
cheekbones down my nose on my Cupid's
bow sometimes under my brow you can also
use this in the inner corner of your eye
it's really versatile because it's cream
and looks natural but it's also very
kind of highlighting and you can
definitely see it captures in the light
and it's really pretty because the eyes
are a little heavy I like to keep my
blush quite basic and neutral so I'm
going to use the Becca flower child
blush which is one I've absolutely been
loving this and with that my Bobbi Brown
sheer powder brush which is just the
perfect size for blush it's really soft
you don't apply too much and this blush
just adds a little bit of color without
being too bright that's just perfect and
really complements this eye look okay
now onto the brows and because the eyes
are quite heavy I want to even things
out and make sure my brows just look
kind of perfect so first of all I'm
going to use the hourglass arch brow
sculpting pencil and I really love this
it comes with a little spooley on one
end so I like to brush out my brows kind
of brushing them upwards and then I use
the other end which is a really soft
pencil and just fill in the beginning
parts that's the only part I really need
to fill in and just make sure it is even
so I very lightly add some strokes there
and do it on both sides and then once I
am done i use the blink clear brow gel
and this just sets everything in place
keeps my brow hairs in place because
they like to move around a lot they are
quite long and just and then they just
stay there this is really nice doesn't
leave any white bits it doesn't make
your eyebrows crispy it just does the
job really well okay so now on to the
eyes I've already primed them at the
and for this look I'm gonna be using the
new Urban Decay Naked 3 palette I do
like this it's definitely not my
favorites I think I prefer one and two
this one's slightly more rose-colored
and I find quite hard to wear Pink's but
there are a few colors at the top end of
the palette this end which I absolutely
love
the three I'm going to be using a lyre
mugshots and Factory you know very kind
of plummy
taupey tones so they're really nice and
I've actually been wearing this look in
a few of my last videos and I had so
many compliments on my eye looks and
this is how I've been wearing it pretty
much so I'm gonna take my Mac to one
seven brush and I only need one brush
for this look you can actually use all
three shades on this one brush so I
start with the shade lier which is a
really nice kind of pinky light plum and
I just like to put this all over the lid
it's really gorgeous and shimmery and I
absolutely love this color so just using
like a wiper motion make sure you cover
the entire lid with this color then I'm
gonna take mugshot which is a bit more
of a kind of gray taupe and using the
same brush take a little bit and just
work that on the second half of the
outer part of the eyelid again using
wiper motions just making sure all
blends in then I'm gonna take factory
which is in the darkest or brown taupe
and just the like tiny bit on the tip of
the - 1 7 brush I'm gonna take it right
to the outer corner of the eye and just
blend it across the eye so with this
whole thing just keep blending using
wiper motions with the brush and these
three shades really blend really nicely
into each other so your ended like a
nice plummy
taupey brown look with a little bit of
kind of pink shimmer in there I'm also
gonna take that shade factory under the
eye using my amazing Kevyn Aucoin brush
which I love
just taking it under the outer corners
of the eye it really kind of adds
smokiness to the look once all the eye
shadow has been applied I like to take a
big fluffy eyeshadow brush this is my
Bobbi Brown one just anything that's big
fluffy and soft and then using really
fast wiper motions just blend out that
shadow on the edge so there's no kind of
harsh edges just really keep blending
blending blending and it will look
really nice when you're done so I'm not
finished yet on the eyes and really
wants to add something a little bit
special it is New Year's Eve
is all about the glitter and the shimmer
so I'm going to be using the urban decay
diamond dog eyes shadow and this was
recommended by Amelia from Liana Beauty
and it's amazing I would never ever
normally use a glitter eye shadow but
there's just something about this it's
beautiful it's like a topi brown eye
shadow with intense silver glitter I
asked the lady at the Cancer like how
he'll do I applied this without ending
up with glitter everywhere and she said
just kind of press it on with your
finger so the final step of this eye
shadow look is to take some of this onto
my finger and just press it onto the lid
and you'll see it leaves an absolutely
gorgeous silvery glittery shimmer all
over the lid and it just catches the
light beautifully and really kind of
adds to the whole look and makes it very
nice at you once that is done I like to
use an eyeliner I'm not going to add too
much of like a thick line it's just to
make the lashes look a bit fuller and
I'm going to use Mac's Headey which is
just a really nice dark brown I like to
take it all the way along that upper
lash line slightly thicker on the outer
edge but not too much so before I go on
to mascara I like to curl my lashes I
only really do this where I have like
nights out I don't do on an everyday
basis these are the Shu Amira eyelash
curlers which are just the best they
really are I have the gold ones now
which are very pretty so just put them
onto your lashes squeeze very gently
first to make sure that you're not going
to catch your lid and then press down
quite hard for a few seconds and do that
on both lashes and it just opens your
eyes and adds a bit more of a lift and
it really makes a difference before you
apply a mascara so I'm going to be using
two Clinique mascaras for this look for
the top lashes I'm going to use my
absolute favorite high impact extreme
volume this one just gives the most kind
of volume look so I like to use this on
nights out I do have lots of mascaras
that I like but this one is just the
best so for good occasions I have to
always use this so I use this on my top
lashes just wiggling it in at the roots
making sure I get all the way to the tip
of the lashes you can either do two
coats if you need it and then for the
bottom lashes I'm also using the
Clinique I don't know what this is
called but it's like their mini mini
tiny brush and it literally has the
minions brush so you can use this on
your bottom lashes and on the corners if
you missed any lashes at the top as well
so I'm just running this very lightly
because I don't like to put too much
mascara on my bottom
so that's the eyes finished and there's
only one more thing for this look and
it's lit and I don't want to wear bright
red or anything too glossy because their
eyes I mean I have glitter on my eyelids
so I really can't go too over-the-top
with my lips so I'm gonna be wearing
this key Curt lipstick and it hasn't got
a nice name it's just got like a number
I'll link it below it's one of their
kind of creamy formulas and I absolutely
love it comes in this fancy packaging as
well you kind of pop out I really love
this lipstick it's a really nice peachy
kind of nude everyday goes with
everything
not too pink not too peach absolutely
love it's really moisturizing on the
lips but also kind of lost it doesn't
just slip off the lip straight away so
I'm just gonna put that on and I think
that goes really nicely with the kind of
tophi purpley eyes if you're wondering
what's on my nails I have Topshop
moonshine which is really nice rose gold
and then on my fourth accent finger I
have the C art a sequin manicure in miss
mistletoe so this is literally sequins
you put on a top coat and then dunk your
finger in the sequins and after it's a
bit messy you get sequins everywhere you
have to kind of brush them off and then
pour it back into the pot but when
you're done it looks amazing and I
literally have sequin nails which I
think it's so perfect for knees if I
have a blog post on my blog today with
these nails so I'll link that below he's
been going look at Papa photos of them
for my hair I like to take my ghd's and
my hair was already straight but I
wanted to kind of give it a bit of
movement and do something a little bit
more exciting so first of all I used the
Oscar Blandi dry heat protect spray this
is really good because it's an aerosol
it doesn't make your hair wet if it's
already straight you just spray all over
it it protects your hair before you
straighten it so I use that first and
then I take my ghd's and just taking
small sections off the hair I just clip
the issues on and then twist them going
away from the front of the face and then
hold it there for a few seconds
and pull it down and you're left with a
really nice kind of loose wavy curl mine
doesn't really last that long my hair
even when I use hairspray but it just
adds a bit of movements your hair
overall once I've done that all over the
hair
take some of the Bumble and Bumble joys
fun finish spray and just spray this
into the root of the hair to give a bit
of volume and texture and I don't know I
just really like how this makes my hair
look for the ends of my hair that might
look a little bit fluffy I used the
bumble and bumble semi sumo and this is
like a wax I just rub it in between my
fingers and then kind of grip the bottom
of my hair in different sections making
sure I like kind of the finish make sure
there's nothing too fluffy or frizzy
anywhere so then all that's left is to
put on a perfume that you love this one
is from Tom Ford it's completely luxury
and beautiful it's like a grown-up sweet
perfume if you don't love sweet perfumes
this is a great alternative it just
smells like the most sexy perfume ever
so it's appropriate for New Year's Eve
and it just makes me feel really nice so
that was mine easy makeup tutorial and
this is all it looks like nothing too
over-the-top and crazy I'm just seeing
friends but something kind of pretty and
glittery for New Year's Eve I hope you
have fun whatever you're doing on the
night and don't forget to check back on
