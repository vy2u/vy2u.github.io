gonna be my first vlog of my New York
long weekend thing I was in the South of
France with my parents and rich and I
flew back early because Birchbox are
taking me and a couple of other bloggers
to New York so I'm so excited but I
literally landed at midnight last night
it's now 4 o'clock in the morning so I'm
dying a little bit but I'm very excited
and are you excited and if they do have
a last night to keep me company so we're
just waiting for our cab it's really
early but really excited and I'll try
and vlog as much as I can
hopefully I'll remember so in the
airport and we're so early but people at
checking desk not even here yet so we're
just sitting and comparing suitcase
sizes because I have a huge suitcase and
anna has smaller series ever but really
cute Lulu Guinness with lips on it said
what it actually looks like but no its
lips alright always overpack is that's
just what I do but I hopefully they'll
be room for shopping if not I'm just
gonna put it on this case but
shopping in the airport man she sure is
looking so glamorous we need you to
admit Rachel just sat down as we are
absolutely out I can't get over how the
redness I look at how nice these cars
Keisha you are like those of glamorous
travelers just jeans and jeans I never
wear jeans of a fly that's a big no-no I
think it's a breakfast I just want to
get on the flight and get going with it
really I don't like something around the
airport big but we got breakfast
you're selling crown fits and I I got
some yummy fruit salad just on the plane
and we have to have the ones with like
the huge legroom
I do look better - oh yeah so I'm happy
but window my friend it's gonna be good
and as in-flight beauty we haven't even
taken off yet she's got our eye cream on
your little magic bag of wonders
do you want to fly actually I disagree
millions because she gave me the
fetching thought like I'm a real flight
sometimes I think I know where them too
I'm like a mom
smells like orangey what now so I got
I'm going to do is like halfway through
the flight I closed the doors we had
really nice spacious seats we had
premium economy she's lovely
and food was right and watched my stones
and as happy has to find it really worth
it I wasn't you know I could get or
anything for the goods I'm here and I

hotel you're like not even shower and
then we're gonna go have lunch to do a
bit of shopping I think something yeah
