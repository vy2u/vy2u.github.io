moan again every morning I sound like a
man I think I finished the vlog last
night I think Ana and Patricia were
leaving me and then I just kind of
jumped out and went to bed it's 6
o'clock in the morning now which is very
early we are going backstage at the
ruffian show at New York Fashion Week so
we have to get there really early just
to be there like 2 hours early if you're
going backstage and the show starts at
9:00 so I'm already I'll show you my
outfit in a bit we didn't quite awake
actually the morning ZZ that evenings
are hard when you have jet lag here I'm
looking forward to today's I'm very busy
but we've got a huge gap in the middle
for shopping time which is very exciting
so I'll teach you guys along with me
find honor again or name you know ready
breakfast because Ana got room service
cheeky so she's had breakfast so I'm
gonna mush time I get something
increments so early and I'm gonna have
another coffee because I really liked it
one shot latte and it was really nice
and smooth so I think this is kind of
getting the inter coffee and I excited
from my morning coffee this is the
coffee place underneath our hotel it's
so good so you should all come visit I
just thought awesome Lincoln Center and
we're New York Fashion Week Sur is look
at it really cool we carefully how to
take Samantha process here they dope
anything your background she do why
there's no one behind the idea I thought
I'd show you you are wearing and this
jacket
Topshop borrowing yesterday this dress
is from H&amp;amp;M so easy to wear but
virtually empty
can be impossible
me too
today are the colors for the collection
we created with them and in the base of
their color naked which I'm wearing so
then the accents of those and those are
the bottles
so you just come out from backstage and
the power is gone the generator stopped
so there will do makeup and nails and
pitch clap and they've all just carried
on like it's normal they're not even
shocked I'm so funny
they're just so fetch there I really
make it to the dark but the nails are
really cool so ruffian and Birchbox
collaborated to create their own nail
polish specifically for the show and
Birchbox subscribers voted on their
three favorite colors so it's orange
green and a purple color so that's
really cool
and I wasn't really like interesting I'm
going to try it because there's no one
like my nail art I'm gonna give it a go
and yeah it was quite calm backstage
compared to what I've been Trisha who
was the model that you saw that's the
only åkesson which is a friend of yours
George's has done so many times I need
to be in her youth well like a year or
two ago yeah and then every time I'm out
of my element so for sure she seemed
really friendly she's really taken your
there having to do it by the door so
that there's light I want her name just
walking to go and watch the show
which meant start at 9:00 but I don't
know they were always there always late
show done and I really liked actually
there was a dress with like stripes at
the top I really like that a mint
colored dress Luckman really like
wearable roads sometimes it's like
Fashion Week they're kind of crazy but
those were really wearable I really like
them and so there's I was kind of
gathering still quiet because it's early
in the morning later this would be like
heaving but we're done now and we're
going to go to CVS and join read
drugstores and then we're gonna get Soho
and have some lunch and then go back to
the hotel testable work
oh cab 236 and fit which is where we saw
huge CVS and join read a mortgage so sad
I feel like people who are on beauty
addicts gonna watch to speak Wow know we
have all been here before
and theme that Ruggiero okay yeah we
have oh yeah good thing that yeah we
have all been a fool I've seen so much
from you I've been loads so it's just a
little shopping trip really so nice it's
quite quiet Saturday though streets

magazines I've already picked up allure
but they've got this one between the
Beauty Authority new Beauty magazine and
it's perfect and it's full of beauty and
we just don't get bt magazines at home
so I've already put mine in my basket
along with some makeup bits under there
but some stuff from in line and you do
you know the real I'm not that much
stuff they're doing so we just came to
get a drink and we're slightly
overwhelmed by the what's on offer
bloody how it's a whole aisle of drinks
I'm just wondering I have no idea Oh too
much choice I just want like a juice

hopefully there won't be a queue it's
like 11:30 we're so jet-lagged are
starving so we're gonna go to shake

really nice and sunny we're so lucky
with weather and it's outdoors so we
could see outside and eat and the in
petitioner on a hunt for a leather cap I
don't even wear hats but who saw this
model what about James Moss I can't
forget her name's Anna Anna and she's
wearing a leather cap that since then we
all really want wonder so leaving a fine
one after Shake Shack and you know just
really enjoying what
we found Shake Shack finally there's a
bit of confusion with the cabs there's Q

there always is law at the time and it
by the Oh 11:30 is ridiculous or so
excitedly Shh watch the order the double
Shake Shack burger and the make of the
chips and the blueberry I got a 50/50
iced tea half lemonade I don't really
