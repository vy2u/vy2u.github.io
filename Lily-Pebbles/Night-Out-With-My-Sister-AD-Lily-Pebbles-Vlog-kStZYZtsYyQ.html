last night Friday night was the last
vlog and today's Saturday and I'm
vlogging again so no much has actually
changed its them to be such nice weather
today so that is so good I'm happy about
that I'm actually wearing shorts I'm
being quite brave because I just thought
I don't know I don't really have that
many summers mind it with like a thin
sweaters to even out the the coldness I
don't know what we're doing today but I
said to rich or I have a fun day out and
I want to go to like markets and like do
fun outdoorsy things because it's meant
to rain tomorrow so make the most of the
weather I've just been listening to ear
biscuit I listen to I Justine and listen
to che calm now still loving them I was
actually listening to them in bed this
morning instead of like waking up and
putting the TV on I just put the
podcasts on next to my pillow and just
kind of lay there with my eyes closed
listening and it was really nice
oh also I made a little a sauce order
yesterday I ordered two dresses the same
dress in two sizes 10 and a 12 because I
never know where I am
turns out I'm the ten in this one which
is pretty exciting it's a dress from
whistles but I've got a from ASOS and it
looks like this I thought I would wear
this on Monday night to that black tie
thing I have it's kind of boring it's
like a v-neck it's got kind of
crisscross thing at the back it's got
pockets though I'll show you on Monday
when I put it on but I figured I
probably won't wear it that often but it
can't there's no harm in having a little
black dress I feel like everyone needs a
little black dress in their wardrobe and
this one is pretty nice so happy I have
a dress that I do want to try and get
some accessories and jewelry and maybe
shoes as well so maybe you might have
this lots of shopping this weekend
like a parcel came and this is all the
stuff that I've ordered from Amazon
actually sending half I've done like a
double whole tech cool but I'm gonna
make that my next video and tell you
guys what I got but I did get some
camera lenses and I'm very excited I
don't know why I wasn't filming that but
I just got a parcel and I was opening up
and it's from Sammy and Jason from their
November night and they gave me a nice
little note and they've sent me a top
but just so kind of them it came really
nicely like packaged up in tissue with
like a nice big silk ribbon and a nice
little tag and I've just put the top
straight on because I love it so much
this is the black what's called the
Hayden jumper and it's real
like nice kind of thin material what's
it made of 100% cotton it's really nice
I'm actually gonna wear it today and
rich is wearing his one which he ordered
himself yeah from Navy man night and
it's like the men's I'm really upset the
dress is sold out of this cuz I really
want it but hopefully you'll come back
and suck so Thank You Sammy Jason very
if you and I love it definitely wear it
today yeah I'm gonna make some pancakes
using this mixture which I really like
because it's actually actually works and
I think I found the answer to smooth
pancake mix adding the pancake mix bit
by bit instead of all at one and then
mixing as you go cuz that looks pretty
smooth to me my mom just said everyone's
gonna say you're really lazy for not
making your own which is true I am lazy
for not making my own but this just
worked once they start bubbling then you
know to flip them I'm gonna make them
about that size you can see the bubbles
are starting to form on the top they're
quite vanilla we tasting pancakes piping
they're delicious
rich you want any like fruit with them
gonna cut some what I've done for so far
got another one going and it's
definitely enough for like maybe four
more what about one two three four five
six seven pancakes maybe richest
blueberries and strawberries I've just
on strawberries
this is our favorite maple syrup where
do we get this from Amazon wow that's
intense maple syrup but it does last us
quite a long time okay come on rich

been there I want to take that instead

pounds and that's pretty good deal and I
really like them I got myself the
chicken katsu wrap for lunch

excuse my blotchy face and wet have just
come out the shower yesterday was
interesting I had a full-on fever
yesterday like a Shivaree cold then hot
by a keysaw skin I literally couldn't
move I stayed in the entire day which
interested trashy films and now I've
woken up with a cold
that's obviously what it was just trying
to come out this always happens after a
month of daily vlogging to happen to
vlog most I think it's as soon as you
stop it all kind of hits you so yeah I
had a day in just relaxing yesterday but
I'm glad I'm feeling I'm feeling better
today I just don't sound that great
today which is annoying because I wanted
to film some videos and I just sound
ridiculous so I can't but tonight I've
got that black tie do I was talking
about so I'm glad I'm feeling better and
I can still go I don't think I'm gonna
be party in the night away but I'm
definitely gonna go okay my hair is
straight so I'm gonna head downstairs
and do some work and I'll come back to
you guys later when I'm getting ready
for tonight okay I really need to start
getting ready now I have no she said
where we're going tonight me and my
sister are going to the L'Oreal color
trophy Grand Final tonight it's their
60th anniversary if you don't know what
the l'oreal color trophy is it's a huge
event award ceremony for hairdressers
and hairstylist all over the UK and it's
like big thing they all come together
it's like this huge celebration with
awards and it's basically for the hair
industry which is really exciting and
very cool my sister used to work she
used to be like a makeup and hair
stylist and she used to have a hair a
different color every month she's so
into her
I thought she'd like to come and be my
plus-one and Victoria and Alex are gonna
be there so it's getting really fun the
atmosphere it's always really great and
it was so enthusiastic at the Loreal
collar trophy Awards so I'm gonna get
ready now also my sister hilariously is
taking her role of plus-one
so seriously she keeps sending me vlog
footage that she's taking on her phone
of her getting ready so I'm gonna insert
those clips like here in there I think
it's very funny that she's giving
vlogging ago she's good at it though I'm
gonna do my face this face hasn't seen
makeup for like two days and it
desperately needs it I look so ill but
hopefully I will look much better once I
have some makeup on
hello so we are getting ready my birth
thing we did is choose our nail polish
what colors did we choose pink no we
didn't blue and gray demon gray which
maybe you gathered to honey once at the
frozen theme so we've done it let's do
your nails beautiful so we've done every
other with honey and with me we've done
three Gray's and two blues so I've been
suffering my whole life with hand licks
mode which is why my hands it very
elderly enjoy I feel like I've tried
everything any doctor in this country
has given me nothing's worked so nothing
nothing like if any of you suffer from
hi next myrrh and have a miracle cure
can you please tell me so I can try your
amazing cure attempting to give myself
very fresh glowy skin this is what's
really underneath is definitely not
fresh or glowy
so I've come to have a look what shoes
Berry's my dress tonight and I'm hoping
this just looks nice because I haven't
even tried on yet so I found these shoes
they're very high I may be mad but
there's sparkly at the back and I do
love a bit of sparkle so we're gonna try
that and this is the dress you can see
it this sparkle as well so I'm gonna try
it on I'll let you know how I get on
this foundation is a little bit too pale
for me now just a bit annoying that's
why I look a little bit ghost-like
nothing a bit of bronzer can't fix by
the way this is what I do when I'm
getting ready I pretty much just watch
what's up mum's videos so we've held our
first epic fail a rushed mother doesn't
have time to go and get her leg
waxed so silly Lee goes and uses a razor
and this is what happened now and the
dress comes up to here massive epic fail
okay
I've kind of nearly done my makeup I
haven't done any lipstick or anything
cuz I'm gonna hear downstairs and make a
cup of tea now if now go and get Bailey
from school then we've got to get back
quickly make the kids some dinner put
the dress on put a bit makeup on that
was a seriously good cup of tea by the
way can you tell it's me I'm very aware
that me and my sister have matching
voices indeed a baby's been singing the
whole way honey baby yeah okay I'm just
using straighteners to get like soft
kind of waves in my hair just my usual
style nothing fancy okay let's talk you
through my outfit so far so para makeup
pretty standard lips standard a combo
you guys know the dress I've shown you
kind of whistles got a nice pocket it's
very comfortable which is key for me
nice kind of V but not too low this
necklace I got form Urban Outfitters on
the weekend it's like two little
triangles it was sweet and wearing loads
of different rings none of which match
which is kind of how I like it
or I should put some bracelets on as
well here I've just chucked on whatever
bracelets I have and I'm gonna write my
clothes shoes which I'm really happy
with I'll always prefer to be
underdressed than overdressed I think
they look so good and I think I think
that guys yeah I like them and they're
so comfy I think it's the elastic here
I'm not even joking but my
brother-in-law needs a sledgehammer to
do something in the garden so I've got
to take my dad's sledgehammer in the cab
with me to my sister's on the way to
this black-tie event and I think the cab
drivers gonna think that I'm killing him
this is lip this is like half the size
of me I'm in the cab now with Jojo and I
have one
okay we've just realized because it
started to rain when I got in the cab
with my sledgehammer dropped in for JJ's
and the calf is still alive and it was
still bleeding back in the 80s the dress
it's nice that this trend stirred you
got a sauce for a wedding and it came in
marks all over it as like 30 thank God
for both wipes because they got rid of
the way I think that's so
right and I was just worried because it
was like too late to do any other and
any other e1i way to battle to see which
is the miles away running a little bit
late it was seemed to have driven into
some kind of London Marathon which is
not good news right we have arrived
I'm going to go ahead to the Oh - oh my
okay we just entered the awards and it's
mental there's so many people it's
absolutely
I'm a glitzy board so I think we gonna
sit down and then they're gonna start

Awards and three dinners
here we go

photography now we're gonna head back to
our table now measure me some more
Awards
the winner is

more on the cat it has been a crazy
night we're in the cab on the way home
I've lost my voice I always lose my
voice when I go out like even if I'm not
drunk I swear it's a family thing
parenting my sister and mom get it so it
was amazing
L'Oreal color trophy is like this huge
event is less such a secret industry
thing but all the hairdresser's all the
sad ones around the UK are there and
they're so passionate about it when they
win the awards they're so happy and I
crying it was an amazing atmosphere and
we had such a nice time to do it next
