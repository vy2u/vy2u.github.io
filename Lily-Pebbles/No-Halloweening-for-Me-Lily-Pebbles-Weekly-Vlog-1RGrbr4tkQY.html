morning well it's actually like 12
o'clock now because I was doing some
work this morning it's a great time to
reply to emails cuz no one's there to
reply back so you can kind of just work
your way through your inbox which is
great so I've been doing that Rich's
doing a workout and then I was getting
ready I'm sorry I've got a really greasy
weekend pair and it stinks of cooking
from last night's dinner really gross
and I'm wearing really scruffy clothes
but it's the weekend I'm so happy it's
here and we don't really have much plan
as this weekend but there wasn't any
time this week for me to vlog so it's
gonna be a kind of mellow we can vlog
instead tomorrow's my best friend
Jenna's birthday says tonight we're
going out for dinner and apart from that
I'm not really sure but a couple of new
things have arrived in our lounge so I
can show you first of all these chairs
which are from West Elm they are new and
I love them you can't really see them
cuz there's stuff on it you can kind of
see that one there and our TV unit from
made calm has arrived and I love that to
keep forgetting that today's actually
Halloween and I'm not only doing I'm not
doing anything at all this year so I've
kind of forgotten about it but we're
drawing upon all the houses that
decorate at the cobwebs and stuff find
it weird the Halloween's like a big
thing now because in the UK it never was
when I was younger Americans always took
it very seriously in the UK we just did
trick-or-treating and that was about it
but I feel like now because social media
stuff and everyone's are quite global
everyone takes it seriously and suddenly
English people are very Halloweeny
my parents are walking somewhere and I
know it's you know you haven't really
walked it properly yet so we're gonna
see if we can just find them it's kind
of a big area to find number let's see
probably one of these beeping sensors
are the most no no I
this sitting eating lunch and I've got a
blanket on because I was cold
Juno's decided to get married she's in
there
it's time to leave but Gina is all
tucked up in the little blanket
we had a really nice walk and a quick
bite of lunch and now we're gonna head
to my sister's because she's having a
lot of Halloween policy for the kids and
we're not technically invited cuz I
don't have kids I never get invited to
these fun things so I'm just gonna get
crush and turn up because Halloween
party sound like fun saves me lots of
kids and like decorations and I don't
really know your activities maybe we're
gonna skip scaring on sweets
Carly's done them pumpkins little house
and scary front door thing Jojo did this
that is horrific
Oh through the scary black things it was
your outfit the cook Holly's prepped for
this table of last painting
you should start like kids entertainment
parties
Oh strawberry supplements hey judge is
gonna face it meet me going up dinner so
nothing to your mental JJ's intense face
painted okay okay we're just going to go
through a spiderweb
this is what mum makeup artists use for
that kid
granny bag do you know absolutely
nothing from my walk she's been lioness
past three hours this is too little for
long walks yeah we're gonna take the
kind of long route home because you want
to go look at some crazy Halloween
houses and seal the trick-or-treaters
because it's dark now so better all out
this is the traffic going to Jonathan
Ross's house because he has this like
big front garden party for the public
and then his god and he has this huge
celebrity partying all their cars turn
up so every year this is so much traffic
it's ridiculous
they've closed off the road because of
Jonathan losses party he'll arias for
Jenna's birthday which is tomorrow
it always is on Halloween and she's
always annoyed some Halloween but
obviously her birthday is more important
so we're getting out for a lovely dinner
Joe got my face paint on and yeah I
don't know what kind of food is so but
I'm hungry I'm excited to eat the houses
that we drove past we're insane one of
them was like a huge haunted house and
there was like queues of people
trick-or-treating and Jonathan Ross's
house around there was a gridlock I
reckon they're gonna stop me from doing
that party soon because it literally is
mental around where he lives
I'm really excited about my razor strop
your dreams they're tucked in now we're
gonna go back to X Factor and have a cup
of tea like I should be filming the
commentary to mates after you're sad no
I wonder popular put my camera away in a
minute I'm sorry yeah sad that Simon's
beards go and I think he looked much
better before
okay I'm gonna finish buggy now because
I'm really really tired German Ben just
left taken off my face plane I use the
baby wife and I feel really Russia also
by later I will vlog again tomorrow we
have no plans but I'm sure I make
something interesting nice
it's now Monday morning I didn't end up
vlogging yesterday because well if I'm
completely honest meme rich or a really
bad mood I thought I've been really
awkward David vlogging we're all good
now though as you do and it's Monday
morning so back to work haven't we got
that much plan today basically it's got
to get a lot of work done and then I'll
go to a party shop to pick up some
supplies first thing I need to do I
think is edit the first part of this
vlog because whenever I blog on a Monday
it's always really last-minute to get it
up for the Tuesday so I'm going to try
and edit day one some of you had
disappointed that I didn't do my little
extract a commentary on snapchat last
night because I think last week I was
just talking my exact on snapchat you
guys seem to like it I'm a big fan of
x-factor well not really the whole idea
of it but I mean you know it's easy
watching TV and this year I think the
people I met your quite good so last
night whoopsie when and alien uncovered
and I completely agreed with both of
those didn't think it was very good and
alien uncovered I am surprised they went
so early because they were so
professional and they really like knew
their style and they were all very
rehearse but I personally didn't like it
and I think people didn't vote because
they're a bit too intimidating and maybe
a little too confident that's my
thoughts on extract for last night okay
I'm now gonna go to a place called
Oscars den which is like the best party
shop in London that's got everything you
could possibly ever need and they do
like fireworks and Halloween and I've
just like always gone there my whole
life for anything to do with parties so
I'm gonna go there and get a load of
stuff all my friends hem but she might
be watching this vlog so I'm not gonna
show what I'm buying but I want to show
you guys a shop because it's really cool
in there I just need to get ready cuz
I'm gonna be late go this car out again
you remember this one last year I love
it it's like ombre gray and long but
it's gone all like bubbly and horrible
but I still kind of want to wear it look
how crazy the fog is in London today
it's really spooky it's so bad how much
I rely on my diary I just spoke to my
dad he was also I'm seeing you later
yeah so what I forgotten to put
something in my diary and I complete you
for good in it and if I hadn't found him
I would have missed my appointment if
it's not in my diary then I just don't
know it
so this afternoon I'm going to have my
moles checked me and my dad do it every
year I'm actually going to see a
different person this time going to see
dr. marcoh lens who owns the skincare
brands Ellen's that you'd know if your
biggest based on K fad and he's an
incredible guy so I'm glad she's gonna
go see him and introduce my dad to him
see what he says this is Oscars then I'm
gonna go meet my friend in there we're
gonna pick up all the hen supplies they
do got France adjusting everything they
must have been so busy over Halloween
they probably all exhausted now we've
got lots of stuff I'm not gonna show you
in case Gemma watches but this shop is
crazy there's so much stuff I got so
much amazing stuff in us cuz then
they're all like exhausted from
Halloween but now it's Guy Fawkes night
on the 5th of certainement fifth of
December fifth of November so if the
lights go off if you guys need any
fireworks or anything they literally
have everything and they're the
friendliest people in there so just go
in I'll pull them up or whatever and
they will fill your firework
requirements right I'm gonna head home
quickly and I'm excited about all the
stuff that I've got you know he's got to
get him I've got a little bit of time so
I've just heated up last night's dinner
which was like a squash chickpea curry
from Jamie Oliver's recipe I'm just
quickly eating that and then I'm gonna
head into town and meet my dad
now in town and I just popped into more
plan to get some hangers do they do the
best like nonstick hangers non-slip I
know SIA she meant I'm just going to
walk to the doctor now me and my dad are
gonna get checked out
mole marking really isn't very scary
they just look at your body and check
them all see if there's any like
irregular ones and if so you might to
get something removes but it's all very
easy definitely should do it for you
haven't always liked me you have just
been in see dr. marcoh lens and I've got
to go back to have one removed I have
stitches dredging that but it's gotta be
done so now I'm gonna head home picked
up a couple of magazines on the way home
l cuz it's got my favorite on it on the
front and glamour because Tonya then on
the front which is so cool I'm really
proud of her it's such like cool stuff
for Team Internet's they're looking
forward to read an interview and see in
the photos inside I need to make myself
a cup of tea stop okay I had a quick
read of Tiny's interview and it was
great and now I need to do some work
because it's 4:30 and this what happens
when you work for yourself it's been
your whole day doing personal things and
going to doctors and stuff and then you
haven't done any work at 4:30 so that's
what I'm gonna do now and then rich will
come home at half 6:00 and expect dinner
I've just editing my vlog and I
accidentally chorus change in the back
and he literally slips away
ready I'm gonna take that fit out but
it's kind of still in so I don't know
what I'm taking out because I'm leaving
it in this bit but it's really funny
rich just came home and if you heard him
say whoa when you walked in that's
because the house is a mess I knew that
he would say that I've just spent the
last like our tunnel look for a
videographer for our wedding that's the
one thing I'm really struggling with
obviously it's because I'm so fussy
because I do this for a living so I have
a real idea of kind of how I want it to
be and video to me is so important I've
realized that a lot of people don't even
get videographers because some people
that's not really a priority for
obviously to me it is I haven't decided
yet if I'm going to put anything on my
youtube channel or not but either way I
kind of want it to be how I want it some
place some people don't even really let
you pick the music and the videos and
some are like really swishy and like 40
professional some but talking in and
some down and I just haven't found any
that I like and so many of the
videographer websites the videos that
load it's just like really annoying it's
really boring job to do I would say can
you guys recommend anyone but I've had
recommendations if like any of them
don't know what was wrong with me I'm so
fussy about videos but I'm hoping that
we will find someone that's one of the
things prior you've got to get sorted
early because they get booked up so I
don't know we all see I'm gonna make
dinner now and I think we bought some
really nice fresh tomatoes from the so
called like a vegetable stand green
grocers and so I thought it'd make a
nice like fresh tomato garlicky sauce
and I was gonna have it with courgette
II but just tomatoes and courgette this
is a bit vegetable II I think we'll both
be hungry so I'm gonna kind of mix the
courgette II with spelt spaghetti so
it's a bit cloudy as well so I think I
might do that now
we come up closer to get one large
courgette a whole bowl which is fried of
some garlic onions studying all the
different fresh tomatoes they get all
squishy and yummy and then I'm just
going to mix some of this belt spaghetti
with this is what the finished thing
looks like spaghetti
Uncle Jesse with really these tomatoes
smell amazing like really garlicky and
fresh and delicious so I'm gonna enjoyed
this now I'm gonna end login we're gonna
watch Hollyoaks and I will see you guys
on Sunday for my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
