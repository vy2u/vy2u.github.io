really well today as you can see i'm in
a different setting and i'm with sorry
evil beautycrush my sex I since we do a
video together Sammy that one of my
favorite ever youtubers got amazing
youtube channel and websites are linked
or below you will know her but if you
don't we just filmed a video on her
channel so i will link that below we did
our five front of staple accessories so
that was fun and now we're going to be
filming our non a beauty favorites which
I've never done before but I thought
it'd be good yeah I was just a beauty
favorites this is fun oh my dear how in
whatever you like yeah so do i thought i
see as you'll guess right so my first
thing is I've spoken about a camera
before and a non beauty favorites but
this time I've got something new ok so
mine is the Olympus trip 35 camera and I
got this from amazon for about 40 quid
and because recently i've been
interested in going back to the film
photos i think because of the polaroid
then i was like oh I love this so sucks
one yeah so I'm that's so cool that is
maybe look like it should work see you
eyes open yeah again develop it it's
been really cool to go back to back to
the basic photography a little bit but
and I love how it looks yeah that's
really cool ok my first favorite are
down here let me grab them and their
shoes and they all God and the dervishes
they're these white converse and I
absolutely love these they're all white
you know the only members have like a
red line around them I thought these are
a little bit different a bit more like
grown up and I'm obsessive what at the
moments you can see my shirt and yeah I
really like those and other from JD
sports ok my next thing is a clothing
item and this is a big thing for me
because I don't use your an off color
and I will this in a recent video I saw
actually that video this morn ales I'm
really like really nice yeah I felt okay
i found this blazer and it's really
bright bold print I saw his aura in the
sale and I was like oh I don't know it
just fell in love with it even though I
don't usually go for color and back an
80s lit yeah it is like a with floral
pattern with black as well which is good
because I'm usually wearing all black
but absolutely nothing and it's really
comfy and it's quite flattering even
though it's very bright so it's a good
luck transitional piece yes bring it
really is and it is easy cuz you can
kind of we're just playing items with it
because it's such a statement yeah
fightin okay so my next favorite is an
app and it's the vsco cam yeah usually I
think everyone I used it as a photo
editing app and there's not really much
point showing me but that's what I use a
lot I get a lot of questions asking how
i edit my Instagram post isn't at the
moment I'm obsessed with that one it
just makes the setting the filters are
you just make it all like soft and yeah
it's really lovely there's nice kind of
vintage II but not in your face trying
to be vented yeah it's not too
complicated I feel like a lot of the
photo editing apps like so many settings
I just haven't really got time for that
so this is just like a few different
filters different strengths and I really
like it my next thing is going to be an
album and actual no wait this I thought
I know all your favorites is so like
vintage is a camera from the 70s and he
has a record to hear you play he's fine
haha so we have a record player so we've
been trying to I've been trying to like
collect know it build up a collection of
good records and this is a like 21 a
little bit because it's been nice
playing records but also I really have
been loving bonobo and and if you
haven't have you heard a lot of their
music I don't know if I happy and the
music is really kind of relaxing and
like some of its might be so it's quite
cheery but it's hard to explain i don't
even know what the genres betting a
check out bonobo maybe like link
below this cool resident I feel like you
and my dad really ghetto me at home yeah
my dad was a DJ so it has like so many
and then I forgot about them you know
but then leave into that store in SoHo
something like records I got this from a
requisite and the ribs place this on my
own ribs or my next favorite pair of
jeans and I really wanted to have an
alternative to skinny jeans all I wear
skinny jeans and I wanted some like
slouchy boyfriend jeans but then after
trying loads on I tried on the levi
fiber ones I realized they're quite
flattering because they're really Maggie
up here and I'm kind of bigger in my
middle section so I was like searching
everywhere for some boyfriend jeans and
I found these from River Island there
there Ashley's and there's slim
boyfriend so they are boyfriend but
they're slightly tighter than like your
average boyfriend jeans and I really
like them they just look like this oh
and then consider it a bit so I rolled
them up and they just fit pretty well as
if he struggles frying boyfriend jeans
try the ones from River Island not be
color as well yeah I mean I wanted a
light wash they didn't have a light wash
I thought it would be nice for summer
but I like these for now they were like
40 pounds which I think's all right good
I hope so my next thing is a bit of a
geeky thing okay I have this obsession
for mugs I don't really know why yeah
and like you have a good market has to
feel good and I found this one in
Spitalfields market in an install that
has proposed a cool home bits and
periodic table I said I can see but it
does yeah there's only our view that I
remembered AG hey you like I I'm
magnesium yeah yeah it reminds you of
Malibu Breaking Bad Oh seen it how good
you have those regular next masterpiece
a whale ring about her favorite yeah but
I love it it's really cool it's a nice
feel like nice hearty mark
