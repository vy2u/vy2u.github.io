really well today as you can see I'm in
a different setting and I'm with sorry
evil Beauty crush my sex license we do a
video together Sammy that one of my
favorite ever youtubers amazing YouTube
channel and website so I'll link it
below you will know her but if you don't
we just filmed a video on her channel so
I will link that below we did our five
kind of staple accessories so that was
fun and now we're gonna be filming our
Nona Beauty favorites which I've never
done before but I thought I'll write to
you whatever you like yeah so do I see
as you all guessed right
so my first thing is I've spoken about a
camera before and a non Beauty favorites
but this time I've got something new
okay so mine is the Olympus trip 35
camera and I got this from Amazon for
about 40 quid and because recently I've
been interested in going back to the
film photos I think because of the
polaroid then I was like oh I love this
song sucks one yeah
so that's so cool that does look like it
should work see you boys oh yeah again
develop it it's been really cool to go
back to back to the basic photography a
little bit but and I love how it looks
yeah that's really cool okay my first
favorite are down here let me grab them
and their shoes and they all God and
they're dervishes
they're these white converse and I
absolutely love these they're all white
you don't really know guys have like a
red line around them I thought these are
a little bit different a bit more like
grown-up and I'm obsessive all right at
the moment you sleep on it and yeah I
really like those and other from JD
Sports okay my next thing is a clothing
item and this is a big thing for me
because I don't you shoot up color and I
will this in a recent video I saw
that video this morning like really nice
yeah I felt okay I found this blazer
it's really bright bold print I saw it
in Zara in the sale and I was like oh I
don't know it just put in love with it
even though I don't usually go for color
back an 80s lit yeah it is like a with
floral pattern with black as well which
is good because I'm usually wearing all
black but absolutely nothing and it's
really comfy and if quite flattering
even though it's very bright so it's a
good luck transitional piece yes pretty
really is and if it's easy because you
can kind of we're just playing items
with it because it's such a statement
yeah item okay so my next favorite is an
app and it's the vsco cam yes usually I
think every one I used it it's a photo
editing app there's not really much
showing me but that's what I use a lot I
get a lot of questions asking how I edit
my Instagram post isn't at the moment
I'm obsessed with that one it just makes
the Lacetti and the filters are you just
make it all like soft and yeah it's nice
kind of vintage even not in-your-face
trying to be bent yeah it's not too
complicated I feel like a lot of the
photo editing apps like so many settings
I just haven't really got time for that
so this is just like a few different
filters different strengths and I really
like it
my next thing is going to be an album an
actual know your favorites so like
vintage from the seventies any other
record you place finally so you have a
record player so we've been trying to
every time to like collect
know it build up a collection of good
records and this is a like to won a
little bit because it's been nice
playing records but also I really have
been loving bonobo um and if you haven't
have you
the music is really kind of relaxing and
like some of its more upbeat
so it's quite cheery but it's hard to
explain I don't even know what the genre
is Benny wait check out bonobo maybe
like link it down below I thought you
and my dad would really get on me at
home
yeah my dad was a DJ so it has like so
many and then I forgot about them you
know but then we been to that store in
SoHo also make records I got this form
of a quiz in the ribs place
my next favorite pair of jeans and I
really wanted to have an alternative to
skinny jeans all I wear skinny jeans and
I wanted some like slouchy boyfriend
jeans but then after trying loads on I
tried on the Levi's 501s I realized
they're quite unflattering because
they're really back me up here I'm kind
of bigger in my middle section so I was
like surging everywhere for some
boyfriend jeans and I found me is from
River Island there that Ashlee's and
they're slim boyfriend so they are
boyfriend but they're slightly tighter
than like your average boyfriend jeans
and I really like them they just look
like this and then tape it so I rolled
them up and they just fit really well I
say a few struggles flying boyfriend
jeans try the ones from River Island not
any color as well yeah I mean I wasn't a
light wash they didn't have a light wash
I thought it would be nice for summer
but I like these for now they were like
40 pounds which I think so right I hope
inflamed my next thing is a bit of a
geeky thing okay I have this obsession
for mugs I don't know why yeah and like
yeah it has a good market has to feel
good and I found this one in
Spitalfields market in a store that has
two loads of cool whole bit
you can see but it does yeah there's so
many hours here that I remembered AG a
you like I am magnesium yeah it reminds
you of Malibu Breaking Bad next
masterpiece a will make about a favorite
but I love it it's really cool it's a
nice feel like nice hearty my guys
that's not everything - hmm - thanks on
is one I don't with me because I've
eaten it it's fun Whole Foods and I put
it on my blog
it's crispy bacon and maple syrup
popcorn you can probably buy some else
cuz it's I'll put the name of the brand
and link below but it's so good it
tastes like breakfast he's like crispy
bacon and maple syrup on pancakes it's
so good it's like sweet and slightly
salty and yeah I've gone back to me
recently and bacon oh my god like cuz I
used to eat meat but I never really had
bacon and then since my private now I'm
like oh what is this
that's amazing my last thing is I don't
have it with me either because it's a
film I have seen a few good films
recently but um last weekend I went to
sauce why did I start up the film about
it's like a jail film with
what's-his-name okay the guy that is in
skins cook from skin oh I liked cook
it's really really good it's like a UK
film I'm gonna know yeah I guess side
but it's read like acted really well and
it's a good film I think if I was to say
anything the ending wasn't the best part
but
excited to keep it in scrap see that was
there any good so I'd recommend to go
and see it yeah and my last favorite is
TV and it looks not TV my favorite is
from TV and it's Modern Family

recently discovered I have sky and on
demand they've got like box sets of
Modern Family
