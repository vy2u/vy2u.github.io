really nice weekend so far as you will
see I am in a different setting we're
not quite in the flat yet but today is
one of those days where I have to wait
around for deliveries all day West Elm
just came open outfit does it come in
later today so I thought I'd just make
this my base today signed up to the free
open Wi-Fi thing I've got my laptop and
I thought I would film this video so
again apologies this isn't like a makeup
tutorial or anything that exciting but
all my stuff is packed up so I thought
instead I would do an on beauty
favorites because I haven't done one of
those videos in a while and there's so
many kind of non Beauty things I'm
loving at the moment so I thought I
would kind of talk through each one I
love talking about things that I love so
let's get started no that was weird so
let's get on with the first thing I got
given this as a gift as most of you guys
all know me and rich are engaged it's
very exciting no we don't know anything
about the wedding yet for everyone
asking but this was a gift it's from
smite soon I love smite soon and pretty
sure it's how you pronounce it they do
all kinds of kind of stationery and
their little books especially are so
cute they've got like a little black
book of addresses and all these
different things I just always want to
buy them and I was given this as a
presen it's so so nice it's a little
white book and you probably can't see
from there but in gold it says tying the
knot and I love it I'm definitely more
of like an Excel spreadsheet type person
if I were to do that but I just like
this anyway and I feel like I'm gonna
try and be one of those organized people
that has like one of these in their bag
you open up and it's got kind of light
blue paper with lines and then all these
different tabs on the side says dress
etc invitations etc guests and gifts
service reception flowers and other
going away honeymoon I mean this is
seriously overwhelming do I actually
have to do all those things I have no
idea what I'm doing but maybe this will
help me be a bit more organized and know
how to plan a wedding these make really
good gifts so if you're looking for
anything like that for a friend they do
all different kinds the next favorite is
the paint this may sound weird but it's
a brand called Annie Sloan and I haven't
actually used this properly yeah I've
used it on a shelf but it's the idea
that I'm really interested in and really
like I had no I've never heard of this
before my mom recommended it and the
idea is that it's called chalk paint so
you can kind of paint it on
if he wants to paint chest of drawers or
shelves or door it can be quite hard
because you often have to sand it down
and prime it but this you don't need to
prime it or do anything to it it's a
kind of all surface purpose paint and
it's so easy to use I did use it on a
wooden IKEA shelf
I used a grey color and you can also buy
a wax from their website so if you
wanted it to be more like sealed you can
rub some wax on afterwards or you can
just kind of leave it if you don't mind
it getting a bit like lived-in but the
best thing about this company you know
they have a really good website with
tutorial videos and it's just a really
like nice place to buy paint they also
do really good selection of colors just
the sorts of colors you want to buy
there's no like horrible colors that you
always think who actually puts that on
their walls or on their chest of drawers
really nice colors this one's like a
lovely duck egg blue and I've got a gray
and a nice kind of plum color as well
they're so nice and these little tester
sizes which are actually decent size so
I mean I painted a whole shelf and I've
still got half left so I can do the
other shelf another non Beauty favorite
this month has been clearing out my
stuff obviously because of the move I've
been packing and whilst packing I've
been clearing out stuff you guys would
have already watched my video on the Ty
Dean book so I've kind of spoken about
this before but it was just really nice
to play some stuff out I still have way
more stuff than the average person but
it feels cleansing and detoxing and I
think it's really good every now and
again to have a big Clara it definitely
kind of clears your mind and you start
to really appreciate what you have
instead of kind of hoarding too much
stuff I feel like the less stuff you
have the more you appreciate the good
stuff so I've really enjoyed clearing
out and I hope that my kind of clearing
out videos have inspired you guys to do
the same it's definitely that time of
year I always have a clear-out in
September another favorite is my Road
microphone which I'm using now on my
camera so instead of cut away so you can
see it I was really late to the party
with this I feel like a lot of youtubers
use microphones and I always said I
didn't really feel like I needed to my
sound was fine and I didn't have a
problem but this is one of those
situations where I didn't really realize
I had a problem until I started using
then realize that it's not just if you
have background noise and things like
that it's just such better quality sound
and now that I'm in a flat with wood and
floor and at the moment there's like no
hardly any furniture in here so it's
quite echoey it just really helps in
situations like that especially if
you're filming outside the idea is it
just kind of takes the sound from the
front of the microphone so it won't take
sound from the sides I mean this is like
the cheapest one you can get like really
really fancy microphones but I'm really
happy with this one when I first got it
it was making a hissing sound and what
I've realized is that you keep the left
hand you keep the bottom knob all the
way through the left and the top onto
the right I'm pretty sure that's correct
I will show on the cutaway what I mean
and then you don't get a hissing sound
and it's really great quality there's a
couple of YouTube channels that I've
been really enjoying this month first
one is Karlie Kloss she is a model and I
think she's kind of done the transition
from traditional media and like
non-internet job into the internet world
really well she kind of seeked advice
from Casey Neistat who helps produce her
YouTube channel and I think she took
about a year it's kind of pre film
videos and learn about it and get into
the groove because obviously if she's
already very well-known she wouldn't
want her first video to be terrible so
she kind of took time before to prep the
channel and I really like the videos she
puts up they're not that frequent but
they're really good quality and I feel
like she's really been her true self and
you really gets to know her personality
which is amazing for a celebrity and a
model that you know you hardly ever even
see her talk so it's such a good idea
for her to have a YouTube channel and
it's really made me kind of respect her
I just love the style of videos really
so definitely go check out Karlie Kloss
is each karlie classes YouTube channel
if you haven't already I've also been
loving The Late Late Show YouTube
channel so James quarter and he's
obviously an English guy he moved to LA
to host the Late Late Show I had no idea
what the Late Late Show was before we
don't get it here on TV but because he's
English we will kind of embraced it and
their YouTube channel was really good I
wake up in the morning and the clips
always uploaded from the show the night
before and he does so many good sketches
I just really love his humor he does car
karaoke carpool karaoke so he's had
loads of
celebrities where they help drive him to
work and they kind of sing in the car on
the way to work I mean last week he had
Stevie Wonder that is my absolute dream
it was so good to see like the different
personalities of the celebrities he does
a sketch where Cameron bought it's
called he takes someone's job for the
day he lets them go on a break and he
kind of takes over their job and it was
just they're just so so funny and it's
just I feel like it's done really well
and I really enjoy watching the YouTube
clips you would have seen in my vlog
last week that I came across the shop on
Carnaby Street called we built this city
and I just haven't stopped thinking
about it since I love that shop I hope
they kind of change stock often because
I want to keep going back and like
finding new things but you walk in and
there's just prints everywhere all over
the walls and there's like cards and
stationery but I I love a good print I'd
really don't know how I'm gonna fit them
all around the flat because there's so
many that I like so if you're looking
for like a really cool different print I
definitely recommend go in there they
whoever is the buyer they've done really
well because they've got a really good
selection and I feel like they're quite
like London themed as well it was just a
really inspiring shop sorry I'm just
snacking on cherry tomatoes that's weird
isn't it Aoyama okay next up is a
kitchen utensil and another gift that I
received from one of my mom's friends my
mom has had one of these in her kitchen
for so long and I swear she bangs on
about it all the time this is the best
lemon squeezer and I'm like yeah okay
whatever mom and then I used it and I
realized what she meant it is the best
lemon squeezer ever I don't know the
brand name I can't remember I'll look it
up and link them all below but it's a
lemon squeezer and it's in like really
heavy metal you basically cut the lemon
in half you put it in hid in here you
press it down squeeze it and the juice
comes out the holes but there's
something so so good about this that it
actually gets all the juice out the
lemon for like no other lemon squeeze
that has ever got so much juice out and
my friend got this for me and she also
got me the lime and the orange one which
I've never even seen before I didn't
know they did those so here's a giant
one for oranges freshly squeezed orange
juice my fave and a little one for lime
as well which we great for like making
cocktails or salad dressings so those
are really cute and they come in lovely
bright colors to go with their citrus
fruits
okay so my final favorite is my parents
getting a puppy I'm so excited Dixie
didn't pass away that long ago but my
dad literally cannot live without a dog
and he was looking for awhile for what
kind of dog he wanted and he decided to
go for another Tibetan Terrier they're
just such lovely dogs and they're so
good with kids so they're getting a new
puppy and we've been sent some photos of
her it's a girl and she's so so cute
I'll show you some photos now this was
her when she was a tiny little baby and
this is her now she just looks so cuddly
and cute it was a little video of her
like bouncing about that we got sent so
I think she's coming like right at the
beginning of October and we kind of have
a name in mind but I'm not gonna tell
you in case it doesn't stick I'll let
you know her name let me know but I'm
just excited to have another little like
baby puppy around and at least I won't
be living at home this time because when
Dixie was a puppy I swear I was like
scared of her she used to buy it so much
p.m. really looking forward to having a
cuddle with her so those are all my
non-beauty favorites for this month and
I hope you guys enjoyed this video and
that you're having a really nice Sunday
I'll see you on Tuesday for another
weekly vlog and have a good rest of your
day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
