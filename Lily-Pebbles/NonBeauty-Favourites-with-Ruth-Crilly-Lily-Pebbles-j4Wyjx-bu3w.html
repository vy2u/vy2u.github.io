Ruth hi if you don't already know she
has a YouTube channel called or model
recommends obviously she's a model look
at her beautiful so going to go her
channel out today we're going to be
doing naana beauty favorites because
I've already done my beauty favorites
this month and I wanted to talk about
other things I've got a weirdest
connection just seems so it was a really
explosive gone you get first okay should
I start yes I'm so excited about the
okay and you put it on this is a noon
band
what is this crate I am like I'm
massively missing out boots it's loads
of little tiny elastic bands and cool
colors and then there's a loom with
these kind of pegs on it's kind of like
crocheting because I still love
scooby-doo's and I was younger no it is
no they're like long bits of plastic and
you do like friendship bracelets oh yeah
I do remember that I used to mentor them
on holiday and tried to sell them to
people on the beach it was somebody
thing and loved them I really want to
get into this kind of threat yeah
friendship bracelets but my next-door
neighbours friend's daughter Morgan if
she's watching hello he was 11 I think
we were stuck in a thunderstorm and we
couldn't move because he was scared
about being struck by lightning and she
made me one of these oh I really like it
it's only you were like I keep saying is
that my friend's daughter to make this
one for me or my cousin made this for me
yeah no one's made one for me I'm really
jealous
yeah I chose those okay my first
favorite is gonna beat this this is from
wild fox and it's and first of all comes
in this really cute box it's an eye mask
hood it is sleeping man laughing because
I was gonna bring an eye mask right yeah
it was like a padded one with lavender
it's like this such Granny's but this is
it seems ridiculous to buy like it I
must and waffles but if you found these
on they're so soft feel them oh I know
amazing I know more on a flight recently
and you want to make sure you take your
makeup off cause you
there's so comfy and they actually do
help you sleep special plane and it says
let's sleep in which there's one that
has eyes on it but it kind of freaks me
out
I collect them when I fly I've got loads
and loads of the video yeah and then I
stashed them in the cupboard because
it's one of those things and earplugs
that you can never find when you need
them see my mom used to wear these any a
plugs fly and I used to think my gosh
she's such an old person but actually
really does help it really helps me
definitely
yeah I'm converted make leads to amazing
bars they the original ones look longer
like brown yeah I think that's why I had
a lot of lines but these aren't just try
a minute it's a strawberry crunch and
they've also caught up so these like
healthy snacks yeah honey cents vegan
I'm vegan 100% yummy good love your body
mmm have tried oh god it looks very
healthy oh it smells really quite Hilary
doesn't it I mean all these nut
bothering sugar Ian good tears like Sun
already fill you up yeah I get really
low blood sugar I think I must have an
incredibly high metabolism they sleep in
your handbag if I get hungry I have a
window of about 20 minutes between going
oh I could eat something I'm really
wanting to tear people his head so yeah
starving hungry I mean I'm sorry how we
stopped around with me now yeah I did
too but not healthy stop you should my
next favorite are my Birkenstock sandals
and like then Batman version yeah I mean
these are like uggs you love them or you
hate them and they're so comfy and I
kind of like this style of dressing them
they're so comfortable been wearing them
all summer okay this is quite right if
you I'm actually gonna demonstrate them
but not only let me tell them I'm going
to these are to cover your nips when you
haven't got a bra on and you don't want
your nipples to kind be like pink jersey
dress so you stick them over there
like that and you can reuse them again
and again again I've had these I
actually bought them for wearing with my
wedding dress so that was just over six
years ago even to watch them at all
you're supposed to put them on to clean
skin back and then you put them back in
the thing I mean after six years they
have connected a bit of trust so I
gather no one wedge left they were from
Debenhams I mean it's so long ago I
don't know they've probably moved on
yeah do you wear like I mean I can't not
worry about but I would thought you'd
wear like tape or something that's
clever my next favorite is this book
that I read barometer Malta and it's
John Goering The Fault in Our Stars but
everyone and their dog is talking about
and I thought I was a bit of a hype I
actually really enjoyed that if you read
this no is this what everyone's been hot
chucking yeah because he's a you too so
it's not film it is a film only I read
in your book and then turn this one oh
it's really sad like I cried a lot I'm
really glad I read the book first before
I saw the film cuz then I had my own my
marriages at my head that's the kind of
thing that makes me one cried reading a
blog just it's a real quiet okay I'm
gonna water that now yeah it's really
good oh I was gonna do a book yeah but
then I thought I won't because you're
gonna book so I know how to do a
favorite that I've reinstated into my
life three favorite my fire max which I
bought as a present to myself movies on
about seven years ago is the best kind
of presents yes I have a look on that
I'd see how much they are no and they're
ridiculous I'm pretty sure I didn't
spend by right in case you're looking I
didn't spend how much like I know but
I've got really sick of kind of looking
at everything in my iPhone and I quite
like writing lists so I thought if I
just write everything here I don't know
I liked it I liked the hotel yeah so
that's a favorite of the month really
just because I've been using it loads
and it's nice to have solid it's nice
and small as well a lot finer passes are
quite chunky okay I think my final
favorite is one second glasses what is
this and it the brand is charged each
eye
coconut milk it's like chocolate milk
but it's kind of yeah I don't know going
on we can have a little bit of Baba and
some coconut milk that happens whole
thing can I do talk about coconut milk
yeah
does it ever really make you wanna gag
sometimes like when you cook with it no
I drink it coconut water oh I get is it
bad breath there's only one brand I
could drink I hate Vita Coco
cheers Cheers this smells nice what if
he hates it I shook then drinking it
because we're so nervous
Oh like that yeah it's thinner than
normal chocolate milk I find like which
loves thick chocolate milk so many for
sick this is like more like fringe yeah
no I hate you hate those why is it got
two J's oh I really like that yeah
that's very refreshing it is I've had it
in the fridge ready for this video you
could totally make a Bailey's cocktail
yes yes it is very healthy yeah kind of
my thing is you could let make you enjoy
it mate yes how am I going what's the
alcohol in bay leaves
so it's a no-brainer if you like instead
I'm gonna leave this up like so stupid
and the shook I wore this to the team he
pastors months ago and everybody was
like oh my God look brace it's so
sparkly look at those diamonds 69 pounds
no way I think it's brown called Atwood
and soya it's a nice fake diamonds
basically but like vintage style and it
really would know and no one would carry
that that's really nice and it really
drops nicely down onto your hand you
know like it when you're doing stuff and
doing a girl of wearing a bracelet with
a watch and they like 50 my last
favorite is the Ed Sheeran album that
I've mentioned before and you guys all
corrected me it's not called ex it's
called multiply I was wanting to know
that what is it it's an X but it's not X
it's multiplied like these last albums
plus I've probably got that wrong as
well anyway I love that album I listen
to it every moto like the whole time it
was obsessed listen to every song and I
really liked it
that one there's one that's really
captured it goes round round in my head
well the single from the album notes a
single from the album yeah yeah okay
let's go through them have a look
give me one how does one go run away run
away yeah well anyway they sound very
nice so it's a really good app I don't
have to go that one move yes you should
I think that's everything it's mine I'm
so hot I always get hot when I feel
manners yeah it's really hot in here yet
like 500 like I said we don't look close
together but we're literally sitting I'm
almost on your lap I'm not very close so
anyway we filmed a video booths channel
as well at which we get a little bit
smelly doesn't really make sense when
we're talking about yummy smells so go
and check the video we did on her
channel I will link it below hope you
