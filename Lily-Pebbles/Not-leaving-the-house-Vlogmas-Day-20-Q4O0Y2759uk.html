morning anymore it is quarter to 2:00 oh
my god
me and Richard literally just needs to
see on the sofa all morning I've been
editing my video and my Wi-Fi is
completely broken on my laptop so I've
been on the phones at Apple for two
hours trying to fix it but I think it's
working now so I'm just uploading
yesterday's vlog and I had to wash them
straight to my hair because I want to
film tonight so I need fresh clean hair
which is just heating up some soup for
lunch and I'm gonna finish up my video
and then get ready and I think we're
gonna go see my sister but today is a
very chill day tonight I'm hopefully
gonna film like two or three videos in
front of my Christmas tree so everything
much is going on today
but it's nice to have a chilled well a
chilled work.he Saturday so this is what
meeting for lunch we don't really know
what the soup is my mom keeps making it
it might be some kind of cauliflower
vegetable soup but it looks yummy
and some bread dip in oh and did I say
we were watching Annie
Annie's on TV the original one and I
loved it rich has never seen it so I've
been making him watch it it's just the
best songs I love like the classic
musicals I'm not happy about so we make
thing rich said is Annie dead now which
is horrible no she's not dead I just
googled it her name's Eileen Quinn and
this is what she looks like now how
funny is that that's grown-up Annie okay
Annie is finished and Santa Claus is on
wait when was this film released 1994 oh
my god I thought it was old like plastic
film favor right yeah I love this film
we're gonna go to my sister's we've
changed our mind we're just gonna stay
here I'm kind of worried that I'm not
gonna have anything to blog today
because I have zero plans
apart from filming videos later but well
let's see what happens might be a short
one I'm gonna add my up in calendar
whoops they fell asleep now is nap I've
just got the worst headache guys I
thought mine that would help the husband
I've just taken some medicine
what's the paracetamol so I'm just gonna
relax and I need the headaches guys I've
got a lot of filming to do tonight so
I'm just gonna chill out this is what my
photos of me page looks like on
Instagram I always look at this to see
when you guys tagged me
cuz there's like rookie photos and stuff
always get these saw photos always I
think I probably have too and then I
have to say photo options not me and I
go through an idea about five of these a
day I swear look wait there's another
one what is that that's not me oh
there's so many brookie photos is
amazing yeah I feel really bad then I
was wrong with me but I'm gonna set us
up for filming cuz I really need to get
these videos done I'm gonna film in
front of the tree so I've got my camera
and lights here and I need to go put
some makeup on now I love watching Lisa
Eldridge videos while I do my makeup
they're so calming and soothing and I
swear they make me do you wear makeup
Bella
okay I'm gonna film my video now so when
you watch my December favorites at the
end of the month you'll know that on
this day I felt really ill like I'm
gonna be sick and my interactive bottoms
not really wearing proper bra so I'm
gonna show my scrapbook like right at
the end of the video so when it's on
don't forget to wait for that I'm gonna
get filming now and my favorites all in
there weren't sure you properly I put a
little list
hey December favorites done the main
parts done now I need to film the
cutaways and a bit where I show you guys
my scrapbook for the close-up photos I
like to change back to my kit lens
because it's just easier to focus with
and so I'll kind of hold the products
here in front of the camera how the tree
is like a blurry background just so you
guys can see the products properly scrap
that idea of holding the products cuz my
nails are bit chipped I'm gonna put them
on this chair and with the tree in the
background and I've had to put a little
DVD in there so make a flat surface okay
it's time to switch batteries this one
is dead I'm gonna go put those files on
my Stern or hard drive because I'm
always so worried about losing them off
taking so long to film then I'm gonna
like breathe for ten minutes and film I
am 2014 favorite song bit nervous about
this one though I feel like there's some
pressure to not forget anything and I
always do
okay this is my list of favorites will
quickly show you and here's my box of
favorites quickly show you I'm gonna lay
them out on the floor so that when I'm
doing my video I can just have them in
order and pick them up and after rummage
through the little box so I'm just
laying them out in order now brother
I've changed my top not to try and like
fool you guys into thinking I didn't
film all these videos in the same day
just because I think you'd probably get
bored of seeing me in the same talk my
makeups the same then yeah I just like
nearly passed out and feel like I'm
gonna be sick so after lying down I
convinced rich to come and help me film
he's just gonna pass me the products and
make things be easier for me I just want
to get this done laugh
oh my god I can't believe I just managed
to do my 2014 favorites I'd keep stuff
here a team of rich was so handy like
help him how handy helping help it's so
helpful handing me handed me all the
products oh I just hate that video comes
out alright I'm sorry if I seem like
moody in it I'm just literally on the
verge of being sick I'm now just doing
the close-ups here and Rich's helping me
thank you
then I'm gonna tie my hair up and get to
my pajama set my makeup off and I'm so
excited before dat I've I def it's a
good idea for me to eat Cory I'm gonna
try a little bit and see if my body
wants to eat it or not oh my god I'm
done I'm so happy
probably worked on my December favorites
my 2014 favorites now all needs to do is
the intro and outro of mine easy video

up in the 11th of January I'm so happy I
feel terrible though we've got our Thai
