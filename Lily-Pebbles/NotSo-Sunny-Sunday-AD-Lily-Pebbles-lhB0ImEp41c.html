it's a bit of a gloomy day in London
I've planned film like a summer in
London video today but the weather's not
great summer in London is very
unpredictable I think it's meant to get
nicer later today as you could probably
hear I'm not that well I got back from
France last night I had such a nice week
away it was so nice to have a bit of a
break but I think my body is kind of
getting me back for having a break and
I'm really not very well today
so the weather plus not feeling great
has really kind of got me down so I
think the plan today is for me and rich
to go out and just try and lift the mood
do a few things to make me feel better
some nice things around London so I'm
just gonna do my makeup and then I'll
take you guys along with me today
I think the plan this morning is to go
to Columbia Road flower market I've
actually never been which is crazy I've
lived in London my whole life is the
absolutely beautiful flower market and
I've always wanted to go it started
raining though which is a bit of a
disaster so I think we're gonna make a
detour and grab some breakfast
and then hope you about somewhere down
the rain would have stopped and we can
go check out all the beautiful flowers
breakfast was absolutely delicious add
avocado on toast
okay you can tell that we're near
because I keep seeing people walk down
this road with flowers and everyone
looks so happy to get their flowers I
want to go pick some nice ones you
excited yeah I think you actually are
because we haven't been perfect okay
we've just arrived so bring on lots of
montage pretty flower clips
that definitely cheered me up there's so
many beautiful flowers loads of like
succulents and the smells were
incredible and I bought myself some
hydrangeas they were doing like in three
four ten deal and they're so so
beautiful I had to go back yet philip's
this because I forgot and I love this
stuff so I think they look nice mixed
together we just got let off a parking
ticket this comenzar a great day the
parking ticket man was very friendly we
said we genuinely didn't know that we
couldn't park on a single yellow on
Sunday he said it's caused us by the
market and he didn't give us a ticket so
what a nice guy we're now gonna head
Starbucks because the lovely people at
Starbucks that she gave me and Richard
some vouchers to go try out their new
Teavana range which is the iced teas
everybody's got in the car and just got
a seriously hot so it's like perfect I
mean we're gonna go try out a couple of
the flavors let's get this one so we can
share and hopefully they'll be very
refreshing so we're just heading to
Austria now
goodbye please these are the Starbucks
pavana shake and iced tea I got the
BlackBerry Mohito flavor and you've got
the peach dream-team peach green tea
lemonade yeah all my life I love
standard iced tea in America get it
everywhere and in the UK it's so hard to
find so refreshing like this yeah oh
that one
I've stopped flavors as rich as I really
like the peach green tea lemonade and
he's having the blackberry heat so I'm
gonna go for a little walk around the
shops now and I want to take a picture
with the flowers
we're at an area now could Camden
passage with some really cute little
shops I think we're gonna have a little
walk around while I finish my iced tea
nearly finished actually
it's way past lunchtime we got very
distracted by flowers and iced tea so
we're gonna go get some pho I could do
with a big bowl of comforting soup so
we're just gonna head over there now
lunch was really yummy and now we're
heading back home because I want to
chill out on the sofa I really enjoyed
going the flower market and everything
we've done today is definitely I'm glad
that I went out and didn't just stay in
if he put me in a much better mood and I
feel better
I put my flowers in a VARs and they look
so so pretty I love the mix of the blue
and the pink and I'm really into you
flip them and I just think it's so cool
so happy to be home had a really nice
day out and we're gonna chill out now on
the sofa and watch the men's Wimbledon
