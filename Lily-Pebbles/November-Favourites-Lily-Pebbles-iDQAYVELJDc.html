favorites so first up is of course the
nail polish and this month I've been
loving nails Inc Victoria which is
actually one of their hero shades it's a
really deep burgundy plum and I've been
loving wearing these kind of nail
polishes all month but especially this
one nail think it's really easy to get
hold of so I definitely recommend this
one but in general these kind of shades
for the winter I've just been going
crazy over next up is a blush and it's
actually from Charlotte Tilbury new
makeup brand I love her makeup and she
actually it sections them into different
looks and this blush it is from the
dolce vita look which is one that really
suits myself skin tone and hair color
and I really like her blushes this is
what they looked like so they have a
kind of neutral shade around the edge
and then a pop of color in the middle
and I really like that because it means
you can use it a few different ways you
can switch your brush around the whole
thing and get a mix or if you just want
the lighter shade you can use that
outside if you want to brighten up your
cheeks a little bit use the pop of color
in the middle and I really like these
they're really good quality they feel
really nice they last well in this color
which is ecstasy really suits me and I
really have been enjoying it this month
so next up is a perfume and it's not
often that I find a new perfume that I
love and I fell in love with this one
instantly it's from I hope I pronounced
this brand right because I have a really
bad French accent Maison Martin Margiela
something like that I mean this is from
their replica range which is basically a
range of perfumes that tries to
replicate familiar scents and memories
and this perfume is called lazy Sunday
morning which is just amazing it's meant
to smell like a lazy Sunday morning when
you wake up and your sheets smell of
fresh and I love that so this really
does smell like that if it's so hard to
explain the scent but it's quite floral
and compared to most my perfumes but I
really like it so I was really fresh and
clean and kind of soapy but in a nice
way and I've been wearing this everyday
and asking my friends and family doesn't
suit me and they've all said yes so it's
become a new favorite for me I love the
packaging in this kind of really cool
apothecary
is that the word bottle mine's a bit of
ESOP style I really like this so if
you'd enjoy wearing this pretty much
every day this month next up is
something
from Avon and I've actually never really
tried makeup from Avon before because I
thought that you just had to buy it from
consultants which I did really want to
do but they've actually got an online
shop as well which is so easy to browse
and buy stuff from so I'm going to link
that below and this is their mock a lot
a true color eyeshadow palette and it
looks like this it's just the perfect
Brown neutral eyeshadow palette it's got
four shades and they're all numbered one
two three four to makes it so easy to
know how to use it shade one it's really
good as a highlight in the inner corner
or under your brow you can even wear it
all over your lid to is just a matte
light brown so it's really good for the
crease or under your eye three is a
slightly shimmery taupe you Brown so
that's lovely all over the lid and then
for is a darker matte Brown which is
good to smoked up for an evening look
it's just perfect it's a really good one
to travel with or if you're going on a
weekend away I've just been using this
everyday because I kind of love to faff
around with my other eyeshadows and this
just has everything I needed so onto my
next one I was recently in top shop in
Oxford Circus and I noticed that they
now have a beauty Mart in their beauty
section and for those of you who don't
know beauty Mart is a really cool little
kind of beauty shop with hand selected
great cult beauty products especially
international policies that are really
hard to find so they've got Bioderma
and products like that a really cool
Japanese Korean beauty products as well
and I saw that they have this which is
homeo as mean I'm probably pronouncing
that wrong as well and this is a French
pharmacy brand product and it's
basically all-purpose balm it's good for
chapped lips it's good for itches burns
grazes one of those kind of Elizabeth
Arden 8 hour creams but I actually don't
like the 8 hour cream so I thought I'd
give this a go and it's amazing I
haven't really used it on my itch is or
burns or anything but I've been using
this on my lips and it's so good it kind
of instantly smooths them out and gets
rid of any dryness and it's kind of like
magic and it doesn't smell weird or feel
weird or anything like that and it's
also really good if you have like dry
patches around your nose if you've had a
cold it's great it comes in a really
handy little tube that you can just
throw in your handbag so definitely
recommend trying this if you can get
hold of it if you live in France it's
probably really easy to get hold of but
in the UK it's quite hard but I'll link
somewhere online where you'll buy this
so next up is a mate
item from the body shop which isn't a
brand I talk about much but I've
recently been trying out some of their
makeup and I fallen in love with this
which is their honey bronzing powder in
shade 0-1 and it looks like this I
really never thought I'd use anything
else apart from NARS Laguna by gift gave
us a go and I really really love it it's
good if you have slightly paler skin
because NARS Laguna is quite dark and
this is slightly lighter but it still
really gives a nice definition and a
nice bronzy glow I'm wearing it today
and I think it's called the honey
bronzer because it's got this kind of
honey imprint which is really pretty
it's just really nice it feels nice on
the skin it's easy to use and I've kind
of fallen in love with this a little bit
okay so my final product is from this
works and it's the deep sleep pillow
spray and this has become a permanent
part of my evening winter bedtime
routine and it sits next to bed and I
love it only ever had the small one
before so I recently got the big one and
I love this it smells like lavender and
chamomile and you spray it onto your
pillow I don't spray it directly on I
just kind of mist it above and let it
fall onto my pillow and it smells
amazing rich hates it so he's always
like what I'm spraying it I love it and
it helps me just relax and zone out
before I fall asleep because my brain
goes crazy at night ins when I think of
all my ideas and I find it's so hard to
fall asleep so this code just helps me
relax and clear my mind and it smells
smells so good it smells like a really
nice love and a bath or like a spa
reminds you of kind of walking around
French markets it's just lovely so I'd
really recommend this so those are all
my November favorites I can't believe
that the next time I'll be doing a
favorites video it will be my 2013
favorites where and this year gone it's
ridiculous I'm gonna do my 2013
favorites in two parts and they'll be
coming to you right at the beginning of
January so look out for those but thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you guys in my next video bye
so soon as my autumn style guide video
went down so well I thought I'd do
another one for winter so it works just
the same I've got three category</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
