my November favorites I can't believe
this is the second to last favorites of
the year I actually don't normally do
December favorites but I'm going to do
them this year I'm going to have a
December favorites and a 2014 favorites
so I'm looking forward to that but today
I'm just talking about the things I've
been loving from the last month in
November I've got beauty favorites and
quite a few style favorites as well I'm
going to start with the most
budget-friendly and I have been loving
this dry shampoo it's the new dry
shampoo from colab and it's by my friend
Ruth curly and this is such a great i
shampoo there's a range of different
sense I really like London which is
along with the black lid and the song
which is New York which is fruity
they're so affordable I quorum how much
they are something like three pounds
it's crazy and they do travel minis and
it's a really good dry shampoo it's
definitely not as white as most other
dry shampoos that are out there it
doesn't make it your hair feel too dry
and chalky it does kind of get rid of
the grease you do need to use quite a
bit i feel like because it's quite
subtle but it doesn't give that horrible
dry feeling that most dry shampoos do i
absolutely love this i think they did a
really good job i think my next to
favorites won't come as any surprise
because i've been using these a lot in
recent blog posts and videos and it's a
Tom Ford cream eyeshadow in spice and
the Max Factor excess shimmer in bronze
these are both very similar so this is
your high-end version and this is your
drugstore version it's a creamy
eyeshadow that I like to apply with a
brush once it sets it doesn't move all
day and this one in particular is the
most gorgeous kind of grungy plummy
shade and the Max Factor one is really
great as well I would recommend them
both so it just depends what your budget
is but I've been wearing these like all
month they're so easy one shadow does
all you don't need to spend ages with
powder eye shadows blending this one
just all over the lid blended out is so
gorgeous another product that I featured
quite heavily this month in my videos is
the Charlotte Tilbury matte lipsticks
this is part of her mat revolution range
and they're so nice there Matt and
long-lasting but not at all dry and they
still look luminous and feel kind of
light on the lips I absolutely love the
packaging it's beautiful and my favorite
shade is love Liberty which is one that
I never would have thought that I liked
oh I just realized that I picked up lost
cherry I like this one too this is like
a pink but love Liberty the one I really
like and I used it no I didn't use it
makeup tutorial but i think i was
wearing it in a couple of recent videos
it's like a dark berry but it looks very
different in the tube than it does on my
lips so I'd recommend trying it if you
can get to charlotte tilbury counter the
formula of these is just so different to
any other matte lipstick that I've tried
and I love the square shape of the
bullet it makes it so easy to apply if
you are after a really good matte
lipstick I would recommend the Charlotte
Tilbury one hundred percent now then
we're approaching Christmas I'm all up
for the glitter nail polish I don't
really wear it much all year round
because it's such a pain to take off but
i like to use as a top coat if you don't
put it on so thick it is easier to
remove and the 1 i'm loving at the
moment is by SE and this is called
summit of style and it's a really
different type of glitter than I what
I've seen when you first look at it you
kind of assume it's rose gold but next
to the rose gold well it's actually more
of a kind of a bronze glitter and it's
so pretty I've layered it over SE
soulmate which is kind of like a
burgundy and it looks so pretty just one
coat so it's not like full glitter it's
just like a sprinkle of glitter and I
think it looks so pretty perfect
Christmas and every time i take my nail
polish off i just want to use this again
I thought I just want to use any other
polish because it's so pretty I didn't
really like that I haven't actually
mentioned this brush in a favorites
video yet which is crazy because I've
been loving it for ages now it's the
Bobby Brown full coverage foundation
brush and I use it in all my makeup
tutorials so you've probably seen it
before it's really great like small
travel sized brush and it's basically
like the Real Techniques buffing brush
but a high-end version i love the
buffing brush but i do go through them
quite quickly because i find that if you
use it every day and you wash them like
weekly eventually they do start to kind
of fall apart a little bit but i think
that is a great brush but if you do want
something high end if you're Bobby Brown
fan this one is a really nice brush
definitely to wash you can always tell
what it needs washing because it gets a
little bit dense but I love this it
gives really nice coverage for the
foundations really easy to use and it's
great for traveling for skincare I've
been loving these facial radiance pads
from first aid beauty and again i can't
believe i haven't mentioned these yet
I've kind of nearly finished them
there's not that many pads left in there
i've been using them maybe two or three
times a week for a good few months now
these are basically soaked in lactic and
glycolic acid and they're great for
exfoliating so you just need to take one
pad i like to put it all over my face
turn it over you
other side don't waste them and it
really exfoliates and just leaves my
skin feeling really fresh especially
when I'm feeling a little bit spotty
these work really well I then like to
use a lot of oil or moisturizer
afterwards but when my skin's feeling
dodgy these have been really great and
yeah I'm a big fan of the packaging as
well and how they come on pads is very
easy to use you can get this from feel
unique and actually really affordable
for this kind of product the final
beauty favorite before I go on to my
style favorites is perfume from Tom Ford
if you followed my blog you would have
seen that I went to the counter and
selfridges to have a little kind of
fragrance consultation is free for
anyone to do just need to book in and
the lady was so helpful at the counter
and she basically talks you through all
the different scents and ice not every
single Tom Ford scent and this was the
one that I picked as my favorite it's
called white suede and it's quite
different to anything else like own it's
very fresh smells like clean linen
sounds like the cozy Sunday morning it's
really really pretty I think it would
work all year round it's not very
Christmasy I have to say but it's so
easy to wear and fresh I feel like it's
so offensive and I think a lot of people
would like it and look at the beautiful
bottle it's just gorgeous I think Tom
Ford scents are a worth investing in if
you want a perfume as a gift they are
expensive but the quality is amazing
they last a long time in your skin and
just smells so fresh and not at all
artificial ok so now on to style
favorites and the first two things I'm
wearing them both and have been wearing
them in pretty much every video for the
last month first of all is a ring from
Astrid mu or a stratum are you not sure
how you pronounce it it's a website they
do beautiful jewelry and this ring is
just a really simple gold band with a
little black gem and this is part of
their stacking ring so you can get a few
different colors and stack them together
or I like to wear this little black one
just by itself is so delicate I hardly
ever find rings that fit me because i
have really skinny fingers but this one
fits perfectly and it's just really
elegant and nice to add to an outfit the
second favorite is also jewelry and it's
this necklace i've been wearing and I've
had so many comments I have linked it
down and then all the down before my
videos but you guys always comment
saying where's your necklace from this
is from kate spade i did buy in new york
it came in like you
packet is very small I'm not sure if the
UK stores do it yet i don't think it's
on the website they basically have every
different initial i obviously got the
one with l and it's a really simple
little gold necklace i think it was
about fifty five dollars maybe i just
think it's so sweet i've been wearing
everyday kind of goes with every outfit
it's so easy and i really like it and
glad i got it the night trainers that I
picked up in America have also been my
favorites this month they are just so
comfy seriously if you have not got back
into trainees yet since the 90s you need
to do that these ones in particular so
company they're flyknit lunar 2 they
look like this and they literally feel
like you're walking on clouds when I
wear them i wouldn'ta like meeting the
other day because I was like I don't
care don't need to wear heels I just
wanted to be comfy and as you think
because they're black they can look
really smart if you're wearing a smart
outfit and a nice jacket in a nice bag
then I think the whole training thing is
quite cool these days and it can work
they're just so comfortable i love them
they were definitely worth investing in
okay my final favorite is some pajamas
and these are from next they look like
this the navy with white stars i got
them in a large so they're pretty huge
but it's basically a long sleeve top and
then kind of loose trousers they are so
soft i actually don't know what they is
made out of Lamela they're not even a
hundred percent custom but seriously
guys these are so soft i can't even
explain they're so comfortable and
they're breathable i love them so much
that I've actually asked my sister to
get me the ones in gray for my birthday
I think we're going to go for the medium
next time though because the large are a
little bit baggy for me I've been
wearing these so much and just lounging
around in them i'm so into Landra at the
moment whenever it's this time of year i
just want to wear cozy clothes all the
time obviously i'd love to buy
everything from the white company but
next is a lot more affordable and i
think these are really nice pajamas i
can't wait to get them in gray as well
so if you are looking for new pajamas i
would recommend these ones from next ok
so those are all my favorites this month
i hope you enjoyed seeing all the bits
that i've been loving check back
