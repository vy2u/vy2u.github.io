favorites video and for this month I
thought that I'd do it with rich all
right good we haven't done home together
for ages and I didn't have that many
favorites this month so I thought I'll
do half rich and video half I might have
a few more than you but you have some
favorite singing yeah do you wanna start
sure I'll go first or all of them no not
all of them just wanna know one you
going yeah I'm gonna start off with so
I've always been I've been trying so
many different deodorants and roll arms
and sprays and nothing really worked
nothing lasts for the full day so until
Lily introduced me to this is the
woman's one that's the one that I use
but the main equipment which is called
Mitchum like ultimate 48-hour fresh and
what's really cool about it which I
notice about any other ones is if you
could discover this one hasn't been used
yet but it's got like the little holes
this is like the cream one where the
cream comes out the holes rather than
the stick which is in the whole cream
Cup yeah so it's like a kind of cream
but then it dries really nicely it
doesn't stay another thing loads are
doing it Roland's I don't understand
it's ruined my shirts and t-shirts don't
understand it that one boys right so
this doesn't this is a nice natural
smells good
lasts long time and I love it
bye ran out so that's why I'm using this
women's one as an example my first
favorite is one that I mentioned in my
underrated products video so I won't
talk about it much because I've already
told you but it's the Kiehl's
cream with silk groom I think you'd like
this as well as Shea I should let you
try it it's a cream for your hair
basically and I like it off just
straighten my hair it's a bit fluffy
which is not now one has really greasy
now but when it's fluffy I just put a
bit of this in my hands and it kind of
just binds all your hair together and
gives it a bit of hold and texture and
it's great I really really like it so I
can use it as wax you could maybe just
use it when your hair's kind of damn
alright let's try it behold it's your
next fave my next phase is my these
headphones wireless headphones from
denim I got them last year for Christmas
from my parents and I've kind of been on
and off running and in the last sort of
month or two months I've been really
right like focusing on my running
getting that back up to scratch
just because of the weather so I've been
using these and these are brilliant
they're really cool yeah lets you try
and do that I'll do like a closer no I
won't figure out so you just put them
like that yeah but in yeah in there
connect do you think I got this so you
press the play button that turns it on
yeah and then you connect your bluetooth
for your phone and then you can play
anything you want all the music Spotify
use all of that that's genius
and it also has a phone button so if you
want to call me what I'm running fine I
can press that done that's a really good
idea for a Christmas present actually if
you're looking for something for a guy
oh yeah
these were 60 pounds ok my next favorite
is a makeup brush and this is the
multitasking brush from look good feel
better and this is amazing I used it for
my foundation today but it could also
work for cream blusher or contour so
many different things which is why it's
called a multitasking brush and I really
really like this I recently actually
became an ambassador for look good feel
better so I'll talk about that properly
in another video but I will leave the
link to their website down below it's a
really amazing charity and recently me
and Anna went to go and experience one
of their master classes and it was great
it was really really cool so I've been
loving using this brush and I used it
for my foundation today what makes it
multitasking because you can use it for
foundation and blusher and all different
Queen products because it's like certain
shape it's like slightly narrow but it's
like quite densely packed you use it all
different eye cream products that's what
makes it multitasking learn something
new every day
yeah next one and I'm happy wait not
YouTube is that he's talking when he's
down here looking for his products next
one is I can't physically show you
unless I get logo which you can
do here now
what is it sons of anarchy oh god love
that program please been watching this
every night for like a month yes like so
noise it's got action it's got
motorbikes it's got like lots of killing
and deaths and fighting and of sex and
everything you need amazing if maybe one
go get a Harley Davidson I just want a
Harley Davidson one is cool
I literally couldn't even explain what
it's about I have no idea all I know is
rich has been watching it non-stop you
did like how nice is another seven in
how long did you five seasons in like a
month
that's maximums so you done that yeah
Reese add really good edge recommend it
yeah
recommend it not like up there with
Breaking Bad and those types of series
but it's just below I think and only
loved it
I feel so we're talking through my like
makeup favorites with you here isn't
really boring for you I'm gonna do it
quickly I just learn about the
multitasking thing oh yeah exactly
yeah and so this one again I think I use
this in my November makeup tutorial so
you guys know Xena H&amp;amp;M of makeup now Wow
and it's really good so this is the
bronzer I love it it's like a matte
bronzer it's not too dark or orange II
it's very pretty
and I've been using this like every day
this month that's all I really have to
say about it because you've seen it in
action no it's like 399 or something
goodness it's really really good that's
why I'm recommending it in my face
alright you might check you that is it
really good yes rich really they came
alone for clothes I know but they do
beauty now there it is really good my
next favorite or I went down is this is
not problem my monthly favorites I don't
go through things I might want my
favorites and he picks out things that
like his lifelong favorites and like no
they've had this bag for three years so
I'll do a separate clip and it's like
this so this is I got this about two
years ago when I started training for
the London to Paris trip ride the mock
and I did and I needed a bag that could
hold about 30 liters worth of stuff acts
as a cycle bag but also as a running
back so I can use it for runs when I run
home from work or when I run to work and
I didn't want to spend stupid money on
my cuca turn my 200 pounds on the back
I don't want to do that so I found this
on wiggle this deer it's good dhb it's a
brand and it's the bag so it's like 30
meters and its got like straps okay
really comfy I use it for London's
parrot or and I use up all my rides and
it's lost me for two years and it's
still smells a bit funky show a really
black bag it's got lots of goodies your
word okay
videos got laptop compartment it's got
side compartments with vents it's got
front compartment it's got strap for
your helmet if you like cycle to work
can you need your work stuff yeah I put
so I can fit my laptop my notepad my
clothes to change into like shirt
trailers shoes and also like a towel as
well all the small coats everything okay
I think they get it it's a great bag
I'll try and find the link on Google my
next favorite is an eyeshadow palette
and last month I had the busy arteries
yeah the last month that had the Vizio
op matte eyeshadow palette in my
favourites and this is another matte
eyeshadow palette but I feel like I'm
very late to the game with this one and
I love it it's from the brand tart which
is an American brand you can't really
get here Michael taught like with an e
on the end and it's the tarts lips
palette which is all matte eyeshadows
there are twelve twelve eyeshadows all
mattes a lovely range like plums and
browns all very wearable and I have been
using this a lot all over the lid in the
crease everywhere okay my next favorite
is the nail polish that I'm wearing now
and Anna asked me what my no crush was
the other day and I said I'm pretty sure
it's SC cocktail bling she was like
that's definitely not it
Essie cocktail really kind the kind of
conversation you have Nelvana she
wearing lynnie it's definitely not the
SA anyway it is I'm pretty sure they've
changed the color because it's way more
purpley and bluey than
used to be used to be more gray anyway
I'm loving it I have one of the kind of
newer brush types they're not really
that new anymore actually
and I love it everyone compliments me on
this nail polish when I wear it
it's bluey gray and yeah been wearing
that a lot this month okay my next
favorites again I won't talk much about
because I recently filmed a video about
new Beauty launches and I've had to move
it around so it's actually coming later
but I've already filmed it that makes
sense and I go on and on about this
range so you can wait for that video to
find out more the Brian is called I
think it's kite press or I really need
to find out how to say this name because
I I used this product in my monthly
makeup routine didn't know how to
pronounce it then either but I basically
have been loving the oils how would you
pronounce that key priestess key press
press maybe and I love all the products
that I've tried there's like a clear in
serum and glowy serum and these two of
the oils so this is the elixir 2 which I
haven't agreed my smell the NYX of one I
don't love the smell as much but the oil
is incredible it's got a thousand roses
in this oil but the smell reminds me of
this is such a weird thing it reminds me
of one needs to do Christmas school
fairs and my primary school do you know
what that's roses no it doesn't smell
like roses musky smell yeah it's kind of
musky because like my school anyway it's
an amazing amazing oil I just put it on
I'm like oh actually you should try it
what does it do makes your skin go I
already skin no rich has this obsession
with having oily skin as we garibaldi
skin and oils people with oily skin can
use oils you'll sense what it is you use
all these extra cream products on it
tell me what to do then the beauty
person
I can't show it physically here but I'm
guessing the Liddy will do like a
cutaway cutaway and it's of duty so when
I on Instagram a couple of weeks ago I
put that picture up where I was gonna
build that coat rack yeah I actually
built it and did it I never thought I
would basically can I do the back story
we needed we have like no we're not that
fur coats and there's one little area
behind door but it's such a small space
you couldn't find any coat racks or
anything the wall is that secure enough
to hang something and we wanted a
clothes rail but they're all too wide so
rich had a good idea of just kind of
find you the material
yep so I went down to like a big burly
steelworks
place and said I want to build a coat
rack and they all laughed at me and then
one guy actually helped me and we put
together all the measurements and we
figured it out and the next day sent me
all the materials really heavy and then
I built it how much do you pay to pay
for the cost me it's 80 pounds in total
okay
for ya everything and it was the
brackets of the most expensive bit and
it's all like adding key as well so it's
all allen key bolts so you can take it
apart put it together so yeah I might
put on eBay rich no gladness I think I
should make them and sell them like I
read it that you'll make much money on
that if you have to spend 80 pounds
you'd have to mark up and he's gonna
spend that much clothes right any people
with weird awkward spaces in their flat
if anyone's got a weird awkward space
and one apparent spend 150 pounds
whatever mark up make a profit these are
the business conversations that we have
at home okay my next favorite is where's
my phone
it's an Instagram account and I really
can't remember who recommended this to
me I feel like it was another youtuber
and I'm really sorry that I can't credit
you but the can't remember who it was
but the the Instagram is could paper
boyo and basically how I even told you
about this man this guy who cuts out
little on little pieces of paper
pictures and then holds them up against
real life images and that's really hard
to explain I'm gonna put a few on the
screen here this is the most recent one
that I love of a mum giving her daughter
gift and he's put it in copper Gardens
that's a little paper cutout whoa and
then look rich you'll love this one of
the bike and the I've seen the lego man
there's like Lowe's embankment
oh yeah look the bike in the london eyes
whoever it's so cool you like hosing
them out of things a bottle with a ship
in it is amazing I go and look his
