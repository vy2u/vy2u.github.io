for you today and I'm sorry that I
didn't do September favorites I can't
remember the last time I missed a
monthly favorites but I was a little bit
busy at the end of September getting
married you would think that I'd have
double the amount of products and stuff
to talk about but actually in September
it was such a write-off I really wasn't
like using anything I wasn't trying
anything new I didn't want to break out
so actually this is kind of just October
favourites and as usual I'm doing a mix
of beauty style tech random food I'm not
even gonna put categories in I'm just
gonna go for it
and I'm gonna start with the beauty bits
that I have sitting next to me here this
is by Estee Lauder and it's the global
anti-aging wake up balm to be honest I
don't really know much about it because
this got sent to me and I kind of lost
the press release but I don't think you
need to know much about it because I
tried it and I loved it it's like a bomb
but it's really illuminating and it
really does like brighten up your skin I
tend to use this either instead of my
moisturizer or I apply it kind of as a
primer before I do my makeup
it really does like hydrate and
moisturize the skin but it's got this
amazing kind of pearly luminous finish
to it I think the name wakeup balm
perfectly describes it so I've been
using that pretty much every morning
this is from wave is this kind of new
hair brand everyone's talking about I
picked up a few of their products
actually I forgot it in the bathroom but
I really like their shampoo they have
like a clarifying shampoo clarifying
shampoos basically get rid of any pull
up build-up if your hair's feeling
greasy but most of them strip your hair
so if you've had a Brazilian treatment
or you've had color they're really quite
damaging for your hair 'we do one that
isn't damaging it's got like no parabens
or anything or sulfates in it so that's
amazing I haven't really seen that in
any other brand
so actually I'm really enjoying that
shampoos in my bathroom but I'm also
liking this hair oil I tend to use this
on wet hair I find that when I use oil
on dry hair it just gets a bit greasy
but when my hair is wet and I've brushed
it through instead of using like a
detangler or a cream I use this and I
just run it through my hair and I find
that my hair dries naturally much nicer
when it's got oil in it as well it
doesn't dry as frizzy it dries a bit
more like the bit more weight to it and
then once I straighten it it's so smooth
and this is definitely helping with
condition of my hair because of the
change of weather my hair is so dry I
literally went like that the other day
in my hair just like pinged off it just
broke so I have to be very careful with
my hair in the colder months and I think
this oil is really helping the Tanya
burr lipstick she's brought a whole new
range of lipsticks and most of the
colors aren't probably to my taste but
there's one color called pink Coco
marine it's a day I've been wearing it a
lot recently I really like it the
packaging is cute it's just like a gold
it's pretty standard buy somewhere
friend Lucy the other day apply her
lipstick and use this as a mirror genius
that's changed my life because I lost my
mirror for my handbag so this is the
color of the lipstick as you can see I'm
wearing it now is just a very easy kind
of pinky but not too pink pinky nude
color this is a sort of color I've been
obsessed with for like six months I
haven't worn red and so long so really
like that it's just like a creamy easy
to wear formula she said for her first
range of lipsticks she didn't want to do
like an old format so she just bought
out the formula that she thought was
easiest to wear and I think it's really
nice and comfortable on the lips I also
have a perfume here this is from Jo
Malone and it was one of my wedding
fragrances so I actually did a
combination of two and then we also had
a scent for the barn which was also a
combination of two I'm gonna do a whole
blog post on it which will explain all
the sense that we used to kind of send
the venue and scent myself and rich
water fragrance as well they were all
germ alone but one of them that kind of
ran through everything was nutmeg and
ginger so this is one of the fragrances
that I wore and it was also this was
spritz around the venue and spritzed on
the linen and it's so nice I would never
ever think to try it in store nutmeg
yeah don't we know that smells like
ginger not really fan of the smell of
ginger but it basically smells like a
spa specifically a cowshed spa you've
ever had like a treatment in cowshed it
really reminds me of that it's so
calming it's so nice I'm really glad
that actually I tried a different scent
for my wedding because now this will
always remind me of the wedding it's
just it's such it's curse may be
slightly masculine which I like in a
fragrance and the other one I wore kind
of lifted it and made it a bit more
fruity and girly
oh it smells so good just go try it
smells like a good-looking man having a
spa treatment basically the last Beauty
favorite is the Kylie cosmetics Kai
shadow and I'm sorry to any of you that
hate the Kardashians and I didn't want
to put this in a favourites but I really
liked it it was a bitch to get hold of
expensive I had to pay even more when it
arrived you know the deal I wish they
were easier to get hold of but they're
not anyway this is what the palette
looks like I've done a whole blog post
on it so I will link that below it's got
more photos and details of what I think
of it but this is basically what it
looks like and it's got nine eyes
shadows in it a mix of a few kind of
shiny ones and mainly maps but really
nice warm toned Browns which is what I
like and I've been wearing this in most
of my videos recently in this video my
video that's coming up in autumn one and
in my haul video you guys will commented
on my makeup and I'm wearing it today
it's just like really nice a really good
quality some of them I think that one's
got like too much fallout for me but as
long as you just tap off the excess I
finally blend really easily they look
really nice on the lid this one in the
middle myself Mac all that glitters I
really like it so sorry but I actually
really like that I'm not going to talk
too much about this this is my style
favorite of the month but I've got it
coming up in detail in a video soon it's
from Rhys it's a gorgeous bluey gray
suede jacket I've been wearing this to
death it's beautiful but I have an
autumn styling video coming up where I
talk about it more and I'll show like
proper cutaways me wearing it so just
wanted to mention that as a favorite but
moving on this was a wedding gift from
my sister Carly and my brother-in-law
Ben and it was really thoughtful and I
absolutely loved it and I wanted to
mention it because I think it's actually
a really good idea for other people if
you're looking to buy someone a wedding
gift that's maybe like off list it's
risky to go off list because there's a
reason why people make lists but if you
want to get something more sentimental
this was perfectly done I feel like
buying someone something in a frame is
risky because if they hate it they have
to put it on their wall but this was
less risky basically we had a lovely
girl hood Olivia Whitworth do all of our
wedding stationery for us again I have a
blog post coming up all about that but
me and Olivia I have created this design
together I told her I won
she came back with sketches it was like
a back and forth and this same design
went through everything the save the
date the invite the menus the order of
service so what my sister did is she
contacted Olivia I have no idea how she
even got her contact details she
probably broke into my email contacted
Olivia and got Olivia to make using the
same design for my invites she got her
to make a framed piece of the poem that
Rich's sister read at our wedding which
was danced by Paul Hayward he didn't
think he mean anything to us but we all
said to do a reading he suggested a few
things and she actually found this and
said that she loved it so we just wanted
her to read something that she loved and
she did it so well by the way so I love
this because it's a way of keeping the
memory of the design and the invites
without framing and invite would be
weird so she's got a friend in like a
white IKEA frame and it looks like this
I hope you can see so this beautiful Riv
design with the hanging light bulbs and
the hanging Lantern this is what we had
pretty much on our invite and Olivia and
my sister kind of did it to size and
then Olivia hand wrote this beautiful
poem here and I love it I just love it
put it on our kind of little shelf thing
in our lounge and it's such a nice
memory of the wedding so that is
definitely a favorite this month of
Olivia's growing her handwriting so nice
my next favorite you might have seen on
my Instagram my Instagram by the way is
at Lily pebbles
it's our West Elm bark art we actually
use that at the wedding we had like a
pimp your Prosecco stand where you could
like add berries and cordials to your
Prosecco and we use this West elm bark
art so after the wedding we bought at
home and we've put it in the corner
we've definitely had to move the bin
into a bit of an awkward position to get
it there Rich's like this is the worst
use of space ever but I think it's a
great use of space we now have endless
amounts of alcohol leftover from the
wedding that we've kind of put in the
bar cart we've made it look pretty and
it just looks so nice it's quite
frustrating our flats so small that we
don't really have space for like
decorative things but we've made space
for that because it's so beautiful and
so worth having so now we have a bar
cart full of alcohol and we're not even
particularly big drinkers my next
favorite I don't actually have with me
because I ate them all but you may have
seen in my vlog if not I'll put in the
footage now the Panda
natural licorice you can get these in
most like health food stores Whole Foods
like a random health food store near me
that does them I first discovered them
because my sister gives them to her to
my nephew I think a lot of kids get them
because they're kind of rights sweets
but they're not particularly bad for
users like their unsweetened there's no
nasties in there and I really enjoy
snacking on though I hate black licorice
but I like red licorice and the
raspberry and strawberry flavors of the
Panda ones are really nice so you just
get like a stick of licorice and those
have been my favorite snack over the
month I got a new phone this is the
iPhone 7 plus I don't actually normally
get that excited about new phones but I
woke up really early and saw the height
and I was so tired that I just ordered
myself but I've been thinking about it
so it came and actually I really liked
it I got it in the goals I haven't got a
case yet which is making me a bit
nervous I just can't decide on a case
because I thought I was going to get the
battery pack that Apple do they don't do
it for the plus and I'm gutted because I
love that battery pack so I'm trying to
decide what case again hoping I don't
drop my phone in the meantime but yeah
it's really nice I've got a little
picture of me and rich they're getting
married I've put on my eye ring on the
back and I actually got a new eye ring I
got a marble one from Amazon they kind
of do them in all different finishes
really so I got a nice marble one and
this helps because I'm not used to the
size of that I set the seven plus this
actually really helps like me hold it
better and have a stronger grip on it I
love this eye ring thing yeah I haven't
noticed that much of a difference
I definitely love having the big screen
like when I'm watching videos or looking
at instagrams it's so nice to have the
big screen I don't know I would go back
to the small iPhone I'm really happy
with the plus the camera quality is
really good I think what made me want
the plus is the two cameras and to be
honest I don't really use zoom that much
I feel like it also loses its quality
but the camera quality is amazing on the
server and the camera is great and the
size is great but I am really enjoying
that there are two things on TV that
I've been loving
we just finished narcos season 2 it was
so good I would really recommend it I
know that some people struggle with the
subtitles but you do get used to it the
only problem is you can't really do
anything else whilst watching it like I
was making dinner and rich had to read
out subtitles to me and he was trying to
do it in a Colombian accent it was quite
but I feel it was so good we really
enjoyed it it was so like the ripping we
just wanted to keep watching the next
one straight away and I'm pretty sure
there's gonna be more it finished some
like a little bit of a cliffhanger so
that's been great I've also loved
mission selfie which is a series that
was made by Ben Brown and Steve Booker
who are friends of mine and youtubers
they kind of did it with a lot of
friends of theirs who produced it and
filmed it I think at the time they
didn't know what they were gonna do with
it but they sold it to the BBC and it's
on iPlayer and it's brilliant it's not
too dissimilar from watching a YouTube
video it's not like over highly produced
or anything basically the idea of
mission selfie is that they want to
encourage people instead of taking
photos of themself to turn the camera
around look at what you're looking at
and just experience life which I
completely agree with and it's so
important to me which is why whenever I
do fancy videos I'm never in them
because I love looking through the lens
and looking at things I don't want it to
be all about me and they're going to
like a different place around the world
I've been think that's five episodes so
far I've watched all of them and I
finish watching it just feeling so
inspired that I want to I've already
booked into like the Jessup's level two
photography course because it makes you
want to go out and take photos of
beautiful things and learn how to use my
camera better and know me to want to
travel and experience life and I think
it's great I think Ben and Steve did
such a good job so that's on iPlayer if
you want to watch it so those are all my
October favorites I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video please don't forget
to subscribe thank you so much for
watching and always leaving lovely
comments but we'll see you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
