I had my camera with me and I thought
why not
so I'm starting the vlog a little bit
later I'm in the gleam office and I'm
here with Anna she's back from LA and
New York and it's so nice be reunited
ain't even my straightener yes we are
we've got a meeting room from so we've
been in for an hour ten o'clock and what
this means you until 12:00 we're going
to be working on some stuff and then
I've got a lunch and I'm getting my
nails done a new place later so yeah I'm
just going to flock and see where it
goes wrong we didn't wrapping up our
little work working session now and
we're going to lunch at place Booker T
and founders neither of us have been
four so we said that we really want to
look at the menu first because sometimes
when you go for meetings you're like hey
and catch it up how are you and then I'm
like wait I need to concentrate menu a
to a bit rude so I'm gonna like pre-lit
but it's a huge menu if you found
anything yet we're going to go hand over
your mother's I just read truffle Mayo
and I was like well cuz I hope you can
accessorize you guys feel like it's
really weird to decide what you're going
to eat before you even go to a
restaurant I've totally decided we know
for there's fish do John's and skin on
fries I was saying how I always want to
order from the kids menu and that's
basically like an adult's like fish
fingers what are you going to get at
this painting also let the lovely Anna
pick me up some bits from
glossier when she was in New York very
excited I already have a choice over the
skincare bit when they first first
launched I really wasn't that impressed
but since then they can launch makeup
and I've heard very good things so I was
like just get me whatever you think I'll
like please are you a give us direction
oh we don't know Hispanic does like
throw me anything
Oh literally everything was let me show
you what she got comes in a cute little
pink it is bad like part of the reason
if you love them you can buy these at
Canyon for like three twelve dollars or
something insane that's very funny and
so the first thing is this cloud paint
seamless cheek color it's all ER than I
thought very cute all packaging and it's
basically liquid
liquid cream blusher and cream blusher
basically this is in the shade dust and
I tried out my hand I would find these
things quite hard to control they spread
like around a lot it's highly tiny
amount so that looks very cute this and
I was like you need this Taylor scope
view effect highlighter this is like a
thick cream highlighter comes in this
pretty packaging and and it's like it's
kind of quite a cool I see highlighters
a bit less kind of gold than I normally
go but it looks quite like subtle in a
nice way
zoom out be nice if more does like gloss
speed then it is like most people this
is the stretch conceal oat I just love
the name of this Anna always raved about
this it comes in a little pop and she
got me the shade medium and I think it
looks perfect we weren't sure that it's
going to warm I didn't I feel like it
still look quite orangey dead when you
actually forchick I like watched it in
the shops and I was like all that yet
you know like perfect I'm really love a
good concealer and it's like to try that
that's the yummy lunch I had my first
cousins and they were great and is now
heading back to being from eating I'm
going to go pick up my bag and then I'm
going to get my gel manicure removed and
replaced stuck and dry and everything
therefore I hope you may do some kind of
like nail art looks like a bit more
interesting maybe like a baby pink
I don't know color well and I might go
check out Maria Tosh to see how much the
areas that I think they're too expensive
to us I kind of just want to replace
these with sonic knife and now having to
duck and dry which is basically behind
free night the men vendors of risk and
by opposite surface excited to get this
polish for me
what's so good and I can smell when I
get home I'm going to talk to you guys
about the difference team we nailed it
which turns up and dry and drive I
because I thought basically to support
to troops for Maria - of the plane
rose gold band and then a rose gold band
with little spike on it I put them into
me because I knew it too quickly for me
today at home talking about I've come
back to glee Nana still in her meeting
but I'm going to go through my peer box
all the best to go through guys look how
sweet this is this girl food Alessandra
she's an illustrator
she has an Etsy shop which I'll link
below she she saw that I was looking for
more prints my Excalibur and so she
created one with my wedding jo Malone
wedding bento nutmeg and ginger and
blackberry and BAE and she drew a
picture of them and I absolutely love it
that's so so lovely thank you so much
agony maja this is hilarious I didn't
know what these are behind you they like
to make a snapchat spectacles and music
was film snapchatting like searches of
videos or something I'm going to try
them out when I get home I thought I
ritual understand them better than me
it's a little bit later now I went back
to gleam and I did my emails and stuff
and then I got on the tube and came home
and I've just been sitting on the sofa
and reading all of your comments because
my video just went live so let me show
you a better look at my earrings really
hard for can't see you so in focus
veneer so this middle one is just a rose
gold one of the smallest tips with a
little pointless little stud and then
this one's just plain so happy with
those and my manicure I got pink so I
told you that I would explain the
difference that I found between dry by
and duck and dry it's not actually duck
and dry it's nailed it they just it's
like a confession they're just hosting
themselves be hosted in duck and dries
I'm going to call it nailed it enjoy bye
okay the different similar to and it's
like if you want gel if you want to gel
manicure in central London because they
are right next to each other dry by is a
nicer venue like don't this kitten Elsa
and the seats are really comfy it's very
common they're all the ladies have a
little outfit like it's luxury and
whereas nailed it
there's just a really
small nail bar with only three seats and
you're kind of up in a plastic seat and
it's definitely not as enjoyable to sit
there I saw someone having a pedicure on
earth again like really awkward
positions so in terms of like confort
DRI by definitely get a point in terms
of like friendliness I found that the
the girl the girl I had it nailed it was
so so friendly and lovely and she did my
manicure super fast it was like the
option to have a full-on manicure but
they do cuticles and stuff or just a
repaint she was really really friendly I
think I felt like I had a better and
more enjoyable time in terms of
friendliness at nailed it so they get
appointment and the main difference is
that if you want a gel manicure and
drive by there's I don't want likes a
number in case it's wrong I feel like
there's like 20 there might be more
there's a certain amount of college you
could pick from I wouldn't say it's like
the biggest selection whereas nailed it
there is literally like hundred shades
you can put form and if you want to pink
there's like every shade of pink every
shade of blue there's even glitter gel
there's like holographic gel there are
some crazy colors like amazing amazing
in terms of picking the color as I feel
I could drive where there was like an
orange and a nude I quite liked and that
was about it
yeah I think that's the main difference
throughout the car remember the price
difference but I'm sure if you have a
look online it was safe so I just got
home
I need to edit Sunday's videos like 7
and 7 o'clock which has phoned me to say
that he's just getting on the tube to
come home and I think he would like me
to start some kind of dinner so I'm
going to try and do that and then my
friend Deb's is actually popping around
she want some advice from something so
it'd be nice to see her about it for now
I kind of want to have a chilled evening
because I've got a busy day tomorrow so
I'll catch up with you guys I think
maybe on Friday I'll speak to them good
morning everyone it is Friday today it's
the end of the week and bank holiday
weekend coming up so that's pretty
exciting this week has been exhausting I
feel like we're not all used to five-day
weeks because there's been so many for
day weeks but it's been good to have
that extra day to get stuff done always
get mascara here Charlotte Tilbury
mascara
always starts by smudging and once I
wasted time and I've got a few things to
do today
first thing is a really boring like
financial meeting I basically have like
hundreds of pages of forms to fill out
and I am incapable of doing them alone
something's I'm good at life and filling
out financial forms and not one of those
things it's like doing a school exam I
can't understand a word of it so I'm
going to get them to help me fill out
those forms tonight I've got such a fun
evening planned me and my friend Hannah
are going to see Sister Act live
basically Sister Act they seem to feel
like a church you like sit and watch the
film which I love on like a huge screen
while at 35 piece live gospel choir sing
all the songs so our ministry I
literally can't wait I'm so excited so
I'm going to vlog today so that I think
I can take the weekend off it's aces
birthday party and if you guys remember
from last year my BBA before he had that
big party in let's forest he's doing
that again so they I'm just going to
enjoy the weekend with my family and
then start vlogging again next week
because remember I'm doing two vlogs
week in May I've been to my boring
financial meeting filled out some forms
and then I went to my parents because
they just got back from holidays I went
to say hi and just got home and whenever
I'm near my parents always pick up sushi
sort some yummy sushi here probably
won't either so now I'll save some place
to buy put some spicy tuna rolls
cucumber Maki pickled cucumber and
salmon sashimi I wanted to give you guys
a quick update if you follow me on
instagram you would have seen me talking
about the new Canon Watney Canon 5d Mark
4 if you're into cameras this might be
interesting for you if you are not just
fast-forward I know a lot of my youtube
friends wanted me to talk about this I
use the Canon 5d Mark 3 which is a great
camera there's no need to upgrade SLR
cameras all the time the whole point
verse larger when to invest and keep it
for a very long time so usually I
wouldn't even be thinking about it but
there are some differences which really
intrigued me and Canon very kindly lent
me the camera camera to try they also
lent me the 24 to 70 ml lens which I
have fallen in love with I've only ever
used
fixed lens before the 50 ml which I love
the filming but terms of taking photos
this is so much more flexible I've
already decided I definitely want to
invest in this lens it's brilliant it's
so wide it's like literally opening your
eyes for the first time so that's great
but let me quickly talk about the
difference between the mark 3 and the
mark 4
the main difference in terms
like speck I'm not going to go into
expect details but if I select this is a
review from the point of view of a
youtuber there's Wi-Fi on the new one
and the reason why Wi-Fi is really cool
on a camera is because further when you
take photos you can instantly get them
on your phone which is great for
Instagram think about that you just are
like imported into your computer edit it
send it back to your phone
it's so fast Wi-Fi also really good
because at the moment because this
camera the Mach 3 doesn't have a slip
out screen when I'm filming myself if I
want to look at myself and check them
and focus and that I like what I look
like I have to connect my camera to my
laptop rest it on a table with a lead
whereas because I don't have Wi-Fi I can
sync it with my phone and I can
literally use my phone as a monitor and
I see my face which just me is so much
easier especially if you have a single
space that don't need the table and a
wire and a laptop and I kind of really
see on that spot with my phone I can I
get really close that's what really made
me want to try this camera so in terms
of like photos and everything this
camera is amazing the new one and love
it taking photos it's definitely an
upgrade although I still think the
marker is great but yeah it's amazing
since Rossa of course it is
Canon make their cameras primarily for
photographers over videographers that's
for sure in terms of video this probably
wouldn't be a problem for most people
who aren't youtubers but for me I need a
cameras that I can film myself on
without any help the first thing I
noticed about this new camera is that
it's got autofocus when all cameras have
autofocus I don't work who is a
continuous autofocus where the lens is
constantly moving and focusing on all
different thing like if it was a moving
object which would be a good thing I
think if you're a videographer but for
me it was a problem for two reasons one
is quite distracting if you guys are to
watch my video and focuses clumsy going
in and out you would hate that
also you can hear on the microphone
which sits on top of the camera the lens
that we focus in like going to so I
obviously turned that off it's called
like servo AF turned off and I found
that once I turned that off my remote
control or my phone wasn't letting me
focus on my face what I like to do is
focus on face and then leave that focus
s the whole camp for the whole video and
it wasn't letting me do that and I've
been speaking to Canon
back and forth trying to figure out a
solution and I think it turns out that
there is a solution it's just a bit
clunky it turns out that the app that
you use on your phone like Canon camera
Connect you can turn off the servo air
and then you basically use these arrows
to manually focus it so you kind of
moving the lens manually like yourself
like left right left right until you can
see that you're in focus which is great
that it's a solution although I kind of
wish I could just DoubleTap my face and
focus and be done which is what you can
do with the mark 3 so I'm still thinking
about it I don't know if that would get
on my nerves or if it's worth it for
being able to use my phone as a monitor
I just wish that these sort of cameras
had youtubers in mind when they were
being made like so it works for everyone
because I think a lot of people now film
themselves it should be encouraged to in
terms of weight actually let me see I'm
going to hit the lenses off the mark 4
is lighter oh it's all so I feel like
the grip the grip is different the grip
is definitely smaller it feels a bit
smaller not like a massive massive
difference though it's still like a big
SLR on once you put the lens on it the
Beast
I really like the shutter sound on the
new one though it's a bit more like
clicky anyway that's my mini camera
review the Wi-Fi is great the focus
thing is frustrating also another
solution to that would be to let it do
it auto focus thing you can change the
sensitivity of it and I wear a little
mic here for the sound of them picked up
but I don't want to wear a mic here so I
like that so like not YouTube style to
profession I've got a camera for another
week I'm going to see how I get on with
it from a bit scare some videos on
others because last time I tried the
sound is messed up and I've not got time
to that I forgot to vlog again last time
I filmed I was eating sushi by myself at
home but without her oh no whenever you
hit heads what I see it was nice I see
you on a Friday you maybe maybe laughs
the other thing your blog you're like
honey incision and I was like baby went
yeah I went to see like a week at hard
like I've been traveling all around play
but I'm now getting out the tube at
Whitman station and I'm the hottest oil
curly-haired friend
and it should be here waiting for me my
poor dad station good old bender way too
nice and my granny had friends how cool
is this love London right and in a we're
going on there guys look at this oh my
god so many seats and the film's going
to be shown on the screen and then it's
going to be a gospel choir here singing
all the songs I mean excited is
understatement
I think Hannah's ours a little bit too
hard that was very but he's got home and
I forgot to carry on vlogging because me
and Hannah were just catching up we went
for dinner it was really nice but since
act was so good it was actually much
better than I thought it would be the
venue was amazing and huge and the choir
were just incredible I it made me want
to join a choir I really want to I love
it I love like gospel music and they
were incredible singers and obviously
it's like an epic film and at the end
they sung the song from Sister Act - it
was so good it was so fun so I'm really
glad I went in took Hannah I'm going to
get to sleep because it's half 12 past
half past midnight and I've got an early
start tomorrow so hope you guys enjoyed
this log I'll see you for another vlog
