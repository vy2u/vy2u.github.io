feel like it's been a while since I've
done like a sit-down video I don't know
where I've been I've been uploading
wedding videos I've done some collabs
and vlogs so yeah I feel like I haven't
said hello for a while if you are new to
my channel please don't forget to
subscribe
I normally upload around 2 videos a week
but I think in December I'm going to be
uploading more I'm not officially doing
vlogmas this year because I have quite a
few projects on I don't want to kind of
take away from those so I thought I'd do
like vlog less instead of vlogmas which
basically means I'll vlog whenever I can
hopefully there'll be loads of logs but
I just don't want to commit to every
single day because when I do that that's
all I can focus on and I want to be
doing some other things at the same time
today I'm going to be doing a first
impressions slash review of the new
Olympus PEN camera if you guys follow me
on Instagram my user name is Lilly
pebbles or you read my blog Lilly
pebbles Dakota you K you would have seen
that I went on a press trip with Olympus
it's the first time I've met any of the
team and it was a really great trip we
got gifted one of the new cameras I'm
very very lucky and we had a couple of
days to play with it and learn how to
use it I am such a kind of tick camera
geek so I find things like that so
interesting and fun I love cameras but I
have always been very loyal to Canon so
this is kind of interesting to try
something new just a little disclaimer I
am NOT a professional photographer I am
definitely not a tech reviewer on
YouTube so forgive me if I miss out any
information or if this wasn't as helpful
as you thought it would be but I thought
it would be good to have like a first
impressions review from someone I may
have a bit more experience than your
average person but I'm not professional
and I don't know I just thought this
would be helpful this is the first time
I've ever tried an Olympus camera and
I've always been intrigued by the
Olympus PEN wood I bought it if I wasn't
gifted it may be actually it's
definitely something I've considered for
a while I just feel like I have so many
cameras that it's hard to justify buying
more but there was definitely a space
for this in my kind of camera collection
so this is the box it came in it is the
new Olympus PEN EPL 8 so this is the
most recent update as you can kind of
see from the packaging of the box I
think the design of the Olympus PEN is
always what
really appealing to people it's very
much targeted at the blogging industry
at amateur photographers bloggers people
who kind of want to get into it more and
they've always followed trends Instagram
which i think is what made the brand so
appealing and it's very clever marketing
as well so going on that theme of kind
of image and looks I'll start by talking
about the design and the look of the
camera so this is the EPL 8 it comes in
three colors black white and then like a
brown and silver combo all cameras have
this kind of metal and then leather here
or leather look I don't really know what
it is the design of the camera is very
cool it's very kind of retro old-school
style and I think that that's great
because one of the things about cameras
are sometimes if they're really ugly or
bulky you kind of wanted to put it in
like a camera bag or put in your hair I
can hide it away but because this camera
looks great you know you're happy to
have it hanging on your shoulder or in
this case on one of their kind of long
leather straps which I have which can go
crossbody which looks great and it's so
easy to carry it's really lightweight as
well which I like because one of the
reasons I can not take my big cannon 5d
out is because it's so so heavy I'll
talk about the other cameras I use in a
moment and try and compare it to those
but let's stick to the look of the
camera for now so it's a metal and
leather kind of combo really retro with
all the kind of buttons up here and it
has a flip out screen which i think is
really appealing some people this one is
a bit strange it flips up but then it
stops there it doesn't flip all the way
up so that one is good if you are taking
a photo from down below and you need to
see what you're taking a photo of it
then pulls out oh gosh wait it's just a
bit I never really know how to do this
you have to pull it down okay so then it
pulls up and that's good if you want to
take a flat late photo so they've really
considered the sort of audience that
would take a flatly photo or something
for Instagram so you can position the
camera directly down whilst looking at
the screen and see when you're taking a
photo of and then the screen flips down
so that's what they call like selfie
mode if you want to see yourself the
problem I find with this is that often
when I'm
in myself or filming something I'm doing
I'll rest the camera on a table and
because the screen flips down you can't
do that I really think they should have
made it so that it flips up it just
makes so much more sense I'm not sure
why they did that I would love to ask
the design team why they chose to flip
it down to me that's just like a very
obvious thing to do so that's a little
bit frustrating if you wanted to use
this to vlog I find that that's quite a
big kind of con when it comes to the
camera but yet design wise that's pretty
much it it's really not that heavy which
is great and and now I'll talk about the
camera itself I use the Canon 5d Mark 3
this is what I'm filming on now and
there's no way I'm going to compare
those two cameras because they're not in
the same league and on the same family
they're not supposed to be compared the
Canon 5d is a professional camera people
use them to make films and TV ads and
it's a completely different thing so I'm
not even going to compare but I could
compare this to some of my other cameras
the camera I use for vlogging is the
canon g7x mark ii and this is what I use
for vlogging this one you can't change
the lenses on so on the Olympus you can
change the lens and that's a massive
selling point especially when it comes
to taking photos and because if you
really get that nice depth of field you
can just play around a lot with the
settings and do so much more so I don't
tend to use the canon g7x photos i don't
think it's good enough i recommended it
to my friends for their wedding list for
honeymoons and holidays if you're just
getting into photography and you want
something basic this is great but I
can't use this for filming I really like
this because the screen flips up it also
flips down if you wanted to do that
fancy thing but I tend to just use it
flipping up to film myself I like this
for vlogging because it's very compact
and small if I show you the difference
between holding this and holding this
this this is a lot harder to hold in one
hand and maneuver smoothly so although
you can definitely vlog on this I still
prefer this vlogging just because the
style that I vlog in I'm very quick
moving the camera around and at the
moment I still really like using this
for vlogging but in terms of photo
taking you can
pair the Olympus PEN would definitely
win I haven't talked about prices yet so
the canon g7x is about 560 pounds and
the Olympus PEN is about 500 pounds so I
definitely think you're getting a better
deal with this because it does a lot
more I could also compare it to the
Canon EOS m which is a camera I bought a
few years ago they've definitely updated
it and changed it a lot now I think this
is about similar price five hundred and
something pounds this one you can change
the lens on so it's a very similar idea
I don't know if it has a flip-out screen
now my one dozen I didn't love this
camera I just felt like the quality
wasn't good enough maybe they've updated
it now I can't confirm that but this
version that I have doesn't compare the
Olympus PEN I don't think it's as good
which is a shame so let me talk more
about this camera as I said the lenses
change I've only tried it with this lens
on it which is the one I think it comes
with the 14 to 42 millimeter and it's
okay the lens isn't great I feel like if
you're good at photography and you can
get the right angles and the right focus
you can take some really nice shots I'll
insert some photos now that I took on
the press trip that I went to and as you
can see some of the macro shots that are
really close up are amazing whereas some
of the kind of portrait ones I feel like
there's not enough blur in the
background but that you can change with
a different lens so I'm really excited
to try some of their other lenses there
are a lot of settings going on and you
can do so much more than just kind of
point and shoot with this camera if you
kind of take the time to learn the
settings you can change the ISO you can
change the f-stop technically it can do
what SLR cameras do you just have to
know how to use it so there's definitely
a lot of options there one of the things
I found with this camera is that the
screen is really not good enough quality
I find that I'll take a photo look at it
on the screen and think that's actually
not that great and then when I look at
it on my phone or computer the photo is
actually so much better than it looks on
the screen so that's something to bear
in mind and definitely something I think
they should improve on in the future
another massive selling point of this
camera is that it has Wi-Fi and that is
great for so many reasons it's really
easy you just download an app and you
sync your camera to your phone you have
to do it once and then it's really easy
you can just take photos and then
check into your app and you kind of sync
them on a Wi-Fi you don't need Wi-Fi you
just use the camera's Wi-Fi it's kind of
complicated but it's easy once you
figure it out and then you can get all
of your photos in your phone which means
you can email them to people you can
upload them to Instagram you can kind of
check the photos you've been taking in
better quality because you can't really
see it on the screen and I find that's
oh so helpful I love that and it's a
massive selling point for me
the screen is touchscreen which I don't
really tend to use for settings as much
but it's good if you want to focus on
certain things I think this camera is
great I think it's amazing for taking
photos you can definitely vlog on it
I'll insert a clip now where I tried it
out last weekend couple of weekends ago
with Anna I tried logging on this camera
I just press record and it zoomed really
far in but I'm going to attempt to vlog
on this camera so you can see what the
quality is like and it's a little bit
uncomfortable to take little Airy yellow
we look what yellow is it is definitely
heavier go mark run right on up yeah
okay how'd you feel about the screen
being on the bottom I'd hate that really
it's as flattering to look below the
lens and it's look yeah it's from the
double time I'll be interesting to see
if the footage she really looks too vain
yeah AHA I didn't have it on filming
mode I had on aperture so this time it
doesn't zoom in also just feel tight
right here yeah and it's really nice
that is true very nice little field and
like you can touch the screen to press
reward you don't have to like guess of
the button is on the right I put my
hands
correctly it's definitely something that
would take a bit of getting used to
I'm not I just don't know how I feel
about vlogging with it yet I find the
camera quite heavy and just harder to
maneuver but if I wanted to make like a
slightly fancy video I think it could
definitely be done on this and it's nice
and I can take photos on this and film
on it and both would be good quality I'm
really excited to try out there 45 mil
lens which is a bit like the 50 mil on a
Canon and just play around with the
settings more I'm trying to decide
whether to take this camera with me on
my honeymoon or my big camera the Canon
5d is obviously better but it's big and
it's heavy to carry around and it's also
quite difficult to use that you really
have to know how to use that camera
where I feel like this was much easier
for beginners they'd really thought
about their audience as well and they've
put out lots of accessories to go with
the camera so they're like really
stylish camera bags they've got this
long leather strap which you can wear
like crossbody almost like it's a bag
and it's so comfortable and it makes
carrying the camera so easy it also just
comes with like a normal strap but I
really do like this leather strap I'm
trying to think if there's any other
questions you guys might have but the
best thing to do is probably leave a
comment under this video and I'll try
and help you out if I know but I've only
had this for a couple of weeks I'm going
to keep kind of giving it a go those are
my first impressions about the camera I
think this is a great present for
someone that's like into photography I
don't know if people spend that much on
Christmas presents I definitely don't
but if you do this is a great Christmas
present I'm gonna link the camera down
below in the description box I also have
a tab on my blog that says shop and on
there I've got a tech tab which I tend
to put all the kind of equipment that I
use on there if I can I really hope that
was helpful in some way thank you guys
so much for watching I don't know if I'm
allowed to be doing this little teaser
but me and Anna have a very exciting
announcement next week that's all I can
say but I'm really excited
so we'll be uploading videos on our
channels together to make that
announcement so stay tuned for that
thank you so much for watching I'll see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
