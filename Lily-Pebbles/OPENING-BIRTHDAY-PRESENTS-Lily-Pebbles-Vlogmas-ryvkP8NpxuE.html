with me
you
hi everyone today is Friday the 9th of
December I didn't have to look at my
phone for the date today because it's my
birthday so I am 29 today which is
exciting I don't know I feel bit funny
about 29 honestly I think 30th is like
something to look forward to like a
milestone 29 just feels a bit like
nothing in like last year in my twenties
is a bit weird really but it's nice to
have a birthday on a Friday although at
the moment I'm just home alone I've
woken up to an empty flat because
obviously rich works I'm gonna get some
work done this morning and then I think
I'm meeting my family for lunch
I basically round together everyone who
works for themself which in my family is
a lot of people so I think I'm going for
lunch with my sisters my mom my
brother-in-law
and my dad so that should be nice I
think I've got some birthday cards in
the kitchen so I might get open those
now oh look I've got lots of cards which
has laid them all out for me and I think
this is a present from him I don't know
whether to wait though I'm not going to
see him till dinner and then maybe after
dinner who wouldn't know I just put
myself in for a blow dry at the dry buy
because my hair suddenly got greasy and
I hate washing my hair on the weekends I
hate wash my hair all the time but on
the weekends no I have not got time for
that so I put myself in for birthday
blow-dry later
waking ceiling
present year which I think it's from
Rich's parents because his sister boots
down earlier in the week yeah it's one
of these like hanging okay so I wanted
one of these I hope it's not too heavy I
wanted one of these to hang like here
it's quite big mmm that'll work we'll
try and make it work I'm going to open
rich as present he said he didn't mind
but I waited or not so I've got nothing
else to do right now part from boring
work super cheesy card but I bet he
really loved the first card that says
her birthday to my wife I know him so
well I tried to find the cheesiest wife
card out there and this will be the
first of many I'm so intrigued as to
what this is because it didn't ask for
anything and there really is nothing I
want or need so I'm very intrigued
it's a Kashmir gray beanie from
Anthropologie
oh my god I'm going to try this on right
now very excited about this I'm going to
do some work and I'll come back to you
guys in an hour
I'm going to take my Olympus PEN with me
because my mom said that I've been sent
a new olympus lens and i'm so excited to
try out similar tapes with me and head
to our house after lunch also look how
great the olympus pen fits in my Gucci
soho disco bag with plenty of room for
other stuff okay so here's the
interesting part of the day i'm now
going to get in a car and drive and i
haven't driven since the accident I'm
not like worried about it because I
don't want to like be dramatic about
something that isn't dramatic I've been
driving for 11 years I will be
absolutely fine I'm driving a courtesy
car and it's like a brand of Carla I've
never driven before
I've had two cars since they learnt how
to drive so I haven't really tried
driving now many different types of cars
so I'm like a little bit apprehensive
that it's the first time driving since
the crash and it's a new type of car but
I'm sure I'd be fine I'm not driving far
I'm gonna go have some lunch with my
family
and I need to stop doing work because
it's my birthday but I have so much work
to do oh I just got in the car rich is
so cute and thoughtful look he's already
tuned in hard Christmas radio cuz I was
so sad that we've just tuned that into
our old car and then we lost it oh
thanks rich that's my birthday I bought
myself some milky bar buttons I'm gonna
keep doing my bag later I've been given
some birthday cards from the kids honey
wrote this and drew this did she draw
this on to Bayley draw this tuna so ever
no matter so I've had a pretty loud
I miss her as well as Bailey Jojo bought
me this really nice print that I asked
for from Urban Outfitters need to find a
frame for him that I my office
Lucas come up the birthday lunch with me
lovely nap yeah we had a really yummy
lunch I come back to my parents to pick
up some post no look if any of you saw a
snapchat I was laughing at my mom who
was picking up all the leaves from
outside because she wants to dry them
for Christmas look how good they look
also my mom has the Liberty advent
calendar I very very kindly gave her
mine oh my God look how beautiful it is
I just thought she would appreciate it
so much more because I've got so much
beauty stuff see if she still stays 9 oh
she's already done it so so pretty oh
this is such a nice birthday card from
the team at look good feel better thank
you
such a pretty card this is Mac velvet
Teddy's in like a special limited
edition packaging because they've
released a perfume version of the
lipstick it's not exactly to my taste of
scent but I think it's really cool that
they're making perfumes for some of
their like cult lipsticks and this is
one of them I actually love this
lipstick I have this from Neal's Yard
which is their aromatherapy bath and
massage oils and these look so nice this
is the nourished citrus collection from
nose yard and Jess sent me this from
Neal's Yard because Anna raves about it
and we melt with her earlier in the
month and Anna was like how have you not
tried the citrus shower gel this is what
she's raves about so I'm very much
looking forward to trying this I'm gonna
get a little sniff now in this box is a
lens from Olympus and we get it out so
this is the 45 millimeter F one point n
8 lens sorry Spence you quite similar to
the canon 50ml so it's really zoomed in
but because it goes down to an F 1.8 you
get a really nice blur in the background
of the photos so this is what I think
most kind of fashion bloggers use as
their main lens and it's definitely
better than the kit lens that I've
currently got on the camera so I'm going
to switch up now and show you so this is
what I've currently got on there the 14
to 42 millimeter and it's nice but you
know you can't get that really nice blur
and it's quite limited
so I'm going to switch lenses now so
this lens is blue just kind of show you
my guess because it definitely makes the
camera look different because it's like
all nice and black for that sky it's
definitely a lot bigger so it makes the
camera feel heavier and it sticks out a
lot more which means it takes out more
bag space or if you're wearing it around
your kind of shoulder it sticks out a
lot more I've taken a before and after
photo so this is with the original kit
lens so you can kind of see you can get
a bit of blur in the background but not
too much and then if I put the new lens
on and put it all way down to 1.8 it's
definitely lot more zoomed in but as you
can see the background is like
completely blurred out and it's really
nice and crisp so I'm looking forward to
trying this out I think I'll use the
Olympus camera a lot more with this new
lens so I'm definitely excited to try it
this weekend I've just come home really
quickly to dump my stuff change my top
because we're going to restaurant
tonight called duck and rice and it's a
Chinese restaurant in Soho we've never
been before and I'm always really unsure
when I go to a new restaurant whether
I'm going to come out smelling like
cooking I really really hope I don't
because I'm getting my hair done and it
would just be such a waste but I've
changed out of my cashmere jumper
because that needs to be dry-cleaned so
I do not want that to have cooking so
hopefully it'll be really nice then I'm
gonna ghost town get my hair done and
then meet rich after work it's so dark
already but I'm going to walk to the
cheap station get the cheap there
because congestion charge whatever
boring stuff do I have time to show you
I'll quickly show you what I was given
by my family for my birthday my sister
Carly actually got me a voucher for
society6 which is a really cool website
if you want to buy like prints for your
wall but then as a little extra gift she
got me this gift this game sorry it's
playing Year's Eve my mom got me this
how-to huger book which looks so good
and my auntie got me this which is
inside vogue my mom also bought me some
really nice whistles gloves I have got
some tape mat now but like a burgundy
color and they're really warm inside
maybe I'll put these on now there's my
cold at around them and then I showed
you my sister got me this cactus print
my wall and have lots of prints my
gallery wall it's good Drive ion water
my favorite place to get a blow-dry
because it's not a hair salon it doesn't
it doesn't feel like a hairdresser it's
not like really busy so
it's hard to feel ten
we're off and on damn
again
to be
you
I've had my hair washed and blow-dried
the lady was really nice
sorry in the cutaway the little girls on
my phone the whole time but it's kind of
the beauty of that place people who
likely to get their emails done and
stuff and then Hannah phoned me wish me
happy birthday and I already missed her
phone call so I had to answer but I felt
really rude so I tried to make it quick
we're now going to go for dinner where

insane liberty Christmas shop trying to
find a topper for our tree it's actually

choose from but we can't seem to find
many tree toppers but you I love alright
we're going to get 5 of these blue ball
balls to add a bit of color to our tree

since it's a special occasion I'm gonna
light my Jame alone orange bitters
candle and this is actually sold out
everywhere so I feel very special to
have one oh my god I can smell it
already and it smells incredible rich be
honored they are here first up Jesus
okay I need to use both hands it is
literally the most beautiful candle
general own have outdone themselves this
year since the gleam Christmas party I
have been playing with my iPad Pro
because Claire Marshall from hey Claire
she said that she actually saw me write
about this which inspired her to get it
and she has been using it in such
creative ways I've used it to write on
my thumbnails and like do things like
that but I had never thought about using
its write in videos and she's been doing
that in her vlogmas videos I would
definitely recommend checking out have
vlogmas videos if you haven't yet by far
my favorite out of all the vlogmas
videos out there this month she's so so
great and yes definitely inspired me to
think about how I can integrate using my
iPad pro into videos more my handwriting
is not as nice as her as at all but I'm
definitely thinking about in the new
year starting to annotate on some of my
videos if it's kind of suitable and I'm
playing around with some different
styles and practicing my handwriting and
stuff so thank you Claire for always
inspiring me also I was trying to
convince Claire to do everyday May so I
think you should all go to Claire's
channel and tell her to join me doing
everyday May because she said she's been
really enjoying doing vlogmas so that
would be fun rich is watching suits he's
obsessed with it you put the flowers
from ana there and i'm gonna edit
today's blog i'm just come to the end of
my edit and realize i need to finish the
vlog for all of you that have been
commenting on my lips for days either
asking me if i've had a lip job or why
my lipstick was smeared at the Christmas
party it's all still because my lips are
sore and I'm trying to get in contact
with a dermatologist or something but
yeah they're really really painful thank
you guys for watching today's vlog and
for all your lovely birthday wishes on
Twitter and snapchat and everywhere I
will be vlogging again tomorrow so
