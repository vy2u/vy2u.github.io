I am blogging today and my first massive
disclaimer I'm going to do my makeup
while settle it to you is that my
parents neighbors are doing renovation
work to that house I put on Instagram
that is total karma because we're
obviously doing the same to ours and our
poor neighbors having to live through it
so now I've moved here for a bit of
peace and quiet and what building work
going on next door so I can't really
escape it because it's right there my
room is like the closest to the
neighbors so if there's lots of banging
and random noises throughout this video
they do apologize but I went to the blog
today this blog is actually sponsored by
hellofresh which I'm so excited about I
will talk to you more about it later but
you guys know I'm such a fangirl of
hellofresh so thank you to them for
sponsoring this video I'm also just
gonna do my makeup for the day I'd run
my hair and I just thought I would chat
to you whilst doing this so I've got a
kind of like home day planned but I also
have a massive to-do list including
filming which I'm not sure how I'm gonna
do that with the noise next door I will
try and I need to pop to the house and I
need to prep for a podcast at me and
honor a dinner Friday so like we're
almost halfway through and recording
them which is really really exciting
what else do I have to update you on so
like it's been quite a funny like a few
weeks work has been a little bit quiet
mainly because I think I'm just got so
much like house renovation stuff to do
I really don't know how like people
juggle it it's it it's really quite
full-on there's some days where I'm just
not needed and then like yesterday I
went to the house and I had I was there
I would literally drove back like to the
house three or four times and had to
make so many decisions on things that I
just didn't know about at all and I find
that quite stressful but it's all going
well so it's still really exciting I
have been like everyone else obsessed
with love island I watched it last year
for the first time ever we were in New
York kind of got Anna into it as well
and it just like reminds me now of that
a trip then she looked back and watched
all like previous seasons I haven't done
that so I've only watched last year's um
and I'm watching this year's and I'm
really enjoying it
I'm enjoying what listening to all the
podcasts that go alongside it as well
putting on a bit of my bare minerals
concealer by the way it also excuse my
eyebrows they have never been so bad but
I've got an appointment at a blink brow
bar for tomorrow so there's no point me
kind of like tweezer in them this
weekend just gone I went on my friend
quiches hen weekend you might have seen
on Instagram I planned it along with two
other girls and it was a huge success it
was really fun I feel like I'm a
professional hen planner by now but we
just did so much I feel like if people
spending a lot of money on hand weekend
you really need to like give them a lot
of stuff like give them value for money
and we did so much it was really really
good we you went so like swingers we had
a putter in the bath we went to a club
we went to single drag a brunch which
was really really cool and we just
played loads of games and we had her
like dressed up in a Jamaican kind of
like bobsled outfit was like an all of
one like four thing because as you guys
know she lives in Jamaica that was
really fun and now just on to the
wedding I'm a bridesmaid no job I've
ever actually officially been a
bridesmaid before because I feel like a
lot of my friends don't have bridesmaids
like me and they just kind of have
people plan ahead and get ready with
them on the day but they actually have
bridesmaids but I am officially a
bridesmaid for this one which is
exciting yeah I'm gonna carry on with
the rest of my makeup I feel like I
haven't got that much to update you guys
on I'm gonna be using this bronzer by
the way which is from Marc Jacobs it's
one those like massive ones I'm really
enjoying but I'm going to turn the
camera off and come back to you guys
once I've done my makeup okay I just on
my eyeshadow using this new Urban Decay
palette not sure how I feel about the
cover of it it's meant to look like kind
of traveling palette with Rota small
around the world but the colors are very
pretty
Lots I wouldn't use but Lots they
weren't as well so I've just done like
kind of a neutrally burnt bronze the eye
and then now I'm going to use this which
is the it cosmetics superhero mascara
which I am absolutely loving I think I
might put this in my favorites video
last month
I'm gonna go downstairs and make some
breakfast I always have my breakfast
after I've
got ready just cuz I feel like when I
first wake up it's a bit sudden but by
the time I'm ready I'm hungry and so I'm
gonna go downstairs and make some toast
or something perfume and then I need to
write out my to-do list for the day so
that I don't forget anything okay I'm at
my desk or I'm at my makeshift desk
which is basically a West Elm dining
table for my flat you know the round one
I'd like to put it in the corner of the
room I've got my cup of tea
I had to nix some milk from the
neighbors because I think my parents
used to having so many people living
here so we keep running out of milk
fun fact my parents still get their milk
delivered in the glass bottles which I
just love I think so retro I'm now
writing my to do this for the day which
is like plan a podcast a Friday film
Sunday's video although I'm debating
whether to film a sit-down video for
this Sunday ought to just vlog tomorrow
so many people just love locks I might
do that and then maybe do the sit-down
one instead of my monthly favorites this
month because I'm not sure if I have
many favorites oh man if you just
arrived upstairs and there's banging
listen I'd pay some people for house
renovations stuff I'm just gonna
basically write whole list here all my
bullet journal which I do still your
news for those of you wondering catch-up
in the end of it I'm gonna start
planning Friday's podcast I mean Anna
usually kind of take it in turns in
terms of who like starts it but we both
end up dead eating it and putting our
own questions and thoughts and stuff and
is better at working from like bullet
points
I'm better at kind of planning out
questions and that helps me more like
I'm not good at thinking on the spot but
we've got an exciting one this Friday
we've got like a brand founder a lot of
them this season are brown fat brand oh
god why can't I say Brown funders there
were so many last season this season I
feel like we're just kind of doing more
people we just like there's no like
pattern it's just like cool women doing
some cool stuff really and the one on
Friday is a brand founder though and
she's done so much in her career so what
happens as Amy who's our producer helps
us come up with some like research notes
and which is really good because then we
can base the interview on stuff that we
already know about the person but also
and stuff that we didn't know and we're
really interested in learning more about
so I usually make a Google Doc and share
it with Anna we have a kind of template
that we work
from and we are kind of splitting the
podcast format a bit differently this
year I don't want to kind of get give it
all away you will hear all about this
when we release our trailer for the new
season and so I'm gonna get planning
looking at lots of research notes and
coming up with some hopefully good
questions for this guest feel like I'm
like double vlogging today because I
just used this camera to finish up my
second renovation vlog so what I'm gonna
do is just import that footage I use
this little thing to plug into my
computer for the memory card gonna pull
that footage and I'm gonna finish
editing that renovation vlog and
schedule that so I just need to get my
memory card out of here my sister's just
popped over with some lunch which is
very kind of her because I've got dinner
sauce sauce and I'm making dinner
tonight as you know I've got my hello
fresh but haven't got anything for lunch
and haven't got much time either as you
usually when I make hello fresher but
enough for leftovers for the next day
which is so good but tonight's the first
box so I haven't got any for today I've
got some yummy sushi here which we've
pretty much almost finished
salmon Ave avocado cucumber and like a
chicken teriyaki you're right over there
okay just a little burp look at this
when you learn how to walk yeah good
okay
you could do it Oh oh my god so exciting
look what's just arrived you can't
really see it's my hello fresh box and
we're gonna show you guys properly let's
take it into the other room anything I'm
gonna have to use two hands
okay so hello fresh have provided me
with dinner
for the week for me rich and my parents
because as you guys know I'm living at
home at the moment
and me and rich do usually get
hellofresh when we're at home and whilst
we're living here my mum has very kindly
been cooking for us but this is my way
of contributing because this is how I
like to cook dinner so they've sent me a
box for dinner for a whole week I'm
gonna open it up and show you guys
what's inside
right before I show you inside let me
just explain what hellofresh is for
those of you if you don't know me and
rich are such huge fans of it because we
find that we are just so busy with our
schedules that we either found that
there was nothing in our fridge when it
came to making dinner or we'd go for a
huge food shop and then end up not using
any of it and create just so much food
waste which was such a shame my dad
actually introduced me to hello fresh
because one of the like sales people
came knocking on his door and he was
like we don't need it but I think my
daughter would love it and I ended up
doing like a trial week and I just fell
in love with the whole like idea of it
so how it works is you go on their
website and you pick from their weekly
like recipes and you just put how many
people it's for and then they deliver
those recipes and all the fresh
ingredients straight to your door and
the best thing about it is that it comes
with all the right quantities so there's
absolutely no food waste which is so
good she's got like everything you need
if you need one clove of garlic there's
one clove of garlic if you need like 100
mil of something there's 100 mil of
something for example this is everything
you need like in these little bags which
I'm gonna show you it also comes with
these recipe cards that have a really
simple step-by-step on the back with
pictures which really helps and the
range of recipes are so huge like all
different meals from around the world
this one's pork and apple burger I've
also got a veggie tikka in there we've
tried such a range of different things
I've loved every recipe that I've tried
from them it works whether you're a meat
lover or if you're a vegetarian or if
you're just too busy to even think about
cooking or if you're someone that wants
to learn more that's also how its
massively helped me it's like taught me
how to cook certain things that I
probably never would have tried before
and it's kind of giving me more of a
confidence when it comes to cooking
so hellofresh have actually provided you
guys with a discount code if you'd like
it so check out the description box if
you're interested let me show you what
I've gone here these are the recipe
cards and then inside the Box you have
the meals in bag so let me take them out
and show you also another thing I love
is that all the meat is in this like
insulated bag so if they leave it
outside your door when you're not home
it's fine until you get home because
it's
like really padded like insulated by and
inside this has like blocks of ice to
keep everything fresh how cool is that
that's creme fraiche so in here I've
like got my meat so much younger self
weight burger buns okay so for this week
my lucky parents and husband are gonna
get a pork and apple burger which I've
made before and I absolutely loved this
one a veggie tikka I have not yet tried
this one but it looks absolutely
delicious and jerk chicken which looks
so good I love jerk chicken like rice
and peas we've got three meals because
we're not in every night you can pick
obviously how many meals you want so
everything I need is here and I probably
start cooking quite early tonight
because rich is back early from work
what am I gonna make tonight I'm gonna
send the options to my parents and rich
and get them to pick what they want
tonight whilst I wait for rich to get
home because I don't start cooking until
he's back I got a delivery from and
other stories I think you would have
seen in my last vlog unless I've
completely messed up the order and then
I actually think you might see it in
next week's vlog very confusing but and
other stories kindly asked if I would
like any bits so I've picked some stuff
from their website I'm gonna unbox it
with you haven't done an unboxing in a
while so I'll rest you on here okay and
other stories let me just I actually
can't remember I picked which makes this
even more exciting ha oh my god I just
remembered I just remembered okay
here is everything inside as you can see
there is there is an ice box
Nike Nike I think it's officially Nike
but I call it Mike because I grew up in
the 90s and that's what we called it
then I Barack's from Mike and I'm really
excited about these I have this style of
trainer already in a grey and they are
the most comfortable trainer ever
there's a universe so I think they're
called hmm
both the internationalists not universal
kind of the same thing I'll link
everything below but oh my God look at
these ready ready ready my friend Esther
day is gonna be so jealous we literally
just said our whole life's talking about
how much we love these trainers oh my
god they are yellow yellow
internationalist night trainers I'm so
into yellow at the moment thinking of
painting inside of my front door yellow
then last year went to paint a pink so
clearly I'm just like a trend follower I
love these I just think if you're
wearing like an outfit like this jeans
t-shirt yellow trainers that will just
make the outfit got them in a size six
they should be alright yeah very happy
about those okay
what's next in here I think this is a
top I'm so obsessed with the best tops
from and other stories at the moment oh
wait this is not it oh this is a dress I
thought this would be really nice
because it's green and I don't how much
green in my wardrobe and it's very in
color at the moment I think it would
suit my skin tone so it's like a
spaghetti strap dress with ties at the
top I probably will just wear this with
a normal bra and just be like accept the
fact that my bra straps or on show but
you could also just wanna extract this
bra but it looks very different loose
and summery and just chilled out but
with a slip underneath I think it's
tougher being see-through
I like the V it's a similar shape to the
best I was talking about which I'll also
link down below because I'm so obsessed
I have them in every color they're so
great so that would be really nice it's
very colorful so far aren't we third
thing I think there's something else
which is coming in a separate box
placing in this book I thought I wear my
denim skirts so much that I should
really own a black denim skirt because
Mason just like the smaller version so
I've got a black denim skirt I think I
might wear this tomorrow because I've
liked a whole day in town and invent in
the evening and I feel like this is a
very like day-to-night thing to wear I
love my denim skirt but it is very like
summary which I feel like this is a bit
more
this shuttle really like that hoping it
all fits okay that is what I got from
and other stories a little mini haul but
oh my god I can't tell you how excited I
am about these trainers I have a really
nice new trainer smell come on rich
I'm so hungry okay it's only quarter
past six and we eat quite late my family
especially when my parents we're just
used to it from my dad used to get back
late from work and we'd have dinner at
like 9:00 9:30 so we're quite linked
eaters but I'm hungry today so I'm gonna
start cooking now also there's at least
35 minutes but knowing me I'm probably
gonna slow things down so I'm gonna do
jerk chicken that was the one that they
chose I offered them all of them and
we're gonna have I think we got burgers
tomorrow night because that's what me
and rich fancy tomorrow night so this
time jerk chicken with coconut rice and
bean and sweet corn salsa actually it's
good that we're going to do this one
because this is the only one I haven't
tried I wanted to do something new so
I've got the ingredients here I've got
the black beans everything is like twice
as much as I'm used to throw me rich did
it obviously it was just for two people
and out and for two onions - lots of
Caribbean barbecue jerk rub and this is
what I was saying they come in these
little packets like just the perfect
amount for what you need sorry my camera
is like not really focusing because it
just wants to focus on my face there you
go how cute are they - lots of chicken
stock pots these are game-changing
they've made food taste so much better I
don't know why I didn't use before -
lots of Tilda fat smart to eat right
YUM - lots of smarter ketchup that's
just the flavoring - lots of soya sauce
how cute are these little packets I've
never seen these before really like that
I think they just literally tear open
and then you squeeze it in it's so good
- lots of sweet corn YUM and one tin of
coconut milk and then finally two limes
I feel like had a fresh love easy lime
in there recipes which I'm all for
because they take
good and they make the food taste good
and coriander which I guess is optional
I don't love coriander
but when cooking with it I don't mind it
I bet it's probably just the seasoning
at the end I reckon it is so I'll put it
on all of theirs and probably leave it
off mine so what I usually do first is
kind of read all of the steps just so I
know what's coming and it's not shocking
color I can kind of get my head around
what the next step is so I'm gonna have
a little bit of this and then come back
to you okay I've got it I've done my
reading so the first thing I need to do
is preheat my oven to 220 220 rich yeah
thank you my sous-chef okay next thing
I'm gonna do is tie my hair up so that
no one has to eat my hair squeezing in
soya sauce second soya sauce ketchup
ketchup - Caribbean a barbecue jerk rub
oh that smells so good
another one I'm gonna mix that all
together veggies look away but this is
what the chicken looks like all
marinated it smells so good now I just
need to pop the chicken onto a baking
tray and any leftover marinade I'm gonna
just like Pat on top of the chicken my
little helper here now you back from
work we're just getting the baking tray
out meanwhile I'm gonna prep everything
else that needs doings putting a spoon
in your mouth while cutting onions
massively helps oh my god my eyes are
tearing up as soon as I check it out I
can't go out next step I am gonna heat a
little bit of oil in a pan okay I'm
gonna fry the onions
okay now the onion is cooked I'm gonna
add in the rice and hellofresh has
totally taught me how to cook rice
differently to how I was doing it before
and it's such a good method so I'm just
pouring the rice onto the onion
mixing that in with the onion and then
I'm pouring on my water coconut milk and
stop I'm just letting the stock pot
dissolve and then I'm gonna add some of
the beans some of the sweet corn and
then basically bring this to the boil
let the rice cook I'm almost ready
the rice is just cooking the chickens
finishing cooking and I may be like 10
minutes off in terms of timings but it
will give the chicken a bit of time to
cool down anyway so I just need to wait
for the rice to finish cooking it's
always a scary bits check this actually
worked ok so the rice is done I'm gonna
serve up on each plate a bit of rice
chicken and salsa I think we're also
gonna have some left over tomorrow it's
good okay now I'm adding this on top
which is basically the beans the sweet
corn coriander and lime I'm gonna
psyched sprinkle that on top we are
ready to eat this is my dish oh that's
good oh good yeah yeah coconutty mmm
everyone's I mean we look like TV dinner
family right now but this is what we do
when the chicken was so easy it's just
so it was like ketchup soya sauce was
your thing rich and the jerk chicken
seasoning mixed it on so I need to put
in the oven we're gonna finish our
dinner and we've just downloaded cocoa
to watch on TV I saw it on the plane
it's my last holiday and I loved it so
I'm making them all watch it but I hope
you guys enjoy today's vlog don't forget
