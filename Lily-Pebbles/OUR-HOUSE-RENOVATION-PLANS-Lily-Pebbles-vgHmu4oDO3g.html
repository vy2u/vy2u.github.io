going to be a very long video but I've
been promising a video like this for
quite a while and I really wanted to do
it I'm gonna do a little intro first
because it has to be done so this video
is going to be about our new house and
plans we have to renovate it
now I haven't called this video a house
tour although it is a house tour and
that would have got me a lot more views
I purposely haven't called it that
because I won't be able to watch this
video for the right reasons
now it took me a long time to decide
whether to do this I have reasons why to
do a video like this and why not to the
reasons why I wanted to do a video like
this is because I would love to watch
the video like this I said that so many
times and I think of people who are into
house renovations and before and after
and interiors and deckle I think this is
so interesting but there are many
reasons why not to post a video like
this I think it could turn into a
massive invasion of my private space I
think I'm opening myself up to get
judged a lot so I would kindly ask that
you guys watch this video in a grown-up
manner and comment like we are all grown
up because I am 30 years old I lived
with my parents till I was 27 I then
bought my first flat by myself lived in
it for two years it was a tiny flat sold
it and we now have a respectable size
house so let's all be growing up here
and not talk about money and sizes of
houses or anything like that let's just
talk about house renovations because I'm
fascinated by and I think it's really
exciting I think that's enough of a
disclaimer hopefully so I'm gonna show
you around our home today
and I'm gonna walk you through each room
and I'm gonna talk to you about what I
like about the rooms and also what I
don't like and this is actually a really
important disclaimer I'm gonna point out
the things I don't like and I'm gonna
point out the things that need work and
that's not me being negative I'm doing
this for the purpose of the video
because I want to show you what we want
to improve about each room so please
don't think I'm being negative I
absolutely love this house of course I
do I wouldn't have bought it otherwise I
think it's beautiful it's got some
amazing original features it is a
three-bed house for those of you who are
wondering and it's Terrace
so we're in between two houses we do
have a garden which is really exciting
and what else do I need to tell you it's
kind
bigger downstairs and then upstairs
there isn't much of a corridors more
like room room room we do have the
option to go up into the loft which is
something we will do one day we'll
probably move our own bedroom up there
and have an ensuite but at the moment
it's three bedrooms and just
ground-floor first of all it took us a
while to find a house that felt homey to
us but we picked this one because we
really like the layout it's got these
two reception rooms downstairs and the
wall in the middle was already knocked
down so that was really appealing to us
we wanted somewhere that we could do up
though and make it our own that's quite
an important thing I think in London
with our flat we knew that we didn't
have time to do that so we bought
somewhere that was very much like white
and new and done up but for this one we
want to put our own stamp on it and we
want to a improve the house and B just
make it our own we're probably going to
be here for the next 10 years at least
so we picked a house that has really
nice like original features in it but
also had room for improvement and I
think we probably have to do a bit more
work than we thought because we have to
redo the electric so all the plug
sockets are in the skirting board we
need to redo those and we want to put
spotlights into a lot of the rooms and
so there is more like plumbing and
electrician work than we realize but I
will talk you through each room and what
we're planning on doing is there
anything else I wanted to say at this
point I hope I haven't forgotten
anything so I haven't tidied the house
before filming this because I've got
three videos to film today and it's real
life it's not that bad hopefully you
won't see the dust let me go out here
for a minute this is our entryway for
now I've put this West Elm console table
here I'm buying furniture that I know is
gonna fit once we do the renovation so
this is really nice and it's added a
really nice like feature when you walk
in here I've also put our old mirror up
there although I will get something
bigger when we do it up so in terms of
the hallway we're hoping to get a new
radiator and this one's quite old it'd
be really nice to get one of those iron
radiators and we're trying to decide
decide at the moment whether to tile the
hallway or to have it the same kind of
wood vinyl that we're having all the way
throughout the bottom of the house but
this is what it's currently like it's
really nice actually if we weren't doing
work on the house we would have kept
this floor but we can't because we're
gonna extend hopefully so this is the
nice like wood floor that's already here
as I showed you in a previous vlog this
is what the wallpaper look like so we've
just currently painted Oh
the wallpaper just for our sanity
because it was purple we just painted
white but this will won't be white let
me do it up I don't know what colors it
would be yet but maybe some kind of gray
it's got this really nice dado rail I
think that's what it's called but
horrible textured wallpaper so this will
all just be painted but as I said it's
got this really nice features already
here and I really love the like
banisters this just reminds me of my
parents house that I grew up in it's
quite similar you've also got the under
stairs cupboard which is pretty standard
in the UK but whenever like American
viewers commented like oh my god it's
like Harry Potter so I think that's
really funny but it's quite handy for
storage we've just got like loads of
crap in there and we've also got one
here which is where the washing machine
currently lives this is kind of a funny
color paint so this would all be
repainted as well so as it stands
there's this funny little corner here
you go in here to go in the lounge and
then here is just like a funny little
corner but for now we've just put our
coats here it's gonna be really hard to
explain to you the plans but I'll just
try roughly but we're gonna put in a
toilet here there's no downstairs toilet
at the moment we would put it here but
it's not um it's not high enough so what
we're going to do hopefully is have a
sliding door here that takes you into a
little downstairs toilet we're going to
put the washer and dryer in here but
hopefully you can access it through the
toilet so that would be really nice to
have a downstairs toilet so that we have
two in the house one for rich to poo in
and then probably going to have a kind
of more compact way to hang coats here
and I really want to put a window up
here so that it lets some of the natural
light into the hallway originally we
were going to take down this wall then
open it up as another doorway but there
will be nowhere else for us to hang our
coats so actually I think putting a
window there would be a really nice way
to let some light into this hallway okay
so going into the downstairs kind of
lounge area this is what our lounge
looks like we've got our old sofa from
the flat which actually fits perfectly
I'm so happy with how that fits it's
from multi york and we've got our West
Elm coffee table and rug and West Elm
chair so this is what it looks like it's
got this kind of chimney fireplace with
two alcoves is that what's called I
really don't know any technical terms so
I'm sorry about that eventually we're
going to have built-in shelves and
cabinets here we'll have our TV be able
to go in there the moment we've got our
old made console table thing TV unit
which doesn't really fit but yeah well
have shelves and cabinets and I would
really like the lounge to be nay
b-but we will see as you see you got
this nice detailing on the ceiling we
haven't got a picture rail which is
quite handy when it comes to painting
but I don't know if it's worth putting
one of those in I think I think I'll be
all right without it the ceiling is
covered currently quite a weird color so
it would definitely make that white but
it would be nice to have maybe like a
dark lounge I think sorry you'll notice
I've changed tops because I got really
hot so that will all be built in shelves
and cabinets in a dark color now this is
the fireplace and this is something we
spoke about a lot it's amazing like a
lot of people come here and they just
fall in love with the fireplace the
thing is it's just not really our style
and it's very intense and over-the-top
and I think with a dark colored lounge
it would be even more intense so we're
currently trying to decide what to do
with it and we don't really need to make
a decision yet we'll either rip it out
and sell it because it would definitely
be worth money and put like a bit more
to subtle one in or we'll leave it I
would love a wood burner but they're
pretty expensive I don't know so I like
to think about but there's two of those
we're definitely gonna get rid of the
second fireplace because I don't think
we need both but for now this is what
the fireplace looks like and we've just
put some little pots down there this
would be really nice I think if it was
tiled over here is my new Arlo and Jacob
so far which you guys have seen and I
love that and I'm not gonna show you the
windows but we will hopefully get some
white shutters our last flat we had
Hillary's blinds shutters and they were
really great so Polly got some shutters
and some proper curtain Caeser from Ikea
they're actually alright for now but
it's not really the style that I want
this is one of our Aldi lamps that I
really love and West Elm planter so if I
look this way as I said to you also guys
if I show you kind of weird angles
that's just because I'm trying to like
protect a bit of my privacy but this
wall in between the two reception rooms
has already been knocked down which is
amazing I love open-plan living areas
something I definitely was looking for I
like that when you're in the kitchen and
people are sitting in the lounge you can
like talk to them it's something I look
for when we were looking for a flat as
well and everyone's very different about
things like that a lot of my friends
have like separate kitchens and separate
lounges and they're fine with that for
me I feel like the kitchens quite a
social area so I just really like it
when it's all open my sisters think I'm
mad they're like when you have kids
you're gonna want a room to shut them in
but I don't know maybe we could put like
a glass door up if that's the case for
now I really love having it
open this by the way as some samples of
flooring of a Chinese like vinyl this is
from antico flooring so we're looking at
them at the moment so come into the
second reception room we've got our bar
cart which we might not keep it seems a
bit unnecessary I think we might do some
more shelves or something there I'm not
sure but this is the second fireplace I
was talking about we're definitely gonna
rip that out if it was up to me I would
take the whole chimney breast out that's
too expensive so we're just gonna rip
out the fireplace it's unnecessary we
won't use this one it's better to board
it up and then we could always put like
a cabinet or something in front of it at
the moment we have this dining table
from next but this won't be here I will
talk you through our plans in a moment
so just to the right is the kitchen and
this is where I was talking about having
a toilet so we'd build into the kitchen
here and have a toilet there and in the
kitchen would start from here first of
all let me show you the current kitchen
as it is it's got these tiles which are
okay they do gather a lot of dust
everyone always comments on this it's
actually wallpaper it looks like stone
when it's wallpaper I think for the size
of the kitchen they've done pretty well
in creating a lot of storage I would say
that there's not much work surface we
literally just have this little bit here
in that a little bit there in terms of
storage it's an IKEA kitchen and
everything pulls out it's so bizarre
like that pulls out this pulls out and
then within this you've got like all of
it so it's got a lot of space it's just
really awkward to get to like really
awkward I don't think I would want a
kitchen with everything panel out but
there is quite a lot of storage in here
and the appliances aren't what we would
want but as I said it's all fine for now
it goes like a little bit far back as
well so this is kind of what the
kitchens like at the moment I'm not
going to show you out in the garden but
what we plan to do is kind of push this
entire wall back a little bit so we're
going to be extending down here and that
just means that we can push this dining
table into that little extension push
the kitchen into the extension so we get
a bigger kitchen hopefully with an
island and then because the dining
tables going to moved up you get like a
little reception room between the lounge
and the dining area and I think that
when you have kids would be really good
I think this is absolutely perfect for
us now and it's huge but it's obviously
not just gonna be me and rich and when
we do have kids I think it would get a
little bit
than here just in terms of like having
no like play area I don't know you know
we're so lucky to have all this space
and I know that you could live in a tiny
space with kids of course you can but I
think if you can why not create a space
that you think would work for you and
your family like I said I want to make
this place as good as it can be so I
think that would really make such a
difference and I've always wanted an
island in my kitchen so hopefully that
is the plan we're still in the process
of talking about how the extension would
work it's so complicated moving drains
moving boilers it's all very boring but
very exciting that's kind of a
downstairs I'm gonna take you upstairs
now this is the current carpet and it's
fine it's not the one I would have but
it's absolutely fine for now we gave it
a really good shampoo before we moved in
so all the woodwork and stuff is gonna
need sanding down and redoing it's just
like quite scuffed and old lots of
wallpaper in this house that's gonna
need ripping up ripping down like all
this is wallpapered there's like random
light sockets and places like the lights
aren't centered something I love about
this house is how high the ceilings are
people always comment on it when they
come around it makes it feel really
spacious because the ceilings are so
high so I really like how the stairs
have this little landing and then it's a
few stairs up and the bathrooms right
here so when it comes to the bathroom
we're not gonna redo it I think when we
do the renovation just because we have a
budget that we need to stick to and it
doesn't stretch to bathrooms as well
there are some rooms that we have to do
because we're going to do the electrics
and rip all the walls apart like on my
bedrooms and stuff so we have to redo
those rooms as well but the bathroom I
think we're just gonna leave it as it is
and it's funny because that previous
owners of this house I think they did up
the bathroom quite recently because they
were renting out the property and they
needed to kind of upgrade it so it is
really new and it's it's done to quite
high standard but it's just not to our
taste it's not what I would pick so I
think you'll be surprised at how nice
the bathroom is but I'll obviously point
out to you the things that I would
change about it so this is the shower in
here to the left which is probably where
I would put the toilet and it's all
tiled which is really nice it's got this
huge bath which everyone's always so
impressed with when they come over and
it's definitely something we liked when
we looked at the house I'm glad I got to
try it out there because I don't think I
would buy a bath like this again it's
really awkward to lie down in because
you kind of slide so I find myself just
sitting in the middle and it doesn't
fill up very fast so anyway it's so nice
to have a nice bar that we can use and I
really like how it's got this section
from the wall taken out so I can put all
my products in there I think that's a
really nice feature that I would
definitely carry through when we redo
the bathroom hopefully in a few years I
just got like an Ikea towel rack there
it's all tiled the windows need to be
doing on this side of the house upstairs
because they're they're a bit dodgy
toilet there and then this huge sink
it's so fun to have a double sink we've
never had that our last place had one
tiny sink for us to share so it's really
nice having our insides as Stephanie
made me realize that we want to have two
sinks it's also got a lot of storage in
here for all of my products so it's
absolutely fine like I said it's black
and brown it's not to my taste but it is
so fine and it's nice and spacious it's
a big bathroom I definitely wanted a big
bathroom it was something I was looking
for a lot of the houses had quite small
ones I think when you've got kids and a
family it's nice to have a bit of space
in the bathroom I've left all the lights
on for this video by the way I don't
just leave them on ok let me show you my
office thing I've shown this before this
is what it looks like
sofa bed drawers desk not much to show
lots of weird lights in this house like
this I definitely want to put spotlights
in for me it's just easier like I think
the lounge will leave a hanging light
but everywhere else will have spotlights
this room just needs repainting new
carpets and plug sockets this is our
bedroom this room I really like as well
so it's got the chimney breast again and
then the two sides either side of it
which I would really love to have
built-in wardrobes I think our IKEA
wardrobe is really great but what I
don't like is that they don't go all the
way to the top and I think if we had
built in it would go all the way to the
top it would look really neat we
customized it inside as much as we like
rich could have his own wardrobe I could
have my own wardrobe and then we'd
probably have a TV in the middle but
maybe with like doors so we have the
option to cover the TV if we don't want
it I can imagine like a TV and then like
a few drawers underneath it would be
cool at the moment we just got like
laundry and a picture and exposed floor
because this is where we ripped out the
old wardrobes the floor is amazing but
my sister has this floor in her bedroom
and she said it gets really dusty so I
think we will just keep carpet it's a
shame because they look nice but I think
it's more like a trendy thing than a
practical thing at the moment we've got
these next bedside tables and Aldi lamps
and the same headboard from West Elm as
before the walls
smelly and wallpapered and they're kind
of like gray silver it's really gross
but like I said until we redo all their
lectures because as you can see all the
plug sockets are on the skirting board
which is actually now illegal to install
those it's okay to have them but it's
quite difficult a lot of the mac plugs
they kind of go down so you can't plug
them in anyway so they'll have to like
chase up the wall so we're not bothering
me doing the walls yet so this is our
bed same bed as before and then for now
I just got an Ikea dressing table one
day I'll get like a really pretty one
but for now this is really nice and it
keeps all my products in there so that's
what I've got there with like a little
basket for my scarves and a little stool
I've got a extension cord here because I
need to plug in my straighteners and we
had to get an extra light here because
because there's no spotlights the light
is really dark in here and then I've got
better table as well so that's what the
bedroom looks like Oh while I'm here
I'll show you what the doors look like I
don't know where that we would paint
them or not but they're nice doors I
think he's our original handles I'm not
sure if I love them but they're pretty
cool like the locks look currently
intense the locks are I don't know
they're interesting and then the final
room is this little one which I have a
video coming up all about this room so I
won't show you too much but it's got
crazy funky wallpaper and it's just like
a little room there's not really much to
show you which is washing is in here
there's a chair and these drawers have
like all of my camera equipment in like
this we've got some like filing there
and really funky old satin curtains
yeah more funky locks I'm here so that
is our home and that's kind of our plans
for redoing it the biggest thing I think
could be the extension and we doing
right all the flooring and all the like
electrician stuff and plumbing all the
boring stuff it's not really like they
were not gonna like tear down walls and
stuff but it's really exciting I can't
wait to kind of actually start the work
we're gonna have to move back in with my
parents we're so lucky that we can do
that but oh my god it's getting painful
but I'm really happy here it's just got
such a nice vibe to it I feel really at
home I feel really comfortable and as
frustrating as it is to not be able to
like do it how we want it yet I know it
will so be worth it when we eventually
do and I'm so glad that we were quite
sensible in the sorts of place that we
bought so that we have a bit of money to
do it up and make it our own
and I think that's kind of all I've got
to say if you guys have any questions
let me know or if you have any tips if
you've done up a place of your own
before you know I've never done this
feel free to leave your tips in the
comment section down below
as I said please be nice to me and don't
be judgy I really can't stand it when I
see comments of people saying like I'm
only doing that job because I need to
pay off my mortgage for my new house
it's just not the case I'm still the
same me I'm still honest I still only
work with brands I like nothing has
changed I would never put myself in a
position where I have to do work that I
don't want to do I'm far more sensible
than that so I really hope you guys
enjoyed watching this video and I really
love bringing you on the journey with me
that's what this is all about and I love
sharing it with you guys so I really
hope we can make it like a positive
ongoing thing I think if this video goes
down well I'll definitely share the
whole renovation process and I think
it's gonna be really fun it will be
really hard but so worth it and really
exciting if you've enjoyed this video
and I will see you guys in the next one
