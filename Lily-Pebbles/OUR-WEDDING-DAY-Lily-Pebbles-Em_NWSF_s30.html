my idea
it's where rich grew up and I have such
lovely memories of visiting all of his
family here since the moment I met rich
I was completely overwhelmed by his pure
kindness he is literally the most
selfless caring person I've ever met in
my life and I know you all agree because
I spend most my life having to hear
about how much you're loved rich and I
mean it's not ideal that I'm always the
less preferred one out of the two of us
but I do love watching new people meet
rich gratefully never hunted before
moving to London I was clearly
outnumbered in the department when it
came to um lily and her double digit
best friends but I'm really lucky to be
in a position today to say that they too
have become mine probably prefer me now
in all seriousness how fit does my wife
look
it's taken me nine years to get where I
am today in this relationship at the
beginning it took me a good month to
persuade her to actually acknowledge me
so I'm doing good being married right
now
last year I think it was August I was
having a particularly miserable day I'd
had to put my dog down that day and I
was sitting up in my office 8 or 9
o'clock in the evening bit tearful and
the door bursts open a wall Ritchie who
pronounced he was going to ask Lily to
marry him the next day so clearly timing
wasn't a great asset but I figured he
made a pretty good replacement for Dixie
so I ratified the clown
you're extremely lucky Pierre marrying
is such a beautiful conscientious and
prosperous young woman rich on the other
hand is sat there trying to figure out
what those last two words mean
elevennews always have a good time
lynnie rich told me that they wanted
their wedding to feel personal relaxed
and a true celebration of rio lung they
told me marriage to them is about
becoming a team and creating their own
little family with the values that
they've learned now the two of them have
been together for nine years now and
they've been open to this discussion of
marriage from the beginning so they say
that this day just feels like a
completely natural step for them
neither of them feel scared nor novice
though perhaps I should have asked that
question today I promise to always laugh
at your riches earnest and continue
loving you even when you say that
with this ring I'm honored you'll become
my husband
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
