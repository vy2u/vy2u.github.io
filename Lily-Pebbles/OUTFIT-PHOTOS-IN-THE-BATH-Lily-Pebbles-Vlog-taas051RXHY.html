the world
come on a drunk I'm up pretty bright and
early for a Saturday just having some
porridge because this morning my
personal trainer is coming to my flat we
don't normally do weekends we normally
do weekdays and yes he started coming to
my flat which is kind of weird that's
what she does she goes to people's homes
because it means that she can charge
less because she doesn't have rent and a
private gym I don't know if it works
everywhere the same around the world but
if you workout in a virgin or pure gym
one of big gitans you can't have your
own personal trainer you have to use one
of those so if you want your own
personal trainer offering you kind of
train in a private gym but it can add
like 20 quid to the sessions to keep it
affordable
she trains me in my crap and I do for
most people who have large homes it
works I have a very small flat 512
square foot to be precise and there
isn't like a big room that's empty but
what I do they move the signing table a
bit to the side and we kind of work out
in the kitchen which is it is weird but
it's working and be honest anything to
get me exercising once a week I should
just do I thought maybe I'll update you
on my exercising thing whilst eating
sorry if you don't know my exercising a
story let me put it in brief was really
into sport as a kid throughout school
always in like the netball team the
rounders team I love tennis so I'm into
a competitive sport
then I went to uni no one really
exercises that you need join a gym
because it sounds cool but you don't
ever go and then after uni I just kind
of struggled to find the exercise I
enjoyed and how to work into my life
competitive sport became too competitive
and you know I don't I can't deal with
like really competitive female sport and
I started working for myself and going
to classes became quite hard because to
have to go into town to do an expert
class that is like quite a commitment I
feel like if you can just go on the way
back from work and easier and you can go
with people from work but for me leaving
my flat and going into town for a class
haven't quite mastered that yet
I really enjoyed boxing monitored it
briefly I'd like start again if I can
find someone I like to sort of
one-on-one boxing with someone's got
pads
well then boxing just like a bag but I
tried to class on training think about
for me I quite like it one on one
also I really like Pilates but I stopped
doing that now again it's just like a
time thing so I have personal trainer
now I went through two
I really liked them but I don't know I
just kept like falling out of love with
it and now I have a female personal
trainer who's actually a friend of a
friend and it's working really well I
really like having a female trainer so
like she really understands me and my
body better I still struggle to get
motivated before working out and for the
half hour which is right now I get a bit
like nervous and it just like I am you
want to cancel and pretend I'm ill but I
do like the feeling afterwards I just
like the feeling of feeling my muscles
right it's not fun to ache like for days
I still ache for four days after I work
out but it's nice it just feel connected
with your body somehow I hate it whilst
I'm doing it but she's quite good she's
- teacher she's a part-time teacher
part-time personal trainer so she's
quite strict if I'm not doing something
she'll shafted me which makes me do it
it's also nice to just be able to jump
in the shower as soon as I finished and
not be in a gym full of men like lifting
weights
knowing the weight thing at all so that
is where I'm at with the exercise of
Indian personal training once a week for
a year and I know person training once a
week is not enough but it's better than
what I was doing before which there's
nothing I'm not doing it first weight
reasons or to look good in a dress I'm
simply just doing it because I don't
want to die of a heart attack and I
think it's important to try and stay
healthy I know it could be doing more
but honestly I feel like at least I'm
doing there then when summer comes I try
to do more like tennis or things like
that because I just enjoy it more but
she makes me do cut like a hit class
burpees squat skipping didn't really
need that much like apparatus for that
word it's crazy how hard she can get me
to work with just a mat and a ball and a
chair may try and film a session today I
don't know if it'll work or not I might
just put on a time-lapse but maybe in
the summer or spring I'll do like a cup
of video showing what I do and how I
kind of got exercise to work for me
because I know there are a lot of people
out there like me you hate exercise and
it painful to see all the people in
Instagram loving exercise I'm going to
finish my porridge
we'll be back in a sec okay Jen's going
to be here in a minute and this is my
kitchen so I hope you guys enjoy this
very speed up kitchen workout I don't
want to
oh man I look a mess but that was good
maybe I need to shower and then I will
come back you guys
so haven't got around to doing my hair
and makeup yet but I wanted to try out
this drink because I was given this this
week in a PR meeting super elixir
nourishing protein by welco of three
year and I've never had like a protein
shake because I'm terrified of them I
feel like people who get really muscley
have protein shakes and I've never
understood them but I was talking to
Anna and the PR girls about it and they
were like it just helps also a little
bit hungry because it's been all the
time now we haven't had lunch I'm not
ready to go out and it helps like repair
your muscles or something like that I
don't know I think I'm going to hate it
because I don't like things that taste
gross but let's try this is the vanilla
flavor Anna so she thinks that I prefer
this one and it's but one scoop and I
think on the milk if we have almond milk
I think noodles have fun yeah many of us
will go 3,250 one scoop and 250 mils and
I don't know if I'll cops we have any
cups that are that big so I'm just going
to measure it in a measuring jug we do
rich can you help it in the docs I can't
figure out get the lid off the lid off
peel foil okay so one scoop wait wait
how you making it I'm going to put it in
there and then pour it into a glass no
no you mix mix it you shake it can't
just like spin it round I don't have a
shaker only level is now grating on a
light smell very powdery blending
blender what the hell I'm just going to
give this a go once key 250 would be
there
Joey Porto and stuff right that's really
rich want me to use the mixer woo get a
shaker looks like it's working
my hair is so crazy I'm ready for the
taste test smells like play-doh hmm I
don't like it to bit powdery taste test
number two you blended it properly now
I don't like it I can't Oh which is
happy music he gets to have it I just it
doesn't taste nice sorry I'm going to
get ready hair and makeup is done and I
think we can head out now we want to get
some lunch maybe see the fam although
some of my it may need to mess your ill
and probably went to see them maybe see
Carly get some food I really want like a
bun I don't know what I want
umm please get out of the slap I
actually got a haircut yesterday I went
to hirtius ins and conduit street and I
had a guy cook Bobby who I've never had
before because last time I had Scott but
Scott left so I'd Bobby and I really
liked him actually like a really good
haircut he just did what I wanted it
probably doesn't look that different to
you guys because I said I really like
the length it was just really bulky at
the back so it wasn't like a tidy up and
I'm really happy because I feel like
hair dress has always cut it really
short when you say you don't want it
short I like it being a little bit
longer than it used to be so really
happy with the haircut also I have
another thing to update on which is so
exciting I found out two nights ago that
I have been nominated for a glamour
Woman of the Year award and I cannot
believe it I went to the award last year
and I loved it I found the whole thing
so like inspirational all these amazing
women who've done amazing things and it
was really funny and the vibe was great
so the fact that I've been nominated is
crazy
I'm going to walk out to the washing
machines on I feel very very honored and
very excited about it I mean the list of
people in my category which is the
YouTube category is insane like I think
I'm friends and everyone in the category
and some amazing women I mean like pixie
woo in there there's lots of other
people that totally deserve to win so
I'm just happy to be nominated but
obviously if you guys want to vote for
me if you like my videos and stuff I
will put the link below in the
description box and I would love it if
you voted I'm just excited that
hopefully I'll get to go again really
really cool
I've seen some tweets going around
saying how quite a few people are
disappointed that the nominees aren't a
tool diverse and I completely agree and
I wish that I could have had a part in
that
ofc didn't have any say in who was
nominated
I can't control how things change but I
definitely acknowledged that I
completely agree
I wish the nominees were more diverse in
our category
I do think everyone nominated deserves
it and it's so nice to see so many
friends in the category as well so yeah
anyway I'll put the link below so
excited about that it just is a little
bit pat on the back when you work for
yourself you don't often get kind of
credit and acknowledgement like that so
it's so nice just to be considered go
wear this which is the Charlotte Tilbury
lip cheat lip liner in pillow talk and
she's just bought out a lipstick version
which is so exciting it's an absolutely
gorgeous nude like a slightly darker
nude and I really really like it I'm
going to put that on now we're now in
town and we're hoping to get into a
place booked on the báb I think it's
like funds and things like that not
research they it looks good living is
Korean so instead of Korean okay maybe
it's Korean but we have no idea where it
is and this is give me a cue or not so
we're just heading there's like just a
small urban High Street here do this
Wow that was so good I would very very
highly recommend on the Bab if you want
like a quick lunch is very casual riders
annuity table so if it's busy it
probably nightmare but we were really
lucky it was a busy very chilled and
really really delicious
it does Korean Street food even though
my sister said buns on from Korea so I
don't know maybe it's like fusion but
you have funds or giving back or like
chicken and rice and it was really good
you like it yeah well done Richard
reciprocal
yeah which has this list going the place
you want to visit in London and very
good list have to say there's also a
good life III here and I've never been
mad and maybe we'll go have a look now
to get a juice okay change of plans we
decided we're not quite ready for juice
we're going to go to Selfridges because
I want to buy some sunglasses for
honeymoon I know I've got loads of
sunglasses but I think 9 out of 10 of
them don't actually suit me more really
need to figure out how to sell them
you're going to have my brand
Erica's aren't easier or any other thing
my grave and Eric is really suit rich
he's going to have those and my round
blue sunglasses I born la a broker and
apparently the complex gusted about that
so I'm just going to see what's around
these are feel and I quite like these
actually don't see a lot bigger
very comfortable there's art on to 550
pounds versus unreal
three ladies close it will directly
Celsius to those menus for preschool and
it's typically done by companies Bank
we're going to head up there to the few
galleries I want to start looking at

much use out of them but I need to have
support I have to wear that we're just
trying on these two from Chloe they are
