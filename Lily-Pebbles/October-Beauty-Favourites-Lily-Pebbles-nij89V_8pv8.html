or Instagram you'll probably know that
I'm currently in New York so I've pre
filmed this video just a little bit but
I promise it's definitely been a month
since my last monthly favorites so today
I'm gonna be talking about my October
favorites I can't believe it's the end
of October already that's completely
madness but I've quickly compiled a
little list of my favorites this month
and I'm going to show them to you I
think a lot of these you would have seen
pop-up and videos throughout the month
or blog posts because i have been loving
them so obviously i've been talking
about them first one is the burberry
foundation this is the cute forget where
it's cool with the fresh glow foundation
and I have shade 26 beige I absolutely
love this foundation I've worn it every
day this month couldn't take it to New
York with me as i showed in my last kind
of packing video because the packaging
is quite like actually not that heavy
but it's quite bulky I just think this
is a really gorgeous foundation I used
it in my autumn berry tutorial so if you
want to see it in action i will link
that video down below it's very jewy
fresh-looking not too heavy doesn't
really cover blemishes but makes the
skin very even and fresh by the way all
these products will be listed in the
description box below and I see a lot of
people in the comments ask questions
like what are you wearing on your nails
and everything is down there all you
have to do is click the little button
that says I think it says see more or
read more and there's so much info down
there so please go check the description
box the two nail polishes I've been
loving this month are the first one is
Barry M vintage violet so what it's
called yeah and this is a really nice
dark kind of muted down plum I would
call it I really like this I did a blog
post on it so I'll also link that down
below you can see like a proper photo of
me wearing it it's just a really kind of
different shade I don't really have one
like this which is surprising because I
have a lot of nail polishes so yeah I've
really been enjoying wearing this I also
love this so much i'm wearing today
although is slightly chipped sorry this
is se hide and go sheet and has a true
nail polish addicts I am ashamed to say
I don't remember buying this I have no
idea where it came from i just found it
in my collection and I just was like
this looks nice but I don't remember
buying it so if you hang up my nails
this week and I really really like it
another product that i mentioned in my
what's in my travel beauty bag video is
the bomb frat boy blush and i've been
using this
lot this month it's a really kind of
simple no fuss free blusher it's like a
peachy pink it has really good
pigmentation you need a tiny amount on
your brush and it kind of goes with any
I or lip look and that's why I really
like it I definitely recommend the bar
if you can get them on feel unique which
is free delivery worldwide it's come
around to that time of year again where
I can go and shop in lush and i'm so
excited i know i can shop there all year
round but i love lush during the autumn
winter months i mentioned it in the BTW
chat video i did with anna and yeah we
got a little bit giddy and then went to
lush and spend a fortune I'm just such a
bath person and I love finding lovely
products for the bath a lot of stuff at
lush is a little bit too sweet for me
and I can't stand the glitter but if you
find the right things there are some
absolutely lovely bits as well a couple
of my favorites this year are the butter
bear which is like they're butter ball
and bath bomb but in a little bear shape
and it's absolutely so cute smells
delicious and this which is amazing it's
the yolk nog soap and I've never ready
bought soap from lush before because I
don't really use like hard soap in the
shower i'll use like a shower gel
without sour cream but this not so good
I literally couldn't resist it looks
like cheesecake kind of oh it smells so
amazing it kind of smells a bit like
caramel it's really good i definitely
recommend go and giving it a sniff and i
just i bought like a tiniest bit because
i knew i would use it that much but i
used a little bit on my skin when i was
in the bath and that's really nice as
well large have some amazing Christmas
sets coming out and they actually gave
me one and I couldn't not show this in
my favourites video because it's insane
get ready guys this is the art of bar
Thane and it's like this huge huge box
and inside are all these bath products
they're like bath bombs bath melts bath
so it's literally incredible it has all
of these in it and lush have some really
get sets this Christmas so I am
definitely going to enjoy working my way
through that one another thing I love
about autumn winters I can start wearing
the different sort of perfumes a little
bit deeper and bit more masculine and I
love this sort of sense one I have loved
for years and this is probably featured
in so many favorites videos
the eccentric molecule molecule 01 and I
completely finished this there's a tiny
bit left but really hard to get so
ordered another one from beauty
which I have here and i just opened it
and completely chipped my nails which is
very annoying but if you've always open
in a brand new one I get them refills
because they're 27 pounds which is
cheaper basic means it doesn't come with
a lid but I'm fine with that if I prefer
to pay less and not get a lid I just
love the scent of this and whenever I
where people always compliment me on it
another product I mentioned in my what's
in my travel beauty bag video is from
vo5 and it's nourish my shine it's a
heat defense cream that also gives nice
kind of illumination and shine to the
hair and I've really enjoyed using this
when my hair is wet or when my hair is
dry I've also said goodbye to my
hourglass arched brow pencil I'm sorry
hourglass but a nostalgia definitely one
that little battle I did like a battle
of the brows blog post which I will link
below and Anastasia brow Wiz definitely
came out top but then I've also been
loving the soap &amp;amp; Glory archery and I've
done a blog post I don't know if it's
gone up yet if it has our link below
where I'm comparing the two and they are
so so similar really the only difference
is there are way more shades for the UH
nostalgia one so glory only has a dog
and a light and the dark one is very
warm so if the soap &amp;amp; Glory one is the
right shade for you I definitely
recommend getting up because it's so
much cheaper but I love both of these so
I've been enjoying using them both this
month I've also been loving my urban
outfitters backpack this month I did a
blog post on it and I featured it in my
autumn lookbooks i'll insert a little
clip here but i've been wearing this
every day it's just so comfortable it's
so nice to have both my arms free I
could do whatever I one especially when
I'm running around London with loads of
bags and stuff it's great I think it's
definitely more safe than a traditional
backpack because it has like a double
clip in a zip and I just have really
enjoyed wearing a backpack I can wear on
one shoulder to be more casual or to
like during the day and it's something
I've never really had before since my
school days so I absolutely love it
final thing my favorites video is this
coconut water font uno CO and I've
mentioned this a couple of times and I
mentioned it in a blog post this is my
all-time favorite coconut water I really
don't like Vita Coco I feel like it
tastes a bit like bad breath sorry
that's put anyone off this one is so
great though it's called raw coconut
water and then the difference is I think
they use young green coconuts and
a drink is actually pink it's naturally
pink which is really nice but I think
this just has a really nice sweet taste
to it hasn't got that weird aftertaste
tool it's so hydrating that's the
benefits of drinking coconut water over
normal waters that it really hydrates
you it's great if you do exercise but I
don't I just like to drink it it's a
great thing to drink in the afternoon
when you feel in a bit like the you know
when you're Sydney or desk and you're
getting a bit tired I love to have one
of these and it kind of perks me up it's
just really natural war good for you and
taste delicious okay so that's
everything for my October favorites
