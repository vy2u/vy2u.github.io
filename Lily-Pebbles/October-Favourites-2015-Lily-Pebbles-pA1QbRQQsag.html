October favorites and as usual I've got
a mix of beauty and lifestyle and other
bits and the first thing I'm going to
show you is my Vizio odd palette and I'm
so glad that I'm finally getting a lot
of use out of this thing because I
bought it about a year ago it's so crazy
expensive I think it was like was either
60 or 80 pounds either way so expensive
for an eyeshadow palette I was just so
excited to see it in the UK that I kind
of just bought it and then felt really
guilty for ages afterwards but I've been
using it so much this month I've really
got a lot of wear out of it it's got 12
I shadowed in it and they're all very
kind of neutral warm tones which is
really what I like to wear they're all
completely matte which is great
especially for this time of year I
really like where I'm at I shadow Xand a
bold lip and I just find that it's so
quick and easy to use the shadows are
really pigmented and easy to blend and
you can just put one all over the lid or
you can get quite creative
I love these three actually this all
this kind of like middle row and then
these two as well they're so flattering
on my eye color and hair color and I
absolutely love them so I'm really
really glad I got this palette and I've
been using it a lot this month I forgot
to mention this in last month's
favorites that I was gutted when it came
to editing I did add it in the
description box but for those of you
that didn't catch that I'm still loving
this so I thought I'd mention it this
month as well it's by pixie and it's the
hydrating of milk you missed this is
like one of those hydrating sprays I'm
gonna put a bit on now so nice it's like
a hydrating mist but it's different to
most because it's milky what makes it
milk is this got hyaluronic acid and
black oat it's probably the oats that
makes it milky and it's just so
hydrating when I'm sitting at my desk
especially on days where I'm not wearing
any makeup
I just put loads of this on my skin and
it feels so nice my skin just like
drinks it up it's also really nice on
top of makeup as you can see it didn't
kind of disrupt my makeup at all it's
very very light and I'm still loving
this like it looks like I'm hard can use
any and I swear I use this every day
I imagine this product in my boots haul
and a lot of you guys have tweeted me to
ask how I'm getting on so I thought I'd
mention it in this video it's by Sally
Hansen it's her miracle cure I was
really suffering from flaking chipping
nails and I went into Boots Osbert
overwhelmed with how many Sally Hansen
ones there
but I think I tweeted and you guys told
me this song is a really good one to get
so I picked it up and I do really like
it I actually think it's made such a
difference I didn't really think about
it until it came to filming this video
that actually I don't remember the last
time my nails kind of flaked or chipped
they've been such good quality I
basically just use this as a base coat
when I'm painting my nails so I don't
even use it like every day or that
offered maybe every like four days and
it's made such a massive difference so
I'm really impressed with that if you
need to thank to strengthen your nails
then I would go for this one for sure
I've mentioned this range from the white
company before it's their wild mint
peppermint and white tea I've had the
candle for quite a few years now I keep
repurchasing and it's such a lovely
scent I've recently got the diffuser and
the room spray as well and I put those
in my bathroom the rune spray is amazing
I think if you're gonna pick one thing
from the range I would go for the room
spray because it's just so like strong
minute the scent really lasts all day
it's just such a fresh it's like a fresh
but warming and homely scent I can't
even explain it's very different to
anything else I've smelled so I
recommend going into store give it a
sniff because it could be a love/hate
thing I personally love it and love the
mint part of it it's such a nice fresh
scent to have in your home so I've been
loving the home spray I'm sorry if I'm
looking at a little bit pale and bright
it's very hard to balance the light when
it's such a dull gloomy day outside but
the next product is from Estee Lauder
and I can't believe I haven't really
spoken much about this because I just
finished an entire tube and when I got
my new on I thought I really should talk
about this more because I absolutely
love it it's just become so part of my
daily routine nervous I've just
forgotten about it really
it's the Estee Lauder CC cream and I use
this every single day I use a small
squeeze and I mix it with my foundation
I know that some people I know Ana uses
I think just by itself all over the skin
which is really nice as well I like to
mix it with my foundations because I
feel like it makes the foundation even
more dewy and blendable and has a slight
tint to it as well so I feel like it
gives me a slight tan just takes the
edge off a little bit I love it I
finished an entire tube I'm onto my
second one and it's a great product
I feel like a CC cream is one of those
things you think what does that really
do I don't really know what it does but
does something great whatever it is it
makes your skin just glowy and love
and I'm gonna talk too much about these
because I've been banging on about the
hmm beauty range and so many videos you
guys know I'm so impressed with it but
if I had to pick one thing from the
range that I've tried my favorite thing
so far are the cream eyeshadows I have
two one is a slightly warm brown ones a
slightly cooler kind of taupey brown I
will write the names within down below
because they're so small and I can't
even read them but these are great I
don't feel like I need to repurchase my
Estee Lauder chained cream eyeshadow
which is my all-time favorite because I
think this is so so similar it's like
slightly moosie you i comply with a flat
brush and then blend out and it lasts
all day without creasing they're so
great they've got proper lips I feel
like they weren't dry out I'm just the
quality of these are unreal so if you
like cream eyeshadows especially the
warm Brown one it's so so pretty then go
and check out H&amp;amp;M beauty's range they've
got quite a few shades as well I always
have a couple of lipsticks floating
around my handbags and this month it's
definitely been B's too and I've been
her swapping between both of them the
first one is from Laura Mercier and
Tanya burr mentioned in her video that
she wore this on her wedding day and I
thought wow if she wore this on her
wedding day it must be amazing what a
recommendation I love buying things that
youtubers that I watch recommend so I
went to get it it's called spiced rose
it's by Laura Mercier and it's such a
pretty color it's slightly darker on me
so it's not quite kind of nude or
neutral but it's like a slightly rosy
Brown II tone it's so autumnal and
beautiful I'm not wearing it right now
I'm wearing Charlotte Tilbury Bond girl
which I love this isn't my it's creamy
so it's so easy to wear during the day
and I've been wearing this like every
day I absolutely love it so I'm really
glad I picked that up thanks for the
recommendation Tania and the next one is
from Clarins and it's called tea rose I
here tried out pretty much all of the
lipsticks in this range and this was
definitely my favorite it's a bit
different other shades that I wear it's
like a nude neutral but it's slightly
more pink it's quite a pale pink
actually but I like to blend in with my
finger just so it's not too like out
there and it's really pretty it's just
slightly more fresh than the laura
mercier lipstick so when I'm having like
a real kind of no makeup makeup day and
I want something a bit more neutral this
one's really pretty and those two or
what I've been wearing all months very
easy lipsticks
okay so now for some non Beauty stuff
the first thing I've been loving is this
you might think what the hell in
this it's Oliver bonus and you basically
rest it on your desk and you can put
papers or anything in there I keep a lot
of press releases and documents and
letters that I kind of Oz to open
because they're full of bank statements
and I'd pile them all in here and it
looks really pretty on my desk and it's
copper and lovely so I like the whole
range from Oliver bonus of stuff like
that so definitely go there if you want
kind of desk stationary stuff I've also
got an online series a TV series and a
film to recommend so that on my series
is the Alexa Chung and vogue series it
was on the British Vogue YouTube channel
and I think it was a brilliant concept
an idea really well executed it was
maybe like a five-part series they've
now uploaded it as one big hour-long
special so I will link that down below
Alexa Chung is the presenter and it's
all about the fashion industry how you
can get into it
all the different jobs that come around
the fashion industry because not just
about kind of being the designer or
sitting on the front row there's so many
little jobs and it makes it really easy
to understand and really accessible for
people who just love fashion but maybe
don't love the kind of glitzy side of it
Alexa tell me it's great I think she's
such a good presenter you can tell that
she just pushed aside any script she was
given and just did her own thing I think
she's hilarious she's got such a great
personality I love her so go and check
out that series I think it was a really
good move on Vogue spot and I really
enjoyed watching it I watched every
episode as it was uploaded TV show I
would definitely recommend is NAR cos I
think I'm saying that right me and rich
just finished it it's on Netflix and
it's all about the Colombian drug lord
Pablo Escobar and it's so so interesting
you just don't learn about things like
that in school and I can't really
believe it's real but it is and it's so
gripping we were watching like two or
three episodes at a time so go if you
have Netflix definitely definitely watch
it I also saw the film suffragette two
nights ago and I really enjoyed it or
went with my sister again it's something
you learn around school but you don't
really relate to or fully understand and
they finally made a proper film about
suffragettes and it's so interesting
it's so like I came out feeling quite
angry but I feel like that's a good
thing when a film's done really well you
kind of evokes emotion I would really
recommend see in it and make your
boyfriend and husband and brother go and
see it
because rich wouldn't see it with me I'm
really annoyed about that the storylines
just incredible it's kind of based on a
true story but they've also built some
characters around it and yeah it's a
really emotional film so those are all
my favorites this month that you guys
enjoyed seeing what products I've been
loving and TV shows and stuff let me
know if you've been enjoying any films
or TV shows recently I'm always looking
to try new things and I will see you on
Tuesday for my weekly vlog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
