my October favorites and as usual I've
got a mix of beauty and lifestyle and
other bits and the first thing I'm going
to show you is my Vizier odd palette and
I'm so glad that I'm finally getting a
lot of use out of this thing because I
bought it about a year ago it's so crazy
expensive i think it was like was either
60 or 80 pounds either way so expensive
for an eyeshadow palette I was just so
excited to see it in the UK that I kind
of just bought it and then felt really
guilty for ages afterwards but I've been
using it so much this month I've really
got a lot of wear out of it it's got 12
eyeshadows in it and they're all very
kind of neutral warm tones which is
really what I like to wear they're all
completely map which is great especially
for this time of year I really like
where I'm at eyeshadows and a bold lip
and I just find that it's so quick and
easy to use the shadows are really
pigmented and easy to blend and you can
just put one all over the lid or you can
get quite creative i love these three
actually this all this kind of like
middle row and then these two as well
they're so flattering on my eye color
and hair color and i absolutely love
them so I'm really really glad i got
this palette and i've been using it a
lot this month i forgot to mention this
in last month's favorites that I was
gutted when it came to editing i did add
it in the description box but for those
of you that didn't catch that i'm still
loving this so i thought i'd mention it
this month as well it's by pixie and
it's the hydrating of milk you missed
this is like one of those hydrating
sprays I'm going to put a bit on now so
nice it's like a hydrating mist but it's
different to most because it's milky
what makes it milk is this got
hyaluronic acid and black coat it's
probably the oats that makes it milky
and it's just so hydrating when I
sitting at my desk especially on days
where I'm not wearing any makeup I just
put loads of this on my skin and it
feels so nice my skin just like drinks
it up it's also really nice on top of
makeup as you can see it didn't kind of
disrupt my makeup at all it's very very
light and I'm still loving this but it
looks like I'm hardly used any and I
swear I use this every day I imagine
this product in my boots hold and a lot
of you guys have tweeted me to ask how
i'm getting on so i thought i'd mention
it in this video it's by sally hansen
it's her miracle cure i was really
suffering from flaking chipping nails
and I went into boots Osbert overwhelmed
with how many Sally Hansen ones there
were but I think I tweeted and you guys
told me this song is a really good one
to get so I picked it up and I do really
like it I actually think it's made such
a difference I didn't really think about
it until it came to filming this video
that actually I don't remember the last
time my nails kind of flaked or chipped
they've been such good quality I
basically just use this as a base coat
when I'm painting my nails so I don't
even use it like everyday all that often
maybe every like four days and it's made
such a massive difference so I'm really
impressed with that if you need to thank
to strengthen your nails then I would go
for this one for sure I've mentioned
this range from the white company before
it's their wild mint peppermint and
white tea I've had the candle for quite
a few years now I keep you purchase a
man it's such a lovely scent I recently
got the diffuser and the room spray as
well and I put those in my bathroom the
rune spray is amazing I think you're
going to pick one thing from the range i
would go for the room spray because it's
just so like strong and it the scent
really lasts all day it's just such a
fresh it's like a fresh but warming and
homely sent I can't even explain it it's
very different to anything else I've
smelled so I recommend going in store
give it a sniff because it could be a
love-hate thing I personally love it and
love the mint part of it such a nice
fresh scent to have in your home so I've
been loving the home spray sorry if I'm
looking a little bit pale and bright
it's very hard to balance the light when
it's such a dull gloomy day outside but
the next product is from Estee Lauder
and I can't believe I haven't really
spoken much about this because I just
finished an entire tube and when I got
my new on I thought I really should talk
about this mall because I absolutely
love it it's just become so part of my
daily routine that it I've just
forgotten about it really it's the Estee
Lauder CC cream and I use this every
single day I use a small squeeze and I
mix it with my foundation I know that
some people I know Anna uses I think
just by itself all over the skin which
is really nice as well I like to mix it
with my foundations because I feel like
it makes the foundation even more Julie
and blendable and has a slight tint to
it as well so I feel like it gives me a
slight tan just takes the edge off a
little bit i love it i finished an
entire tube i'm on to my second one and
it's a great product I feel like CC
creams one of those things you think
what does that really do I really know
what it does but does something great
whatever it is makes your skin just
glowy and lovely I'm not going to talk
too much about these because I've been
banging on about
can be arranged in so many videos you
guys know I'm so impressed with it but
if I had to pick one thing from the rage
that I've tried my favorite thing so far
are the cream eyeshadows I have two one
is a slightly warm brown ones a slightly
cooler kind of topi brown I will write
the names within down below because
they're so small I can't even read them
but these are great I don't feel like I
need to repurchase my estee lauder
chained cream eyeshadow which is my
all-time favorite because I think this
is so so similar it's like slightly mu
see you I comply with a flat brush and
blend out and it lasts all day without
creasing they're so great they've got
proper lids so I feel like they weren't
dry out I'm just the quality of these
aren't real so if you like cream
eyeshadows especially the warm brown one
it's so so pretty then go and check out
H&amp;amp;M beauties range they've got quite a
few shades as well I always have a
couple of lipsticks floating around my
handbags and this month it's definitely
been these two and I've been her
swapping between both of them the first
one is from Laura Mercier and tanya burr
mention her video that she wore this on
her wedding day and I thought well if
she wore this on her wedding day it must
be amazing what a recommendation I love
buying things that youtubers that i
watch recommend so I went to get it it's
called spiced rose it's by laura mercier
and it's such a pretty color it's
slightly darker on me so it's not quite
kind of nude or neutral but it's like a
slightly Rosie brownie tone it's so
autumnal beautiful I'm not wearing it
right now I'm wearing Charlotte Tilbury
Bond girl which I love this isn't my
creamy so it's so easy to air during the
day and I've been wearing this like
everyday i absolutely love it so i'm
really glad i take that up thanks for
the recommendation tanya and then x1 is
from Clarins and it's called tea rose I
hear try that pretty much all of the
lipsticks in this range and this was
definitely my favorite it's a bit
different other shades that I where it's
like a nude neutral but it's slightly
more pink it's quite a pale pink
actually but I like to blend in with my
finger just so it's not too like out
there and it's really pretty it's just
slightly more fresh than the Laura
Mercier lipstick so when i'm having like
a real kind of no makeup makeup day and
i want something a bit more neutral this
one's really pretty and those two or
what i've been wearing all months very
easy lipsticks okay so now for some non
beauty stuff the first thing i've been
loving is this you might think what the
hell is this it's on oliver bonas and
you basically rest it on your desk and
you can put paper
so anything in there I keep a lot of
press releases and documents and letters
that I kind balls to open because
they're full of bank statements and I'd
pile them all in here and it looks
really pretty on my desk in its copper
and lovely so I like the whole range
from oliver bonas of stuff like that so
definitely go there if you want kind of
desk stationery stuff I've also got an
online series a TV series and a film to
recommend so that on my series is the
Alexa Chung and vogue series it was on
the British Vogue youtube channel and I
think it was a brilliant concept an idea
really well-executed it was maybe like a
five-part series they've now uploaded it
as one big hour-long special so I will
link that down below Alexa Chung is the
presenter and it's all about the fashion
industry how you can get into it all the
different jobs that come around the
fashion industry because not just about
kind of being a designer or sitting on
the front row there's so many little
jobs and it makes it really easy to
understand and really accessible for
people who just love fashion but maybe
don't love the kind of glitzy side of it
Alexa time it's great I think she's such
a good presenter you can tell that she
just pushed aside any script she was
given and just did her own thing I think
she's hilarious she's got such a great
personality I love her so go and check
out that series i think it was a really
good move on vogues part and i really
enjoyed watching it i watched every
episode as it was uploaded TV show i
would definitely recommend is now cos i
think i'm saying that right me and rich
just finished it it's on netflix and
it's all about the Colombian drug lord
Pablo Escobar and it's so so interesting
you just don't learn about things like
that in school and I can't really
believe it's real but it is and it's so
gripping we were watching like two or
three episodes at time so go if you have
netflix definitely definitely watch it I
also saw the film suffragette two nights
ago and I really enjoyed it over my
sister again it's something you learn
around school you don't really relate to
or fully understand and they finally
made a proper film about suffragettes
and it's so interesting it's so like I
came out feeling quite angry but I feel
like that's a good thing when it films
done really well you it kind of evokes
emotion I would really recommend see in
it and make your boyfriend and husband
and brother go and see it too because
rich wouldn't see it with me I'm really
annoyed about that the storyline is just
incredible it's kind of based on a true
story but they've also built some
characters
round it and yeah it's a really
emotional film so those are all my
favorites this month that you guys
enjoyed seeing what products I've been
loving and TV shows and stuff let me
know if you've been enjoying any films
or TV shows recently I'm always looking
to try new things and I will see you on
Tuesday for my weekly vlog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
