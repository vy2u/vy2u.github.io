favorites so as usual there's a bit of a
mix between beauty style and some random
favorites and I'm gonna start with the
first and most obvious one because I've
been talking about this product all
month I've become a little bit obsessed
and it's the new YSL youth liberator
serum foundation this is a new launch
for wire sell and I wasn't excited about
it when I first saw it but the moment I
tried it I knew it was love I've done a
full review of this on my blog with
pictures and everything so I'll link
that below it's a slightly higher
coverage than most foundations I use I
am wearing it today and it just gives a
really flawless finish for what I love
about it is that it gives this amazing
glow and it's not jewy it's all it's not
like wet or tacky you don't look shiny
but you look glowy I can't even explain
it it's nothing like anything else I've
tried it is quite pricey but seriously I
swear this is so worth it it's
definitely become like one of my top
five foundations maybe even my favorite
Stephanie my favourite at the moment
that's why it's in this video but I'm
obsessed with it I apply it using my
Real Techniques buffing brush and just
buff it into the skin it's really quick
to apply that's what I really like about
it it doesn't take long to blend in at
all I used b30 which is a perfect color
match for me and I've worn this every
day for the last month literally nothing
else I love it
the next Beauty favorite is one I think
a lot of people are going to mention
this month and it's from SES new autumn
winter collection and it's after school
boy blazer and this is a really really
dark navy blue it's almost black but in
certain lights you can see that it's
blue and I love navy blue as I mentioned
I think I talked about this in my last
video yeah my autumns the whole guide
video which you saw last week I've
already spoken about this so you know
all about it but I've been wearing this
on my nails pretty much every day this
month and today I have one of the other
shades from this collection actually
which is however what it's called it's
something Essie cardigan twinset maybe
something like that but other than that
I've been wearing this most days and
yeah I love it I've already told you I
love it don't know why I'm still going
on about this I'm gonna throw in one of
my random favorites now and it's pretty
random the Cadbury's Dairy Milk
pebbles chocolate and I think it's
obvious why I love these
they're called pebbles seriously I was
one of those kids that went on holiday
and could never find a bracelet with
their name on so to have chocolates that
have the same name is my very unusual
middle name
I literally when I saw these I think
someone tweeted them to me first and
then my boyfriend bought them back from
work and they're amazing so not only do
they have the best name but they're
actually really really nice doctors I'm
going to open them now because I
flattened mini eggs they taste for
expertise but they're bigger oh no
mm-hmm
they are so good so if you haven't tried
pebbles yet go and get some from your
newsagent
or petrol station or wherever they're
amazing oh and I have that chocolate
taste in my mouth and I want to eat the
whole pack they're very addictive but
yeah chocolates named after me I'm just
gonna pretend they're named after me I
know they're not but let's pretend my
next beauty favorite is an old favorite
that just comes back every year and it's
the eccentric molecule molecule oh one
perfume if you haven't heard me talk
about this before it's a slightly
strange perfume that has one molecule in
so it smells slightly different on
everyone and it kind of adjusts your
skin you can't really smell it on
yourself but other people are very drawn
to it
it's very weird and I've said in another
video that I had someone once chased me
down the train platform to ask me what
perfume I'm wearing so it obviously
works and I love that kind of musky
smell and it's perfect for autumn/winter
so although I didn't wear it much during
summer it's come back out again and I've
been wearing every day for the last
month and I loved it and I definitely
recommend going to try it if you have
one you can buy it on cult Beauty but if
you're in London you can get at
Liberty's if you want to try it first
and I've been using the shower gel
actually that goes with it and it really
helps kind of bring the scent out I just
love this perfume so if you read my
website you would have seen this scarf
already but this is definitely a
favorite this month and it's Mazzara
tartan scarf it's huge it's like a
blanket it's got kind of greeny ready
tartan on one side and then black and
white on the other and seriously when I
say it's huge it is huge
and I love it it's so cozy I'm a bit
obsessed tartan at the moment this was
the first tartan thing I bought and I
thought about four things since look at
it it's huge it's so warm
and soft and cozy I love Zara scarfs I
always buy like one amazing service
scarf a year I've been wearing it most
days this month and it's just really
cozy I'll link below where you can get
on the Zara websites but I also did a
blog post on it so I'll link that below
as well my next beauty favorite is by
Sarah Chapman it's a skincare product
and it's her overnight facial I think
I've mentioned this in a video before
I'm not sure but it's one of my favorite
steps in my skincare routine it is an
overnight oil so I tend to use this on
the nights where I can't be bothered to
moisturize I cleanse my skin and then I
just wanna go to bed I can't be bothered
for everything else so I just use this
and it's a really luxurious oil you just
need one pump and it's enough to work
over your whole face and as soon as you
put it on you can feel it just like
sinks into your skin and plumps up your
skin and feels amazing I can't even
describe it the smells are not that
great it smells quite like organic e
earthy but it instantly makes your skin
look glowing and feel amazing and I wake
up the next day and my skin is just so
good so I love using that I've actually
been kind of skipping the whole
moisturizing eye cream every single step
and just doing that instead a lot at the
moment because it's it's even more kind
of moisturizing and really good for the
colder month okay my last favorite is a
round one and it's gonna be quite hard
to explain but bear with me I'm going to
try it's an app and it's called heads up
it's made by Ellen DeGeneres who it's
just hilarious I love her I'm gonna try
to get it up for my phone here it's a
game it's really good to play with a
group of people all my friends making
noises now there are quite a few
categories there's superstar actor out
animals gone wild blockbuster movies
icons legends and stars accents and
impressions and hey mister DJ it's
basically like different versions of
charades so hey mister DJ you have to
hum any song that comes on sure ours is
act it out there's accents and then
there's people we have to describe them
you basically select the category and
then hold it up to your head and whilst
you're doing that it's filming everyone
else who's doing the charades so I'll
try and show you here you hold up to
your head and the the category comes up
of what it is so that's putting on a
band aid so then everyone has to try and
max it out and if you get it right you
go down
think and if you want to policy go up
and it kind of sounds quite simple but
it's the most hilarious thing in the
world last time I played this I was with
rich and Anna and her boyfriend and we
were in a Botanical Gardens in Cambridge
I think and Anna and Mark had to act out
putting on a nappy and I've never
laughed so much in my life it was
hilarious I love the show odds on the
most but having to describe people is
also quite funny it is American so there
are a few times of things come up and
you don't really know who they are but I
like it because like it's not like the
typical sure odds funny things come up
that you wouldn't normally see in the
sure odds game and it's just hilarious
so if you have any long train journeys
or anything like that it's the perfect
distraction and it just makes me laugh
so much it's such a funny game so enough
rambling about games but I hope you
enjoyed seeing all my favorites this
month I think it's a good little
selection and sorry for the bummed up
sounding voice throughout this video as
you can tell I have a little bit of a
cold typical for this time of year thank
you guys so much for watching and I'll
see you all next week bye so this is a
new little video series on my channel
and hopefully if you guys like it or do
one for every season it's basically a
little style guides</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
