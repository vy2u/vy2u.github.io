monthly makeup routine sorry that I
missed last month's makeup routine but I
was moving and I wasn't really wearing
much makeup so I'm back into wearing
makeup again this month I love autumn
it's my favorite time of year I love the
makeup and the tones and the colors and
now that I've got my makeup storage all
set up I'm kind of back into trying new
products that I'm excited about makeup
again so I'm just gonna do the sort of
makeup I've been wearing recently again
a very similar look that I like to wear
but using quite a few different products
so I hope you guys enjoy this I'm gonna
start with the soap &amp;amp; Glory one heck of
a block primer this is new and it says
that it's mattifying but I actually
think it's quite hydrating it's
definitely fine for people with dry skin
tights it's kind of somewhere in between
but it's not too silicone II I don't
really like that in a primer I prefer
when it feels hydrating so I was
actually quite surprised when I read
that this was for all oily skin types
who want a matte finish because it
doesn't really feel matte to me it feels
quite hydrating I like just apply this
in the center of my face before I did my
makeup for my foundation I'm going to
use the new L'Oreal true match
foundation
I've always liked this foundation but
they've recently updated the formula
they've added more oils in it so it's
more blendable they'd added new pigments
so it's a bit more glowy and they've
also added a few new shades as well I
already loved this foundation but I much
prefer the new formula because it's just
a bit more hydrating doesn't have that
kind of cakiness that the old one had
slightly just going to use my Bobbi
Brown full coverage face brush just to
blend that in and I like wearing these
sort of foundations during the autumn in
the summer I'm all about the kind of BB
CC creams and you don't have to kind of
amp up your foundation if you don't want
to I tend to it just depends what I'm
doing if I'm just at home or I'm just
seeing family I'll carry on wearing my
BB CC creams both I'm going out I just
love these kind of foundations it blends
in so easily this one much better than
the old one the old one used to slightly
sit on top of the skin I'm sorry if the
light isn't great there's a huge window
there and I'm struggling with the whole
light situation because when I use
artificial lights I just think that it's
a bit useless when doing my makeup
because you can't really see it so
hopefully natural light is okay for you
guys I'm just gonna quickly do my
concealer and I'm still using the
Charlotte Tilbury
my favorite concealer but I ended up
buying shade three as well because I
feel like this is a better match to my
actual skin so what I tend to do at the
moment they should do a couple of clicks
of number two and I put that Rhynie
inside of my eye just where I'm really
really dark it may be a little bit on
the outside as well and then I use
number three everywhere else I really
hope that she brings out kind of a
peachy tone concealer because that would
be great for under the eye but I really
like this concealer and three is
definitely a better match for me they
now sell Charlotte Tilbury and Phoenix
so it's much easier to get hold of if
you can't get Selfridges I know when you
buy it from Phoenix my mom just texted
me actually asking me what concealer she
should buy and I told her definitely get
this one I think she'll love it I feel
like my dark circles a really dark at
the moment whenever I get my makeup done
my makeup artist they always leave it
just like this and they seem to think
it's fine I don't know if I'm just
seeing something that no one else has
seen but I'm gonna add a tiny bit of
makeup forever full cup of concealer
just here
okay concealers done I'm now gonna do
some bronzer I'm still using the soap
and glory solar powder I have no need to
change because I love this bronzer
although I would say that I tried one
from H&amp;amp;M BC that I really liked I'm
gonna use something else from HLN's new
Beauty range today I'm just gonna you
know apply that like a normal bronzer to
outer parts of my face nothing like
super bronzy just to kind of slightly
sculpt my face this rmk brush is so soft
before I move on to blush and
highlighter I'm just gonna quickly do my
brows using the Anastasia brow Wiz just
slightly filling in the inner parts and
then slightly filling in the arch where
it kind of dips a bit and then I'm using
the Loreal clear brow gel which I
mentioned in my boots haul that I'm not
really a fan of but I'm gonna use it
until it's finished
I wouldn't want to waste it rub it down
so it doesn't get too crispy okay for
blush I'm using this one which is from
Charlotte Tilbury and it's called a sex
on fire these blushes just make me laugh
because they just well they just look
like nipples really let's be honest I'm
gonna put a little bit out on my cheeks
it's nice it's kind of like a movie pink
if you use a lot of the middle shade
it's like a nice move which is really
nice for autumn and then I'm gonna use
this highlighter from Chanel which is
koop do me know II mean we
I don't know it's in French but this is
part of their Christmas collections it's
not out yet
it's a beautiful highlighter that I've
been testing out so that I'll just use
it in this video it's just so kind of
soft it's not at all like glittery
you're not probably not going out to
pick it up on the camera but I feel like
this just adds kind of light rather than
shimmer that's beautiful
they call it a blush maybe it to be a
blush I'm just using it as a highlighter
oh it's so nice you want to put that all
over my face okay eyes before I do my
eye shadow which is gonna be very simple
I'm just gonna use the Tarte
inner rim liner that's a really horrible
name
I hate the word rim sorry this video is
taking a turn for the worse I'm
basically gonna put this in the inner
part of my eye and it makes any redness
which I have because I've just woken up
it turns the redness into like a nude
skin at tone color which therefore makes
you look less tired some of them can be
a bit too nude and I think it looks a
bit weird this one seems to be I haven't
tried this yesterday this one seems to
be good very soft you hardly have to
touch perfect that's just done exactly
what I need it today okay then I'm gonna
take this product from H&amp;amp;M Beauty H&amp;amp;M
have started a beauty range I was so
pessimistic that's the word I really
wasn't kind of bothered about I don't
know I think I was being a bit snobby
about it if I'm honest I just thought
H&amp;amp;M I always think like why try and do
something that you're not necessarily
specialized it and I love their clothes
they could have just left it at that I'm
gonna be honest that was my opinion then
I try some of the stuff oh my god it's
so good literally I say like 9 out of 10
things I tried I was so impressed with I
don't know who's behind it someone
clearly who knows their stuff is behind
this brand so I definitely want to go
into H&amp;amp;M and try some more stuff but for
now I'm gonna use this cream eyeshadow
which is cold I'm so blind Sirico it's
just like a brown eyeshadow cream but
it's so so nice it's stayed I wore
yesterday stayed all day didn't crease
and it's lovely so I'm just gonna use a
zoeva brush I'm gonna Pat that onto the
eye I'm really enjoying just wearing
warm brown tones all over the lid and
then just mascara oh my god that looks
really heavy
I'm applied to slide it differently than
I did yesterday I show you use a flat
brush really I'm just gonna blend out
the edges it blends so
so soft I'm gonna take a smaller brush
and apply it under the eye I literally
love this eyeshadow if this was slightly
what oranjee it would be just like Estee
Lauder changed cuz it's slightly moussey
definitely gonna go into H&amp;amp;M and see
what else they have I was gonna use
another eyeshadow just the deepen it up
but decided not to you I'll show you
anyway what I was going to use because I
really like this palette it's from Tanya
burr cosmetics and it's her Hollywood
eye palette this is a great dupe for the
Charlotte Tilbury chavita or the Tom
Ford cognac sable it's got four shades
in it a light highlight a light golden
kind of medium brown and then a golden
glitter really really nice very
affordable I'm not gonna use that was
going to use the brown in the crease but
I actually don't think it needs it so
I'm just gonna apply mascara and I
really like that kind of simple I look
at the moment this is from Clinique it's
not the high impact extreme volume that
I always use it's the high impact
waterproof mascara and I sure didn't
even realize this was waterproof but I
just really like this it just gives
really nice kind of curl and length and
not too much volumes that's kind of most
my mascaras and very like they give a
lot of volume whereas this I feel like
it's more of a natural look okay I'm not
gonna put some scar on the bottom lash
looking it might be a bit much so I'm
just leaving it there and then the final
thing is lipstick this I mentioned as
well I think in my boots hauls from Mac
it's called fast play it's the hydrating
creamy version of Mac Mayer which I was
obsessed with the still am obsessed with
but I used it a lot in you guys seem to
really like it very similar color it's
just this is an amplified formula so
it's a bit kind of more creamy but it's
still really like intense color so easy
to apply it doesn't drag at all and the
slight plummy pink color is just so
perfect for autumn this is definitely my
new favorite MAC lipstick it looks quite
dark on camera it's not really that dark
in real life and also I just put it on
it will kind of dive down a bit that's
the look oh my god I really need my hair
cut I'm gonna book in actually today for
a haircut I keep forgetting it's getting
to that kind of awkward slightly too
long it needs like that much off okay
so I hope you guys enjoyed this look let
me know what you think I know it's super
simple but I think it's
nice and what I've been wearing a lot
recently thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
