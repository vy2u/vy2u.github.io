for you guys I'm in a different room
because my room that I normally film in
is really hot and cramped and I've
already filmed this video once and it
came out really badly I don't know I
just fancied kind of changing rooms and
seeing if it helped give me motivation
to film and it has I'm feeling much
better in this room so I'm going to show
you what I bought I went to a new store
called and other stories and it's owned
by the same people who are in H&amp;amp;M and
cos and they've just opened their first
store in London on Regent Street and I
found out about this through make I'm
gonna link her blog post below because
she did a really good post about the
shop and I'd never heard of it before
that so um she did a post and then
instead of Jen from beauty junkie London
so I'll link both of those below but I
love H&amp;amp;M I love cause hmm
sometimes stuffs are not that nice and
cause I love it all but it's too
expensive for me this is supposed to be
an in-between shop so I was really
excited to go and have a look and it was
so nice and it's quite a big shop the
one in London it's two floors there's
beauty and fashion the clothes are a
little bit expensive but there's
definitely some affordable pieces as
well and the beauty section amazing they
give you a little basket to go around
put all the things you like in it which
is really nice they have their own brand
and a few other brands as well I also
really like I noticed that they kind of
scatter the beauty products around the
shop so they'll put a nail polish and a
blusher near the clothes that it sort of
goes with officially what I got it was
mainly Beauty I was quite overwhelmed
when I went there I'm gonna go back and
look at the clothes but beauty's easy to
buy obviously so I got quite a few bit
first thing I've got which I saw Meg
worried about and made me desperately
want to go and have a look at them is
the fig fiction body wash and hand soap
I just run out of my hand safe in my
bathroom so I needed another one anyway
and this smells amazing it smells
exactly like the diptych Philosopher's
syringe and I absolutely love fig smells
so really forced trying these and I
really like the simple packaging as well
I think it's really chic and apparently
make said if you take back the empty
packaging they give you ten percent off
your next purchase which is really good
so these smell amazing the hand soap was
four pounds and the body wash was five
I think it's really reasonable it's more
like hmm prices the next thing I got was
a makeup bag it looks like this I really
like the ones from whistles but they're
really expensive and I've been waiting
for an acyl different code to buy one
then I saw this I really like it
the material is a bit funny it's like a
kind of sports material iPhone me but I
really like orangey colors got big I
literally jumped out of my hands it's
got as it goes all the way across and
then inside is just black it says and up
the stories which i think is really nice
and that was seven pounds which i think
is very reasonable and i think that's
nice if i want to carry us and put us
around in my handbag i also picked up
two nail polishes i was good i only got
two there's so many amazing colors and
they put them all on like lollipop
sticks to show you the swatches that the
colors there's so many nice colors but i
don't need any more nail polishes i have
so many so i just got to the first one
is 12 blue and i got this because i
thought it looked like a really good
dupe for nails inc baker streets it's
like a bright electric blue so I'm gonna
give that a go and if it is then maybe
I'll do look blog post on it because
that's the color I've always wanted to
try but nails ink isn't cheap as you
know so and these nail polishes are only
five pounds which i think is quite good
as well the other color I got is I don't
know how to say it but more green I
think something like that and it's a
really pale past early green which I
just think it's really pretty especially
for like spring and summer so I'm
looking forward to seeing what the
quality of these are like because they
are 5 pounds which is quite cheap and
then there's just two more things and
this is from it's not from the and Other
Stories brand it's from another brand
that they sell there I'm not sure
exactly how to pronounce it but I think
it's la brew k or brew kit something
like that I think it's Swedish maybe and
I've got some bath salts I really like
this really simple packaging it comes in
this little bag
neither into three pounds and I really
like bath salts and they last quite a
long time so so that's quite a good deal
I have no idea what scent they are
because they're all packaged up and it's
not in English so I will let you know if
these are really good then I'll
definitely go and walk through pounds is
really good price I think and then the
last thing is from the same brand as
that one and it's a candle and let me
take out this
I love candles and I just finished
candles so I allowed myself to buy a new
one this was 17 pounds so is the most
expensive thing that I bought but it's a
candle I think it's worth it well I'll
let you know when I burn it
but it looks like this it's in a really
nice glass jar so I thought would be
really nice to keep when it's finished
and I got the lavender one there were a
few cents I love love and it's just so
relaxing and calming and I just think
this will smell so nice when it's
burning love it smells like a bath so
yeah I really like that lavender candle
as well and that's everything I bought
so very small little mini haul but I
thought I'd show you because I think
it's quite interesting it's a new shop
in London and if you live in London I'd
really recommend going to visits it's
really nice kind of shopping experience
in there and if you're visiting London
then go and take a look as well if not
they definitely have some in I don't
know where they are but I'll put the
link to their website below and you can
see where that other stores are as well
but it's really really nice and I'm
definitely going to go back so I hope
you like seeing what I bought and thank
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
