things you need to know about this vlog
I'm gonna say the word excited a lot
we're probably gonna squeal a lot but
let's go woo
Judgment Day with the local time here
he's half past 5:00 in the afternoon ok
so we landed and we just got the hotel
room and I wasn't really gonna vlog
until the excitement tomorrow but oh my

of us out here which is so nice of them
I haven't been here since I was about 7
and I was in a buggy rich has never been
just being on a nine and a half hour
flight and it was all right actually but
it was long I'm probably look horrendous
we're gonna freshen up and go downstairs
to dinner
I might vlog a bit and show you guys who
else is here but I'll probably start the
vlog properly tomorrow morning guys we
woke up the half 5:00 this morning this
is obviously what it feels like to be a
morning person it's quite good but yeah
the jet lag is real we are gonna be
really tired tonight we tried to stay
asleep as long as we could but half five
was as long as we could stay asleep for
rich has actually gone to the gym to
work out with Leon and John and I've
just been getting ready slowly which is
nice John and Leon from the lean
machines are here Victoria from in the
fur is here with her boyfriend Alex and
Lucy and Lydia the twins are here too
and it's such a nice group of people we
really kind of bonded really quickly and
we got separated on the plane and we're
all like oh no and they were gonna take
this round Disney in couples but last
night at dinner we all said can we just
stay together please and because it's a
really nice to give people I think I
have really fun a few days with them so
I start introduce everyone hey Lydia how
we know it's Lydia cuz she's got a
longer hair longer name
Victoria my boyfriend Alex totally rich
and then John and Leon are over there
everyone's logging please go get some
breakfast
you
my first thought is the magic kingdom
John and I are enjoying a beautiful
sunshine involving a song as it should
but what it feels like to Sun my skin
our ears were very happy well most of us
for is rich but weird hat and John got a
double heart
Alex O'Keefe we have with ease
I'm going on my first ride I hate rides
I'm normally the one that sits in the
bag okay it's always mental case so I'm
sure I don't answer so brave now I face
it it would ruin my whole chair but
controller
okay now headed to a haunted mansion
which I think everyone's kind of sucked
out my level is now and they say that I
can do this
so we had spaghetti and meatballs like
we didn't do the spaghetti you go would
have been bad table manners actually
dogs off
now we're heading back to the motel
because you want to go in the pool
prepared as a slide and I'm so up for
that we had such a fun day today at the
Magic Kingdom and then we came back and
we had a little bit of spare time so he
went down to the pool pool is a little
bit cold so we actually sand the jacuzzi
had a beer and I was so happy I
literally was saying this is like the
happiest I've been in a long time we
just had a chat spoke about tattoos it
was great now we're gonna go out for
dinner where she means Epcot
and I think we're going to a really nice
pizza place
we just had dinner and now we're gonna
watch the Illuminations firework display
we've been given these glasses that when
you put them on or basically see Mickey
everywhere I see me
those fireworks were insane when you
look through them you see like my mouth
they were such a bitter light and it
just made firings but there's so much
better I really enjoyed that so you guys
enjoy that scientific just go back to
the hotel and we're gonna sit and have
some drinks and play heads up and then
head to bed hello blocks and more
adventures tomorrow see ya so today we
have quite a busy itinerary actually
this is what we're doing so doing it for
breakfast and then we are going to the
Disney's Grand Floridian Resort where
some of us are going to a spa not mean
rich we are instead going on these
little like mini speedboats it should be
fun it leaves me rich and John and Leigh
on em we're gonna go on these boats and
I think it'll prolly be hilarious those
two are just making me laugh a lot on
this little trip we're looking forward
to today I'm so hungry so we're gonna go
have some breakfast
I literally can't take my Minnie Mouse
ears off I love them so much
but I'm very aware that I have bought
such boring clothes of me the twins
always look so cute and Victoria is
literally like a ball of pink purple
fluff it's so funny she looks like she
could work at Disney whenever we were
like watching the parade or the
characters are like oh my god I love
your purple hair it's so funny everyone
it doesn't he just loves Victoria so
yeah this is me and my gray t-shirt and
jeans so we have our own special van
today just me rich John and Leon cuz
we're getting on some boats who said you
guys like my new sunglasses they are the
Ray Ban Erica's with some sunglasses
shop and I really like them they're very
lightweight they're lighter than my
other sunglasses
I like the shape I think by reading
glasses would look nice at the shape -
I'm really worried about falling out
labony
getting eaten by an alligator it would
make a good story then I definitely get
to make sure we're all going our own
boats and the boys have been mean
because I scared of being eaten by an
alligator they did the cutest straps
this is just the side of my face and I'm
like awesome - like the man-made was a
non man-made once a rich goes off so the
alligators are in the non man may want
it
we just had so much fun they go really
fast and I was time apparently so they
said oh you Lily and I think I'm gonna
be scared everyone telling me it's not
scary my buddies
okay so the car ride was really fun but
now everyone's gone on this one much
additional space mission space which
apparently is nice and of thing and like
spins and it just sounds like my work
I'd definitely be sick but watching
other people come out and like I'm going
to came out Basel told his wife he's
been throwing up he's a sweaty so I'm
looking forward to seen they will make
out alive okay we're going on soaring
now and then hopeful Finding Nemo this
one pine used if you go quite high but
it's not really movie so I think almost
actually really fun and they pumped out
smells like when you go over the orange
field it's my orange we're pretty high
that was like my stream but they're
always really good and now I can we
gonna quickly go on Finding Nemo ride
and then we're gonna head back okay so
we're now ready to go out for dinner
we're now heading back to that Floridian
hotel for quite posh tin or I think in
then we're watching a fireworks display
like we did last night but this one I
think we're watching it from a boat and
her thing about desert parties which are
pretty excited about I'm just having
such a great time or just like talking
with my sister on whatsapp and they're
all so jealous they want to come so I
think you might have to make a family
trip back here soon actually our guide
Matt was saying how they're doing a deal
for people from UK and Ireland where
it's like two weeks for the price of one
so I'm all over that I'm nice to my
sisters because the kids would love it
here
you ready yeah they can fly whoo that
click the click point also I haven't
shown you guys this like a bracelet
which basically you can use this to get
into your room and you can use it as
like a fast pass on the rides and
basically you can put you can like my
little credit card
seeing pay for things on it it's amazing
and you got it a little bling to make it
look all pretty I've got some bling on
mine I've got the blue which actually
has bling on him we're loving these
bracelets I feel so powerful it's like
buzzing everything on my bracelet
but we've really gotta go for dinner but
we take your loads of photos and waste
of one's time
right now we're going to watch the
fireworks from the boat and have lots of
desserts and drink
violets are absolutely beautiful and I
love the audio and piece in the piece
climb on it makes me cry I didn't cry
Lucifer it should and I was I was good
on the boat I did myself
Ziggy now day to done I am so tired
again it's hard to make it through these
evenings I'm gonna go to sleep and then
I'll see you guys tomorrow
so I've split off from the group for a
bit because they've gone on some Everest
right I don't know that's why I should
come shopping cause I wanted to pick up
a few beep 80 bits my target which there
might be talking also hard to find I go
to New York a lot but there aren't
really many there so I thought while I'm
here I'll pop in I just walk I spend 120
dollars in the target which is
ridiculous but there's loads of new
stuff and I want to try it and now I'm
going to try and find old sir because I
think they do Dirac which is again
really hard to find I've absolutely no
idea where I am
I've asked everyone what altar is and
they said they never heard of it we
should spit waited so I'm gonna go over
to Mall of millenia see if it's over
there and try find Sephora as well and
then I'm gonna meet up again with the
gang
so it menses for because I'm in such a
rush I spent so much money dude what's
wrong with you like revise eyeshadow
palettes and lipsticks like liquid
lipsticks but I'm now trying to head to
alter okay so I didn't quite make it to
alter that lorac palette I swear I will
never be mine I tried
don't I get busted amazing trying to I
get why they're at the parts the
Caribbean right
make my way
I found the group again and I just
inhaled a hot dog okay so we came back
to the hotel to get ready and now we're
gonna head to John or Leon's room we're
not sure who and sit on the balcony have
a few beers before we go out tonight we
are going sorry tonight the afternoon
we're going to Hollywood with Disney's
Hollywood Studios where there's a few
more riots and cool stuff there and then
I think we're going straight out for
dinner from there thinking back to
earlier when I was shopping is making me
laugh it was like supermarket sweet but
literally was just running and grabbing
anything they look good
so I probably missed a lot and I
probably bought a lot of stuff I didn't
need as well okay we're at Hollywood
Studios and although everyone has gone
on this Aerosmith ride which is like the
rock and roll ride that's like this
and I'm obviously not going on that one
spent a really scary so I'm gonna go
into the gift shop while I wait for them
this whole trip up being like kind of
casually saying I'm gonna try corn dog I
didn't really realize they were real
thing for they were just in films and
Matt like one of our guys I didn't even
really spend the last 20 minutes
searching for a corn dog for me just so
quality and sweet though apparently just
come around the pool
my corn dog I'm kind of nervous later
we just had dinner and now we're gonna
sleep in the Toy Story ride for everyone
I'm a chef I was lame
display we've gotta keep viewing and
apparently this is way better than the
fireworks a lie which we're amazing work
seen S&amp;amp;P way nothing is more powerful
than the imagination
experience fantastic
jury BR through one imagination
that was amazing definitely the best
show we've seen so far it's really hard
to show on camera but it's like water
like with like a water
thank you what's a projection show
things that cut yourself it's really
good
so we're all packed up and ready to go
which is case and my case I'm so sad to
be leaving but we've seriously had the
best time anything that ended my vlog
properly last night but we had a really
good time watching the Fantasmic show I
think that was definitely the best show
yet I think today we're just going to
the shopping malls and then we're
heading home it's felt like much longer
than four days and it really has felt
like a two-week holiday and we've got to
know everyone so well in the group has
been lovely our tour guides for the
whole trip have been amazing definitely
up there my top ten holidays of all time
I've had a great time maybe you guys

this is gonna be a really long slog
however days to kind of recover tomorrow
