of a YouTube drama two of my videos went
up instead of one and then I lost the
thumbnail for one and I literally like
got out of bed although hungover
stressed by YouTube and I'm sitting at
my desk but it's vlogmas day 606 with
honor
here I think I fixed all the dramas a
little bit of a sudden way to wake up
this morning but my birthday video is
going down really well
oh if you haven't yet seen it go check
it out it's I did make a nice thumbnail
but then I lost it anyway it's called 28
my birthday video comedy community 28 my
birthday's on Wednesday it's not yet but
I'm like reflecting on 28 great things
that happened this is my last birthday
and it took me ages to make so I'm so
glad it's going down well now me and
rich are starving we're still hanging a
bit and my phone loads of makeup because
I kind of need it to last till tonight
if I can I might have to redo it but
hopefully not I think we're gonna try
and go to the Breakfast Club it's
unlikely I've never walked past there
when there isn't a queue and it's Sunday
so I think there's gonna be a mega queue
but there's only two of us I feel like
there is hope and it's worth it for the
pancakes oh my god pancakes and bacon
okay so we go he's open I'm still not
opening the shots everyone cuz I just
don't know when I'm supposed to do
opening that is it 5 or 6 today 6 today
whoo J Malone body cream nice there's
gonna be a table at Breakfast Club I'm
getting her seriously excited now would
you fancy pancakes yeah
that makes one sausages Oh full English
this is Camden Passage and it's like one
of my favorite places in London for cute
little shops there's a little antique
market down here in a shop called home
and country and the right that I love
definitely come and check it out if
you're nearby that's home in pantry oh
it's beautiful this is the moment of
truth and it looks pretty busy down
there is there gonna be a huge queue oh
my god look at the queue
that's ridiculous we've been told it's
about half an hour wait it's not any
longer than that
finish breakfast I'm absolutely stuck I
didn't make it there I got the
all-american both said uh potatoes got
smashed avocado and it was so yummy do
you enjoy your breakfast I need to go
home and edit yesterday's vlog verse and
then we might go get I think before we
go home and I edit yesterday's vlog most
we're gonna go and suss out the tree
situation now we were gonna have this
guy deliver a tree because when I was at
my parents we always use this guy who
delivers treats to your house and it's
much cheaper than buying them in my
current place so we always did that but
we suddenly realize we don't know if we
can actually fit a real tree in our
flower because it's so small the space
where we could put a tree is like tiny
and real trees like go out really wide
so we're gonna go have a look at the
real tree like the smallest ones they
have apparently rich seems to think they
have some they're like potted so if we
can't get real one we will if not we
might have to get a home base and get
like a fake tree because I want
something I just don't know we're quite
ready for the real tree thing maybe when
we have a big house one day the problem
is if you get a really little one then
you kind of only see the skinny but if
the tree at the top which is the ugly
bit anyway cuz when I was at my parents
used to get like a six seven foot one so
you wouldn't really see the skinny
because it'll be high up but when
they're little will you see a little
skinny bit and they're not that full if
they're little cuz the bigger they get
the more Folio I'm gonna go to home base
and have a look at the fake trees and
see what they're like there are no
parking spaces and rich is in a lovely
mood on you how happy are you about this
hate when there's no parking
stupid why they're never not smooth I
can't handle this
right right guys that are filming what
are you Tory I have a feeling this is
truly might be a bit big there's a bit
big I think it's like quite a nice
little tree oh there's the fake tree
section I see what's going on over here
make it rich we need to go like in the
entrance to Christmas world these are
huge we can get a wooden tree this fake
on the bureau if we didn't have fake
droplets on it and then like let me I
like the droplets in the poos apparently
there's loads more real trees outside in
the garden sent a bit so let's go see
there's any little mini ones looks
promising
I think these potted ones are our best
bet but they're all a bit sideways ewwww
so we've got we've got this one which
has the nice thick thickness but it's
one key and then you've got these ones
but I don't really know if I like these
little skinny thank you
I think that's a nice little chewy it's
like pushy good hi I don't really like
the red pot but I think we can deal with
it we're just getting all emotional
astray aren't you keep saying so first
it's true you've definitely not enough
that it's gonna fit be positive put it
by the window let's go get it message
what should we name it spike
hi hi it's a Norway spruce we can put
him Norman we're gonna go get Mexico
by tree these kids knock you didn't tell
the other cheese we need to find
something to put on the top of the tree
I haven't got anything yet like a little
star we also need some lights we need
lights and a topper we bought some
lights I think I'm just going to
decorate the tree with what I've got and
then if I need more which I probably
will I'll just get in this tomorrow I'm
rather than over buying stuff
I hate tinsel I am literally the biggest
hater of tinsel ever so we're not having
any of that on our tree I've been sent
to the back seat is the Christmas trees
taking up the front seat richer said it
feels like we're taking our first baby
home I really hope our first baby isn't
so green and prickly it probably likely
to be that hairy though I'm gonna have
to refrain from decorating the tree
although I really wanted to do it now
because it's like what Abbas 3 and I
haven't even started editing the vlog
that needs to go up today so I'm feeling
really panicky about that I'm gonna do
it now and then we'll decorate the tree
and watch X Factor from last night and
I'm a celebrity get me out of there
it has become a little bit of a daily
vlog miss ritual where I edit my video
and then I always have to watch it
through once to check and rich watches
it through with me he never watches my
videos on every way they watch an
x-factor and I'm gonna start putting the
lights on the tree
just eating Katie thing a complete idiot
I'll be now to put lights on a tree this
is the most spiky tree I've ever
experienced in my life it is actually
hurting my hands
I'm just tying the little Cadbury's
chocolate so I'm so tempted to eat one I
might just have one and then we're gonna
hang them on the tree these are my
favorite tree decorations of all time
hey this is our tree might get a few
extra things I need to get something for
the top a nice star but you've got
twinkle lights we've got a bit of red a
bit of gold chocolates
we have riches or and my L we have the
stars from west down kind of sands back
around and it's the hmm like these ones
and these ones there's no H no I'm not
sure how I feel about those but it's
getting bigger there maybe I'll use that
and yeah I think at this pretty
Christmas tree I'm just waiting for the
video to process because I always forget
the Sunday nights really busy time when
YouTube so processing takes ages I don't
know if that's how it works but I've
made up that reason and watching I'm
celebrity get me out of it and it's the
celebrity cyclone when they were just a
superior isn't it like go on the slippy
slide ething I really want to do it how
fun does it look oh no I've got to
convince this guy to go to a wedding
tonight good luck to me so it's time to
get ready for wedding round two and I
think to the wedding today I was gonna
wear the dress yesterday but I don't
want over wear it so it's not special
for my friend's wedding and also rich
the white wine down the sleeve so smells
a little bit I'm gonna wear this dress
which was my Christmas party dress from
last year I think this on top shop it's
like a t-shirt dress oh no it's a sauce
it's like a t-shirt dress but it's quite
heavily embroidered the sequins so it is
a bit nicer than a t-shirt dress I
probably wear the same heels yesterday
night which is gonna drive so I won't
need to worry about the whole walking
and heels thing I'll just like throw
them on when I get there we're just
going to the party be at the wedding
which isn't till like 9:15 9:30 so we're
probably gonna go for dinner first to
get some food we're both feeling a bit
like Sunday mellow so I need to like get
back in the party mood I just got to
touch up my makeup really I did it quite
well this morning so that I wouldn't
have to redo it so I'm just gonna touch
up like the base products and my eyes a
little bit maybe put on like a festive
red blip the way my hair is done and
most of my makeup is done as well I
think I'm gonna go for a red lip and I'm
gonna use a matte red lip this is a new
one from Mac is the Dita Von Teese one I
think it's out on like the 17th of
December or something and I haven't
tried it yes I'm gonna give it a go
pretty sure it's matte and it just looks
like a really nice kind of quite a
bright red actually I don't know if I
see bright red I normally go for dark
red so let's give it a go I might use a
lip liner first that's the lipstick I
mean the lighting is terrible in here
but I really like it it's like a bright
red I don't we're gonna turn up it's
gonna be so dark and everyone be drunk
already anyway so don't know why I'm
making all the effort but it's nice to
try a new lipstick I'm gonna wear Stella
perfume tonight I'm packing my nice bag
again so I'm gonna have to switch over
to this camera
I'll see you in a minute we're going out
like this every were gonna go to pasar
Barry Thai and I feel like I mean I like
a van a humble up from an Austin Powers
and I think I'm gonna get some looks and
besar but your Thai rich tucking yeah
untucked so it's ready to rumble okay so
pretending to be happy for the vlog at
sorry
Lanie 70 non-smooth Christmas
alright News Alert richard has told me
he's got this thought of the day not
it's a rent of the day oh god your your
thoughts it very quickly turned into
rounds no no observations good - people
always think I'm the mone one says you
can join in all my patients because I
liked I'm very easygoing person I like
to think yeah and no nothing really
bothers me that much but cyclists I
first before I say anything I'm an
experienced cyclist I ride a lot and I
ride a lot in London so I get it I
understand traffic is a nightmare they
conflict between drivers and cyclists so
I see on both sides and I've been hit by
a car pretty badly and still like
luckily survived it so I've experienced
it but pretty much every time I go out
in my car and I Drive there's a cyclist
who are not wearing helmets they don't
wear have lights on they some reason
want to cycle in the middle of literally
in the middle of the road or in the
other side of the road and cause issues
for drivers I hate it it's like the
state where helmets I sat i shat on my
window wear a helmet yes you want to die
yeah and to be honest like they're not
giving us cyclists those types like this
and not giving us the prime example guy
here
wearing a helmet but no lights seriously
sort your lives out sorry
language I literally think people think
we've just sucked commissar psi this is
slightly embarrassing
okay we've come I always thought my
vlogs okay okay okay okay okay
viscosity yeah the mat time that edit
out okay what I've actually said okay
let's start this again we are now
outside the hotel but we're a bit early
and there's nothing more awkward than
arriving too early when people are still
eating dinner I'm not feeling great I
won't tell you in detail why just not
feeling great tonight so let's hope that
goes away and we're gonna go in soon
we're just gonna sit in the car and
chill and read some YouTube comments

his tie that's cool

much of this one I'm gonna be able to
vlog and his last night they like how to
