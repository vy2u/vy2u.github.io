come with a warning that I was going to
start looking like this but sometimes
you just got to start a vlog with no
makeup on I've been feeling a little bit
under the weather today nothing like
major I've just got like a bit of a cold
I'm a little bit sniffily so I've been
taking it easy my mom came over and made
me chicken soup which was very kind of
her I've just been chilling because I
have a really fun evening planned and I
wanted to feel good for her and I do
feel much better now than I did this
morning so I'm just getting ready for
tonight and I thought I'd just show you
my makeup while I put on I haven't done
this for a while just like a sit down
chatty makeup application thing
hopefully I will look a little bit
better once I am done I'm not gonna go
crazy well there there are some new
products I want to try I'm gonna start
putting on some makeup now and tell you
what I'm doing afterwards because that
means less time on camera looking like
this I've got sent some new stuff from
the Victoria Beckham Estee Lauder range
which I'm really crazy to try because
I've heard so much about this the
packaging is like very Victoria Beckham
it's very sleek very cool this is um
what is this the morning Oris it's like
illuminating cream look at this fancy
bottle oh my gosh that is beautiful I'm
gonna put some of this on as like a
primer it was quite white it's quite
like it looks like simulate the Tom Ford
one well it feels nice I think this I
haven't got like the prices on me I
think this is one of the more expensive
products I've been wearing the it
cosmetics CC cream every day for
absolutely months when I'm not wearing
this I'm wearing the Illamasqua skin
base but I just find this work for every
situation because it's it's kind of like
a tinted moisturizer so it's good for
the day but it's good coverage too so I
find that it works for like events and
evenings and stuff as well I'm still
using my Real Techniques complexion
sponge in case any of you watched my
Olympus PEN camera review and you
weren't really sure what I meant by the
screen right now my camera is resting on
a box and the screen is flipped up so I
couldn't do this right now with the
Olympus PEN camera and that's why I
still vlog on my canon g7x I'm also
gonna try the new Victoria Beckham Estee
Lauder bronzer I really want tried the
highlighter but it's like sold out
everywhere but I'm excited to try the
bronzer it looks like it's gonna be too
dark for me I'm going to take a lot of
it often
my hand I really like Victoria Beckham
can I just say she wasn't my favorite
tool when I was when I was a Spice Girls
fan I really didn't like her then but I
think she is a brilliant businesswoman
and I think it's very inspiring and I
think a lot of the Beckham success is
down to her rather than him and I think
she's she's very cool it's quite nice
maybe a little bit patchy as I said it's
a little bit too red tone for me a bit
warm for my blusher I'm gonna use the
Tanya burr cosmetics cheek illuminator
this is really pretty I'm just gonna
like dab that on my cheek and then I'm
just using another Real Techniques brush
to blend that in sticking with the creme
formulas I'm gonna use Mac hush as my
highlighter this is such a nice
highlighter I went to a pixie Wu event
last night and I was chatting to Nick
Chapman and she had there was incredible
highlights it was this mixed with a Tom
Ford thing I think I'm gonna try use on
a brush is such a pretty highlighter I'm
going to use some shades from my Mac
palette I recently kind of reorganized
this I might do a video on it I don't
know if it's a bit boring but this is my
this is one of my Mac palettes I took
out some of the more greeny shades and
I've made it a bit of a neutral palette
and I really like all the shades in here
the newest addition is this one up here
which is saddle and I'm going to use
that because I'm really enjoying it at
the moment so you guys this is why I
don't do that when you make up tutorials
anymore because I wear the same makeup
all the time okay mascara I'm gonna try
something new this is from Maybelline
it's the falsies push-up angel mascara
and the brush is really weird
quite doubtful I'm gonna like this
because look how crazy the brushes you
can kind of see it's like a plasticy
really weird mascara wand I'll know
pretty much straight away it gives a
very natural effect on the lashes which
is nice I guess like an everyday look
I'm gonna go back to the Charlotte
Tilbury legendary lashes which is a
completely different one it's like one
of those huge fluffy ones as I'm not
wearing lipstick I'd quite like to have
some big lashes and that's what this
mascara does for me I'm gonna leave it
there I'm not gonna wear any lipstick I
might put some lip balm actually this
one is quite nice I tried it for the
first time today it's the lana lips
101.1 multi balm and it's in a peach
flavored I love things that are peach
flavored it reminds me of fruits I
always have the peach fruit do I mean
fruit
so what I could
you're getting the tube feel like if
it's yogurt in the tube it should be
Ayub I'm pretty sure it's called a fruit
okay
makeup is done so let me tell you what
I'm doing tonight basically it's kind of
Rich's birthday weekend
this weekend that because his birthday's
on Monday he's gonna be 29 and I just
think that he should have a whole
birthday weekend really so celebrations
start tonight he is on his way back from
Brussels right now because he's been on
a work trip and I'm gonna go meet him at
Kings Cross where the Eurostar gets in
and then we're both going to go together
to the south bank we are gonna go and
visit the recording League cider Lodge
now you guys know I've worked with
record league before it's a cider brand
I absolutely love their drinks so
delicious and it's such a fun brand to
be working with they've set up this
cider lodge on the south bank it
literally it sounds so up my street I'm
so excited I love doing like Christmasy
wintery things like this it's a
Scandinavian inspired Lodge right on the
south bank and they're serving like hot
and cold ciders and I don't really know
actually I need I guess I need to go and
see what it's all about
I've been told that it's like a
Scandinavian style Lodge with like all
Swedish furniture and there's like a
fire pit and a few things going on there
I think there's a photo booth it's
actually open for a really long time so
anyone can go and visit any point it's
open from the 11th of November till the
22nd of January so you can even go after
Christmas and after New Year and well
I'll let you know I'll take you with me
and you can see what it's like for
yourself but it sounds really cool I'm
gonna wrap up get in some cozy clothes
I put on a scarf and hat and coat I'm
gonna go meet rich and then I think it
sounds like it could be a really fun
evening and a really nice way to start
his birthday this is how you stop
yourself getting more ill I've got like
a long sleeve top that's like a polo
neck under another polo neck top this is
the white company I love it and I'm
gonna put on a hat and a scarf and
really wrap up and I'm gonna put on my
boots these are my new boots from June I
absolutely love them I mean they're real
like mum boots my mom literally has
boots like this um I wouldn't say they
are the most like trendiest of things
but they're so warm and the leather so
when it's raining you can wear them I
feel like such a good girl my mum would
be proud I've really wrapped up here the
only thing is I feel like I need a
slightly warmer
but I haven't got one I'm on the lookout
for a warmer coat but I'm wearing my new
jigsaw coat which is lovely and gray

tassels so nice and this hat is from
Urban Outfitters keeping my little head
warm I'm gonna go meet rich at the
Eurostar arrivals Bay I haven't got like
a sign or anything that says rich that

seeing me will be excited enough he's
only been away for 24 hours gosh we're
like newly married couple
actually boy doesn't miss me but I miss
him I hate being home alone I love going
out on a Thursday night I used to go out
on a Thursday night all the time when I
had like a normal job I think Thursday

no the weekends nearly over Tuesday's
the worst day because the week is only
just kind of starting you're not even
halfway there yet Thursday's the best
day cuz like the anticipation of the

I'm gonna put in the rock below that
opening times but this place will give
the kind of different depending there's
a weekday or weekend so if you guys want
to visit it I'll put below all the
details and stuff I really think it's
worth it you're visiting London come and
check out by the lodge
who does have the funny experience on
the tube
I was just saying to rich that I think
it's really funny when people don't
realize that the string on the back of
your coat or jacket like a little
crisscross you're meant to take that off
so that you know your jacket your jacket
we're like kind of flaps it's the same
as that when your pockets are sewn up
you answer take it off and I see people
all the time like walking around
especially guys that walk around their
jackets and there's a little like white
crisscross string and I always think
it's really funny so I study rich and
this guy's tiny news doesn't the tube
just went well I know what I'm gonna be
doing tonight he was like I had no idea
I'm gonna tell all my friends at work
they don't know either
I'm gonna go back and check all my
jackets when I get home and take some
scissors to them it was so funny
I love London when you just randomly
have funny conversations with people
other - but I do see people all the time
with that you definitely meant to cut
that string off pretty funny it's really
hard to walk when you don't cut the
strings the things really tight in your
Baba tree oh that guy really cracked me
up I'm gonna make a cup of tea we're
gonna watch the missing and then go to
bed and I will see you guys tomorrow I'm
gonna vlog again then so I'll see you in
the morning night good morning everyone

little bit sniffy but I feel better like

get quite a bit of work done but um rich
is working from home today which wasn't
expected he's kind of sitting in my
chest area right now my friend Hannah
also had the day off she had boatloads
of holiday days to take before Christmas
so she said I've got a day off can I
come around and say hi because obviously
when you have the day off work not many
of her friends aren't at work but I work
from home so I said come over for a cup
of tea I haven't seen it for a while so
she's coming over and then this is what
happens when you work for yourself
everyone like says can I come for tea or
can you do help me with this I'm
babysitting for like an hour while my
sister goes to the dentist because she
can't take Soren to the dentist with her
so I'm gonna head over and look after
Soren for an hour and he's at that age
where he needs like entertaining so he
can't just sit there while she's having
like stuff done in her mouth I'm gonna
