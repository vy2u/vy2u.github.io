the 12th of February and this is a very
rookie week so I thought I would vlog a
few days wherever I can I don't think
I've ever had such a busy week I'm
literally out of the house every single
day this week but it's all four very
exciting stuff so today tomorrow and
Wednesday so for three days I think I'm
gonna be heading into a studio in Soho
to record my audio book which is really
exciting and I just have no idea what to
expect I really don't know what it's
gonna be like a tool but we discussed
quite early on and every book needs an
audiobook version although I said like I
was like I don't want people to buy the
audiobook I've worked so hard on like
making the book look so special and
there's like a few special things inside
which I want to tell you about so I was
like if people don't buy it they won't
see those things but I know that some
people just don't have time to read a
book and so it's really good to have the
audio version as well so we discussed
early on whether I wanted someone else
to record that or I wants to record it I
think it's more normal for some strange
person who specializes in that to record
it but because the books so personal
about me and you guys obviously know my
voice so well I think it would be weird
to have a random lady reading it so I
said like although I don't particularly
want to do it I feel like I should so
I'm gonna be recording the audiobook
which is just so funny
I think I'm literally gonna be sitting
in a booth on my own for three days
reading over and over and over again I
probably should have bought like throat
sweets with me it's gonna be tiring I
think but it's really good I haven't
read the book in a while so if we really
get to read again just before we start
doing all the press and stuff so that is
what I'm doing I will put a link down
below if you want to buy the audiobook
version but I'll also put a link if you
want to buy the book because obviously I
would love it if you bought the book so
that's what I'm doing till Wednesday and
then on Thursday we're heading to
Suffolk to the printer where they are
going to be printing my book and I'm
gonna be signing copies which are
available and WH Smith online and rich
is coming my mum's coming and I get to
take home a few books that day which is
so exciting because rich hasn't actually
read the book yet I wanted him to read
it like when it is a book and no one
else know
family and my friends at reddit so I'm
gonna grab as many as I can they can
start reading it and I'll be the first
time I actually have the proper book at
my hands so I can't wait
I remember watching like the Zoey go to
the printers when she did her first book
and just been like wow that looks
amazing so I can't wait I'm so excited
and then Friday I've got a shoot with a
brand which is like not book related but
it's gonna be a whole day shoot so busy
busy week very exciting though I can't
wait so I'm gonna head into town and now
I think Lucy my manager said she's gonna
come and settle me in and then leave me
there and yeah like I said they don't
know what to expect but I'm looking
forward to it I thought I'd bring you
guys along to show you how how you
record an audiobook because I have no
idea either it is literally the most
beautiful day ever today I am almost at
studio
Google Maps is taking me quite an
interesting way we're in the studio this
is Sam the producer hello and all the
fancy knobs I don't know what they do
and I'm gonna be in there I think it's
very exciting very profesh
okay done 50 pages already and he was
aiming for a hundred a day then he been
like an hour so I think I'm doing well I
was really worried about Sonny to like
monitor and to be said that it sounds
really good
so cranes I can't tell you like when you
are a book
you're quite nervous as we were to read
it having to literally read it out loud
to someone it's really embarrassing but
yes got such a weird thing to do calm it
looks like you which is that my favorite
place it's got saigon street food it's
really yummy
I'm gonna go stink up the street morning
guys it is Tuesday day two of recording
the audio book I don't know how I feel
about going in today yesterday was like
because it was the first day it was
quite exciting and now I know what to
expect I'm a bit like oh god not
entirely sure I want to sit in a room by
myself all day talking but I'm gonna
psych myself up for it and go in and
hopefully smash it today and finish
everything because it was so good if I
get a free day tomorrow to do filming
and other stuff so that is the plan I'm
gonna try to do it as fast as possible
without actually speaking too fast it's
actually pancake day today I'm home
alone right now but I really really
wanted some pancakes
now don't shout at me I did something
really bad I'm not great at making
pancakes and I knew that I didn't have
much time this morning because I have to
go to the studio I saw these last night
and M&amp;amp;S I know it's cheating I know
they're like pre-made crepes that you
heat up but I really wanted some crepes
they're so good they do these and the
buttermilk ones they had like a whole
little section M&amp;amp;S so I'm just gonna
make myself some crepes with lemon and
sugar yes yes oh my god these smells so
good I can't wait I know they didn't
look that appetizing but they're gonna
be good I'm back in the studio again
I've got big bottle of water because my
mouth gets very dry this is the iPad I
read the book off which makes it very
easy because I can just scroll up cut
tissues for some reason my nose decides
to get really runny when I'm in here and
I have love hearts in case my stomach
starts to rumble because that happened
yesterday and I think I'm already
there are a few sections of the book
where I needed another voice that isn't
mine so kindly Emilia from Glee really
is here thank you how did you find that
when you have to I said you don't
realize how loud you are in there
but now I realize every like sniff and
everything no for me as well Luke is in
the hot seat now it's Charlie cogs I
haven't told you guys this yet but she
wrote a poem especially for this book
it's very exciting so I asked if she can
come in record it yeah exactly
you should just sing it just sing it I
am home I went for a quick bite to eat
with Charlie it was so nice to catch up
with her and I'm so excited for you guys
to read the poem that she wrote for my
book I feel so honored that she wrote a
poem just for the f-word and it's
beautiful I literally said to her I
would love a poem just about female
friendship little spoiler it's actually
about heartbreak female friendship
heartbreak specifically and she said me
about this poem after like a few weeks
of writing it and it was perfect
so I can't wait for you guys to read
that in the book or listen to it on the
audiobook so I've meant to be taking
three days to record the audio book and
I did it in a day and a half I'm so
happy we finished it like two o'clock
today I'm thinking plan B job voiceovers
I don't know anyway I'm gonna carry on
vlogging on Thursday when we go to the
printer and I'm really really excited
for that day so I will speak to you guys
then good morning everyone it is
Thursday and today we're going to the
printers I can't believe it I really
struggled to sleep last night I couldn't
get sleep at all I'm like excited but
quite nervous as well I feel like today
is the beginning of when my book kind of
no longer is mine anymore I was talking
to Charlie Cox about this the other day
and because she's also got a book coming
out we were saying how it's like your
own little thing for so long that you've
got control over and then
minute it comes out it like goes out
into the world and it's no longer yours
anymore and people can like form their
own opinions about it read it in their
own little ways and it's just terrifying
but it's also really exciting and I
think today's gonna be such a nice day I
feel like I'm like a bit detached from
it I can't it doesn't feel like I'm
actually going to see my book get
printed I know that I'm going somewhere
today and that it's important but it
doesn't feel real so I hope when I get
there and I see it it actually feels
real because at the moment it's just
like it's like I'm talking about
something that doesn't there isn't
really real anyway oh my god I'm a mess
outside I'm gonna do my hair and makeup
it's very early in the morning we're
waiting for my mom to get here and then
me which my mom are gonna drive up to
Suffolk it's not where rich is following
Suffolk it's quite North Suffolk and
we're gonna meet briney
okay I'm finally ready which has popped
up to get some coffees and we're gonna
go by the way this jumper that I'm
wearing today is from hush
we got a special little parking area
splat sauce there and this is clays
where the book is getting printed we're
just waiting for the book is just

[Laughter]
this is a but before the cover goes on
look at the inside guys so who I love
so now is the time where I'm gonna sign
loads of copies I've got my Sharpie pens
here I'm gonna put a star on the first
book that I sign and a heart on the last
one so that if you guys if you get one
with a star you know it was the very
first book I signed if you get on with
heart you know it was a very last I
don't know if there's any other like fun
things must be doing pop and I'm just
gonna sign Lily keep it short and sweet
because I think this is gonna take me
they said it should take about two hours
on Amy for an hour and a half the books
coming in I can help
okay I'm gonna sign the first book
parody okay the first one I'm going to
do star
guys I'm on the last book it took me an
hour and a half
knew it I'm so competitive I'm gonna put
a heart on the last one so that if you
get this one you know it was the final
one there you go last one if you look on
the inside of the book this number one
minute here one shows it's the first
print was not refocusing so that's
probably how you can tell I didn't know
that right I am home and Wow today was a
really amazing day I can't tell you how
cool it was see the whole process like I
don't think I really knew that the book
starts like without a cover and then
they kind of make the edges rounded and
then they put the cover on and and then
they kind of round the corners like all
the different steps that go into it is
insane it was such a special day or so
nice to have Richard my mom there as
well and then I signed all of the copies
and they actually sold out today so
there was like a limited amount of
signed copies on WH Smith and they did
sell out so thank you guys so much to
everyone who ordered one of those
obviously the book is still available on
Amazon and when it comes out it'll be in
like Waterstone smith it'll be in loads
of places and I'm sorry if you didn't
get a signed copy but hopefully I'm
going to be doing some events that maybe
you guys can come to and I can sign
yours or if I see you somewhere I can
sign it like I am more than happy to do
that
acaba leave how many people want a
signed copy I think that's just crazy so

like very book focus week I can't
believe I actually have my book like I
