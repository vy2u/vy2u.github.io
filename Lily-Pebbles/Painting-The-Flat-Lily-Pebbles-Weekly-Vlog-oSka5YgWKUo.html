Wednesday and Anna stayed here last
night she's getting ready in this room
not right and we have a day of meetings
today so she stayed over last night we
went to Flair's I'll or eyelash launch
and then today we have loads of meetings
so I thought over vlogs I'm not sure
what other day this week I'm gonna be
out of vlog we're just painting flat all
weekend we are now in town we're like
opto circus area we're gonna walk down
come on up the streets the other side
we're actually going to the Illamasqua
store first to kind of meet them and
chat about new stuff I haven't really
liked try illamasqua or thought about
LMS disappoint well so I'm excited to
see like what new stuff they have out
Anna's stylish be walking around with
her suitcase looking very kind of
important
we're ten minutes early so I'm gonna get
a juice from the detox kitchen and I
love this place
not sure what anything
throwdown Illamasqua now and they did
our makeup and they actually matched me
to the skin based foundation which I
wanted to try for ages so that was good
and we're gonna go sit and have a quick
drink before our next meeting here to
have a drink
oh wait about minutes we've sat here the
entire time like this I've been drinking
my drink she's been drinking her drink
and then we were like for me I'm not go
finish it soon as I now Jamie like went
away likewise it bitter
you've been drinking the wrong drink the
whole time this is amaz lemonade and
that's my eyes this is much better
oh now the gleam office and we've got
really excited because they've got loads
of Oreos and then Anna got really
excited with the maughan box oh my god
it's a lot of mouths she's gonna take as
many as you can home in her suitcase
I'm not even joking I just saw a man
walking backwards on the pavement down
the street I just had to turn on the
camera to tell you guys that because it
was really really bizarre Ana has left
me now we've parted ways it was so nice
to having her stay over it was really
fun that becomes a weekly thing and I'm
now on my way to see my friend Hannah we
are gonna have dinner together and have
a little catch-up I did see her briefly
on the weekend but we've had this in the
diary for a while because we haven't
seen each other properly for ages so I'm
gonna go to her place and we're gonna
chill and get some takeaway and just
chat probably about weddings and life
and stuff so I'm really looking forward
to seeing her I'm at Hannah's flat now
and they're just sitting down to have a
glass of red wine but she has like a
white rug and a very pale grey safer so
I'm slightly paranoid at the moment
she's going to give me a fashion show of
stuff she's bought so I can tell her
whether it looks nice or not how are you
gonna take away this is the first thing
with an O PF of the trousers were a No
are we getting take away quote it
doesn't do much for your height and I
don't look at me cuz I know that we're
gonna do a delivery if you live in
London you don't know what the Libero is
it's amazing I've just introduced a
Hannah to it and if you could use
clothes delivery like basically putting
your postcode and tells you what
restaurants in the area they can pick up
food and deliver in the know like ones
that don't normally have takeaway they
don't know why it says large okay we've
just we've just done this it I feel like
I need to justify the large ass it
actually is large assorted doughnut
fridge magnet which is to his ribs hey
better than larger this is a yummy Thai
takeaway from a restaurant that doesn't
deliver its very excited to me she got
and papaya salad which is like my
favorite so spicy chicken panang curry
mixed vegetables an oyster sauce and a
chicken pad thai
hmm I was about to forget to finish my
vlog but I'm just
I've just cleanse my skin once I'm gonna
see my eyes and then cleanse my skin
again I've been out all day London on
the tube so I'm feeling bit grimy I want
to definitely do like a double cleanse
and I've just been so lazy of my
skincare recently I guess because we've
been like kind of moving and I've been
really busy I've just got really lazy so
I'm gonna try and do like a full
skincare routine tonight
and then get back into things from
tomorrow so when am I going to vlog yeah
probably on the weekend we are planning
on painting the flat this weekend
hopefully so yeah I'll check back with
you guys then right
I have Sunday Day on Saturday for good
reason I've let my hair get greasy I'm
wearing a really really old teacher that
has stains in it because today we are
gonna start painting the flat and I
really hope you can get it all done in
one day I know that's a bit adventurous
but it's a very small flat and I think
we've got some friends helping and we're
just painting white on a very pale pink
annoyingly the guy that did up the flat
painted it pink I don't know why you
would do that so really lit she's a
painting at white hopefully we won't
need too many coats and I'm gonna bring
you guys along it's not very interesting
but I thought you might want to see us
painting the flat and that's all I'm
really doing this weekend the kids
stayed over last night so I'm gonna go
see what they're doing downstairs what
are you two watching Chicken Little
what is that like Stuart Little
we're just quickly gonna pop into MLS
because we want to get some food and
drink for anyone who's coming to help
all right we had lots of friends help
him but a few of them have dropped out I
don't blame them it's gonna be like the
hottest day of the year today but I
think Rich's best friend Nev Oh his
name's actually Alex but we call him Nev
oh but you guys may remember him from
like an old vlog when they weren't so
vain he's hilarious
he's coming down for the weekends he's
gonna help us and I think maybe Lucy
might be coming as well it should be
nice so we're gonna go get some snacks
and drinks I'm so upset apparently
they're candy floss grapes but his dog
to me but I can't find them in any of my
M&amp;amp;S is like these all
I've got sandwiches drinks ice lollies
this by the way is my favorite drink
from M&amp;amp;S a cool white great botanicals
mint next with a dandelion it's so nice
okay we're gonna start by painting in
the bedroom we have a giant bed in the
middle of the room you heart it looks
white but I promise in real life it's
actually just a light pink and we're
gonna start by doing this room before
everyone else turns up this is quite a
small room I can touch the ceiling so
let's do this it has but this kind of
complicated bit here which it's gonna be
that easy to do we're gonna try our best
I've only just started and I already
have paint all over my hands and arms
and that will that will and now we're on
to this wall I'm just having a little
rest here it like faint it's very hot
today my hands are absolutely covered in
paint on the face I think carrot and her
miss break rich is doing the tricky
bells there while I start in this room
I'm just doing the edges ceilings in
this room much higher so I'm not then we
have to each piece of that like that hey
we have one more person who's joined the
painting painting party that was just me
enriched for quantum phone neither's
here I've already explained that that's
not really your name but we are doing
quite well this room so we're going to
get back to the bedroom disassemble
close this room the kind of boys run out
to get more paint and dust sheets and
left me by myself in the flat the
music's gone
I'm literally covered in paint obviously
I have a really good shower tonight
I think Lucy's on her way now would that
be fun very tired it's very tiring on
your arms is hope hate anything we
haven't even done this like big room yet
and we need to do a second coat in the
bedroom and the office and then do the
hallway oh we've done the second coat of
the bedroom now Nivas just touching up
this bit here Lucy's joined us now hello
now you can see that this was pink
better that which is white we stopped
for a sandwich I thought Shane Rich's
arm hair he's going gray in his old age
oh my god imagine if that's actually
what happened when you gold Oh actually
her you know oh my god you know like a
muppet he's actually Harriet okay next
we're gonna do the hallway
I slowly break here's nice last free and
flat free
vlogs and ages but don't the villains
ever hear Ben and Gemma came to help out
Lucy left and we have done we got a nice
suit in a whole day and just well Nevis
has mopped up the floor thank you and
it's all looking very nice and white
I keep seeing pink but I think that's
just because my eyes used to it in the
camera it definitely looks white I say
that we're done I'm gonna go home and
shower
I can't wait for a shower wash my hair
I'm gonna take away these watch my feet
they definitely still have glass in them
and that's that we're all home and
exhausted and having Thai food I've
nearly finished mine yummy mmm-hmm we're

this paint off our body and I'm gonna
