going there for the weekend in case you
missed my last video I went there with
my boyfriend for the weekend for our
5-year anniversary it was so nice we
literally ate so much amazing food went
to amazing restaurants did all the
touristy stuff and just had a really
nice weekend I think I've got a blogpost
coming up this week and maybe even today
on it so I'll link that below if it's
gone up already I wasn't planning on
doing a haul video I didn't think I'd
get that much stuff because most of
stuff like you can get here I went into
Sephora and only got a couple of things
because like I said most of things are
the same and I have a rule when I go on
holiday that I only buy stuff that I
can't get at home or if it's a lot
cheaper because otherwise I just spend
those money just because I'm in holiday
mode so most things in Sephora were the
same so I didn't really get much in
there but I went to city farmer which is
the pharmacy that Lisa Eldridge
recommended in Paris and I've been to a
lot of French pharmacies in my lifetime
but this is like a whole nother level of
French pharmacy it has every brand that
quarterly nooks lush posed a by derm all
of them but it has like every product
they do
it's massive it was like heaving with
people all the boyfriends and husbands
are waiting outside and it was crazy
busy but I just grabbed a basket and I
went a bit nuts I'm not sure why but I
just want loads of things that I wanted
to try so I've got quite a lot of things
so I'm going to quickly show you now
what I got so this is like my Sephora
bag and I just got a couple of things
from makeup forever because that's quite
hard to find in the UK and it's brand I
really like so the first thing I got was
one of their aqua eyes eyeliner and this
is in number one L I have a brown liner
from there it's my favorite brown
eyeliner that I own it applies so nice
and smoothly lasts all day and I wanted
a darker Brown but they didn't have one
so I ended up getting this one so the
numbers 1l and it's kind of like a slate
gray kind of color I feel like it has a
bit of gold shimmer in it no I think if
it that he's just a dark grey but it's
really nice it looks really nice at used
as a liner on the top so I've got one of
those
and then I also thought I'd try one of
their aqua lips which has their
waterproof lip liners and I got this in
14c and this is pretty much like my lips
but better color it's just kind of a
rosy and it's really nice to use as a
liner or just all over the lip and it
lasts really well because it's
waterproof so that's all I got from
Sephora it was a massive Sephora it was
really nice but everything was just the
same at home they didn't have like fresh
or any other things that the Americans
for us have which is a bit of shame so
then I went to since a farmer my such a
farmer bag had to lug it around all day
full of stuff and first things like Oh
obviously Bioderma deal actually for my
mom and sister because I've got quite a
few bottles left over from when my mom
went to France last time so I just got
this for them this came in like a pack
of two but then I also saw that they did
the medium-sized I've got one of the
many by divers and I've got the big ones
but this is like the medium one this is
250 ml and so I got a couple of these
because I thought these are really good
for traveling the small ones are a bit
too small but this would be really good
I'm going to over two weeks in January
so this would be perfect for that so I
just got a couple of those because I
like the size hopefully I can work out
how to take the lid off so I can refill
them and then I got a couple more things
in Bioderma as well cuz like I said they
had all the products out it could have
gone crazy but I tried to restrain
myself I got a hand cream because I love
hand creams and I'm think I just
finished my kills one or maybe it's like
one more go in there this is just the
repair hand cream of dry and damaged
hands and it's not heavily scented but
it's really nice I've used it once
it seems really nice so I'll just put
that on my bag and use it up but yeah
that was nice about that at the council
when I was paying and I also got a bit
randomly Bioderma do trim so I like to I
need gauges because I used to have like
an allergy to a lot I'm a think I'm a
right now but it's nice so I find new
ones and this look quite cute so I just
picked that up perform at La Roche Posay
I've got one of their BB creams I just
saw this and thought it'd look quite
I don't know if they do it here but I
don't think I've seen it and it came in
light medium and dark so I got the light
um it says it's a hydrating uterus just
what kind of caught my attention becomes
a nice little tube I have opened it I
haven't tried it yet I opened it there
and looked at it and it doesn't look
very pale and quite pinky tone so I'm
not sure if this is gonna work for my
skin tone but I try to be on my hand and
it's very sheer so it could be like an
under foundation kind of thing yes is
unifying moisturizing care sensitive
skin so these want to come tinted
moisturizer
not really I'm looking forward to trying
that I haven't tried any of these yet
really so this is more just showing you
what I got rather than what I think of
them I got a couple of masks I love face
masks so I went search I got what I
asked the lady what the best ones she
recommends are and she really liked
these two the first one is nukes mask
and this is the refreshing and relaxing
cream mask moisturizes suits with water
flowers and baobab extract face and eye
contour this comes in a little tube like
this this is a very kind of like a cream
hydrating one I put it on my hand it's
not sick at all feels a bit like a
moisturizer rather than like thick mask
that you have to wash off so looking
forward to trying that this was lady in
the shop this is her all-time favorite
mask which is good recommendation and
the next one is a venn and this is
another hydrating mask hydrating product
and really good for my kind of skin just
sort of dry and dehydrated skin so yeah
this one again comes in a little tube
and it says soothing moisture mask so
moisture hydrating all these words
definitely what I look for in products
and say yeah I need to find time to try
both of those masks but I'm gonna come
forward to it and I'm I'm sure some of
these products will end up on my blog
which is why I heart stay calm so if you
want to see what I think of them then go
and follow me on there and then the last
few things I got from the brand new Iraq
deaf I'm saying that right the first
thing is an eye cream and this is the D
up to calm soothing balm and mask I
could
or helps calm and decongest eyelids but
some of the translations but off but she
said this is really good for hydrating
under the eye and for dark circles it
just comes in this little tube like this
I tried this once when I was still in
Paris and it felt really nice and I
haven't really got like an eye cream
that I love and so I'm looking forward
to trying that I also really wanted to
get a toner that it's like a last minute
thing one else in the I remember but I
don't really use a toner and I've always
told to use toner so I asked her what
which one should recommend it and she
showed me to this one that was like 70
euros I was like I can't spend that much
but then they had a smaller size and
this is the lyric Tonique effect it says
it's basically a vitamin enriched -
toner for face and eyes complete makeup
removal toned skin radiant complexion so
you can use this as a makeup remover as
well but I'll be using this on cotton
wool just after I cleanse to get rid of
any excess makeup or just the tone the
skin really and I like the packaging it
came in like a few different colors I
think for different skin types but this
is for my skin type so yeah looking
forward to trying that this isn't it's
really good and then the last thing is
this little duo set that I saw it says
it's one Grazia Beauty award um so
that's always good and it basically is
like two products from lyric in there
and it's the creme exfoliating cream
scrub and silky moisture gel cream
hydration multi protection so just a
couple one for us to try I really want
to try the brand I've never tried it
before so I thought this is a good way
try a couple of their sort of
best-selling products so I like that
little set and then that's everything I
got
so it was quite a lot I spent a little
money but it's all kind of stuff I
haven't tried new stuff puff the
Bioderma
so I'm looking for China or and I hope
you like seeing why I bought so don't
forget to check out my blog I think
today the post is going to be going up
with all the photos from my trip and
thank you for watching and I'll see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
