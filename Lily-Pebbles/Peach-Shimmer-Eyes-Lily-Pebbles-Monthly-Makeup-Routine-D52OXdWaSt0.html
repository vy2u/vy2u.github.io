today i'm going to be doing another
monthly makeup routine this is for july
and i'm gonna do the look that I was
wearing and I think it was a whole video
it's not exactly the same but it's the
eyes and the main focus and a lot of you
guys requested a tutorial it's for the
peachy glittery eyes that were inspired
by tarty from glam life guru my youtube
name i'm gonna link her youtube down
below she is great but she talked about
these I products and I fell in love I
hunted them down and I'm so so happy I
got them because it's really different
to anything that I've worn before but
I've kept the skin and lips very similar
to my usual look so I just thought I'd
show you how I do this look and I really
hope you guys like it I've been obsessed
with like bronzy skin especially since i
got back for my quick trip to France I
got a little bit of a time I try not to
sit in the Sun too much but then I've
just been like adding on to that with
fake tan at home and with makeup so the
first step in this routine is the
clarins liquid bronze self tanning and
this is for the face yes for the face
and deckle it are those dick a large
décolletage I don't know what this area
is called like collarbone area I just
used up my face and it says to put on
top of your day cream in the morning so
I just used some custom well sometimes
they're due in the evening and it just
takes the edge off if you have quite
pale light skin which is also gorgeous
you can't obviously just leave it like
that but in the summer I like to be a
little bit more tan so I just put this
on with custom wall and it makes all the
difference and then I'm going to use the
Smashbox photo finish primer water and
I'm just going to spray that on to my
face now I was very wet I don't know how
I feel about this yet I don't really
think it does anything but I have quite
a few of these different makeup sprays
and although it doesn't do that much I
like to have slightly damp skin before I
do my makeup I've got dry skin so all
the makeup looks that I tend to do a
very jewy and shiny and hydrating
because I love that look that's
basically why I'm trying to achieve in
the summer I'm then going to go on to do
my skin and I'm going to use the estee
lauder CC cream mixed in with Nas sugar
I've been using this every day for about
two months now the estee lauder CC cream
is great because it really bronzes up
the skin like for my shade skin it's
slightly darker so I like to mix in with
a bit of foundation which has some
coverage and the sheer glow is
particularly glowy and they work really
well together so I'm going to put like a
pea sized a mountain on the back of my
hand and then take pea sized amount of
NARS sheer glow and then using my finger
and kind of mixing them together I'm
just going to apply it onto my skin
and then blend it in using my Bobby
Brown full coverage face brush
the
the CC cream just completely changes the
texture of the foundation and I
absolutely love it okay now sadly i
finished my charlotte tilbury we touch a
concealer it's one of those wind up ones
so the other day when I was using it
just finished a mime bit distraught or
really into get another one so I haven't
really got any sort of concealer that
I'm loving at the moment I'm going to
use a mix of two there Clarence instant
concealer because it's a little bit
lighter under my eyes and then the urban
decay naked skin in light neutral which
I love but can't find the right shade
for me it's very frustrating so I'm just
going to take a tiny bit of the Clarins
because it's very liquidy and just tap
that under my eyes because it's so wet I
like to apply it and then wait a few
seconds for it to kind of dry out and
then I find it easier to blend in I'm
just going to wait a few seconds and
then I'm going to use my real techniques
setting brush and just very lightly Pat
it in and I think this gives the best
coverage
take whatever is left on the brush onto
my lids so I've quite dark outlets and
then using the Urban Decay concealer I'm
just going to put little bit on my chin
a little bit around my nose it's a bit
on my nose and then it's fine if lit
more just under this part of my eye I've
got a few spots but I'm just going to
leave them I like in the summer I don't
want to kind of pile on the concealer
too much
okay i'm going to do my brows now i
normally do Bruns at first because i use
a big brush but today i'm not using a
powder bronzer so i can do my brows now
and i'm using that Anastasia brow Wiz as
usual but I got a new shade this is
medium brown before i was using soft
brown and i think miss say I think this
shade is much better suited I think it's
slightly less warm I'm just gonna set
them in place with the a nostalgic clear
brow gel the only one that doesn't make
my eyebrows white and crispy okay I feel
like that's all the boring stuff out the
way so now I can get on to the fun stuff
and I already spoke about this product
in my new Beauty launches video which I
will link below if you haven't seen it I
basically took through lots of new
Beauty launches and what I think of them
as i said i am obsessed with this
product at the moment it is from YSL
it's the less sahari n some kiss blur
effect sir I really didn't like the
primer version of this I didn't really
get the point but this is like a cream
bronzer and it's amazing so I will show
you how I apply it this is what is
giving me a sun-kissed proper I feel
like when you use powder bronzer in
summer just looks so Matt and powdery
and false and waiting loads of makeup
this just really blends into a skin and
looks like such a natural tan if you
apply it right the idea is that you
apply it where you would normally get a
tan and you don't get tan in the
contours of your cheeks you don't get a
tan you know under your eyes on your
chin you get it on the high points of
your face because that's where the Sun
hits so along the top of your cheekbones
so I'm just using my Real Techniques
contour brush and very lightly so I
don't disrupt all the foundation and
stuff I'm just running it along the tops
of my cheekbones and it's this one it's
slightly ready um like a red Turner
button so it really looks like a natural
time I absolutely love this and
definitely taking it to LA with me
take it along the top of my forehead
along my hairline it's just the formula
is so smooth and soft and lovely so nice
to apply and it really just blends into
your skin's it doesn't look like you're
wearing makeup it looks so natural hope
that's being picked up on camera because
it's so so gorgeous I love it Oh sir Sir
this product and I'm gonna do blusher at
the end because i'm doing like a peachy
I I want to wait and see what sort of
color I need on my cheeks because
probably not that much but I'm going to
use a little bit of powder now I know I
said I don't like to use powder but the
hourglass ambient lighting powders are
very reflective and glowy and very
pretty I try not to wear these too much
during the day but I feel like this is
more of a summer evening look because of
the glitter on the eye so I'm just going
to take the one on the far right of the
palette which is slightly bronzy
actually i might mix it with the one in
the middle as well and just take that
the tops of my cheekbones kind of end up
taking it all over okay so now for the
eyes and the first thing I'm going to do
is take a light brown matte eyeshadow
and you can get this in most palettes
the naked one has a really good i think
it's the lighter of the two Browns that
was really good for this I'm gonna use
my Vizier palette because this is all
matte so I know there will be a shade in
here that will be perfect taking quite a
long brush for this I feel like when you
do the crease it's nice to have a bit of
movement if it's too short and kind of
tough then you'll apply too much product
so pick a brush which is quite like long
and bendy and I'm going to take this
light brown shade I'm not showing you
very well here I'm going to take off in
the back of my hand because always
better to apply less and add to it and
then the crease of your eye is well
where it creases and where the bone goes
in so I'm just going to apply it along
there
I'm going to add this later so I'm just
using it as a kind of guideline very
lightly and then I'm going to apply this
kind of almost skin tone color it's
slightly pale peach but it's just more
record all over the lid color really i'm
going to apply that all over ok now I've
done that I'm going to go back to the
crease shade and just add to that little
bit more
quality of these eyeshadows are amazing
the palette is really expensive but if
you use matte eyeshadows a lot then I do
think it's worth it especially if you
like warm tones I'm now going to do the
underneath of the eye using the same
light matte brown shade I'm not going to
apply too much what I want to keep this
look quite light okay so that's kind of
like the guideline of the eye and now is
the fun bit i'm going to use two
products which i absolutely love the
first one is from urban decay and this
is their eye shadow called free love and
its a bright golden peach I think that's
how I would describe it's like a peach
of golden shimmers running through it
it's quite orange though like orangie
peach so I don't want to apply it all
over the lid more just kind of to the
center and then on top of that i'm going
to press on a bit of the NARS
Christopher cane outer limits eyeshadow
which is just the most beautiful glitter
it's like peach with pink glitter so on
me I can't believe that I like it but I
really do we're very lightly Pat the
brush because urban scale shadows are so
pigmented this is such a pretty shade
because well anything with gold shimmer
in it I love it really catches the light
a bit like by terry misty rock it kind
of catches the light and makes you I
list of little bit wet and now I'm going
to take the glitter and I'm just gonna
use my middle finger the reason I'm
using my fingers because this shadow
does have quite a lot of fall down it's
quite nice to have a bit of glitter in
your cheekbones but I feel like if you
use a brush it will go everywhere so I'm
just pressing my finger in I like to put
just a little bit when i did my sister's
makeup she was like put on more glitter
she loves it I like just a little bit so
you can just see and putting it mainly
in the middle of the lid in the center
of the lid it's so pretty so that's with
the glitter applied when I was wearing
this makeup last time I had black liquid
eyeliner which I think looks absolutely
gorgeous especially for a night out but
I'm gonna film some more videos after
this and I wanted to be a bit more of a
summary looks so I'm gonna leave it with
no eyeliner and instead I'm just gonna
put on a lot of mascara I'm going to use
my eyelash curlers first these ones are
from Schumer
and then I'm back to my favorite ever
mascara I ran out but I got another one
is the connect high impact extreme
volume mascara when I want my mascara to
be waterproof though like when I was in
France I would apply this and then apply
a waterproof one on top while it's still
wet and that kind of locked it all in
place I'm just gonna lay this on really
I find when you do really long strokes
that works the best for my lashes I mean
look at that that is an amazing mascara
and I'm also going to apply a little bit
of the clinic bottom lash mascara but
like this really opens up your eyes now
I'm going to add a tiny bit of blusher I
don't think I need much because I like
that kind of glowy skin with a bit of
bronze on it I'm just going to add a
tiny bit
a little bit of color
oh this is by the way the tart a shi'ite
oh I never know how to pronounce this
one ACH I OTE I go to finish off the
look I'm not going to put on anything
like crazy on the lips I want to keep it
quite neutral and pretty I think it's
all going on in the eyes so I'm going to
use my by Terry bombed arose I actually
went and picked up shade one after
Victoria showed me that she uses it all
the time and really likes it as like a
pink lip gloss and I really liked it as
you can see I've used quite a lot
already it's just a really pretty pink
and there you go ok so that's the
finished makeup look I really hope you
like it it's just a pretty kind of
different peachy glittery summer look I
really like it and I'm excited now to
film a couple of videos where in this
makeup thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you guys in my next video
