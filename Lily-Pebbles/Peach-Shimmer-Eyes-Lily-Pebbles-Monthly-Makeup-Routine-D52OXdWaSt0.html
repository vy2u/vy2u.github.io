today I'm gonna be doing another monthly
makeup routine this is for July and I'm
gonna do the look that I was wearing and
I think it was a haul video it's not
exactly the same but it's the eyes that
and the main focus and a lot of you guys
requested a tutorial it's for the peachy
glittery eyes that were inspired by
tarty from glam Life guru my youtube
name I'm gonna link her youtube down
below she is great but she talks about
these eye products and I fell in love I
hunted them down and I'm so so happy I
got them because it's really different
to anything that I've worn before but
I've kept the skin and lips very similar
to my usual look so I just thought I'd
show you how I do this look and I really
hope you guys like it I've been obsessed
with like bronzy skin especially since I
got back for my quick trip to France I
got a little bit of a time I try not to
sit in the Sun too much but then I've
just been like adding on to that with
fake tan at home and with makeup so the
first step in this routine is the
Clarins liquid bronze self-tanning and
this is for the face yes for the face
and deckle it thick a large decolletage
I don't know what this area is called
but like collarbone area I just use it
on my face and it says to put on top of
your day cream in the morning so I just
used some custom well sometimes they're
doing the evening and it just takes the
edge off if you have quite pale light
skin which is also gorgeous you can't
obviously just leave it like that
but in the summer I like to be a little
bit more tan so I just put this on with
a custom wall and it makes all the
difference and then I'm going to use the
Smashbox photo finish primer water and
I'm just gonna spray that onto my face
now I was very wet I don't know how I
feel about this yet I don't really think
it does anything but I have quite a few
of these different makeup sprays and
although it doesn't do that much I like
to have slightly damp skin before I do
my makeup
I've got dry skin so all the makeup
looks that I tend to do a very gooey and
shiny and hydrating because I love that
look that's basically why I'm trying to
achieve in the summer I'm then gonna go
on to do my skin and I'm gonna use the
Estee Lauder CC cream mixed in with NARS
sheer glow I've been using this everyday
for about two months now the Estee
Lauder CC cream is great because it
really bronze is up the skin like for my
shade skin it's slightly darker so I
like to mix in with a bit of foundation
which has some good coverage
and the shade glow is particularly glowy
and they worked really well together so
I'm going to put like a pea-sized a
mountain on the back of my hand and then
take a pea-sized amount of NARS sheer
glow and then using my finger and kind
of mixing them together I'm just going
to apply it onto my skin
and then blend it in using my Bobbi
Brown full coverage face brush
the CC cream just completely changes the
texture of the foundation and I
absolutely love it
okay now sadly I finished my Charlotte
Tilbury retouch a concealer it's one of
those wind-up ones so the other day when
I was using it it just finished and I'm
bit distraught I really need to get
another one so I haven't really got any
sort of concealer that I'm loving at the
moment I'm gonna use a mix of two there
Clarins instant concealer because it's a
little bit lighter under my eyes and
then a bit decay naked skin in light
neutral which I love but can't find the
right shade for me it's very frustrating
so I'm just gonna take a tiny bit of the
Clarins because it's very liquidy and
just tap that under my eyes because it's
so wet I like to apply it and then wait
a few seconds for it to kind of dry out
and then I find it easier to blend in
I'm just gonna wait a few seconds and
then I'm going to use my Real Techniques
setting brush and just very lightly Pat
it in and I think this gives the best
coverage
take whatever's left on the brush onto
my lids because I've quite dark
it--let's and then using the urban decay
concealer I'm just gonna put a little
bit on my chin a little bit around my
nose it's a bit on my nose and then it's
fine little bit more just under this
part of my eye I've got a few spots but
I'm just going to leave them I like in
the summer I don't want to kind of pile
on the concealer too much
okay I'm gonna do my brows now I
normally do Bruns at first because I use
a big brush but today I'm not using a
powder bronzer so I can do my brows now
and I'm using that Anastasia brow Wiz as
usual but I got a new shade this is
medium brown before I was using soft
Brown and I think mistake I think this
shade is much better suited I think it's
slightly less warm I'm just gonna set
them in place with the Anastasia clear
brow gel the only one that doesn't make
my eyebrows white and crispy okay I feel
like that's all the boring stuff out the
way so now I can get on to the fun stuff
and I already spoke about this product
in my new Beauty launches video which I
will link below if you haven't seen it I
basically talk through lots of new
Beauty launches and what I think of them
as I said I am obsessed with this
product at the moment it is from YSL
it's the les Sahar en some kiss blur
effect so I really didn't like the
primer version of this I didn't really
get the point but this is like a cream
bronzer and it's amazing so I will show
you how I apply it this is what is
giving me a sunkissed proper I feel like
when you use powder bronzer in the
summer just looks so matte and powdery
and false and look at you own loads of
makeup but this just really blends into
a skin and looks like such a natural tan
if you apply it right the idea is that
you apply it where you would normally
get a tan and you don't get its hand in
the contours of your cheeks you don't
get a tan you know under your eyes and
on your chin you get it on the high
points of your face because that's where
the Sun hits so along the top of your
cheekbones so I'm just using my Real
Techniques contour brush and very
lightly so I don't disrupt all the
foundation and stuff I'm just running it
along the tops of my cheekbones and it's
this one it's slightly ready it's like a
red tone bronze so it really looks like
a natural tan I absolutely love this and
definitely taking it to LA with me
take it along the top of my forehead
along my hairline it's just the formula
is so smooth and soft and lovely so nice
to apply and it really just blends into
your skins it doesn't look like you're
wearing makeup it looks so natural
that's being picked up on camera because
it's so so gorgeous I love it with this
product and I'm gonna do blusher at the
end because I'm doing like a peachy eye
I want to wait and see what sort of
color I need on my cheeks cuz it's
probably not that much but I'm gonna use
a little bit of powder now I know I said
I don't like to use powder but the
hourglass ambient lighting powders are
very reflective and glowy and very
pretty I try not to wear these too much
during the day but I feel like this is
more of a summer evening look because of
the glitter on the eye so I'm just gonna
take the one on the far right of the
palette which is slightly bronzy
actually I might mix it with the one in
the middle as well and just take that
the tops of my cheekbones
I kind of end up taking it all over okay
so now for the eyes and the first thing
I'm gonna do is take a light brown matte
eyeshadow and you can get this in most
pallets The Naked one has a really good
I think it's the lighter of the two
Browns that was really good for this
I'm gonna use my busy art palette
because this is all matte so I know
there will be a shade in here that will
be perfect I'm taking quite a long brush
for this cuz I feel like when you do the
crease it's nice to have a bit of
movement if it's too short and kind of
tough then you'll apply too much product
so pick a brush which is quite like long
and bendy and I'm gonna take this light
brown shade I'm not showing you very
well here and I'm gonna take off in the
back of my hand because always better to
apply less and add to it and then the
crease of your eye is well where it
creases and where the bone goes in so
I'm just gonna apply it along there I'm
gonna add this later so I'm just using
it as a kind of guideline very lightly
and then I'm gonna apply this kind of
almost skintone color it's slightly pale
peach but it's just more record all over
the lid color really I'm gonna apply
that all over
okay now I've done that I'm going to go
back to the crease shade and just add to
that a little bit more
quality of these eyeshadows are amazing
the palette is really expensive but if
you use matte eyeshadows a lot then I do
think it's worth it especially if you
like warm tones I'm now gonna do the
underneath of the eye using the same
light matte brown shade I'm not gonna
apply too much but I want to keep this
look quite light okay so that's kind of
like the guideline of the eye and now is
the fun bit I'm gonna use two products
which I absolutely love the first one is
from urban decay and this is their eye
shadow called free love and it's a
bright golden peach I think that's how I
would describe it's like a peach of gold
and shimmers running through it it's
quite orange though like orange II peach
so I don't want to apply it all over the
lid more just kind of to the center and
then on top of that I'm gonna press on a
bit of the NARS Christopher Kane Outer
Limits eyeshadow which is just the most
beautiful glitter
it's like peach with pink glitter it's
so on me I can't believe that I like it
but I really do
we're very lightly Pat the brush because
urban scale shadows are so pigmented
this is such a pretty shade because well
anything with gold shimmer in it I love
it really catches the light a bit like
by Terry misty rock it kind of catches
the light and makes your eye list a
little bit wet and now I'm gonna take
the glitter and I'm just gonna use my
middle finger the reason I'm using my
fingers because this shadow does have
quite a lot of fall down it's quite nice
to have a bit of glitter in your
cheekbones but I feel like if you use a
brush it will go everywhere so I'm just
pressing my finger in I like to put just
a little bit when I did my sister's
makeup she was like put on more glitter
she loves it I like just a little bit so
you can just see and putting it mainly
in the middle of the lid in the centre
of the lid it is so pretty so that's
with the glitter applied when I was
wearing this makeup last time I had
black liquid eyeliner which I think
looks absolutely gorgeous especially for
a nice help but I'm gonna film some more
videos after this and I wanted to be a
bit more of a summery look so I'm gonna
leave it with no eyeliner and instead
I'm just gonna put on a lot of mascara
I'm gonna use my eyelash curlers first
these ones are from Shu Uemura
and then I'm back to my favorite ever
mascara I ran out but I got another one
is the Connect high impact extreme
Volume Mascara when I want my mascara to
be waterproof though like when I was in
France I would apply this and then apply
a waterproof one on top while it's still
wet and that could have locked it all in
place I'm just gonna lay this on really
I find when you do really long strokes
that works the best for my lashes I mean
look at that that is an amazing mascara
and I'm also going to apply a little bit
of the Clinique bottom lash mascara but
like this really opens up your eyes now
I'm gonna add a tiny bit of blusher I
don't think I need much because I like
that kind of glowy skin with a bit of
bronze on it I'm just gonna add a tiny
bit
a little bit of color
oh this is by the way the tart ash
shi'ite I never know how to pronounce
this one ACH io te
okay to finish off the look I'm not
gonna put on anything like crazy on the
lips I want to keep it quite neutral and
pretty I think it's all going on in the
eyes so I'm gonna use my by Terry Baume
De Rose I actually went and picked up
shade one after Victoria showed me that
she uses it all the time and really
likes it as like a pink lip gloss and I
really like it as you can see I've used
quite a lot already it's just a really
pretty pink and there you go okay so
that's the finished makeup look I really
hope you like it it's just a pretty kind
of different peachy glittery summer look
I really like it and I'm excited now to
film a couple of videos wearing this
makeup thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you guys in my next video
