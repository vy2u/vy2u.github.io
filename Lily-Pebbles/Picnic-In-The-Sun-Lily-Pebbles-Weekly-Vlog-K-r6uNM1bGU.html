know what day it is I think it's
Wednesday and we're going to have to
check wait it's Wednesday today and I'm
running a little bit behind schedule I
meant to be filming a video this morning
my monthly makeup tutorial that's going
up on Sunday but there's a giant wasp
right there on the window like Giants
duper dwarfs and I've got the window
wide open so it can fly out and be free
but it just keeps missing it so I'm
missing it about 15 minutes watching
this was desperately hoping for it to
get out so I can close the window and
start filming I'm gonna film me my blue
eyeliner tutorial from my makeup
collection video because you guys all
requested it and I like that makeup look
at the moment and it's really sunny at
the moment today and yesterday has been
amazing weather in London so it'd be
nice to have some kind of summery makeup
and it's also my best friend Keisha's
birthday today so I am seeing her later
and tonight which should be really nice
I just need to get this video done and
this bloody was
here's all the makeup I'm using for
today's video and my lights and camera
all set up so I'm ready to go let's hope
there's no noise to disturb me because
if makeup stores it's quite hard to keep
stopping and starting and it's quite
hard to edit out noise so things crossed
I'm just gonna see what happens okay
it's much later in the afternoon I've
filmed edited done some work and it
turns out Keisha's mom has organized
like a picnic for her in Kenwood wears
like grass and stuff and it's so sunny
so I'm gonna go and like crash that
because I just can't sit inside and work
when it's too sunny
I know hardly ever get sick you ship
she's always in some other country so
I'm gonna go out now I just literally
put on this like grey slouchy top and
these brown suede shorts which I will be
showing in a haul video soon and look
where scruffy but it's just so hot I
wonder where shorts my legs definitely
not prepared for this but I'm gonna put
on some boots to kind of balance out a
bit so I'm gonna get ready and ahead to
Kenwood now run spraying to say it's
proper proper boiling outside so I just
changed to her white t-shirt in case the
other one's a little bit hot inspecting
this weather is amazing and probably
very of my leg belt
this is really bizarre
I have a blanket with me just in case is
not enough room I'm gonna go find the
others now
- J as she thinks she looks bad but
thinking it really cool your flowers and
I only showed me up I just have a bit
more chances like oh that's what real
friends owe us that you're 28
beautiful she is
it's not modeling at birthdays a win for
the Frappuccino so cool we're gonna go
kick me spell though I didn't bring
anything popular blanket
day
had a lovely picnic in the Sun I don't
want to leave the Sun we want to go get
ready for the screening you're going to
later and quiche hasn't seen pitch
perfect one and neither is Esther day so
it's gonna just picture perfect with
perfume that way this is what the
singing one where they do the cup song
yeah let's go home and watch the first
one now or watch clips on YouTube are
going through are you
yeah I came back home that was such a
nice little picnic the weather was just
amazing and always W to catch up with
friends and I'm actually seeing teacher
nestor again because we're all going to
go to the screening tonight anna is also
going and i think the twins Lucy Lydia
gonna be there to be nice we're going to
see pitch perfect 2 SJ quiche I haven't
seen the first one which is really silly
but I have a method of a spawn film so
we're going to go to that and then go up
dinner teacher's birthday so I just
rushed home to do my makeup a bit there
and change my outfit I've made such a
mess on my bedroom but so I did I'm
gonna try out the little kind of is it
cool to cold when you'd like matching
top and bottoms in a try I haven't worn
it yet it's a bit kind of out there it's
not like a premiere with the red carpet
or it is the screaming but it's a nice
sunny evening so long-sleeve bare legs I
think it'll work
I have no idea what shoes to wear with
it though and so I'm just gonna finish
getting ready and then I think we're
gonna do station mean Keisha timed it
perfectly so that we got the stage
quality so that our way
okay we gotta go fine - Dave I think
whilst awaiting that might do like an
outfit of the day with me and you and
then I'm going to show you what Keisha's
wearing first
okay well it's the top from oh it's nice
back let me see that's really nice it's
from Zara H&amp;amp;M Pelle yes ROG and some
boots yes
denial an attack and some feathers
London Rick we go it's nice in the game
I mean
- no people which I'll show you video in
America I confess that it want to be too
small and rebar
the guy that's singing over there
actually has a really nice voice it
sounds good I Jack Johnson
spontaneously to have a semester
they love sunny evenings in London he's
got a mini burger yeah okay we're going
inside it found us and we're worried
there wouldn't be any seats guys that I
think there's enough seats or sit
together in the car
because here now in away
which is in the future that's what we've
got I'm home now and I've just been
catching up on Hollyoaks because I
always feel like he need to watch a
little bit of something before I go to
bed and I face times rich because he's
in Vienna for work so that was nice I
had a really fun day and evening with my
friends and now I'm ready to have my cup
of tea
get in bed watch some YouTube videos and
do some work tomorrow and I think mean
he should my actually film together
while she's here we organize a little
video so I think on Friday she's gonna
come over to film and I probably vlog
again on the weekend I'm not really sure
but I will see you guys again and that's
for today right good morning guys today
is Sunday which I should really just
start cooling greasy hair day because
every time I'm not gonna Sunday I
complain about my hair but I don't care
it's Sunday anyway and I've put on a
bright lip to kind of counteract the
greasy hair thing which is what I like
to do this is chanel la romanesque which
is quite a nice pretty pinky purple it's
pretty late now it's 10:00 to 1:00 I've
had a really lazy lovely morning sitting
around in my pajamas eating baked beans
on toast
I found Sabrina the Teenage Witch on TV
which was amazing and rich has been
doing a bit of work I've been doing a
bit of like ADD mini stuff and now I am
how do you know I think we gotta go see
Anna and mark which would be really nice
it probably seems like we see them a lot
because I vlog on the days we see them
but actually it's not that often so it's
always very nice when we all get
together and I think we're gonna go to
Covent Garden haven't been there for a
while I kind of fancy a Shake Shack not
sure if we're gonna get that or not I
wanna go to new loo lemon so I don't
know we're gonna see where the day takes
us but I will bring you guys along with
me hopefully this won't be too long
because I know this vlog is already very
long feeling massively cast
right now but we're trying to find our
secret spot remember last time we came
to common garden we found a parking
business that looks like it's just for
electric cars but it's not know where it
is
we're gonna go see if we can find it
someone was in the space and they're
actually charging their electric cars
and I feel a bit guilty that we parked
there
and someone probably needed the charge
okay I found a spot while we wait for
Ana remarks I get here we are is good
secret
we're gonna go to you you lemon because
I really want to get some Pilates pants
I have some from like night a fine but
they've got zips on the back of the bomb
so when I'm doing my like rolls and
stuff it really hurts where does it fit
so don't really want to spend a fortune
but I've looked in a lot of places and
haven't found anything like high-waisted
and fit nicely so I'm gonna go have a
look at Lululemon do you need some
Pilates pants yeah okay 98 pounds for
leggings I think you have to some kind
of lunatic to spend 98 pounds on
leggings sorry but that is obscene try
not some making TV boxes fit unfit okay
I tried on both these ones were really
on fluffy and I don't like the soft
material but these ones are really good
they're called the thick with a plain I
did turn here I'm sure they had a name I
think they call it play dry I think I
could just you guys recommended these
ones they're really really long high
waisted no zips but they are 40 pounds
which is still quite expensive but not
coming to 95 farmers so I'm gonna get
these the lady in there was desperately
trying to get mr. chai on a small
because she said they come up so big I
was like seriously if you make me try
too small you're gonna ruin my entire
sudden day booleans ever try to meet you
I mean they were fine I knew they would
be but probably they come out really big
just I'm here to get them this is what
we will do in London they Sandra and
