on is because I meant that to head off
for my Friday morning Pilates session I
do it every week I can go for quite a
few months now it's like the only real
exercise I do and I'm actually really
enjoying it I'm getting better and
better each week at the beginning I
couldn't like even lift my legs up tall
and now I'm Way more flexible and my
really tight hamstrings and they're
loosening up a bit and I really like you
our class is very small as any like four
of us I don't know how anyone can do
those like big classes of like over 20
people because with Pilates if you just
get one slight movement wrong then
you're probably just going to do damage
to yourself and not good so the teacher
comes around and like corrects our
pelvis and the way our body is and I
love it it's like an hour every Friday
morning that I don't have my phone on
it's really nice so I'm gonna head off
there now I need to grab a banana first
I'm hungry no no no no I can feel a hay
fever the pollen count is high today
literally feed it right the top of my
nose any hay fever sufferers will
understand that feeling it's coming
I'm back and I wasn't very good today I
think my head just wasn't in it and my
back was hurting and I couldn't roll
like a ball like I could last week so
that's been frustrating but I'm gonna
have half bagel with some peanut butter
I haven't tried this one before we have
like a huge problem almond butter here
but not sure on the planet butter so I
think I'll stick to the peanut butter
I left my room in such a state this
morning so I need to sort this out
immediately
I'm now dressed and ready to face the
world I'm gonna head to the gleam office
my agent to say hi I have a little catch
up and I want to get a bottle of wine
for Melissa my manager because she has
had a rough week
some of my her team is away this week
says she's had like double the amount of
works a day and I know she loves a good
red wine so I'm going to take her bottle
of red wine Friday afternoon treats I
think she will enjoy that so I think I'm
gonna head into town and get it when I'm
there
hey I got the wine from Oliver bonus
I've returned and wrapped that around
the wine so additionally I died little
bit like a drunk though whipping around
or Salina I'm in the office now and Lucy
loved to the wine I'm just gonna check
my peer box this is my little box it has
my name on it
and it's just some stuff that some like
brands and stuff like to send me kind of
scary you here with these life-size
people
okay meeting done and I'm gonna head and
get some sushi because I haven't had to
make up which it's like off to now I'm
pretty hungry
sorry I didn't finish my vlog yesterday
but I got home and I felt really unwell
I had a really bad headache and I had a
nap and then it was too long and I woke
up really hot and dehydrated and it was
a bit of a write off so I am vlogging
today though I'm just getting ready for
the day

lovely day today so we're gonna have a
picnic with some friends so this morning
we need to go to the supermarket buy
some stuff and make some salads I really
don't want to buy like pita bread and
Hamas and pre-made coleslaw because I
just I never enjoy it it's like a lazy
way of doing a picnic so I want to go
and buy some stuff and make salads

having peanut butter bagel my mouth's
all like glued together this is what I'm
wearing today grey t-shirt my sunglasses

water and then I'm gonna bring it to the
boil and then turn it down a bit at like

pretty easy just struggling with the
pomegranate it's hard they are really
small pomegranates definitely not gonna
enough they pretty much all the
ingredients so they're in their pot from

give this salad a quick taste and then
it should be done when you have to put
