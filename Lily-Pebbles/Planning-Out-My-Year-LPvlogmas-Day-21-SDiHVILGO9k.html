t1
use my face I have no makeup on because
I'm gonna fill my makeup tutorial today
is a vlogmas dark circles I look
terrible I've just whipped up a fried
egg on sourdough very simple but I just
need to feed myself before filming some
videos I just edited last night's vlog
and it's so funny rich I need to show
you it's a really funny vlog I feel like
most of it won't make sense any of you
guys will show me like private jokes and
weird games that really don't translate
over vlog but I'd I'd leave it in anyway
because it was funny so I'm trying to
resist temptation going out today and
doing Christmassy stuff because I
figured if I film some videos now then
at least between Christmas and New Year
I could have some time off so that is
the plan I'm gonna film I knew XIV
makeup tutorial and my 2015 favorites
today hopefully if everything goes to
plan how are you gonna play xbox while
I'm filming so y'all hear the controller
and also the TV will be in the
background we can try and make it work
yeah I got my lights set up here put all
my products got there so many on the
chair there Rich's watching a film on
the sofa there I have my Christmas tree
in the background there and I have a
sparkling Year's Eve e-type top on so
hopefully this should all go to plan I'm
gonna sit and film now and I'll catch up
with you guys after I film my New Year's
Eve makeup tutorial now and I was gonna
fill my 2015 favorites but I'm feeling
really uninspired by it like I
personally don't like watching those
videos I find them really boring you
guys know what my favorite products have
been from the year like I talk about
them every month and all the time so I
might tweet and ask you guys what you
think and maybe how I can make it a bit
more interesting because I don't know
I'm just feeling like I don't want to
film it and I should go with that
feeling because I was it'll just come
out with a crap video but I just filmed
by 2015 favorites I didn't change it up
in the end because I didn't know what to
do and I know you guys would prefer 2015
favorites then nothing at all so I just
kind of talked through all my favorites
and you'll see that just after New
Year's Eve I think to try and turn off
this light there's a switch so I come to
videos today that's pretty successful I
hope they come out alright I still feel
so like cold E and it's annoying because
my time ease goes up by the time these
videos go up I won't have a cold and
I'll watch them back and be like ah but
I need to film them now
so I hope that you guys will enjoy those
I really hope that in the new year I can
start doing more new and interesting
videos and definitely going to try and
do that I'm going on a holiday at the
beginning of January with Rich's family
and I'm going to use that as like some
time out a little break and then I'm
going to come back and hopefully feel
refreshed and with some new ideas and
new content and some inspiration that is
hopefully the plan so I'm going to just
film the cutaways for my 2015 favorites
and then probably sit and edit both of
those videos two o'clock and time for
some fuel putting in pigs Express
American coffee so I always have one of
these in the freezer just in case of
emergencies
well the rich is just asking you can
have some oh I'm so hungry
yeah for sure now I've got plenty of
videos to edit see even getting more
done today look how cool this pizza
cutter is its riches rich who bought
this for you present birthday present
it's actually really good pizza cutter
works really well and it's cool to sit
and enjoy my pizza and then start
editing it's already quarter to four and
I have nothing to update you on we're
watching Michael Buble Christmas song
book and I'm I've just finished it's
editing my music tutorial I'm just
scheduled in tonight's blog and then I'm
gonna start editing my 2015 favourite so
it's like I'm not gonna be leaving the
house now until I go to Keisha's later
she's having like a little reunion
dinner with like lots of people
obviously we saw her yesterday but she's
inviting people to our house for dinner
while she's here so I'll be going to
that as well but until then me and rich
is just chilling rich is doing wedding
stuff and I'm doing work stuff I've
edited my 2015 beauty favorites woop
there's two videos filmed and edited by
five o'clock you have done pretty well
although I've got a terrible vlog
because of that I've had a lot being
developed today I am just gonna export
the video and upload it and add in all
the links and information which is kind
of the boring part I filled out all the
product description for my new XIV
makeup tutorial video now I just have to
schedule the Facebook post and my tweets
because I do that for every video just
so I can let you guys know that it's
gone up and I normally do a post on
Facebook and then I do
like three or four tweets on Twitter
just to say like a new video up so I
kind of pre-scheduled those so they're
just ready to go are we gonna head out
with the quiches now and pick up my
friend Mars on the way I look like such
a mess I think it's just like a casual
girls night so I'm not gonna make an
effort I'm just wearing my like Santa
jumper and tracksuit bottoms and I
really you know you've been in all day
and you've been in like comfy clothes
I just got both to get on and get
dressed upon proper clothes so I don't
think they're gonna mind you rockin up

just made dinner I don't know what she's
made she was panicking about yesterday
so let's see what she decided to make
but I'm gonna go pick up Mars now rich

are you doing I think you have to make

raucous curse in a pepper with kidney
beans on top and what spinach garlic

Christmas trying to revise into Keisha's
house though is the hardest part of
seeing Keyshia been a while now it's
beeping like a homicide I'm is
ignoring the beeps now okay thank you

triangular and oh my god tiny crackers

Keisha and everyone we had a really
yummy dinner we played Christmas games
yeah I'm home
tummyache actually probably be doing all
evening
you know what did you make these stuffed
peppers oh yeah at work
yeah I still one left whiskers click
yeah all right try it and then I watched
some Sopranos played a bit Xbox watch
the Arsenal game what you know music and
lyrics oh yeah listen Kara muskets bed
in a minute but before I do I've just
got this plane on my mind that I really
want to have an annual like a whole year
calendar on my wall I really I wanted to
that loves January I'll have a fresh
start and I'm really excited about kind
of I'm just excited for January it
started in me yeah and I really want to
have my year on the wall so I could just
plan out my whole year I like to look
ahead it makes me feel less anxious
about life I like to just plan out my
year I know that's a bit extreme and
ahead and things will change and stuff
will pop up I like to plan ahead and I
really want to have a whole calendar but
couldn't find like a good calendar
that's basically a whole year so what
I've done is I've been looking on Etsy
for a principle calendar one that you
normally kind of flip but then I'm just
gonna print out the pages and then I
think I'm gonna blue tack them on the
wall in my office and then I can write
like any trips I've got coming up and
cool stuff and big life events so I've
just found this one it's like two pounds
and let me go back it looks really
pretty
pages look like this there won't be that
much space to write but I can write
underneath the numbers and I think will
look cool on the wall as well so I think
I'm gonna buy that now and then print it
from my printer look already download it
and I can print it I was invited in
instead I love when you'd have to wait
for delivery
oh the printers doing something come on
sometimes this printer takes ages to get
going
it makes us really weird noise and ours
like a heart attack
come on printer you can do it when it's
ready the front pops open it's always a
very exciting moment please wait
momentarily it's never momentarily it's
always so long come on
yes it's like princes giving birth
there's no colour so this shouldn't take
long January oh man it's gonna come out
backwards I think what I'm gonna do is
get some like polystyrene and kind of
mount it on it so it's slightly sticking
it away from the wall because I think
that I'll make it look a bit more
expensive and less like I stuck paper on
the wall so I might like mount it
slightly and then blue tack the
polystyrene I think a trip to hobby
craft as needed
Jan you for every March and you grab
January so I can show you what it looks
like so that's what it looks like so
that's okay maybe there's not that much
space for me to write but I could always
like circulate and then write what it is
next to it or just right underneath it
won't be anything more than like VidCon
wedding or something like that it's just
nice to be able to map out the year and
see what all the dates are I have a
thought of the day Y in calendars and
stuff does it always start Sunday Monday
Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
Saturday in my mind Monday is the
beginning of the week but in things like
this they we starts this Sunday I don't
know if that's a really stupid comment
and I'm sorry if it is but I don't like
I thought Monday was the first day of
the week okay rich said he's gonna help
me with this tomorrow this is our
project for tomorrow okay I've started
pay more attention to my skin recently
and it's working so I'm gonna keep going
with it and tonight I'm gonna give
myself a little bit of a pamper skin
routine well I put this from Muji
recently I'm gonna put this on it's like
a stops on the product getting in your
hair for though my hair is dirty very
fetching I'm gonna wash my hands I'm not
wearing that much eye makeup today so
I'm
I'm gonna take my omen concept protists
can use my boss here huh that's not
finished my guys get back up just in
case I'm just gonna use this to take
mine off lighting in here is so bad for
the spotlights it's good for life
there's terrible videos this one takes
off I make up really well you guys have
seen me use there's plenty of times I
think I'm gonna double cleanse if I can
feel that my eyelashes are still like
crusty so usually when I do this I
normally watch videos and I always make
time to properly remove my makeup and
cleanse my skin and I actually quite
enjoy it now it's like my time to watch
videos and wash my face
I've removed most of the makeup and now
I want to really cleanse my skin so I'm
going to use their mo Hardy cleansing
balm and just like scoop a bit out into
my fingers and then just melt that into
the skin and this also get rid of any
mascara that I've left on
I don't always double cleanse but
because I found a makeup tutorial today
I was wearing quite a lot of makeup okay
I'm gonna do a quick face mask I did one
of these last night and really helped my
skin this is the ESOP parsley seed mask
which is my favorite one of the masks I
have especially when my skin is feeling
a little bit spotty it just like brings
it all out of the skin but this is a I
only do this one on like special
occasions because it takes slightly
longer than my other masks I have to
leave this on for about 15-20 minutes I
like to use a brush to apply it because
then I don't have to get my hands or
Groppi it's also really quick it's like
face painting really see what I'm doing
okay so I've just applied a thin layer
of that all over and I'm gonna leave it
to dry and you'll see as it dries it
kind of dries and patches a little bit
you know what that's about what it means
but feels great on the skin and then
it's really not that hard to remove so
I'll be back in 15 minutes and then
launch a video okay so can you see the
mask now has gone like all funny and
patchy and hard in place
so that's when you know that it's time
to take it off keep the Muslims off
quite wet and then start wiping off the
skin it comes off way easier than like a
lot of charcoal masks and I hate having
to tuck in the skin this one kind of
melts away and my skin always was really
clean and fresh afterwards I'm going to
use my Estee Lauder advanced night
repair which is a really hydrating serum
a couple of drops of that and then I'm
going to use the face oil because my
skin is really dry at the moment I think
you love being oils I think I'm gonna
use this one from Chi press I think it's
called a beauty elixir one and sees
about four drops of this and that's
pretty much my skincare routine done so
I'm gonna brush my teeth and head to bed
highlight of the day I pretty much
worked all day so tonight seeing Keyshia
and my friends and having a nice dinner
was definitely my highlight I'm
definitely starting to wind down for
Christmas now so I have two more vlogs
left tomorrow's vlog might be a bit
boring as well because I'm probably just
hanging out at my parents house all day
and all night cuz I think my mom's
having a party for the neighbors and
then on the 23rd we're driving up to
North before we go to Suffolk so that
blog might be a bit more interesting and
then that's it Vogler's will be over so
see you guys tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
