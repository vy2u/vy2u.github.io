good morning it's now half 1:00 in the
afternoon we got back really late last
night we had our McDonald's it was great
we showered washed hair when it's been
about 2 o'clock which was weird I wasn't
even tired when I went to bed and then
we woke up this morning and we were like
this flat needs a serious clean I left
in such like a sick state it was all
like fluid and gross so we gave a really
good clean this morning we've got
ourselves ready
I edited my blog I did my December
favorites video and uploaded that and
now we're finally kind of finished
Richard's just playing on the Xbox while
I finish getting ready I'm gonna clean
my ears and then we have to head out
because we've got a few more Christmas
presents to buy this is like the last
day that I feel like we've got free to
do Christmas present stuff so we're
gonna go get some of those and then do a
food shop and then I think we're gonna
come back and start wrapping Christmas
presents and try and get that Christmas
see it's actually feeling that a lot
more Christmassy in London then it
wasn't Fianna which is strange but the
weather's really weird and warm but
we're gonna put some Christmas music on
and maybe make some mulled wine and then
we're going out tonight so for my
brother-in-law's birthday so we have a
fun afternoon and evening planned but we
had a chilled morning kind of to get us
in the mood today I'm wearing my new
beanie from Zara I really like this
hatch leave my leather jacket from ASOS
my Lily and Lionel scarf my M&amp;amp;S
Christmas jumper that I can't take off
because it's so soft my Topshop ripped
Jamie jeans I think my daddy does
trainers and this bag is a really nice
soft leather bag from Olive Cooper ready
for school Christmas shopping
we really should write less though right
you know list checking it twice us know
not how it goes we don't want to spend
those money and we don't to be too long
so we can actually get shopping so I
think we only go to Chipotle for a quick
return
I'm so embarrassed
we just messaged our friends whatsapp
group we were like oh we're off the
street penny ones around and our friend
Bob was like yeah I'm in fire and I'm
upstairs come say hi
so we went in and went upstairs and I
went up to a guy I think it was Rob Rob
wasn't in there he was just joking
we're now home and I lit my German own
candle and I put all the presents out
and wrapping paper and I'm gonna do some
rapping I have about that many presents
actually just mainly like which is
family My Secret Santa for tomorrow for
my friends and then my one Secret Santa
present for my family I'm gonna wrap
them all in front of the tree and
hopefully find a nice Christmas films
watched as well
which is gonna open up the little book
of the champagne that Jay gave us
my least favorite part of wrapping
presents is cutting the wrapping paper
I've never really figured out how to do
it well always very frustrating I've
done well those got one two three four
presents wrapped it's a good hour or two
later and really start getting ready for
tonight and I've wrapped all the
presents put them all under the tree I
went for this kind of brown with gold
star paper a little bit string and some
gift tags from Paper Chase as well in it
very pretty under the tree which is very
helpful with the raft boom not not
helpful
so today's vlog has been really short I
don't remember actually filming anything
today I'm not sure why I think me and
Mitchell arguing for most of the day so
that was the whole bit of log and then I
was wrapping presents and that's pretty
much all we've done this afternoon I'm
now ready to go out for my
brother-in-law's birthday we're going to
like a southern American restaurant
maybe I'm not really sure I've just put
on my Lillian Lionel shirt
and spawn a necklace actually and just
some black jeans and boots I think it's
pretty casual and obviously max or and
their lip although my lips are pretty
sore from being a little bit dry so
let's see how this lasts haven't opened
my jo Malone calendar today what's the
date rich Oh Crapo needs mate musli wait
I'm gonna come back to the day all I
need to do is just fill a bowl with oats
cover it with milk so it's overnight hmm
I think this is bigger
okay I just got like normal plain
porridge oats I'm going to fill up the
bowl rich stop shouting Chris's phones
that may have broken my mother do it all
okay now I'm gonna take some semi
skimmed milk we normally have skimmed
but I think for this semi-skilled
rubella and then I'm just gonna cover
the outside the milk
completely cover them and milk well it's
a seriously satisfying
there you go
covered I've just covered the bowl put
in the fridge and we leave it overnight
and then the rest of the work is
tomorrow morning okay now I can open
number 19 see what's in here

however say that haven't got long I
really need to pay my nails because
they're so chipped so I go into my nail
draw all right now far but nail polish
remover in here Seche vite top row sally
hansen base coat and then i want a color
that's gonna last me maybe SC soulmate
that's a good color for this time of
year
maybe I want a red hmm color binge Essie
don't worry red or dark yeah I don't
know I don't know they will get red
actually bit different
whilst Lily's painting her nails and
waiting for carly men to come pick us up
i thought as we're not driving we'd have
a little Christmas cheer
the excited Lily yeah honey so I found
stashed away in our cupboard this little
with it

espressos and coffee shops I've put it
in a champagne glass you gave me loads
yeah sorry like too much watching like

good loss food was alright but it was
also really awkward guy like singing it
really wasn't very good but it was fun
night heading home now we are home and
I'm doing have no other plans for today
and I feel like today's vlog has been
really short but I don't know what else
to say
what's the time now it's 11:00 so I
could probably edit this vlog now before
I go to bed cuz tomorrow's a busy day
I'm having brunch with Esther Keisha and
Jenny they're coming here and then I'm
going home to my parents and then I'm
going to my uncle's Christmas party

can vlog and then you know guys the pub

of us and we always do Secret Santa and
I got robbed so excited to give him his
present and we're gonna wear Christmas
jumpers and have mulled wine yeah we
just can't see Star Wars in the morning
I think like I'm the only person in the
world has no interest in Star Wars it's
not that I don't like it I've never
actually seen Star Wars before I know
that's probably like when Anna tells me
she hasn't seen et but I just have no
interest in it one day I'll probably
force myself to watch it it just doesn't
really seem like my cup of tea but I do
at the moment feel like I am the only
person in the world which is just
hanging all the washing-up like a
domestic god yes I'm gonna sign off now
thanks for watching and I'll see you
wait I love the day wrapping the
Christmas presents and putting them
under the tree doll of the day
no shit which you we doing you know very
consistent with your themes or you you
had about four thoughts of the day and
then since then you haven't had any if
we should stop doing them at the end you
should just do them when you have them
