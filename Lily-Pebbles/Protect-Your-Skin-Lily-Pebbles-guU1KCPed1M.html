super quick video hopefully it's gonna
be quick because I can't currently move
very much I have surgical tape all over
me you can see a bit like here as well I
want to talk today about protecting your
skin in particular about moles and it's
a bit of a kind of touchy sensitive
subject for me for a couple of reasons
but I've decided I want to talk about it
because I got an amazing reaction on
Twitter this morning when I did start
talking about it and it inspired me
because a lot of people said yeah do it
they'll be led to support la la la la so
I thought it might be a good video to
talk about it's a touchy subject for me
because last year I lost my auntie to
melanoma and it's also a massive
insecurity of mine moles in general if
properly I would say my biggest
insecurity and I know it's probably a
bit pathetic because it's not all about
looks but since a young age I've always
been very kind of embarrassed about them
and hated them and bitter about the fact
that I can't really change it I can't
get a nose job I can't get a boob job
they're there forever and I used to be
very upset about that and as I grow up
it's still kind of something that
frustrates me I never feel like I have
beautiful skin because I've got moles
everywhere but whatever I'm learning to
deal with it the reason I wanted to talk
about this today is because I think a
lot of people don't realize that if you
have moles that you should get them
checked and first of all I hate the word
moles
it's a horrible word and because of that
stupid Austin Powers film with the moly
moly moly thing bloody hate that film
literally caused so much stress in my
childhood I used to cry about that when
boys at school used to shout that at me
and even into my adult days there's
always people who make that joke and I
just don't get it at all I think it's
horrible and you know I hate that word I
grew up calling the beauty spots that's
what my mom told me they were called and
I think that's a much nicer name for
them but whatever they're called if you
have them you have them and you know
like me I've got them everywhere and and
it's really important to get them
checked even before my auntie passed
away my dad has always gone to get his
checked once a year we go to a skincare
specialist in Harley Street in London
but we go once a year
I actually got five moles removed this
morning that's why I have surgical tape
all over me and I thought it might help
if I talk through the process and my
personal experiences with having moles
and getting them checked I think it's
different for everyone and I'm in no way
a skin expert so I don't want to be
throwing out any facts here I will link
some stuff below that you can look into
it more this is more just about my
personal experience so me and my dad go
once a year to this lady and we normally
kind of strip down into underwear and
because she's trained she can just look
and they call it mole mapping she can
just look at all our molds and she'll
know like she nobody says all that one's
interesting and then she'll circle it
with a biro and then the ones that she
thinks are interesting she calls it she
has a little machine and it just kind of
looks like a torch and she holds it up
to the skin and a little light comes on
and it's completely pain-free and it
brings up a picture of the mole like
super zoomed in on a camera on a screen
sorry and on that there will be two
colors blue and green and that kind of
shows the activity I guess like
cancerous activity or just activity
showing that it's developing into
something possibly and a few of mine
showed a bit of activity my dad's
because he's older had like more
activity but mine showed that they could
develop into something so in that case
it can be recommended to get them
removed and once they're removed that's
it they're kind of gone and they send
them off for tests so personally for me
I think it's definitely worth getting
them removed because I don't want that
to develop into something that could be
dangerous or life-threatening so I had
five removed this morning as I said and
I thought I'd tell you guys about how it
went just in case any of you were too
nervous to go in to get checked because
you don't really know like how it works
this is how it works of me there's kind
of a few different ways if you're
squeamish maybe turn off now but they
numb the area where the mole is with an
injection and that was the bit that I
thought quite her I hate injections and
it did pinch quite a lot and once that's
done the whole area is really numb and
then what she does as horrible as it
sounds sorry she kind of shaves the top
of the mole off and until she does that
she doesn't know where the chest to cut
in or not if it's still there in my
dad's case they had to like cut in quite
a lot and then they give you stitches
but you have to get removed but some of
mine they didn't have to do that it was
just kind of an exterior thing so that's
fine then they put kind of padding on
and tape it up and I'll take that off
tomorrow take a few painkillers and it
should all be fine if you have stitches
you just have to go back to have them
taken out the procedures really quick
and easy and it's pretty pain free not
gonna lie I passed out this morning but
it's not really because of the pain I
think it's just because I hiked up a lot
in my head and it was very hot in the
hospital and all got a bit much food
because I had five all on my torso but
my back and my stomach it fell a bit
like I was getting hacked so I did get a
bit hot and flustered afterwards and
fainted a little bit but not the end of
the world I still think it's majorly
important to have it done and I'm glad I
did so if you do have a lot of moles or
beauty spots like me it's really
important that you you can go and speak
to your GP and they can refer you on to
a specialist or they can just look at
any that you think might be suspicious
and tell you what they think it's just
worth speaking someone I know it's a bit
of an embarrassing subject I probably
wouldn't have done it if I didn't get to
go with my dad he kind of made me feel
like it's okay to talk about it but it
is really important I'm not gonna really
talk about some cream and SPF because I
know a lot of people have different
opinions on that the way I deal with it
is when I was younger I loved getting a
tan but now I'm older and wiser I try
not selling the Sun too much I always
wear factor 30 or plus when I'm in
holiday and I definitely don't sunbathe
like midday when it's like proper proper
Sun it's just not worth it for me and
it's just not worth it for a tan there
are some things you can look out for on
your moles there's like a 5-step of
things ABCD or something that you can
check if they're irregular shapes or
change color but personally I found it
really hard to keep track of all of mine
and I can't see my back and it's just
really hard so I prefer going to see
someone once a year so that they can
keep track of them instead anyway this
has been a bit of a random video but
something that I thought might help a
lot of you because I know a lot of
people have moles it's really common
which is just bizarre because I've grown
up thinking oh my god I'm the only
person who feels this way but I'm pretty
sure I'm not so maybe this has helped
you definitely go and get them checked
when you can if you can the doctor will
not find it bizarre it's very very
normal and let me know if you have had
any similar experiences I'm gonna go
grab a neuro firm because I'm in a
little bit of pain right now but thank
you guys for watching let me know what
you think of this please be nice and
I'll see you in my next video
