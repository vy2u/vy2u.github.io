very chilled I'm sitting on the little
sofa up here and I'm just gonna be
answering some of your questions I put
on Twitter that was gonna do a little
kind of hash tag ask LP thing so I told
you to send over your questions any
topics and I've got quite a few here to
go through so I'm just gonna chill and
work my way through some of your
questions I'm gonna put all the names of
the people who are asking these
questions in the info box below so we're
gonna get deep with the first one advice
on how to get more confident within
yourself and your appearance so I
actually did a video with my friends
talking about how different we are now
compared to when we were teenagers so I
will link that below it was a really
nice video to film and I think just kind
of first of all give it time you will
become more confident as you go up
naturally but also if you're insecure
about your appearance try and focus on
the things you like about the way you
look rather than dwelling on the things
that you don't like surround yourself
with lovely people who make you feel
more confident and don't put you down
and I think that's the the best advice I
can give I live in the States if I was a
UK tourist one day what should I
definitely not miss whoo that's hard
okay I think my perfect day in London
would be this is kind of avoiding any of
the Big Bend touristy stuff because I
don't know the things as interesting I
would start in North London take a walk
through Primrose Hill and there's a bit
where you can walk over to read its Park
and you can walk alongside the London
Zoo and see into the zoo without
actually having to pay to go in I do
that walk quite a lot and then I'd have
breakfast in Primrose Hill there's a
little cafe called Greenbury which is
really nice for like a healthy breakfast
then Primrose Hill is quite near to
Camden so I would walk over to Camden
and go and look at the amazing market
and can but it's really colourful
there's like clothes and junu bits you
can buy and I think it's amazing if you
like photography and taking photos from
Camden I would get the tube to central
London and go to Soho and go to
Liberty's of London it's amazing old
building definitely amazing if you can
select architecture and then walk
through Carnaby Street where there's not
lots of other kind of cute shops then
you can kind of walk through Soho and go
through Chinatown if you like there's a
lot of stuff going on in Soho then I'd
probably walk to Covent Garden it's not
that far from Soho to Covent Garden and
I would have lunch in Covent Garden
there's a place called Home Slice that
do the most amazing piece of toppings
you can either get pizza
slice or get 22-inch and share and
they're huge and amazing no no no after
lunch maybe do it a shopping and come
garden oh I know I'd walk over Waterloo
Bridge and go to South Bank there's a
lot of stuff going on South Bank it's
loads of like history there as well I
love the South Bank and there's in the
summer like something called underbelly
where you can have Pimm's and drinks
outside and there's always like little
beaches and funny little things going on
so that would be my perfect day in
London how did you decide to cut off
your hair and how you deal with it in
humidity I have always wanted to have
hair kind of this length a bit shorter
but when I was younger it just wasn't
good enough quality to have it sure it
would have gone really puffy and big so
last year a couple years ago I just felt
like my hair looked like it was this
length but then down here was just some
like straggly long bit that they look
like two separate bits of hair so one
day I just said to my hairdresser let's
just give it a go and you kind of
chopped it to there and I'm so happy I
think I'll definitely keep it this
length forever I just look too young
with long hair and it's so much easier
to look after I think just using good
heat protectors on this kind of hair is
really important and using oils and
moisturizing creams how do you keep
yourself motivated whilst being your own
boss it is really hard especially if
you're working at home to keep motivated
but I don't know how I do I think when
you are working for yourself it means so
much to you to do well and do your best
because it's your own thing no one's
telling you to do it you're doing it
yourself so that alone kind of motivates
me also no matter how old you are I
think you always want to kind of prove
to your parents that you're doing well
and that kind of keeps me going every
time something happens I'm proud of it's
really nice to be able to tell my
parents look what I did I've reached
200,000 subscribers or anything like
that I never I was never a
self-motivated person before so I guess
when you just find something that you
love that's alone motivates you what
would you be doing if you weren't doing
YouTube I get asked this a lot and I
have mentioned it before I would
probably be working in marketing and
social media because that's what I was
doing before I did a marketing degree
and then I started working in PR and
ended up in marketing and social media
so I'd probably be doing that for a
brand um yeah it's not that glamorous
but that's what I would have been doing
what's your favorite milkshake
definitely chocolates quite like a weak
chocolate I like chocolate and vanilla
mixed if you could be any age for a week
what age would you be probably 19 that's
been my favorite age so far in my 26
years of life I was traveling I was at
my gap year I traveled to like Australia
and Thailand and Fiji and had the best
time and I felt like I had no worries I
had a year out after school before
University and it was just really fun
here and I feel like 19 is a really good
age do your videos of vlogs reflect your
real life do you ever have a same pair
of knickers two days in a row kind of
week I definitely don't have a same pair
of knickers two days in a row that makes
me feel quite sick but I'd say they're
pretty good reflection when I do vlog I
normally only vlog about three days of
the week not every single day so
obviously I'm gonna vlog the days where
I'm out going to cool launches or going
off dinner with friends and I'm not
gonna vlog the days where I'm just at
home working because although I feel
like that shows a better reflection of
what I do it's just not that interesting
to watch so it's a bit of a mix
sometimes I show myself just at home
working but I normally just blog the fun
stuff so next time you watch my vlog
just remember it's only about three days
of the week how did you first introduce
rich to your parents and what's the best
way to do so have you ever dated someone
your parents didn't like rich met my
parents for the first time when me and
my family rented a house in the
countryside for the weekend and it
wasn't that far from where his family
live in Suffolk so he popped down to say
hi and I was quite nervous but as soon
as he walked in my mom just said what
can you help make the scrambled eggs and
like go I'm in the kitchen and my
parents are quite good at making people
feel at ease my family are very kind of
loud and chatty and no one's awkward so
I think he fit in straight away and
which is just hilarious he says the
funniest thing so that means too and I
think my family liked that about him
have I ever dated someone that my
parents don't like I don't think so well
they haven't told me I think some of my
ex-boyfriends my friends weren't that
keen about but if you have good
supportive friends and they just kind of
go with it until it becomes a problem my
hair is similar to yours and I love
straightening it do you also get lots of
people telling you to just embrace the
curls yes I get a lot of people my
friends do it anymore where you guys
always tell me to embrace the curls I
don't want to I like my hair like this
it's a long story but it just makes me
feel better so no I don't want to
embrace the cars right now
are you accomplishing your dreams I'm
not really the sort of person to set
dreams when I was young enough to have
dreams I just wanted to be a pop star
and that wasn't really a real dream and
I think when I grew up I didn't really
set myself dreams I've always loved the
idea of getting married and having kids
and having a family but then as you grow
up you realize that's not gonna happen
when you're 26 as much as I used to say
when I'm 27 I want to have a house and
three kids and that's just not reality
I was never career focused when I was
younger but now I really am so I'm just
enjoying kind of working Lots working
really hard and enjoying it and then in
feeis time I will enjoy marriage and
kids and all that stuff what's your
favorite Disney song and character
that's too hard I can't think of one I'm
just gonna think of the first one they
cost my head which is like father bear
necessities the simple bare necessities
Jungle Book and yeah Baloo he's a cool
dude any tips for someone finishing
school next year and don't know what to
do after that I don't know if you mean
like school or uni but I guess this
applies to both because I just interned
a lot if you can it's hard to intern it
depends if you have somewhere to live if
you're like near a city or something but
a lot of my friends ended up staying
living with cousins for a while and
aunties and uncles interning is the best
thing you can do in my opinion I did it
both after school in my gap here and
between summers each year at uni and
after uni not only is a good way to
figure out what sort of job you like you
can try lots of different things and you
say oh I don't like that part of PR or I
didn't like this part of marketing or
whatever you want to go into it's a good
way to test it out it also looks really
good on your CV I think by the time I
got my first proper job I had two pages
worth of interning and it just makes you
look really proactive and it gives you
sites to talk about it in interviews
when they say tell me about the time you
solved a problem or tell me something
that's not great good about yourself you
know there's annoying interview
questions if you have a lot of
experience in interning even if it's
just two weeks here in there it gives
you something to talk about in an
interview what three songs take you back
to your teenage years oh that's hard to
think on the spot and Blu Cantrell
breathe they really need some time alone
we need to let it breathe and it's like
that and that's the way it is I don't
remember who that was but I remember
having that on CD oh and Jack Johnson
banana pancakes those are the first
three that I can think of really weird
selection of songs did you meet Viviana
makeup through YouTube you seem like
you've been friends all your life it's
lovely I get this question all the time
me and Ana met through blogging we had
both had our blogs for a couple of years
and we read each other's blogs and
watched others videos and we first met
at Zooey used to be the London lip gloss
and that is now Zoe London she was in my
multiple AAG she launched a lipstick
with a brand and me and Hannah both went
to the launch and we both met there and
that was about three years ago and I
don't know we just clicked I mean I have
lots of friends in the blogging world
but me and Anna just very similar so we
are very very good friends now and it's
really nice do you plan on getting a lot
more tattoos no I really don't want to
have lots of tattoos all over me I don't
know why I keep getting them they're
just really addictive but I I like how
when someone looks at me they don't know
I've got five tattoos I don't want to
have lots of tattoos and display but I
do like all the ones I have and I'm
happy with them never gonna say I'm not
gonna get any more because knowing me
something will happen and after they
think oh this is a great opportunity to
get a tattoo every summer I want a
tattoo but nothing big oh that's all the
questions I'm done oh that was really
fun I might do more of these videos let
me know if you enjoyed this and if you
want me to do more in the future because
it's quite nice to just chill and sit
and talk to you guys thank you so much
for watching and thanks to everyone who
tweeted me with questions I'll see you
