I think that's where I would like to get
my honey beige cheeky Anisa us which is
my favourite Disney movie and why I
think I'd have to say the jungle book
partly because it's my dad's favorite so
he made us watch it a lot when we were
growing up but I love all the songs and
the characters and it just reminds me of
my childhood
Alice M asked if you could have any
superpower what would it be
this one is really hard all I could
think up straight away it was Sabrina
the Teenage Witch I just wanted to be

things and just make it move and come to
be a bit like Matilda I just want to be
screaming in anguish chasing Candy's
fast
did you know Viviana before YouTube and
how did you two become friends well
actually she's not really my friend
she's just my own camera system only
joking oh we did not know each other
before YouTube I'm vlogging we met about
a year and a half two years ago maybe
and we were both working in the same job
we're both working for beauty box
companies like competitors and doing the
same job so we met at like a keep
blogging event and kind of bonded over
the fact that we did the same thing as
our full-time job and she's just one of
those people that we just hit it off
straightaway all mine on vlogging
friends think is hilarious that I've met
someone that's so similar to me so yeah
we just get on really well unique we 96

other youtuber who would it be and why I
would love to get my makeup done by Lisa
Eldridge and also by Sam Chapman I've
been watching both their channels
forever and they're just incredible
makeup artists so I would love to just
sit there and they can just transform me
that's the dream
Nina de Groot asked do I want to be a
mother at some point in my life I would
absolutely love to I'm the youngest of

dream I had was horrific and it was with
me Anna and Patricia Fripp top princess

whole day and I died in my dream and I
was very sad and I had to go into her
blog and take up for her to get up short
boats Russia asked how do you keep your
hair healthy when you straighten it a
lot
the key is use a lot of heat protector
before you straighten it and I also
might they let my hair dry naturally
before I straighten if I can so I don't
have to use a hair dryer so I use like
any serums that help it dry quicker and
then yeah you do have transfers
bracket makeup asked how do you handle
negativity on YouTube I think everybody
gets it that some ik that's important to
remember it's not personal to you and
just try remember it's not about you I
think it's all about the person
commenting and kind of their
insecurities and just feel comfortable
in your own skin that hopefully it
shouldn't really matter what someone
says bye

the story behind why you started to a
blog and YouTube I started my blog at
uni as part of my marketing like online
marketing cause they said start a blog
and give it a go so I had it as a hobby
and then I started my youtube a few
years later because there's some things
that you just need to talk about is that
a right world of Katie asks what's your
favorite school memory I'm still best
friends with my friends were primary
school so we're always laughing about
funny memories we used to have a little
gang that we called bad when we were
about six and we used to push each other
over so we can steal plasters from the
nurse's office and just do really
naughty things really really page us
what's your monthly her name is Carol
with an easier Ronny ball says Lily any
tips on how to diminish an accidental
heavy hand with the blush what I would
do is just use my buffing brush that I
use for my foundation and go over
I blush a little bit and it blends it in
and makes it a bit softer Shawnee land a
very frequent commenter on my channel
asked how long did it take for your
audience to grow and how did you go
about making it would Ian's grow

Lisa R 12 says what have been your
previous jobs before YouTube so when I
left uni I interned for quite a few PR
agencies I tried agencies i PR at
Selfridges in-house and then I got into
production making adverts I also worked
in music licensing which is like when
you have music on YouTube videos and
then eventually I got into beauty and
worked my way up from intern to
marketing manager Allis driver says if
you weren't a beauty blogger what job
would you like to do if I wasn't doing
this then it's quite likely I'd be doing
marketing or social media for a brand
but I think if I could completely start
again and just do anything I'd really
like to do like interior design it's
something I'm not particularly good at
but I always find really interesting and
really Roth says what are your plans for
the future career-wise do you want to
quit blogging and blogging at some point
and do something else I think like
everybody and no matter what job they're
doing never really sure where it kind of
takes them what they'll be doing in like
five years time well I love what I'm
doing at the moment I love doing like
present work and creative really I never
knew I was going to end up doing this so
it could lead on to anything I just like
being creative I like making videos and
I like writing tester Jackson said if
you could go back in time would you have
done
