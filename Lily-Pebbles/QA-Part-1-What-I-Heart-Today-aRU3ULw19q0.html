part of my Q&amp;amp;A video a few videos back
or else you'll to ask me any questions
and I pick my favorites and Noah loads
and so many that I wanted answer so I'm
going to have to split it this video's
two parts I'm sorry if that's annoying
but I think it's better than having one
really long video so I'm going to get
started in this video it's going to be
education work live blogging and YouTube
and then the next video it's going to be
personal stuff and beauty fashion and
then some funny random questions so I've
got my notepad here sorry if you can see
it i'm not going to be able to remember
the questions otherwise and i'm gonna
get started with education so for some
reason loads of you wanted to know like
what I studied I don't know why I think
that's really boring but that was
probably the most asked questions like
would you do it you nice oh and for GCSE
I studied all the normal subjects plus
French arts and music I did do Italian
but me and the teacher really didn't get
on so i ended up quitting and then i was
also made to do single science so that i
was more likely to pass so i ended up
only doing seven I think I got five B's
into C's which was pretty good for my
kind of standard I definitely wasn't
like an A grade person at school and I
didn't do very well at school I didn't
really get the whole kind of authority
thing I kind of struggled in school but
yeah GCC 5 b's TCS that was fine for me
fayez levels i studied art theatre
studies music technology clearly will
like the creative subjects and
psychology but psychology I got EU in
which is unclassified so that got
dropped when I carried on doing the
other three for a levels I think I to
get permission for my head mistress to
do art music and drama i think it was
quite a rare thing but yeah i like the
creative subjects the only problem with
that is with subjects like art and music
you have to have a really kind of war
talent to do whether it's not be
something you can learn so i didn't do
very well i gotta c and 2 d's in my a
levels but surprisingly it was enough to
get into uni I didn't want to apply for
uni it was never something I had a plan
to do I personally thought that you knew
is only good if he kind of wants to be a
doctor or lawyer other than that I think
experience is more important so I wasn't
going to go but my career
teacher convinced me to try for at least
one uni so i did i tried for one uni one
course only and I got it I got an
unconditional offer I didn't even need
an interview so maybe my personal
statement was really good or something I
got in and I went to birmingham city
university which then it was called
university of central england i studied
marketing advertising and PR my uncle
was in advertising or is an advertising
and it's something I've always kind of
enjoyed the look of I thought it was
something quite practical that actually
be able to do after uni I didn't really
see the point of doing kind of English
your mouths not that I could have but
something like that I just didn't really
know what I would do with it if I was
going to go and spend all that money I
wanted to do something I would actually
be able to get a job in afterwards so I
did that I absolutely loved it then I
loved the way you nee worked like
different to school is much more casual
work at your own pace you're much more
like a level with the lecturers and I
actually enjoyed the education side of
it much more than I thought so I worked
my ass off pretty much going with a good
crowd we all helped each other and I
ended up getting the first which was
someone who never got an A in school
like ever got an a I think once i got an
a when my sister's boyfriend did my
homework for me I was pretty impressed
with the first I was very proud of
myself and I think my parents were too
which is great I also loved uni because
it was an opportunity for me to live
away from home and gain some sort of
life experiences I did go on a gap year
before my uni I went to Australia
Thailand Fiji in LA for four months and
that was also really good to kind of
independent experience I would recommend
the course I did at uni I learned about
social media I learned about marketing I
learned about PR I learned everything I
seem to be using now in life so it was
really good and I did a lot of
presenting which has helped me kind of
build my confidence I was would never
that presented anything before uni but
now I'm quite confidently doing that
probably made it easier for me to film
videos the fact that i had to do so many
presentations at unique so after uni i
interned a lot i actually interned in
the summers in between each year at uni
as well I summaries and got stuck in my
head I freaked out thinking like this
degree is not going to help me get job
and I just had a feeling
people are going to want to look your cv
and experience my cv was bare so every
summer between uni I interned or got a
job I worked at a production company
they were making adverts I was a runner
on adverts and like people running
around doing everything after uni I in
turn for about nine months I interned at
Frank PR which is a PR agency helps of
contact journalists and send out samples
and things like that I also interned at
Selfridges press office I interned Holly
remember internet so many places
basically built my CV up within space
for five months I had like two pages
worth of my CV I then got a job in I
don't even know if I'm missing anything
that currently remember but I got a job
in music licensing which is pretty
random some of the ones were going to
I'm fashion and beauty PR but my whole
family in music industry and I kind of
wasn't loving fashion PR wasn't loving
the people in the industry so I thought
I'd give music ago and it wasn't really
for me I found a job online I found a
job on Twitter for glossybox which is a
beauty box company and I had actually
seen Birchbox and I didn't know there
was one in the UK that wasn't ready at
the time and I thought would be a really
good idea to actually bring once the UK
but the bit naive but I didn't really
have any money so that wasn't gonna
happen but I saw GlossyBox had a job for
intern so I applied for that to find a
future to applied and got the job I
actually started with Zoe from the
London lip gloss which is where we met
which is really cool because that's kind
of how I stuff getting into like going
to blog or events once I met Zoe so I
interned there for three months works
really hard I was mainly doing kind of
PR stuff then at the beginning like
literally there was no one to impure I
was throwing up magazines like little
intern meals quite funny after three
months they took me on full time and I
ended up working there for a year and a
half I got promoted three times ended up
as a marketing manager I did a mix of
everything as a startup company so there
weren't that many people and everyone
kind of got stuck in I was doing PR
social media marketing staff vents was
doing a bit of everything which is
really good because I learned so much
there and really built up my experience
and while this was going on I was
running my blog and recap a bit i
started my blog at uni as part of my
digital
pocketing module they said start a blog
if you like we encourage you to so i did
because i've been reading blogs anyway
for a while so i started my blog this
whole time i was just do my blog as a
hobby but i think halfway through my job
at GlossyBox my blog started becoming
more priority for me and it got to the
point where i wanted to post every day
and i wasn't kind of willing to
sacrifice that so i was waking up at
seven on a saturday in the sunday and
working all evenings during the week
just to kind of get my blog scheduled
and for the week ahead and it just got
to the point where i was starting to
make money for my blog and which I
didn't even know if was like a loud when
i was working at glossybox but I felt
like I had to kind of pick one and I
didn't want I didn't want my job to
suffer i doing with my blog to suffer so
in the end i just took the risk and
decided to leave my job so now i do my
blog and my youtube full time with kind
of odd projects here in there and i
personally think it's a really positive
thing please don't comment on this video
about how bad is and people blog in the
full time job because i just hate seeing
that i think not everyone wants to do is
a great to have a blog as a hobby i had
it as a hobby three years no one even
read my blog for like a year and a half
so it was never ever my intention to do
it full time I didn't even know that
that was possible it's just something
that happened you never know what's
going to happen I don't even know what
I'll be doing like next year but the
moment this kind of seems to be working
for me and i love it i think it's a
really positive thing when people can
turn the hobby into a career blogging
full-time hasn't changed my blog if
anything is made of better because i've
had more time to put into it i have
daily content and i hope you guys have
noticed that is better since of october
november time when i left my job and I
don't think it's negative so please
don't leave any negative comments that
will make me sad yeah so that's what I'm
doing now do I think well side sir but
that I don't think I have anything I
said thought that often that I think
it's a really good thing and I know a
couple of other girls bloggers who also
kind of took the plunge and left their
job to do it it's always going to be a
risk is like starting your own company
but I'm working really hard at the
moment and I have kind of plans for the
future but at the moment I'm just
enjoying doing this I'm obviously not
going to share like my finance details
but if some of your thinking how do you
make
money from a blog or YouTube because
that's kind of the question I get asked
the most even by friends like people
you'd never ask like someone in
marketing how much money they make but
when you're self-employed people seen
say so how much money do you make how do
you make money but um basically you can
get adverts so on youtube you'll see
like before most videos there'll be an
advert and there's certain networks you
can sign up with but give you kind of
better paid ads than google ads and the
same with blogging I'm with glaad media
they just put adverts on my blog and
yeah as I said other bits and pieces
here and there so who are some of my
favorites this is a really hard question
because there are so many first so i'll
put my blog loving link below and you
can look all the blogs that I follow on
bloglovin because I really do check
those every day but I'm going to quickly
read out a list of people that I love
and I'm really sorry if I missed anyone
off and I think some of them are like
obvious ones and that friends of mine
you may see me talking or Twitter I read
their blogs but here are some others a
beautiful mess Caroline hirons Bluebird
vintage by now blog later cupcakes and
cashmere essiebutton gems maquillage
ghost parties hello october lips a fact
oh Jessica French Riviera does makeup
Liana beauty Marian and love cloth
sincerely jules what Olivia did and
zoella and there's those others so look
at my blog laughing link below and this
is a really hard question than something
I get a lot again a lot of people
emailing me saying I just started a blog
and I really want to know how to get
more followers i always reply saying
don't worry about followers as i said
before i don't think anyone read my blog
for a year and a half and but i didn't
really care wasn't really about that i
think your followers will just naturally
grow obviously it's important to get
involved with the community get on
social media like twitter facebook
Instagram all the platforms that you can
and you want to but other than that I
think does let it grow organically I
think focus more on making your blog as
best as it can be and focus on the
content and deciding like what your blog
is and come up with the personality for
your blog and because i personally don't
know like how i got my readers I think I
definitely saw like a big growth when I
started getting more involved and you
know going to blog in events and making
friends with bloggers because when if a
blogger tweets I love
this blog you're going to get followers
from them as well but it's not about
trying to get that I think that just
kind of comes naturally just focus on
making a blog good and people will find
it and they will share it and like it my
best advice for newbie is just what I
said just kind of put everything into it
and focus on the content don't worry
about being like the biggest blogger
around it's not really about that just
focus on creating some good content I
started my blog as i said at uni and i
was told to do it but i've been reading
blogs mainly international vlogs like
star scrapbook and the blonde salad
fashion blogs for a while so um yeah
it's nice to have like a hobby I think
I've never really had I was waiting to
sports but I never had like a hobby I
always wrote diaries when I was younger
which is quite weird because it's kind
of like blogging but yeah I really
should want l have a hobby that I could
come back from uni or work and if I had
a lecturer or a manager at a time what's
doing I've had a crap day you can come
home in your blog is like your own thing
you can manage yourself or I really like
the idea of that the name I hate the
name of my plug and YouTube channel I
named I decided in the name like 10
minutes I had about 10 minutes for
elected to start on it and at the time
it was like in everything blog it wasn't
really just beauty and I thought the
name kind of meant it could be about
anything just what I love today what I
heart today and could be fashion beauty
lifestyle anything really and yeah I
didn't anyone like the limb for their
blog and although i've seen some i love
i wish i could change it but I'm far too
gone now I don't really know I don't
think anyone knows and people always say
like what are you gonna do blogging
might not last forever I'm sure it won't
and I don't see myself being like a
grandma blogger I'm sure it'll turn into
something else I'm very kind of
ambitious and I do have ideas on my head
but I don't really want to talk about
them but i'll probably end up doing
something online i have lots of things
to think about and at the moment i'm
just enjoying what I'm doing really so
that's part one and tune in on wednesday
for part two where are we talking about
personal stuff all these nosy questions
and and beauty and fashion and some
random questions too so thank you for
watching and i hope this has been kind
of interesting see you in the next video
