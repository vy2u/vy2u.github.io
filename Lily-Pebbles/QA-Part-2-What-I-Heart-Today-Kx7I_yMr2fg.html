and hopefully this isn't getting boring
for you I hope you like the last so I
wouldn't have read the comments yet
because clearly I'm just filming the
second one after the first one anyway
I'm gonna get on and the first section
is how many kids do you have and how old
are they well I have three kids one is
five no I don't have any kids I can't
believe someone asked this question if
you see any photos of babies and kids on
my Instagram or wherever it's likely to
be my nieces and nephews I have two
older sisters and they've got three kids
between them I don't have any kids
someone genuinely asked how many kids do
you have and how old that I can't
believe it anyway no i did not have kids
okay this was probably the second most
popular question after what did you
study at uni do you live at home do you
live with rich where do you live
normally I'd kind of brush this question
offer and be like that's too personal
but actually I had to think about it and
I don't really mind telling you I'm not
embarrassed by it although i'm sure the
reaction would be like whoa you crazy
okay so I live with rich my boyfriend at
home with my parents which I'm sure to
most of you is so weird but it's just
not weird for people in London so most
of my friends like blogging friends who
have moved to London from somewhere else
now rent but it's very common if you
live in London have grown up in London
so you still be living at home at 25
most of my friends are the only ones who
aren't to the ones who have lots of
money and people don't really move out
and start renting well where I'm from in
London they don't really they try to
save as much as they can was living at
home so they can buy a place and move
out I think it also depends on the
relationship you have with your parents
my parents are so laid-back and children
we get on really well so it's easy for
me to stay at home rich lives with me
because he isn't from London he's from
Suffolk and he moved on to London after
uni to do in turning like I did and
whilst he was interning he stayed asked
because he needs a somewhere to stay and
then really just got to the point where
we're obviously going to move out
together so I prefer to him to stay here
with me and save his money to them to
waste it on rent so yeah that's our
situation it's kind of weird for 225
years to be living together at home with
my parents but that's just how it is in
London
so expensive rent is so expensive time
saving all my money to buy a nice place
hopefully next year or something like
that me and rich have been together for
five years we met first year at uni we
actually met on the day where you sign
in at uni and mrs. he makes each other
on the table and I didn't have like even
a pen on me which is so typical mean
which had like a whole pencil case so I
just looked over and said and I borrow a
pen please but I think because he looked
at me and saw quite like a tan I just
got back for my gap year tan and curly
hair I think he just like heard Spanish
and for some reason he thought I was
Spanish so when I said can I borrow a
pen he just went kick and I was like
what wanted to say and we just loved by
the story a lot that he thought I was
Spanish but that's when we met and we
didn't move on the same course so we saw
each other and lectures and stuff and
yes blossom from there if I could live
anywhere in the world I would live in
London i absolutely love London I've
grown up here love everything about it I
love all the options there are two where
to go and I really love everything about
it but from the weather if I had to live
somewhere else it being New York because
I really do love New Yorkers wine has a
similar survive to London and but yeah I
love London I for tattoos i did a video
on them so i'll link that below and i
have one piercing just up here and which
people always ask did it hurt didn't
hurt tool and I have a little hoop I got
it done in Camden and I did have my ears
pierced I had like two on that side and
I had the normal ones done they closed
up interesting fact I fainted when i got
my ears pierced at first which was fun i
had my belly button pierced i took that
out what I kind of got past the age of
that looking cool and yeah I i'll eat my
tattoo video below I'm 57 people always
ask how tall I am and I think it's
because I often say I'm quite tall I
don't think 57 is that tool I was always
the tallest in school but then everyone
caught up with me but I do feel
uncomfortable wearing really high heels
I think my legs are quite a bit longer
than my torso so even though 57 is in
that tool when I wear heels i kind of
just looked like a bit of a tree and
people tend to tell me that as well so
don't really wear heels that often ok
well this is a hard question if I could
only buy from one brand um it's
literally impossible but I think it has
to pick nas because they just seem to do
everything well really
their foundations are good the bronzes
give the blushes are good the eyeshadows
are good eyeliners lipsticks you can
definitely get like a whole look from
naz so i'm going to pick us all time
favorite lipstick crap i did not think
of this wonderful and i don't know i
love lipsticks I have so many I don't
actually can't pick like a favorite
lipstick but the Revlon lip butter in
berry smoothie is one I've nearly
finished and I don't think I've ever
finish the lipstick and I wear it all
the time so it's kind of like a lip balm
lipstick I think that's the easiest one
that I seem to wear a lot five basic
makeup pieces everyone should have I
clearly didn't plan this section before
this is really stupid I did a post on
like an introduction to make up which
are linked below which is good for kind
of younger people and it's just about
the makeup that you really need and but
a good concealer I like the Bobby Brown
correct sir origins concealer NARS
Laguna is a really good bronzer and Nas
deep throat is a really good blusher
mascara read Y needs a good mascara I
like unique high impact full volume
mascara and probably the Revlon lip
butter again because it's really easy
versatile it for not to work I think
that'd be a bird I was trying to think
about this one but I was good as a dog
because they don't have to like kill
anything or nothing kills them and they
kind of just have quite a nice life in a
much quite funny like spying on all the
humans but I think a bird because I
really want to fly like seriously if I
had like one way it should be to fly I
just think it looks like so much fun and
yeah I'd love to fly so but not pigeon
there pigeons are gross I hate pigeons
maybe not seagulls either they're really
scary and no i don't really like any
birds i may be like one of those cute
little ones a Robin I'd be a Robin hmm i
don't love sandwiches not a huge
sandwich fan but I like this question so
i think i'd probably go for like crusty
nice baguette with like a parma ham a
bit of salad and a card Oh bit
mayonnaise little bit chicken can you
have parma ham and chicken something i
really like pools they do really nice
like french baguettes yeah
sandwich now so that's everything from
part two hope you found that interesting
think you know everything about me now
but yeah I wanted to answer your
questions so I hope I did them well and
