vlog today and I just fancied having a
week off really so I thought I'd do a
really casual Q&amp;amp;A I'm literally just
sitting on the floor right now and I've
just tweeted asking you guys to tweet me
some questions using the hashtag ask LP
and I said ask me anything so there's
some really good ones and so many random
ones I'm just gonna do like a quick-fire
go through like as many as I can really
and answer some questions for you guys
so I hope you enjoy this what is your
favorite song right now I'm a bit
obsessive Carole King at the moment
because I saw the musical beautiful and
Burberry also used one of her songs as
the opening songs in their fashion show
this year so I've been listening to her
and Spotify will you still love me is
just the best song I can't figure out
who did the cover for Burberry those if
anyone knows please let me know it was
amazing are you and Viviana makeup going
to be doing another beauty chat tour
definitely I would absolutely love to we
haven't got one officially planned yet
but we definitely want to do some more
we're hoping to maybe do one in LA when
we come at the end of July I really want
to go to Germany because you both have
such a huge audience in Germany it
literally goes UK u.s. Germany which is
amazing and we've never really been
there properly so we definitely want to
try do Germany and we are up for going
anywhere really we are trying to plan
some more beach at tours because that
would be so much fun what made you think
beauty blogging is what I want to be and
why love your channel thank you it
wasn't a thought process I just started
a beauty blog as part of my uni course
got really into it enjoyed it as a hobby
for a few years and then a couple years
ago it just became a full-time job
naturally that it was never a plan it
just took up more and more of my time I
started earning a bit of money out of
advertising on my blog and I thought why
not just give it a go and that's just
kind of how it's happened there was
absolutely no plan if you didn't live in
London where would you want to live
instead I really can't imagine myself
living anywhere but London I love it
here I am the most prolonged iner ever
but I also really like New York is not
that different to London and I really
like the vibe there and I love that
there's still so many restaurants and
like new places to try which is what I
love doing so I can imagine living in
New York where in the world would you
most like to visit and where do you want
to go back to I'd love to go back to
Thailand always but I've been there
quite a few times now so I feel guilty
going back and not trying somewhere new
I haven't really done South America yet
so I'd really like to do that
and I'd also really like to do more of
America I've obviously done like LA New
York all the obvious ones but I'd like
to get car and just kind of drive
through America my parents have done
that and they absolutely loved it could
I use just one camera for both sit-down
videos and daily vlogging if so which
one would you recommend the cameras I
use probably not I have a canon 600d
which I'm filming on now and that's a
bit big for vlogging and my vlogging
camera the Canon s 20 is probably a bit
small and there isn't a flip round
screen which you can't really film main
videos on him there is a new Canon gx7 I
think it's called up at the link below
which everyone seems to have and it's
got a flip over screen it's amazing
quality so I reckon that camera you
could probably use for both I don't have
it though so I can't recommend it but it
looks great do you think there's still a
place for new bloggers youtubers it's 27
to old to start twenty sevens not old
that's all how old I am gosh I
definitely think there's always room
everyone has a different voice a unique
way of writing or speaking and hidden
there's always room for more
I don't read one blog or watch one
YouTube channel I read and watch
hundreds so definitely give it a go if
anything I think you're more sure of
yourself when you're 27 and it's
probably easier to know what you want to
say then when I started I was like 19 so
yeah give it a go I know which political
party will you be voting for the general
election next month I'm actually not
sure yet I don't really talk about
politics and stuff on here because it
just causes too much like I grow but um
I do feel quite passionate about people
voting I think it is really important to
vote even if you don't want to vote for
any party like go in and write no vote
and I just think you can't really
complain if you haven't voted but it is
very hard to decide who to vote for it's
just a bit of a mess really I've been
watching the debates and reading up on
it I haven't quite decided yet but I
will definitely be voting tell us
something we don't know about you when I
was little I used to call my bottle what
should I have my milk or juice or
whatever out or they used to call it
Aggie I think it's because I couldn't
say give me so I just said ghee so I
just said like ghee I want my key and I
had my bottle for quite a long time as
well nice drinks cold tea out of it my
mom used to make tea let it cool down
and put it in my bottle how weird as
well if you could be any superhero who
would it be I don't actually know
superheroes I probably shouldn't have
done this question but I think I'd like
to be able to
go invisible whenever I like I was gonna
say fly I'd like to know what it feels
like to fly but actually I can imagine
it been quite scary I think being
invisible like when whenever you want it
just like things that would be pretty
cool favorite mascara at the moment I'm
looking to buy a new one I'm really
enjoying the Max Factor glammo
extensions three-in-one I think it's
called
I will link it down below but I'm really
enjoying it at the moment I'm wearing it
today it's very easy and gives nice link
nice creamy concealer or Urban Decay
Naked concealer oh I think I'm gonna
have to sit up and decay I'm just loving
it at the moment
sorry NARS that was my favorite for a
long time but I have moved on what is
your worst pet hate that rich does uh he
worked in a big office so he picks up a
lot of office lingo and he says he often
says like these sayings oh my god I
can't stand like sayings he will say at
the end of the day or I can't think of
any other now but they really annoy me
and I always say to him stop saying
Sainz just speak just say words you know
half that I feel like it's a lazy way of
talking so he picks up a lot of office
chat and that's quite annoying what is
your favorite topping to have on
pancakes really really thin streaky
crispy bacon with loads of maple syrup
how do you feel about squirrels no I
don't I don't they're bit creepy they
run too fast and the ones in London are
really mangy and gross and yucky I think
red squirrels are probably nice but we
don't really get those we get the gray
ones they killed all the red ones
favorite healthy meals I love this big
red and white quinoa salad thing that I
make quite often I'll put the recipe
below it's so easy you don't have to
cook anything but the quinoa everything
that goes in is just war ingredients and
it's delicious it makes the best salad
to go with anything I often eat it just
by itself and it's so so healthy and so
easy to make if you're not that good at
cooking favorite food that's really
really hard I think I have to say sushi
I just I love love sushi and pasta what
are your top three pet peeves I can't
stand shushing you know when you're like
in a library and someone goes Shh I just
spot I actually just spot I can't stand
shushing it that noise really annoys me
most of my pet peeves and noise related
I can't stand leaf blowers what is the
point of them they're just moving leaves
around and making a noise also hate the
sound of motorbikes or they like rev up
and go really like aggravates me
makes me feel really angry I also can't
stand when you're talking to someone and
they're not looking you in the eye they
kind of like looking you but like
looking for someone else more
interesting to talk to I find that so
rude will you ever come to Australia I
love Australia I spent loads of time
there my gap year and I went on holiday
when I was about 15 I really really love
it there I would definitely love to come
how cool if me and Anna came to
Australia for a beauty chat live someone
please make that happen if you could be
friends with any celebrity who would it
be
I follow Taylor Swift on Instagram and I
was never a Taylor Swift fan before when
she used to be a country singer I just
didn't get it I found her a little bit
annoying but recently I just think she
looks like so cool she looks like the
sort of girl you want to hang out with
like get someone with guys and up for a
laugh doesn't embarrass easily and I
just think she'd be really fun to hang
out with if you could travel back or
forwards in time what would you do see
what would you want to do we'll see I
would like to go out and spend the day
with both of my grandpa's cuz neither of
them are alive anymore one of them died
when I was five so I really didn't get
to know him and I think how nice would
that be to spend the day both of my
grandpa's would love to do that favorite
pizza topping pepperoni and mushroom
sometimes with a bit of artichoke if you
could have dinner with a celebrity dead
or alive who would it be and why oh my
god is that a leaf blower I told you
this is so annoying if you could have a
dinner with the celebrity dead or alive
who would it be and why probably Stevie
Wonder I don't think he's meant to be
the nicest guy ever but he's probably
got some great stories and he'll be up
for a laugh any advice on having spray
tans no because I've never had one I
think they look like the scariest thing
in the world and I don't really want to
stand there naked in front of a stranger
holding on to my boobs that just sounds
so awkward what nail varnish describes
the spring for you se-min candy apple
definitely always mint blue I love it
favourite Grey's Anatomy character past
or present
George Oh George that whole like George
and Katherine Heigl can't remember her
name in the actual program that
storyline just I will never forget it
really got to me first thing you would
do if you were a boy go and do we that's
it that's all the questions I think I
got through quite a lot there and
actually they're quite funny around him
one so thank you to everyone who tweeted
me a question and I hope you don't mind
that there wasn't a vlog this week but
I'll definitely be vlogging again for
next Tuesday and I have
another video coming up on Thursday and
Sunday just like always so thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you guys
on Thursday bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
