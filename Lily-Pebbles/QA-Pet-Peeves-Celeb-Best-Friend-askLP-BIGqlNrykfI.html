vlog today I just fancied having a week
off really so I thought I'd do a really
casual QA I'm literally just sitting on
the floor right now and I've just
tweeted asking you guys to tweet me some
questions using the hashtag ask LP and I
said ask me anything so there's some
really good ones and so many random ones
I'm just gonna do like a quick-fire go
through like as many as I can really and
answer some questions for you guys so I
hope you enjoy this what is your
favorite song right now I'm a bit
obsessive Carole King at the moment
because i saw the musical beautiful and
burberry also used one of her songs as
the opening songs in their fashion show
this year so I've been listening to her
and Spotify will you still love me is
just the best song I can't figure out
who did the cover for burberry those if
anyone knows please let me know it was
amazing are you and viviana makeup going
to be doing another beauty chat tool
definitely I would absolutely love to we
haven't got one officially planned yet
but we definitely want to do some more
we're hoping to maybe do one in LA when
we come at the end of july i really want
to go to Germany because you both have
such a huge audience in Germany it
literally goes UK u.s. Germany which is
amazing and we've never really been
there properly so we definitely want to
try to Germany and we are up for going
anywhere really we are trying to plan
some all these chapters because that
would be so much fun what made you think
beauty blogger is what I want to be and
why love your channel thank you it
wasn't a thought process I just started
a beauty blog as part of my uni course
got really into it enjoyed it as a hobby
for a few years and then a couple years
ago it just became a full-time job
naturally that it was never a plan it
just took up more and more of my time I
started I need a bit of money out of
advertising on my blog and I thought why
not just give it a go and that's just
kind of how it's happened there was
absolutely no plan if you didn't live in
London where would you want to live
instead I really can't imagine myself
living anywhere but London I love it
here i am the most pro Londoner ever but
I also really like New York is not that
different to London and I really like
the vibe there and I love that there's
still so many restaurants and like new
places to try which is what I love doing
so i can imagine living in New York
where in the world would you most like
to visit and where do you want to go
back to I'd love to go back to Thailand
always but I've been there quite a few
times now so I feel guilty going back
and not trying somewhere new I haven't
really done South America yet so I'd
really like to do that and
also really like to do more of America
I've obviously done like la New York all
the obvious ones but i'd like to get car
and just kind of drive through american
my parents have done that and they
absolutely loved it could i use just one
camera for both sit down videos and
daily vlogging if so which one would you
recommend the cameras i use probably not
i have a canon 600d which i'm filming on
now and that's a bit big for vlogging
and my vlogging camera the canon s20 is
probably a bit small and there isn't a
flip around screen which you can't
really film main videos on it there is a
new canon gx7 i think it's called up at
the link below which everyone seems to
have and it's got a flip over screen
it's amazing quality so i reckon that
camera you could probably use for both I
don't have it though so I can't
recommend it but it looks great do you
think there's still a place for new
bloggers youtubers it's 27 too old to
start 27 is not old that's all how old I
am gosh I definitely think there's
always room everyone has a different
voice a unique way of writing or
speaking and hidden is always room for
more I don't read one blog or watch one
YouTube channel I read and watch
hundreds so definitely give it a go if
anything I think you're more sure of
yourself when you're 27 and it's
probably easier to know what you want to
say then when I started I was like 19 so
yeah give it a go why not which
political party will you be voting for
the general election next month I'm
actually not sure yet I don't really
talk about politics and stuff on here
because it just causes too much like I
grow but um I do for quite passionate
about people voting i think it is really
important to vote even if you don't want
to vote for any party like go in and
write no vote and i just think you can't
really complain if you haven't voted but
it is very hard to decide who to vote
for it's just a bit of a mess really
i've been watching the debates and
reading up on it haven't quite decided
yet but i will definitely be voting tell
us something we don't know about you
when I was little I used to call my
bottle which I have my milk or juice or
whatever out over used to call it Aggie
I think it's because I couldn't say give
me so I just said ghee so I just said
like key I want my key and I had my
bottle for quite a long time as well he
streaked cold tea out of it my mom is to
make tea let it cool down and put it in
my bottle how weird is that if you could
be any superhero who would it be I don't
actually know superheroes I probably
shouldn't have done this question but I
think I'd like to be able to go in
visible whenever I like I was gonna say
fly I'd like to know what it feels like
to fly back see i can imagine it'd be
quite scary i think being invisible like
when whenever you want it just like
thing that would be pretty cool favorite
mascara at the moment i'm looking to buy
a new one i'm really enjoying the max
factor glammo extensions three in one I
think it's called i will link it down
below but i'm really enjoying it at the
moment i'm wearing today so easy and
gives nice link NARS creamy concealer or
urban decay naked concealer oh I think
I'm gonna have to say oven decay I'm
just loving it at the moment sorry nas
that was my favorite for a long time but
I have moved on what is your worst pet
hate that rich does uh he worked in a
big office so he picks up a lot of
office lingo and he says he often says
like these sayings oh my god i can't
stand like Saenz will say at the end of
the day or I can't think of any other
now but they really annoyed me and I
always say to him stop saying sayings
just speak just say words you don't have
to i feel like it's a lazy way of
talking so he picks up a lot of office
chat and that's quite annoying what is
your favorite topping to have on
pancakes really really thin streaky
crispy bacon with loads of maple syrup
how do you feel about squirrels no i
don't i don't there bit creepy they to
run too fast and the ones in London are
really mangy and gross and yucky I think
red squirrels are probably nice but we
don't really get those we get grey ones
they killed all the red ones favorite
healthy meals I love this big red and
white quinoa salad thing that I make
quite often I put the recipe below it's
so easy you don't have to cook anything
but the quinoa everything that goes in
is just war ingredients and it's
delicious it makes the best salad to go
with anything I often eat it just by
itself and it's so so healthy I'm so
easy to make if you're not that good at
cooking favorite food that's really
really hard I think I have to say sushi
I just I love love sushi and pasta what
are your top three pet peeves I can't
stand shushing you know when you're like
in a library and someone goes Shh I just
spot I actually just spot I can't stand
shushing it that noise really annoys me
most of my pet peeves and noise related
i can't stand leaf blowers what is the
point of them they're just moving leaves
around and making a noise i also hate
the sound of motorbikes where they like
rev up and go really like aggravates
it makes me feel really angry I also
can't stand when you're talking to
someone and they're not looking you in
the eye they kind of like looking you
but like looking for someone else more
interesting to talk to I find that so
rude will you ever come to Australia I
love Australia I spent loads of time
there my gap year and I went on holiday
when I was about 15 I really really love
it there I would definitely love to come
how cool if me and Anna came to
Australia for a beauty chat live someone
please make that happen if you could be
friends with any celebrity who would it
be I follow taylor swift on instagram
and i was never a Taylor Swift fan
before when she used to be a country
singer I just didn't get it I found her
a little bit annoying but recently I
just think she looks like so cool she
looks like the sort of girl you want to
hang out with like get someone with guys
and up for a laugh doesn't embarrass
easily and i just think she'd be really
fun to hang out with if you could travel
back or forwards in time what would you
do see what would you want to do we'll
see i would like to go out and spend the
day with both of my grandpa's because
neither of them are alive anymore one of
them died when I was five so I really
didn't get to know him and I think how
nice would that be to spend the day both
of my grandpas I would love to do that
favorite pizza topping pepperoni and
mushroom sometimes with a bit of
artichoke if you could have dinner with
a celebrity dead or alive who would it
be and why oh my god is that a leaf
blower told you this so annoying if you
could have a dinner with celebrity dead
or alive who would it be and why
probably Stevie Wonder I don't think
he's meant to be the nicest guy ever but
I think he's probably got some great
stories and he'll be up for a laugh any
advice on having spray tans know because
I've never had one I think they look
like the scariest thing in the world and
I don't really want to stand there naked
in front of a stranger holding on to my
boobs that just sounds so awkward what
nail varnish describes spring for you SE
mint candy apple definitely always mint
blue I love it favorite Grey's Anatomy
character past or present George on
George that whole like George and
Katherine Heigl can't member her name in
the actual program that storyline just I
will never forget it really got to me
first thing you would do if you were a
boy oh go and do we that's it that's all
the questions I think I got through
quite a lot there and actually they're
quite funny random one so thank you to
everyone who tweeted me a question and I
hope you don't mind that there wasn't a
vlog this week but I'll definitely be
vlogging again for next Tuesday and I
have
another video coming up on Thursday and
Sunday just like always so thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you guys
on Thursday bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
