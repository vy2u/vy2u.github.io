a substitute to a vlog but vlogs will

tripod up I'm gonna do on a proper
camera just because it's easier than
holding this one okay rich is gettin in
place I'm just gonna take the card out
of here
and this one and put it in here okay we
have kids like in the house making loads
of noise but I just screenshot some
questions so let's just go through them
talk loud enough so they can hear in the
questionnaire in focus
no I haven't like hopefully read them
okay team Jim oh I can't pronounce
people's names didn't do mild Emile
asked describe each other in three ways
three words I guess she means let me get
first kind what you describe me yeah not
describe myself and having you kind kind
genuine kind genuine and funny thanks me
I would say lily is thoughtful
spontaneous and intuitive can that be a
one I don't know my feet stink
they do sting I've been wearing my
Topshop slip-on shoes and they make my
feet stink I wouldn't touch him oh yes
you just pick it up that's my hand oh so

been yeah wait what no what auntie kind
of all he lives there
yep and got nice way I went you together
we me and my my best mate and I went
there 2006
just before we went travelling around
Australia so we stopped off in Singapore
for five four or five days and went
Australia and then Tokyo I've never been
Singapore but I would like to you one
day Joycelyn Joycelyn said when you were
kids
what did each of you want to be when you
grew up oh my god
I think it was a policeman that's all
like a spy goodbye yeah how's it spy
went from policeman to become a spy I
still want to be a spy mi5 hook him up I
wanted to be a pop star I wanted to be a
singer definitely always I loved singing
okay Sammy asked are you planning on
having children and if so how many do
you want
and boys or girls ten children six boys
four girls have won them before we're 35
no Suzy we both come from a family of
like three kids so that feels normal I
think to both of us you know I don't
want to I'm not pushing the three babies
out of there bloody hell I feel like -
maybe I could deal with but I'm like not
some of my friends are like I can't wait
to be pregnant have babies I am a
petrified I have older sisters who have
just put me off I'm so scared of that
day where I have to give birth and so I
don't know but I definitely want a girl
first I feel like I've seen what little
boys are like hi footsteps I've seen
what little boys are like and I've seen
what little girls are like and when
they're little girls are easier and I
think for my first one I'd like a girl
you first one boy see who wins I'm the
older brother
yeah I get that okay Charlotte asked top
restaurant in London
yeah good one I like duck I'm awful yeah
there's pointy places I've got better
food more variety but duck and waffle
really push that they do really cool
such simple things they make it really
sort of BAM was it like not experimental
yeah just cool and like it's amazing
view as well yeah Ellie how old were you
when you met each other 29 19 2007 so 19
yeah 19 just after a gap year first year
uni and we're now both 27 you know Zoey
hi Zoey
I know Zoey how did you find the
transition from uni to work I'm in my
last week
Yuni so any advice would be great I kind
of I was ready to get in stuck in yeah
we were both quite eager to start
working but it is it's it's exciting and
it's fun
but it's quite hard to transition from
being a student and having like free
time and yeah you know going at your own
pace and stuff to working I personally
loved it didn't find it that hard to get
into it I was excited to be working yes
I have any like tips yeah just don't
wait too long a lot my friends took like
a year out after uni and I think that
makes it harder to settle down I do miss
this internship more experienced just
gal that yeah
mix up Emma if you both had supplied
each other the perfect day out what
would it be okay let me do you first we
would wake up and have like a huge
brunch like brunch with like maybe like
a bottomless kind of boozy brunch yeah
Deb simple head with like champagne and
drinks and stuff and then go for like a
really nice walk maybe do like Go Ape
which is like outdoor thing when you
like is this a story nice for me yeah
I'm planning to go down for you you like
swing from trees and like do activities
maybe go for like an indoor ski slope or
something and then go somewhere really
cool like duck and waffle for like an
early dinner or you can I see the Sun
sets yeah and then maybe do go to like a
cool like cinema like maybe like a 3d
cinema and watch some sort of like scary
film with actually shouldn't static pop
Jurassic pop in 3d and then men I'm some
kind of like midnight walk over like the
bridges in London or something or
midnight marathon a midnight marathon
all right what would you play for me
this is hard
so again oh do you like brunch you're a
brunch person so we do a really nice
brunch pancakes American sort of crispy
bacon pancake thing then probably go do
like a walk slash picnic then go you'd
like a massage then go for like a long
massage spa place then say afternoon tea

the time okay Sarah asked who's the good
cop and who's the bad cop oh my god wait

pretty obvious
good cop bad cop always everyone loves
rich it was like if I turn up and like
to my knees

super bad girl said London looks lovely
but I'd imagine it can be chaotic what
are the best and worst things about
living there right anyways I've always
lived here and I'm very Pro London bu
from the good old countryside and
usually like you can't this one what are
the best and worst things about living
in here obviously the worst things is
the chaoticness tourism tourists don't I
am I get we mean like it when you're
when you're when you live in London like
walking down a busy street when a
tourist like stops to look at map it
drives you mad yeah no I don't hate
tourists but I mean yeah I hate it when
this just like especially on bought
these bikes as well yeah what so that's
kind of my pet hey the tubes can you use
the cheap is a good thing yeah get
around quickly well I do like about this
just is and I can't I I actually find it
frustrating I can't keep up with it is
the new things happening every weekend
every day long there's new things
popping up new restaurants new bars new
clubs new shops just new things to do
festivals there's always the literary
sense of it you just you can't keep up
with it yeah so that's kind of a good or
bad yeah oh and then the next pictures
