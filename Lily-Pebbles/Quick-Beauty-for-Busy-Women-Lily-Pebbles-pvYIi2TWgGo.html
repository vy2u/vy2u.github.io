talking about quick busine now this can
apply to quite a few different people
not just for mummies who obviously have
very little time for themselves in the
morning but also for working girls if
you have a job and you haven't got that
much time in the morning to get ready
for going to work or if you're someone
who likes to iron or often sleeps
through their alarm a lot of us are very
busy and we don't have time to spend 25
minutes on our makeup take a long warm
shower in the morning and do a full
skincare routine so in this video I'm
going to be talking through a few
different products that will just make
your routine that a little bit quicker
multi-use products that are really handy
so I'm gonna get started so you wake up
and rush to the shower and the first
product I would really recommend is from
Loxy tan and it's their almond shower
oil this is great because it's so
multi-use you can use it to wash
yourself you can use it as a shaving gel
and also really moisturize your skin so
there's no need for body moisturizer
when you get out of the shower
it smells delicious it lasts a really
long time because you only need a tiny
amount and it's just really good
products worth investing in if you're a
morning hair washer I definitely am not
because it would take hours to do my
hair but a lot of people like to wash
their hair in the morning and one
product I would really recommend I
couldn't actually get my hands on I
couldn't find it anywhere annoyingly but
it's the ocean cleansing conditioner
that's part of this new like co-washing
thing where you basically just use a
conditioner to wash your hair especially
if you're the sort of person to wash
your hair everyday you don't need to use
a stripping shampoo these sort of
cleansing conditioners are perfect they
clean your hair but they also leave it
moisturized
I also spotted this in Boots which is
the naked detox two-in-one shampoo and
conditioner I haven't had time to try it
yet because I was trying to find the
ozone one but something like this where
it's a two in one or it's just a
cleansing conditioner really cuts down
the time that you have to wash your hair
and it's just not necessary to use a
shampoo and conditioner every day when
you get out the shower use something
like this this is the wet brush and this
is amazing scout tangles in your hair
really quickly you just swipe it through
your hair no need to sit there for ages
getting out the knots this is super
quick and easy to use I wouldn't
normally recommend washing your face in
the shower because the water you use it
is quite a lot hotter than water you
would use in your sink and it's not
great for your skin but when you finish
doing your hair and you finish showering
and getting clean turn your water
slightly cooler and then use something
like this which is the Liz Earle cleanse
and polish this is just a really gentle
creamy cleanser that works for all skin
types you just need one pump well but
all over your face wash it off in water
that isn't too hot kind of warm water
and your skin will feel fresh and ready
for the day there's absolutely no need
to do a whole skin care routine every
morning it's so fine to miss out on that
every now and again I definitely do so
the one product I would really recommend
though that kind of does it all is the
Sarah Chapman morning facial and I love
this because it's like a serum oil and
moisturizer all in one you just need one
pump maybe two at most and it completely
moisturizes your skin it makes it feel
plump it's not too oily at all so don't
worry if you have oily skin it just
really Prime's the skin ready for makeup
and it makes your skin feel great all
day so now on to makeup and although I
like to take 2025 minutes at the weekend
to do my makeup on a weekday if I am in
a rush a three-minute makeup routine is
perfect I know a lot of you guys don't
like to wear loads of heavy makeup so
this sort of simple routine is perfect
I'm literally using six products a
tinted moisturizer a concealer a cream
blush cream eye shadow mascara and a lip
balm all the products I use will be
listed below in the description box and
I'm going to set the timer now for three
minutes so let's see if I do the whole
routine in time I'm going to start with
the tinted moisturizer and just put that
all over the face this is the jouer
matte and Wistar moisture tint and this
is really good I like to use a buffing
brush just to blend that in you can use
your hands but I actually find a brush
is much quicker this is a slightly matte
I find that it lasts longer than most
tinted moisturizers but it still has
that quite sheer natural finish
then I'm going to use my NARS concealer
and just put that under my eyes and
anywhere on the face that needs it and
again use a brush to blend it in because
I find that it's quicker and it gives a
nice natural finish as well for a bit of
color I'm going to use the Clinique
cream blushes in stick forms that's
really easy put on your cheeks like that
again I find a brush it's much quicker
to blend then fingers but you can use
either just putting that up onto the
cheekbones for a nice flush of color
something on my eyes a Kiko cream
eyeshadow I'm just a really easy bronze
and then for this one I am using my
finger because I find that quicker on
the eyes taking that underneath as well
and then a bit of mascara because that
always makes you look more awake this
Tarte one hardly requires any effort
it's like instant lift and then just for
something on the lips my Clarins instant
lip Perfector is kind of just like a
tinted balm and it's really pretty on
the lips quick and easy that's it with
30 seconds to spare
yes so your makeups done and you're
ready to leave the house but one thing I
would recommend is having a ready-made
beauty essentials bag already in your
handbag because then if you do have
spare time throughout the day whether
you're sitting at your desk waiting for
an email to send or you're waiting to
pick up your kid from school you can
reach this bag and top up your makeup or
do whatever you need to do because it
will all be in here so I'm gonna run
through what's in my little essentials
bag obviously you can cater this to
whatever you're gonna need throughout
the day
I hope you guys found this helpful and
hopefully you'll help you cut down your
PC routine in the morning and make
things super quick when you don't have
that much time to get ready if you like
this video please give it a thumbs up
and looking forward to seeing you guys
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
