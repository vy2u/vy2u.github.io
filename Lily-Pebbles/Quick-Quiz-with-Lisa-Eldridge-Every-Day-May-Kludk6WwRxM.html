of a fail so far because I've just
deleted all the clips that I filmed this
morning so we're back to square one but
it's fine we can start again because I
was pretty mone this morning anyway I
woke up with the most horrific headache
and Anna came and gave me some nurofen
and then we went down for breakfast so
I'm starting to feel a little bit better
now but I'm just I never I never get
headaches so when I do I just don't have
to deal with it and I'm not used to it
at all and it's really like in your face
headaches so struggling a bit this
morning and we had to delay filming our
beauty chat video because I just really
wasn't up for it so we're gonna have to
do that next week sometime but Anna
filmed a video so that's good I'm just
getting ready I did my hair and that's
doing my makeup and we have like loads
of free time we are meeting Lisa
Eldridge later this afternoon but until
then we have nothing to do so I'm going
to get ready I'm uploading yesterday's
vlog I did it last night in bed and the
Wi-Fi here is so bad that it's literally
on 83% and I started uploading it last
night at 11:30 p.m. it's now close to
11:00 has been nearly 12 hours it's
crazy I really hope that finishes before
we leave the hotel I think we're gonna
go find the nearest MAC store because a
lot of you guys tweeted me to say that
you found your Mac's or lip pencil in
Paris so I'm going to go have a go see
if they have those here and we might
just have a little wonder around Paris
hopefully this headache will go away
it's driving me mad I'm gonna go and do
my makeup
during your makeup in front of natural
light is key especially when Lisa
Eldridge is going to be up in your face
looking at your makeup close-up I'm so
in love with this bronzer from Too Faced
is there milk chocolate one it's like
the perfect light bronzer you see the
difference I've done this side and I
haven't done this side as in if you can
see but it's just a really nice kind of
subtle bronze I love it as Matt okay
makeup done popping lips desperate times
call for desperate measures I'm leaving
to my laptop because this thing is so
temperamental if you move it a tiny bit
it disconnects this whole thing fail so
I'm really hoping they don't come and
clean my room and move this maybe I'll
put something on the door actually
paranoid 85 percent 85 but it's gonna
happen before 3 o'clock ok I've just
caught up on most of my emails then a
bit of work not feeling positive about
this upload it's on 89% look like
nothing I don't really if it doesn't
upload then I'll have to just upload it
when I get home but it won't be 6:30
just annoying because I like to do
things if I say I'm uploading it every
day so it's busy I have to upload every
day 6:30 so let's see it's so nearly
there come on eleven percent you can do
this 15 minutes so we're going out so
I'm just going to pack up a bag I've
just been snapchatting away and now I'm
gonna go upstairs and meet everyone in
the lobby
you
we found Mack it is obviously collect
which is that shop we went to last
summer here and loved it it is I'm gonna
go see if they have saw they're sold out
obviously that top one is sought and
then one below as well so I like source
bit more pink flamingo even is that why
I never see yeah I'm gonna get a mini
fixed class and then I'm going to get
this one which is mayor as I can match
peach blossom which is like a light pink
and then dark side which is a really
nice dark lipstick it's fat to get in a
few MAC lipsticks which shreds them on
my hand and yeah these are all the big
samples obviously the testers mini SME
ones they didn't have saw and they
didn't have man but I got peach blossom
sorry and dark side we're gonna cross
the road ago to collect now show Cheryl

euros and you don't know what's inside
so my tears when I was when I was
younger used to go to France you get it

long-term store because we saw one
earlier we didn't know that it was like
a standalone stores I'm gonna go look
inside

have lunch
someone called Bread and Roses which the
lady in the longtime shop recommended
Patsy salad this is Anna's new phone

last ones she'd seen after like two
solid days of interviews and workshops
