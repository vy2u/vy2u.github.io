I'm with Anna hello we're in New York
it's our final day and I thought it
would be nice just do a really chilled
video I've never done like a real time
get ready with me which is like w GG o
WM not ow it's 9:30 in the morning
seriously but like no editing as little
as I can just us putting our makeup on
because we're genuinely putting our
makeup on to get ready for the day
there's nothing interesting but we go
chat yeah exactly
how are you I'm having a good day no
seriously I'm gonna get started because
it's probably well well yeah well it's
our final day of New York we call hit
Monday night yeah like Monday evening
we've been here Bobby Brown and we've
had a couple of days on our own and it's
been really nice it's being really nice
New York is like our new place that we
come to you quite locked in which makes
you feel well found and it's so nice
when you go somewhere quite often
because then you get here and you like
don't like this trip we literally
haven't left Soho like one yeah
interpret Oakland but but normally when
you come to new you feel like you have
to go to these places where just be
really chilled which I really like and
we felt it kind of know our way around
and like this is the way home oh no no
was it please can we not talk about how
the color I've got on my face just
really doesn't match it's really dark
for me oh god I don't even know if mine
does I'm using there and it cosmetics
this thing we went to Sephora yesterday
even haul on my channel
coming up and and they gave out a free
one I kind of why they were giving out
giving out with it I gave it to me did
their guinea brained
yeah lady was like excuse me that's like
my favorite foundation ever they were
with Lily's Frankie sure and they were
saying like oh it's a it's a color
corrector and I wouldn't have what the
hell it wasn't and I looked I was like
Keesha it's like the best foundation
ever oh your love it I also bought so I
bought a travel size and then they gave
out it's like many many many one
literally very tiny size so type I feel
like it would be a good one for like
overnight stays yeah you're not wearing
a lot of makeup yeah it's just the best
what's the point in trying anything else
although saying that we got to try a new
Bobby Brown foundation on this trip
that's like a secret and we're not as
talked about it earlier whoa we're not
saying
make of the room the same what it is but
it actually was really nice it was
really nice coming out in like the New
Year or something yeah I think so it was
yeah oh god I don't say anything about
it this is what happens I'm finding you
Foundation I'm like oh that's so nice
and then before you know I'm back to it
it's just something about it I don't
know what it is but to me nothing else
compares yeah it makes me look like kind
of glowy health coverage
I'm the winter gang tick spot young does
it come out yeah and it came out last
night I did the good I did bigger thing
and I stopped they would like a hot
flannel on it and then it went and like
last night in the bathroom yeah yeah in
front oh my god I see that and then I
gave it a good squeeze and it was
honestly one of those ones it was like
oh like you know you squeeze and it pops
and it's it's like from the film oh man
it was it was really good thing that's a
guy can we just talk about the guy out
there that's just hanging out his window
is he okay
she's catch his eye
maybe you're trying to find someone on
the ground
Oh bollocks I just went like that on a
white okay we're okay we're okay there's
nothing on it no this is foundation I
just put it down into the booth where
they I'm trying to be really careful
because I got a piercing yesterday I got
in early like that I don't even know
where that part of my ear is called like
a bit at the cartilage Don and I'm
wearing my hair down today keeps
brushing it and like I was really not
prepared for it Lily was I was sitting
downstairs because I don't like that
kind of and then Lily was like oh
hey is it this is safe up here I thought
you were gonna say no why do you like
okay I was like okay that's cool I just
started like profusely sweating and then
Lily's like if you could just film it
from me on my own that'd be great that
I'm like there but I've only ever like I
don't only have my ears pierced once and
that was at Claire's accessories where
they like do it with the gun and like
County down but this guy I just wasn't
there for it like she had like a wad
Lily's like they put this like kind of
rotted through and then they put the
needle through and then they put the
earring in so it's like a three-part
thing we're even her I think you could
do it I know you and it didn't hurt if I
miss it's just like a lot of pressure he
made me feel like it was gonna kill cuz
he was like you need to take three deep
breaths breathe in breathe out I was
like I didn't even feel it
it just looked intense like I just said
he wasn't prepared for it like he kind
of stood away and then there was Lucy
like a piece of metal through here I was
like oh okay that's baby so well done I
didn't fight you didn't faint I'm so
pleased she finally got a bloody
piercing because every time you come
here you're like oh let's go to the
piercing shop we go but she never gets
it done and this time I'm like that and
your sunglasses oh my god best like
we've had such a productive two weeks
when Lily bought her sunglasses INSCOM
she was like this is I'm done I was I
going on why all the sunglasses she's
obsessed
so we Menke shipping like testing her
and every time she looks past the
sunglasses shut we're like really but to
be fair you actually you've passed the
test I have I have can I just say I'm
using the new YSL concealer it's the all
ours concealer and I really like it and
it's probably the first liquid concealer
in a while that I haven't felt like I
have to go
in with like the NARS one afterwards my
dark circles it's got like that much
coverage because you like quite a lot of
coverage that looks a bit like the NARS
one but I find that a bit drying yeah
but not if I think about it though like
back in the day I never used to find it
drying at all and this when I use it
yeah I feel like it gets a bit creepy
especially like in that it's a bit like
urban decay one which I really like I
just forget exists because the colors a
little bit too warm for me this one's a
bit more like yellow oh yeah naked what
happened to that I still use it I think
just used it up and never repurchase it
I'm super into the NARS like pot bond
this one like not the creamy concealer
do they sell the soften that complete
concealer which sounds horrifying like
that that name doesn't might turn me on
to it at all that actually is really
good it's got like decent coverage I
bought I bought the new glossy a powder
and with it if you want you can buy us
like a kit with the brush and loads of
people said the brush is really bad I
thought yeah maybe it's bad for powder
but it's a really good like travel
bronzer brush it's a bit like it's weird
how it's like flat a bit contour yeah I
kind of want to like squish it and I'm
gonna use it for once it wasn't much
more it was like what seven dollars more
or something I just love like mini
brushes let's just take a moment for
this as well oh my god it's gonna be
like a cotton buds holder I can feel it
like the Toulouse cotton buds
yeah like bits it's for your like you
know you put in your handbag and you
wrap it all around just yeah like my
imodium pills and stuff
perfect lovely I did the same thing and
I bought it as well and I also bought
the brush but don't know where it is I'm
just gonna use Bobby Brown cher powder
which I've been using for all power so
that strikes this is under my like I
love that brush but look how long is I
can't travel with that is really big but
I kind of use it for everything I think
it's got like bronzer on from yesterday
I'm not crazy into powdering but here
the weather has been like downright
bizarre it's been like a bit windy but
then so hot like we're feeling like we
were melting you're the first day oh my
god it is so hot yeah we were like
really not mentally prepared for that
I'm also am I trying not to put too much
makeup on because we're actually flying
home today so it's a bit silly really
oh yeah I need to put
cleanse or something in my hand luggage
I think I can any cover me look I'm just
useless I've got a mini Bioderma I have
like maybe we should go buy some like
face wipes oh I bought some remember in
the airport on the way out
Caroline no finalist flights and
festivals there you go
justified this is also they used this on
me yesterday subsystems probably brown
pink glow highlighter I think they use
the pink one she told me she's she put
the highlighter on under my blusher and
I thought I was genius she said it gives
a lit from within look I'm kind of
obsessed with this the Marc Jacobs gonna
make a brother is the longest name ever
I will make a bronze coconut perfect tan
limited edition in 104 tantastic oh come
on
ah I love traveling with it because the
mirror is absolutely massive so I can
just do like my whole face in it it's
like a nice home not too orange II kind
of like brownie we've been really good
actually we haven't gone too crazy and
Sephora well we as we've grown up we do
this thing where we buy less but they
seem to do more expensive things and we
go straight for the hair carrying the
skincare and no makeup we didn't buy any
makeup no we walked straight past makeup
and yeah just to hair care and skincare
and kind of knew what we liked knew what
we wanted to do yeah we know we wanted
but then I always end up throwing extra
things in because you buy them you know
put the texture spray yeah but the
textures bring in my really good
protection spray it's really good but
then last night egg Fenty BC launched
like the Rihanna I was talking about and
Lily was like not interested no interest
on my whoa stupid names like Fendi
that's my first of all I think it's cuz
she got a sports
line that I don't I feel like she's got
another business I'm not like a massive
Rihanna fan but then this morning in
there she was like looking kids with no
I got email from Sephora I would email
it's just like wow it might be a Sephora
today so who knows maybe they'll be like
oh so I don't need it I hate a hype I'll
buy it in like a year's time you say
that but it did look quite pretty
didn't know you've been using the flood
for Sylar yes I love the a carbon block
color it is it's the second you don't
guess one
yeah the dark one is too black for me
but the medium one is really good and
it's got an awesome speed on it I just
used the glossy a boy brow because I
have my brows kind of like HD DUP
recently so yesterday I met Elana for
the first time she Elana Davidson I'll
link her channel down below watch a
video for a couple of years now
Anna would he met her at Coachella and I
was super jealous she was and I got to
meet yesterday and she's even prettier
in real life you walked away we were
like oh my god I think I went her bone
structure yeah bone structure her skin I
was like she's hilarious like she was
having all the lols with the waitress
I just need Solaris she's so lovely so
nice when you meet someone then you're
like are they great rather me like no
she was super super oh that doesn't
happen
she was super nice super great and I
liked her video she does Beauty videos
but beast videos have makeup but I want
to wear she's very into like no makeup
makeup
she's like a complete glossy age she
really is I'm using this what are you
using on iCarly you're so weird like
okay I can't predict you she's like
travel compact organizational freak she
burns a massive palette with her I think
I'm a little compact for eyeshadow thing
because I'm obsessed with this color low
blow like nothing compares to this cool
like D Potter yeah it's a V that if it
was a circle I probably would try over
do you have anything similar in is like
a single I'm obsessed with that and like
max over is wrong right similar this one
lobe like that's literally the same as
like a Mac cork
oh my cork that was really funny
sometimes I'm just been using the
bronzer on my eyelid but I basically
just take it on a massive Mac to t4 and
I try and do what lady does this is just
like this brush I've been using it's the
back job I try to find it on the face ok
website
I don't even if they do anyone's the
laura mercier finishing I I think it's
meant to conceal a it's one of those
like been tape it what's they called
really got like little hairs coming out
the top you arrow fiber and it's the
best for because sometimes I fell out
with eyeshadow brushes like if I use one
of these I put too much on and it puts
like a little amount it's this is the
best brush ever
what are you using what color are you
using well I can't really remember but I
feel like well all the glitters I think
you must find it really fun like I still
use that but it's my favorite and I
think I do still think it looks nice I'm
just not crazy into like shimmer my eye
we look out on shimmery is it's just not
it's not a shimmery it's it's it's like
creamy I don't know it doesn't give a
shimmer it's just the shiny shiny Jamie
we should do this more often
I'm enjoying this we'll read it in a
week's time it's cuz I have it actually
because we don't normally do makeup
tutorials anymore I don't actually know
I see like your favorites and stuff yeah
it's quite interesting to see what you
actually like use well we're telling
each other but we haven't really told
camera what we've been using so I write
everything down I'll send your list okay
I should write my own down because I
know you'll send me the list but I'll be
like a cop are you
I just back in the day I never wore
eyeshadow I was like do I should I say
grace and now if I don't wear it I feel
a bit naked yeah like I've really turned
a corner so I'm looking like a million
and one different mirrors how do you
think your like makeup tastes or like
attitude towards makeup has changed over
the last I feel like it's like the last
year we first changed a lot yeah I feel
like I've always been comfortable not
wearing makeup I'm not one of those like
I'm gonna have to put it on to go and
buy bread it's down the road people I
probably wear makeup like three days out
of a week yeah I just I found my
favourites
that's why we went to Sephora and
 me hair care and skin care cuz
I feel like I've found my favourites and
I just really loved them and that's kind
of me I think is exciting you know
because when you find your favorites and
you know what works for you it's a bit
like why why would I not use the things
that I know
for me yeah but it's like I think when a
few years ago would have been like
because we need to like turn out content
and like try yet but we've enjoyed like
making different content and then when
we make beauty it's like this is the
stuff we really really love I still love
watching like the videos with like five
different eyeshadows yeah I love
watching that like entertainment and
just seeing it and I just feel like on
me that's not the look I want to go for
I wanna go there like I said I didn't
but she looks like she do saying like I
did but I see a halo scrape I don't like
putting it directly on my skin because I
feel like it kind of drags I'm like
moves makeup around so put it on my
fingers and then I put the fingers
together and then I like having famous
I'm gonna use my like come back it's
creamy thing is that in hush yeah my
cream colored by hanpan you know what
we've been doing again and I haven't
done this for ages I've been keeping my
empties no way yeah I think even my
empties which I think this really needs
to go in the mac mineralize skinfinish
natural like you can see there okay
better see you can like see the back
I've just finished a glossy herb and
balance so yeah so keep it no I just
talked there I want to do like an
empties in a vlog so not like a proper
event ease but just a bit of empties so
organisation is about her content like
weeks in advance I just think it's good
to show that like what you use like a
lot of the stuff that we boil glossy it
or like repurchases and stuff that we've
like used up and Riaan of so I think
it's good to show you like it's cool to
and get to the end I'm using the YSL
shock water pre ahh I just opened my
glossy a cake and it's just like falling
out like it's got it's dead well I can
put it by hey that's Robin that is
rubbish sorry
go seams yeah this happens a lot I find
with lipsticks is it because it was
hasn't been that hot but it's like it's
melted it was a really hard product like
a rennet Squier
