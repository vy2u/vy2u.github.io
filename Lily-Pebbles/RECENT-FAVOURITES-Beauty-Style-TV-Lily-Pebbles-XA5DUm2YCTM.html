current favorites my beauty favorites
style TV all kinds of things and I
didn't actually do a November favorites
because I kind of forgot it just went
past me I obviously didn't have anything
to talk about or I just had lots of
other videos that I wanted to make so
this is kind of November and December
favorites put together I'm also not
going to be doing 2016 favorites I used
to do like these epic favorites videos
at the end of the year and go through
all of my favorite beauty products from
the whole year but I actually find them
quite boring to make and I don't think
they're that interesting for you guys
really I've kind of slim lined the
products that I use and I think you guys
know what my favorites are so I'm gonna
be making other content that's a bit
different this year so these are kind of
like my end of year favorites just from
the past couple of months I'll start
with Beauty and the thing I have right
in front of me here is the Aussie 3
minute miracle winter remedy so I've
used the Aussie 3 minute miracle many
times before it's a deep hydrating
conditioner for your hair this is the
winter remedy deep treatment so it says
same fab formula as miracle shine but
with Australian ginseng extract and
pearl powder I don't know if that means
this is a different formula or just a
different packaging either way I love
the packaging of this one because this
is the bottle upside down so when you
place it on your shelf this is actually
where the product comes out so rather
than having to turn it and wait for the
product you literally just squeeze it
you don't have to sit lid off and it
comes out so fast so many innuendos
going on here but it's seriously so easy
to use and I love the formula of this
conditioner because it's real like
instant gratification you put on your
hair and it immediately feels soft and
silky I also saved this it's actually
finished but I wanted to mention it in
this video this is the Space NK
shimmering spice candle I absolutely
love this candle I have a few winter
sense burning and this one's definitely
stood out out of all of them if they
still have this in stock I would really
really recommend picking it up I might
actually get another one it just smells
like Christmas but it's not too
cinnamony because I don't love cinnamon
scent it's just not too much of anything
it's kind of subtle and perfect and also
it looks beautiful I've like a tiny bit
in there but you know I can never really
like burn the end of a candle this is so
delicious
the lipstick I'm wearing today I've been
wearing in a lot of my recent kind of
sit down videos I get so many questions
about it and it's from Stealer it's
called queen and it's kind of like
a lie look I've just been obsessed with
this collar loose in here you can see
like my nails my jacket my lips my eyes
I don't know what's going on here but
I'm thinking about doing a makeup
tutorial maybe in the new year there's
like a lion look pink makeup tutorial
because my eyes and my lips i've been
loving wearing this combo i'll talk
about the eye shadow in a minute this is
the lipstick from Stila and it's a matte
lipstick and yeah it's pretty much like
look it's kind of a bit grey it's very
weird but i like to put it on the lips
and then i use my finger to kind of
blend it in because always you can still
see that my lips are quite pink
underneath and i just think it looks so
kind of soft and a little bit quirky and
different but so so I'm looking down at
the kind of viewfinder because I feel
like I need to see what it looks like to
describe it to you guys I've just been
loving wearing this I've been loving
wearing it with the eyeshadow which I'm
also wearing today and this eyeshadow is
from NARS
it's the khari eyeshadow so I've got a
little solo shadow here it actually
comes with a little mirror in it which
is cute and it's a little bit like all
that glitters but more kind of taupe and
less pink it's slightly shimmery I mean
you can see it on my lids I think it's
so easy I can just wear it by itself
sometimes I use like Mac sable in the
outer corners and underneath and a bit
of eyeliner for this you can definitely
wear by itself which is kind of the
beauty of it and I've been wearing it
pretty much for like the last month
sorry if the lighting is a bit funny in
this video I feel like I look a little
bit green on camera but it's it's so
dark and wintery at the moment I'm
having to use all artificial lights so
you guys know that I've been suffering
from really really sore lips I go on
about it all the time because it's been
unbearable I was allergic to a soap &amp;amp;
Glory lipstick that I wore my wedding
day and then as they started to get
better the weather changed and it got
really cold and my lips just never
recovered so it's been like a good three
four months of really dry sore lips and
a lot of you been asking if I've had my
lips done
I haven't they've just been so like
swollen around the edges and the outer
corners have been so cracked I haven't
been able to like eat sets of foods
where I need to open my mouth really
wide it's been an absolute nightmare and
this week I was
ready to go to the dermatologist I was
gonna throw my GP get a referral a lot
of my friends suffer from eczema so I've
been like taking their advice on what to
do and how to get in contact with a
dermatologist and then I was with my
friend Hannah and I thought like let's
just go and buy a couple more lip balms
I have tried every lip balm I swear I've
tried all the obvious ones that you go
to Mecca been recommending like eight
hour cream Carmex that German one that I
usually love I try to have Bobby Brown
I've tried like the bite Beauty agave
lip mask I feel like I've tried so many
so I went to the pharmacy and I bought
the Lucas pawpaw cream and I also bought
this one which is from Bioderma it's
their moisturizing and stick and I've
been using this for two or three days
now or when filming this video and my
lips feel so much better
they just feel more like flexible it's
the dryness my lips have been so dry and
tight that I haven't been able to like
open my mouth properly and they
definitely feel different so I'm gonna
keep using this I'm literally putting so
much on it's also great because I don't
have to use my fingers which isn't you
know it's not really good to touch your
lips and their saw I only literally have
gone through so much of this already I'm
gonna use it to death and then see if
they get better I might not have to go
see a doctor which would be amazing if
this is the cure I will let you guys
know alright enough of the lip ramble on
to the next Beauty favorites and this is
a beautiful nail polish from Dior I mean
nail polish isn't usually something I
think to invest in I was actually sent
this and it is beautiful it would make
such a nice Christmas gift if it's not
already sold out the packaging itself is
just gorgeous it comes with this little
gold lid and it's like round it's a
different shape to normal nail polishes
this is called Dior rific and the color
is 0:01 nova and it's very different to
any other kind of glitter polish I've
tried it's meant to resemble broken
glass and I really think it does look
like a broken mirror
you can either layer over a nail polish
or what I've done is just layered it
over kind of plain nails and I think it
looks beautiful and very like a subtle
Sparkle that you can only see in certain
lights it's like a nice way of doing
Christmas nails it's not too
over-the-top I recently went to the LMS
spa with rich it was like a wedding gift
for us from LMS and it was so nice they
have a penthouse spa where there's two
beds and you
have like couples massages or facials
that we can go to your mom or sister and
it was really really great I've been
there before and I loved it and after as
I couldn't help but buy it pretty much
everything in the shop one of the things
I picked up was the elements superfood
facial oil you can see how much I've
used already I've been using this every
night before I go to bed and I really
really like it it's got loads of great
ingredients in it hence the superfood
name and it just feels so nourishing I
love using oils on my skin especially in
the winter I've really liked this one it
feels a bit more natural and less kind
of heavily scented than some of the
other oils I've used before final beauty
product and a very very exciting one
this is the pixie and Caroline Horan's
double cleanse
Caroline's a very good friend of mine
and I'm so excited for her that she has
collaborated with pixie for this product
it's coming out in January caught mine
the exact date I will put the details in
the description box below
it's the perfect product for Caroline's
launch with it's called the double
cleanse she introduced me to the whole
idea of double cleansing so it has a
bomb cleanser on the left so a really
nice kind of bomb that turns into an oil
great for taking your makeup off and
then a cream cleanser on the right so
what you're taking your makeup off you
can cleanse using the cream and it
really kind of cleanses the skin itself
I really love double cleansing and this
makes it really easy both products and
very nice non-offensive I can't imagine
any skin would react to this kind of
product it's not like heavily scented or
anything like that and yeah I'm really
excited for her so that'll be coming out
in January so now some style favorites
which if you follow me on snapchat
that's usually where I show all these
things that you probably would have seen
them all a million times already
first of all these boots for Matt jigsaw
now I've wanted some new boots for ages
I had some from Steve Madden but they
were suede so they looked really kind of
old and tatty and they the toes slightly
rounded I just felt like I'd grown out
the style of it I've seen some from
Saint Laurent that I loved saying a walk
that sounds better but I'm just not
going to say that but they're a fortune
and I haven't quite got into the whole
like spending lots of money on shoes yet
because they just go on the floor I find
that a bit weird but I think investing
in a good pair of shoes is is good idea
because they're usually more comfortable
and they last longer I like to go
somewhere in the middle so jigsaw isn't
you know it's not cheap but it's not
high-end designer I found these and they
pretty much look just like the acne
still boots I think that's what they're
called so they're almost flat tiny bit
of a heel they've got this kind of
Chelsea boot style up here and I love
the crinkly nosov the boot like the fact
they look quite old and worn that's
exactly what I was looking for and I
love them they're so comfortable they go
with jeans they go with like dresses
I've been wearing them all the time I've
also been loving my watch which I also
get a lot of questions about from you
guys I picked this up in a shop in
Brighton called the workshop I think
though sorry it's called workshop living
me and Hannah absolutely love that shop
and the guys in there who owners so so
sweet so definitely go check it out if
you're in Brighton this watch is from a
brand called the horse and I saw it and
I instantly knew I wanted it because I
was on the lookout for a watch that
wasn't black this is my old watch from
Daniel Wellington and I really liked it
but I just found like the black was so
harsh against my skin and once I had
like my engagement ring on my wedding
ring on I just fell like it didn't
complement it at all so I wanted a watch
that was kind of a softer color and the
downfall of this is that it does get
really grubby and I tried to use a
leather wipe and it's kind of like ruins
or leather a bit so I don't think this
strap is going to last me very long but
hopefully I can just replace it but I
really love the color against my skin
tone and with my ring and everything it
just suits me so much better the metals
rose gold and the strap is kind of a
light pink okay final style favorite is
this scarf from ASOS I've been wearing
this every day since I got it it's super
long really soft it has tassels
it's the perfect gray you would have
seen it already in my a so school so I
won't go on about it too much but it was
like 12 pounds it's the best thing I've
bought in months I will link it below
because it's my favorite scarf ever I'm
so happy I got it
okay I have three TV shows to quickly
talk about planet Earth - I love David
Attenborough I love Planet Earth and all
the programs he did what was it planet
Earth and the blue planet they're all so
good this one was incredible there were
some very memorable moments if you
watched it snakes the flamingos the
cheetah in India Oh anyway if you
haven't watched it and I don't this is
gonna make sense but it's an incredible
wildlife program and I'd definitely
recommend watching it the second TV show
is at the crown me and rich watch it
Netflix we got through it very quickly
it's all about the royal family and I
don't think you need to be a fan of the
royal family to watch it even if you
don't like them it's really interesting
program they put a lot of money into it
into the casting the Wardrobe the
scenery what my thinking like not venue
car my what's called like where they
filmed it and stuff a set set design
it's so well done and it starts from
when the King dies and Queen Elizabeth
has to take over and it kind of shares a
lot of stories that I think not a lot of
people knew and it was just done so well
the actors are brilliant in it and I
really enjoyed watching it I can't wait
for the next season I think there's a
next season I hope there is the final
one is a program I talk about all the
time but it's the missing the missing
season two is so worth watching season
one and season two you don't blink at
all so if you haven't watched season one
doesn't matter I would say just go
straight on to season two the first one
season one's more about when a child
goes missing what happens and season two
is more about when the missing child
returns what happens and it's so well
done is so gripping it's not like gory
and horrible it's just so addictive and
the final episode was one of the best
final episodes I've ever watched I
thought it was brilliant it gave me so
much closure
I hate when final episodes just leave
you hanging and I just thought it was
brilliant I've met the writers of the
missing and I think they're great so I
think there's all my favorites from at
the last kind of two months this will be
my last favorites of the year and also
my last kind of main video before
Christmas so I hope you all have a
lovely Christmas day spend some time
with family eat good food and don't
