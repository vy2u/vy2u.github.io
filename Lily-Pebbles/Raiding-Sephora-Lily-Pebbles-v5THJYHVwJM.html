for an hour and a half and I don't know
why but I'm still rushed I'm actually
late to go down to the lobby we've got
the photo shoot today I look awful I
hate getting ready early in the morning
it's too rushed too early I hate my
makeup I hate my hair and I have to
upload this blog somehow time difference
makes it really hard to upload these
vlogs anyway nice to start a vlog with a
Mon kind of looking forward to the photo
shoot I think once I get there I'll be
excited but I really need to go down to
the lobby I bought a few like change of
clothes and my new camera bag I'm loving
and I take you guys with me on the shoot
Oh God what does my hair look like oK
we've arrived at the shoot all very
rushed it's absolutely freezing here but
the girls have started they've gotten to
get there with her in wardrobe
I'm like the last one so I'm just gonna
hang paint my nails because they're a
state and hopefully warm up the girls
okay good man makeup done of course with
the streaming eyes today is Lydia and
Amelia Karla have you got that is easy
because they will drop dial it straight
away
and then I'm gonna get my chosen
lipstick for me okay I've had my hair
done and I've just sat down to get my
lipstick what's my lipstick color code
we are gonna put you in a rush which is
a nice pink remote I'm showing me my
lips are done and it looks purple but
it's definitely it's funny like I'm
gonna get photos taken socials gonna dip
you're taking clips of me
and now I'm done I'm done with my shoot
it was fixed range I had to like walk
with my lipstick school rush scientific
rushing around here I think we're gonna
get some food and then hit the hotel my
spicy crispy chicken sandwich was so
good we're gonna rush back to the hotel
quickly change and then everyone that's
to go to Sephora I think I'm gonna have
to buy the anasazi globe palette that I
made kind of Lydia buy any other day but
you don't need another palette and now
the highlight just looks amazing so I
want to buy it
hello that's on my list so sorry that I
hadn't looked much today it's been
absolutely mental we've just been like
throwing around everywhere it started so
early the shoot this morning was it was
really cool in the end I had the
lipstick brush as I think I told you so
they wants me to look like I was rushing
somewhere so it's really hard like I'm
not a model so it was quite hard to like
do what they were asking me to do I had
to like kind of walk in a rush but have
my face looking good so I have no idea
how the photos are gonna come out but
hopefully they'll be one wasn't
massively happy like in a dress but I
think I'll be cool I don't know I'm not
that fast buyer I think it was quite fun
today so the girls are leaving this
afternoon and they want to go and they
leave exci I want to give them as much
time as possible they want to go to a
Sephora again I've got a couple more
days here so I'm not as rushed to like
go to shops but let me go with them it
will be fun and then it's gonna be sad
to say bye to everyone made some good
friends on this trip everyone's would be
nice so I'll take you guys with us to
the shop I swear we've done more than
just go to Sephora there hasn't been
much free time but I'm hoping over the
next couple of days I can just relax and
do more like browsing and mooching
around I've seen all the New York sites
before and done all the touristy things
the girls are like frantically repacking
I see
getting ready for their flight we're in
the cab wait can you guys tell me what's
on your list of things that you need
scare okay I will not show you get in
Lily
totally screwed me over I was like Lily
you need to control me suck meat you
don't need that and then she managed to
convince Lydia out of one not two but
she convinced me other - I'm Toni baby
oh so you won the liquid lipsticks are
sold out everywhere some of us don't
even stop them reversed our PDF the
media's getting a basket it's so cute
I always start without a basket hope for
the best I think I'm gonna try this
L'Oreal Lumi cushion foundation because
we haven't got it in UK and everyone's
going on about it we're down with CBS
and we're gonna head to Ricky's now look
the boys see with this Ricky's is I've
never even heard of it why do I have
looking out like I'm some 60-person
going into Ricky whatever Ricky's is
there guys I'm thinking of getting these
what do you think oh my god dad's if
you're watching these are my me or your
sister in the 90s they are amazing and
we will picks up quite a few more things
things that will be my last trip for a
while I'm here I need to stop buy me
stuff actually want to violate train as
opposed to stuff but with all the beauty
girls so they want to go to Sephora and
I think Marissa clothes shopping medias
trying to decide whether to get this
lipstick
I think it's nice like a nudie plum
mainly things of gold and they pick you
up your face like a personal way out
this is amazing the best looking fruit
we've accumulated quite a lot of stuff
in this basket is will just thrown in
together a little sushi picnic at the
table I got the brown rice and salmon
avocado and everyone else but like a mix
of stuff I want it all melee is hijacked
my bathroom to take off her makeup
everyone's gone now and left me and I'm
really happy that I'm still here but it
is a bit of a weird feeling everyone
like going and I know I'm not alone cuz
Keisha's in the same city as me and
actually Lucy's hair as well she's
leaving tomorrow so not alone but it
just feel weird to like be in the hotel
alone and that they've all just left so
I'm gonna have a moment in my room I'm
gonna FaceTime rich and then I think I'm
seeing Kisha for dinner which would be
really nice
Kisha has come to join me now in my
hotel room hello you enjoy my little
window seat we're trying to find
somewhere to go for dinner we were
thinking either like Mexican or Thai I
do love a good theme but we're just
chillin it's nice to just be like it's
nice to just be like sitting and not
doing much because it's been so like go
go go
I'm really enjoying this I'm just going
to put on a little bit makeup I'm not
going to dress up I just want to have
like a chilled whatever maybe look at a
few shops along the way if they're open
it's nice not having a routine is that
they only accept American Express but
normally they never accept we only
accept American Express that is really
weird as the opposite of every place in
London and we're getting on the subway
we're not gonna get I'm not getting
driven around New York in the chauffeur
any more help create a real world is
back where are we actually going to come
be md-82 come be on me and where is the
downtown slow down
yeah okay everyone's looking at me
before blog in New York it harder than
London get myself a MetroCard real New
Yorker right here I did not bring the
right clothes miss whether I'm making
Keisha problems with a disaster because
I know he doesn't watch myself but he
won't now he's happy in the shop
anywhere
that place is far too trendy for its own
good
in an hour to an hour and a half for
tables with two for some tacos I mean
come on guys seriously I love kissing a
really cool shop so now we're on the
hunt for some other food maybe tie I
mean I'm not that fast it'd look cool
but feels a bit loud anyway
so we ended up going to a little Thai
restaurant that was really nice actually
not the best Thai I've had but really
cool like New York vibes and there's
very loud
my throat's really hurting from all this
like talking in loud restaurants I came
back on the subway alone
Kisha like put me on the subway told me
how many stops it wasn't where to get
off I feel like Ana would be very proud
of me I did it I came out the wrong
accent completely panicked and thought
there's almost following me but I made
it back safe and sound now I'm back at
my little hotel room that literally
feels like home to me it just feels so
weird to be alone in a hotel room so
often these days like I never used to
ever be in hotel rooms alone I was
always with rich or someone so like my
own little hub here I mean these
shopping bags are ridiculous and I'm
gonna pack these I hope I've got room
and now I've got to get ready for bed
and edit this little vlog I'm gonna give
myself time bit of a line tomorrow and
then film video and then I've got a kind
of busy day again tomorrow so I'll be
vlogging that and I will try to you guys
then why have I just got out of focus
hello
