actually watched James Corden and Gwen
Stefani's cut carpool karaoke it's got
George Clooney and Julia Roberts in it
it was actually epic I really enjoyed it
I'm sitting here on my window sill and I
don't know if you can see but it's
absolutely
hissss eaten down with rain like really
pissing down so I'm kind of not sure
what to do this morning I'm going to
Soho which is quite far from where I am
and I'm going to get subway but I'm
gonna go meet Lucy and Carrie from Glee
my management we can have breakfast and
then I'm actually popping into the Bobbi
Brown offices here because I'm really
close with the Bobbi Brown UK team and
they were like or if you're in New York
you should go say hi
apparently the officers are pretty
amazing so I'm gonna go there with Kisha
and have a little look around and then
we were gonna just mooch around some
shops in Soho but this weather is not
mooching weather I mean seriously I like
zoom in on some people down there the
the you know and it's so wet but like
the ground looks like there's like waves
of water in it it's really really
pissing down also I put terrible shoes
with me I bought like heels gym trainers
which have holes in them and they get
soaking wet if I go out in the rain like
gold shoes I can't get wet and then my
white trainers so I'm wearing my white
trainers they're gonna get destroyed so
we're gonna see how the weather is
after the Bobbi Brown meeting if it's
still raining I'm gonna come back to the
hotel and just spend the afternoon
filming videos if it's alright then
we'll have a little mature answer home
it's okay there because I feel like nuke
is the one place I tend to come back to
quite regularly like maybe once a year
if I'm lucky so I'm not missing out that
much I just really want to pop back in
to me well and that's the only place
maybe Steve Madden but other than that
most things we can get at home
I just love walking around Soho and like
Greenwich Village when it's nice but
it's not nice then it's not nice to walk
around and so I'll bring you guys along
with me today I'm just waiting for Kisha
I also didn't bring anything with a hood
he should just turned up she's like a
drowned rat and now it's made me even
more nervous about going out and she's
got like a huge jacket in like like
waterproof shoes destroyed and I've got
my knees and ankles out gonna break the
subway oh my god you're so prepared you
everstik off made it down some
yes very wouldn't be out there first
tell you guys I'm literally wearing a
leather jacket under my bomber I'm
wearing two jackets the rains kind of
slowing down it's now like frigid air
weather is definitely for its own
weather it looked awful we're now
heading to the bobbi brown head offices
and I'm really excited
the I said before is a New York brands
I'm guessing this is like their main
office and actually we were gonna be
able to meet Bobby Brown quiche but
she's on a sheet today otherwise we
would have met her but I'm gonna go meet
the PR PR girl I think just say hey and
have a look around the office
noise I found a space in cage I'm pretty
sure it's exactly this day and so far
there were no brands over the truth
bring a little bit rained on for in the
left you have full floor Bobby Brown
offices don't know what to expect
don't know you're meeting but a lot stro
all right this is Bobby Brown's actual
office look how amazing it is in here
I'm in Steve Madden just looking messin
shoes both for my wedding had also just
boots I love living in half sizes here
seriously life-changing and so if I pick
these Jews Fenton I think I thought I
already choose all I'm about to I
already choose they're very simple but
they're comfortable and I can jump up
and down and start my little butt off so
that's the main thing in Keisha was here
when I bought them I was logged in a
little while we went to made well and
Lululemon I didn't get anything either
properly we're gonna maybe grab a little
food may be spoken to
and then head back to the hotel before
like two or three videos and each film
I've got my last hour goatee chocolate
mint tea Pacino I'm very excited this
they just pour the gin count without
Chloe key she's like yeah wait what do
you mean she gives Chloe is her name
back at the hotel
actually it's like half three it's a bit
later than kind of thought it's not late
but the lights getting darks is not
great weather so I'm gonna quickly eat
some food and then attempt to film some
videos and make myself look presentable
so if my like main videos if I don't
look great that's because you know where
I wasn't I film them hey we got some
stuff for Dean &amp;amp; Deluca what did you
actually get huge hmm
I got some like spinach and quinoa salad

mmm-hmm I'm gonna attempt to film a
couple of cool videos now so I'll get
back to you guys afterwards okay I've
just filmed three videos that did a
beautiful an on beauty haul video with

have my back is killing me eating these
like snap crisps P P P please snap first
NFP man Keisha can't stop singing yeah
uh thank you should just said we have to
listen to it to get it out of my head
and I'm saying what does that even mean
so apparently if you listen to a song
