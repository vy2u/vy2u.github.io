now I've been fussing about this morning
getting ready because today I'm going to
film my monthly favorites video which is
going up on Sunday and I need to like
gather all my things and get ready but I
think I'm gonna change up where I'm
filming today something about daily
vlogging makes me feel really really
awkward about sitting down to film a
proper video it's just to like
contrasting with the vlogs so I'm going
to try and make this month's monthly
favorites quite casual and I might sit
in my bedroom I'm gonna see if it works
if I just like sit there with that
behind me I thought my favorites here
sneak peek and yeah I've just done my
makeup I've got kind of blue liquid
eyeliner on and a very lightly put Tom
Ford wild ginger on for a bit orange and
I've done something a little bit
different my hair I'm not sure how I
feel about it I've done like a half
button and then I've done some Platts as
well my phone's ringing anyway so I'm
gonna go get my camera and see if I can
film here with like natural light and
stuff and see how it goes okay I just
filmed it was a really quick actually
and now I'm just doing all the close-ups
and I'm just gonna put some things in
this little marble sap and film it like
that okay I'm back at my desk I just
need to finish editing yesterday's vlog
and put that live sketch to Nick tonight
and then I'm gonna start editing my
favourites video and I really hope that
came out okay so different I normally do
my videos okay a monthly favourites
edited and done well exporting I'm gonna
go make some lunch I bought some like
tortellini pasta yesterday when I bought
the dinner stuff so I'm gonna go make
that also tonight me and rich I go into
a film premiere and I think it's just
arrived we're going to see the spy movie
which has Melissa McCarthy from
bridesmaids and from like everything
she's hilarious this guy Jason Streatham
I think that's the guy that rich loves
is he Game of Thrones I don't know I
don't watch it I'm Jude Law who is just
like the love of my life I love him so
yeah you 2 tickets and we're gonna go
and I think it's like a fancy premiering
Jim Chapman's doing the red carpet as
well so be nice to see him again don't
think I'm going to dress up I just I
don't want to get dressed up and sit in
a cinema but I'll try and make myself
look presentable just in case but I
think anyone's gonna be taking photos of
me anyway so that'll be really nice for
me and rich to do tonight I just got
this beautiful bikini sent to me by a
brand called Oh Tillie and I wanted to
show you because it's so so nice
unfortunately though I ordered the
extra-large
and I've just kind of copped this up to
me like this
and it's just not gonna fit like
extra-large I think that's quite like
quite small I know it sounds ridiculous
I'm going to try it on properly but I
hope I really hope it fits because this
is such a pretty bikini and blue bottoms
and then the top is like blue and pink
is quite padded it feels like really
good quality so it's like this it has
got straps that go over I don't know I'm
gonna try it on then have a look I think
I got the bottoms in the medium but if
that fits is so so nice really pretty I
will link up that brand below if you
want to go see their other bikinis okay
for lunch I'm going to have I bought
these yesterday
they're like ricotta and spinach
tortellini tortellini put Salone and
what is the source bits multi source
then it cooks the whole pack so I can
have the leftovers before we go out
tonight you have to cook for a minutes
and it's fresh so I tried on the bikini
and surprise surprise it doesn't fit
polymers I have a restore back but large
cup size so it's very hard with the
bikinis that do up like a bra that is
never going to fit
I need ones that you can kind of adjust
and I'm quite broad so I need like
thicker straps and I just I'm gonna give
up on the whole bikini thing um it was
really pretty though so maybe I'll find
a friend that it might fit to give it to
or something my videos just processing
and I'm gonna put all in all I'm gonna
put all the info in now and schedule
that for Sunday and then get on with
some other work for this afternoon
getting back into blogging this feels
good do you love a tick look a like no
ticks it's not ticking again now I'm
currently writing a blog post and it
just reminded me to vlog because I
haven't blogged for a couple of hours
I'm actually doing a blog post on tips
the day you vlog iam because this is for
next week and by then every day may
would have ended and I feel like I've
learnt quite a lot from doing this
I share it with you guys I'm talking
about equipment you need getting
confident vlogging in public how to plan
out your vlogs and videos so if you
don't already read my blog it is just
little pebbles Dakota UK and yeah I'll
be posting that next week so keep an eye
out for it if you want to daily vlog -
because I know a lot of you guys also
have YouTube channels whenever I meet
people are like beautycon a place like
that there's so many bloggers and
youtubers who are also fewers which is
great so I always want to give as many
tips and like helpful things as I can
before I get ready for tonight I'm just
prepping for tomorrow because I'm going
to Anna's to film a beauty chat and it's
a throwback theme so she just sent me
all the questions that just pics from
you guys on Twitter and I've been trying
to get some like photos and diary
entries doing a food service on me I
don't think is going up for a while cuz
I'm pretty sure we just put my one up
but look I'll show you a sneak peek of
some of these photos that's me
year six dance Tammy girl dress I'm just
trying to get like ten photos so that
maybe she communicated the room the
video if she wants to but hope you could
reference with a lot of questions about
makeup and hair my printer is making a
really weird noise okay ten minutes of
sitting down time before I need to get
ready
tell me gonna yeah I need to get ready
I'm just gonna read ASOS magazines just
came in the post and I always think it's
actually really good
okay I need to start getting ready now
my dream is such a mess please ignore
the mess behind me I'm just gonna kind
of brighten up my makeup I think I might
be for my hair like this I'm not sure I
might change the bond but and just yeah
brighten up my makeup a bit pushy my
dark circles they're very dark okay I'm
pretty much ready I'm just gonna put
some lipstick on I'm not even going to
show you why I'm wearing because it's
the same thing I've worn all month every
time I've gone out
whistles charles's Topshop top leather
jacket I have no other clothes so I
think we're gonna head off soon okay
we're ready to go and we're being a bit
naughty Emma get it ooh but just because
I wanted to wear heels about these
Topshop girls and I just know I won't be
able to get achieve it and walk which is
looking dapper I'm sure I just not sure
about this jacket though rich me mother
I think we need to get you a new jacket
it's a bit like it's a bit like primary
school blazer very strange things that
have an app on the way to a film
premiere but I had to force myself it's
like a sleeping coma because booba they
use Prius most of the time like car and
then you make me feel so sick me and
Anna just can't handle even a Prius and
that guy was particularly terrible at
driving personally
what were you an inference upon us okay
we're gonna go find find the premier now
so busy unless it's very alert right you
love Turin
let's go fine let's go find Jim we're
not entirely sure how to actually get in
to the red carpet area kind of on the
outside of it now
and I'm sure everybody's like how do I
get on the red carpet because if we
could find a way we found the way in and
there's a huge queue great brain really
comfy shoes where the doors are open so
scary big bright red carpet
action going on now behind me to go even
to me I think I went back in time
there's Jim on the big screen
which guys
during pleasure
dude
good evening hugs how are you just a
Peter Serafinowicz miss Allison Janney
Miranda Hart
that's the jebal naege you need
somewhere nice and low Melissa McCarthy
I don't want you enjoy watching it as
much as we enjoyed making and I love
everybody think you just left film and
it was really good it was it good like
it's good compromise for me rich to see
because it was really perfect SHINee
she likes there's also really funny as
the same director for bridesmaids a
couple of the same like actors in it I
thought it was really funny rich like it
was kind of a bit more like Sophie then
you would prefer Ilyas mourn the comedy
side than the action side I thought I
really jumped like is you properly jump
over jump yeah look he's do that
actually stuff we're gonna go get some
food from the server etai our favorite
place
I'm so hungry I'm gonna have like a huge
part time sacrifice it
okay so I'm home now uber was doing that
annoying thing where it says it's like
two times the fare which would have cost
me like fifty quid to get home instead
of 20 so we had to get the tube and I
was wearing heels and they're so
uncomfortable I don't understand the
secret to heels like don't understand
how girls wear heels they're not even
that high those heels and they were
killing me I've got this black-tie event
on Monday and I don't know any dresses
because I don't dress in dresses I don't
dress up like that and I don't want
heels so I don't know what I'm gonna do
if there's any tips for a black tie for
people who don't dress up I'm a casual
person or like a smart casual I just
don't like wearing little dresses and
heels anyway I'm just being grumpy
because my feet hurt to me so if you
hate feet look my toe
oh so so the film was really good it was
really funny and it was cool to see
everyone there Jason
everyone's gonna get annoyed for me for
forgetting his name but the Jason guy in
it he seemed so nice he really like had
so much time for all his fans and like
even when he came into the cinema he was
taking time to say hi to people Jude Law
didn't seem that friendly in real life
just an observation there highlight of
my day was probably seeing Jim on the
red carpet actually because when I
really like when good things happen to
good people and I feel like he's worked
really hard for where he's got to and he
looked really nervous like you know
anything just tell someone's face that
they're really nervous but he did really
well it is so scary to do something like
that
I mean hats off to him it's so hard
doing like live TV or anything like that
but when you're interviewing huge
celebrities as well and there's an
audience standing there watching you
there's a huge microphone in middle of
Leicester Square with like speakers it's
really scary so yeah it felt very like
proud of him proud of like youtubers I
like seeing when youtubers do cool
amazing things I'm gonna have a cup of
tea now and get ready for bed I'm
shattered tomorrow is the last day
technically of everyday May although I'm
gonna continue vlogging just not every
day and I'm going to Anna's for a study
day we need to film and do some work and
stuff so I will see you guys tomorrow
night this guy's towards the chips
with people with this this I need to
pick up some popcorn on the way though
because I'm so hungry and yeah I'm gonna
head home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
