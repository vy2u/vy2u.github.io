nice night last night and and oh my god
that bed is so comfy it's so big it
makes me want to get a big bed I'm gonna
finish up filming here and then I'm I'm
gonna finish up filming here and then
I'm gonna head to Anna's room and I
think we're gonna get breakfast in the
room maybe I quite like having breakfast
in the room my ball go down I did I'll
see what she's thinking I'm loving that
Anna so in snapshots hilarious I hit my
snapchat this morning okay a makeup done
and videos done that the second part the
video definitely isn't as good as the
first I was running out of battery and
time so um and I didn't really know how
to end it so I basically just crawled on
the fourth floor and then waved to the
camera which is really weird and I also
walked out the room without my case and
none of it makes sense but I've done it
so that's great
Anna's ordered breakfast I asked for
what did I get I got the traditional
British which is fresh juice tea or
coffee white or brown bat bread and then
two eggs with sausage bacon mushrooms
Smarties black pudding and baked beans
that's like proper full English
breakfast I asked for like dippy egg
soft-boiled eggs million to those at the
moment I'm really hungry so I'm looking
for what's breakfast and my head over to
Anna's now actually cute these photos
are from last night that's rich as arty
one sitting in front of the painting me
and rich I like that one and her mark
oh and rich doing his face chart which
was hilarious he was so into it
okay I'm gonna head to Anna's room now
take my laptop in case I can edit
deserve this is mine the picky with
orange juice and tea Patten bread and I
got french toast Oh a nice little oats
I'm glad to get it smells like cinnamon
yeah I'm sesame he does smell cinnamon
II my eyes are always bigger than my
stomach look failed
how's yours
like two slices yeah but now I'm eating
your breakfast hey I'm done editing my
vlog or there's 18 minutes long and I
can't wait to watch it again to edit
down I'm gonna try and carry my laptop
back to my room without this
disconnecting which it always does and
pack my stuff and it's like here and
then I'm gonna go home I'm gonna get a
cab this time because coming where the
suitcase was horrific and I've got more
stuff to take back with me now cuz bitch
has left his stuff there's problems at
the station that yeah that's a really
good excuse so I need to get back okay
I'm leaving the hotel room but I always
feel like I've forgotten something
suitcase I think I think that's
everything
oh god this is like really important
let's do my hotel just sat down edited
the vlog and it's uploading now so I
wish for calm ones I know buddy do it
the night before so when I'm doing it on
the morning I get a bit like Oh kind of
key but it's going up is fine I've done
the description box and everything I'm
now gonna head to Asda I'm actually
doing some work with us too but I'm not
gonna talk about it much in this blog
because this specific vlog is not
sponsored and I don't want to like blur
the lines but I need to make like a
twenty ten to twenty second really like
snappy video and I kind of like a
challenge it's gonna be hard to make
like such a quick video so I'm gonna
head let's pick up some stuff and then
I'm gonna see how now we're gonna go for
a walk I'm gonna pick up those tapes
from snappy snaps I got four tapes put
onto DVD I gave a 50 pound deposit on
the weekend and they said there's ninety
pounds left to pay so I think it's a
hundred and forty in total I'm just a
lot of money for four tapes I said I'd
let you guys know how much it was I saw
a lot of comments telling me that I can
buy a machine that does it but I've
looked into it before and I think you
need to have a VHS player
we don't have one anymore oz broke so
there's a lot of leads that you can
connect your VHS player to your DVD
player but we don't have an actual VHS
player I could maybe buy one it just
looks so complicated I've tried to find
ways someone sent me a link to an
American website that does it but they
don't
for UK so at the moment I feel like
snacky sacks as the only option but I'm
still looking into cheaper alternatives
camera Asda as there will always remind
me of unique at where I am now I don't
have an answer that local to me but that
was our local supermarkets that's where
we did all whew chuckling and I'll never
forget when we discovered that as their
own chocolate bar 20 P for chocolate bar
and it tastes just like galaxy we
literally stocked up we loved Asda own
milk chocolate I'm gonna go in and get
what I need okay I'm gonna spend the
next hour making a 10 to 20 second video
and then I will be back with you okay
I've done the video it took me about two
and a half hours to make a 20 second
video but I think it came out alright
we'll see and I'm gonna go now meet
Hannah we're gonna go for a nice walk
because it's really sunny and to pick up
those DVDs just waiting for Hannah to
turn up - realize I have an easy lunch
here boys with me - spaghetti meals
and I suddenly hungry maybe I could find
something and turn our home most of my
friends are late to people not in a mean
way they don't mean it in a horrible way
they're just sort of people who won't be
there you know there won't be there at
the time you're supposed to meet I'm
very much like an early person if not on
time I think it's because if I if I
think I could be some of three I kind of
think in my head I've got a beer at
coarsest III to make sure I'm definitely
there whereas most my friends I think
it's to be summer three they start kind
of panicking at three and then they
leave the house so comment on this video
let me know if you're a late person or a
on time or early person that you just
are what you are most of my friends are
eight people
I'm just walking with Hannah and I told
you guys last time that if I saw Hannah
this week I would ask her Christian she
has no idea what am I talking about but
basically it's I did know I did so
everyone's taking exams everyone's
revise aid and I was like oh I didn't
know I wish I could have given me some
advice and then I realized I couldn't
give you advice anyway because I did
failed everything but I said that you
were really good at revising and I
remember you haven't folders or folders
of stuff obviously it's a bit late now
hmm but I wondered if you had any last
minute revising tips for people put on
the spot here I can think of a few
actually so the best thing I did when I
was rising and I was really militant
crazy person when I revised I did um
like a timetable so even if it's just
for like three days before your exams
with all your modules split it out into
timetable and do all your hard ones in
the morning because that's when you
probably work best and do them first and
then you can do the easier things that
build up your confidence just before
your exams towards the end oh that's a
good one I just remember Jesus he's I
used to go around when you remember six
to eight yeah you do you a s levels I
was in GCSEs and you had like she had
like a proper full-on timetable I wasn't
great keeping to it but I think that's a
good idea cuz yeah like a guy you have
to like live and breathe the timetable
yeah and stick to it like all the time
yeah and also maybe the morning isn't
your best time maybe it's the evening
like for me morning is a hundred percent
my best time and I can't do any work
after seven so if you kill it during the
day and do loads of revision until seven
then you can actually enjoy your evening
and like see your mates and have fun and
have a bit of a rest yeah and what about
okay so obviously when we were doing
exams social media didn't really exist
if you were a teenager now we don't
really know where we're going by the way
if you know how would you deal with like
because I've seen a lot of people look
on Twitter and snapchat and YouTube when
do you allow yourself time to do that
like throughout or we've you give
yourself like a set time out good
question
I wish I could go back and do it again
so what I would do if you have your
timetable which you stick to do it in
blocks so you do like two hours in the
morning two hours in the effort like
let's say you did like nine til eleven
and then you had a half an hour break
and then you did 11:30 to 1:30 in your
11 til 11:30 break that's when you can
look at all your social media and
Twitter and then leave your phone your
iPad everything in the other room yeah
you can only do it in those allocated
time slots browser just it whole time
that's a good idea
there you go tips for revision hello
both me and Hannah want to do a proper
video together and I'd be saying for
ages that I want to do like a hair video
like how to start your hair when it's
curly and I thought it was a straight Oh
mind it's really bad yeah but everyone
says who told her that everyone was
commenting saying she looks like the
girl from that program in like alone or
something
basically yeah I didn't she was like ooh
good and I was like oh my god ha I
thought it was gonna be Jonathan curry
no good you have and also we gather fund
out Monday so it should be it another
vlog then we just get he lost them I'm
gonna go try and find this snappy snaps
seriously we're just walking on people
not from London don't realize this you
can get this in London right we're back
with more tips how knows like we should
do a video or a vision tips I'm like
this is it this is the bit is your
moment anyway she's sort of another tip
I thought you guys are gonna want more
tips because exams are going on for
quite a few more months I think okay say
gum so another tip I just fell off is
find someone who's just a little bit
cleverer than you and then you can
revise with them and then they really
push you to think differently so if for
example you're doing history or like an
essay based subject like English you
could like do
and you could like test each other with
like little cards and just sit opposite
on opposite sides of the sofa together
and you can test each other and then say
Oh have you thought of this oh but you
could answer it like that and it's
really good to develop your like essay
writing skills everyone has a friend
that's cleverer than them let's just
hope that friend isn't watching this
video every cleverer than me but in on
the day's I wasn't with her she actually
found a clever a friend I win a nighty
so I went around to my cousins the other
day and she's got her wall is covered
with tiny little post-it notes and it's
got like the question on one side and
then flick it under and the answers
underneath so sure like use it to test
herself that was pretty clever I like
very visual colorful things it is how
you work if you like visual colorful
things you could do for example if you
did I did lots of essay based subjects
because I'm really crap at things like
maths and the sciences but if you did
you could say like you have your essay
question you know which is usually
something like describe or compare and
contrast something and then you have
your question in the middle and you do a
massive spider diagram around it with
all your different points just like
bullet points all around it so it's kind
of everywhere and then you can just
number them and you can put them around
your house so that for example when
you're in the shower
yeah well brushing your teeth you just
have it and you're just looking at that
question and you've got all the answers
to that question on this one spider
diagram so good it's so hard I feel like
my school definitely they didn't tell me
how to revise sudden leaves exam season
they're like make sure you revise or
whatever that means so I hope these tips
are helpful to you guys because no one
told me at the time where did you learn
how to raise your brother yeah and my
school were pretty good telling me how
to rise good whether it was still lost
dry shave on your pretty outfit cuz it
really nice and summery
okay let's ignore the trainer's pretty
scary is that from this shop at nothing
Hill
okay a nice plain white tea just
plain white and these sunglasses are
from Bobby Brown's new collection at
Liberty I love them they're so cool I
really like they really suit you
Hannah's run off to see if that's a dead
child because I think it's just someone
sunbathing so she's convinced it's a
dead shot yeah not a dead child
it's a grown adult sunbathing now I know
the heat pretty well but we've properly
got lost I've never ever been to this
part in my life of coming here so nice
we're just talking we're not
concentrating so I think now we're going
in the wrong direction we're trying to
head down and let's hope you don't miss
Sammy's not closing snappy snaps finally
you made it yeah let's go get those DVDs
I got there man it was ridiculously
expensive came home now and it was so
nice having such a long walk with Hannah
we got so lost but it means that we
could just talk for ages we literally my
legs are killing me I got blisters
because we walked so far in like non
walking shoes but it was really nice to
catch up with her and I'm so excited to
watch my DVDs they'll hear and first of
all work I obviously have not spent any
officer noon at home so I need to do
some work and tomorrow's blogposts I
haven't scheduled yet I'm quite behind
on blog posts because of these daily
vlogs so I'm going to do tomorrow's and
Fridays that that's done this tomorrow
matter the meetings and then hopefully
watch one of my DVDs
do you know what's in this part I can't
believe this hair this Afra her this is
me two years later that's Iike just been
watching some of those DVDs and they're
so funny as I said I'm still friends
with all the same people so like Deb's
is in my fifth birthday party and
Hannah's there as well and my sixth
birthday parties like Keisha's there in
Deb's and Hannah and Deb I had a
swimming party for my sixth birthday and
that we're all in the pool played and it
just like the camera pans to Deb's and
she was just crying her eyes out on the
bench and her dad's trying to convince
her to get in she always hated serene
parties and so mean it was so funny I'm
gonna head downstairs now and I think
