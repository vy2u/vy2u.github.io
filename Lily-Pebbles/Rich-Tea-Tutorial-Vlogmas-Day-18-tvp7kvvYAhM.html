can't believe it's day 18 already that
is insane trying to think about it but
I'm I can't believe it's 18 already
crazy oh my god Christmas is so soon I
haven't even finished by her presence
and your plan for today is to go over to
my sister's house because for my New
Year's Eve video that I was talking
about yesterday I want to do a couple of
kind of baking cooking type things in it
and for those parts I think her kitchen
would be much better because it's she's
just had her kitchen redone and it's
really bright and pretty and white and
lovely and I also need someone else to
do the cooking and baking so that I can
film them I wish I could film it and be
in it myself but I can't so she's gonna
help me do that and I'm gonna film her
hands doing the baking so I'm gonna head
over to hers I think she just phoned to
say that she was gonna pick me up some
lunch so I'm gonna eat there hopefully
we'll get this all done while honey's
napping so that there aren't kids
running around screaming and that's my
plan so far maybe later this afternoon I
might see a friend of mine that's here
for a couple of days from abroad or if
not I'm gonna get some more work done
but this video I'm going to try and film
like different parts different days and
put it all together I need to find a day
where my house is quiet so I can sit and
film the videos where I need to talk I
know this is probably not that
interesting for you guys to hear but
it's just everyday life because anything
at these videos done so I'm just gonna
finish getting ready and then head over
to my sisters this is my camera bag that
I got from Amazon last year and I use
this when I have a lot of things to take
some taking my camera to lenses charger
and tripod and this all fits in this bag
okay I just have to stop on the way to
my sister's to pick up some cocoa powder
because they don't have any of that I'm
also gonna get some stuff to experiment
with a hot drink so apparently my sister
said the Bournville cocoa is the nicest
one where I got everything I need or
just basically loads of chocolate made
it's my sister's and she got me lunch
thanks honey
you
soon as you guys loves you so much
third film her again morning's easy
one-stop morning lunchtime so he keeps
cleaning the counter and then she keeps
jumping up on it again she's your friend
honey no she'll cat okay Jojo made some
brookey's yesterday and lock them up in
this little cellophane bag to give to
babies teachers bunnies tidying up the
kitchen for us so you can film just
setting up my ring like to add a bit of
light to the room Oh since I took a part
of it what early put my camera here
excuse me
okay I just sets out with the
ingredients here to film and I don't
think I'm going to show you guys much of
the filming so I want to ruin the video
so I need to run out get more castor
sugar because Josie didn't tell me that
she didn't have it enough so I'm gonna
run to the corner shop and get some and
then I think we're gonna get baking bro
it's done the first part of the baking
and the chocolate stuff is resting in
the fridge so we're gonna have a tea
break in the first batch of Dardan we've
got two more in the oven so sneak peek
of 9e years video oh look I wanted to
show you guys Bailey's comic book he
made this for his birthday to put in all
his friends goodie bag I do think I
mentioned this and loads of you guys
were mom said that's such a good idea
Jojo basically got him to make a comic
book and then she photocopied it and put
it norther going home back and so this
is a fun page that spider-man his
favorite and he wrote a comic book he's
only 5 by the way this is amazing like
any justifies
okay that's the Joker and like the evil
octopus yeah yeah shocked next page pow

that is the Ninja Turtle obviously and
then that's the spider-man say you in
the day this is a great comic thank you

long time because when you're filming
you have to keep stopping and starting
and moving the light but we're gonna go
pick up Bailey from school now he
doesn't know I'm going to get him so
he's gonna be very surprised and then
come back here and then I think my

edit today's vlog and the footage I
filmed at JJ's my mom was to say she
always reads the comments under my vlogs
as well so I can't believe how people
are from like all over the world so I
said that I asked you guys to comment
under this vlog telling me where you're
from in the world I think we'll both
find it really interesting to go through
and see see where you're from tell me a
bit about where you live thanks rich
sorry a tap was running yeah tell me
where you're from and what it's like
where you live especially around
Christmas time rich just announced that
he's making tea so I said wait can't
make tea without doing a rich team
tutorial because I promised everyone and
you'll commented on yesterday's vlog
then you'd love to see a rich tea
tutorial I did I have different OB to
mine but maybe I'll learn a few tricks
too so there how does it will begin rich
talked us through every step of the
perfect English cup of tea I want to
know cuz I'm actually never in here we
know ATT do use a filter
yeah okay oh it gets rid of the old
water I never do that whoops close it
with the filter
turns on the castle everything's normal
so far mugs very essential Apple office
so mimics birth drink English breakfast
what do you have you know it's not a
parable it's my mom has el grec someone
commented saying like Earl Grey with
milk I didn't know that was a weird
thing we've always had all that milk no
one in my house has sugar in their tea I
don't know why you just don't have to
need it really oh you know yeah what are
you having what's he you having licorice
dandelion and medicine okay you're not
very well are you okay Matt doesn't have
milk in it so now we just have to wait
for the kettle to boil stop boiling
listen oh you wait until it like it's
quieter yeah because it destroys to you
good tip okay so kettles gone quiet rich
loves my YouTube mug I don't like it
cause it's black it kind of scares me I
like to be able to see the true color of
my tea
okay wait talk us through what you're
doing spin it around inside so give it a
little spin yeah then let it brew for
how long I sometimes think you'd let it
brew for a little bit too long sometimes
but he's a bit cold oh yeah okay so you
stand here for four minutes
yeah we would be back in four minutes
guys okay we're back after four minutes
so give it another stir
didn't do that you just give it a little
study to actually strain it out stirring
it then give it another 30 seconds time
I'm a business we've run out of steam
and milk as well so we have semi skin
which is revolting I think that's what
normal people that work in said about
the mill yeah
Ian haste Nick from pixie Ruby's husband
was telling us about how skimmed milk is
actually really bad for you I don't do
you ever think it's good for me I just
like the taste better
anyway I believe it for that you take
let me do you guys so you take that out
wait I started crossed in there so I
always work my way how it's bought the
water really strainer and up a bit
strain it war so you could you make the
tea pretty strong yeah
strain use the front side of this tree
and I always use the back
whatever you want I've never analyzed
tea so much in my life
milk time - but yours milky you always
get the perfect color
that's good team good tea well done so
that's the rich tea tutorial done I'm
gonna have my cup of tea you go sit on
the sofa and that's today over so I will
