weekly vlog today is Tuesday hmm and I'm
in the airport again yesterday was a
very stressful Monday catching up with
everything but I'm off on a two-day
quick trip to Stockholm and I'm so
excited and going with a sauce and Ren
and I think is gonna be really nice
probably quite chilly but I've never
been before and it's somewhere that's on
my list of places to visit so looking
forward to doing that so I'll see you
guys when I get there okay so we just
got to the hotel I didn't really film
anything in between because actually all
editing three videos on the plane and I
was like I was like two hours to do it
didn't get them all done but I got a lot
work done so we're here we're sailing
the Grand Hotel which is amazing I don't
really know much about this trip I wish
I could tell you more but I do know that
it's Ren's 15th anniversary so that's
kind of why they're here work why we're
here they've flown people from like all
over Europe to come so few from the UK
few from like other countries so it's
gonna be really exciting I think we're
going on a boat tonight we're having
like a party and dinner got loads
planned but I've just walked into the
room it's beautiful there's like a
chandelier and then on the huge bed
there's a really cute light welcome gift
from Ren with all the travel minis that
you could ever need an itinerary fart
I'm here so I'm just gonna unpack a bit
I just basically bought loads of jumpers
with me and get ready because I think
we're going for lunch oh my gosh
look at the bathroom this is insane
round here is like dressing-gown and
shower huge mirror and like two sinks me
and Anna aren't sharing a read at this
time and at the most amazing deep bath
I'm definitely gonna have a bath tonight
I feel very lucky to be staying in such
a beautiful hotel room I'm just changing
clothes and freshening up for lunch I
was just saying to rich last night I was
I'm getting so good at this packing
thing now used to be terrible at it
so far I have forgotten any kind of plug
adapter so I can't charge my phone my
computer and I forgotten my mascara as
well which is really annoying especially
if I'm going out tonight so I'm gonna
have to go on the hunt for some mascara
cousin leave is something that you can
share so maybe I'm not so good at
packing after all so I'm here in
Stockholm for two days and then on
Friday it's Rich's birthday and I have
quite a few surprises planned for him so
I'm gonna vlog it so make sure you guys
watch the end of this vlog to see that
because he just thinks we're going out
for breakfast on his birthday he doesn't
realize all the surprises I have planned
here we're heading for lunch now and is
it just me or do you feel like it's
seven o'clock at night Oh get out for
dinner Blanche was delicious we're now
on the hunt from the star we have like
10 minutes to find bloody mascara and a
wig - Louis Vuitton Prada - Sephora so
I'm back in the hotel room we have
literally 45 minutes to get ready for
this like cocktail evening thing that I
don't have anything nice to wear for I
ended up buying the makeup forever smoky
lash mascara because I know it's quite
good
can't get it at home and it was a bit
much like cheaper than the functional
type mascara 'he's just halfway through
doing my makeup and I thought I should
show you guys my eyebrows I'm trying to
grow them out because I want to see what
that natural shape is like because I
always get them threaded and they do it
too thin look oh my god if card them
things go away with it why can't my mom
I'm gonna terrible can you see people
are gonna look at me and think that girl
is beauty blogger how the hell is she a
beauty blogger but I don't care
doing it for the brows I get makeup done
and now I need to do my hair okay I'm
ready I'm wearing this dress which I got
from a sauce it's river island brand
there and my shoes oh I don't know
Topshop maybe see we're going on a boat
to get to the restaurant and it says two
hours I'm very nervous because I get
really bad motion sickness I'm trying to
suck it up I'm not gonna talk about it
because even though it really helps me
to like express how I feel Anna's really
nervous about people throwing up so I
can't like talk about being nervous or
feeling sick it's it's a really terrible
terrible relationship thing between us
hope no it's not sick I'm really looking
forward to it anyway there'll be drinks
and dinner so I'm gonna go to Anna's
room now quickly to pick her up this is
Anna's room look how sweet it is yours
is more like pink and soft
all right let's go to the boat we're
both like high on travel sickness pills
hi guys I'm back at the hotel and I'm
already in my dressing gown it's like
half 11:00 and I'm so tired you woke up
so early this morning I'm just desperate
again the bath I'm feeling very lucky to
be in this beautiful hotel room but I
think I might end the vlog here will not
end the vlog here sorry I think I'm
going to stop vlogging today and then
start again on Friday when it's Rich's
birthday because I want so much fun
stuff happening then that I don't want
it to be too long ago vlog I think
tomorrow morning we're gonna head down
to the hotel spot and have a massage
would be so nice I love massages then
we're gonna do some work and then we're
gonna explore Stockholm a bit Stockholm
for a bit in the afternoon do bit
shopping browsing in the local area so
that should be really nice I'm now just
running a bar and I'm gonna use this
lovely red bath oil they put in my hotel
room so that should be really nice the
bath it's just so dreaming I will leave
you with this beautiful running water
tap and see you guys on Friday when
it'll be Ritchie's birthday okay guys
it's Thursday night now and annoyingly I
am not feeling very well at all
I haven't been well since I got back
from Stockholm but I wasn't that well on
the second day but we had found on the
second day we got to explore we did a
bit of shopping I actually bought only
bought socks which isn't that exciting
but it was a really fun trip and then
got back late last night and today's
been working I went Stuart shoots and I
also had to change some shoes at
Selfridges I had a voucher and I bought
some boots last week but they were the
wrong size and I just changed them
they're from dune and they look like
this I know I don't need any more black
boots but I thought these were kind of
smarter than other ones I own there's a
zip on one side they're really plain but
they're really good quality and I always
find June's shoes to be really
comfortable so I know that they'll be
easy to wear so it's Richards birthday
tomorrow I'm just wrapping his present I
thought I'd show you what I got him this
is the card I got today in Selfridges
which i think is kind of sweet and it's
also funny because rich can never spell
your rights it's just one of his
terrible habits
some night trainers when I was in New
York and some other bits and pieces I've
got home Reese's Pieces and some was
like random toasted coconut chips and
these are the trainers that I got him I
really hope he likes them I'm hoping if
he doesn't then he can change them here
huge feet ridiculous so yeah forgotten
some night trainers and I bought some
nice starry wrapping paper to wrap it in
he's got the day off work tomorrow so I
kind of have to take the day off as well
I might do a bit of work but we have
like a whole fun day planned and so much
of it is a surprise but I had to tell
you guys now tomorrow morning when I'm
with him I won't be able to tell you
because it's a surprise so he really
wants to go to duck and waffle for
breakfast and see the sunrise because in
the Heron tower which is really high up
yeah we have much Sun here I don't think
we're gonna see the Sun Rise but we
booked breakfast 7 a.m. which is when
they start breakfast and he thinks that
it's just me and him go for breakfast
well he doesn't know is that for like
months now I've had it planned that six
of our friends are going to be there to
surprise him when we get there so
they're all coming before work which is
so nice of them they're gonna come from
really early breakfast link off to work
he's gonna be so happy I just know it
he's really excited about going and he
thinks it's just us two and then we're
gonna have like a whole day together we
haven't we decided we can probably do a
bit shopping in town and then we've got
I'm gonna come home and get ready we've
got really early dinner at 5:30 at this
place with the palomar it's new and it's
meant to be amazing but it's so hard to
get a booking all they had was 5:30 so
we're gonna have a really early dinner
and then go out for drinks with some
other friends that couldn't come to them
for excess bit it's gonna be a busy day
I'll see you guys tomorrow
so it's 6:00 in the morning we were
asked at 5:00 these early morning starts
and not my thing seriously everything
too many at the moment but it's just bad
did you let your president I did thank
you go ahead with some trainers as I
told you guys we are now heading to you
for breakfast at 7 by 7 and that's the
time tables booked so gonna be there now
is like it feels like it's knight sabers
are we get see the Sun Rise
there is Sun in London but maybe we'll
see such we'll see the light rise
we just got to the street and it's still
the Hulk outside
walk to the herring tower let's go in
great so you have a nice breakfast yes
good surprise really good now it's time
to cover God it's still really early but
I want to try and find someone to get my
hair blow-dried because I fell too ill
to wash it last night and making it
efficient
hair's washed and blow-dried I'm feeling
a bit more human now nothing open yet
it's five to ten I think the night stars
gotta open I look like I'm in like New
York snowy are you having a good day so
far yeah that was the most unconvincing
yet ever actually when we were walking
back from the restaurant he was like
having this really like overwhelmed my
friends so then when I turn the camera
like me so we've just been shopping and
a few different stores and actually
bought a dress things are pretty smart
and I have nothing to wear it to but
whenever something comes up I always
think like I haven't got anything smart
so I think see as I found one that she
suits me I better get it just in case
you know it's Christmas hope you have
some parties and stuff it's pretty smart
though it's like red carpet dress we're
now on the hunt for some coffee so we're
gonna go into the ham yard hotel for a
quick cup of coffee
so we're home now and I'm just gonna
chill out because I'm feeling a little
bit peaky I miss the unsafe of my laptop
catch up with some work chill out and
then we're going out again for more food
this is probably the worst day for me to
be having all this food I'm kind of not
really eating we're going for an early
dinner at Palomar which was really hot
at a table at so today I'm gonna top up
my make up a bit don't know what I'm
gonna do add some concealer me my eyes
look nice spot some lipstick hey guys

vlog but we had a nice time in the bar
with friends but I was feeling really
ill I kind of just sat in the corner
shivering and today I'm just gonna stay
in and have a onesie day because I am
not feeling great sorry this has been a
bit of a Moni blog but that's just how I
was feeling so I'm gonna end it here and
