off what we're not ready yet in about an
hour we're gonna head off to Brighton
because we're it's the second part of
our B's chat live tour which is very
exciting
at the moment I'm quite sleepy this I
don't feel that excited and Anna's just
do her nails with Maximilian Strasser
converse at home yeah it's amazing I'm
kind of jealous I'm not wearing it I'm
wearing a kaberi am what you would be
wearing yeah I forgot it between marks
home from work today and he's making us
pancakes cuz it's Pancake Day
oh the Heather did that one looks better
yeah still got some holes here well we
do they look good have lemon and sugar
it's the only way on Pancake Day we're
just saying how we always have like
crepes tile pancakes on Pancake Day but
the rest of the year we have like
american-style pancakes I don't know why
for my favorites lemon and sugar what do
you have when you're selling
sometimes in the teller yes that's is
doing yeah I don't mess around
lemons yeah oh yeah okay I'm making my
pancake already sugar first apparently I
don't know if this is in every year
something that this year I'm doing sugar
first and then you can see how much
lemon I like the Jif stuff even though
it sounds like cleaning and washing up
stuff I think I change the language if
didn't that's it Thursday was sick the
claims that these people sit hey I used
to be called jiff and then they call it
C ok I'm gonna go to three right we're
on our way to Brighton and we have our
playlist on with 50/50 tea so I think is
actually longer than the actual journey
at the moment it's Nelly dilemma Murray
this is our Kelly Marie has a lemma we
had a year our Kelly ignitions
a good one
so we have a nice sunny drive down to
Boise you're currently listening to the
scene a gorilla or a genie in a bottle
I'm gonna try and convince Anna to share
this playlist we just need to figure out
a hat maybe you guys can hear this
amazing spot some aggravators just
finishing up with some Casey and Jo Jo
all my life just as I park right now
like so here at Sainsbury's we are at
Sainsbury's to pick up a birthday cake
because I noticed that quite a few
people were tweeting that they were
coming why do you people tweets are
saying they were coming to the first
bite in session and it's their birthday
like three people I was like what's that
so we're gonna get birthday cake so we
can sing happy birthday to these three
people whose birthdays it is today if
that's one of you then happy birthday
for last Tuesday we've gone for the
Minnie Mouse cake we decided that was
the nicest day I think oh great added
bonus and some candles for Anna's mom
some pretty tulips she likes them and we
have birthday cake and badge and stuff
supplies in there so now going to Anna's
parents house so we just got ready to go
to space and K store in Brighton I'm
wearing pretty much the same thing as I
was last week with this top a new Kat
Von D lipstick Anna's just doing her
hair I don't even miss understand how
you tie open in a car stay there oh it
kind of messes it up a bit more that's
good yeah you look great right now as it
is we're at the spacing hey Brighton Roo
let's go in yeah
pictured on our favorite product these
are all the goody bags for you guys
Anna's licking our little sign in a
scrapbook it's cool okay we're going out
for the first session and then I'll get
someone to vlog a bit of the second one
this is the cake in all its glory
I'm put up setting mini at the moment
and Anna found dotty candles to Matt
there's neither starry Avera but they do
you like bitter picked up it so we've
just done the first session and it was
so nice I keep saying that cuz the best
one yet but that was a really good crowd
first session Brighton you were great
you had loads of questions and there
were three birthdays we did the birthday
cake and we gave a little birthday
badges and I think they liked them and I
think like half a cake got eaten so
that's successful it's really nice and
we all sang and yeah really good group
looking 42nd one I don't think I'm gonna
be able to get anyone to vlog this
because there's not that many people
helping us this time around and they
were kind of busy so I just gotta trust
me when I say it was good and it's just
touching up her makeup did you enjoy
that I really enjoyed that I thought the
question and answered it was really good
advice and do you proud right and she
keeps going it's a homecoming tour
nearly forgot to finish my vlog but
brighten his chat life was really good
and we came home and heard massive
Domino's Pizza which was really nice and
I'm whispering even there Anna's parents
can't sleep yet but is feel really bad
like talking louder than this and Anna's
line of their recovery what we do we
like that watched each other's video
isn't it one who's okay and so can you
get to bed now and I speak two things in
the morning good morning we are just
leaving Brighton and heading back to
London because tonight we had a chat
line in London
we are carrying on with our amazing
playlist and to strive in home you had a
really nice time Bryson feeling
refreshed after applying and the amazing
host s there is Anna's mom right we got
back to Anna's and I'm now heading home
bye see you at 5:30
you know beasts we're looking forward to
London but now I've got like another
hour to drive home and then get ready
and have some lunch and go to hands
presents basically so I'm home and I've
managed to do a little bit of work and
have a bit of minestrone soup and now
I'm getting ready for London tonight umm
in Knightsbridge I'm just doing my
makeup what am I gonna do I kind of done
the same makeup throughout the whole at
this tour narshe glow I think I'm gonna
wear red lipstick because I am wearing
for my room is such a mess I think we're
gonna wear this cause top that I bought
on the weekend and I think stripes and
red lips are really nice too so that's
what I'm gonna wear probably my Sephora
lip cream I feel like I've worn red lip
throughout this whole school but it's
just quite easy like makes you look like
you've done good makeup even if you
haven't okay this is what I'm gonna wear
my Topshop Jamie black jeans which I
think I've worn to every single beauty
live event Pichette live event where I
haven't been wearing a dress this talk
which is from cause I really like it
give the stripy I love stripes and it's
got this kind of bit at the bottom that
makes it look like shirt a little bit
short for me it kind of shows the thighs
but I think the stripes would look nice
with a red lip which I'm gonna put on
right at the end feels really weird
getting ready at home for abuse chat
live event I haven't done this yet
oh god is a line down it from where it's
been folded I need to iron that really
can't be bothered maybe it'll go away
maybe no one will notice
