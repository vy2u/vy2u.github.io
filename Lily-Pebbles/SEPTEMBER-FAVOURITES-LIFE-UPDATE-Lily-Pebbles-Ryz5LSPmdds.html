feel super relaxed today because it's
actually a Saturday I filmed this
yesterday for you guys actually the day
before it's gone up and I never film in
a weekend so I feel really like relaxed
and we can be which is nice
also another disclaimer I've still got
like the end of a cold I've just been
away in Italy all week and I had a cold
the entire time which was very annoying
and then on the flight back you would
have seen if you follow me on Twitter my
ear got like blocked on the flight and
it's still blocked so I feel a bit like
funny and my voice is really loud in my
own head so sorry if I seem a bit weird
in this video so it is September
favorites time and as you can see from
the title a little kind of life update
I'm gonna start with the update because
I hate when people put those things at
the end of the video I am gonna be
taking some time away from the internet
I've never done it before but I have my
reasons and yeah I'm just gonna take
some time
offline I'm not going to be not working
I'm not going on a holiday or anything
I've got some other things to work on
and I'm just taking some time away from
the internet so I will be back shortly
just want to let you guys know I didn't
want to just like disappear without
telling you because of said disappearing
there's a couple of things I want to
tell you about this coming up in October
it's Breast Cancer Awareness Month and
there's a couple of things I'm working
on thank you guys so much for always
supporting me in the charities I work
with by the way I didn't if you saw on
Twitter and Instagram but Anna and I got
the total amount that we raised for look
good feel better and last year when we
worked with them along you guys you were
so supportive of course we did a
sponsored walk we did afternoon tea at
Liberty my sister did a charity sale
using some of the beauty products that I
get sent and obviously we made our
hashtag no makeup date and loungewear
for life jumpers can't remember the
exact total but we raised around 15,000
pounds but it could feel better which is
absolutely incredible so thank you guys
so much for that this year for breast
cancer awareness month I am getting
involved with one of the other charities
I work with which is copper feel I'm
gonna be at their festival which is
called the festive feel and it's an
amazing line-up the hosts are great
there's I think bustards playing there
there's gonna be so many things going on
I'm gonna leave the link down below for
all the information if you guys want to
get tickets and come see me there that
would be me
I'm gonna be on a panel I'll probably be
hanging around at the whole festival as
well and take a friend with me so that's
gonna be really fun I'm looking forward
to that also you might have seen
recently in one of my vlogs I worked
with Lawren from Castile London on her
titties so they're these really cool
t-shirts that she designs to raise money
as well and she's got some brand new
ones coming out she has the ones with
the words going across and she's also
got new ones coming out with like little
fried eggs and a little bee stings and
really really cool designs so I'm gonna
also lose some information and a link
down below I think those are coming out
like either today or in the next couple
of days and I reckon they're going to
sell out fast so if you liked those
t-shirts definitely check out the
description box I think that is all the
kind of life update stuff now I'm going
to get on and tell you my favorites from
the month I'm gonna start with like the
physical things I can show you and then
talk through some like TV favorites and
other things first of all this is a
funny one because it's not actually my
product I got sent this it's from German
owned it's their English oak and
hazelnuts cologne it's part of their new
collection and I smelt it but I
absolutely love this but it's quite
masculine their sense is definitely like
unisex but I smelt this and just thought
that would smell amazing or rich so I
gave it to him and I loved it he loves
it I love it every time he wears that
I'm like what are you wearing like it's
the Jo Malone one and it's so good it's
so nice if you have like a husband or
boyfriend you want to buy a new scent
this one is oh so good it smells like a
good-looking man when he gets out the
shower I really really love it talking
about shower me and rich both use this
actually we share it we have two and
there's another scent we have which is
more kind of almond E and I think which
prefers that one which is fine with me
because this is my favorite it's from
Soper duper which is a really cool brand
and it's the deluxe yuzu fruit and fake
body wash it definitely smells like fake
and I love the scent of fake so yeah
this has been our favorite body what you
have to in the showers the only ones we
use at the moment and it's really really
nice I think it's like yeah it's
formulated without plastic microbeads
parabens SLS all the kind of bad stuff
so it's just full of good things and
it's a really nice shower gel makeup
wise I've really been enjoying the
glossy a cloud paints and
I've got two shades here dusk and beam
dusk is more like a brownie color and
beam it's like proper orange but when I
met Emily Weiss she said she mixes these
together so I've been doing that put
like a little splash of each on the back
of my hand mix them together and then
Pat them on my cheeks I used my Real
Techniques contour brush to blend them
in and they're so nice if you like cream
blushes I think you'd really like these
of course you can mix them together I
hadn't even thought about it but the
fact that they're like little paint's
kind of implies that you should be mixed
in and create your own colors and I've
really been enjoying doing that dusk it
also works really well as a bit of a
bronzer - those are great I've also been
trying out the Charlotte Tilbury contour
wand and beauty light wand a lot of
people have been talking about these
they come any squeezy tubes took me a
while to work out the packaging you
basically turn it and then when you
squeeze it the product comes out of a
little sponge applicator at the end the
contour and it's probably my least
favorite out the - I really do actually
quite like it and you have to be into
cream contour products they're a bit
harder to work with a bit harder to
blend I think if you like a powder
contour this might not be for you but I
actually do quite like this you just
have to be patient with it but the
standout product for me is the
highlighter it's it's very highlighter
II actually am it's definitely not like
a subtle one of course it's a Charlotte
Tilbury product but it's really
beautiful like champagne II I don't know
if you can see that can you see like a
champagne E shimmery highlighter is
really nice if you like her contour
palette I think you'd like these
products but obviously they're the cream
version so really being impressed by
those these I actually just used this
morning I've never put a product in my
favorites video that I've used once but
I've read I was so impressed I was like
I really want to quickly get these into
this video it's from by Terry it's a
stylo steelo expert CLIC stic so they
are concealers they have this really
cool like teardrop applicator at the end
and then you click it and it comes out
and it's a cream concealer but they're
so nice it's a really good shape for
plying under your eye around your nose
on your chin and then they blend out I
use the sponge they blend out really
nicely and I didn't have to kind of keep
reapplying it was like the perfect
amount of coverage and I think this
might be my new favorite concealer so
excited I tried those right I just
whizzed through the beauty stuff this
kind of beauty maybe
I got said these they're the way hair
supplements I wasn't sure if I was going
to give them a go or not something weird
about like like taking a pill I don't
know I wasn't trying about it but these
are really interesting they sell them on
cult beauty and they this three there's
one for dry hair oily hair and thin hair
obviously I've got the ones for dry hair
thank you whoever sent these to me they
obviously know my hair and when I look
on the back it's basically mainly
vitamin D which I already take I take
the nutrient Lance d3 5000 because I
have to take those for many reasons it's
mainly vitamin D with a bit of vitamin E
and a few others it's kind of like kind
of like a multivitamin but then I also
notice that it's got MSM in it which is
the ingredient that Askia skincare use
in all their products which is going to
be really good for many things like
nails and hair and stuff so I gave them
a go I swapped them out for my vitamin D
just for just while I was doing these I
take every morning or night if I forget
i take my probiotics i have the optic
max strength probiotics and then I've
been taking one of these and I didn't
think it would do anything but I
actually think is really made quite a
difference to my hair I feel like it's
made it a bit like heavier and just like
better quality it's kind of hard to
explain but I've definitely noticed a
difference in my hair which is really
exciting they're about 25 pounds I think
and you get a month's worth you get 30
tablets so it's not cheap but it's not
like a fortune I don't know if you would
consistently take these like all year
round but if you felt like you know if
it was a summer we thought that the hair
was particularly dry you could just like
buy a pack of these and I'll put the
link below to the ones on top you see I
think they're quite interesting also
they sent me this little pill box which
I've really been enjoying because I
often forget to take my probiotics so
now I just put them in here there's like
different compartments for your pills
and it helps me remember
style-wise I have been loving the
ray-bans I bought in Stockholm I love
these so much I've already gone on and
on and on about them they are the round
ones with the gold rim and black frames
in the I always think it was 52 or 53
millimeters but I just think they really
suit me I always saw people like looking
around with these round song
then every time I tried them on I like
John Lennon and they were like so small
around and I reckon a lot of people have
these bigger ones which are a bit harder
to find but I love them I love them so
much so really happy that I kind of took
the plunge and got those when I found
them there is a massive ray-ban stone
coffin guard and I reckon they do them
if not online I picked up these online
and I showed you guys when I bought them
they are the Gucci loafers but with the
slingbacks I knew I wouldn't want the
actual shoes because I've got funny feet
and I just knew my toes would kind of go
through them but because these are the
slingback they allow more space for my
foot I feel like I could just push my
foot back this parts elasticated and
they're so comfortable when I first got
them I thought they'd be quite blistery
but they wore in like really quickly
they're very comfortable a lot of people
say that they're quite slidy so they get
it resold might have a mean slippery at
all but I should probably get them
resoled anyway just to protect them
I think the sling backs are quite hard
to find I got mine on a website called
my Teresa comm and if they're still in
stock I will link to them down below
I've had lots of compliments a lot of
people say like oh I haven't seen those
ones before I feel like they're really
nice for daytime with jeans but you can
also smarten them up in the evening and
I just love the breathing space I really
like having a look like the back of my
foot out is so comfortable so I'm really
glad I got those as well
one of the most random favourites and I
know everyone's gonna think I'm pregnant
I promise I'm not pregnant
I'm not trying to be pregnant but it is
an app that my pregnant friend told me
about funnily enough called squeezie
without going into like my health
history I've always had bladder problems
since I was a young teenager and Pilates
is really important and kind of looking
after my core and especially my pelvic
floor but I don't always have time to do
Pilates I'm really lazy and it's just
something that I always forget about and
my friend started using this when she
was pregnant because obviously looking
after your pelvic floor is important and
then as well and I thought oh my god
that is such a good thing that I could
start doing just to like help my pelvic
floor feel like I'm doing something even
if I can't do Pilates so that out it's
called squeezy it's like an NHS app oh I
thought it sounds like it's sponsored
it's really not and it's it's it's a
little like daily exercise plan and
reminds me every morning and evening to
squeeze if you've ever done like a
pelvic floor exercise you'll know what I
mean it's a bit of like an internal
squeeze and there's like a slow one and
a quick one you press play and it tells
you it's like squeeze squeeze but I just
feel like it's something I can do to try
and help strengthen my pelvic floor
without having to go to something like
Pilates and I don't know you guys are
worried about that or you suffer like
bladder problems like me maybe something
worth looking into another favorite of
mine is a TV show rich always makes fun
of me because I always say I don't want
to watch anything scary or anything with
guns or action that's really not my
thing I don't like watching TV programs
or films that make me feel anxious it's
just not enjoyable for me but then often
because we have such a small flat he'll
kind of be watching something and I'll
be doing work and then like without
meaning to I kind of start watching and
then I'm like who's that guy
what's that storyline and that
definitely happened with the walking
dead I started kind of listening in and
watching a bit on season five and then I
just got hooked and then we went away
and we've been watched like season six
and season seven so I've now watched
five six and seven and then I looked up
on YouTube for kind of season recaps for
one two three and four which actually
were really helpful if you kind of do
start midway through a series but the
Walking Dead is really good I really
liked it so weird because it's really on
me it's basically about zombies but
there's something about it I think it's
like the relationships and showing kind
of what humans do to survive I love all
the characters I'm totally hooked and I
can't wait for Season eight I think it
starts at the end of October and I think
it's great and it's so unlike me to like
something like that but I really highly
recommend it
we've been watching on Amazon Prime and
then Season seven I think we just got on
iTunes okay what was my other one oh
yeah last night and we watched the Lady
Gaga documentary on Netflix it's called
five-foot-two I think and it was really
good I am not even a massive Lady Gaga
fan I'm not not a fan I just not a big
fan and I really liked it and it was so
interesting to see kind of how she's
changed and grown she's now 30 so we're
like the same age and I cried in it it's
very emotional and I think it was just
it was really interesting seeing how
she's created her new album and it's
just the worth of watch like if you
I feel like you want to watch something
on Netflix I think it's definitely worth
watching by the way talking about not
being a fan I'm still annoyed that I
really got misunderstood when I was
talking about Rihanna and her fenty
beauty range one I didn't realize when
she was a surname I've asked a lot of
friends and they didn't realize either -
I said that her beauty range wasn't
aimed at me and I didn't mean anything
to do with like skin type or anything
what I meant was that the actual
products I went and had a look I was
really excited by the range but the
foundation was Matt and I don't wear Mac
foundations and then a lot of the
products like the highlighters were
really bright and glittery and colourful
and that's just not my thing doesn't
mean that I do I'm not interested in the
collection in general I actually really
want to go to Harvey Nichols and pick up
the contour stick because I think I
would really like that
and actually I want to try the
foundation now because although I
thought it was matte a lot of people
have tried it on camera and it looks
really glowy so I feel like I was really
misunderstood I was not talking about
anything to do with skin tone I
acknowledged that I think it's an
amazing range that it appeals to so many
different kind of skin tones and stuff I
just meant that some of the products
were my kind of thing it doesn't matter
who released them I don't wear like gold
glittery highlights or matte foundations
Oh YouTube it's so frustrating when you
feel like you're misunderstood anyway
I'm definitely gonna go check out fender
beauty when I'm in Harvey Nichols
because I think I'm gonna go back to
hirtius ins and this month and get my
color done because I have loads of gray
hairs so it's that everything I feel
like that all of my updates for now
please don't forget about me when I'm
having my little internet break I will
be back and I think it's gonna be good
just to have like a little bit of a hard
reset I hope you guys have a really nice
Sunday and a good week ahead and thank
you for watching
I'll see you when I'm back for my little
break bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
