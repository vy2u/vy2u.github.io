pukey
good morning everyone today is Saturday
the 10th of December and everything's
looking a little bit blue so where
there's a bit like gloomy today
but we've been really lucky we've had
such good winter weather it's been
really like cold and crisp but not wet
so I kind of expected rain at some point
I've got quite a fun day planned today
this afternoon I'm going to the VNA
Museum and I've had this booked for a
really really long time to go with Deb's
my friend and both our mums pink dabs
assisted Jenny's coming and then my dad
also booked yesterday to come we're
going to see an exhibition which i think
is based all around 60s and 70s maybe
science do the Beatles I'm not actually
entirely sure what the exhibition is but
I really like V&amp;amp;A museum so I think it
would be really cool and before that me
and Deb's are going to meet up at about
11:30 in town and we're going to have a
shopping day I've got so many Christmas
presents I still need to get and we
still do Secret Santa and my family but
we do it for my family and then rich
family also do Secret Santa and then me
and Richard doing presents for each
other and then me and my friends do
Secret Santa so I still have quite a few
presents to buy I need to sort out
Richard stocking badly so it would be
nice to hang with Deb's and go shopping
I've tried to write a list but some of
the things I just don't know what I'm
getting really I'm going to try and be
more positive and upbeat today because I
feel like my vlogs have been a bit like
down recently so hopefully today will be
a really fun day and I'll bring you guys
along with me I'm gonna have some Scotch
pancakes for breakfast I forgot we had
these and they went off two days ago but
I think they're fine this mother okay is
to have these all the time when I was a
kid it's just got back from the gym Oh
William I thought the day okay guardians
of the day knows I'm just intrigued by
this thoughts imagine if everyone had
trackers on them whichever we do their
iPhones beware that it tracks you
everywhere you go and then you can then
look and see what other people you come
in contact with or you pass and I bet a
certain injury like there's like one
person you pass like a hundred times in
a month and you don't even know that
person I used to see it I used to see
the same person on the cheap every day
when I went to it aren't you intrigued
who they are and how many times you've
seen
so many probably seen there more than
your family Wow wait what are you doing
today while I'm shopping there work
wrapping presents where are you hiding
these presents like I've had to hide all
my residence with him in the office and
he pretty much seen them no where are
you hiding your presents skills I've got
secret compartments billions this one
stayed in all day right baby yeah like I
could get some friends rich thank you
feel guilty up slow time yeah I'm in
town there's like a band playing
Christmas music sorry I'm here a bit
early so I'm going to head to
anthropology because I want to see if I
could change the hat that rich brought
me unfortunately it fits too small but
he bought it online and he bought it a
while ago so I might have to do a little
bit of convincing to let them forget to
let me change it we'll see I'm in
anthropology look how gorgeous these
toasters are and they've like a giant
one as well and we already love it
I'm just coming into Topshop to find
dance and I went out
and they were so impressed I knew how to
use the like Apple check out after
myself I bought so much stuff I'll show
you guys when I get home such an Apple
literally walking around looking for
ginger hair after riches thought of the
day's going to be so happy that I just
walked past the girls who I found the
truth with this morning I found dead
sisters here oh she needs help with coke
alright this is the top top version of
my coat the Zara ones sold out but
there's loads at the top top one try on
the puffer and then try on that one and
we'll see and I ate a recording so hot
alright this is this is the puffer okay
obviously doesn't go in there John
singing it's very there's four sides of
that see I think you should go over size
of the puffer I think at the point
personally especially like this time
around I think poppers are very
oversized oh they don't have that's
annoying I suppose that one is kind of
like a more croc style anyway I think
that size is better I do
I don't know pukey won't fit pukey okay
this is the so hot this is the Aviator
no I I think that's nice I don't know I
think you're cool enough to wear puffer
I think if you're going to get one or
the other I think puff is a cool this is
a bit too like everyone has it including
myself just found this one with the pink
hood and we're liking it so far
it's more puffery we both got really
hungry
so we've stopped shopping for a minute
to go and get some pizza we're going to
see if we get into Pizza pilgrims it
might be a queue but I've never actually
eaten there before so I really want to
try it right here's piece of pilgrims
let's go see if we can get a table we
finished at pilgrim and it was really
good I've definitely recommend it I
think Homeslice wins to me and it's
likely a memory sure why but they're
quite similar like sourdough pizzas and
it was so good I ate the entire thing
we're in beyond retro loving this Deb's
needs to buy her brother present I'm
pretty sure your brother doesn't watch
my videos so with a fish it's cool Chuck
I'm Justin Jessup's I'm taking out one
of these because it's a vlogmas
necessity also I've just spotted this
the man frosted blogger kit that is so
funny just be into American Apparel it's
so crazy in there apparently all the
stores are shutting down so it's like
70% of everything it's so weird seeing
school that's so like normally so
expensive like the proper sales shop so
I got some presents and now we're now
heading to Piccadilly Circus because
we're going to go meet our parents at
the V&amp;amp;A museum and racine a 60s terminal
is it about the Beatles just around the
same time it's quite a long and I can't
remember but it
or something and it actually really no
this is my friends exhibition it's our
friends exhibition I didn't even know
that till just now
I'm really excited and like the trip
with our parents yeah it's all it's all
six I think it goes starts in 1966 and
then there's like 70s I think and it's
all like music and our parents for
teenagers then so you're going to love
it
reminisce we are going to South
Kensington
I'm in the BNA and not sure I'm allowed
to film we're going to go find our
parents with their cueing somewhere
we've dumped a lot back so a little
headset things a headsets on and already
exhibition times very loud you said ouch
that's really loud can you just come out
of the exhibition and I really really
liked it I would highly recommend it
it's called you say you want a
revolution and you put headset on and
like it's it moves as you walk through
the music changes and there's like
videos loads of stuff about the Beatles
and like Twiggy models and stuff and
like all different kinds of awesome 60s
and collects 70s and it was really
really good I would really really
recommend going to do like them
you like it yeah it's really good like
there's like a main room named Emily
yeah they showed like Woodstock and play
the music they've been bags I could say
they're for Italy so I'm like I was born
in the wrong area and they should've
been a teenager but also our parents
like love because they were all fed
wheat me and definitely love with the
music from 60s and 70s like way better
than music now I was like perfect yeah
I'm home and money my shelter bar
because I've been on my feet since 9:30
no 10:30 this morning I've had a very
successful Christmas shopping Christmas
present shopping day and it was so nice
to spend some time with Deb's as well
and yeah my feet there are hot blisters
so I'm gonna buy myself a bar get clean
I feel really like chubby and then I
think min which staining tonight I'm so
excited about it literally back in the
day my Saturday night birthday weekend
would have been like at a bar or club or
somewhere with friends and staying in is
exactly what I want to do for my
birthday this year we are going out for
dinner tomorrow night with friends so
tonight we just want to take it easy and
I'm really excited I need to sort out
all my presence and I put them in piles
and then cover them with a throw cuz I
have nowhere to hide them all so I'll
show you what else I got today I'll do
like a little mini haul oft at my bath
though although actually the boss takes
so long to run our Turkish food is on
its way getting new breats
so here okay I'm gonna quickly show you
what I bought for myself most of things
I would say a present I got this little
tripod from Manfrotto and everyone at
the gleam Christmas party had one of
these it's like the vlogmas accessory I
don't think I'll use it all the time
that's our doorbell some people hold
this and use it to vlog I think I'll use
it more when I need like a stand because
basically this top part it swivels if
you click that button and you can direct
the camera where you want it to face and
it's pretty genius I've needed to run
these for ages I had a Gorillapod but I
wasn't happy with it because I found it
really flimsy and it kept kind of
falling over so I think I'll be happier
with this one I also got a few things
from the Apple Store this is a pen
holder for my Apple pencil and which I
think it's genius because I keep I was
actually saying to Claire the other day
that I feel like I'm going to
I feel like I'm going to lose the Apple
pencil so this I can just put my desk
and like put it in there so that's great
I also got an extra long lightning to
USB cable so this is the cable that
charges your phone
another Claire inspired purchase
actually all of these things I'll
Clara's bad purchases extra long cable
so handy so you feel like lying in bed
or somewhere where you're not near a
charging point you could it can reach
and then this is a travel a world travel
adapter kit so were these are four
different places around the world for my
laptop charger which would just make
things so much easier especially as I
always run out of travel adapters so
very happy at my techie purchases today
we went for Turkish food tonight so I've
got lots of chicken and lamb and rice
and veg mm-hmm
smells good I went for chicken and rice
well we got lots of like dips going on
here homers which ones got is that the
aubergine yeah with some salad rich went
for lamb and rice thank you oh and is
that all bread over there oh by the way
so many of you commented saying that the
Olympus camera lens isn't blue that you
peel off for the blue so I'm really
excited to go do that off the dinner
because I genuinely thought the lens of
blue really made me long this is so
delicious oh my gosh this is so exciting
I'm such an idiot I really didn't
realize like it peels off wait look oh
my god so much better I still think the
lens be black release isn't blue so
