sorry I missed last week's upload but a
couple of things before I get started
first of all thank you guys so much on
your amazing comments on my small room
renovation video because I loved that
video so I'm so glad you guys did too
there literally wasn't one bad comment
and I really enjoyed reading through the
comments hearing your suggestions and
your kind of renovation experiences so
thank you so much I will link the video
up here I think so go and have a watch
if you haven't yet also thank you guys
so much for all of your support on my
book F word it made it to number six in
the Sunday Times bestseller charts which
means that the book is officially a
best-selling book and I can officially
say I'm a Sunday Times best selling
author which is insane so thank you so
much
I couldn't have done it without all of
your support so thank you in today's
video I'm gonna be talking about skin
because as most of you probably know if
you follow me on other platforms my
skin's been doing some crazy things
recently it all started with the lip
allergy about a year and a half ago and
that kind of spreads to my eye eczema
and I've seen multiple doctors and
bottom line is I've just become a bit of
an expert allergy person often it will
be kind of an underlying thing and a lot
of my family have it and something will
happen to just kind of bring it to light
and then that's it you've got it so I've
been just figuring out how to look after
my skin obviously it's been really cold
and snowy as well so my already dry
dehydrated skin has just been extra dry
and dehydrated I also had a little thing
when I went to Miami where I had laser
and then went into the Sun which you're
not supposed to do I obviously wore SPF
but then had a facial with a brand that
I've never tried before and my skin just
went nuts basically it was a series of
bad decisions and I ended up with like
really spotty cheeks which I just have
never had you guys know I've never
really suffered from spots I've always
had dry skin but not kind of spotty skin
so I was like what the hell I don't have
I know any makeup that's appropriate for
covering sports I didn't have any
skincare and my skin was just freaking
out and I didn't know what to do so it's
taking me a while to get into a little
bit of a routine but I think I've got it
down for now and I'm gonna show you the
products I've been using this doesn't
mean that I'm never gonna use that other
products I love you know the Oscar
renascence
mom and the Hardy cleansing balm all of
those products I still love them it's
just for now I'm having a little bit of
a break and I'm really enjoying using
this small kind of simplified edit of
products most of them if not all of them
are fragrance free and very simple
calming products great for if you have
sensitive skin if your skin is just
freaking out and having a moment I
thought this might be helpful to some of
you guys massive shout out to Caroline
hyerin's my good friend who is always
there to help me with skin care
questions and also to Nadine Baggett who
has been so helpful she recommended an
amazing lip balm that's really helped my
lips and I'm just always DMing her with
questions and she really really knows
her stuff so if you haven't already go
check out her channel I will link
Caroline and Nadine down below in the
description box so I'm gonna get started
and talk you through my current routine
as I said I'm trying to keep it as
simple as possible
nothing crazy very quick and very gentle
on my skin first up is the Clinique take
the day off a bomb when my skin first
started freaking out I was thinking what
cleanser am I going to use all of my
favorite cleansers are so luxurious and
they're so heavily scented I was using a
home of what it's called but it's like a
really basic cleanser and I just kind of
found it boring I find when my products
are not enjoyable to use it makes me not
want to do my skincare routine and then
Caroline reminded me of the Clinique
take the day off balm which I have like
three of these in my drawer but I forget
that these are fragrance free and just
really gentle on the skin so it's just
like my other cleansing balms it looks
like a solid balm I just scoop out a
little bit and it completely melts into
the skin this can take off all of your
makeup which is amazing I tend to take
my eye makeup off separate anyway using
the Clarins eye makeup remover but if
you would like to if you're not wearing
much makeup this does take off your
makeup really well so I just completely
rub that into the ski and give myself a
little bit of a facial massage it turns
into a kind of oil and then I just
remove it using a warm damp muslin cloth
I really really love this cleanser I
find with this I don't need to double
cleanse but of course you can if you
would like to so this has been the
cleanser that I've been using and it's
such a good one I really would recommend
this to anyone any skin type most days I
keep my routine really simple but around
once a week I've been using a mask not
so much anymore but when my skin was at
its worst
I really enjoyed using this mask it's
from a skin suit acorss which is an
amazing brand it's very science based so
I get that it's probably not the most
glamorous brand but their products
really do deliver they can be a little
bit pricier but I swear everything I've
tried from them has been incredible
this is the phyto corrective mask and I
was on a press trip with them and
Caroline pointed it out she was like you
need that because that was what my skin
was really bad so I've been using it and
I really like it comes in this little
glass jar as you can see it's a green
mask it's got some really lovely common
ingredients in it like cucumber is a
very refreshing gel mask it has got a
little bit of scent in I think but
because I wash it off I kind of allowed
myself to use it because it's not just
gonna like sit on my skin so I basically
layer this on it's a very cool a that
gel mask as I said my leave it on for
like 10-15 minutes as long as I can kind
of be bothered and then I just wash it
off I really felt like it did calm my
skin down it calmed down the redness at
that time when my skin was the worst
every mask I was using was just burning
and stinging my skin so this completely
did the opposite it just calmed it down
chilled it out and it felt really lovely
on the skin so that's the mask that I've
been using once a week maybe once every
two weeks I cream is actually one thing
I didn't need to change up because I was
already using the LA roche-posay
Colerain ultra contour eye cream the
longest name ever this is just a really
lovely eye cream I tried quite a few
over the years I find that this one is
it spreads the easiest I like quite a
wet eye cream I don't want more I feel
like I have to drag my eye area so I
tend to just start using my ring fingers
because they are the lightest touch
that's that's why everyone always uses
their ring fingers and I just tap it
around my eye area I feel like with this
one I can't get quite close to the eye
and it really hydrate to the area as
well and I go because I've got this
eczema around my eye I also have to use
certain kind of eczema creams as well in
the evening but this eye cream I use in
the morning and it really hydrates the
eye area before I wear any makeup which
tends to really kind of take up around
my eye and
which is quite annoying so that the
lovely eye cream you can get that at
like boots and then this theorem is new
into my routine this was a
recommendation from Anna I'm sure you
guys know Anna if not obviously I've got
a channel down below as well it's the
Anna edit and she kept going on and on
about this she picked this up at the
press trip that we went to with
skinceuticals and I didn't get it
because at the time I was just getting
all the kind of sensitive skin
phyto corrective range stuff but she
completely loves this so I thought I
would give it a go it's @h a intensifier
and it basically boosts the hyaluronic
acid in your skin so I've used serums
like this before and other ones I like
that maybe more affordable or the glossy
a bounce serum and the ordinary
hyaluronic acid a comment what it's
called they're both very wet and it's
quite like instant moisture or as I feel
like this one is a little bit more
complex it's got this like it's in a
funny a purple color and it's a little
bit thicker and it feels like it's doing
more I mean I think the ingredients are
more complex and I've really enjoyed
using this I just put a little bit into
my hand and then kind of rub it into the
skin and really take my time to massage
it in it leaves my skin for you way more
hydrated but I also feel like it's
fighting a bit of anti-aging whilst it's
doing it and I've only been using this
for around three weeks now but I can
definitely feel it difference in my skin
and I really like it it's so expensive I
actually got this one sent to me by the
PR but I would definitely buy my own
again when it comes to moisturizers a
lot of my favorite moisturizers had
really strong scents in them or a bit of
kind of retinol and they were making my
skin feel a little bit sore so Caroline
actually recommended this is the
Clinique CX soothing moisturizer I've
never heard of the Clinique CX range
before not entirely sure what it stands
for but she said to me this is the
perfect moisturizer if youwant saying
that's kind of fragrance free but you
want it to be really thick and hydrating
and do everything you need it to do so I
was really excited and I really like it
it's just a normal kind of white
moisturizer but it's thick it makes your
skin feel really hydrated I love to just
like slather this all over my face
I've been using it morning and night it
really hydrates the skin I haven't got
about
I'd say about it I think even when my
skin kind of goes back to normal this
would definitely be my go-to moisturizer
from now on because it does everything I
need also I really like the packaging
it's not too big it's not too heavy very
impressed I'm sad I didn't even know
this existed
the final step when I know I'm going
outside I don't wear SPF every day if
I'm staying in but if I'm going out I
like to put on a bit of SPF and I'm just
using the same one at the moment because
it seems to be alright on my skin it it
doesn't make my skin feel sore or
anything it's the glossier invisible
shield daily sunscreen I like this one
because it's not a cream it doesn't kind
of feel too heavy but it's not a really
kind of silica silicon gel it's
somewhere in between I feel like it
glides on really easily
it feels lightweight on the skin and
it's SPF 35 which I think when you live
in the UK is good enough for me so that
is my final step when I know I'm going
outside so that's my current skincare
routine as I said really simple
streamlined and it's helping my skin's
so much it's so nice to see my skin back
to normal seriously my cheeks were just
covered in spots and it just felt sore
and I didn't know what to use so I'm
really enjoy this can carry team at the
moment and I thought if you guys have
sensitive kind of saw stressed out skin
maybe I can just help you by giving you
the recommendations that all these
lovely people gave to me now that most
of my book promo commitments are done
I'm really looking forward to getting
back into making content again I feel
like I've been a little bit out the loop
for the past few months so I'm sitting
down and brainstorming new videos today
if you guys have any ideas if you have
any specific videos that you want me to
film or if you could let me know your
favorite videos that you like to watch
of mind that is all really helpful I
want to get back into blogging a little
bit as well I'm speaking to my friend
Jay about just redesigned my blog
nothing drastic just kind of simplifying
it because you know I haven't done in
three years and I feel like blogs change
all the time the way people like to read
them so I just want to do something a
little bit more basic where you guys can
just scroll through posts and it's
easier to read so looking forward to
doing that at some point and next big
project is the house which I can't wait
for I'm gonna be sharing it in vlogs on
Instagram and probably everywhere okay
I'm gonna stop rambling thank you guys
so much for watching and I'll see you in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
