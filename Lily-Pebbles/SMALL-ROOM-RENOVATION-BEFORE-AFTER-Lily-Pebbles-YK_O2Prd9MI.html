really well this is such an exciting
video because it's another renovation
video and thank you guys so much for
your lovely comments on my house tour
video if you haven't yet seen it I will
link it up here I think I showed you
around my home and talked about our
renovation plans and there were so many
really nice supportive positive comments
also loads of really amazing like
renovation tips so thank you so much for
those this is going to be another
renovation video and something I've been
planning and working on since the end of
last year so I'm so excited that I can
finally share it with you this video is
actually sponsored by Dulux
and they got in touch to offer to work
with me on renovating one of our
bedrooms and it's been such an amazing
process as you guys know we've got this
house that we're kind of slowly working
on how we're going to do it up and I
kind of have plans for each room but
this room that I'm currently in is the
smallest bedroom in the house it's the
one next to our bedroom and it just
doesn't really have a purpose let's be
honest it's probably going to be a baby
room one day but until then it's just
kind of a bit of a sad pointless room
that has no use to it we were using it
to just kind of store stuff that we
didn't know where else to put it which
had his gym gear in like big plastic
boxes I had a bit of camera gear in here
it just kind of became like the dumping
room so I really wanted to focus on this
room and give it a transformation and I
think that's what's so exciting about
painting a room is that it really can
transform it so easily there's just like
a lick of paint she looks really are the
expo in color and they have such a huge
range of paints so I really thought
about what we wanted to gain from this
room and I decided that it'd be really
nice to turn it into a little bit of a
snug like a nice relaxing space that we
can use for both storage but also just
for hanging out in if you want to read a
book watch a film maybe have a bit of
like offline time it would also be great
to double up as a bit of spare room for
when friends stay over or any of my
nephews or niece
Sherlock's do this thing when they have
a colour of the year which i think is
such a great idea because kind of home
decor trends can be quite overwhelming
so it's really nice to see what the
colour of the year is and this year for
2018
their color of the year is heartwood I
have a little peeko I have a little
sample right here these like one of the
little mini rollers that you can use as
a tester it's a matte paint and it's a
really gorgeous like warm neutral but
with like a hint of Heather and I really
like the color because I think it's kind
of like an interesting take on a gray
because it's slightly warmer like I said
it's got that hint of Heather in it so
it works really nicely with other pastel
colors with pinks which I really love
pink
with blues with greens I tested it out
and it really seemed really versatile
but it definitely has that warm cozy
homely feeling which I really like in a
house so before I start this video which
is definitely going to be a very long
video let me quickly show you what the
room looked like before okay so this is
the room next to our bedroom is the
smallest room out of the three the doors
are really nice original doors I think
maybe one day we might paint them not
really sure also might change the
handles ease I think like original
handles haven't quite decided but for
now these are all gonna stay so this is
a little look at the room as a whole
obviously the wallpaper I mean I think
some people would like this is a bit
like all Akili like it's a bit much for
me I'm not massively into all paper so
it's got this wallpaper everywhere and
then all of the woodwork is this like
funny yellowy color let me see if I can
find a better example this is the window
so kind of mustardy yellow which I'm not
a massive fan of at the moment we have
like just some of my filming stuff they
can quite fit into my office anywhere so
I've got some tables that I use these
are some old IKEA drawers from our old
bedroom I've got some like files on top
I haven't figured out a good filing
system yet and then in here I've just
got all my kind of like camera equipment
and stuff so if I look back at the door
there was this big wardrobe mic here
that was here when we moved in it's
actually secured onto the wall and the
moment we just have like spare coats and
like which suits and stuff in there and
then if I just turn we've kind of got an
ironing board and something like workout
stuff for rich and his work bag and
stuff also these really lovely curtains
I'm not a fan of these they're like
shiny stripy cut
the carpet we're gonna have to keep for
now this kind of goes there are all the
bedrooms upstairs I think one day we
will redo it but it's fine for now it's
just kind of like a a gray carpet and
also this lampshade eventually we
definitely want spotlights throughout
the house but again that's something
we're gonna have to do and we probably
do it up so for now I'm probably just
gonna find a nicer lampshade to go there
so this is an overview of what the room
looks like then it was time to prep the
room that involves taking down the
built-in wardrobe and just removing
everything from the room including the
curtains which were just file which is
tearing down wardrobes gonna nice then
it was time to strip the wallpaper which
was something I was very excited for day
one update and all the wallpaper has
been stripped in this room very exciting
I absolutely loved seeing like the
different stages and seeing the room
come together the paint looked beautiful
just after the first coat this is what
the room looks like in daylight I'll
turn the light on really really happy
with the color I think it looks really
nice now we're gonna start filling the
room up and decorating so I've been
planning for quite a while what to do
with this room and it's definitely not
like a quick overnight thing I've been
saving photos on my Instagram making
mood boards and just looking around at
all my favorite shops that I know they
stock things that I like one side
thoughts of the bigger items I wanted in
this room I used tape to kind of map
them out what I've done in here is I've
used masking tape to kind of map out
where things are going to go so I can
plan it a bit before I buy them so these
will be the shelving units from Ikea
this would be where the bed will go and
then I've also started mapping out the
gallery wall so that I can order the
right size prints and that's actually
been a really helpful process for me and
then it was just a case of ordering
things and making sure when they arrived
that they were right for the room and I
really liked the idea of having
everything all together in one place and
then do
in the room if that makes sense so the
first thing we wanted to do was this
gallery wall here and I ordered all the
prints from dicenio-- and I've logged
the day that we created this gallery
wall yeah my massive delivery from
dicenio-- I think that's how you
pronounce it it arrived I ordered one
two three four five seven prints I think
I want to do some kind of gallery wall
I've never done a gallery wall before
but I spent quite a lot of time picking
prints I thought would go really well
with the walls and then actually what I
did is I planned it out on my computer
so I used pages let me show you so I
kind of planned out the positioning of
the prints and I also measured them on
the wall to see if they would fit well
so I know that that's what I'm aiming
for
so I'm gonna unpack all the friends um I
think the prints are the frames come
separately I ordered extra frames as
well so I'm going to put all print into
the frames and then rich and I are going
to try hanging them hopefully in the
right place and the right order on this
part of the room here
so all the prints are framed I
definitely went for a relaxing a calm
theme so water I really like that kind
of simple pencil drawing really really
love that one some palms with sort of
pink which I thought would go really
nice with the paint this one's like
feathers and it says dream this one is
another palm print and then black and
white palm trees because I love this one
it really reminds me of the Hotel
California album I'm really really happy
with the prints and now I can't wait to
put them up on this section of the wall
I mean the prints is proving more
difficult than we realized there
definitely needs to be more guides to
how to hang prints on a wall but I think
we finally got there in the end I think
it depends on like what's behind the
wall really but hopefully this is kind
of work
so divorce has been discussed a couple
of times but eventually we did it anyway
we got there in the end that looks
really cool I'm really happy with it
they're not all perfectly straight
there's a bit of unevenness going on you
know this is real life and this isn't a
showroom it's a home so we I'm
absolutely fine with that but just like
you should all be to straighten them I
really think it's fine I think it looks
really cool all right let's move the
ladder so we can actually see what it
looks like
okay the next step is the IKEA stuff we
have got the calyx that's what it's
called I've got six like a two I'm like
this and then one with six I'll show you
when they're built but these are gonna
go in this corner here we need to also
be able to use this room for storage
because rich keeps his gym gear in here
I keep my camera equipment in here so
something that we could style up and
make it look nice but they could also be
really practical at the same time
building commence
you almost did everything right but the
these holes meant to be at the back so
we're just going to fill them but that's
one up we're gonna have another little
two here I really like how the color
comes to on the back but I'll show you
what I start filling this what we're
gonna be using it for oh this is so
exciting and it looks great so we've
done the idea of stuff as I said this is
a 1/8 one and then this is a two and I
thought it'd be really nice when you
walk into the room to not just have it
so like suddenly there so instead you
kind of walk into this section and here
I could put like some vases or a plant
or something I just thought that would
be a good idea and I'm happy it worked
what I was visualizing definitely works
I've started filling it up these boxes
are all from Ikea and this is very rich
it's gonna put his gym stuff and then I
bought some of these for me to put my
camera equipment in again it will form
IKEA but now is the fun part where I
kind of style these shelves and figure
out over the next week or so what
exactly I want to put on here this is
one thing I have so far which I thought
was fun and you can change the letters
the next thing we're gonna do is put the
blinds up there were some really heavy
like satin curtains in here and it was
just too much for such a small room so
we took those down I was contemplating
putting up some like thin sheer curtains
but I really found any I liked so
instead we're going for some wooden
blinds which worked really well in our
last flat and made the rooms feel much
more spacious so they're just white
wooden blinds from wooden blinds direct
I think I'll link all the websites that
everything that I've bought for this
video down below in the description box
but yeah which is gonna put those off
now truthfully it works and they look
good
as I said we wanted to be able to use
this as a spare room a little snug for
when the kids stay over but I didn't
necessarily want it to be like a
permanent bedroom so I thought it'd be
really great to get some day beds and I
found someone Urban Outfitters they were
a little bit pricey but totally worth it
I got two so that we could also make a
double bed and it's so comfortable if
you use it as a single because it's like
two really squishy beds but I love these
because they can roll up and we can put
them in the loft so we can put them in
another room if I want to use this it's
more like a filming area or for anything
else so these are probably the biggest
investment for the room but they work
out so well these are the day beds I got
from Urban Outfitters they actually look
much bigger than I thought but I got
this kind of greeny minty one and a
beige e one which I think was meant to
be pink I don't know it's kind of hard
to tell so I'm gonna lay them out now
over here and see what they look like
these are what the day beds currently
look like they are very very comfortable
and I like how they can roll up and
there's this velcro thing if you want to
put Norway because I think sometimes I
might have a chair here so I can film so
we put one on top of the other one
because it's comfy but also if we want
two people to stay we can put them next
to each other and it becomes more of a
double bed but also this is just great
for a little chill-out area if we wanted
to watch films or read a book or
anything like that I've thrown this on
top which is a throw from H&amp;amp;M and I
think that kind of brings back in the
pink and the purples as obviously the
green is quite different to the wall
color but I also kind of liked it it's
definitely got that kind of cactus Eve
I've got this cushion from Urban
Outfitters and I want to get a couple
more cushions just to make this little
area more comfortable but for now this
is what this little corner looks like
and yeah I think I like it definitely
comfortable rich to on chest out oh yeah
comfy yeah I've also changed this to
welcome to the snug which I thought
works really well I've got this which
I'm gonna be hanging maybe tomorrow lots
more to do in this room but for now I
think we've done pretty well you're
definitely gonna use this as your
chill-out room aren't you so then it was
just a case of the final touches which I
think really makes the room so I'm so
excited to now finally show you the
finished room I'll give you a little
tour and talk you through all the
details as I said everything
be linked below in the description box
if you want to take a look so as you
walk into the room its instantly
brighter now that we've got rid of the
curtains and straightaway you see the
IKEA shelves that we got I'm so happy
that I did this kind of step thing that
I was thinking of because then you're
not greeted by this kind of giant wall
straight away so the first thing you
kind of see is this little leaf tray
which I got from H&amp;amp;M home not entirely
sure what I'm gonna use it for yet but I
just think it's a really nice piece of
decoration and above it is this mirror
also from H&amp;amp;M home I really like this
because it's light enough that you can
just hang it with a nail on the wall but
I wonder to have a mirror here both if
someone stays the night it's nice to
have a mirror in your room and also if I
film in here it's really handy as well I
love the shape of this one it's gold and
I think this is a really good find so if
you look at the IKEA shelves from the
front as I said before I love how the
paint shows through at the back I think
that's a really nice touch
at the top I've got this little treasure
chest from Oliver bonus which is
actually what I keep my printer
cartridges in but you'd never know and
it's very pretty from the outside and
next to that I have a hanging ivy plant
I really wanted to have some plants in
this room just to add a bit of kind of
oxygen and life and I think real plants
make such a difference in a room
especially in a bedroom this little
plant pot I actually got from home
scents and the matte past or green
watering can next to it is from hmm home
and this both looks cute and will also
remind me to water the plants so just
looking down a bit I've got the lights
which I actually changed - welcome to
the snug you could obviously turn this
on as an actual lights and I think it's
really nice if guests do stay I think it
will make them smile and then just to
the right this kind of cube is more just
for deco reasons this tray and the
little kind of matte jars I think they
are they're all from HNN home and the
candle is from all over bonus I think
the muted kind of pastel tones go so
well with the pain I'm so happy I found
these I think they looked really small
and they also look a lot more expensive
than they actually are just below that
I've got a load of books which actually
I was just keeping in the loft because I
didn't have anywhere for them to go so
I'm really happy that they've now found
a home these are mainly beauty and
fashion
books and I think they look great here
on the shelf and then got my IKEA
baskets I really love the dotted print
and these are perfect for keeping my
camera charges and any sort of kind of
techie bits like that just below that
I've got our files these are just our
kind of home finance boring admins stuff
but they look really nice in these files
which are from Paper Chase and then also
my photo albums which are from Paper
Chase then I've got some more storage
from Ikea where I keep my camera's I
really liked this sort of gray felt box
with the gold detail in it just looks a
little bit smarter and then on the
bottom row are just three plain black
storage boxes from Ikea and this is all
for rich to keep his gym gear in the
wooden blinds worked really well to add
more light into the room and then in
this corner I really wanted to add
something different because the beds are
so low I really wanted to play with kind
of heights in this room and I knew that
having something hanging from the
ceiling would be really nice just to
balance out how low things in this room
are so this hanging planter is actually
from Urban Outfitters we had to buy an
extra chain to make it longer but it was
so easy to do and then rich just put a
little hook in the ceiling and hung it
from there
the plugged inside I just got from my
local garden center and I actually think
this is one of my favorite things in the
room I love it so then we have the beds
which as I said a super comfy I've got a
green one
and a beige one we've just laid them on
top of each other we can always lay them
next to each other if we want to make a
double bed and on top of just throwing
this hmmm throw which I already had it
didn't really have a home and I think it
works really well in here the pinks and
the greens and the kind of Heather on
the walls I think they all tie in so
nicely I've also got a few cushions on
here you saw the cactus one from Urban
Outfitters the other two are from H&amp;amp;M
home and I like how they are a bit more
textured I think that adds a nice
different feel to the bed next to the
bed is a little bedside table which I
can't really remember where this is from
I think it might be H&amp;amp;M home but it's
something I've had for years maybe it
was all over bonus hmm I'll try and find
out for you and on top I've just got a
general own candle my Soho home mug
which I'm obsessed with and a little
coaster which I think is from West Elm
and then above the bed is the gallery
wall which you guys have seen and I'm so
happy with how it
came out I'm really glad we went for
all-black frames I think it's really
striking against paint on the walls I'm
so happy with all the prints I just
think it looks great
so it turned out very well after just a
little bit of arguing just to finish off
the room I haven't yet shown you I also
changed the light this is the sort of
cage light which I got from Ikea and I
think it goes really nicely with the
frames from the gallery wall and the
sort of geometric vibe that the mirror
kind of has and the files kind of have
and should try to hide things and
together but I think it's very simple
and I think it looks really good so that
is the entire room transformation and as
I said I'm so excited by this video so I
really hope you guys enjoyed it please
let me know what you think of the whole
room transformation what you think of
the paint let me know if you like this
video thank you to Joo Lux for
sponsoring this video and if you guys
want to get more room inspiration
there's a load of ideas on the Dulux
website so I will link that down below
in the description box thank you guys
for watching and I'll see you again soon
