is going to be a chassis makeup tutorial
or not that chassis I just filmed it I
feel like I was quite quiet
anyway it's of this makeup look which is
kind of like a line look pink look and I
wore this a lot last year in December a
lot of my videos I was wearing this eye
lip combination and so many who were
asking what I was wearing so I've had
this video scheduled in for quite a
while I'm glad I finally got around to
filming it I really like the purple
pinky tones it's a little bit different
but then still quite safe at the same
time I'm using a few new different
products but also some old school
favorites as well so please keep
watching if you want to see how to get
this look and I really hope you guys
enjoy it so I'm giving this natural
light thing a go after my honeymoon haul
video so many of you guys said you
really likes the natural light I don't
normally film this way because I think
that my sofa is a bit of a boring
background and I prefer having my
shutters behind me but the clear this is
a makeup tutorial I thought I would give
the natural light thing a go so
apologies if the light goes in and out I
haven't filmed of natural light in ages
so I don't know how this is going to go
I'm going to start by taking some of the
Charlotte Tilbury magic cream there is
so much in this and it's just a really
nice thick cream I like to apply
sometimes just before I do my makeup if
my skin's feeling a bit dry it just adds
a really nice light layer of hydration
I'm just rubbing that into the skin
really like smell of this moisturizer
for foundation I'm going to use the
Revlon Colorstay I'm using the shade 200
nude and this is in the normal to dry
formula I'm just going to stop that
around my face this is actually a pretty
good color match for me I'm going to
start with a little amount
I'm taking my wet Real Techniques sponge
and just patting that into the skin I
really do use the sponge all the time
even if I'm just wearing a contented
moisturizer or if I'm wearing a really
full coverage foundation I always use
the sponge and I do a mix of like
patting and kind of swiping like this
I'm going to take another pump of
foundation and just lay about a bit I've
started kind of putting less foundation
on and then building it while then just
going in with loads of foundation at the
beginning very weird having my shutter
doses because there's people literally
outside their house across the road and
if they look up they're going to think
I'm crazy
Foundation is done I'm now going to go
in with concealer I've been using the
Maybelline the eraser I perfect and
cover concealer for ages now as you can
see I've nearly finished I've got a
backup just in case I really like it I'm
kind of I don't know what my opinion is
on the sponge applicator it's not very
hygienic it's very messy but I really
like using it to apply the concealer you
turn this a few times and then it's
literally just a case of like swiping
under the eye it probably does make me
apply a bit more concealer than I
usually would but the formula is quite
nice and thin so it doesn't look cakey
the colors may be a little bit off there
aren't there's some things only like
three to pick form which is crazy but I
really like the formula I look a bit
nuts right now I then hit my wet sponge
again and just Pat that in and I just
really liked finish of this concealer
Caroline picked me up a tart shaped tape
from LA I haven't had the chance to see
her yet what I saw has we both forgot
the concealer so excited to try that one
because all the American youtubers are
going on about it but yeah I'm really
enjoying this Maybelline concealer for
now passing that and I like to take it
onto my eyelids as well and then what
usually happens with every concealer I
use is that I apply all over like that
and then I like to go in with a little
bit more just under my eyes I just like
dad and then what I usually do is I'll
use a brush to Pat that in because the
sponge does absorb a lot of the product
so I'll just take my Real Techniques
setting brush just Pat that I'm a little
bit spotty on my chin I'm just going to
leave it because you guys don't mind for
bronzer I'm going to use my absolute
favorite two-faced milk chocolate
bronzer I mean look how much of this
I've used I feel like maybe it's drying
out a bit I didn't have the right word
for this powder but it doesn't feel as
good as a fresh one doesn't my need to
get myself another one but I pretty much
nearly finished this just applying that
on my cheekbones and on my jawline bit
down my neck and upwards my temples I
kind of apply everywhere but with a bit
of a plan a bit of a purpose to where I
apply it just to give a little bit of
shape to the face but not properly
contour for blusher I'm going to use Mac
blush baby because kind of like a muted
pink I think this will go really nicely
with the eyeshadow with the lipstick to
give up kind of
all over lilac soft pink look this is an
old blusher patter ages but it's a bit
less pink than some of my others a
little bit more subtle rising it so
pretty
I'm also going to use a highlighter
while I'm doing this of cheek area and
I'm going to use on from the anastacio
blow kit and this is the glow kit
inkling there are four highlighters to
pick from I usually mix these two
they're actually stories bottom two
crushed pearl in starburst I think sort
of looks because it's a line licky pinky
look I'm going to go to starbursts which
is a really nice golden soft peachy pink
I like to use the morphe M 501 brush and
you really don't need much of this cream
highlighter would be nice at this lip
but I've only got a Mac harsh I feel
like I've used a lot so I'm going to go
for powder really pretty how I like for
my brows I'm going to use the same
product I always use this is the benefit
precisely my brow pencil I've used this
since the first day I tried it really
should you just get hold of than
Anastasio one I feel like it's so
similar I'm just going to fill in the
front of my brow and the arch of my brow
and then I'm going to try a new product
which I've had sitting on my desk for a
few days now it's from Charlotte Tilbury
and it's part of her legendary brows
collection which is a clear brow gel I
probably wouldn't buy this because I
really like the linked brow bar one but
mine is so groggy now so I thought I'll
try something new it sounds a bit
different because it has a really really
tiny brush like tiny I don't know how
well does it work or maybe but I'm just
going to brush through the hair I think
this would probably work best on someone
with less bushy brows than I have I kind
of prefer one that's a bit more wet but
that will do today oh I forgot the steps
I'm just going to go back and I'm going
to spray on this it's the pixie glow
mist you can see it like really oily so
this definitely wouldn't be good solid
oily skin but see this could be great
song with dry skin like me who diplomas
says it has propolis
I don't know what that is and argan oil
and nourishing hydrating and protecting
and shaped up because it's oily I really
hope this doesn't go
my hair whoa well big spray sometimes I
just like misting something to stop all
the powder products listen to powdery
okay next up is a product which I kind
of based this whole look around it's by
NARS and it's an eyeshadow called quarry
and I love this dry December I wore this
a lot it's a slightly pinky toe P purple
shade I don't know what the actual
official description of this eyeshadow
is I'm sure it was they online it's
shimmery it's buttery I really like it
I'm just going to use quite a fluffy
brush actually Pat a bit on there I'm
just going to swipe that over the lid
and then build it up as much as I kind
of want it so you can have a really
light layer which just gives you kind of
a little bit of pink
I think these eyeshadows can be used wet
or dry such a nice lie lucky shade I'm
going to put on a few layers with the
brush dry and then maybe miss to the
brush and see what it looks like wet I
hope I don't mess this up I'm going to
try it inside of that pixie mist and now
my brush is a little bit damp so I
really like the wet lid look at the
moment now to give a bit more
pigmentation actually I think people
often quite scared to a pink on eyelids
because it can make you a little bit ill
I think if you get the right shade it
could be so pretty and I'm so into
blushed shades at the moment no change
brushes for a moment so I could get a
bit more color this is the match 2-1 7
I'm going to really get quite a bit of
product on there now taking a smaller
brush this is the zoeva 231 luxe petit
crease brush I'm going to put that under
the eye as well I always like to take my
eye shadow under the eye this gives you
like a smoky effect but without it being
too smoky because it's a nice kind of
last shade that looks really nice
so I'm going to leave that there I
actually love it I shadow you don't need
any more colors I think this one alone
is really pretty and for the eyeliner I
usually wear brown eyeliner I think when
you're wearing a pink I said it's nice
put a bit of purple in there as well but
I don't wanna go too long purple so I'm
going to mix a couple of our liners but
I'm going to lay it on the makeup
forever at
where Excel liner in m80 which is a
purple and then I'm going to layer on my
max groundbreaker brown eye line on top
and kind of mix them together because it
would give a brown but there's a bit
more of a perfectly Brown I think will
go with the eye shadow little purse is
really close to the lashes because I
don't want like a proper purple eyeliner
look press that in very close to the
lashes I don't like to go too far into
the eye as well my eyeliner like to
focus it on the outer corner just
because that flatters my eye shape more
always harder to do this eye so now on
top of the purple eyeliner and gonna put
on some Brown and then using that small
brush again very lightly going to blend
them together I'm going to try a
different mascara today that I only
think I've tried before this is the
Kevyn Aucoin the curling mascara I have
my Charlotte Tilbury legendary lashes on
backup in case I don't like this because
I'll pretty much know straight away the
very thin mascara got cute little brush
nice mascara is quite subtle kind of
gives more length in curl rather than
volume but it's prettier to do it so you
know
yeah I'm going to go with that do the
other eye very easy to comb through the
lashes with this brush Oh No caught my
hair and the mascara put a tiny bit on
the lower lashes now for the second
product that inspired this look so it
was the eye shadow and a lipstick and
this is what I was wearing a lot in
December this is a lipstick from Stila
it's called wheel and it's a lilac
emo when I side foot on it looks a
little bit much but I then I like to rub
it in with my finger so let's give it a
go it's quite a matte lipstick I love
the shade of this lipstick but honestly
the formula is just quite drying for me
I'm going to put a bit of vaseline on
top she found my lips are quite dry at
the moment because of everything that
went through so probably not the best
example
so I find it it does short lines quite a
lot on my lips if anyone knows any other
lipsticks that this shade but maybe a
different formula let me know because I
love the shade I think the line of the
lips looks so nice with the kind of
pinky taupe on the eyes and that's it
I'm going to put on a bit more blush
because even though in real life I look
okay in camera and look a little bit
pale so what do you guys think I really
really like this look I think it's a
nice way to wear a bit of
color maybe colors you would normally
wear pink on your eyes purple on your
lips but then it's not like crazy pink
and crazy purple that you would think
it's subtle and it's kind of nude
looking I hope you guys enjoyed this
