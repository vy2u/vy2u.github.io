hey good morning everyone today is
Wednesday the 21st of December I'm
carrying on my like organization things
yesterday I don't know what's gotten
into me but I'm now kind of sorting
through all of my hard drives and
clearing them out and making sure I put
like up-to-date backups of all my
computers so I'm just coming to doing
that before I start editing the vlog
most from yesterday I haven't had my
advent calendar yet today okay 21 go to
running out getting close to Christmas
Day presents are looking good I want to
take an Instagram photo today but
there's like no natural light literally
it's who dog today so I'm hoping some
good photo editing will come in handy oh
my god I'm just sorting through all my
videos and I found this organization
going on here I have split this up by
year 2014 2015 2016 and then I've got
like vlogs main videos I even renamed my
videos so I can see what they're all
about
vlog miss 2015 I am loving this
organization although I don't know where
day 1 to 5 is making me realize how many
vlogs I do I think I actually do more
vlogs and I do main videos it's crazy
how much I've like documented my life on
YouTube it's absolutely crazy how old
some of these videos are I remember them
like it was last week like spring style
guide the beauty scenario tag these are
all like 2014 videos I have so many
videos to go through now but I'm kind of
trying to collect them all in folders
and I'm finding this very satisfying so
I've now labeled all my hard drives so
I've got this one which is for computer
backups for my desktop and my laptop
this one has got videos from 2014
both the final I both like main videos
and blogs and
2015 it's got my wedding photos and
wedding videos and my Lightroom backups
which is my photos and I've also got the
wedding and Lightroom on this one this
is the one I travel with though so I
don't want to rely too much on this in
case I lose it
this has my youtube music on and like
most recent videos from 2016
but I've also backed up 2016 videos on
here all the procedures are moving from
one hard drive to the other I am going
to make myself some avocado on a bagel I
don't think the whole of today's vlog
I'll be looking like this but I'm just
trying to get stuff done this morning
and then I'm gonna get dressed and head
to spacing K to get something but I need
to eat because I can I feel like I'm
flagging I love these like giant green
avocados I'll find them so much softer
and like sweeter I always do this to get
the PIP up kind of stop in and twist it
then to get the avocado out I just use a
spoon if it's soft enough it's pretty
easy just kind of go around the edges
and scoop it all up and then I just use
the back of the fork to smash it all up
okay and I like to add some salt and
sometimes a bit Chilean but I'm not
going to today just a toasted bagel
actually got so much over card a and
then you have my avocado on toast and a
bit on the kitchen table - I literally
keep forgetting to vlog and yes I'm
still in my pajamas but I've just been
taking an Instagram photo because I
really want to share my Christmas
wrapping this year so I've just arranged
like four presents here and I was just
taking some photos think I'm going to
attempt this one and see if with some
editing because you can see like these
areas are really yellow maybe I'll show
you how I'm gonna edit this okay so this
is the photo I'm going to attempt to
edit I think this is always the hard bit
for me picking picking which photo I
want you know I think I won that one so
I always like to favor it the photo
there
I'm going to go to vsco and import that
photo go to favorites and is there then
I'm going to add the f2 filter put it
around there and then I'm going to save
that to my camera roll then I like to go
to Lightroom I'm going to turn up the
exposure a bit and the contrast I kind
of just play around until I'm also going
to turn the temperature down and I'm
going to turn saturation down as well
I'm gonna save that to my camera roll
and then I think I'm going to just
because the lighting is so bad in here
I'm going to use the face tune to just
whiten the background I don't use face
tune for anything else I hate it when
people say like come on admit it will
you'll use face tune to edit our selfies
no I don't I never ever edit my face on
anything so when you get the white and
tool and I'm just gonna go over the
table this part is really fiddly and it
normally takes a little while so I'm
basically just using my finger to whiten
the table I'm gonna do this and come
back to you guys that's what the first
thing looks like now that I've white
into the table and I really like it
actually sometimes I use details to just
go over parts of the photo like I can do
the candy cane but I don't always think
it needs it I might do it this far
actually I think if you overdo it it
just looks too fake and yeah there you
have it I'm done
save the camera roll I also use an app
called mosaic oh so I can kind of plan
where my photos go so if I just add in
the photo here I can then move it to
there and I can kind of see what it will
look like cause that's the last photo I
posted you can also write the caption
and when you're ready to post you just
kind of press that and it copies it to
Instagram so if you're too busy to write
a caption you can kind of pre write it
and then post it
ready it is time to edit yesterday's
vlogmas it's two o'clock gosh okay I'm
gonna leave myself like an hour max to
do this I've spent the last few hours
editing yesterday's vlog Merce doing
lots of work ends until my hard drives
and all of that hasn't really been
anything to vlog rich is ours Christmas
party all evening so I'm just like home
alone I do need to go to space and Kay
and I need to go to a supermarket I
obviously need to get out of my pajamas
to do that I really can't afford to put
on makeup though I think I'm just gonna
not anywhere else I wouldn't care but
space and Kay's on those places that I
know without sounding big-headed I think
the one that I go to one of the girls
who works there watched my videos
although she watched my videos and she
sees me laughs anyway I'm just gonna go
out with no makeup on I'll put on a hat
that'll help the situation I want to go
buy ingredients so I can make chicken
soup for dinner because it's so cozy and
it makes me feel good my sister's not
feeling well and she said she was making
some for herself and it made me want to
make some too so I can show you guys how
I do that I think I've probably shown it
in a video before but I'll show you
again yes yes yes okay five seconds ago
this yellow other which I know that
everyone suffers from this was
completely full my whole computer was
full so I couldn't export my vlogmas
video I couldn't edit and I will show
you guys what I did in the top right
corner
I searched Disk Utility clicked on that
and then I pressed first aid it kind of
runs the first aid on your computer I
then we started my computer and look I
mean I still have a lot of other but oh
my god it's half the amount thank God
for that okay this is gonna have to do
also I feel like this jumper is just the
perfect thing to wear in this situation
because it's like no explanation needed
really I'm gonna put on my really warm
boots because I'm feeling chilly
okay so this is what I'm dealing with
right now every year me and my friends
there's like six of us you know them
Gemma bear and SJ rob me and rich we get
together for a little kind of Christmas
dinner and we do Secret Santa and we
normally go to the pub it's really cozy
and cute and the budget is normally 20
pounds which I think it's quite hard
because it's more it's too much that you
can't just gets like silly and it's not
quite enough to get something like great
so you end up in this weird like middle
ground I'm never sure what's again this
year I had to buy for Rob and I'm pretty
sure I bought for Rob last year and I
can't remember for the life of me why I
got him so I really hope I didn't get
him the same thing again but it's it's
so hard it's hard to buy for a guy as
well and you just don't know it's like
serious I'm not serious or so hard I
actually spoke to SJ his wife and she
said that he would like some slippers so
I got him some slippers I got him these
ones from muji and I could know really
nice and they're really soft
I think he's gonna think they're such a
lame present but actually these one this
didn't even take up the full budget so I
also wanted to get him something from
Space NK because he works out a lot and
I think something's post-workout for
like the bath or the shower could be
really nice and they probably wouldn't
buy for himself but then he'd actually
quite enjoy but I get like present
paranoia like he's just gonna be like
this is really lame I really hope he
likes it I'm gonna go Space NK now and
see what I can get and then I'm also
gonna go to Waitrose and get all the
ingredients I need for chicken soup sure
I haven't been at my flat all day I'm
ready to go get some shopping and then
come back home again back in my pajamas
I've been and done my shopping but it
just wasn't like pluggable there was so
many people around and I wasn't feeling
it so I'll show you what I got when I
get home but I love how this is the only
time of year where I feel like
succeptible to buy sausage rolls from
the supermarket and eat them all the way
home in the car I've had three I would
never do that any other time of the year
I've spent a lot of money and space okay
so I'll show you what I got and then we
can make some chicken soup this has
turned into my regular spot where I sit
and show you guys stuff but I bought so
much stuff from Space NK so I'll show
you what I got
so for Rob because by the time this
video goes up we'll be
doing a secret santa thing anyway i
think i'm gonna wrap it up like a post
gym kit so the slippers and it's all
wrapped up now but I bought him the
aromatherapy associates
bath oil and it's the revive one so it's
really like it kind of refreshes you I
don't know he probably won't appreciate
it cuz guys just don't
well that's generalizing most guys will
not understand how incredible an
aromatherapy Associates bath oil is but
hopefully SJ will say to rob that's
really nice bath oil because I really
did think about this program he's gonna
think it's so lame such present paranoia
I also got another ESOP resurrection
hand wash because we ran out yesterday
we bought this when we first moved in so
a year and a half ago I'm not even
joking we use it everyday it's lasted so
long
wait that doesn't even make sense i must
have bought another one maybe we've gone
through too I don't know but we just
keep we buying it because the best hand
wash ever I don't think this is the one
with exfoliating beads in one of them
has exfoliating beads in I bought this
for myself
it's the mio liquid yoga and now that
I'm working out once a week let's see
how long that lasts this is like four
kind of post workouts grapes and salts
in it it's always like arnica all these
great things in it that I just meant to
help your muscles and dissolve away
stress e aches and weary woes warning
may cause relaxation and Happiness it's
a really nice brand and I think Anna's
recommended this to me before there's
something in here for my family Secret
Santa
because even though I've already spent
over the budget I just saw this and
thought that they would really like it
and I just think you're getting at one
present I really want it to be really
good for that person so I just bought
something to add extra so I can't show
you that in case anyone for my family's
watching but and then I also got another
Space NK shimmering spy scandal I really
didn't need this especially as I've just
shown you guys like a huge Dipti candle
but I finished this one last week and
it's their Christmas candles
like limited-edition and it's so good
you liked it right now literally I think
like up there my like top five handles
that's now lit for the evening so that
was my home okay I am ready to make
chicken soup and if you want the actual
instructions it's all on my blog I've
got it though no I know how to make it
and so I've got an onion I've got some
celery and carrots parsnip I would
normally have some Swede and tomato but
I couldn't find them so I went to quite
a small supermarket I've also got um
chicken thighs so I'm gonna put the
chicken thighs it's got this big pot my
big chicken soup pot I'm gonna put
chicken thighs in and cold water and I'm
gonna bring it to the boil until all the
yucky stuff comes on top whilst I'm just
bringing the chicken to the boil I'm
gonna cut all the veg onion I peel but I
leave it whole oh my god I never have
this hard of a time peeling an onion
what's going on this onions just trying
to embarrass me on camera I'm gonna chop
up the celery I'm gonna peel the carrots
and the parsnip before chopping them up
as well yeah well the veg is prepped
I mean I'm massively missing some
ingredients here but oh well with the
veg I'm gonna be adding two chicken
stock cubes
these are Telma these the ones that my
family use now gonna add all the veg
into here with the two stock cubes I'm
gonna put the lid on and just let that
kind of cook for a while I've made some
macaroni pasta
the soups looking good actually it
definitely could do it longer I think it
tastes best when you just cook it like
all day and but I'm quite hungry now
because it's like quarter to eight so I
think I'm just gonna have some Lady and
the Tramp is on TV and I've got some
yummy chicken soup what a good night in
Moore which is out getting drunk is
Christmas party I'm watching The Grinch
and I'm gonna start editing today's
vlogmas The Grinch is finished I've had
two bowls of chicken soup and I'm now
gonna watch Grey's Anatomy I'm such a
massive Grey's Anatomy fan I don't know
if any of you guys watch it but it's so
good like crap good
I've watched a few years oh I need some
human interaction the only person I've
spoken to today is
girl at Space NK I'm gonna end the vlog
