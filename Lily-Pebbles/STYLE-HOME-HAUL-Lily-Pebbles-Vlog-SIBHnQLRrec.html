good morning everyone welcome back to
another vlog I'm actually really excited
to vlog today feeling good feeling fresh
also hair just curled well you know you
two having a good hair day it's actually
a little bit greasy but this bottom
section it just curls well I'm happy
about that
I am going to put myself in for a
haircut just like mid to end fair but
perf isn't going to be doing so much
like book promo stuff and March my hair
needs to be looking good I've got quite
a few gray hairs but I'm going to make
sure to tell him just to trim it because
I know you guys love it long and I'm
quite enjoying it long too so I've just
been doing my makeup and getting ready
for the day I'm actually at home today
but I wanted to get dressed properly and
do my makeup and hair because it makes
me feel way more productive and I need
to have the very productive day today I
am believe login oh and this flood is
very kindly sponsored by Clio and I
actually can't wait to tell you guys
about this because I think you're really
gonna love it so I'm going to tell you a
bit more about Clio and what Clio is or
who Clio is in a little bit in this look
I just want to put something on my lips
I don't know whether to put a bit of lip
balm on first I really wanted to try out
this deal glow in halo pink which is one
of the limited editions it's like a lip
balm but it's like holographic pink and
I actually normally wear matte lips I
never really wear glittery lips but
there's something about this that makes
me want to try it I'm just putting on a
bit of glossy a balm calm cuz my lips a
bit dry I don't know if I'm gonna regret
this because I might leave me with
glitter on my mouth all day just gonna
put a little bit on
do I look glittery I think the idea is
that it kind of plumps up your lips hmm
let's leave it at that
not go to your overboard I really like
the formula of the lip blows though okay
so what is the plan for today I have an
important phone call with Hodder to talk
through page proofs of my book so this
is kind of the last thing before it goes
and gets printed they just have a few
questions about some of my kind of
Corrections that I made and then I've
got a sofa being delivered very exciting
I will talk to guys through that and
show you what we got just kind of
getting my life in order I've got a long
list of to do's that I need to do I'm
gonna hit the stairs and have some
breakfast for us studios I'm working
from home all day so I know that I've
got a long period of time where I can
burn this candle without ruining it I'm
gonna treat myself and liked my teak
Rose delight candle machine not a
massive rose fan in terms of candles but
definitely wanna use my candles more
this yet but I'm gonna start with this
one look how pretty the packaging is and
I think this will help me be very
productive today I'm gonna put it next
to me I put my teeth laptop glasses
definitely want to wear my glasses today
because yesterday I had a real headache
after sitting at my computer oh I've got
cool in five minutes okay it's cool time
ah okay let me bring you guys a little
closer in you or do you no doubt and
what can I rest you on okay you are
sitting on a pile of books let me take
my glasses off because I need them to
talk to you guys I want to talk to you
guys today about clear because as I said
they are sponsoring this video and I get
questions a lot about life organization
money management saving all things like
that really and I tweeted last week
about was it last week maybe a couple of
weeks ago about clear because I've been
using the service for about three months
now and I got a really funny message
from Cleo saying that I'd spent more
than 97% of customers at H&amp;amp;M home or
something hilarious that I had to tweet
because home homes but I thought you
guys would be really interested in this
because I know a lot of you at the same
age as me and you're often asking for
advice
it's different for everyone but I've
always been very good with budgeting
money knowing how much I've got to play
with and always making sure I'm saving a
certain amount every month since I left
uni and got my first job actually I got
my first job at fifteen but I mean like
first Popper job out of uni I've always
had some kind of like savings in place
of some sort so if that's something
you're looking to do then I think you
might be really interested in Cleo now
let me try and explain what it is is
basically like having a friendly
assistant on your phone who helps you
manage your money it's not like logging
into your online banking and checking
your bank balance
it's a conversational interface so you
can literally have a conversation with
this little assistant on your phone
who's fully aware of your spending
habits now before you freak out and
worry like I did initially it's a
read-only access so if when you give
access to clear they can literally just
read your statements nothing more than
that so it's completely safe and you
don't have to worry so the whole point
of clear is that you can budget and save
so Cleo
works on your facebook Messenger and
you can literally have a conversation so
you can say like how's my budget looking
this month I'm gonna put something a
little video up on the screen actually
because I feel like it shows you really
clearly what it's like to have Clio on
your Facebook Messenger and by the way
this is just an example this isn't a
video of my bank account or anything
like that you can ask how much have I
sped on uber this month how much have I
spent on eating out this month how's my
savings looking if you have a savings
plan in place you can really ask for so
many different questions and I also find
that clear is just so fun she's got like
a real personality she often sends gifts
which are really funny and I just really
like getting the updates it really
reminds me to be on top of my spending
and be really aware of how much I've got
to go shopping or whether this month I
should not shop as much sometimes I get
messages saying here's what you've spent
this month so far or this is what you
spent on the weekend and I find those
messages really helpful I just think
it's a really good idea I think it's
really easy to keep on top of your money
and I thought you guys would like it
because it's something that I've
definitely enjoyed doing and I'm 100%
gonna stay on Clio I've been testing it
out for a few months for this video and
I'm definitely gonna keep using it
because it's it's just been really
helpful my friend Lucy has used it for
ages and she told me about it and I've
annoyed that I waited so long to sign up
because yeah really been enjoying it so
I'm really glad I could share that with
you guys and introduce you to something
great I also think it's quite 15 to talk
about money management in this vlog
because I think today I want to show you
some new things that we've got for the
home and some new things that I've
bought to where I've been quite good at
not shopping much over the last couple
of months I have got some new things and
all high streets items
I think of clothing I'll show you in
this video do a little bit of a haul and
then we've got a couple of new sofas
that I really want to show you it's
really exciting getting new things for
the home but as we're probably gonna do
like a full renovation I also don't want
to get too many nice things because then
we're gonna have to just like throw them
as storage let me do up the house so I'm
getting like a few nice bits but they're
surrounded by not nice things anyway
it's nice to get the odd thing here and
there so I'll show you that as well in a
bit I just need to do some work first I
think my sister's gonna
top round with Rocco her youngest so
that'll be nice to have a quick cuddle
always cheers me up candle is going
strong smells nice actually it's not too
strong Rose it's quite a subtle scent
which I like oh my god I just heard the
delivery man pull up outside I am so
excited we are getting a snuggler which
is basically their version of a love
seat from Arlo and Jacob but getting the
snuggler for downstairs and a chair for
upstairs I'm gonna ask them to the
delivery men and then once this will set
up I'll talk you through it
so basically backstory
I recently showed on my Instagram
stories that I bought sofa bed from
heels we have I've been wanting a sofa
bed for my office for quite a while
because my office is basically our
second bedroom our spare room so I
wanted to get a sofa bed for my office
or a let me take these off I've been
looking for him for ages they're quite
pricey even the one from Ikea I wanted
one that kind of looks like a sofa it
doesn't pull out it kind of just goes
flat I'm a bit like the one that anna
has even the one for mikey it was like
550 and the one i really liked was from
sofa comm which was even more expensive
but then when i looked into it more like
anna actually gave me this tip she said
make sure when you look for your sofa
bed like that that it actually is kind
of like a double size because a lot of
them are a lot smaller so actually once
i started looking at the dimensions the
sofa duck on one I liked was actually
too small I want it to fit two people
comfortably if they're people if my
friends and like family or whatever
gonna stay over I want them to be
comfortable so I ended up looking at
heels which is where Anna got hers from
and I found one that was in the sale
still expensive but you know it's
instead of us buying a double bed for
our spare room so I actually ended up
buying that one and it came actually
I'll quickly show you upstairs I went
for blue velvet as I said on Instagram
stories and it was definitely more blue
than I expected but I think it's really
cool I like kind of statement furniture
and when the rooms actually done and
it's painted and we have a new window
and there's so much more that we want to
do in this room and I think it would
look really cool and I'll be off to
lifestyle out
heels blue velvet really gorgeous soft
it's kind of like a royal blue and then
it kind of fold this back bit folds down
and it's a really comfortable bed this
light by the way is from Aldi I'm
obsessed with them I've got bedside
lights and two of these as well because
they're so cheap so this is the heels
sofa bed that will be bought but then I
also got an email from the lovely people
at Arlo and Jacob and they wanted to
introduce their brand to me this is not
a flattering light and honestly I'd
never heard of our own Jacob before so I
was really excited to discover the brand
and they invited me into their showroom
so I went with rich and my parents
actually one weekend and we had a little
look around and they have some gorgeous
gorgeous sofas and they actually offered
to send me one wish I just feel like the
luckiest girl in the world especially
after splurging on this one as I'm sure
all of you would I said yes please
I would absolutely love one so they
kindly sent me a couple of bits and I'm
over the moon that's what came today the
first thing is this cocktail chair and
it's like a light pink blush I
absolutely love this I want this for our
like in built and bench downstairs where
we get a dining table this sort of dome
you know was called the starb I love it
so it's a little chair and the idea of
this was that it would sit in this
corner one day I would paint this and
like put some prints on the wall and
make it cool and it could be like a
little filming corner for me for when I
do Beauty videos or any kind of I sit
down videos I'm not sure now that the
pink in the blue might be too much
together it's so hard to tell because
the floors not done the walls not done
the windows not done like it's really
hard to tell for now I think it's gonna
live in this corner I could also use
this on my vanity desk I could use it in
the other room it's gorgeous
I'm so so happy with this so let me go
downstairs and show you the snuggler
it's the best bit so the rest of the
furniture in our lounge is the stuff
that we had in the flat safe it was from
multi york the table the rug from West
Elm this poof is actually from next but
my mom ordered me an amazing pink velvet
pouf for my birthday from my calm but
it's not coming for a while so we have
this one and then our armchair is also
from Westar armed
was over the other side we've just moved
it here for now so let me show you the
Arlo and Jacob snuggler oh my god isn't
it incredible we went for this teal blue
Eve Elva in the end and they had so many
swatches and it took a while to pick
because nothing's done in here but I'm
hoping that we can have like Navy walls
once it's done and I think I think it
was just really warm and cozy I would
have loved to go for like a pink or
something but I want this to last so I
wanted to go to something that was like
a little bit more subtle but still a
statement because you've got like a gray
sofa and everything else is gray I
wanted to have a color this is gonna be
like a no child free zone but it's so
beautiful we had to go for this specific
one because a lot of them are much wider
they're like two seater sofas and we
just had this little kind of window area
to fill so it's the perfect size we got
the one with brown legs and it's so
comfortable so now we can have like
three people on that sofa for a push one
person there and you can definitely have
two on this one like a couple the aim
was to have room for at least six people
so like when we have friends around we
can all like sit and watch The Voice
together because that's what me and my
friends do because we're really cool
it's so comfortable I'm so happy with it
thank you so much to our own Jacob for
sending me this I'm over the moon and I
think I might just make this my new desk
I'm so happy I feel like our lounge area
really feels like a lounge now because
there's enough seating for everyone I
need to get around to doing that house
tour because I feel like when I talk to
you about these things it's really hard
for you to understand like where I'm
talking about I'm gonna do it I hey my
sister said she is on her way with a
very hungry little boy he's actually
just started this really awkward we have
these like mega awkward cupboards here
he's just started eating food properly
and so she said can you scramble him one
egg no salt please so I'm on baby food
making duties
look who's here this is a scrambled egg
mom cute so cute
do you like scrambled egg okay my sister
just popped out for lunch it was really
nice to see her and the baby now I'm
just gonna carry on with my work I need
to plan out my videos for the next few
weeks month really because I'm gonna
have so much sorry the reflections on
I'm gonna have so much like book stuff
going on I can't really pre film because
I do lots of blogs these days but I can
kind of plan a little bit and think
about when I can film stuff so that is
what I'm gonna do now and then I'll do a
quick little haul for you guys I think
as I said before I feel like I'm really
on top of my budget teen and I've been
really good and haven't been the
shopping for a while I was really
tempted to kind of splurge on a new
handbag recently because I thought I
needed to treat myself after writing a
book but then I realized I really just
don't need one I laid out in my bags and
I was like I don't need a new bag I have
all the bags I could possibly need I
actually really want to go on a holiday
with rich so that's something I'm
definitely saving up to do and I wanted
to get a few new items of clothing I
really liked my winter wardrobe and I
feel like I've got some really good like
jumpers and jeans but now the weather's
kind of changing slightly I feel like I
wanted to get some more transitional
pieces I also wanted to get some items
because as I said I'm gonna have lots of
events and things around the book so I
want to know I've got a few nice outfits
for that and also a lot of new stuff has
been coming into stores that have ever
even enjoy now I don't tend to spend
much on clothes during the summer months
because I don't really like summer
clothes so this is the time of year that
I tend to splurge a bit on clothes but
nothing's really crazy crazy expensive
anyway I'm gonna do a little haul for
you guys I hope I'm not too far away
you're on my desk I'm on my bed there's
nothing in between so this is gonna have
to work okay I'm just going to go
through all the things
I've kind of laid them out over here let
me bring them forward first of all a
pair of jeans I have so many jeans I
know but I wear them every single day
it's my absolute uniform when I'm told I
can't wear jeans for something I
literally don't know what to wear these
from and other stories and they're you
know I don't know what the style is
called but there's straight leg and
they're cropped but they're not they're
not frayed at the bottom like a lot of
my other ones these to me feel like
somewhere in between the Urban
Outfitters ones in the Topshop ones the
Urban Outfitters ones are very stretchy
and they do get quite baggy the Topshop
ones are so tight I can't breathe in
them so these are somewhere in between
and they're really great just like
everyday jeans so I'm happy I got those
although there are more expensive than I
thought I'm so used to buying Topshop
jeans they're the only jeans I buy and
they're 40 pounds and these are about 70
I think I had a voucher actually from
Topshop so most of these things were
bought with a voucher which is so fun
because it just feels like free shopping
that's the best thing ever let me just
do them up I know that I need more
trousers in my wardrobe because as I
said all I wears jeans it's just about
finding the right ones it's really
difficult for me these are really nice
they're high-waisted they're navy blue
with a kind of green and white pinstripe
and they fold up at the bottom they
don't fit perfectly I always feel like
these off houses are either a bit small
or too big so I went for the ones are a
bit small which means that when I sit
down they won't be super comfortable but
they are really flattering I thought
thought they'd be good and I'm doing
like panel talks and things like that so
those are really nice all of these
things I'm gonna link below also if
you're ever like if you all want to know
what I'm buying I've got a section on
the front of my blog called recently
purchased and I always put the items in
there or if you go to the top right hand
corner of my blog and there's a shop
link and I've got links to Wardrobe
Beauty or things like that so always
check that out if you're not sure also
from Topshop is this grey jumper now I
saw this in store and it said on the
little tag cashmere blend so it's really
flexing that Topshop have started to do
like cashmere blend products because I
love cashmere it makes it so much softer
and like nicer to wear I thought this is
really cool because it's like a gray
kind of thin jumper but it crosses over
at the fun and I just thought it's
really different because it's a bit
shorter at the front you can wear it
with like trousers and he nailed it
really cool and I just thought that was
really nice can be worn with jeans
as well and then I saw that Anna bought
this one it's so nice I said to her
looks just like her expensive version I
do works from I don't tend to buy like
designer clothes but this looks just
like another jumper that she has so I
obviously asked I was like is it okay if
I buy it because I think I might have to
just like course friends always buy the
same things this is also a cashmere
blend I don't have many black jumpers in
fact they don't think I have any like
jumpers so I really like this I like
this got a bit of a V because it's a bit
different to my other jumpers it's kind
of ripped let me stand up for you so I'm
wearing leggings it's like short a bit
longer at the back and then it's got
slightly fluted sleeves as well which I
just think is really nice also from
Topshop is this blazer now I have a bit
of a love-hate relationship with Blazers
as you guys know but I absolutely love
the one that Lizzie Hatfield hat
Hadfield Hatfield Hadfield I don't know
actually sorry Lizzie but I went around
to have flat recently and she actually
let me try on her Stella McCartney
version which is beautiful
not only is it not available anymore but
I don't think it's a sort of item I
would investing don't know if I'd wear
it enough although it was beautiful
but I saw this one in Topshop it was 65
pounds which is still a lot of money but
way less than designer and it's a really
nice checked blazer and I thought it's
perfect because it's quite a trend piece
for me I don't know if I'll wear it
forever so I'm happy to buy kind of the
Topshop version it's got this at yellow
running through it which i think it's
really cool I'm really into yellow at
the moment and I just think that's
really nice I need to find a excuse to
wear it now I'm worn it yeah that's
everything from Topshop yesterday I
picked up some new pajamas from the
white company love pyjamas I got rid of
my Christmas ones and I needed a new set
I normally have kind of two pajamas on
the go so that one's in the wash I have
another set to wear these are from the
white company they're just gray simple
gray so soft though and obviously the
top to go with it's just like a
button-down so if it's a bit bright 95%
modal or 5% of last name I don't know it
modal is feels a bit like a jersey very
very comfortable like has like a nice
weight to it this I also picked up
yesterday I'm I went into whistles
looking for their t-shirts because
they're white t-shirt with the little
like slogan there I wear like to death
aware every day is the perfect white
so I really want to get another one but
they don't have any other styles in like
that at the moment they've changed their
t-shirt styles which is very annoying
but I saw this and I couldn't resist and
it was way more than I would normally
spend so I did get this in the end and
I'll tell you the reason I got it first
of all it looks like this it's navy blue
from whistles and it says low weekend I
don't think I would have got this if it
was a thick jumper but it's actually
really thin it's it's hardly a jump for
a tool and I thought this would be great
because I could tuck it into those blue
trousers I could wear it almost like a
top and it would work throughout spring
as well because I wouldn't get too hot
in it so that's why I thought was a good
thing to invest in because I don't have
any other jumpers that this thin that
would work like a top I just thought
that would be so handy to have in my
wardrobe so I'm really happy with that
but yeah it's definitely more expensive
than I would normally spend on a jumper
so I feel a bit naughty about that this
job but I actually didn't buy the brand
sent it to me they emailed me asking if
they could send me a gift they didn't
tell you what it was which is a bit
scary because then if I get it I don't
like it I'm a bit like sorry
like I don't mention it if I don't like
it and then I feel really bad I have to
offer to send it back and it's pretty
awkward so it was quite risky but I was
willing to take a risk than everything
on their website looks so nice the brand
is called lair 100 CL up at the link
down below but it's a cashmere Brian so
everything's cashmere and this is such a
gorgeous pink cashmere thick like ribbed
jumper I love it I don't have any
jumpers like it that's pink it's quite
cropped they actually sent me a small
when I opened it I was like no not a
small I'm a medium but my mom was like
don't panic try it on it looks quite big
and she's right actually it fits
perfectly I'm never a small so things
obviously come oversized from this brand
I really love it so I'll link that down
below very lucky to be certain that it's
gorgeous
and then the final item again wasn't
planning on buying this but I've had my
eye on this coat from Reese for so long
and I didn't buy it initially because I
thought it was too expensive for what it
was I had a bit of a voucher to spend at
Reese but I've kind of been saving it
and then it went into the sale and it
was half-price still expenses but more
what I would have expected for a coat so
I got it because again I've got nothing
like it when I trying to buy things now
I'm trying to buy things I haven't
already gone it's a gorgeous like kaki
green color
it's like a gray-green it's got these
really nice lapels I think it's called
it's like it feels like a picot this is
what it looks like
got nice black buttons it's got this
little thing on the back it's very hard
to show you let me see if I can put it
on anyone out my window is gonna think
I'm crazy actually ordered it in a 10
and a 12 and ended up keeping the 12
because the 10 was a bit tight up here
it does come up a little bit small I
really like that and I think it would
look so nice with like black skinny
jeans and boots which is not a look I
wear that often anymore but I definitely
would crack it out for this coat and
that's everything that's my recent haul
okay I'm gonna go downstairs and
continue with my work something I'd like
to ask you guys for help with I feel
like I'm quite good when it comes to
certain like decor but something I find
really difficult is cushion styling
don't even know if that's the thing but
I really struggle to know what like
cushions to put in certain places like
my bed but your bed isn't as big a deal
because no one else sees it but sofa
cushions so the places I need help with
are on my bed but more importantly sofas
I don't know what cushions to put on
this I actually really like this one
which I got from Stockholm so I might
get that maybe I've got another one I
could add to it or something else and
then I don't know what to put on our
gray sofa sorry it's a mess
to make it kind of give it a bit more
life and then on here we've currently
got this I'm not sure if it works and
then upstairs as well on our blue one I
just don't know which pushes to buy
where from I feel like they want some
H&amp;amp;M home are a little bit too cheap like
they're a bit thin if anyone has any
cushion recommendations please let me
know it's something I definitely need
help with well this vlog is far too long
