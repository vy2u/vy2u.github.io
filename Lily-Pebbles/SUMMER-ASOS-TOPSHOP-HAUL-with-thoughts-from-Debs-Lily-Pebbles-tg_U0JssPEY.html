video I know I didn't do a haul for so
long and then suddenly I've done two
quite close together but this is more of
a summer holiday haul because I'm going
away and I have nothing to wear
I'll it through my summer clothes there
after the bed and they're all so old
they're like five years old and none of
them fit properly so I just needed to
like refresh my summer wardrobe and I'm
just in that mood like I'm really
enjoying shopping at the moment I'm
really liking all the clothes I'm seeing
online and this video is sponsored by
Claro which is the service I really want
to recommend to you guys Clara is a
Swedish company and their whole idea is
about making shopping online so much
easier they work with loads of retailers
including my two favorites a sauce and
Topshop but they work with so many so
I'm going to link their shop directory
down below in the description box so you
can see which retailers they work with
but basically it's so simple really safe
and very easy to use their service means
you can pay when and how you prefer so
they offer a few services all in like a
one-click process they offer direct
payments payment after delivery and also
they offer installments the pay later
option is obviously amazing especially
if you're going on a last-minute holiday
and you have to pay for house stuff or
for any other reason you can't pay at
that time it just gives you more time
it's such a genius idea
so this is how it works once you select
Clara as your alternative payment method
on checkout say on ASOS they'll check
your legibility and hopefully allowing
your order through they then pay the
retailer immediately you get either 14
of 30 days to pay for only the items
that you decide to keep and you don't
pay any interest when paying by card or
bank transfer it's so good it's such a
good idea I just really wanted to tell
you guys about it and so let me know if
you've used it before or if it's
something you think you're going to try
okay so I've got quite a few things here
from Topshop and a sauce and what I'm
actually gonna do is show you all the
items now and then I'm gonna try them
all on at the end and my friend Deb's is
coming around and she's gonna be helping
me decide what to keep and what to seven
back there were so many requests at my
last video for Deb's to give some kind
of like a commentary and I just thought
that's such a good idea because that's
what happens anyway like after the last
haul I filmed she came over and was like
yeah no yeah no but I really like value
her advice we have very different styles
but she's very good at
kind of putting aside what she would
wear what she likes I'm thinking like
what suits me so I will put deficit
Instagram down below if you want to go
follow her also as a disclaimer I've got
absolutely wild four spots I don't know
what happened to me but obviously I'm
wearing this top which is from Topshop
it's the same as my black one but in
polkadot
and I think I bought about four things
in this hall that are white with black
polka dots so I don't think I can keep
them all because I will look ridiculous
but you guys can help me decide which
ones to keep let me start showing you
other things because there is a lot to
get through here the birds are so loud
if you can hear the birds I guess it's a
nice things better than like a drill or
something okay so first of all are these
sandals these are from Topshop and
they're pretty funky Liv got this like a
tropical print on them for me keeping
shoes or sending shoes back is all to do
with the Comfort so I'm looking forward
to trying these on but I like sliders
they're so easy to wear in the summer
you just slide them on and these are
like a crisscross style I just thought
they'd be an interesting sandal to wear
and they're kind of exerting enough that
I can wear them in London on the cheap
but they're also kind of exotic enough
to wear on holiday so those the sandals
like I said I'm gonna link everything
down below i'll also put i think i'm
gonna try this out and see what you guys
think but i'm gonna put one link where
all of these items are featured in one
place so you don't have to keep clicking
on the separate links but I will put the
several links or as well just in case
that's what you fer okay the next item
is something that I have needed in my
wardrobe for so long but I haven't had
one of these it sounds like a teenager
I'm sure it's a denim skirt and I always
see people wear them with like cute
t-shirts and shirts and they just look
great and it's a good alternative to
wearing like short shorts because I just
don't feel comfortable wearing shorts in
like a city so this is just the Topshop
moto denim skirt and I know I'm gonna
like this as long as it fits well it's
got a bit of fraying on the bottom but
even just like with the shirts are so
cute I'm really excited to wear that
that's just like a staple summer
wardrobe piece okay here we go
with the spots I did warn you it's a
little bit crazy so this is a place that
I saw on the Topshop website it's a bit
different to all of the other spotty
things but everything else is very much
like white with black spots but this is
kind
like cream not really short the material
this is made out of but it feels a bit
thicker
it's a playsuit so the top looks like a
shirt and then it's a short sleeve got
it's got a tie waist and then these
shorts and it's got that tuxedo style at
the top that I'm wearing so I know that
I'm gonna like the top and I don't have
many places I think they're really nice
to wear in the summer this looks like a
little bit smart so this would be good
for like a summer party I mean I would
totally wear this to a casual summer
wedding but I don't have one
yeah exercises try this I don't know if
I love the color because it's kind of
like an off-white and the spots are very
big which i think makes it a little bit
kind of like clowny compared to this
which i think is a bit more classy so
I'm interested to know how that's gonna
look I find that quite like an exciting
purchase it is something a bit different
from my wardrobe more sports this is a
summer dress I've seen quite a lot of
people talking about from Topshop it's
got that funny like stretchy material
around the boobs which I'm never sure if
I like or not but what I thought was
good about this one is it's got straps
as well so if you don't like wearing
like strapless clothes it's got straps
and then the little sleeves go off the
shoulder so I thought that was
interesting it's made out of a really
nice kind of like muslin cloth material
so it'll be very light and summery with
these soft dresses I always have to do
they're like see-through tests and see
if you can see my panels but as long as
you can't it looks like it's gonna be
quite a nice length like mid length so
excited to try that I find dresses just
the best thing to wear on holiday and
also just when it's hot it's so nice and
breezy
the last thing from Topshop is this bag
which I don't need but I just thought it
was so cute it's a big straw bag with
like plants and oh I think these are
monkeys under the trees you can't really
see the monkeys so much but I just
thought that's such a good holiday bag
you can use it to like fly with as well
because obviously I'm not going anywhere
like long haul I think it's like two
three hour flight maybe so I can just
use this cuz they're quite hard to pack
and then it's lined I can use it when
we're going to the beach or by the pool
and I just think it's really cute or so
you can use it like when I'm in London
if I'm having a picnic or something I
just hope the Sun stays out I would get
so excited with sunny by all the summer
clothes
then it just starts raining again I love
this I think that'd be a keeper we'll
see what Deb says ok let's move on to a
soft stuff this dress looked really nice
online but I'm a little disappointed in
the fabric it's a very thin and quite
hard feeling fabric it's almost like
it's meant to be linen but it feels a
little bit cheap I thought this was
interesting because it's got quite an
interesting neckline and around the boob
area and then it's got these like
tortoise shell buttons that go all the
way down and it's quite a short skirt so
I will try that on I don't know when I
would wear this though because it's
black it's not something I would wear
like what a sunny day because I'd get
really hot I guess it's more like an
evening summer dress I don't really go
out much so I'm not 100% sure about that
one it looked nicer online if I'm honest
this one looks interesting I've still
been on the hunt for the perfect
jumpsuit I called it a boiler suit in my
last video because that item they
ordered was called a boiler sooo online
I think the difference in a job suit of
boiler suits I think a boiler suit is
more it's like a shirt here with short
sleeves and it's less looser overall I
think that might be the difference or
maybe it's just American versus UK but
this is like collared jumpsuit with
short sleeves and then I really wanted
one that was like baggy on the legs the
only thing is I think this print looks a
little bit like pajamas I think I would
actually look like I'm wearing a pajama
onesie in this but it feels really soft
it's got big pockets it looks like it
could be cool I thought this might be
one of the items at Deb's is like yeah I
love it I'm like oh I don't know it's
one of the things I might keep and never
wear because I haven't got the guts to
wear it let's see not sure about the
print more polka dots I know oh this one
was more of some address like on holiday
and I could definitely feel the
difference between the material this one
of the tops at one this feels more like
a beach dress it's like just plain
customers that one was a bit more fancy
so this isn't off the shoulder at polka
dot dress
I like the dot they're a good size and
then it kind of goes in it the way it
goes down and then has this little like
bit at the bottom then I describe that
this is very much a beach dress which I
guess he couldn't really
a swimming costume I normally wear so
many questions it has to be like the
strapless thing but you could wear in
the evening as well I don't know I'm
gonna try it on it looks kind of cute
it looks quite short actually oh I'm
excited for this because this is quite
different for me I haven't got anything
like this in my wardrobe but it looked
so nice on the model online it's a skirt
and it's meant to be worn quite high
waisted is this really nice like burnt
orange color it's coming up a little bit
lighter on-screen and then it's got
these small white buttons and it's kind
of like MIDI a bit longer than MIDI and
it's got a bit of a slit in it as well
I'm excited to try that on actually
because if it looks anything like it did
on the model I think that would be a
really nice summer piece of my wardrobe
to wear with like a little white t-shirt
or a little cami or something it's also
really nice and lightweight okay the
next item what is this it's black oh
this is the jumpsuit still on the hunt
for the perfect jumpsuit this one has
little strappy straps and it's it's very
much like a V it looks like it's meant
to really like go over your boobs and
then the back it's kind of stretchy like
stretchy around the top part of my waist
which is actually good because that's
the small bit and then it's really loose
and loose all the way down oh my god now
holding it up though it's really
see-through so let's see it's difficult
to see when things are see-through
because you kind of need to like be in
the Sun to test it but as long as I wear
like nude underwear at least it's black
it's it also looks like it's a bit like
harem like it's like baggy on the crotch
um so yeah well I said to try that okay
last item this one I'm not so sure about
it looks really nice on the model and I
actually ordered a 10 which is my like
smaller size of either a 10 or 12 and it
looks huge it's got a zip down the back
it's like so these are the straps they
go straight up and then it's got this
print it's massive and then it's just
like it's baby I could dress with this
like cool green print at the bottom I
don't know I just
this is a bit of a wild card but I
thought it looks kind of interesting
there's no way of me showing you like
this what it looks like so I'll
definitely try it on I'm interested to
see what that looks like on it looks
quite big but maybe I can just see if I
like it I can always change the size so
that's everything I
it up from Asus and Topshop and now I'm
gonna try it on and ask my best friend
what she thinks this is the ASOS dress
which they said was more kind of Beach
like because of the material compared to
the other one
so this what looks like honest the ten
it's like a little bit tight but yeah
what do you think me yeah yeah I love it
yeah it's quite short but I think you
feel like it's short because that line
is probably where you feel yeah yeah I
think I could wear in London I think
it's too much like a beach dress because
I don't really wear bikini tops so I'm
worried about the whole like having to
wear strapless I've just pulled my bar
shuts down I'd wear like if I wore it in
London I wear strapless bra yeah yeah
yeah it's very lightweight she's good
okay so you think this is a keeper but
you haven't seen the other of spotty
items yet yeah this is like my small bit
yeah and this is good on me this little
bit and you like a drop waist which
isn't that it kind of is yeah this is
the Topshop dress which I much prefer
the fabric of this it feels like more
expensive and this is obviously a longer
dress and this has that stretchy bit
which I'm never sure about because it
makes my boobs look huge it's also got
little straps which I like because I can
wear it with a bra what do you think
it's a bit more like granny
mumsy yeah we actually card because it's
got straps a bit cheeky bit yeah no no
more frumpy okay yeah yeah polka dots
okay so comparing this to the last one
you think the other one really I thought
this is more like like like you could
wear this on the team and you wouldn't
feel like you were in a little beach
dress is nice and this would be nice
this length if it was a more like a line
yeah it's just a bit like mm yeah yeah
okay this is the Topshop play suits
which I can never get this button it
inside done up it's a little bit
like around the boobs also I said when I
showed this earlier the spots are quite
bacon I'm not sure if it's a bit like
clowny the big polka dots hey what do
you think that's why I say that how much
where or gal big that's quite statement
you kind of wear it once and then you're
like oh I've worn my polka dot play suit
once it's quite thick as well therefore
not 100% on this it makes me think I
think I just look like one big polka dot
I know I like places yeah this is like a
maybe yeah this is the a sauce dress
which I really like the shape of I
really like the kind of neckline boob
area buttons I like that it goes out a
bit but the materials very cheap and a
bit like uncomfortable but I'm not sure
I kind of like it what do you think I
think it looks like meant to be linen
but it's like a cheap version of linen
or maybe it is but yeah yeah yeah you
know when I'd wear it as long as I think
it's black and I think I'd wear on a
summer's day I'd be hot it's more
evening yeah yeah it's not the most
comfortable dress I do really like the
shape but I think this is a good dress
that would seat many people but I'm not
sure I need it in my look I said I got
it at ed I mean look it's so gay fee I
thought I could fit like another person
in here it's I just thought it was cute
and like it is it's like I want to go
for a picnic that's what it looks like
great do you think I should change it
for an 8 or is it not that nice there's
a lot of material I feel like this style
of dress is obviously very in so you
could find it somewhere else
it's like almost nice it's a little bit
sound of music and I think a little
straw bag yeah this comes up big for
anyone who's thinking of ordering it
really big yeah yeah ok this is really
funny because Deb's has this and didn't
I say that I thought she was gonna like
it I love the the shape I love the kind
of looseness of it but I think because
of the print it looks like I'm wearing a
onesie like a Jarmo onesie yeah yeah but
it's in a funny material it's so sweaty
I ordered it and it like no it's not the
same material do you think I look away
from jamas yeah I yeah yeah you don't
because you're cool yeah I dunno I love
I'm gonna find one that's my main I
think it's cuz it's so baggy but I like
that bug you look I just think it needs
to not be in this print you're going to
like the next one this is the black
jumpsuit playsuit jumpsuit jumpsuit oh
yeah and I love it because it kind of
goes in at my small bit you kind of
shows off my boobs a little bit and then
it's all loose in like oh it makes me
wanna like do leaps and dance around do
you like it yeah it's so comfy and very
lightweight as perfect for summer harem
this is literally all repeating why I
said when I phoned earlier which is so
funny it is like a little bit harem but
not too much I think I will wear this
the entire summer I know it I think it
comes in any other color I would my
sister would love this as well I'm just
gonna buy one for everyone you know okay
this is just an and other stories top
that I've already got
this is Topshop denim skirt what do we
think yeah I like it I think everyone
needs a good denim skirt I don't have
one
yeah sorry and these sandals from
Topshop yeah yes really
okay don't easy okay
and the bag yeah very good for holiday I
think or do I just want like a little
straw bag this is more for like the
beach yeah but then I you wouldn't even
want to leave it yeah you're right maybe
this was a bit of a city purchase but
the skirt and sandals the sandals are
really nice I won't do a close-up for my
toes no one needs to see that happy with
the skirt just want to wear it now that
you have a dome skirt I bet this petite
you know this is the skirt which I
really like I like it I don't have
anything like this sorry yeah so it kind
of when you're walking you like cool egg
so I just made you want to do laser
shopping yeah I'm really happy with it

nice for summer this is definitely a
keeper yeah so that's everything which
