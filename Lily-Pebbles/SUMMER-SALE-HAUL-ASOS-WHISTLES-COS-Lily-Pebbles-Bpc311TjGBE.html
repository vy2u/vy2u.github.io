haul video I've been doing some online
shopping recently it's kind of sale
season and I always think it's really
annoying that the sales happen all at
the wrong times like all the nice summer
clothes have now gone into the sale but
our summers only really just started so
I always find it a little bit difficult
to shop at this time of year because I'm
terrible at shopping in the sales I'm so
jealous of my friends that are great at
like finding the bargains but unless
it's a higher-end store where nothing
really changes I just find the layout of
like sales so chaotic and hard to shop
in but online is much easier and I've
been buying a lot of stuff from ASOS and
it's great because you can just shop the
usual way you always shop on there but
if you're lucky some of the things you
like might be cheaper so I've got quite
a few things from ASOS and a couple of
things from whistles and cause as well
so let's start with the sale stuff that
I got from ASOS first up are these pair
of shoes and I haven't actually worn
these yet if I'm a brand called selected
femme and they were originally 55 pounds
and they went down to 44 so this is what
they looked like they are espadrilles so
they have this kind of corked bottom and
then they are a tan leather with black
leather straps going around the back of
your foot and I thought this would be
really comfortable because they're open
toe and the back is open as well so they
weren't kind of squash your feet in the
heat I've got some sandals but these
felt more kind of City appropriate
because if you wear sandals in London
and go on the tube your feet get so
probably so although I think that might
still happen with these they feel a bit
more shoe like a bit more sturdy for
walking around kind of town I have worn
these yet but I tried them on and I feel
really comfortable the town looks a
little bit weird with my skin colour but
they're different to anything else I
have so I thought they'd be cool with
like dresses or jeans even so I'm
looking forward to wearing those this
summer I just felt like I really needed
some new summer clothes last week I had
like a massive wardrobe Clara I just
decided I hated all my clothes
I'd so much winter stuff and nothing
really summery so I gave loads of my
clothes away to my sisters and I just
needed a few new like summery pieces
just to add into my wardrobe so let me
show you some of the tops I got from a
sauce this one's a bit of a wild card I
don't know if I can get away with it
tie-dye is very like hippie 60s and this
is like a green and purple tie-dye top
which sounds insane it's the t-shirt
just thought it was a little bit too
summery because it has this cutout on
the front and cutout on the back as well
and it's tie-dye at the top and then it
goes down to just a purple at the bottom
and it's kind of lightweight and I just
wear this like not for small occasions
just like weekends or a family barbecue
or something like that it's just kind of
easy to throw on with shorts I was
really lacking like nice tops so I
thought I would just get this and I do
really like it it's just a bit weird
it's not my favorite thing from this
haul this is by a brand called religion
and it was originally 40 pounds I got it
for 32 pounds okay next up is a playsuit
and this is by a brand called glamorous
this was originally 32 and I got it for
25 they only had it in the tool range
but I'm five seven so I think I can get
away with wearing stuff in that range
but I haven't noticed this been like too
long in the body or anything like that
if anything I actually think it's better
because places can sometimes be a bit
short on me so it's a playsuit it's off
the shoulder and it's have three-quarter
length sleeves it goes in at the waist
and then it has these really cute little
shorts with like little phrase on the
bottom or I don't even know what that is
but it's very sweet I haven't really got
anything like this I really like the
print it's very summery the only thing I
don't love about this it's the material
it's a hundred percent polyester so it
feels quite cheap and it definitely
makes you a little bit more hot than
like a cotton playsuit wood so that's
the only thing I don't like about it but
I really like the shape I really like
how it looks and so I'd wear this for
slightly like smarter summer occasion I
think it's really cute it's also a
little bit see-through so you have to
wear nude underwear but I was wearing
nude underwear and it looked fine you
couldn't really see it so that's okay
but yeah I really like this it's very
cute
the next item you've definitely seen
already because I talks about snapchat
I've posted it on my Instagram and I
know a lot of you guys have already gone
out and purchased it it's a place we
from ASOS it was originally 32 pounds
and I got it for 28 it in a size 10 a
lot of you guys were asking me because
I'm in between a 10 and a 12 and I got
this in a 10 because I think it looks
better fitted I got both sizes and this
is the one that look better it's a
kimono place suit and I've never had one
of these before and I love it it's so
flattering it's got slight sleeve which
is really nice if you don't like showing
the tops of your arms and then it goes
in at the waist and then it
looks like a dress but it's a playsuit
it's kind of crossbody on the boobs and
I just think it's so flattering last
time I checked they had all the sizes
available but I think they've sold out
for 14 and 16 now but I just think it's
such a good find and I'm so so happy
with it I've washed it once and it still
feels okay I hope that it lasts because
yeah I've really really enjoyed wearing
this I think it can kind of look like
day appropriately I also wore it to a
party like a summer party and it was
fine for that you can wear it with boots
or with sandals it's just so comfortable
it's like wearing pajamas okay so the
next three items weren't in the sale I
just wanted to get some nicer tops and I
went to whistles and the first top I
found is this navy blue one I think Anna
had this and black and white a lot of
you guys were tweeting me saying anna
has that top as well it's really nice I
have this like cutout like the tie-dye
t-shirt on the front and the back and
then it has these little sleeves which
this shape normally doesn't suit me but
I think it's really small and it's nice
to wear with jeans I just don't have
many tops like this that was smart
enough an outfit it has a really nice
seam that goes down the front and the
back it's just so easy to wear a really
good like staple to have in my wardrobe
I don't remember how much these items
are but I'm gonna link them all below in
the description box I'm gonna link all
the items I've spoken about even if
they've sold out just in case they come
back in stock so definitely go and check
the links in the description box below
the other top I got on whistles is a
black t-shirt and I have quite a few
plain t-shirts but this is just a little
bit more smart a little bit more
interesting so it's black and it's just
plain at the top like round neck short
sleeves but then like the bottom it has
this really cute like little pleating
that comes out the bottom and it's just
really different and so sweet and
definitely makes the outfit a little bit
smarter and I just thought would be a
really nice addition to my t-shirt
collection again it has like the seam
down the back which a lot of the
whistles t-shirts have and I think
that's really flattering
the final clothing item is from cause
this isn't really weather appropriate
but I know that this Sun will go very
soon and we'll be back to like autumn
winter it's a little gray sweatshirt it
has like three-quarter length sleeves
and it's just plain grey on the front
but on the back it has this little like
shirt detail so it looks like you're
wearing a a shirt underneath a cropped
sweater and it slightly overlaps
actually it like kind of opens up quite
a lot I just think it's so cool and so
different and
it was quite hard to find a size that
worked first up I went to only had a
large that was huge so then I was in the
hunt for a medium and when I tried the
medium on it was also huge so I ended up
going for a small I'm definitely not a
small I'm a 10 to 12 so this will
probably be huge on a lot of you guys if
you are normally a smaller size but the
small worked out for me really happy I
got it I'm looking forward to wearing
that when the kind of weather changes
again ok only a couple more things and
these are just some earrings I really
want to build up my earring collection
because I don't have that many I just
like small gold studs really I don't
think hanging earrings suiting me I
don't want anything too big so I found
these in Aranea that's by far my
favorite brand for buying earrings they
sell it in Topshop you can also find it
online the first pair of earrings I got
us in little gold pineapples they're so
cute pineapples watermelons and
flamingos are everywhere at the moment
they also had some flamingos little ear
stars - it's so funny like how can a
pineapple be on trend but it is and I
thought these would be really cute the
other pair I got are two different ones
one I'm already wearing in my ear it's
like a little leaf and I thought that
was really cute cuz it's like a slight
like runner it kind of goes up your ear
a little bit and the other one are just
three little gold dots like put together
a little cluster and I thought that'd be
nice when I eventually get this earring
out and I can replace it I need to get
like latex gloves because I just can't
get this earring out so those are the
earrings that I picked up I forgot
something
one minute I also got this dress from
ASOS this was 40 pounds and I got 32
nits from there reclaimed vintage range
I sure don't have a claim to vintage as
a brand or it's just a sub brand of ASOS
I'm not sure but I just thought this
looked really nice and light and airy
for the summer it's this blue print with
like I don't know all different kinds of
stuff going on I don't know what that's
called it has buttons all the way down
the front and it's very loose they only
have a size 12 when I bought this I
think they might have a 10 now so it's
slightly on the big side but it's a soft
dress where it's fine to be slightly big
it's so so comfortable really light and
airy so when it's a hot day it's perfect
it looks really cool with boots and a
leather jacket and also looks great with
sandals so I've I've worn its loads I've
worn all of these items loads like the
place suits and this dress you probably
have already seen on my snapchat
I'm loving the earrings and I'm looking
forward to having some smarter events so
can we
the whistles and cause items too so yeah
I'm really happy with my purchases it's
made such a difference to my wardrobe
having these kind of pieces in there now
I really hope you guys enjoyed this haul
and let me know what your favorite piece
that I picked up is and let me know if
you buy any of them as well I love when
you guys send me photos of like things
you've bought because I've mentioned
them a lot of you have done that already
with the pink play suit and it's so nice
to see all your photos so I hope you
enjoyed this little haul and I will see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
