with mark
hi the idea of this video is a Sunday
brunch Club they're genuinely here and
it is genuinely a Sunday my name is
brunch time it is we're actually we've
got refund a pound so I made some
avocado toast chicken we're just gonna
eat I basically come up with it all but
with five questions to do with Sunday's
an escape room and you guys have done it
I've done it I'm really excited I'm
worried we're gonna get stuck in I do
get stuck and they don't let you out put
it up to 24 hours cause I kind of think
I'm learning neither our mind like am i
fine places I think you'll be good at it
you might never see this is yeah I'm
it's like an hour and you like this and
that's a clock and you're like yes
question to do it Sunday what is your
ultimate Sunday breakfast okay I'll
start because I had a heads up with the
questions
hmm gotta say full English without
liking a veggie burger veggie fun
English at the moment because I like
veggie sausages but everything
everything apart in the grilled tomato
beans sausages bacon eggs probably
poached maybe fried see Martin's veggie
breakfast away the place we go to and
then asks for a sausage like make for
what's the veggie bit what is it all the
bit
Lumi greater sir sorry about yeah you
got an email
okay so breakfast sausage I just
sometimes I'm sausage hmm sometimes
button the veggie breakfast yeah if they
if they do it with a veggie sausage it's
really nice though okay my one Anna's
dying
yes I got I don't really like open it
and what's happened is literally as we
press record I trying to have it end
norman's and my one is a fake place that
we going to you it's like a 15 minute
walk from our flat at wonder down we
love there and they do but a sourdough
toast with homemade baked beans and I
like a lot bit spicy they're great on me
mmm different my things in that but
makes me going to know even never boards
so you shop and then they do poached
eggs
sometimes I go Friday I'm feeling like
whoa going out Friday to Friday's and
then they do their bacon so crispy you
can go like this I think they microwave
they like you do yeah so if you the
microwave a canned crispy on top
I just think beans bread bacon fried egg
hmm yeah I did think you were gonna say
like pancakes or french toast I think
I'm a bit too much she don't like my
feet too many pancakes all those years
ago yeah it's not a bit too much of
those thank you for a change
I've got to yeah I've been really
indulgent it would be pancakes with
maple syrup make it with some egg as
well without bacon and maple syrup is
just the best company in the world I
know you know normally I'd go for
shakshuka
Oh to the
it's two eggs bit chicken in there as
well what some digging mmm nice shredded
chicken right there like Shaq shakers
yeah that makes them cluck strutting
clapping yeah okay okay next question
what is your ultimate son of a bitch
watch as in TV or film what depends
because always something new is
whatever's on Netflix okay close record
if you weren't paying today and I didn't
make products of London for the day what
would you and you accept the sounds they
thought what would you watch we've been
watching a lot we watched love yeah yeah
the binge watch that on Saturday I think
it was Friday Friday night all over that
which is watch TV for like two and a
half hours we never do that and I felt
great at the end of it
oh my gosh that was fun evening I mean
we really want to watch the dr. Dre
documentary on Netflix so called rap
nation yeah it's four parts a friend
Matt was telling us about it yesterday
and he said it's very good worth watch
so we would probably be watching that no
something else that you said was good
well the David Letterman Netflix stuff
there's an interview with Obama and
interview with jay-z I don't want to
watch paper I mean um my like classic
would always be friends
always I was thinking that yeah you know
it's one chef go ahead Disney film I
love a Disney film on a Sunday like
tangled never seen that anymore as the
what Jeff ela them Sintang good about 10
times and Mandy Moore is the voice of
the main girl and now I love it even

so they come like it's kind of like pop
up come in called the dizzy goal which
is part of with a thing it's part of the
set which is at the artists residence
dizzy girl the bright bit of sensory and
it's consistently voted the best roast
and Brighton for good reason because it
is we've tried to cut up the lamb roll
is so good
we took my parents wrong man it's like
rolled yet called lemon oh it's
delicious and we took we took my parents
there and it's like a cool trendy little
place and you can't book a table and
hodgepodge inside and we sort of sat
down and parents like okay and then they
have the roots and then my dad was like
Anna you are right my mom wanted to work
right to be referred to I felt really
cool I want to cook easily the best we
asked don't have rice that often but I
really like that place you work with
your parents once when they're in London
the bear in hamsters yes the white bear
no longer bear oh it's no longer there
that was a really good one also the
crown
yeah I want to prove myself crouch and
we've been there evening sir
that was good mhm there are a lot of
papers I hadn't raced in ages I know you
had to fly it out last week and that's
what
very good Bianchini incredible unreal
what does your ultimate Sunday look like
like the whole day what would you do
from beginning to end
Oh what do you want to get back to you
have a think about this one yes yeah
about it my tortilla mix I don't like
just staying at home and I've been out
the whole days it's a little bit of a
mix so maybe going out to brunch in the
morning and then going back to like one
of our some of my family's house and
like having a plane with the kids
if the weather whoops kids going out of
the garden and then like give a take
away what should film in the evening
mm-hmm that's probably the best Sunday
sometimes I like a museum on Sunday as
well but most the time to stay local I
hope you find a yeah roadwheels B so
this I don't know ever this sudden has
ever played out in real life but I think
I've quite liked it I wouldn't make it
like super early I wake up at like I
don't know eight o'clock yeah cuz what
about my line on Saturday mmm like a
fairy on Sunday go for like a bike ride
just ashore you know sorta like an aha
come back have like my breakfast in the
kitchen with you that's nice and then
mmm and then just bum around the rest of
the morning I think and then go for
Sunday lunch somewhere really good and
go for not walk yeah yeah
yeah somewhere in the evening
yeah I think just like children just
just like relaxing
okay now record it you know get yourself
ready for the working week but Jillian
just recruit good
I think I'm awesome biscuit work
together because I married evolve a
minion layin because I wouldn't have I
wouldn't have laid it on plastics you
guys like moon I are we safe aliens
I feel like a little high end so we
getting food everywhere and then like a
light breakfast at home last markets on
a bike ride probably because I'm
ravenous in the elevator I couldn't wait
then we'd walk to a good roast mmm
library maybe in the morning I would
friend some shout out as well like last
month on the bike right I just love a
bit of like a mini organ like you know I
may have a bad taste or something bliss
and then yeah like a walk in the
afternoon I can walk in a local park and
then just come back from the bench
elasticated waist band dressing gown I
love a throw on the sofa I'll put my
very threat on say that I'm not leaving
yeah I am NOT leaving
I think that'd be that's a good good hmm
which bin when seumas marks so bike
rider or some balls of sporting activity
run Boxey combat but I'd go up about
eight or look as well that's annoying to
me then have breakfast either here like
this on a brunch or going out for brunch
there's two options and then yeah then I
thought what the other key thing I like
to do is go for walking like a proper
countryside forest or something and then
come back organize my life
in the weekend which gets really
stressful so maybe a message of the week
ahead so I like to have a plan what's
going to happen this week then watch
like a really good like action film or
something really trashy yeah and just
veg out probably take away and then
either for the lunch Sunday lunch going
back to that either a roast or like a
new restaurant I am into yeah yeah good
show or going to escape Kings Cross I
need somewhere there you know just eaten
but they will be hungry yeah yeah yeah
an engine escape rooms I'm excited and
