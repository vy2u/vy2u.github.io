forward to today it's kind of a semi
chill day also doing this ain't quite
special later which I will tell you
about in a minute but this video is
actually in collaboration with Block C

collaboration so I'm really looking
forward to telling you quite a few
things today and there's a lots of
exciting stuff coming up with me Anna
and L'Occitane it requires a sip of tea
so as you guys might be aware in the UK
we are coming up to Mother's Day soon
which is a holiday I really love I'm not
usually one for kind of the manmade
holidays I don't massively celebrate
Valentine's Day but Mother's Day and
Father's Day is always something I've
I've loved because I think it's really
special and important to celebrate your
mum you know especially as I've grown up
and got older and seen my sisters become
mums it's a day I think is important to
acknowledge and part of that is buying
gifts and cards but also just spending
time with your mom and showing them how
much you care I've really started to
appreciate how much my mom has really
done for me my whole life so every year
I like take it more and more seriously
but to help celebrate Mother's Day Anna
and I are actually hosting an event with
l'occitane they've recently opened their
new flagship store on Regent Street and
it's amazing it's got a macaron cafe in
it

unbelievable so I'm so honored that we

and I'm going to show you a couple of
bits in this bag tied up with a ribbon
these are a couple of things which I
would really recommend for Mother's Day
this is really cute this is the cherry
blossom collection and it comes in a
little pink pouch they love it when
things come in a pouch because then you
get to keep it off to it and we use it
you guys know I love the arm and shower
oil I haven't got that in here it's in
my shower this is the luxe tan hand
cream comes in this really cool
packaging my mom loves their hand creams
you can never go wrong with a good hand
cream oh this one says Lily on it that's
cute I didn't even notice I love the
packaging of these they're really
satisfying to like screen that out and
then also I think you can't go wrong
with the gift set lots of time do so
many different gift sets depending on
your skin type or the scent that you
like this one is the divine immortelle
collection oh these sort of things are
amazing let me just quickly open it I
just think they're a real treat this one
comes in this beautiful gold box look
imagine receiving that I just think that
is such a beautiful gift this one has an
oil makeup remover enriched water and
moisturizer and a little pouch I just
think it gifts they're such a good way
to go with a Mother's Day present so let
me show you what is actually inside our
little pouch it looks like this it's got
this really cute illustration of me and
Anna on the front it says lily and Anna
looks at Anne and then on the back has a
little picture and then basically quotes
from us on why we like all of the
products inside so let me show you
what's inside these little minis are so
good either for traveling or if you're
staying the night at someone's house or
you just want to pop them in your
handbag this is the almond hand cream a
favorite of both of ours we just love
the almond collection and this is a
really good size hand cream their hand
creams are amazing this is the almond
our oil in a mini I love these they're
so good every time I get a new one I get
so excited if you don't know what shower
oil is by the way obviously it goes on
like an oil but it kind of loud this up
and it makes my skin insanely soft this
is the lavender bubbles bath bubbles and
I love these as well they're great if
you want a relaxing bath in the evening
if you want to sleep well what's there a
tiny bit goes a really long way with
these this is the pillow mist definitely
a favorite of both of us we love this I
have the full size next to my bed a
really nice kind of Carmen lavender
scent you just mist on your pillows
before you go to sleep then this is a
mini of the precious cream which is one
of their best moisturizers again really
handy in a travel size really lovely
everyday moisturizer that will pretty
much sue any skin type so that's what
you get in the pouch which i think is an
amazing deal I'm so happy to be working
with Lux tan again so if you would like
our pouch I will link that down below if
you want to know more about the event
and you want to come meet us and chat to
us and get a free tote I will put all
the info down below and of course if you
want to buy your mom a Mother's Day gift
ahead of Mother's Day this year don't
forget to use Lily to get free shipping
until the 9th of March I told you there
was a lot of information but it's all
good stuff right now I just got cut off
I was talking to my friend Hannah who's
in Australia and I got cut off so I want
to try see if I can phone her again
because we keep missing each other these
long-distance friendships are not easy
I'm telling you especially in Australia
like by the time she texts back I'm
always asleep or like vice versa so I'm
gonna see if I can call her back and
actually get a good chat in because it's
been a while you know I'm actually doing
now I need to take an Instagram of this
pouch I'm just as like part of the
Welcome David lock the dialer normally I
wouldn't blog this because it's separate
to the video but it's kind of
interesting to see how I were to take
Instagram like this maybe so I'll show
you guys how I'm gonna do it I've
actually just stuffed the pouch full of
other products because I want to take a
picture of the products next to the
pouch and I don't want the pouch to look
empty little trick there so let's go
into the other room first thing I'm
doing is laying down one of these this
is a photo board really helpful when you
haven't got many places to take photos
this is obviously meant to look like
white wood floor you lay that down and
then I'm gonna see what I can do this is
a little prop from H&amp;amp;M home this might
help
normally these things they take
I'm really struggling with this one I
found one it's like a product shot it's
really hard to make it look right on my
Instagram hmm I think I need to just sit
and think about this one for a minute
and think what sort of photo would I
like to see of something like this
yeah what I've done is set up a couple
of boards on a table in it's a bit
bright for my bedroom so I come in here
and try to use a few different props so
let's see if this one works out it tend
to only really take like two photos when
it comes to it because I don't really
see the point in taking loads I like to
set up see if it looks like it works and
then if it does I'll take the photo and
then what I do is I Wi-Fi it to my phone
straight away whilst everything is still
set up so I can have a look and see once
I'd like edited it if it works so let's
see so I get the photo up on vsco cam i
crop it to four or five and make sure
it's equal on both sides and then I
think I'm gonna up the exposure it's a
little bit dark and add on a filter I'm
into the c8 one which does make the
darks darker but it also has this nice
kind of warm edgy tone to it I kind of
like saying that I'm gonna make the
temperature a little bit lower a little
bit more blue let's see what happens if
I up at the exposure it's definitely
lighter on one side because of the
window but I don't mind that I think it
looks cool I'm happy with that photo
actually he's got the pouch in it's got
the products it's got a few like props
to make it a bit interesting I really
like the backdrop I'm happy with that
Instagram took me about half an hour
maybe it's gonna save that the best idea
okay so the special thing that I'm doing
later today is going around to see my
grandma um now I really don't want to
give away too much about the book but I
don't think this is something that
anyone's gonna really care about other
than me I actually dedicated my book to
my grandma
it says I'm the dedication page to all
the amazing women in my life especially
my beautiful grandma Theresa now I only
have one grandparent left part of my
grandpa who died when I was five I knew
all my grandparents really well growing
up it's actually funny because none of
my grandparents apart from my grandma
ever saw me even start my blog my
grandpa and my other grandma passed away
I think it was like first year of uni so
just before I started my blog
so it's really weird to think that they
didn't even ever know what my final kind
of career thing was but my grandma has
been with me every step of the way and
she's so into like beauty and fashion so
it's something we really bond over and
we're really close and she's amazing she
looks incredible for her age hopefully
she won't mind me telling you but she's
like how old is she I feel like she's
like 88 or 89 it's ridiculous she's so
great and she says it as it is which is
a quality I love about her
anyway I'm completely rambling now but
my grandma this is turned into my
grandma's like this is your life anyway
I dedicated my book to her because I
wanted to and also because I knew it
means so much to her and she hasn't been
that well recently she's much better now
but I'm so glad she's better and I think
this is gonna make her year I know she's
gonna be so happy about this I don't
think she knows I believe she knows my
books been printed but she doesn't know
that I've got a copy for her so what I
wanna do is go around today and give her
a copy of the book which in itself
she'll be ecstatic about but then
hopefully she'll open it up and see that
it's dedicated to her and just be so
surprised so what I'm gonna do is
actually gonna take over some of these
looks tan products I'm gonna take over
the divine gift box as an early Mother's
Day grand Mother's Day gift for her she
loves looks tan she loves beauty
products so she'll be so happy about
that I think what I'm gonna do is wrap
the book up underneath the products so
it's like she takes the products out and
she things old was like I was gonna give
her products that she won't be surprised
by that and she'll be so happy and then
as like an extra surprise the book will
be in there too I'm gonna wrap the book
I'm actually not gonna sign this one
because these are just the copies I got
from the printer she's already
pre-ordered one so I'll probably get
this one back and then I'll sign her
pre-ordered one oh my god no that fits
perfectly gonna wrap the book put it in
the box oh my god this is so great
and then I'm gonna put the products on
top Oh
what is the other product I think it is
the pouch yeah I mean I think I'm gonna
give even though this says Lily I'm
gonna give her the hand cream as well
because she'd love that
this shows it's a little bit bulging but
I don't think she'll know
it's really heavy and then I'm also I'm
gonna put it in the Lilly and Anna tote
bag take it over in this I'm just having
some a laptop time there is lots going
on at the moment because the book I
literally every time I look at my phone
my managers like added science my diary
and I find an iCal if you just press ok
you don't really ever see where it goes
so I'm just like pressing ok to these
things and I'm like I don't know when or
where that is so many things coming up
I'm just trying to sort out my life
right now okay I kind of lost track of
time but I've just come to my grandma's
I'm gonna go in and see her my auntie
will be there as well and my mum now
that is a large size so happy oh nice Oh
what is her face cream I am so spoiled
you know this is just the meantime love
it I got you thank you so much oh my
exploration of female friendship little
petals to let the inside
I thought you'd like oh my god that was
so great I feel like that was a really
personal moment capture and I'm in two
minds whether this should go on YouTube
or not but I just I want to watch it
back and I want to have this memory and
I think you guys would really appreciate
sharing it um and obviously I asked her
if it was okay that was amazing I knew I
knew she'd have a good reaction but that
was such a genuine she gasped and then
sobbed like with her hands over her face
solved she was so happy and regards but
worried for a moment I was like I don't
want to give you a heart attack I said
half just like am i sorry that was like
maybe a little bit too shocking um and
then we just hugged and hugs and hugs
and then afterwards I don't know if it
was on camera she went in like crying
shred I'm gonna do a speech now I mean
my moments you were like okay and then
she just told us like how lucky she
feels to have such a great family and it
was such a nice moment I feel like we
lived that over and over and over I'm so
happy I'm gonna head in home now
I need thrown Anna because she called me
just before I went in see my grandma and
I said I hate call you back and going to
my grandma so and wow that's that's just
massive life highlight right there I
just realized that my grandma is 87 88
in April I just had to come and correct
myself because she'd kill me if she saw
that rich said quite a stressful day at
work today so I've offered to cook us
dinner and I'm feeling a bit like a
little bit like bloaty so I think we're
gonna we've been having lots of rice and
pasta recently I'm gonna make some soup
we've got a squash so it's my mom what
can I do the squash you like just make
soup I'm gonna roast it hopefully you've
got some carrots you might no actually
I'm just gonna roast it with lace and
red onion and whatever we have basically
veg wise roast it for a half an hour
till they're soft and then
Chuck in the Vitamix with some vegetable
stock and which is gonna pick up some
bread on the way home so that will be
our dinner tonight okay so I have
chopped up the butternut squash I'll
actually just put the squash in the oven
because I think I'm gonna fry up some
onions celery and anything else I have
garlic
we don't have carrots and I don't really
know what I'm doing but I think if I fry
those kind of saw taters they'll taste
better and roast the squash this kind of
all we've got red onion chili garlic
celery this smells amazing I love
cooking with celery I always forget that
it just adds such a nice flavor we
really need to buy it it just goes off
so quickly ups of things just while I
wait for my butternut squash to roast
and I thought I'd tell you guys I don't
know how there's no way I'm gonna be
able to tell everyone this because I'm
sure someone will miss it and get upset
but when you go on Amazon to order my
book it offers a paperback version which
isn't really a thing the book just comes
in hardback but a year later after the
book comes out it comes out on paperback
that's just saying that happens so if
you've ordered the paperback version
you're not going to get that until 2019
so make sure when you order the book if
you do order the book that you click
hardback it's really difficult places
that Amazon you can't really speak to
anyone and you can't I can't take that
down so I'm just worried I don't be able
to order the paint back and then be
disappointed it doesn't arrive in March
so just want to let you guys know the
squash is roasted it's nice and soft and
I've got all the other stuff here and
then I'm just making Sonic stop and then
I'm gonna put it all into my right to
make switch
I just think makes it taste so much
yummier and I love the
so I'm just gonna probably put it in bit
by bit because I might have to do it in
two batches yeah I managed to actually
fit it all in so I'm gonna add some
stock just to loosen it all up and then
I'm gonna put it on the soup setting
that one and then just start like
version it all together oh my god it is
delicious
putting about a liter of stock and it's
perfect it's still really creamy I'm
gonna put it in some bowls and show you
properly okay soup is served Rich's home
we've got some bread let's hopefully not
eating the whole life and I'm gonna sit
and have my dinner catch up with this
one about his day and I'm gonna end the
vlog here I hope you guys enjoy that
sorry if I made you cry it was proper
emotional today
totes emotion Sunday for my February
favourites which I'm gonna film tomorrow
difficult one to say every year I'll see
you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
