today I thought I would do some vlogging
because I have a really exciting day
ahead of me and I'm doing something I've
literally wanted to do for so long
Kinder Bueno have actually challenged me
to do something a bit different and out
of my comfort zone and so they've
organized for me and rich to do a virgin
experience day and go to go eight I'm so
excited
I've literally always wanted to go which
actually went for a stag do I've never
been if you don't know what go ape is
it's like a treetop adventure place
where you like swing come trees and you
like click yourself on two ropes I mean
I don't really know cuz I haven't been
but it always looks really fun so we're
just gonna show me how it's done and I'm
probably gonna do lots of screaming I
don't think I'm scared of heights but
I've never really been up a tree so we
will see I'm just so excited to be
working with Kinder Bueno you guys know
I absolutely love them I really love
hazelnut chocolate and Kinder Bueno is
like hazelnut cream with wafer and milk
chocolate is like my absolute perfect
combination they actually serve me a
load of chocolate oh my god dream day
they sent a mix of the milk chocolate
ones and then they also do like a white
chocolate one I have actually tried one
of these so looking forward to giving
that a go these are the ones that I
always buy so we're gonna take take one
of these with us for the ride I think
this can be our off to go a treat so
I'll show you guys what I'm wearing
today because I guess I need to be like
kind of sporty so Maureen leggings and I
ran like a longer top underneath a
t-shirt the weather's not amazing today
it's a little bit rainy I have my hair
in plats they're just like French plats
rather than the Dutch Pat's because I
don't know if you have to wear helmets
or not but this is kind of more flat to
my head to see I feeling sporty I don't
think I need a jumper because I'm
probably gonna get very hot with all the
swinging must put some trainers to
alright I've put on my yellow waterproof
jacket because it's just started raining
obviously we're in the UK summer doesn't
exist for my waterproof
trainers on Ritchie feeling ready
ah
I forgot that it's school holidays so it
might be very busy just trying to find
where the entrance is and then I think
we're gonna have some sort of some kind
of like briefing I think they like tell
you dude God and then they leave us to
ourselves I really hope I don't pull up
a tree just trying out the GoPro on his
head I'll just play in the Coulee let's
move your hands they can show everyone
how cool you look man put your hair over
we believe this might level I'm like
cornrows it seemed odd little difficult
and he's like no it has to do extreme
you okay we're heading now into the
forest I'm actually quite scared after
like the little was it called that
bitter we just did the safety bit
there's lots of like if you don't clip
on your form so I really hope that I
understood when he was there you know
let's get our power down on
they asked if anyone wanted to go first
as the example so obviously I did I was
always that kid in school who wants to
go first it was really fun and they said
that when you're like going on the zip
wire you don't know if you're gonna end
up going forwards or backwards or
sideways opportunity going backwards or
sideways you end up like falling on your
bum and I'm so scared of hurting my back
so I'm really happy that I landed
forwards and I Alex started running
before I hit the ground like Fred
Flintstone and then I did it really well
it was fun I think this is gonna be so
good
okay it's like - let's do this I've
already forgotten the code oh my god
guys look what I'm dealing with her
that was so scary
it was just nice fun toodaloo so
definition
this is pretty not outside oh my god
this one you have to stand on a
skateboard and go down the zip wire and
then you jump off the skateboard and you
go oh my god what the hell oh my god
this is the scariest thing I've ever
done
oh my god who knew I'm so good at
skateboarding that was really funny
unity like feel like you're flying on a
skateboard right to that one fun and I
didn't land on my bum I like running
again like Fred Flintstone okay now I'm
gonna zip wire literally through the
trees look ready
we're done hold on high five
so you have to high-five and vlog did
you enjoy it yeah it's really good it's
really one of the best that last one
yeah I got you've got your camera doing
that last one that was really fun I'm
desperate for a drink and quail breath
it's terrible how long to it I am I'd
really recommend that they food funnels
fill out one of those active couples
does active things together we are back
in the car finished with go away and it
was so so fun I really enjoyed it
actually that that fact there wasn't it
was like a barrel that yeah I really did
enjoy that bit but the rest of it was so
fun I really enjoyed the zip wires I
would definitely recommend going I had
such a good time I think we definitely
deserve a treat now I'm glad we bought
the Kinder Bueno with us we can have
like a aside each comes with like two of
these so rich you can have that on I'm
gonna have the other one I don't really
have like a weird way of eating this but
I like to just have a square at a time
to make it last
we're home and I made it I survived I
had such a fun day I need to take my
leggings off and check my knees because
I'm pretty sure that's probably the only
place where I have bruises but yeah I
had such a fun time we were just
chatting about at the whole way back I
would definitely go back again I think
that we really felt like a big group of
friends and I'm gonna end the vlog now I
mean rich you're gonna make some dinner
and we're gonna chill and I hope you
