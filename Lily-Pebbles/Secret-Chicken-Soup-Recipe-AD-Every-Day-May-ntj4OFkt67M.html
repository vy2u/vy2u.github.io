look at my dog circles I've just got
such a terrible headache still I just
literally feels like my head's gonna
explode don't feel great it's really
annoying I don't get ill very often at
all and today I've got loads to do
because obviously I've just got back
from Paris and I've got so much to catch
up on so much work to do I don't know
I'm gonna just take it slow but I've got
lots of the day I really really don't
want to get ill especially during
everyday May before that would be so
boring for you guys and very annoying so
I'm just gonna finish editing
yesterday's vlog that I started on Urist
on go here and upload Sunday's video and
then I've got some other stuff to do oh
dear not cool not cool
sitting in my office trying to work with
the headache and this is what's in the
room next door to me
I'm not having a productive day Oh God
when I stand up I'm just working in slow
motion but it's lunchtime so I'm gonna
go out there and make my comfort food
which is pasta with ketchup I know most
of you would be horrified but that's
what I make when I don't feel great and
then dinner I'm gonna make myself some
chicken soup because I won't really make
me feel better I'm gonna use spelt pasta
look at all these cookbooks by the way
I'm gonna do a blog post on my mom's
cookbook collection because it's insane
Madeline shores new book it she doesn't
even know who she is she got it like
before he wasn't even look like
pre-release she's crazy about cookbooks
so I just got sent there's some haircare
stuff from this new brown from Stockholm
it's called Maria nila and it's like
vegan friendly sulfate and paraben free
really like the packaging I think it was
trying that it's like a hair mask the
reason I'm showing you is because they
sent me this picture illustration of me
apparently
I wish I look like that I mean she is
hot I don't think Louis I mean but let
me know if you do but either way I
really like the drawings such a pretty
illustration she's got like a sexy look
in her eyes I just can't pull off that
facial expression I think the hair is
right though and that's the whole point
is the haircare brand I think I think
that has kind of this like - definitely
looks in better condition and has the
straighter roots than I do with no gray
bits in it there's a terrible lunch I
know that it just has to be done
sometimes ketchup and loads of parmesan
that's key I'm gonna get so much hate as
I just know it this is what I eat what I
don't feel well okay I have to head out
this afternoon to do a bit of food
shopping and I need to vote because
today is the day that you vote in the UK
I've actually never missed a vote I feel
like a lot of people they follow on
Twitter saying this is the first time
they voted I've voted once before wait
how old am I
20 I think once or twice whenever I was
supposed to vote I have voted so I must
do that later but I'm needs upon a bit
of makeup cuz I need to take some blog
photos so I thought I'd show you guys a
semi sick day makeup thing because I
don't want to wear too much makeup so
I'm not feeling great but I do need to
take photos so I
to put something on so I'm just gonna
prop you down here I'm gonna start with
mac fix+ they're bullies yesterday oh
it's very direct spray there's anything
I don't like about it but it adds a nice
bit of moisture to your skin it makes
your makeup sit quite nicely I'm going
to use the eve long a tinted moisturizer
I'm just gonna rub that into the skin
I'm not gonna put much on cuz my skin's
all right it's just my dark circles and
that's more concealer anyway it's gonna
rub the end this is like the perfect
color match vanilla for okay so that's
the base done very easy now I'm going to
use my Bobbi Brown corrector you can see
you live I'm gonna put a little bit for
the Bobbi Brown eye cream on first okay
I use a corrector first I have liked
peach so it's a nice peachy color I have
really dark circles today and the peach
will kind of counteract the bluey tones
so I like to press it and the inside of
my eye and on the outer corner that's
where I get most like darkness and then
I'm going to use a Laura Mercier
blending brush just to blend that out
take a little bit on the lid as well
because my lids very dark today we use
the Clarins instant concealer nice for a
sick day so I'm gonna put a little bit
on my chin a little bit
rhinos little bit on my nose and then
take a bit of that under the eye this is
a good concealer if you don't want to
wear foundation at all because you kind
of use it like a foundation okay now I'm
gonna use my new favorite bronzer that I
talked about the other day
Too Faced melt chocolate one still of
solar powder which is here just using
this at the moment because I really like
a
and then for my eyes
Hamilton use a bit of Mac Auto glitters
no actually use Mac patina which is that
eye shadow I use when just want
something on my lathe but I think too
much very precise of it all over not
going to put any eyeliner on I'm just
gonna put mascara because I quite like
that look sometimes a bit more fresh I'm
not as heavy looking I'm gonna use the
benefit roller lash which I'm loving at
the moment so if you can see from there
but it means my lashes so long really
like this kind of runny now I need to
get another one okay I'm just setting up
my tripod and I'm gonna use my camera
sticks and photos of these two MAC
lipsticks that are in my back pocket the
ones I got when I was in Paris and
there's a blog post with these two
this one is dark side which I really
like actually I'm really glad I picked
up its in the formula school amplified
so that's very creamy it's not matte
which means it probably will move around
but I really like it I think it's a nice
summer bold lip I'm feeling a bit more
human now the nurofen is kicked in and
I've done my makeup and got dressed but
it does make a difference issues done
that earlier I'm just gonna do a work
cool and then head out for some fresh
air I need some pressure okay my cool is
done and now I'm gonna head out I'm
gonna vote and I'm gonna get the
ingredients I need to make chicken soup
I always like to make my mom's chicken
soup when I'm feeling a bit rough she
normally makes it for me but she's out
today so I'm gonna get ingredients and
then I'm gonna show you guys how to make
it and this chicken soup recipe
seriously it's been handed down
generations from my great-grandma to my
grandma to my mom to me my sisters make
it it is like the best medicine it
really makes it feel so much better and
I'm not that great at cooking but
chicken soup I've perfected it after
years of practice so I'm gonna show you
guys today how to make that and it ties
in really well with some work that I'm
doing with NCS if you don't know what
NCS is it's the National Citizen Service
and it's the fastest growing youth
program for fifteen to seventeen year
olds in England and Northern Ireland you
may remember the say yes campaign if
YouTube has got involved with that a
while ago and now they're on like the
second part of the campaign which is all
about learning skills and hidden talents
my hidden talent is making a really good
chicken soup so I'm going to show you
guys how to do that it really is such a
great program though I wish there was
something like that around for me when I
was 15 to 17 so if you do want to find
out more and get involved
the website is NCS yes that code at UK I
put all the information and links in the
description bar below definitely go
check it out if you want to have like a
really fun summer making new friends
learning new skills it really sets you
up for when you start looking for a job
so I would recommend it I think it's a
really good idea so let's go to the
shops just gonna see what we've got what
we need I've got chicken thighs I got
color I've got a few carrots here I
voted for really good suffragettes are
we proud of me but can someone clearly
more intelligent than me tell me why
it's okay that we use pencil that just
seems really
to mean really not hello just be robbed
out of its pencil anyway someone tell me
so if that's a really stupid comment but
I was quite surprised that it was in
pencil
I'm sure last time it was in pen this is
the reason I love Twitter I just tweeted
about the pencil thing someone said it's
a wax pencil so it can't be erased and
they don't use pen in case water for
some reason gets into the box that would
obviously smear all the pen and ruin the
votes genius makes sense why we use
pencil now okay so I'm home after quite
a long time I've been out it was quite
hard to find some of these things and
it's because of the time of year and
there was so much traffic it was like
end of school time so I'm home and it
starts of it you can see if I'm actually
getting quite hungry now so this is what
you need I'm gonna list I'm gonna link
the blog post below where I put the full
recipe for this so if I'm going too fast
or whatever you can go and check that so
you need chicken thighs the ones that
are on the bone and with skin because
that's what gives it a little bit nice
kind of flavor and then you can find
these I found this one in Tesco because
is sometimes quite hard to find it's
sweet which is this one but this these
are really good packs for soups and
stews and stuff we've got carrots
parsnips onions sweet we also sometimes
put a turnip in there but it's kind of
long term EF return of so we're just
gonna leave that one out onion chicken
stock cubes actually want to hear these
we use these ones really like them and
you can find these in the kosher aisle
of supermarkets but any chicken stock
cube will do although this one is really
good little pasta is optional I saw this
one from Jamie Oliver thought this would
work nicely so I'm going to try that and
then you put these in as well if you
want these are like dumplings I am
obsessed to them because they store up
all the yummy chicken soup flavor I'll
show you how I make these afterwards but
I really really like these they're
better than dumplings that just feel so
good okay so the first thing I'm going
to do is get a big pan of pot
you also need celery which I already had
that's why it's not in my shopping bag
already doing for therefore in there
four or five chicken thighs and this is
a huge pan so I'm just gonna fill it up
halfway just with normal cold water
yeah I put the water on quite high and
I'm going to put four of the chicken
thighs in the water turn it up turn it
up until it starts boiling here's the
chicken thighs in there I'm just going
to turn it up to eight so it starts
boiling and then I'll show you what
happens once it starts boiling actually
in the meantime I'm gonna cut up all my
veg just gonna peel the carrots okay
carrots a passing peeled I'm just gonna
chuck those and then they're sweet I'm
gonna cut some half and then kind of
chop the skin off celery I'll just cut
onion I will just take off the skin and
leave a hole
my moms showing me how you get the skin
off the Swede how's a Swede without
wanting to say swayed okay
I've caught up with a celery carrots
turnip peeled young Yin
it takes quite a while to bring this
much water to the boil when it's cold
but it's slowly getting there and you'll
see that they'll be like a layer of fat
on the top and I just skim that off with
the spoon like this I'll show you and
then we add all the veg and stuff in see
ya that's the yucky stuff coming on the
top and once it starts boiling I'm gonna
take all of that off okay I'm gonna
start skimming off the fat I know it
looks gross but it's fine you just take
it off and it's gone okay all the fats
gone now so I've turned it right down to
seven and I'm gonna put all the veg in
now I'm also going to put two of these
stock cubes and they really are the
tastiest stock cubes but if you can't
find them you can use others one too
okay we're gonna put salt pepper in as
wrong that much salt and pepper okay now
I'm gonna give it a big stir let it come
to the boil again and then put on the
lid and let it simmer it takes for an
hour to cook but I always think it
tastes better the longer you cook it so
late if you cook it in the day that
evening or even the next day it tastes
better here now it's boiling I'm gonna
turn it down to six so you don't want it
to be simmering you want it to be kind
of boil in a little bit and I'm gonna
provide it on leave a bit of a gap on
the side like that
think I'm gonna boil my cook my passing
out because it doesn't matter if you're
cold because you're gonna put it in hot
soup anyway get that done and then I'll
show you how to make these okay in a
cluster but I make pasta normally I make
it a little bit al dente but in soup I
like to really stop so you can just kind
of citrusy when you guys
- the pasta really and I like using
really little plasticity you leave the
pasture there while this continues
cooking beside this is what it's looking
like I'm just gonna keep that at that
kind of bubbling but not boiling too
much it a bit on for like another hour
maybe I'm just gonna go I think wash my
hair - I'm going to start editing this
vlog okay suits been there for about an
hour we turned it down a little bit so
it wasn't boiling too much noise you
just lose all the soup so it looks like
this now and I'm gonna try it and I
don't think it'll taste ready yet cuz it
it needs kind of more time but I'm gonna
make the little pumpkin Adel's
everyone's gonna tell me it's not how
you say because everyone has a different
way of saying it you can call the matzo
balls or dumplings whatever you want to
call them I'm gonna make some those in a
minute put them in so they can get all
the nice super flavor in this box you
get three no two sachets this is the the
mix that you need so you have to crack
one egg into a bowl and beat it and then
you just add the sachet of powder in and
mix it all together okay eggs a beater
now I'm just gonna pull this stuff in it
looks really strange
you basically have to wet your hands and
then make little balls once you start
mixing it into the egg it turns into a
bit of a paste okay that's what it
should look like kind of like a paste
I'm gonna go wet my hands and then I'm
gonna make tiny little balls and lay
them out on a plate so I've rolled them
into balls this size and I'm gonna leave
them to rest a little bit kind of harden
up a bit and then I'm gonna put them in
the soup to cook in there so it starts a
little better now once it starts looking
like gold any Brown that's when you know
it's doing well but seriously you need
to try these with like any soup they're
like really light and fluffy
they've been but there won't be like
anything you've tried before seriously
so good these felt a little bit stickier
now so I think they're ready to go in
I'm gonna put them in the soup to cook
cuz then they get really nice flavor
okay as I said it definitely tastes
better the next day but I'm gonna have a
bowl now
we bought one and then I'm probably
gonna get I think I'm probably right
we're to have pasta and soup we've
always done this I think it's um when I
was little and I used to have this bike
dinner and they needed a bit more
substance I really liked it
okay so look this is what they look like
they expand when you put the row it's a
steamed up my camera when you put them
in the soup they expand oh I'm gonna
take liked yours are so good okay so
this is it
this is my chicken soup dinner I'll
either leave a link to the recipe below
or I'll actually write it down and I
will also leave a link to the NCS
website so don't forget to go and check
that out I'm gonna have my chicken soup
now and then I'm gonna go wash my hair
and collapse in bed yesterday has been a
tough day and really hope I don't wake
up with a headache tomorrow sorry that
it's been a bit of a boring home vlog
but I hope you enjoyed learning how to
make my family's chicken soup recipe I
will see you guys tomorrow
