today's video is gonna be a Sephora haul
and liquid lipstick Tryon it was
actually meant to be a vlog because I
spent the weekend in Disneyland Paris
with my family but I decided very last
minute not to vlog because I find
sometimes the vlogging is really hard to
appreciate the moment so I took photos
instead which I will be sharing with you
guys on my blog very soon and I'm
vlogging this week so that will be up
next Tuesday if you didn't already know
I upload every Tuesdays and Sundays so
don't forget to subscribe so you don't
miss any future videos ok so this order
came on Friday morning just before I
left for Disneyland and I couldn't wait
this video could have been an unboxing
but I've already unboxed it I just
wanted to rip it open and take a couple
of lipsticks with me for the weekend
this is a bit of a random Sephora order
I wasn't planning on making a video so I
don't know how exciting it is but there
are a lot of liquid lipsticks and the
reason I boarded so many liquid
lipsticks is because when I feel like
when they first came out it was all
about the Reds and the dark colors
because that matte long-lasting formula
is perfect for a red so all the liquid
lipsticks I have are Reds or dark kind
of purple burgundy colors and at the
moment I'm just having a real like nude
soft lip moment I'm also really not the
kind of person who likes to reapply my
lipstick throughout the day I always
forget and end up with nothing on my
lips so a nude liquid lipstick is the
ideal product for me and I've just been
so obsessed of that look recently I am
dying to get my hands on the Kylie
Jenner lip kits but I haven't been able
to yet so in the meantime there were
quite a few liquid lipsticks from
Sephora that I wanted to try out I'm
gonna talk you through everything I got
maybe I'll start with the non liquid
lipsticks first and then get to those
and I'll show you me trying them on as
well because for the first product that
really caught my eye is from a brand
called living proof I really love this
brand
I think it's co-owned by Jennifer
Aniston and well she has amazing hair
but it's just a really nice brand they
sell it in spacing kay but a lot of the
products haven't come over here and
there's definitely a different range in
the UK than there is in America this is
from their perfect hair day range which
I really like I've tried already and
this is the fresh cut split end mender I
have really dry split ends because I
straighten my hair everyday my hair's
naturally dry anyway because it's curly
and I just kill it even more with the
heat so this sounded right up my street
because it says it seals and heals which
is exactly what I need I like having PC
hair which is why I use wax in the ends
but you don't want it to look dry so
this is just a cream I might put on a
little bit now actually I tried this
briefly on Friday and it just seals the
ends of the hair I love the smell of
these products it's a little bit sticky
I quite like that because then it kind
of you know I don't necessarily want
that soft hair look I like it to be a
little bit textured so there that's
quite nice and what's definitely sort of
product you have to wash your hands
afterwards but I'm looking forward to
trying that more I think you can put it
on damp hair or dry hair oh yeah applied
it down here before styling or dry hair
after styling to touch up throughout the
day and the next thing I ordered was the
Beauty Blender solid cleanser and I
tried a couple of ways of cleaning my
Real Techniques sponge I actually have
the Beauty Blender I have the Real
Techniques complexion sponge I think
it's called and I love it but I really
struggled to clean it I tried using my
dr. Bronner magic soap like how I use my
makeup brushes but it left it really
patchy and it looked like you had some
strange disease and so I tweeted and
loads of you guys recommended the Beauty
Blender solid cleanser so this basically
show you it's in this little pot you
open it up it has a little pink kind of
grid thing so if you want to wash your
brushes or anything you can brush them
on that does that make sense and then it
has a solid bar of soap in here and you
just take your sponge or your Beauty
Blender you get it wet under the tap and
you just kind of swirl it around in this
pot keep squeezing it out under the
water and I found this worked really
well it cleaned the sponge really
quickly I'd say only had to kind of do
it twice and then it was completely
clean and it didn't have weird patches
or anything on it so I was seriously
impressed with this it made cleaning the
sponge so much easier before I was just
buying new ones every time they got
gross which really isn't a good idea
because they do last quite a long time
if you look after them so I'm really
happy I picked it up deaf near goodbye
the next product I've had my eye on for
so long but it's really not an essential
so I just never found myself picking it
up it's not a brown coat at sure and
I've actually never tried anything else
from the brand it's the skincare brand I
think and I really
likes it and this is the luminous dewy
skin mist if you want to get me to buy a
product
seriously put the words luminous and
Joey and mist in the title because this
just sounds so up my street I've asked
around I think it was Anna I was talking
to last week he said that it's quite an
oily spray so she finds that she has to
avoid her eyes if she's putting it on
after she put her makeup on but it's a
really light mist it smells nice and I
really like spraying like makeup setting
sprays on my skin I pretty much use them
everyday because I find that I get a bit
like bouncy happy with my foundation
sponge and I end up wearing a bit too
much and then the spray just really like
meshes the makeup into my skin so I'm
gonna put up a clip now show you my skin
before and after applying this mist and
I don't know if you're gonna be able to
see it didn't really make a dramatic
difference to my skin but it felt really
nice and I really like applying these
throughout the day this is what the
packaging looks like I think it's really
pretty and it's kind of nice and small
so you probably could put it in your
handbag although it is a little bit
heavy so yeah I'm gonna put on a bit
more now I think it just feels really
nice on the skin and feels like it's
doing a little bit more than say the
urban decay ones I use normally it feels
a bit more like skincare rather than
just like a water mist okay so now onto
the liquid lipsticks and I bought from
two brands Anastasio which they've just
bought their liquid lipsticks since for
a website which is so exciting but they
didn't have the shade I wanted pure
Hollywood they'd sold out apparently now
they're back in stock so gutted because
you can't really order one thing from
Sephora if you're ordering from the UK
so that's really annoying but I got from
Anastasia and I got from Kat Von D so I
will compare the two and show you the
colors I got so let's start with the
anastasi one today I just called the
liquid lipsticks and I got the shade
soft lilac which I am wearing now
there's definitely fewer shades to pick
from in the Anasazi range this one and
pure Hollywood the only two that kind of
caught my eye this is quite pink for me
I do like it but it's maybe not like an
everyday color for me because it's a
little bit out my confort zone in it is
quite pink I'd never tried any of the
Anastacio liquid lipsticks before
they're still quite new I think and I
absolutely love it the packaging is
probably the best out of any liquid look
I've tried it feels really nice quality
without being too heavy
the applicator I don't even know what's
different about it but I like the length
because the Kat Von D ones I find too
long I like the length of it the
application is really easy and the
formula just feels really creamy it does
dry down to a mat but it feels really
comfortable on the lips have any just
got these so I haven't tried wearing it
for like a whole day and reapplying it
but first impressions I really really
like these so I really want that pure
Hollywood shade okay so let me talk you
through the Kat Von D everlasting liquid
lipsticks that I got because I did get
four shades I can't believe I got four I
know I'm mad so the reason I made this
order in the first place was because of
this shade which is bow-and-arrow and
I've seen so many people talk about the
shade it's a light brown nude and it
looks pretty gross in the tube I think
but it does look nice on the lips once
it's dried down I found that this as one
of the lighter shades didn't apply as
nicely as the kind of darker Reds that I
already own I've mentioned before that I
don't love the packaging I find that the
applicator is far too long and I found
this one applied a little bit patchy but
after two coats it was opaque and when I
first applied it I thought this is far
too Brown and like murky colored but
once it dries down I think it looks
really nice and it's a really nice kind
of modern but nineties lip and brownie
nude kind of thing the next one I got is
lovesick which I think it's quite
similar to the one I'm wearing now from
Anastasia it's more of a pink again
quite different to what I normally wear
I normally stay away from the Pink's but
it's like a soft everyday pink and I
looked at swatches online and thought
this looked like something I'd quite
like to try and I'm happy I got it it's
a little bit too bubblegum pink for me
but really nice and again because it's
one of the lighter shades I found it
applied a little bit patchy at first but
after like the second layer it dried
opaque and looked really pretty on the
lips so that's the second shade that I
got and then the third one is called
double dare it took so long for me to
pick which shades I wanted but I looked
at so many swatches online maybe I do a
blog post with my Kat Von D liquid
lipsticks and swatches soon as I found
this watch is online so helpful let me
know if you guys would be interested in
double-dare is an interesting shade it's
kind of got a bit of pink in it a bit of
brown and maybe a bit of coral as well I
think on the lips it looks really nice
actually and the tones suit my skin tone
and I'm glad I got this one it applied
really nicely just like the other darker
shades that I own they always feel a bit
wet at first then you just kiss your
lips together and they soon dry down and
they really do last for such a long time
okay in a final shade I got is Lolita
and there's Lolita and Lolita too I
looked online I think Lolita 2 looked a
little bit too like terracotta for me I
think that's what I decided in the end
Lolita is again just a nice kind of
brownie nudie movi color can you sense a
pattern here I'm really into these sort
of shades at the moment and they're all
quite similar apart from the bright
pinks I just wanted to kind of compare
and see which one I fall in love with
but I think I'm gonna love them all this
one's definitely one of my favorites I
really like it it's a little bit darker
this one could definitely be worn in the
evening as well and I find these sort of
shades are so easy to pair with just
like a mutual brown eyeshadow so yeah I
think this one's really nice as well and
I'm happy I picked that up that's
actually everything I ordered it's not
that much stuff although I did get 5
liquid lipsticks I can't believe I did
that and I still really want the Kylie
liquid lip kits if any of you guys have
tried them let me know what you think
and if they are worth obsessing over and
paying for the shipping also let me know
what else you've bought from Sephora
recently because whenever I do Sephora
order I always like to get quite a lot
so it's like worth the shipping but then
I never really know what to get so let
me know what you've picked up recently
in what you've loved I have my March
favorites video coming up on Sunday and
if you haven't seen my last video it was
a tour of my living room kind of kitchen
space so I will put that here if you
want to go and have a watch and I'll see
you guys on Sunday in my next video
thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
