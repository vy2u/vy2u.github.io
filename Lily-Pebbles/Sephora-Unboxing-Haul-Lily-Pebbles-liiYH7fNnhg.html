be doing a little the Sephora haul I
made a small order online because
Sephora now ships to the UK which is
really exciting I put all the info on
the description bar below on like how it
all works and like what charges you have
to pay except show except show but I was
pretty happy with the whole process
there were a few things that I couldn't
order like perfumes nail polishes and
bizarrely a nail buffer and just because
of shipping overseas but it came really
quickly like within a few days so that
was pretty amazing and here it is my box
of goodies and through this I can't
really remember what I ordered so I'm
just gonna open up and show you guys
what's inside right so the first thing
that's sitting right on the top if you
saw pools and when you order it you can
pick like three samples so I went for
the fresh black tea age delay I
concentrate I really like fresh the Make
Up For Ever HD definer high definition
primer I don't think I've tried a mega
Pro primer and then make it forever
pressed powder so I will be trying those
three and then everything else is in
here so pick out the rubbish oh yeah I
remembered what I got now okay first
thing if this brush and a media Aliana
always talks about this it always uses
it and it is the Sephora Pro airbrush
and she uses this foundation so let me
try and open it up I love how the
Sephora brushes come with like a little
lid I never really keep them oh I've
just checked my nail polish oh right I
have scissors Oh finally I got in yes so
this is what the products like and it's
really like long and moves a lot
compared to like my Real Techniques
buffing brush well it's really soft
though I'm really excited to try this
foundation so hopefully the media's
recommendation
be a good one Thank You Amelia for
recommending this I'm very much looking
for China the next product I'm just
going to grab out of the box is from
josie maran and this is a brand that we
can't really get in the UK my dads get
on QVC but it's definitely not like
readily available so once I do get a few
bits and this looks quite interesting
it's the Argan infinity lip and cheek
creamy oil and seen a couple of good
kind of reviews of this online I don't
really know what it is so it comes in a
little too you've got a metal tube and I
think it's basically like a tinted oil
that you can use on your lips or on your
cheek so I'm gonna try a little bit on
my hand it's quite a thick and texture
it takes quite a lot of efforts to take
out like that it's actually really quite
sheer but feels really moisturizing that
looks pretty before it's trying that
properly I also got from Josie Maran it
is Josie
or like Hosie that's probably Josie and
it you know or Josie Maran well Josie
Maran I don't know these things so this
is the color of summer I'm gonna lip and
cheek color stick set so this is like a
mini set and this is another thing I
really want to look out for this for a
website they I love the minis they do
when you're actually in Sephora in
America by the hill they have so many
great minis and we just don't do things
like that here so once they look at some
of those this has beautiful pink coral
and twinkle inside let's just pull one
out they look like these are like little
mini bombs what was nice how products
are all like confused with the argan oil
that's why they will fill product
moisturizing and oily and I think that's
a really nice idea for a brand I like
red stuff a lot of these products
probably end up being reviewed on my
blog so that's an indie pebbles Dakota
UK if you don't already read it oh man
the next thing I had to get was also an
immediately on a recommendation this
girl shopped in Sephora a lot so go to
her first for recommendations this also
has a very annoying packaging but it is
now Sephora I think it's called Rouge
really taste song ahead guys print
French cream lip stain in the shade
I don't know zero one I think it's a red
she bands on about this stuff all the
time I'm saying it's like the best
long-lasting lip ever new tried but the
back of my hand
it always looks whenever I see her she's
wearing a nice red lip it's always this
I don't think it's matte but it's very
long-lasting I just put a bit on my hand
and it looks very nice and it already
looks like it's drying in a nice way so
I'm really looking forward to trying
that and this was like the one thing I
really wanted to get so I'm happy I
picked that up the next thing in my box
of goodies is from Kat Von D I don't
think I've ever bought any of her makeup
stuff this is the everlasting liquid
lipstick and this looked pretty cool and
it's on the website yeah it's a similar
thing it comes in achieved like this and
it has like a doe foot applicator I got
this in the kind of bright raspberry
pink is this one
well it's quite pretty actually and it
feels like a very similar formula so
this Sephora one it's probably a cheaper
deep for this I wanted to try and vote
and see how they compare the next thing
I got was from Tarte
and other brand it's really hard to get
hold of here they are also now selling
on pbc but I just find it quite hard to
get hold of still so it's nice that we
can order from Sephora now this is the
sculptor contouring face
slender eyes ER and this looked pretty
cool I haven't got anything else like
this it is like a chubby stick but for
contour so it's like a brown and I want
to have a try oh it's nice it's quite
like a light brown and it blends really
easily I feel like you're just go to
town with this and you can I put it on
temples and your cheeks around your nose
and because it's quite a nice size it's
not like the nos multiple it just quite
big this is quite small it's probably
quite easy to like draw on your face I
am looking forward to trying out
properly as well I think if this is good
it could be really really good
next up and I think this is the final
statement yeah there's nothing else in
there this is from Tarte and it
if I don't even know what this is other
dogs in here the maracuja lip exfoliant
oh yeah I remember getting this ivory
light lip scrub the only one I really
have though is the fresh one so I wanted
to try something else
this comes in like Utah see if I can
figure out how in it okay so it looks
like a lip balm that's what it how could
it be a scrub oh this is really weird
it's like an oily lip balm that has like
tiny little scrubby particles in so it's
not like a sugar scrub like the fresh
one it's like a really subtle oily it's
got when it smells really minty I'm
really Minzy oh I like this I'm excited
to try the hour I feel like that's a
good one to use as an Olympics rodent
when you're out and about because the
fresh one you have to like wash off for
us this one I don't think you do that
feels nice and by the way both of these
lipsticks have already set and they look
really nice when they're dry so that
everything from Sephora my box is now
empty that was fun
I have think I would definitely order
from Sephora again it's annoying that a
lot of things they don't ship because
apart from these for you bits there
wasn't really anything else that kind of
caught my eye but it's nice to have the
option so let me know if you've tried
any of these bits I've bought and what
you think of them and also leave me your
recommendations for anything else I
should get so next time I do a Sephora
haul if you'd like to follow me on
Instagram or Twitter my username is at
little pebbles and I'm on there 24/7
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
