September favorites so I've got five or
six beauty favorites this month and then
at the end of the video I'm going to
talk about a couple of random favorites
so don't forget to watch till the end to
see those first up are a couple of face
products and first one is chanel
vitalina aqua foundation and I bought
this about a year ago and I've actually
just finished it I don't know why I
stopped using it for a few months but I
recently have fallen back in love with
it and it's just amazing I really really
love it and it will be the first
foundation that I've ever repurchase so
that's quite exciting I like to apply it
using my fingers and it's quite liquidy
you have to shake it up before you use
it but it gives amazing flawless
coverage and just makes my skin look so
good I'm wearing it today I don't know
could look any different than normal but
I just really like it at the moment my
skin has been enjoying it so I'm gonna
repurchase it using my boots points I've
been saving up I wear the shade b20
beige and it's a perfect match for me
and I know that girls with oily skin
also like this and I've got quite dried
dehydrated skin so it's obviously a
really good all-rounder next up is a
concealer product and if you watched my
New York beauty haul then you would have
seen this already I'll link that below
if you haven't seen the video but I
picked up the makeup forever full cover
waterproof concealer and as I said in my
haul video it wasn't a product that I've
ever thought about buying before because
it says full cover so I imagined it be
really heavy and cakey but it's not at
all it's amazing it works great under
the eyes because I get quite dark
circles so it's good that it's full
coverage for that and it works really
well on blemishes as well
it's not at all cakey it's actually
quite chewy and moisturizing I use my
finger just to kind of dab it Pat it in
and then blend out the edges if I need
to but I don't really do too with shade
5 which I actually went back and got
another shade because originally I
bought shades 6 and it was a bit too
yellowy for me but shade 5 is the
perfect match they have loads of shades
as well which is really good and yeah I
really like this don't be put off by the
full covered description because it's
not taking your heavy it's just amazing
it's really good if you want to have one
of those minimal foundation days because
you can just use concealer to cover up
any blemishes next up is a perfume and
it's actually one you can't get in the
UK I bought this recently in the South
of France in a stalk wood reminiscence
and my mom and I have loved this shop
through
is it's beautiful jewelry store but they
also do perfume and I know they have
stores in Italy and Belgium and
Switzerland but they don't have any in
the UK which is a shame but I bought
this perfume called REM and Beau and
this is the handbag size they have kind
of a hundred-million 50ml version and I
love this it's a mango scented perfume
but it's not too sweet I haven't smelled
anything like it whenever I saw mango
perfumes they're always really sweet and
overpowering and that's not the sort of
perfume I like at all but this one has
like something about it this it's not
too sweet but it's just delicious I love
it and I really like the packaging it's
really good for a handbag and you have
been loving this so if you're ever in
France or Italy and you see a
reminiscent it's definitely going
because they do really pretty jewelry as
well a mascara I have been absolutely
loving this month is a new launch from
Tom Ford and it's the ultra length of
mascara and me and Ruth from a model
recommends had a bit of a moment the
other day in a caliber we were having a
hissy fit over how amazing this mascara
is she's also a big fan and it's just
amazing first of all of the handle is
weighted so it's like perfectly weighted
when you apply a mascara but the formula
is just amazing and the brush this
actually I think eats my Clinique um
mascara which I did a blog post say is
the best mascara ever I still love it
but I think this one is actually better
it's just so lengthening it gives
amazing volume and it's one of those
mascara is it requires very little
effort you just kind of brush your
lashes well that's what it does on me
anyway and I'm wearing it today and I've
been using it everyday fall in love with
it
it's very pricey it's about 34 pounds
which is just crazy but if that's in
your budget then I'd really recommend
getting this now I know I mentioned
butter LONDON in my last favorites video
but they've just got so many good colors
and this month I've been obsessed with
this white nail polish it's just a pure
white it's actually called cotton buds I
didn't know that that's a cute name and
I've been obsessed with black and white
this month with my clothes with my nails
with my shoes everything obsessed and so
I've just loved painting my nails white
I actually got this idea from Amelia
Jana she did a blog post on white nails
and since then I've been obsessed I've
been trying to create some nail art
using black and white and yeah my nails
pretty much been white everyday poppin
today they're pink this is also butter
LONDON actually I can't remember the
name but I'll put it in the disc
box below I just think white is really
chic on the nails and it means that you
can kind of wear anything clothes wise
and it will always match my last beauty
favorites is this makeup brush from
zoeva in its number two to eight crease
brush and this is amazing it's about
five pounds I think I'm trying to work
out the euros something wrapped like
five or six pounds and it's amazing it's
it's basically a tapered crease brush
but I find this really good because you
can use it in so many different ways you
can use it on its side and apply to a
whole lid you can use it that way and
use it in your crease and you can also
use as a blending brush it's kind of
just like a three-in-one and if I
compare it to a couple of other brushes
so you can see compared to the Mac t17
is a lot longer and more tapered and
less kind of flat and compared to the
Mac two to four it's smaller and
narrower and less fluffy so you can kind
of get more precision and I just love it
this has become one of my favorite ever
makeup brushes and it's so affordable it
cleans quite well it is starting to kind
of fray a bit at the edges but it's so
cheap I've already just kind of
repurchase another one when it dies and
I love it it's just perfect every time I
use it I'm like yes this is such a good
brush it's so good for the crease you
can really kind of get in and put some
kind of definition in there so being
loving this so for my random favorites
the first one is a youtuber and blogger
and it's Patricia Patricia bright her
YouTube channel is bricked pop princess
which I always struggle with to say it's
like a tongue twister but it's pop
princess proper I can't say it fast
I just can't anyway and her blog it's
called moments of style and as you saw
in my vlogs I went to New York with her
and Anna and I've been getting to know
her over the last month and she's just
the most loveliest of girls ever she's
so positive and uplifting and inspiring
to be around and I just love her pretty
much got a girl crush on her her blog is
amazing she does more fashion than
beauty and she's got such good stars
gave me so many good tips and she's just
amazing so I'm gonna link her YouTube
and her blog below and if you haven't
been already which I'm sure you have
because she's amazing then you
definitely should go check around my
second round and favorite is River
Island and River Island it's a shop I
don't normally go to because I feel like
they always have ours like literally
like ours written all over their clothes
and I think it's so tacky but I
recently in like a last-minute panic
what to wear for Fashion Week and I
found so many good things like with no
arse on them I loved it
they just have that they're having a
real moment for me at the moment and
I've got loads of stuff I bought this
top from there which is like sheer and
it's got like last gated wrists and it
really kind of sporty but I don't know I
wore it tucked into a skirt a fashion
week and I've got a few other bits here
to show you just quickly with this
jumper which says Paris and everything's
black and white just a warning because
I'm having a black-and-white moment I
did a blog post on this so I'll link
that below but I've got this sweater and
I also bought these two cardigans which
I've just been loving you can wear them
as jackets and layer underneath and this
one's just black and they both have like
tight arms and then they're really baggy
which I find really useful and this one
which you would have seen in my new
video
and so yeah River Island is in my good
books at the moment I found loads of
good stuff so you should go and check it
out if you haven't been recently so
those are my September favorites I
really hope you've enjoyed it seen them
please comment on this video and let me
know what some of your favorites have
been this month and I'll see you in my
next video bye so I thought that now in
September summer's kind of finished
coming to an end I thought I'd kind of
look back and talk about the things that
I've been wearing and using most</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
