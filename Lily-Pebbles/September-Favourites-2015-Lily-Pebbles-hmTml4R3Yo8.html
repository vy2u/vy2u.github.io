September favorites and I know this is
kind of strange for it to be coming out
on a Thursday normally I do these videos
on a Sunday but I have a special video
coming on Sunday that I've been working
really hard on for quite a while so I've
had to squeeze my favorites in a midweek
but it's also gonna be quite a short one
so I'm gonna get started by talking
through a few skincare bits I've been
loving
I've been trying out quite a few things
from pixie recently and I really like
pixie as a brand I feel like the
packaging is a bit misleading it kind of
looks a bit cheap and young and childish
but it's actually really really good and
the quality of their products is amazing
I quite like the makeup I feel like I
haven't fallen in love with the makeup
but the skincare is so good and
obviously my friend Caroline hyerin's
highly recommends it so I really trust
the quality a couple of products that I
have been loving first of all the beauty
sleep cream this is a nighttime
moisturizer it says night recovery cream
buttery texture infuses skin with
moisture fast absorbing nutrient-rich
gentle and soothing this is incredible
stuff it's like it's quite thick but not
too thick but it's just got this like
silky texture to it it's unlike anything
I've tried it just kind of glides onto
the skin and just make some skin feel so
moisturized and nourished and I
absolutely love it I love the packaging
it's great for traveling and this is
very quickly becoming my new favorite
nighttime moisturizer I also really like
a trio skin drink this is like a shot of
hydration and I put this with my makeup
but I use this just before I do my
makeup kind of like a primer I don't
think this helps your makeup actually
last longer but it definitely hydrates
the skin and for me my makeup disappears
because my skin drinks the makeup
because it's so dehydrated so it's like
a little barrier of hydration between my
skin and my makeup
it feels great it's a little bit like
silicone II but not too much I don't
like silicone II feeling primers it's
there thirsty skin relief intense
moisture gel it's the Neve rehydrate
skin lightweight refreshing plumping and
cooling I agree it is all of those
things I've also been trying out a lot
of products from Kate Somerville I
previously what I've been to America
bought a few things from her range the
goat milk moisturizer I really like I
bought them nourished moisturizer last
time which is more of a gel and I didn't
like that as much so I've gone back to
the goat milk but they very kindly sent
me a few products to try and the one
really stood out for me is the exfoliate
that's kind of a ridiculous name but
this is an intensive exfoliating
treatment this is very similar to the oh
man what does that product called again
it's like an orange exfoliating mask
that Anna really likes from Thomas Roth
I think it's called and it's a bit like
that but I wasn't a huge fan of that
mask cuz I found it kind of stung my
skin it was a bit too intense for me but
it's got a kind of pumpkin enzyme feel
to it and this is very similar but it
doesn't sting it's green it's not orange
and you work it into the skin
exfoliating with your hands for about 30
seconds which is quite a long time you
give yourself a little Facebook facial
massage and then you leave it on for
about three minutes as there's or as
long as you can be bothered to wait and
it made my skin feel so smooth
exfoliated in the perfect way and and I
just love when it's my skin and I love
that it didn't hurt so it's fine I think
if you've got sensitive skin but it's
still like intense enough to do its job
I really like this exfoliator I've only
got one makeup product in this
favourites which is crazy for me but
it's the illamasqua skin based
foundation I got this a few weeks ago
maybe a month ago and I've been pretty
much using it every time I do my makeup
I really like the squeezie cheeze
packaging I like that you can kind of
customize this to how much coverage you
want I've either been mixing it with my
Estee Lauder CC cream so I do kind of a
big splurge of that and then put a tiny
bit of this and mix it together that's
what I've been doing most days for like
a tinted moisturizer look but then if
you use this alone you can really build
it up and make it quite a full coverage
foundation so I feel like that you can
really use this however you want to use
it it's undetectable on the skin it
gives you really nice glowy skin without
being too Chloe I feel like most people
will like this it's just one of those
foundations very unoffensive and kind of
does what you want it to do for the home
I have been loving the white company
fresh fake collection I every time I go
in to store I check like is this limited
edition because if it is I really need
to stock up but they say they don't know
so hopefully it's not hopefully as a
permanent scent the scent is called
fresh speak and it's cassis vetiver and
fig so I've got the home spray which is
really nice if you just want to quickly
make your lounge or whatever smell good
but I've also got the sticks
probably remember is cooled but you
basically have the Senate
here you put the sticks in every now and
again if you just turn mistakes it just
scents the room gradually and lightly
it's very subtle I love the smell it's
like it's a really green type of fig
scent it's a bit like philosopher's
dippity perfume I really like it I think
there's a candle as well I would
recommend going into store and giving it
a smile yourself because you'll want to
buy the whole range okay the last thing
I'm sorry this is so quick
there are things from Ikea and I've
wanted these kind of shelves for so long
West Elm do them but IKEA also do them
and they are a lot cheaper and I was
really excited when I told her that I
here do them there's a couple of
different variations so these kind of
shelves that you secure into the wall
like this and then they've got a little
ledge and you can basically lean any
pictures on it and I've been using these
everywhere I've got this one which is
kind of a bit narrow and then I've also
got this one which is a little bit
thicker I've used the thick one where
I've got like a few pictures and I've
also used this in my hallway to put like
letters and keys on I've decided to kind
of use these everywhere instead of
putting a picture up on the wall and
this is a painting I feel like I prefer
to put something like this up and then
if I change my mind I'm sort of person
they will get bored of seeing the same
picture in the same place all the time
if you change your mind you can just
take them off you're not securing
anything to the wall and you can kind of
switch your pictures up move them around
rooms if you get a new one you can
switch it so I feel like that's a really
good idea it looks nice as well you can
use it for other things as I said I use
the big one in my hallway we've put like
a little letter stand and we put our
keys there and I think they're a really
fun way to kind of decorate your walls
it looks small I like to see the
pictures laid out next to each other I
haven't put them all up yet but I'm
gonna put one above my chest of drawers
and one above my desk and we've got a
big one in our lounge so that was
probably my quickest favourites video
I've ever done but hopefully next month
I will have more because I'm already
getting back into using my skincare and
makeup now I've got new makeup storage
Oh actually that's another favorite my
Urban Outfitters
makeup chest of drawers things probably
not meant for makeup I ordered this
quite a while ago when I went to visit
Alan Brighton I told her I was like look
what I ordered she was like no way I've
literally put that in a blog post for
next week so it's a bit crazy how like
psychic we are but we both fell in love
with it mark wouldn't let her order that
one says she got a different one in the
end but I really liked it
there was a massive drama with the
delivery because it came all in one and
the guy couldn't lift up the stairs if
you watched my vlogs he probably would
know about this already but now that
it's here and it's open and I filled it
with my makeup I love it the drawers are
the perfect kind of depth they're not
too deep so that it's kind of a waste of
space and they're long enough for most
things to fit as well I keep everything
in there makeup hair care haven't even
filled all the drawers yet so I'm gonna
keep all it's kind of sorting that out
properly and putting it in order of how
I want it I just love it I love that
style of like apothecary drawers so I
say apothecary I think so anyway thank
you so much for watching this video guys
and I will see you on Sunday for my next
video see you then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
