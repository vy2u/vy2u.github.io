process of moving so as you would have
seen in Tuesday's vlog I've been sorting
out my bedroom so it's not my office
getting rid of any clothes that I
haven't worn in like over a year and
I've been sorting through my makeup as
well I haven't yet tackled my bathroom
that's a whole nother story but as you
would have seen in the vlog I did tackle
my makeup drawers and I got rid of any
old out-of-date makeup and I had a huge
giveaway pile as well for friends and
family so if you're relatively new to
youtube you may not know about shop my
stash videos they're quite an old-school
type of video here on YouTube and it's
basically when you rediscover old
favorites products that you used to love
and wear all the time you kind of just
forgot about and whilst clearing through
all my makeup I picked up quite a few
products that I want to mention in this
video basically any time that I saw a
product and went oh oh I love that then
I'd put it in the pile for this video so
that's kind of how it works
first thing isn't that old but I just
kind of forgot I had this and it's Estee
Lauder day wear SPF 50 I really love
this stuff it smells kind of cucumber
refresh and it's got a slight green tint
to it so it's good if you've got any
redness and this is just a really nice
lightweight SPF I put it on before my
makeup and I'm really happy that I
rediscovered this because I really like
this and I just kind of forgot to use it
I got rid of so many foundations but I
kept the ones that I really like and one
of them is the Chanel Vita Lumia aqua I
haven't worn this for like over a year
the shade I have is 20 beige which is a
little bit dark for me at the moment
which is strange but this is just such a
nice formula I haven't tried anything
else like it you shake it up and it's
very like liquidy but then when you put
it on the skin it kind of like melts
into the skin you and you need a tiny
amount and it goes really far I hate
applying this with a brush but with my
hands and fingers it's so nice and
natural it gives a really good amount of
coverage and a nice amount of glow and
this has just always been one of my
favorites but I just forget to use it I
kind of get stuck using another one and
then forget to go back to this but I'm
happy that I dug out of my drawers
lashes are definitely the thing that I
have most of I found it so hard to get
rid of blushes I just don't know why but
I'm obsessed with blushes and they were
two that I wanted to mention in this
video that I haven't spoken about in a
while and that I used to absolutely love
the first one is from Becca and this is
called flower child I don't even
remember buying this but it's just a
really pretty peachy pink blusher and I
remember going through like five months
solid
just wearing this every day I feel like
Becker's have ever come back now since
the whole Jaclyn Hills champagne pop
highlighter so if you are looking to buy
something else from Becca I'd really
recommend the flower child blush very
pretty also on the whole kind of peachy
pink vibes this one's a bit more of a
peach this is from Stila and it's one of
their convertible color dual lip and
cheek creams and this is in Joburg I
remember my mom used to use this all the
time and I bought it a couple years ago
maybe it's a cream blusher it's very
natural and this is a really nice one to
wear when you're like on the beach or if
you go on holiday somewhere warm you can
use this on your lips or your cheeks but
this color is a bit too light for my
lips these are just so versatile and so
gooey they make your cheeks look like
plump and glossy and really pretty I
just love this blusher before the whole
jaclyn hill champagne pop highlight on
fleek thing this was the original
highlight on fleek product this is from
dior and it's the my god firm what it's
called amber diamond oh my god I looked
everywhere for this this was sold out
for so long I think Tanya burr mentioned
it and then everyone went wild everyone
once a day and I really hope this is
still available I don't know if it is
but it's a highlighter that starts from
really light color and it goes kind of
bronzy I tend to just kind of smoosh my
brush around and take all the colors
it's a beautiful highlight I just put on
the tops of my cheekbones it's not quite
as pigmented as champagne pop which
you'd literally have to like tap your
brush on you do kind of have to swallow
your brush in a bit but that might be
because this is quite old but I love it
the original beautiful highlighter that
I first fell in love with and this this
product makes me excited I found a few
eyeshadows that I was like oh I want to
use those so the first one is from Stila
and it's kitten this is such a
well-known eyeshadow it's in a lot of
their palettes I've just got the kind of
single eyeshadow it's really really
shimmery and it's so nice to put in the
inner corner of your eye or to apply as
a base before you apply darker shadows
it's ridiculously pigmented like you
only need to tap your brush on a tiny
amount you can definitely use this as a
highlighter as well it's like a golden
ooh peach it's actually really similar
to champagne pop I don't know why I'm
referring to that with every products
but it's obviously on my brain at the
moment but it is very similar just like
in eyeshadow form and then the L'Oreal
infallible shadows eye
obsessed with these when they came out
and I haven't used them in such a long
time so I wanted to use them in this
video this shade is amber rush which
when I bought it I think it was only
available in America but I'm not sure
now if you can get it here or not but
this is my favorite shade from the
collection it's like a rose gold it's so
pretty all over the lid and you could
just wear this by itself it's beautiful
the packaging is quite cool it comes in
this little pot and with like a press
it's like a pressed pigment to just take
that off and it's not
I hate loose pigment it's so messy it's
not messy at all because it's kind of
compacted down the other shade that I
really like is bronze taupe and this is
quite dark compared to what I usually
wear but in the crease and slightly
under the eye it's really nice and it it
blends in well with kind of lighter
golden Browns finally for my lips this
lipstick I was so obsessed with when I
first got it it's from Illamasqua it's
good magnetism and it's a berry like a
purpley berry color I like to apply it
with a lip brush and then Pat it in the
tissue apply it straight from the bullet
and then Pat it in again so it really
works into the lips and you can apply it
lightly so it's just a soft stain or
have where it really bold which is also
really pretty it's such a nice little
tunnel shade yeah I'd probably got about
half a lipstick left I wore this to
death for like a year I don't even think
it was last autumn I think it was the
one before that I hope this hasn't like
gone off I don't want to know the whole
deal would like keep your makeup I tend
to just kind of look at it give it a
smell and if it looks alright I'll keep
it but this is such a pretty berry shade
I love wearing purpley berry tones on my
lips and it's not a matte lipstick it's
kind of moisturizing it doesn't kind of
snow over my face though so those are
the products that I've fallen back in
love with I really enjoyed doing like a
shop my stash kind of videos very
old-school and maybe it's inspired you
guys to have a clear out of your makeup
because you might find products that you
use the love and you haven't used in a
while I think it's nice to do it every
now and again thank you so much for
watching this video and I'll see you
guys on Sunday I think it should be a
beauty chat video on Sunday so I'll see
you then 9:30 a.m. UK time and have a
good rest of your week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
