shopping in Westfield and Oxford Street
a bit so I thought I'd film a quick hall
it was actually really meant to be a
shopping day we just went to Westfield
because it was a bit of a rainy cold day
when we wanted to get out but not be
outside so um we went to rice field me
and rich and i went into the lush store
not massive fan of lush I find a lot of
their things smell too kind of sweet for
me in a bit chemically which is weird
cuz I think they're supposed to be kind
of organic ii but but to me a lot of
their stuff smells like chemicals but
there are feelings that are like and I'd
really like this or seasonal things a
Halloween Christmas always go and kind
of check those out so I wanted to go
have a look um held my breath as i went
in because the stores smells so
overpowering and but the main thing i
was going in for was the vanilla
fountain bath bomb which i absolutely
love it's just my favorite and they said
they've discontinued them so i'm so
upset i think i saw my website they're
still selling them so i might get
something the website i'm really upset
and they didn't really have any
alternatives that were as good they
showed me a few that they said was
similar but none of them really had
vanilla in and that was what i liked
about it so i think that's a real shame
if discontinued that but i got a few
things so just in his little bag and
I'll show you what off first thing I've
never actually got shower gel from lush
I've smelt most of them and none of them
really kind of tickled my fancy but I
gave this one a go off the same Fleur
and talk about it and this is ponch or
ponche I'm not really sure how you
pronounce that oh and it says it's with
orange juice and a shot of tequila
inspired by traditional Mexican
Christmas punch this shower gel is
bright boozy fruity and uplifting so
this is just a small one which I thinks
about 4 pounds or five pounds umm this
is nice it's just kind of refreshing and
citrusy and I just want to kind of give
it a go I need a new shower gel anyway I
haven't really got any on the go at the
moment
loving so I'm going to put this in my
shower and give it a go and for my first
lunch shower gel hopefully we won't kind
of bring you out any rashes or anything
I'm normally okay with things like that
my skin isn't that sensitive oh I also
got all the melting snowman this is a
massage farm and let me just open it
without completely ripping the packaging
actually you like how they will comment
individual brush so this looks like this
and it doesn't actually say they used to
say on the label sort of what the
ingredients and stuff but they don't
seem to do that anymore but from what I
remember I've got this one last year i
think these bits actual real chocolate
which is nice and it just is a really
clean it is a massage bar by sony
normally just kind of when I'm in the
bath I'll put it in the bath and like
rub it on my skin oh no fireworks that's
gonna be really annoying in this video
sorry someone seems to be heavy fire
works next door yeah so i just woke us
on my skin it's really creamy and
moisturizing has already got a strong
scent apparently i think panic this year
they've made it a bit more spicy than it
normally is like actually smells a
little bit cinnamony i'm not a massive
cinnamon fan but it's not that strong i
think yes because lastly i think it
didn't ring have a sense and that's
probably why they've done that but it's
really nice it just makes your skin feel
ready softer and its really cute little
melting snowman so I like that one the
next thing from the lodge which is the
last thing I only got through things is
the bubble beard reusable bubble bar and
I'm sure you've seen this already I
think everyone's for this one this it's
really cute and it's near and it
basically looks like this it's a little
moustache so that's really cute Oh
actually Morgan doesn't really look like
imma start this side but you basically
just swallow this in the bath and it
makes bubbles and then you can reuse it
let me show how I guess you have to kind
of leave it on the side and and hope
that doesn't melt away but yeah it just
it's really cute and they have a style
one like this
I've never used one of these so excited
to try it and it's for Movember well I
think it's from my phone but my dad
actually might be Movember if you don't
all that is google it you grow a
mustache in November to raise money for
charity so I spot this and i think is
right cute so that's everything from
lush and i also before I gone to my
Primark stuff got a few other bits in
westfield and first thing was his top
phone pull and bear i promised the girl
who told me that I wouldn't tell her
what about it because pulling bears kind
of like a secret place but don't go to
put a very inviting oh but the top is so
nice and I really wanted to show you and
so it looks like this it's got a really
cute collar and its really kind of like
thick and sturdy it's got little silver
button things and spikes as well so the
collar goes all the way around the back
and then it's a three-quarter length
sleeve and kind of just a normal top and
it's quite thick it feels like a jumper
but not too thick that you can wear
underneath like a jumper so yeah I just
really like the collar and I've never
actually found a top i always find
college i really like but then I don't
like the top that it's attached to so
this is like the first time I've really
found the top with a collar that I like
both so I'm really excited to wear this
and this was 25 pounds i think and which
i think it's all right for a top like
this so I'm really excited about that
and looking forward to wearing it
and I also wanted to urban outfitters
looked some clothes and stuff really
nice but I find urban outfitters just so
expensive so I'd only only go in as a
sale but I went to the book section and
actually rich my boyfriend found this
and chaos dead said Allah this is really
interesting and I I don't know but I
went oh yeah and it's great because
normally brings up like the most
ridiculous things and I'm like yeah
looks really great but this one actually
was quite interesting so it's called
blog ink and it's by joy I can't say her
surname but the blow her blogs called oh
joy and if what we heard of it and it's
just a book about it says blogging for
passion profit and create community and
I normally don't i don't buy blogging
books i've never had before mine rich
water button first thing I said to him
was when was it written because normally
these books were written three years ago
and then it's so quickly out of date
because blogging world changes so
quickly but this was written this year
and I just looked at sort of the titles
and it's looks quite interesting
actually and I just think I'd really
want to read it and there's ten pounds I
thought why not actually rich boy bought
it for me in the end as a present
because I'll but more don't win spend
ten pounds on it and it just seems
really interesting look it up online I
mean it's got like example I interview
with Emily Schumann from cupcakes and
cashmere which is one of my favorite
blogs that the first blogger ever found
and so I kind of just I just found
myself in this in the shop like just
reading it and I think when that happens
you know you need to buy or when you get
quite into region it in the shop so
looking forward to try and match Leah
and then the next thing is actually a
Christmas present I wasn't meaning to go
out bikers my present day but I saw this
and just had to get it so this is my
sister Carly so if you're watching
please turn off now but they want you to
see your Christmas present right turn
off and so this is where I got her she's
really really into her food and loves
cook clean and stuff actually she might
be doing a guest post on my blog cuz I
do food posts on Saturdays so she might
be doing a guest post soon so look out
for that I'm Sonia this is where I got
hurt it's a lonely planet book and it's
called the world's best street food
where to find it and how to make it it's
really cool it's basically
we paid as a different country and a
different like famous dish so for
example let me find one ah here's a good
one Israel falafel so on this side of
the page you'll say what it is how
you're supposed to eat it and the origin
of it like the history behind the food
and where you can find it and they give
some actual recommendations of
restaurants as well and then on the
other side little recipe on how to make
it and that's literally for every page
is Jeff pork from Jamaica there's new
york Egypt main Lebanon Australia
Malaysia literally there's so many cool
it's all like really cool street food so
I think this is really i mean i've kind
of want this but i give it to her then
maybe she'll cook the food for me so i
think that's really cool if you know you
want things like inter food and stuff I
got this from urban outfitters but I'm
pretty sure you can get on Amazon
probably for cheaper as well and not
going to say how much this was just in
case she's actually watching I don't
want her to know how much I spend on
their Christmas present more than we're
supposed to be spending we normally have
a budget and but yeah that's a really
cool book so the next thing is my
Primark stuff now i'm not a Primark girl
I'm always really jealous of people that
find good stuff in Primark I get really
impatient when I'm in there for me
shopping half of its but actually the
shopping experience so I don't enjoy
shopping in Primark because it's busy
and hot and smelly and stressful also
don't love the quality if I like a lot
of the clothes fall apart like we cuffed
you get them so I mainly get accessories
and things and I love the christmas
stuff so i went to the new one and
Tottenham Court Road and it's actually
really nice it's three floors and it's
quite calm and it wasn't that busy we
didn't have to queue ages for the till
so it was quite a pleasant primark
shopping experience today and but this
is what I got first thing standard for
Primark is socks such a good place to
buy socks to pound fifty i'm not picky
with my socks and so i'm happy to get
myself some fine work I just got some
plain black ones because Ronnie says but
i also got Christmas ones which I'm
really excited
I got some thermal Christmas socks is
just Santo and then like striped ones
and these the ones with the grippy bits
on the bottom I wear these that night
when I'm watching TV and on the sofa and
these are so cozy i love them and then
some more kind of normal socks well
they're the cotton rich ones are a bit
thicker than normal and they kind of got
Christmas like Santa Christmas chi Ã¨
trees and stripes and that nice
Christmas you print and just lows
there's like five pairs in here I think
so I love those I really intellect
Christmassy print things see a little
white trichome is rich to get Christmas
John phone he won't get 1 i'm really
upset I want him to work with some
strong and then I also got some slippers
and I know it enough sleepers are
normally like Christmas presents but I
don't really want to wait to the same
book is cold already so these just kind
of blue and white they look massive if I
did get large but I'm 6 like six and a
half so I am a large I guess but I don't
like small slip and then quite Ferrari
inside so it will be smaller than they
look and so yet blue and white with kind
of fur lining fur all the way inside and
then there's cute kind of stitching
around the bottom which is quite nice
I'm literally going to put those on as
soon as I finish this video they're
really comfy I haven't said how much I
said I wash your socks are the slippers
are six pounds which is quite good
slippers and then the last thing I got
into these leggings but I'm not going to
wear them as leggings I'm going to wear
them as pajamas because I sometimes I
like wearing tight pajamas because it
kind of lets less air in and it's more
cozy and just kind of language where
these are seven pounds and they're black
and white and they just have this quite
big actually a lot size I got 12
Madeline but I have this print and
they're quite long which I like quite
long legs so I hate when leg is quite
short and yeah I just thought these are
kind of cute and comfy for home soccer
growing these like a big baggy jumper I
haven't found a good Christmas jumper
yeah that's next on my list and they
actually had some really good ones in
the men's department like reindeer
and cheese but I get whenever I see like
loads of really nice things I get
overwhelmed end up getting nothing I had
really really good kids wear stuff I
wanted to get my nieces and nephews some
christmas jumpers but they were all so
cute i couldn't actually decide and
ended up leaving with nothing so I'm not
very good when I see lots of things I
like so yeah that's all I got um kind of
a bit of a random haul not writing me as
well like Primark and lush two places I
don't go to very often but I just wanted
to come back and quickly show you what I
got so I can put them all on and take
the tags off and wear them so if you
like see what I bought and i'll see you
in my next video thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
