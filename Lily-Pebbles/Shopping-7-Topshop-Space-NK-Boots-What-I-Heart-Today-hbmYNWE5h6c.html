reason unknown to me I just decided I
really wants to film a video I actually
am trying to film or what's in my
handbag video on Friday but it just came
out really badly you know sometimes that
happens and I wanted to get a video up
for you tonight so I thought I'd do kind
of a mini haul and there's really not
that much stuff but I bought a few
things over the past few weeks and I
Westfield yesterday so i thought i'd
show you I got I've got a topshop bag
and a little basket full of some goodies
so I'm gonna start with Topshop it's
just one and this is a personal shopping
bag I went to my friend Deb's is a
personal shopper in the top shop in
westfield and i always go to see how
when i go there so you should really go
it's great it's a free appointment and
you just basically get to go into the
really nice spacious changing rooms and
they'll get you different sizes of
things that they think will cpu and it's
just really nice relaxing and then you
get to skip the queue when you want to
pay which is really good and so I got
these trousers devs actually picked
these out for me they're not something I
would have picked for myself which is
another reason why I was like going to
see her um and I actually bought them
thinking I'm going to come home and try
them on with the clothes I have to
decide but i'm pretty sure i'm going to
keep them they are black and and they've
got a zip up side and no pocket so they
kind of look a bit like leggings but
they're thick enough to be Charles's and
so they're black and they roll up at the
bottom and then kind of velvet and
feeling which I don't love velvet but I
don't mind this and they've got a wonder
if you can see the print it's kind of I
think it's called dog teeth print but
they just fit really nicely they're
really really tight and I've got quite
skinny legs so i always find quite hard
to find charger jeans that are actually
tight on me and stay tight and i really
like these so they just look like that i
got size 10 I'm normally a 12 so they
obviously come up quite big and
recommending the size smaller yeah I'm
just looking forward to wearing these I
probably wear them with longer tops
before because they're probably look
cool with top stop
but because there's no pockets I find
they look a bit like leggings and I'd it
out I'll probably wear tops like long
tops over them but you like this there
were 28 pounds topshop is just getting
more and more expensive now onto a few
other random bits and i'll show you my
beauty bits I got a couple of note pads
from Paper Chase and I just thought
these really cute I've written you too
Dan blog so i can use them for my
youtube and blog and obviously pink and
bright yellow and i just think they're
very nice plain sort of lined pads and
they're really handy I don't know how
much they were but didn't they were
expensive I also popped into Primark the
other evening after having dinner with
Anna for Viviana does makeup we always
end up shopping some recent and I got a
few bits i'm not going to show you one
of them because you'll see it in a video
soon but the main thing i went there for
with these super cozy tights and they
actually called to super cozy tights and
i get this every year they're just the
best things ever when it's cold they're
thick tights and they're kind of like
lined with like kind of like fur it's
just really soft and I'm not joking when
you wear this I will be when it's
snowing last year you can't even feel
when it's so that icy cold wind you
can't feel it at all on your legs and
they're so warm and stretchy and
comfortable and they're like three
pounds that the best tights that ever
bought and so I always gave to Primark
to get those um okay now all the rest is
beauty stuff so the first two I think I
showed these in my makeup tutorial video
I bought a couple more Real Techniques
brushes and I've been looking for you
everywhere I found it quite hard to find
them I just couldn't find them anywhere
and I wasn't like kind of mad rush to
find them but I always went to look and
they were just never there but then I
saw them in Bond Street boots I think
and this is the setting brush and the
expert face brush so the setting brush
is like a really small little pointed
fluffy brush which is good for powder
under the eyes you can also use a
concealer it's kind of quite a good
multi-purpose brush I mean all the Real
Techniques brushes are but I like this
one for empowered of the mpi because
when I wear powder it's not
normally all over my face is normally
just under my eyes where I really want
to like set by concealer so I really
like that as a tiny little brush which
is good to keep in your makeup bag and
the expert face brush I didn't think
that I needed this it's very similar to
the buffing brush well it looked it and
kind of short stumpy brush actually
actually it's quite different now teased
it and it's obviously a lot more
narrower it's not as round as the
buffing brush but it's also a lot softer
feel with the buffing brush when you use
it on foundation it really kind of makes
the foundation a full coverage it makes
it quite heavy which is why I kind of
went back to me using my stippling brush
I think this is actually meant for
Korean products but I've used it on
liquid foundation as well and it's
really nice it's just much softer and
smoother and gives a much more like
airbrush feel um I really like it
because it's kind of more narrow I like
that you can use it straight on to buff
but then you can use the size to get
into like these bits here and all the
little hard bits to get to I really like
this actually I've been enjoying using
this a lot and so I'd recommend getting
that and it comes in his own which is
good for people who wanted the buffing
brush but didn't want to buy the core
collection I'd recommend getting this
one i also got um i don't know if any of
you guys watched isa elders this video I
love Lisa Eldridge and she did a video
on red lipsticks and she said that the
longest lasting red lipstick she's ever
worn is Maybelline 14 hour where so
that's amazing i obviously went straight
out to try and find it and i bought the
same color that she recommended which is
non-stop read a kind of bit cheap
packaging but it's Maybelline I love the
color but um so does printed I came out
with a massive reaction to this lipstick
I'm not allergic to anything I'm not an
allergic person but I wore this on
Friday and since then pretty much the
afternoon I've got the driest lips from
like here to here on my top lip I have
massive dry patch and literally I'm
having me out to a lipstick for three
days I've been using this the only thing
that's helped is this nukes reve de miel
lip balm I've tried eight hour cream
I've tried lupus poor poor I tried every
bomb and so bomb that I own and I had
the driest lip and it was so painful and
it was awful and I think it's fun this
lipstick which is so annoying because I
really like the color but I'm not
willing to risk it again because my lips
have just been in so much pain for the
past few days and I call wear lipstick
now I'm just having to put lip balm on
so that's a shame I think the colors
really nice so I don't know I don't know
why I to be allergic to this foot space
gallery but and i also got i went in
space NK I've got a spacing km like
loyalty card now which is just so bad
because it makes me want to spend more I
been seeing this foundation everywhere
it's the laura mercier silk creme
foundation kate from ghost parties talks
about it Tanya burr wears it amarixe
where is it I just always seen and I've
always looked at swatches and always
watched YouTube videos I've always had
this fascination with it but never
bought it it's like 33 pounds so it's
very expensive quite an investment I
really wanted to try it i went to a few
counters to ask it thinking me a sample
and they don't i just think it's crazy
when cancers then give you samples of
foundation because personally i need to
try on my face at home with the brushes
i normally use or how I normally do it
to see how it looks because even when I
try and store which is very rare i want
to go into a store no makeup on it's not
real life situation i need to try on at
home and see what i think of it so it's
a few counts as they wouldn't give me a
sample eventually i took a pot with me
selfridges and the lady was so so rude
to me but in the end she gave me a
little bit the tiny little squeeze into
a pot I went home and tried it the thing
is I've always been put off about this
because it says it's a full coverage
foundation and I don't wear full
coverage I we're quite light and sheer
foundations but it's not really i don't
know why they say that i think you could
probably build up to a full coverage but
when i wear it it's quite dewey and it
is heavier than a lot of funny as I have
I think if you only I just a tightly
literally put a tiny bit dance into my
face and I use the stippling brush I
like that brush because it kind of gives
a life to coverage and its really nice
and it's really glowy and wearing it now
I'm housing
ospf which is normally a bad thing but
if you watch my last video where I
thought my wise L foundation had no SPF
but then found out it did it's quite
nice to have at least one foundation
that doesn't so you can wear it for
nights out so this is going to be like
no SPF foundation I got the shade cream
ivory which is literally perfect color
match for me and yet said three pounds
everyone was saying no it's worth it
will last you forever which I'm sure it
will I just remembered that I'm going
away in January to Thailand for two
weeks and probably gonna get very tanned
and then I would be able to wear this
for about six months so that's shame
I've got about a month of wearing this
before I can't wear it until I'm back to
this color again that's really annoying
um but yeah I like it anyway i like the
little tube and i'm glad i got it I've
got two more things first one is safe
from Lori a phone call body wash I love
this packaging I love having a big pump
in my shower and the only thing I don't
love about I was it a no and I bought
this and I said to her quite like trying
new things all the time so I feel like
this girl asked me for ages but I told
rich you can share it with me so I'm
sure we'll go through it quite quickly
and i'm not the biggest open lori fair
enough a lot of their products are
really kind of too sweet for me i'm not
big sweet scent lover but this one says
it has peppermint essential oils grape
seed fruit liquid fig and orange water
juice so it's not figuring it and you
guys know I love fake my tip teeth and
German and perfumes a fig and this is
really nice it's true it does smell it
fig and I kind of grapefruit and it's
just a much more kind of mature I love
the smell actually I'm really surprised
thats a fan blowing through this smell
is just so on them I love this so I
recommend going to smell it if you're
not massive soap &amp;amp; Glory fat and you
find their products you sweet this ones
are really good and yeah it's really
cute packaging as usual and I don't
think that was expensive there was like
a 342 thing of boots but I didn't need
three things so I just got this and then
the last thing is by far my favorite I
got a sample of a hair mask in I
I don't know where I got it from there's
a sample and I've recently been forcing
myself to try all these samples I think
it's a really good way of finding new
products so it was quite decent salvo I
could use it twice and it's the form of
the brand fito specific I think fito or
fighter down they say there's like two
sub brands it's a French brand of pretty
sure and if this is the intense
nutrition mask with plan tomorrow and
you basically apply this after your
shampoo and leave on for 20 minutes and
then wash out and then that's your
condition I've done its bit annoying if
you're having a shower I kind of have to
like put it in my hair and then wrap my
turn around me what ideas sit on the
toilet not on the toilet like the trip
closed and watch youtube videos 20
minutes and then get back in the shower
but it's quite nice if you've got time
to spare but any other the mask so this
has literally changed my hair apparently
the lady itself just told me when I
bought this that the brand was
originally made for afro-caribbean hair
really dry damaged hair which although
mine's not afro-caribbean hair it's very
curly and dry very damaged I used sample
of this and I'm not joking my head like
the best hair week I've ever had and it
was amazing nice delicious restaurants
about this I think was like 20 pounds I
didn't realize it came in a pump but I
like that um n is amazing if you have
dry damaged hair just get this i'm i've
been using a kind of once a week for the
past few weeks and it's amazing it's my
hair feels so soft it's so much easier
to manage i still love my own Jean
products i use the erosional shampoo and
then this and then other days I don't
use this I use ocean on shampoo and
conditioner um but yeah this amazing
that it says will naturally curly
textured hair that's me and I'm just
really I love finding hair products that
work for me because I've got such
difficult hair I get really excited or I
find something so i love this and i'll
definitely be repurchasing this
repurchasing this when i run out i might
like to see if i can buy it when my
Paris gets France or something it's
probably cheaper though yeah so that's
everything thank you for watching and I
hope you enjoyed seeing everything that
I bought I'll see you in my next video
