I am in the airport it's super early
it's like 6 o'clock now but I was off at
half for this morning which is just so
early for me but I am off to Amsterdam
for the day yes you heard right for the
day and if you have ever flown somewhere
and back in one day but lucky I've been
to Amsterdam quite a few times before so
I feel like I've seen it but I'm really
excited because this vlog and my next
vlog that's coming on Tuesday are both
in collaboration with Weller
professional this weekend coming I am
going to Paris Fashion Week with them
I'm going to be vlogging the whole thing
but before I go they asked me if I
wanted to experience their new hair
color technique which is called at night
I am so up for it the technique is like
a huge trend for spring/summer 16 and
it's all about adding light and shade
throughout the hair and it gives you
this like multi tonal look to your hair
they've shown me images and it looks
absolutely beautiful so I'm going to
Amsterdam to meet Hester and her team I
think that you pronounce her name Hester
I'm sure she will correct me if that's
wrong and she helps kind of create this
hair technique so she's gonna be doing
it on me today I can't wait so what my
hair does get a little bit flat
sometimes because of the color so I'm
hoping the whole multi-tonal look
already add some like depth to my hair
and I'm gonna have a consultation with
her tell her like what I'm hoping
forward I'm excited to see what she's
going to create each I'm bringing you
guys with me to Amsterdam today and I'm
really excited to having me to answer in
quite a while
we're gonna be in the salon for a long
time today I'm gonna be filming these
variants but then I think you've got
some free time in afternoon so I tweeted
and you guys sent me some good
recommendations so I'm going
hunting down their shops
we've arrived in Amsterdam right with a
little bit of hampi and i sat by myself
but I survived all good we're gonna get
a cab having the airport and head over
to the Sun or a meeting Hester and I'm
going to try to her about my hair and
then I think we're going to be there for
quite a few hours but I'm really looking
forward to it
I'm really rather than doing the mellow
yellow'
I'm in the salon now and we're actually
just looking at this to like talk about
what colors I'm gonna have in my hair
okay so so it's so pristine so which one
do you think will work for me but I love
that I think there will be a little too
extreme food so I reckon we have to do
something like this in the middle
because you're going to get married yeah
so we don't want you to run away we
still want to give you here and be
really satisfied it's a premium color
and it's a Quaker College so totally
different because we only highlight
highlight seen their hair so it's more
like some kids hair but it's movable
yeah and it's not that extreme but it's
really natural and you know we go how it
fits your face so if it's more nicer
around cheekbone you lighting up there
it's nice just underneath so to get very
like catered isn't it yes which I like
if you want to get this done in a salon
it's called could sure color that's
right we're just heading over now need
to sit down we're gonna talk through a
bit more we're gonna do with my hair
this salon by the way it's a beautiful
my supposed to work and I love the
lipstick it was like trees everywhere
it's so Christine she's work
so this is a limb she's gonna be doing
my color or helping with no I'm asked if
she could just talk through for you guys
what's actually happening because I'll
probably explain it wrong we just talked
about it we need to cover up few gray
hair
Feb 7 2015 1 yeah and then we're gonna
work with the base that we already have
in here's it's lighter and some parts
and we're going to use some horizontal
lines and make them a little bit lighter
to enhance this perfect picture it's a
technique so this is what my hair looks
like before so you guys now I've got a
few kind of light to bits in there
already but it's pretty kind of flat
here so they definitely added like these
horizontal lines which one difficult to
see and how that works so I'm gonna give
it a little bit of a trim as well
the MVP before photo on snapchat now so
thank you okay I've had my consultation
we've talked about colors and just kind
of getting rid of my Gray's lightining
their ends and putting in some like
horizontal highlights I think I might be
here for a while but it's very
comfortable and beautiful in here so I'm
happy
so just on a very little trim because
I'm trying to grow my hair I think now
we're gonna just rip some hair colors
right
so if you wanted to do this yes okay so
for your base color it is discuss before
I think it's nice to keep it a bit
natural so you will see any wrinkles I
just want to cover up some gray hairs
here so I'm just thinking of natural
color tone now my hair always goes
really warm I always have to let use
purple shampoo to keep the frosty turns
away
I like I'm thinking to use turns like
this yeah I realize I'm a dog it's kind
of like a little bit gray which I
couldn't smoke I'm trying to mix it with
the natural tone because I don't want to
make you rue it's great yeah and I do
want to keep it natural and not to water
yeah that's nice all right I like it
when you walk outside in the sun is
shining and then your boots yeah I know
red yeah
so it's done first color which is on the
roots all the way around comes up to the
bottoms make it nice and light natural
brown or build nice and shiny looking
get rid of migraine and then she's gonna
go mix up the second shades now to some
of the other tones it was nice and like
cooling and refreshing yes I prefer to
do it because it makes the rose on the
line a bit more self so she's put in
some of the horizontal stripes which
obviously won't tell anything it's oh my
god my hair is getting bigger and bigger
and if lunch has arrived so I'm gonna go
get some food and I'm just looking good
great right now
this is the name of the place wait this
is the guy thanks for the food and it's
from here if anyone's interested it's
very yummy and healthy okay it's time to
rinse off the color great angle she's
just applying the toner to kind of keep
it she toned because I don't go to warm
and now she's gonna go on a treatment
because you guys never hairs just like
crazy so that's gonna chill her out of
it
here my treatments been washed out and
now gonna blow dry it and see what it
looks like I've really excited I kind of
Debbie know what to expect they know it
put in a couple of horizontal lines
which sounds really interesting but I'm
excited to see what its gonna look like
when it's all float rise so these are
all the I need product and this is
actually one guys Paris Fashion Week or
they're gonna be using all of these
backstage so things given me this is
gonna be easy so me today yes yeah
so they have finished the blow-dry I'm
just having a photo taken behind me I'm
not gonna move I really like it and
we're gonna put some waves in but I just
want to show you guys while it's
straight you can see the color so it's
like a nice brown up here and then you
can see they're kind of horizontal
stripes but it's so subtle and pretty
just like an enhanced version of my own
hair color I really really like it
thanks guys
they're pretty okay so these are the two
products that has to recommend I use the
thermal protection spray thermal image
which is a good heat protector and the
sugar lips which I love is like instead
of salt it's sugar
and that will like give me a bit of lift
in my roots okay leaving the salon oh my
god my makeup has just disappeared I put
it on at like 5:00 this morning and I
didn't bring any with me to top up so I
just looked so pale so we're gonna go
try it
I'm gonna go try and find a shop called
Anna and Nina which loads of you guys
tweeted me saying that we have to go
I actually have no idea what kind of
shop it is clothes history food no idea
but I trust it so we're gonna walk in
the rain to fire into Anna and Nina time
to get your hair done definitely already
curly it is so cold and rainy in
Amsterdam
we're desperate or not really like shop
housing whether I'm not gonna lie
there are so many nice things in this
shop but I am strangely attracted to
this pineapple pin and I really want it
just an update on the weather it is hey
Leland Cheung supervising like seriously
chunks of ice we're now in a shop called
Alice home of brands and it's beautiful
let me show you trying on these
beautiful shoes because I have those
Topshop culottes and I just don't want

cool I'm just wondering I know I'd wear
them to Paris Fashion Week but would I
wear them again okay I kind of love them
but you can't really see I mean like
this day you can remove these yeah okay
okay I think I'm gonna get those shoes
and I'm also gonna get these rings cuz I

descending but I was vlogging the whole
way and he started like going down and

like accelerating and not and I felt
like someone who wasn't a pilot was
driving and I was so I was like sniffing
my smelling stuff and like freaking out
of it so didn't love but I'm home now
feeling happy to be home and feel like
