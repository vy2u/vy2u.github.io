spree type video I'm going to be showing
you two things that I bought over the
last few weeks the office where I work
have recently moved back to the centre
of London so I'm near all the shops
which is really bad for my bank balance
I keep going out on my lunch break and
buying things but I've put myself in a
band now but I thought I'd show you the
things I've sort of got over the last
few weeks a lot of its makeup specially
lips for some reason I'm really into
lipstick at the moment so I thought show
you everything that I've got and I
better get started because there's quite
a lot so the first thing is this soap &amp;amp;
Glory lip balm I got this from boots
it's called a great kisser
lip moisturizing balm and this is in
juicy peach so it looks like that and
literally stars amazing it smells like
the peach sweets you get that sweet
shops which my favorites I really love
this so it's really nice it's like um
quite clear but with slightly don't know
if you're gonna have to see that it's
quite glossy it smells amazing it's not
sticky it's really nice so I've just
been keeping that in my bag as my lip
balm for the moment the next thing sorry
I'm keeping it all keeping them all in
this little box here so I'm just gonna
grab them out the next thing is a
natural collection eyeshadow which is
this one and that's in the color secret
Lagoon which looks like that so it's
really nice the aqua blue green this is
really nice I've been wearing this with
my mac eyeliner in minted I still put
the eyeliner on first and then add this
too as well and it's really nice mix so
it sort of looks like that and I also
really like the pot it's really small so
it doesn't take up too much space and I
really like you and now is really cheap
I'll put all the information for
products I mentioned in the description
bar below but yeah these were both sort
of quite cheap the next thing was a bit
of a random splurge
a fan of tip teak I've got two perfumes
from there and a candle I think just one
so I won't see another candle but the
big ones are quite expensive so I
thought I'd go for a single one because
they're around 20 pounds I think I'm
just too expensive but I love them
they're my favourite candles so I got
this one which I don't really know how
to pronounce things faith I'm not really
sure but it basically means berries this
smells like roses and blackberries it's
amazing I think this is my new favorite
scent from the batik I've really loved
it and it's a cute little mini candle
but it will last a while I know well I
haven't have any burns at once these you
can see I'm trying I'm saving it that's
really nice I really like that the next
thing I got was a 17 lipstick this is in
Beehive I've heard quite a lot about
this on other people's blogs so I
thought I'd buy it and give it a try and
it looks quite nice it's sort of that's
the sort of colour so I thought it'd be
quite nice like everyday natural I
really don't like this I'll show you
what it looks like on it's quite
moisturizing like when you try it in
your hand it's quite glossy you see
there but it just doesn't it's just it
feels really cheap when you put on your
lips it's quite like patchy and I just
haven't gotten with it at all
I'm just ashamed because I thought Oh
everyone's talking about it and it's
cheap so it must be amazing but I'm
really disappointed
that's 17 beehives that's the only thing
I bought that I regret buying next thing
is over the last few weeks I've got
three new MAC lipsticks which is just
ridiculous I'm not buying any more matte
lipsticks for a while now definitely and
the first one I would have run a line
with an early coat and this is them the
new FIFA Glam lipstick and Nicki
this is Nicki Minaj's lipstick and
that's a sort of pink slightly coral but
very soft bubblegum pink and I've done a
blog post on this so I
below I'm not sure how much use I'm
going to get out of that but it's nice
to have and the other one that's also in
the same blog post is watch me simmer
just from the new mac cook mac shop mac
whatever it's called collection and this
is a really nice coral color like this I
wear this like quite light on my lips
and I'll show you I'll show you what the
Nikki one looks like as well so that's
watch me simmer that's that's Nikki see
it's a lot more pink than less orange
then watch me simmer and then the other
one I got is angel I really wanted like
an everyday lipstick
and that's really easy to just wear I
can wear to work and this is actually
the one I'm wearing now it looks like
this
it's really nice that's quite worried
because this is a frost finish and I've
just heard really bad things about frost
lipsticks it sounds a bit like but I
tried it on I really like it I don't
know why what people don't like frost
but I'll show you what that looks like
so that's the top one they're really
nice easy pink Center really like this
happens every day it's really the best
lipstick I've ever bought I can get the
most use out of need stop buying bright
lipsticks that I can't wear the next
thing is probably the biggest waste of
money I've ever spent
it's this new lipstick lip balm from
Topshop now you'll see why I bought this
this is called crystal and it's
something like 9 pound 50 which is why
I'm annoyed I bought it and it's been
really nice to packaging not the friends
ringing it's in really nice packaging
it's like quite a big fat tube and look
at this it's amazing when you look at
the actual lipstick I don't know if you
can really see but it's basically like
clear with loads of sparkles Chris
it looks amazing and this is one of
those lip balms it's or adjusts the
temperature of your lips or something
like that so you put it on it kind of is
clear and then it changes color so I'll
show you on my hand I don't know if
you'll be able to see
you kind of see it's gone a bit pink I
don't know it's I think it's a bit
gimmick really it does get quite a nice
pink on my lips but it's not worth 9.50
at all I just think that's overpriced
for glorified lip balm so that's these
two of the regrets from the pile while
stars in Topshop though I also got
another lip product and this one I
really like
it's the lipstick sort of lip pencil in
powder room and when I saw this I
thought it really reminds me of the NARS
lip pencils and Kate's for gross parties
has one of those and it looks amazing
but this I thought I'm gonna have to
give it a go and see if it's a good
alternative so I'll draw it on here for
you so it looks like that it's a pretty
pink it's quite matte but it's also
creamy so when you put it on it's really
easy to put on and you can sort of rub
it in with your fingers and blend it out
it can be quite drying so I'd put a lip
balm on first but it's not it's not too
bad that you can't wear it I do really
like it it's very pink girly color so I
wouldn't wear it every day but I think
that's quite good by do recommend me in
there they're nice and there's a few
different colors of things the next
thing is an eye shadow from Bobbi Brown
I've never bought I showed us from Bobbi
Brown before I get my concealer and
corrector from there I've had gel
eyeliner I've had quite a few different
things I've never really thought about
getting the eyeshadows before and I
watching a video one of missglamorazzi
is video and she was talking about this
and I just made me want to buy it so I
did it's rose gold and so it looks like
this really like the packaging actually
so it's literally as it says quite a
pinky that's probably the wrong things
pinky golden shade and it's really nice
it is quite pink compared to that
eyeshadows that I normally wear
but I think I mind it now actually Adam
if you can see I do really like it so
I'm really happy with that it's really
creamy texture really easy to like blend
really nice actually so I probably get
more flavor and shallots in the future
now I know how big they are and they're
it's really sweet little packaging so
what two more things the next thing is
quite boring
it's a Mac eyeliner just in black I
needed an another black eyeliner I've
been trying a few different sort of
cheaper ones but they all I just hate it
like I don't know what I always use it
they're like the inside at the top and
if it doesn't go on straight away I get
really frustrated and I don't want to be
like scraping my eye so I need one that
it's really black and goes on one swipe
I'd like it to stay on preferably but
even if it doesn't stay all day
I think applying is the most important
for me so I got Mac feline and I used to
have smolder so I just thought I'd try
feeling because it's the other good
black one and I absolutely love it you
hardly even have to like to touch in its
black right so I love it you just one
side black done easy I've really really
recommend this it's big it's gonna last
me a long time the final thing I was
definitely a complete random splurge I'd
read Kate from Ghost parties again just
obviously my enabler I read her blog
post about the NARS highlighter and are
not big highlighter person I've used a
few cream highlighters I've got Gemma
kid one I always feel like it's just an
extra step I can't really be bothered to
do but this one looks really nice and
they look more like of a blusher
highlighter so it's good miss Liberty
from NARS and and I wear this underneath
my blusher I'm not wearing it today I
went up a dog first and then put my
blusher on top I was quite worried at
first because it looks quite sparkly but
it actually doesn't go on that sparkly
and it has a nice peachy tone to it so
it's really flattering on my skin tone
and I just really like it
I love NARS packaging
I'll say that always squeeze me if you
can see it it's really subtle some
highlighters are a bit like extreme but
just gives a really nice little glisten
it makes you bit regrowing and fresh and
healthy so I really like that and I'm
happy I got that even though it's
probably quite expensive but I think the
last my NARS blushes last week ages so
this will as well so that's everything I
hope you like seeing everything that I
fought and let me know if you've tried
any of these or what you think of them
and please subscribe I'm hopefully going
to be making some more videos soon and
thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
