today and I'm not sure why but I thought
I would just bring the camera along with
me I'm not really doing anything that
interesting but I haven't blogged in a
little while I know you guys like them
so I'm going to be vlogging today and
I've just woken up I haven't done my
makeup yet I've just strengthened my
hair I just starts at the morning
laughing a lot because rich told me that
he had a two-part dream so the other
night he dreamt that he was working at
Krispy Kreme and then last night the
dream continued and he said I still
hadn't Bridge what did you say he still
hadn't got your your t-shirt he still
hadn't got his t-shirt ha it was his
second shift at Krispy Kreme he said I
still had my t-shirt the manager was
still an asshole
it just made me laugh so much that he's
like continued on the stream about
working at Krispy Cooper I'm going to
use the new NARS Velvet Matte skin tint
today I've been using this for a while
just feel like this month really and I
really quite liked it but today I know
I'm going to be outdoors so I want to
wear it properly look at it in the
mirror when I'm out in the sunshine I
use two shades Finland would work me
that's the lightest shade I can't
believe on the lighter shade and then
this one is Alaska which is shade 2 and
sometimes I like to mix them but this
one is probably my best bet and I like
to use my wet sponge Real Techniques
sponge with it as well which I think
works really nicely it's not like matte
matte I'll show you it kind of looks
quite a luminous on the skin actually
for a matte foundation first thing I'm
doing this morning is I'm going to
Google for a couple of meetings and I'm
so excited because it's very hard to
explain but because I kind of work for
myself my only boss if I were to have a
boss would be Google and Google owns
YouTube by the way in case you don't
know because if YouTube were suddenly to
change something dramatically that would
really affect my job because what I do
is upload videos on YouTube and it's
such a weird feeling not having any
contact with YouTube not knowing any big
changes they're going to make so having
any kind of contact there is so
important for me and I'm going to go
meet with the engineering team I can ask
them all these like geeky techie
questions that I have and then I'm
meeting with a guy who says he's like my
channel manager but I don't know that
means because I've never met before but
I think it's probably going to advise me
on like times I should upload my videos
and
I don't know take whatever advice I want
and not take it I know that they're
going to talk a lot about thumbnails and
titles of videos but I personally don't
really like to do clickbait I like to
encourage people to watch my videos but
I don't want to kind of lie in the title
to make people watch it I'm quite
against that so I'm going to go and have
a chat see what advice they can give me
see what I can learn always up for
trying new things and improving my
channel and just meeting new people
really Google's got a really cool office
so fun to go in there anyway so I'm just
packing up my bag I've got quite a lot
of stuff to take with I'm going to take
my laptop with and then my notebook
which I'm still loving by the way my
bullet journal and this is just like a
notebook to write scruffy notes in that
don't look nice I do think they're all
going to fit in this tray three bags so
I'm going to take my Chloe bag which I
haven't worn in a little while I
absolutely love it I'm always worried
about filling it too much though I don't
like break the handles but I think it'll
be right I always stuff my bags just to
keep the shape apparently it's going to
be sunny today so I'm going to make use
of my glasses
oops I think I'm going to take these
ray-ban Wayfarers actually this shape
suits me so much better than the
Wayfarers these are the Erica's and they
really suit my face but I'm so annoyed
because I only have them in brown and
sometimes I just want like black color
they do like black ones with a blue
glass and I really like those I can't
buy anymore sunglasses I just have too
many but I really want these in black
I'm going to wear these today I'm just
annoyed that they're Brown I've changed
your mind
this turned in some kind of like
sunglass collection video I'm gonna wear
these these are my deal ones ok little
outfit of the day wait let me start
again why don't we start with ok it's
such a bad habit here's an outfit for
today this is my bomber from Topshop
it's a little bit big on the arms I'm
always in between a 10 and a 12 and
everything and it's very frustrating but
I feel like with a bomber it's better to
go slightly bigger especially because
it's quite short I love it I just can't
believe in wearing bombers again anyway
I feel like I definitely ruining an
upcoming haul video here but whatever
t-shirts or Urban Outfitters they've got
loads of added a stuff in at the moment
and I really like it very comfortable I
do love a good teacher my black Jamie
jeans my Stan Smith trainers I've had
for a while now what else my Chloe bag
does that go not really don't really
care I think I'm gonna get the tube to
Covent Garden I'm going to be a bit
early and I want to have a little walk
through Covent Garden I haven't been
there in so long I'm in Covent Garden
it's 9:30 and everything's closed but I
guess that's probably good for my purse
but once I have a bit of a brow so I'm
just going to walk over to Google now
and everyone's looking at me again I
haven't blogged in public for a while
you ever see this huge giant orange
building in Covent Garden that is the
Google offices and the YouTube office
and everything Google related so I'm
going to head in there
I just left the Google offices I was the
last role in their resume last film it
was really interesting I had a meeting
with the engineering team to come out
like new changes and developments it's
got coming up on the platform and then I
met with someone who can like help me
with my channel and developing my
channel and how I do things and it was
so interesting I loved learning about
that kind of thing I feel like I would
really enjoy working at Google but am I
going I was mentoring me to my friend
Jen for lunch but she got slapped
highest it just has to cancel which is a
shame so we're going to go meet Lucy
instead and I think she's getting her
eyebrows done at Liberty we're going to
go eat somewhere really really inspired
and happy and excited again I was really
really down yesterday so this is a good
morning
I went in superdrug to look for
something I found a double pack of the
Real Techniques lunges awesome I need
like pretty much ruins as I try to wash
it so it was that was very exciting so
I'm going to lunch cops while which is
like a Lebanese canteen diner and I
really like it so once again rant nice
bikes I'm gonna go now I'm just waiting
Felicity I am so much but I'm really
like this place and so many places pick
from this area I'll show you why always
go for when I come here even for lunch I
always get a tagine
I love Toshi's and that aubergine tagine
is so delicious and because it's got any
meat or anything in it it's not too
filling this part and it's so yummy
they've got loads of cool like wraps and
stuff here yummy lunch I'm really full
now and I'm going to quickly pop into we
built this city cuz I'm on Carnaby
Street and I love it
favourite shop for prints so I'm going
to grab a look see what they've got at
the moment in here and just in the
Liberty beauty Hall and I love the law
section in the backside the blinker
albarn that careful
productor Sarah - they have Pixy glow
tonic look how many they have things pop
that's amazing do I deal of it in
Liberty I know I say all the time it's
so nice in there I'm think I'm going to
head to the game office now because I
need to do a bit of work and it's like
got to late to go home and film so I
might as well just put my laptop with
doing the check my emails and then catch
homeless
I'm just leaving the game or face ended
up staying there pretty much all
afternoon working it's quite late now
it's like six o'clock I'm gonna head to

so I will speak to you guys later
I'm finished blogging yesterday
I'm now home as I said I wait to my
parents we did some wedding duties and
we have both my sister's there and it
was actually really good and productive
and made me feel less stressed one thing
picked off our list which is there
behind me good evening good evening I'm
I was gonna show you something I hardly
remember but I'm a luckily luckiest I am
the luckiest girl in the world
I have so many flowers in my flat right
now let me show you lovely girls and
space in case sent me this terrain iam
pretty sure it's called a geranium I am
obsessed with it I literally have been
wanting to make one of these for so long
and I was a bit overwhelmed and not sure
how still want to learn but for now I've
got this one and I app see love it I've
put that there these flowers were sent
to me from the lovely ladies at Clarins
they're so so so pretty and then these
over here it was sent to me from a
production company that I'm working with
on a shoot I just shoot with in the
other day and they're absolutely
gorgeous this doesn't even look real
that rich I was going to save this to a
Sunday but then I felt really bad for
lying what what is it
Selfridges sent me something to give
rich as a Valentine's present and I was
like I can't pretend that I bought this
I just didn't
Selfridges bought it for you via me so
can I give it to you now yeah so I won't
be vlogging on Sunday on Sunday me rich

James are all going boxing so romantic
Valentine's Day see you not that I open

realize it's not like a man but look
what it says on it love Lily look they
like drawn on it a man painting a heart

Selfridges I made especially for you I
thought the idea and everything okay it

my Valentines thing this year so
romantic of me can't really remember

maybe just a bit throughout the day but
for now I think I'm going to sign off
because I want watch Hollyoaks and I've
got to do some emails as well so see you
guys tomorrow
so those of you that have seen my
organizational video you know that I
talk a lot about my flawed robe but the
second thing that I also do when I'm
trying to convince rich that I don't
have a flawed robe as I create a bed
robe which is kind of like a flawed robe
on a bed that's the second step before
it makes its way into the drawers I
think today I'm going to wear this Urban
Decay Gwen Stefani lipstick which is in
ex-girlfriend I don't know if I got like
a sample packaging or if this is the
final packaging it is I think it's a
little bit flimsy I don't love it and
want to spit plasticky and like doesn't
really turn up properly I like I had to
turn it three times before oh no it's
actually broken I feel like it's really
cheap packaging maybe I got the
compressed sample oh no it's broken oh
this is a nice angle I got it to work I
use my other hand yeah cheapy packaging
let me show you what it looks like on
ex-girlfriend this one is which is like
a nice nude nice and creamy that's quite
pretty I've been wearing my Lillian
liner scarf for so long that I forgot
about this blue Topshop one night
absolutely love and it's definitely
still cold drunk from the UK to wear a
scarf it's quite nice and like sunny and
fresh at the moment I feel like normally
it snows this time of year well I got
one of those alerts on Facebook saying
this day four years ago it was snowing
but it's not snowing it's not raining
it's nice and bright and fresh but just
freezing cold
so definitely scarf weather marine it
with my whistles coat and ripped Topshop
jeans and trainers and me and rich are
now going out to do yet another wedding
meeting very wedding fight at the moment
because rich is kind of changing jobs so
he won't have much spare time soon so
we're going to go do that and then we
are going to go pick up on you glasses I
will explain what I'm talking about then
rich has a snack for me cuz I haven't
had breakfast my kids snack so so did
not realise these were for kids
we're gonna go to caffeine really good
place for coffee okay reading coffee
meeting whatever it was done me and
Richard are gonna head to Spitalfields
because we both need to pick up our new
glasses we last week or a couple of
weeks ago we went to have our eyes test
a shop could Bailey Nelson I'll explain
more when I get there but the glass is
already cracking up oh I'm going to go
head there now normally in the past I've
got my glasses on perspective as a
visual express because that's where I
get my eye test done and I've got Tom
Ford glasses I find in those other
places you end up wine designer glasses
not because you really want them just
because they're the only ones to suit
you can they have all these different
designer glasses and you know you're not
spending like see my glasses were like
150 pounds last time the reason I really
like Bailey Nelson is Pakula bear glass
it's pretty much all of their glasses
and 98 pounds for the glass that after
the eye test for the brain as well I
think a guy just included it mostly last
film frames but still only affordable
classes and they're all really cool like
trendy style
not like random friends random stone
they're like crazy shapes and they're
really nice I'll show you the ones I
bought their like pipe round they're
like I'm breathing and lighter in the
bottoms and I'm really excited to have
them with the lenses and so rich got
some as well and it's just a really cool
store the girl who did our eye test
betadine we went to the Spitalfields
bronze she was just really young and
cool and the whole experience is really
nice so I would definitely recommend
them all excited to get your new glasses
here's the store so this is the spitter
first one is a really cool one at common
garden there as well how cool it is look
always 98 pounds this is the glasses
shape that I went for they're the new
style and I guess like you liked another
box at all
great show me seal Oh
so I'm really happy with them looking
forward to wearing this kind of quickly
pop into cause because so quiet run good
time to have a look and then I need to
get hurt in film video there's a place
here called Maki it says design your own
sushi so we're gonna see what that's all
about maybe gets like take home for
lunch we didn't go for it in the end
didn't look fresh and very classy of a
sushi
what should we do which fancy I'm home
I'm wearing my glasses I'm lying on the
bed
