skincare series and this is the last one
I really hope you've enjoyed the last
two videos I put my morning skincare
routine up on Monday so I'll link that
here and then on Thursday I put my
evening skincare routine so I really
hoped you liked both those videos this
one is going to be about my favorite
masks and treatments and oils and all
those kind of things so I hope you enjoy
it so I've just put together a selection
of some of my favorite masks and oils to
show you the ESOP parsley seed mask is
one of my all-time favorites might use
it all year round from the matter what
my skin is doing it's a clay-based mask
but it's much thinner than others that
I've tried so I just apply it all over
my skin and it feels really refreshing I
find this particularly good when I've
got any redness or pesky spots you leave
it to dry for 15 minutes as you can see
it gets this funny pattern and you know
it's dry when it hardens up and you
can't really move your face like this
I then remove it with a dap muslin cloth
and it's much easier to remove the some
of the thicker mud mask so it doesn't
drag the skin a good moisture mask is
the evader intensive hydrating mask this
is kind of as Caroline says a souped up
version of the Hydra Leone serum
it's intense moisture and you can either
leave it on for 10 minutes and then wipe
off with a damp cloth which is what I've
done here or you can just leave it to
soak into the skin it's really good if
like me you have dehydrated skin it just
inject some oyster back into the skin
I've recently also been trying the super
facialist but Yoona Brannon miracle
makeover facial oil and this is a pre
cleansing oil and it's really nice but
I'm also obsessed with the Sarah Chapman
overnight facial this is an oil that I
use sort of every other night or every
third night instead of my evening
moisturizer it's a really intensive oil
and it makes your skin feel incredible I
cannot even explain I wake up the next
morning with glowing skin and this has
really become a Holy Grail product for
me it's just a beautiful overnight oil
one I've raved about a lot is the
origins drink up intensive overnight
mask it's a really good mask if you have
dehydrated skin it smells incredible it
smells like apricots and peaches and you
just apply a thin layer all over your
face before you go to bed and leave it
to soak in overnight when you wake up in
the morning there'll be no product left
your skin will just drink it all up and
it feels really great in the morning
so that's it that's all my three
skincare videos done I really hope
you've enjoyed my little skincare series
this week and seen what I do in my
routine and the products I like to use
let me know your favorite skincare
products are I always like being
recommended new stuff so much for
watching and I'll see you back on my
normal upload day next Thursday bye hi
so this is the second video in my
skincare series if you haven't seen the
first one I'll link it here and it was
my morning skincare routine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
