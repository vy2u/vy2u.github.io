probably won't be morning when i upload
this but i'm just going to do a video
today on sort of some skin care products
that I've been trying recently just to
give you a background on my skin type
I've got normal to dry skin I don't
really get spots ever I'm quite lucky um
but I do get dry skin sometimes but it's
pretty normal I don't need to use half
the skin care products I use but i just
love trying skincare and i love the
whole skin care routine and um yeah so i
just want to keep trying new products
which is probably not very good but i
like to do it so today I'm just going to
talk to you about these bits I've sort
of been trying for you different things
and I just wanted to bug them all in one
video really so um I'm going to start
with these and these all this I've just
got two samples it's the sure mirror the
new cleansing oil it's called ultamate
like Alton 80 just quite funny it like
texting language um and this is one of
their new cleansing oils they've got
loads of different all they've got loads
of different oils and I've only tried
the green one I think I don't know why
I've just never really got into oils I
didn't I wouldn't like the thought of
taking my makeup off with the oil but i
got these samples and i gave gave them a
try and i really like it actually you
sort of put the oil line and as soon as
you put water with it it sort of turns
bit foamy a bit milky and take every bit
of makeup off this is the only thing
makes two mile is l cleanse &amp;amp; polish
that really takes off or my makeup well
apart from a bioderma but that's not
really like a cleanser um so i really
like this i'm going to keep using it
because it's an oil you do sort of feel
more like moisturised afterwards you
don't you never have that sort of like
dry like tight face feeling so um it's
really nice and I'd recommend trying it
this is the newest one that's supposed
to be the best it's got like everything
that all the others have in one so yeah
they having big bottles with palms as
well so I'm going to finish those
samples and then see if I want to buy
the full size I've be really interested
in rennes skin
recently mainly due to kates from ghost
parties she's always going on about how
much she loves it so I wanted to try
something I went up to the sort of
counter and selfridges they have like a
little section with it and I was going
to sort of go and buy a product but the
products are quite big and I didn't
really want to buy it and then I might
hate it so I asked if they had any
samples they don't have samples as such
but they do these really good little
kits they're like this and this one's
the one for normal skin and and I got
this one because it's got the mask in it
that I really wanted to try so I thought
was worth it i think this is about 12
pounds of something which is really good
i think for for products i'll show you
what you get inside so it's cute box men
inside there's like four tubes and you
get a rose cleansing gel the lady at the
counter was desperately trying to sell
this to me she says perfect for my skin
type but I've really look I'm not really
a rose fan um Missy yeah I really don't
write smell it minds you of like you
know there's fake flowers you get the
they're like dried up flowers that's
what smells like to me I quite like the
gel texture of the cleanser it was quite
it's quite good but I wouldn't
repurchase this and maybe because of the
smell I had that with most of rent
products you'll see smells really
important for me was getting care and I
probably shouldn't be I don't mind it
does about anything just if it does have
a fragrance I have to like it the other
product was the vitamineral day cream
and this is nice let me just refresh my
memory it's nice it's quite like a thin
cream which I quite like in a day
moisturizer mmm smells all right I don't
know smells a bit funny to me I wouldn't
repurchase it but I will use this one up
and because quite nice the next thing in
the kit is the frankincense revitalizing
night cream now I like the texture night
creams
bit thicker but I really really dislike
smell it smells really peppery it's
fully supposed to smile at frankincense
but to me it's not like pepper and I
hate pepper so I don't like that smell
oh I probably give this to rich to use
because quite manly smell as well and
then the final thing with the reason why
I bought the kit is the glycol actic
even if i said that right and radiance
renewal mask which is this which is a
lot of bloggers are talking about this
mask at the moment and i really wanted
to try it so it goes on sorts of an
orange gel and it's very sticky and
again i really don't like the smell it
sort of tastes smells like orange but
really really bitter orange um so i put
this all over and then I wiped it off
and I feel like I couldn't wait to get
the stickiness off my face that well and
it didn't Wow me I wasn't like oh my god
my skin's it feels amazing after this so
I was bit disappointed because I thought
I would absolutely love this and i'm
glad i got the sample before buying
full-size flaws about to buy it and so I
wouldn't be purchased this because it's
not the best mask of this type that I've
tried but i will use it up um yeah so
i'd recommend getting one of these kits
if you want to try rent and we don't
really know if you're gonna like it or
not there's one for normal skin oily
skin combination skin a little different
light set and I think they're around
like 12 pounds so that's really good i'm
glad i got that i got from Selfridges
and the next thing is this I think you
say it I used to say it wrong I think
it's Antipodes I used to say like
Antipodes are these antibodies and it's
the reincarnation pure facial exfoliator
I went to a twenty percent off its
massive pharmacy in London really famous
old pharmacy and they had twenty percent
of everything so I went with a friend
and and I was just I didn't even know
what I think i was first looked this
because it's the same sort of packaging
as a sup I think that's how you say um
so I was like oh let me try it i've
tried the cleanser I didn't love that I
tried the gel Juliet's cleanser and I
didn't love it at all so I wasn't really
interested in the
round but i thought i'd try this on the
back of my hands i put someone rubbed in
and the white of and I can't even
explain to you my hand felt so soft and
when I compared it to my other hand it
was like so fresh and clean looking and
I was completely so like there wasn't
even a saleslady that I just did it
myself but I was like I'm definitely
getting this exfoliator I can't remember
how much it was it pop I think it was
quite expensive like maybe 18 pounds or
something so this is what it looks like
it was quite good because it means you
can get all the products out and use it
all up it's a really natural exfoliator
sis got one hundred percent pure avocado
oil marigold flower tonka bean and
sandalwood and i have to always comment
on the smell I don't love the smell it
sounds a bit like explain it like
cardboard I don't know if cardboard has
a smell but it's not particularly nice
smell it's not horrible but it's just
amazing it's like a white you kind of
see a white creamy texture and it's not
what I was really harsh that's radiators
when you rub it in you can sort of feel
this little beads it's not really harsh
but then when you wipe off my skin just
feels so soft it's amazing I think it's
probably one of the best exfoliate as
I've ever tried so I really recommend
going to try this if you like a good
exfoliator to try on the back of a hand
first and I'm sure you'll be impressed
like I was so I'm very happy with that
the next is a product i already know i'm
not going to recommend and not because
of the quality of the product because of
the price i actually got a space NK
event um i was very lucky to receive it
I wouldn't buy it myself it's called
zelans i think i say you say it by dr.
marko lens and it's the 3t complex um
the reason i won't recommend this is
because it's 95 pounds i think which is
just crazy for australia i would never
spend that much and but it's not
targeted at me it's targeted at older
ladies so maybe they would and it comes
in a really nice like glass jar and it's
basically an anti-aging moisturizing
cream it does say it's preventative so
it is quite good to use it when you
because it prevents signs of aging like
once you have them this is something
that always really annoys me like when
young girls they think anti-aging
products aren't for them they think this
for older older women but most of them
once you get signs of aging you can't
reverse it so it's actually better to
use it when you're younger to prevent
the signs of aging hearing anyway that's
my little route of the day so this one
looks like it's a pot smells really nice
it's really fresh and sort of green it
smells like trees and also a little bit
sweet a little bit like honey as well
I'm not actually sure of the ingredients
in it um but it's really nice it's quite
thick I where I put it on at night it's
quite thick it really spreads really
easily over the face and just really
moisturizes it's really lovely one of
the nicest moisturizers I've tried and I
would love to repurchase it but there's
no way I couldn't spend ninety five
pounds and I moisturize and I'm afraid
maybe one day I'll be able to afford
95,000 moisturizer but at the moment
there's absolutely no need so I'm using
this sparingly and I'm enjoying it a lot
the next is a product I've been
interested in for quite a while it's the
LMS papaya enzyme peel and this is the
limited edition packaging to celebrate
10 years of this product which is pretty
cool that they've had this product for
10 years and they've done a
limited-edition packaging and part of
the money when you buy it goes to
charity which is very cool so this is an
enzyme peel which sounds really scary
but it basically just have enzymes in it
that breaks down all the dry skin on
your face and it has extracts from pyar
and pineapples so it's nice and fruity
and then come on for smells fruity oh
yeah it does it smells really fruity a
bit artificial actually but nice like
it's a nice smell yeah I remember when I
put it on I thought the smart was nice
so it goes on sort of white but not pure
white sort of a bit transparent you put
it all over your face and you're
supposed to leave it for 10 to 15
minutes and when you do it sort of
separates a bit there's a funny like
pattern on your face
but it feels really nice doesn't go
tight or anything like a mask and and
then use wash it off and you can tell
your skin's feels really nice and soft
actually gives a similar effect to the
exfoliator so it's kind of like
exfoliating you'd have to rub it and you
just sort of leave it and it just breaks
down um and yeah I really like this I
definitely recommend it and i think when
i finish this and it's quite a lot in
there but i would probably repurchase it
it's something nice that you can do sort
of every other night you shouldn't use
it every day or every like three days
and it makes my skin feel really good so
i'm very pleased with that the next one
is a clinique product my friend actually
gave this to me I think it's a sample
size is the clinic moist this moisture
surge um I've seen it before clinique
counters but I've never picked it up I
don't know why it's probably quite
expensive actually don't know how much
is but it comes in this little pot which
is nice for a sample and it looks like
this sort of a pinky color and I'm not
blown away by this it's a very thin
consistency which is quite nice the
daytime but it doesn't feel like it's
doing much my skin I've got other data
and moisturizers I much prefer so I
wouldn't buy the full size of this and
I'm not really sure I'm even going to
use this up I might give it away because
it just is a bit average for me really
and then the final product is from road
I'll so how you say it I can't pronounce
any of these things sorry I've said that
so many times in this video you know it
looks like this and I actually got this
on the space like a website in the sale
because it gone down from something
crazy like 45 pounds to 15 so I didn't
even want it or need it I just thought
that such a good deal I just have to get
it I'd even know why so it's called the
glam bomb it's actually really hard to
find out much information on this and I
was looking online and it's very
confusing they've got a few different
types of glam bombs and it says it's an
anti-aging skin treatment for face lips
neck and hands and it helps reduce the
appearance of wrinkles and it plumps up
lips and 30 days it's kind of weird it's
like a bomb texture and it plumps up
your lips you can put your elbows
actually put on last night
really helps actually quite dry elbows
and you can put on your face sort of an
overnight master it's a really thick
texture it's sort of when you first
squeeze it out it comes out but all you
leave but then it's quite thick bomb and
I did when I first got as I just seemed
just for your face put whatever faith
was like oh my god is so thick so I'm
not sure how I feel about for not my
face it's all right for sort of
overnight mask but it's really thick and
intense and but it's nice used on your
elbows and on your lips and it's kind of
like redials answer to Elizabeth Arden's
eight hour cream and compared them very
similar this one source files a bit more
like her believe but more oily um I
don't love the eight hour cream I don't
like the scent and it's too greasy for
me but I quite like this I don't think
I'd repurchase it because I don't really
need something for my elbows and lips
and I use a lip balm and a moisturizer
I've got lots of things like that so
it's not something I need in my life but
it was a pretty good deal on the website
so I'm glad I got it and I will use it
so that's everything that's kind of the
skin care products i've been using at
the moment i just want to lay in and my
thoughts on them I'm very nearly at
10,000 subscribers which is so exciting
when i started doing videos I just
remember thinking oh my god if I ever
got to 10,000 subscribers it would be
amazing and I'm actually really near now
and I haven't really done anything to
encourage it apart from just making
videos when I can so I'm really glad you
guys obviously enjoying my videos I'm
enjoying making them and I am going to
be doing a giveaway when i get to 10,000
subscribers just to say thank you to
everybody so keep an eye on that i
probably won't go up as soon as i get
10,000 because my life is just not that
organized but hope you'll go up sort of
around that time so yeah thanks for
watching and see you in my next video
