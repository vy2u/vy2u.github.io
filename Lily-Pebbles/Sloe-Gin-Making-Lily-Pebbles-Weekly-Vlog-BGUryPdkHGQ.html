Tuesday night or tomorrow morning
Wednesday morning so this is part of my
makeup for the day and I'm gonna go and
buy some bread from the local shop
because media is actually coming over
she hasn't seen my new flat yet and I
said come on for some avocado on toast
as you do so I think I'm gonna go buy
some bread cuz I've been learning toasts
for the avocado a media's being here for
a while we've just been chatting away
and she bought some Blondie's which are
delicious which are basically brownies
with white chocolate all right yeah they
really am I've had one and I'm thinking
my favorite I'm having like a healthy
break Emilia's now left and I feel bad
it didn't vlog more but we were just
chatting lasers really nice to catch up
we haven't seen each other properly in a
really long time
so we were just sitting on the sofa and
chatting I'm gonna get ready now and I'm
gonna head into town because I want to
head it into Liberty first to take back
my Sophie home bag I phoned them and
they said even though I don't have a
receipt because I use my Liberty loyalty
card they can look it up and then they
send the bag - Sophie homes get repaired
hopefully so that's good and you did
have good customer service
good old liberty and then I'm going to
meet Anna Caroline and Ruth and recentl
cute baby and we're gonna have tea
together because the Sanderson hotel are
doing this like Mad Hatter's Tea thing
at the moment which sounds amazing so
really looking forward to that
okay I'll quickly show you what I'm
wearing before I head out not very
dressy actually just black jeans these
new Topshop boots that I'm just laughing
at the moments they're so comfortable
and this is a cashmere sweater from M&amp;amp;S
last year I love it I just love that
it's got the blue grey and black it's
like my three favorite colors all in one
and then I'm not really doing anything
with
pair of faced I'm in town and I've got
half an hour to let me to meet the girls
so I'm gonna head to Liberty and quickly
ask them if they can send up the bag too
many liberties custom service was
incredible as usual and now I'm heading
to the sound
the Sanderson hotel is on Berner Street
which fun fact they used to have the job
company on the street that made samples
for like Dorothy Perkins so that's all
the song Chloe used to make and it was a
receptionist I'm gonna go in and see if
Caroline's here and love the sofa
I need to take an antihistamine a
paralyze patted me this and I just feel
like it's not antihistamine she's trying
to put me on some some drugs gonna maybe
go crazy
and we finished our lovely tea and it
was delish and we'd be sending him hours
to clean Caroline's in pain with the
baby oh did you guys enjoy your tea
we've got the girls I mean I know
obviously come to H and I'm having
because we're obsessed with it and we're
trying not spend any money I can't
believe a comment H&amp;amp;M Beauty again I've
already spent fifty
but if I just kind of say the same thing
I'm bit hungry I know at least I would
just had tea but I was quite a long time
ago editing problems so we just have
solution
Anna looks like she's walking somewhere
with a mission so I'm guessing at the
end is it Nick's or NYX well I'm gonna
call it NYX NYX in Selfridges Gotham
chicane is sold out everything so
by exciting somehow me and Anna have
ended up on the designer full of
Selfridges and I'm trying on a wedding
dress more like a designer wedding
dresses just like the dress that's why I
thought why not again I've just walked
in as you know I just made me laugh so
much I walked in to rich watching
football on like dyneins and mineus i
but it just look so stupid obviously I'm
assuming you can't get off the TV that's
why you're doing this yeah that's really
funny
thanks for making me tea my feet are
killing me yes she's actually comfy but
after walking ages and not so country
just you know media riches on his at
third then I put brownies I could
Blondie's hungry there was so many when
I left earlier you've literally eating
them all just put my laptop away and
we're watching knockoffs were on episode
7 that's so good so I'm gonna say good
night and see you guys some other day
this week right good morning lovely
people it is Saturday I don't remember
what day our last vlog but I know it's
been a few days it's a bit miserable out
today I think winters definitely
starting to creep in that lovely autumn
weather has long gone so I'm in kind of
warm clothes and first day of ugh
wearing I know a lot of people hate hugs
but I love them I'll show you quickly
what I'm wearing my white company hi
neck tops I love wearing course like big
and comfy and I wear a long sleeve top
underneath black jeans and my little
ankle which is so comfortable and I'm
going to take my trainers with as well
though just in case we have been
shopping later can't go they're hot and
Uggs indoors this morning we do think a
little bit different we're gonna go meet
my sister and brother-in-law and nephew
and parents I think and we're gonna go
pick slows slows are richer their type
of berry they're a type of berry and you
can use them to make slow Gin and that's
what we're gonna do for next year
because they've got a like sitting
through for ages hopefully there's some
left you might have missed the season
but my sister knows the specific spots
on the heath extension where they have
them so that's where we're gonna go and
meet and we're gonna pick some berries
we're just waiting for my sister to turn
up but I'm really tired cuz you're a
really lazy morning and it's starting to
rain and there's cobwebs in this house I
don't have ruined my eggs so I'm going
to change into some
Elly's wellies on which is doing
Israelis morning Acer pointy-head I
think they've taken the bushes down that
we want to pick from it's not a good
start
was it could come conquer where'd you
find them on the tree
found the brushes with the berries oh
and lots of stinging nettles me and luck
look I don't know
we're all really in the spiky version
it's really quite spiky Ben's literally
in the bush of us there's still so many
to pick
apparently we've got well rich things
holding about kilo there my dad's
holding oh he's got a couple that's
maybe like 17 kilos wow it's apparently
what you have to do next probably
there's a prick each one covered and
rotate them every day every day for you
okay we're gonna get some lunch now all
that slow picking it's exhausting big
night to make you that much I know
you're gonna make that face rich and
been picked so many I'm so happy
hopefully it will work out they were
really soft and right so now we're gonna
go and have some like extra garlicky
pizza and then I went to one of those
you need have those shops in the host
shoot with their black mops and baskets
outside they always have bits and bobs
in there so I went to get some killer
jars we actually needed much bigger but
they're quite hard to find a big one so
I got like as many as I could of this
size and we could it put the slow
berries in there and you basically I
never like to turn them and shake them
every day for two weeks and then space
bleedin like a year and then we'll put
them in something else so
we're now and ask them buying the gin
and it's a lot Jim to be bought oh look
we found it runs oh my god Sloe Gin that
I'm you do a better way hey here's a gin
seven and a half liters of gin
alcoholics over here we've got our jars
and we're gonna give them a good wash
before I start filling them with these
are all the slows that we picked any
weight there and it was at four kilos
that's amazing so and then we also just
put by some point point then what what's
your in jars to make anything and now we
have to go through every single one and
prick a hole in them which is absolutely
the season safety pins
that's how we're going to spend the next
hour
Damien Richard decides to panning here
tonight and which I expect it's quite
good to go who ever cook and wear my
sister's around it's much better to
cooperate further of it they're making
that kind of what we're making like a
Taiwan and easy to Adan soup so I've
just mixed in there coriander stalks
stems stalks chili that's one in there
every she let me draw them across that's
it
just peeling some carrots and putting
them all together with the other veg
dinner's ready and it looks delicious
I haven't logged all night because we
were just sitting on watch an X Factor
and Chile is now 11 o'clock and we're
back home and we've basically got to put
all the jars of sloe gin somewhere dark
so the only place it's dark you know a
flat we haven't got any storage no I
think we're gonna have to put them he
walked in on rich waiting I would make a
great blog the only place we can print
them is in our little copy hole where we
keep our toilet paper so this is not
gonna be the the secrets alcohol stash
area
