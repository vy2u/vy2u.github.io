doing well today is gonna be a vlogging
day it's Wednesday today what is it 18th
of May I think is and I know that my
sister's baby is due this Friday I feel
like she's been pregnant forever she
hasn't even passed her due date yet but
I can't believe she hasn't had this baby
yet she had her first child two weeks
early and she has been ready to pop this
baby out for so long now she's been
miserable she's hated this pregnancy and
I feel so bad for her she's just
desperate to have it so I feel like it's
gonna be any day now and it's really
exciting we don't know if it's a girl or
a boy so I'm hoping she has it like
today or tomorrow or Friday sometime
before the weekend so I can just spend
my entire weekend cuddly and a cute
little new baby I put my hair up in this
like new hairstyle I keep doing it's
called my like lazy day hairstyle where
I could just put up in a barn and then
take some bits out but my hair is so
desperate for a haircut these bits are
far too long to be hanging out of my bun
so I don't know what's going on with my
hair but I need a haircut
ASAP I'm just about to do my makeup and
then I'm heading into town I've got some
meetings today got quite busy day around
London the weather is not great today
it's meant to be raining which is a
shame because it's been quite nice and
sunny recently I'm also going to be
showing you a new product today that
I've been testing out for probably about
a month now actually I've really been
loving this product and it's from Rennes
which is a brand you guys know I already
love it's called the flash defense
anti-pollution mist so this is what the
bottle looks like just so you can kind
of see the size of it so the idea is
that it shields and protects your skin
from free radicals environmental things
that pollution that can really affect
your skin and because I'm out a lot in
London they go on the tube I absolutely
love face mist like this that I know are
going to protect my skin I've actually
been using this for loads of different
things I use it before I do my makeup
sometimes I set my makeup with it
sometimes I just keep it on my desk as a
bit of a refresher and then most of the
time I put it in my handbag and I take
it out with me because the packaging is
so light so like it doesn't weigh
anything it's plastics not glass so it's
really easy to throw it into your
handbag and I've been using it
so what I'm gonna do in today's video is
I'm gonna show you when I use it
throughout the day when I would normally
use it and I'll kind of talk he goes
through it as I use it I need to do my
makeup now and then I need to do a
little bit of work before heading out so
before I get going with my makeup I'm
gonna do a little bit of a quick mist
now I've already done my skincare and
moisturizer and stuff but I absolutely
love the scent I think I will the face
mist I have this is this is the one that
I love the scent the most because it's
quite relaxing which is why I like
putting it on in the tube it's very it's
a very calming scent it says it's
paraben sulfate mineral oil free
petroleum free synthetic free there's a
whole list of things that I haven't got
in it so there's no nasties in there so
that feels really nice it dries down
quite quickly it doesn't feel like
sticky at all on the skin it's just a
really nice light mess so now I'm gonna
go on the rest of my makeup I won't show
you the whole thing but I am gonna be
using my Tarte rainforest of the sea
foundation because I've really been
enjoying this recently sorry I kind of
forgot to vlog the rest of my makeup but
I'm gonna pick my lipstick now and I
think we me is one of the new Urban
Decay ones I've got these to pick from
I'm gonna go for something nude this is
morning after and it's a really nice
sheer pink sometimes I like wearing
sheer lipsticks because you can just
reapply them without mirror and they're
pretty easy hmm I think that's nice I'm
gonna give one last spritz set my makeup
and as I said it's not too wet it
doesn't make this rock makeup at all
which is good okay now I need to do some
work and then I'm gonna pack my bag and
head into town I'm going to take my
whistles backpack game if I want to take
my laptop and this is the only bag I
have on my laptop fits quite annoying
the new laptops
I'm much smaller but apparent you can't
edit videos on them so there's no point
me getting that well my lipstick looks
really pink all of a sudden I hope it
doesn't look that pink in real life so
I'm gonna say this from my laptop so I
can do some work when I get to clean
taking my trusty umbrella because it's
raining I'm gonna take my saline bag as
well because I want to go to Selfridges
I think and find out basically as you
can see on the back of my bag it's
slightly going darker we're obviously
Robb's on my jeans and so I want to find
out how I can clean that and protect it
I'm also gonna throw this in my handbag
it fits perfectly in there and then I
think I'm good to go two things wearing
a rucksack literally just makes you feel
like a school child
second thing why is it when we were at
school I know when I was at school it
was really lame to wear your rucksack on
like both shoulders you had to wear on
one to be cool which I'm sure is why I
have a bad back
how stupid are kids like who cares if
you wear two straps or one I always
heard two straps now and I think it
looks cool change a plan and back in the
flat it's is pouring with rain I don't
wanna get my saline bag wet so I'm gonna
put everything in my rucksack and I'll
have to sue out the bag another day
this is awful I'm hiding under a bridge
because it is torrential rain and my
jeans are getting soaked
okay I got here and I'm just drying off
because my legs are soaking wet
and I got myself a baguette salami
mozzarella courgette and it's delicious
and is here now so I'm lonely anyway let
if you saw a snapchat we all know why we
employ at hand we're going to Charlotte
Street Hotel because we have a quick
meeting and it's like four o'clock so
I'm so ready for Sloane and jam and
cream and tea I really hope that we can
do that that really excites me and so I
hope that the rain is stopped up there
and one coaster a solitary cell and then
come back for another meeting here how's
the day been so far feel any good yeah
yeah really good
that was a nice tea in Charlotte Street
Hotel I had asked or needed that's gone
it was great I really enjoyed it
and it started raining again Emily thank
you okay we're heading back to clean for
a meeting and then I'm late
I just said to honor that I want to cook
you give myself a little spring before
the next meeting to freshen up my skin I
have enjoyed this okay we're literally
we're in the toilet right this is so
glamorous but I was too saying Anna is

sofa for about an hour now because it's
so comfy look I can't feel buddy is I
mean a cab back now we just dropped
George off the Khaleesi and we had a
really nice meal at the East streets I
think it's good which is like a really
nice Asian restaurant in the top coat
I'm going a bit blurry it was a bit like
hot restaurant in this I'm gonna
one more spritz to end the day before I
go home because get my pajamas and take
my makeup off make some makeup makeup
off
so nice I forget the smell every time
I'm home now and I stupidly went on my
phone for like a minute in the cab and
then instantly felt so sick so I'm happy
to be home and not in the back of a cab

gladiator program that I hate cuz it's
scary
