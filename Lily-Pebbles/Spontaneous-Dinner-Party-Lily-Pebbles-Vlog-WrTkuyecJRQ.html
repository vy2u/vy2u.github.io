to start my vlogs with crazy frizzy hair
I mean look this is what my hair when it
dries naturally at the moment I think
cuz I've been colouring it it's just
gone so so dry I'm just about straighten
my hair and then I'll come back to you
when I'm hopefully not looking like a
lion I'm still here straightening away
and just watching YouTube videos and
then I'm gonna do my makeup and I'll
show you guys how I'm gonna do my makeup
today
okay now I'm gonna quit keep on some
makeup because I need to head to a
supermarket my friend Deb's and her
boyfriend Paul are coming around for
dinner tonight we've literally and just
organized it Paul needs to kick needed
to come around and get something and I
said why don't you both come and come
for dinner so spontaneous dinner I get
quite scared like cooking for people
even though they're probably my least
like scary friends when it comes to
light impressing people they're very
chilled and eat normal food we don't
really have like a proper dining table
so it's always a bit awkward when we
have people around and I don't know when
you're cooking for people like the
pressure so do not poison them and to
make it taste good
but I think I've decided I'm gonna make
like a sticky barbecued chicken with a
peach and tomato salad and some like
roasted new potatoes so I'm gonna
quickly do my makeup and then head out
to buy the stuff I need to cook tonight
I'm gonna start by spritzing this touch
juhi mist and then I'm gonna use my
sister Laura CC cream I'm then going to
use my it cosmetics CC cream which I am
loving at the moment and then use my
damp Real Techniques sponge just to pop
that all in if you guys like this makeup
look let me know and I could do like a
popular video on it when I get some time
I've already done like a makeup tutorial
in a while then put a bit of the Urban
Decay Naked skin concealer on for
bronzer I'm gonna use a cream bronzer
from Y so that I absolutely love like
already hit the bottom and I'm using
this brush from Clinique putting it on
like the high points of my face bonds up
a little bit this is Nas deep throat and
then this is the new highlighter from
the Mac trolls collection that I'm quite
enjoying I'm gonna use both of these now
for my brows I'm using the benefit
precisely my brow pencil and the blink
clear brow gel mine isn't very clear
anymore for my eyes I'm going to use
this new eyeshadow quad from Chanel it's
absolutely beautiful yes that is a red
and I'm really enjoying wearing Reds on
my
at the moment so I'm gonna put this on
and then see what it looks like then
this is the also the new eyeliner from
the Chanel collection and this is kind
of like a Moony purpley red so I'm gonna
use this as well finish off the eyes I'm
using this new mascara from Clarins what
does it code just says intense black but
I'm really enjoying this at the moment
so that is what the eye shadow and
eyeliner looks like I don't know if you
can see it's definitely quite ready a
little bit like perfectly tone as well I
really like it I look really pale I'm
standing right by the window but I don't
think I look this pale in real life
excuse the noise my washing machine is
like going crazy but I've just written a
list of food that I need to go by for
dinner tonight
we did do like a weekly shop and plan
our meals tonight we're meant to have
spaghetti bolognaise but we have a
spontaneous idea to have Deb's and Paul
around so I'm gonna go buy this stuff to
make dinner for them so I'm gonna go
meet my mom now we're gonna have lunch
and then go food shopping
don't meet my mom and Leon and perhaps a
quick lunch
just mooching around the shops and we're
in the white company and it's always
smells so incredible in here I've just
found my dream candle fresh-baked and
it's three wick oh my god if you guys
could smell through the camera so good
I'll show you what I got from the white
company when I get home I'm just heading
to wait shows I'm gonna do my food shop
and then head home
I've got everything I need to make
dinner so I'm gonna head back now and
then I'll show you guys how I'm gonna
make the food even though I don't really
know but I just make it up as I go
everyone in the carpark is staring at me
like I'm a crazy person I guess I am I
also haven't stopped laughing all day
about the Dori drama that I accidentally
created on Twitter if you guys saw that
and you're not one of the people that
freaky doubt then you're probably
laughing along with me today and I think
it has been very funny I'm home now and
I've just been hanging up my washing bro
glamorous it's half three so I think I'm
gonna prep the dinner and like put the
chicken in the marinade and make the
salad and then edit a video and come
back to the cooking a bit later when it
gets near the time be honest I haven't
got that much to vlog today and I'm not
really sure why I chose today to vlog
but find it a little bit hard because I
want to do my vlogs every Tuesday but
this week I haven't really been up to
much I've just been at home working and
then this weekend is actually my hen
weekend hen is like a bachelorette party
that we call a hen in the UK so it's me
in like ten of my best friends and I
have no idea what I'm doing a few of my
friends and my sisters have organized it
and none of the guests know what they're
doing either so when you guys see this
vlog I would have been and gone and
survived hopefully in my head I'm so
excited though but I'm obviously not
gonna be vlogging now I'm just gonna be
having like a great time with my friends
so I wasn't sure what vlog I could have
for next week so I thought I would just
try vlogging today and see kind of what
happens although I haven't really been
up to much but I'm gonna make the
marinade for the chicken now I'll show
you how I do that
I think this meal if it works out well
is a good one to like have the recipe
for I don't know where my mum got it
from I think actually she got it from
her on what book it is but I'll put the
link down below of which book is and
I'll put the title of the recipe so yeah
let me get on with that now oh my gosh
I'm having too great an onion and it's
hardly off when you cut onions grating
them that little city go where I know
and I know that if you don't smell it
the eyes aren't water but is really hard
not to bring
which I breathe through my mouth oh my
god this I make up is not gonna be here
in like ten minutes time okay so this is
the marinade for the chicken it's
basically lemon juice celery shallots
garlic ginger tomato sauce cold water
soy sauce mirin American mustard sweet
chili and honey that's everything in
there will should meshed together so
that's why I'm gonna marinate the
chicken him for the like a couple of
hours to three hours maybe you could do
it overnight will you do it for half an
hour I'm just gonna do it until
dinnertime basically okay in here are
the chicken thighs and I've used chicken
thighs because I much prefer the meat on
chicken thighs I think it's much nicer
and I basically rubbed sesame oil and
garlic granules and salt and pepper onto
those and then I'm gonna pour the
marinade I've left like some aside for
later pull that into the chicken into
this like sandwich bag and just let that
marinade put it in the fridge for a
while
marinade it in and you swish it all
around and then I'm gonna keep that in
the fridge
okay so I've prepped the salad I am just
so slow cooking it's taking me all
afternoon
so the salads there and dad's gonna be
here soon because she's coming straight
from work so I've just started kind of
clearing up a bit and laying out the
table now here's some serious small flat
problems we have this gorgeous table for
my stem that I absolutely love but it's
kind of a two-person table and we
normally have these chairs next to it so
I've got these two chairs and then I've
added this little stool which isn't even
comfortable to sit on it's not meant for
sitting and then my office chair which
looks absolutely ridiculous but it's the
only solution to have four people eat in
our flat so I'll probably be the lucky
one to sit on this chair this is so
stupid is literally the smallest table
in the world lucky we're close friends
okay I'm feeling good about this I
haven't panicked yet so I've just put
the chicken in it needs to go in there
for an hour and I need to keep checking
on it and making sure there's enough
sauce there and then hopefully they're
gonna get really like nice and crispy
and sticky and then I've got the extra
marinade here that I'm gonna heat up and
pour on at the end and roast potatoes
with just olive oil some pepper that I'm
gonna put in the oven and there hope
you'll be nice and small and crispy and
then I've got this the pine roast the
toasted pine nuts and sesame seeds I
think in an agave nectar this is to go
on the salad just before I serve it and
salads in the fridge so hopefully this
is going okay it's not too messy things
a little bit messy but for everything
else away
was laid feeling good about life okay
dinner is ready Deb's and Paula here
I won't flog your spot but look I start
showing up salad chicken potatoes you
guys have to let me know after is what
you think rich is here now hello dinner
is done and I have dessert options did
you guys like wait did you like the
dinner Deb's like the marinade you like
the one okay we've got good New York
cheesecake there's two of those and then
there's two goo salted caramel molten
middles ookay and then I thought the
boys would run sauce camera I just think
about this ahead Deb's and Paul have
just left and dinner was a real success
it took all afternoon cooks but I think
it was worth it was really really yummy
I've just painted my nails I've actually
just used the new Chanel nail gloss
which is so wigs it looks like clear
pink gloss but it comes out like a neon
orange it's really really cool I think
I'm gonna do a blog post on that
tomorrow oh yeah we watched them the
naked attraction or something this is
new program on channel 4 and it's so
weird
people basically look each other naked
and judge each other and it's the most
bizarre thing I've ever watched in my
life and it's hilarious to watch it with
friends and that's about it for now me
much better what Tommy ate okay excuse
my lips I've just been trying on blue
and purple lipstick if you follow me on
snapchat you would have probably seen
that it was quite a head area so I think
and then I've just put on loads of like
white creamy lip balm because my lips
were already so before doing that so
excuse the color of my lips but I
thought I'll show you the cushion cover
so I got from the white company today so
I'm gonna put them on the bed rich hates
cushions on the bed but I don't care
because I think they make it really
snuggly and nice even if you take them
off every night so I got this nice dark
grey one they were like 50% off in the
sale so I think they were like 20 pounds
and this one it's really annoying how
they don't come with cushions but
luckily I have some Sun so I got to the
light grey and one of the dark grey and
I'm gonna put them here I've got some of
these like H&amp;amp;M
these the right size so obviously our
bed isn't May
properly but this is what they look like
and I think they're really nice once the
beds made properly we have these like
stupid ones on at the moment big spoon
little spoon but when our nice cushions
are on I think these would look really
cozy especially in the winter and I've
got this like nice throw here Mike
sitting on my bed and this perfect now I
just need like 500 more and that'd be my
perfect bed sorry rich you go get the
idea
very cozy indeed I've just taken on my
makeup off and done my evening skincare
routine I thought I'd quickly show you
some new products I used and really like
the voter voter Evo to read and all this
cool bike talked about in a vlog
recently from Liberty the super seed
cleansing oil and the the facial oil
really really like those so and then I
also tried the fresh bitumen nectar mask
I really liked that as well so I'm gonna
keep using them and see how I get on
with them but good so far I'm gonna sign
off here thank you guys for watching
this video and go and check out my last
one if you haven't I'll see you in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
