I've got doctor's appointment and I'm
gonna walk there because I think it
would be a nice little morning walk it's
about 15 minutes away so I'm gonna head
there now
okay I'm back and just sitting at my
desk I've got quite a few bits to do
this morning so I'm just gonna have a
morning off work okay I'm going to take
some blog photos and I think I've shown
this before it's a giant bit of white
card that I like to sometimes I need a
white background and I just don't have
anywhere white in my house so I like to
use this and I'm going to be taking
photos of these things but my January
posts and I'm using my camera with my
normal kit lens because I find this the
easiest for a blog photos because then
everything is in focus
she's to get with my memory card out I
keep it in this little case there you go
so yeah I'm just gonna take some photos
now
look at this blusher it's coming out in
January it's from Chanel oh my god it's
absolutely beautiful I love what they do
embossing that is so pretty I can't wait
to try it
I've done three sets of blog photos
literally working my way through these
nerds and a won't be done to me
okay I'll show you a bit of post editing
so this is the photo so I don't need to
do any copying because I've taken the
photo exactly where I want it to be but
I am going to adjust the brightness so
that's this one because it's a it's a
little bit dull so I'm just gonna and
pop the brightness a little bit and
probably just leave it there okay I'm
starting a new page in my notepad so
this is January it's a bit overwhelming
when it looks like this and it's
completely blank but I'm gonna draw in
all the lines and kind of start
scheduling the first week because I know
I'm gonna feel super lazy that first
week so I want to get a little bit ahead
if I can yeah I'm gonna do my makeup for
the day of course my hair's really
greasy mmm hopefully it lasts tonight
yeah I'm gonna do my makeup and I
thought I'd show you guys me do my
makeup because I'm that New Year's
tutorial never happened so this can be
like my mini version it's not gonna be
like proper video tool but I have put my
proper camera out because I can't hold
my vlogging camera and do my makeup so
I'm just gonna switch you guys over put
this memory card in this camera and I'll
see you in a second hi you're in the big
camera now I'm probably looking a bit
more HD than I normally do my vlogs I've
got my box of products here and I'm just
gonna do my makeup like I normally do
but I'll show you guys as I go I've
already got on this which I got recently
it's from pixie and it's their flawless
beauty primer and I really like it it's
kind of like a bronzy base but it gives
my skin a little bit of a glow I wore
this just alone with nothing else on my
little walk to the doctor this morning
and I looked at my skin and thought you
know looks pretty good for having no
makeup on so I'm gonna start with
foundation I'm using the NARS sheer glow
foundation because I've really got back
into it recently I'm not sure why I like
to just go back to old favourites every
now and again and this is definitely an
old fairy but you don't need much though
I always forget you just need a really
small amount so I'm gonna put a little
bit on my finger and just put it on my
face this vial is like this most casual
makeup tutorial
ever done he's not really tutorials just
me do my makeup
okay I'm using my Bobbi Brown brush to
blend that in this foundation might be a
little bit pale for me at the moment but
better sweet pale then too dark okay so
once that's all blended into the skin to
think it is now I'm going to do
concealer another one from pixie this is
the brightening OH correction
concentrate in brightening peach and I
thought it's look good because I used to
use the Bobbi Brown corrector which was
like a peach colored corrector and peach
cancels out any dark colors that's good
for dark circles so I'm gonna put a
little bit of that on my finger I use
this yesterday quite liked it and just
press it under the eye I don't think
it's enough by itself and it does help
cancel out the darkness before you put
on your concealer just dabbing that in
the dark but it's right on the inside
and then using my Real Techniques
setting brush to blend it in
alright that's quite a nice base as well
for your concealer helps it stick a bit
better
it is impossible I find it impossible to
put things on my eye area without it be
my mouth though like that and when I'm
editing my tutorials it's so hard to get
Clips where I'm not doing that with my
mouth okay then I'm using my NARS
concealer just under God I'm really
running out of this stuff he's getting
more they go through these so quickly I
guess I use it everyday under my eyes
around my nose and on my chin I think I
might have to get back to vanilla
custard looks a little bit too dark for
me I'm kind of in-between cotyledon
vanilla just a bit annoying I'm just
gonna blend that in I'm going out
tonight for my brother-in-law's birthday
and I can't be bothered to read you my
makeup so I'm gonna do my makeup like
send me nice I can always touch up later
if I need to but it's probably a bit too
heavy for the daytime but oh well
probably not leaving the house much
today anyway I just need to go and get
some wrapping paper
okay runs a time I always do bronzer
before my brows because I might spawn
clear brow gel and once it's wet my
bronzer brush always kind of gets stuck
to it and so I'm just going to use this
little brush from RMK which is actually
quite small but I like it museum I am so
to powder bronzer and I'm gonna sort of
contour with it it's a good shape brush
for that so I'm just doing it in like
this kind of triangle part of my face
there that's where I'm putting my
bronzer you see the difference that
makes and then same here so that's that
part that cut triangle part of my face
and up to my temples as well okay so
that's my bronzing and contouring done
take it down my neck a little bit then
I'm gonna use the same brush because I
left my blusher brush upstairs for Nas
deucer
which is a blusher that I absolutely
love it's kind of plummy very neutral
it's nice when you have a lot of eye
makeup on because it doesn't really
you'll see that's quite subtle making
this weird face because I like to put it
on that pot my cheek if you make the
weird face then it helps you find that
part of your cheek it looks stronger on
camera than it is in real life camera
never picks up true colors okay now I'm
gonna do my brows now that my face is
done using my Anastasia brow Wiz and my
Anastasia clear brow gel I just like to
brush them upwards so I can see the
shape properly and then using the little
pencil on the other end I just fill in
the front parts very very light to hand
it's important to have a light hand when
doing your brows you don't go over the
top and this top part of the end always
needs both filling in nothing drastic
same on the other side yeah that's about
all I do I might redo them later but
that's fine for now and clear brow gel
and essential even on no makeup days
because my eyebrows are like my dad's
and I look like my dad when they go
flying all over the place
okay I shadow time I forgot I primer I
probably would normally put it on but
it's upstairs I'm using the Urban Decay
Naked palette because this is what I was
gonna use my Nia's eh tutorial because I
think a lot of people have it and it's a
good one to use kind of got everything
you need in it I'm a bit obsessed with
half-baked at the moment after Anna used
it in a tutorial and I've just become
obsessed with wearing it so I'm thinking
I'm going to use half-baked which is a
really
Gold and then a bit of toasted and
hustle which is a light kind of pink and
a dark purple because I like plummy eyes
I really like plummy eyes and I think
the lipstick on my own is kind of purply
so they might go this might completely
not go but let's just try so I'm gonna
take a half-baked and put that kind of
all over the lid this is nice even just
by itself it's such a like oh it's a
gorgeous gold color you see as soon as
you put it on wow so pretty it's very
pigmented so you don't need as much as I
just used her okay now I'm going to take
toasted and put it on the second half of
the lid that's what half-baked looks
like by itself just gonna add like a
pinky tone to it
warm up a bit cuz half-baked is quite
like a cool gold
yes that's toasted do the same on the
other eye the shell is a very shimmery
but I think it's pretty this time of
year
okay then I'm taking hustle just a tiny
bit because it's really really strong
color and take it on that outer corner
just do like little circles to blend it
in with this sort of a look you can take
a piece of sellotape and put it there so
you get like a neater line but I don't
really like it when it's that like neat
over line I like it when it's all kind
of blended a little bit for the other
side very with the light hand little
circles to blend it into the outer
corner so that's what it looks like it's
quite pretty really take my big blending
brush and just do like windscreen wiper
motion to blend it all together here in
men taking a smaller brush like this one
from zoeva which is there two three one
petite crease I love this for under the
I think I'm going to take buck which is
just a matte brown just to kind of
define it see my wrath is opening again
it's impossible I'm also going to take a
tiny bit of hustle and the answer
okay so that's I shadow done and I'm
gonna use an eyeliner as well this one
is from Charlotte Tilbury yeah it's one
of her rockin Kohl liners this one is
actually gone tiny then meant to be like
that long but I've used this one so much
it is the shade Elizabeth violet I love
it actually I need to remember to put
this on my 2014 favorites list
definitely a fav I'm gonna just use that
right near the lash line so soft you're
hardly even need to touch so easy to
apply doesn't drag the lid at all today
I'm going to do a really thin line first
of the lashes if you have really bad
eyesight like I do a tip so you don't
have to completely close your eyes it's
just to hold the mirror really low down
it's very unflattering angle for me and
hold it really low down and just look
down and then you can keep your eyes
open because if I close my right eye I
can't really see out my left eye so I
wouldn't be able to apply it okay
eyeliner done and I'm just gonna apply a
bit of mascara Tarte gifted I think I'm
gonna finish this mascara off actually
I've been using it so much recently it's
lovely
feathery lashes and then I'm gonna use a
little bit of a clinic bottom lash
mascara as well because it's Christmas
and I like to have lots of lashes at
this time of year okay that's everything
apart from lipstick I'm gonna try out
this new optional this is part of their
new collections coming out in January
it's number 50 lara Ramon esque and it's
like a really pretty purple but this is
blue toned I'm pretty sure it is it
looks very blue tone and normally I
can't really get away with glue 10
lipsticks but I want to try it out so
let's see how ridiculous it looks I
normally know if it lips doesn't suit me
because my eyebrows start looking
bushier my hair looks frizzy oh and
everything just looks a bit out of place
that's how anyway I can describe it so
let's just apply this and see I might
have to use a lip brush for the outside
this is one of the reuleaux velvet so
it's very easy to apply just drag the
lip
I would never normally go for this color
but boars are pink the pong is quite
similar and that suits me so let's try
see if I don't draw in a Cupid's bow my
lips just look like that so I really
have to like press up against the edge
of my lip okay what I'm gonna do now to
take a little lip brush like this one
from Real Techniques
and just use it on the lipstick and then
draw in an outline it's easier okay
there you go I think it's a nice color I
do feel like it's not gonna stay on my
lips are very long you know in something
is a bit too creamy I feel like that's
not gonna stay put but if you could be
bother to reapply he hasn't really nice
color oh it just feels so nice on their
lips and our lipsticks just does even
feel like I'm wearing lipstick tool um I
think that's nice and I think it kind of
goes with a slight purpley Goldy eye
makeup done I need to head out right let
me switch back to vlogging camera it's
weird to like talk lucky in a proper
camera like this hi I'm back on this
camera so yeah I know I've been going
out recently to like shopping places but
I haven't been getting what I actually
need and I finally I don't know why I've
waited so long but I've written list of
everything I need need to get ISA
another president need to get Bailey
another president you see a wrapping
paper and tags and there's something
else I need to get it's just I need to
go and just do it all because I don't
want to shop this weekend tomorrow night
on Saturday night I want to film some
videos I think my parents might be out
shopping too so I might go meet them so
YouTube have recently added an option to
have ads in the middle of videos and I
don't always use this I haven't actually
used it yet before cuz I thought it
might be a bit annoying but I was
watching for ID last night and they had
like three ads in between their
programming so I thought you guys won't
mind obviously it helps to kind of fund
what I do and make these videos so if
you don't mind I'll try and put them in
an appropriate time so it doesn't like
cut me off mid-sentence or anything and
it's only on videos that are over ten
minutes long anyway and I think they're
skippable so it's kind of just a
five-second quick add hope you don't
mind okay I'm gonna go get some food
back and paper
ticks and things with my shopping list
and I'll be right back okay I'm back
from the shops
excuse my hair soften a bit let me
update you on what I got I got three
rolls of wrapping paper sandpaper place
the one that I was using Gelder's which
is annoying and I got some some gift
tags but it like this I bought a couple
of presents with the kids and some more
presents for my wrist because even the
other room so I'm now gonna wrap all
this stuff up including Ben's birthday
presents tonight more wrapping I'm very
happy that kids don't understand what
good wrapping or bad wrapping is because
this is terrible terrible wrapping I
forgot to tell you guys look what I've
got when I went out two packets of
minimun hands I'm a little bit addicted
to this I'm gonna have to pack it now
okay well we're heading to Colleen bones
were gonna give him his present I've
wrapped and I forgot to put his name on
it and yeah they were going to play ping
pong
whoa rich crash the car why Nana enemy
new song just came on the radio today
this is for you guys happy birthday Ben
came on our way to bounce
already I've come out with an Eskimo Joe
I know this from Zara
it looks very cozy any moment to do it
is camel
so we're the end of the night and we had
it we just had a good night a bounce
part from the Christmas parties and all
the men grabbing Lily naughty naughty
naughty like it was a big stupid make me
cry anyway stupid men grabs Lily on the
way to toilets no me I can't do that so
yeah so we had a good time bounced feels
good actually as well and it's actually
quite a cool atmosphere - all the
grabbing definitely go back again and
now we are on our way home we've left
Lily's sisters and brother laws in a
very intoxicated state quite funny and
we will see you tomorrow on vlogmas day
19 wait my clock hasn't gone forwards
okay i'm home i thought i'd just quickly
add to that because i just watched it
back and i'm not sure it's gonna make
any sense you had a really good night at
bouncers good company and I love playing
ping pong but I think because it was a
big night for Christmas parties it was
literally 80% 20% like male-female ratio
and it was horrible like I like she
couldn't walk the toilet men were like
grabbing my shoulders and shouting at me
and it was really really pissed me off
it's not balances fault it's men's fault
I hate men tonight but drunk men in
London you know wherever it was horrible
by complained and they were very like
they're really nice to us
so I would go back but I probably go
back during the day because it's quite
intense place when there's lots of
people drinking but anyway home now and
ready to go to bed I'll see you guys
tomorrow for vlogmas day 20 oh my god
that means they four days left
