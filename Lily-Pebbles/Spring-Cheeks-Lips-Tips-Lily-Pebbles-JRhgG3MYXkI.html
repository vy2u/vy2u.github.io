going to be about what's new in for
spring but before we get started I just
wanted to chat about a couple of things
first of all so exciting me and Anna are
going to be at it achoo this year which
is a YouTube convention in Milan at the
end of April so I'm going to put all the
info in the description bar below and I
would absolutely love to meet some of
you guys there so if you do live in
Italy or nearby check the description
bar for more info also I've just do
really the comments from my knowledge
max multiple video and thank you so much
to all your comments on my hair it did
look really nice because I've been to a
professional salon for have it done so
that's why it doesn't look like that all
the time
I didn't do it myself so I'm gonna keep
trying but personally I'm just happy I
can get my hair like this so let's get
started looking at what for you to put
up Sam you in for spring
I've got blushes lipstick and nail
polishes as you guys know I'm obsessed
with blusher thing they're one of my
favorite beauty products I literally
can't get enough and I've got quite a
few here to show you first of all from
Revlon they've got I think four new
shades for spring and the two I have are
racing rose and hoped pink know what
could say that word is too hard racy
Rose is a really pristine obviously rose
shade and it's a really nice everyday
shade to wear I like the texture of
these they're just kind of simple powder
blushes but they really pigmented and
they work nicely how to pink or whatever
it's good is a slightly brighter pink
and it really kind of like perks up your
face and this is really pretty I mean
it's like a sunny day to me recently
brought up their cheek pops and these
are
I have had them for a while about over a
month but I haven't reviewed them yet or
mentioned them any work because I really
wanted to try them out properly and get
to know them because they're very
different to normal blushes and I wasn't
sure how I felt about them so they look
like this obviously very cute packaging
and it's like a perspex container and
it's got a flower print on it and when I
first saw these I thought they were
cream blushes just because of the way
they look but when i swatched it with my
finger i realized it wasn't cream it was
kind of a bit powdery really weird so it
turns out I use my Real Techniques
multitasking brush with these and they
go on quite they're definitely one
you need to layer on I'm wearing an
which one I'm wearing today I'm wearing
peach pop which is this one this is
peach pot that mrs. berry pop and they
go on like a powder but they're kind of
creamy and they leave this like pretty
glow on your cheeks I've never tried any
other blusher like this it's like a
hybrid between a powder and a cream
really hard to explain but if you have a
commune counter need which most of you
probably do because it's quite easy to
get hold of definitely try these out I
think they're really cute for spring so
for cream blushes I have these - first
of all at the bobbi brown pop Rouge
they're really popular because they come
in this good little compact and you can
use this on either your cheeks or your
lips you can use it for both and in
their recent collection I think it's
called nectar and nude which was just
such a beautiful collection they release
this shade which is hibiscus and it's a
really pretty coral and I love Bobby
Brown pot Rouge that if you are looking
for a good cream blusher definitely
recommend these it goes on at crema
stays cream so it looks really Julie is
easy to blend and looks fresh my
favourite formula for cream blushes is
just when it's cream stays cream doesn't
sound powdery so I really love that one
but if you do prefer more cream to
powder the Topshop cream blushes are a
cream to powder formula they come in
good packaging as well this is one of
the newer shades let
and they had a few shakes one of them
was - it was like baby pink and quite
glittery so I didn't like that one but
this one's really pretty it's kind of
similar shade so this would probably a
good dupe but it is pruned powder so I
found cream powder a little bit awkward
to apply but some people prefer them so
if you do this is a pretty one
so before I finished the cheek category
I just wanted to throw these in there
not so much a recommendation but I just
wanted to show you guys these are new
from YSL in it they're baby doll kiss
and blush this is a really new kind of
product it looked a bit like a lip stain
you can use it on your lips or your
cheeks I quite like as a lip stain but
it's weird for your cheeks it's just
very dry but it's quite exciting launch
I'm not sure how I feel about them but
worth checking out if you are near a
wire cell counter blips this spring it
seems to be all about sheer finishes
which it always kind of is and I really
like the sheer lip stick I think it's
really easy to apply and it looks pretty
on Tommy would have a new spring line
and they've changed the packaging for
spring in this beautiful white and gold
normally it's black and gold and I think
it's gorgeous
Tom Ford is a really luxury brand so
this is working for everyone but if you
like to invest in lipsticks they have
some really pretty shades there are so
many I have two here this one is summer
fling which is a really nice kind of new
deep Rose easy to wear shade and this
one is firecracker which is an amazing
kind of brighter but it's like a deep
summery red orange really pretty this
would look amazing on people with olive
skin so these do require a lot more
sheer than a normal lipstick switch for
high-end lipstick I always feel like
it's maybe not worth investing if it's
sheer but if you are Tom Ford fan worth
checking these out if you like some more
affordable option the body shop also
have some sheer lipsticks out and this
is part of the color crush range I have
a few shades here they don't
names I've got 14 15 and 16 I think the
one sorry I keep looking down I think
the one I'm wearing today is 16 which is
like kind of pretty rosy coral these
applied really easily no Mara needed
very sheer wash of color they're really
moisturizing and they have slight shine
I just think these are really nice you
know I mentioned the Bobbi Brown nectar
and news connection that came out they
also have a couple of lip glosses in
that collection they had a nude pink and
an excerpt and these are both absolutely
gorgeous if you like really moisturizing
lip glosses these are so beautiful and
pretty for spring but to fro drugstore
alternative Tanya burr lip gloss as I've
mentioned before a great eye never
happen it's like dupes for these colors
the ones I have an afternoon team picnic
in the park picnic in the park it's a
bit more pink than the Bobbi Brown
nectar but I'm sure the tiny bow does
like a coral shade she's got loads of
shades that's all I have for lips
because as you know I haven't been
wearing that much lipstick recently
first of all I want to show you a color
I have been obsessed with since it came
out for spring and this is a late and
any shade it's called bon voyage it's
such a pretty coral bright orange I love
orange nail shades for spring it's a
really good transitional shade as well
when you're kind of going into the
warmer months
barielle have released some more shapes
to their journey line and I've spoken
about this before I love the journey
formula it's like a thick gel had
finished nail polish they lost really
well they go on like two coats
completely opaque and I've got a few of
any shades I've got a sugar apple which
is like a creamy mint blue and I'm
wearing that today then huckleberry
which is I think the nicest one it's a
really really pale blue and I think it's
really chic kind of like when you're
wearing white nails but they're tinted
slightly blue and then the final one is
rosehip which is a soft baby pink and I
love the personals for spring I
literally can't get enough of the past
tools and I think these are really good
finally L'Oreal have released a new
range of nail polish of spring and
they're all really nude colors with a
slight tint so this one is pretty much
white with a slight tint of yellow this
one is pretty much white with a slight
tint of pink and I think they've got a
few other shades I really want to check
out I absolutely
LOL which is called lemon meringue and I
did a block price wariness so I will
link that below there's an outfit post
and it just looks like you're wearing
white but it's not as like tip hex nails
as white looks not harsh and I think
these sort off white shades are really
pretty for spring so that's everything
from my like spring roundup what's new I
know I've taken a bit longer to start my
spring video than everyone else but
personally I don't think spring starts
until April so I've been like holding up
and from now I'm gonna see more spring
videos so he me any requests you have
for any new type of video don't forget
that me and Anna regalia it's achieved
and I'm gonna put all the details below
let me so much for watching check back
on Sunday for my new vlog and I'll see
you guys then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
