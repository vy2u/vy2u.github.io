really well sorry for my appearance
today but as you can tell by the title
of this video today is clean out my
wardrobe day and I'm going to be giving
you guys tips on how to spring clean
your wardrobe I do this twice a year and
I always have going from winter into
spring and then again going from summer
into autumn I like to just clean out my
wardrobe and instead of having
everything in my wardrobe and having it
really kind of overwhelming I like to
just have the stuff that's relevant for
that season so I'm going to give you
some tips on how to spring clean your
wardrobe and this is how I do it so I
hope it helps some of you first of all
the most important thing is get into
comfy clothes tie your hair up like I
have get into your most comfortable
clothes and just make sure you're comfy
then I think it's really important to
clean up the surrounding area of your
wardrobe so obviously if it's in your
bedroom clean up the floor in your
bedroom I'm kind of covered in clothes
and take out the bin just make sure
there's like surface area on the ground
that's free because you're going to need
it to make piles and I also think it
just helps you kind of clear your head
space if everything else is messy around
you it's pretty hard to make a tidy
wardrobe so the first thing I'm going to
do is take everything out my wardrobe
and I know this may seem a bit daunting
and extreme but I think it's the best
way to do it so one by one I take things
off the hangers and I'm going to start
placing it in two piles so as I'm taking
them off I've got four piles going one
is keep one is store one is donate and
one is bin so the bin pile as it sounds
those are clothes that just not wearable
I wouldn't even give them to a charity
shop because they either dirty or
stained or just something like broken
they've got holes in them so those are
going in the bin the donate pile those
are going to go to my sister's first and
Friends to look through see if they want
anything and whatever's left I will take
to my local charity store the keep
clothes is just the stuff that I know
straight away I'm going to probably want
to keep that and then the storage pile
is where I'm going to put my autumn and
winter clothes so my thick heavy jumpers
that are just not appropriate for this
time of year and I actually fold these
up and put them in vacuum pack bags so
these are just really good clear plastic
bags you fold your clothes
and you lay them in and then you kind of
press all the air out and it makes it
really small to store and I either find
a random draw in the house to put them
in or you can store them under your bed
they really don't take up much space so
once I've taken absolutely everything
out of my wardrobe including my draw
that has just become so messy it's
embarrassing I then go through my keep
pile and for this I like to go through
item one-by-one and society if I'm
definitely going to keep it or not
and if some things I'm unsure about I'll
definitely try them on I'll recommend
trying on as much as you can looking in
the mirror getting a second opinion if
there's someone else in the house and if
you can't and try and take a photo of
yourself and then look at the photo
because kind of easier to get
perspective when you're looking at photo
rather than just looking in the mirror
I'd say definitely try and be brutal if
you have almost something in a year
don't keep it I've done that before and
passed and it's just sat in a drawer for
another year and there's just no point
because someone else might really enjoy
wearing that item so now my wardrobe is
completely empty I'm going to give it a
proper clean because really how often do
you get to clean it inside of your
wardrobe when it's just full of clothes
it's quite a rare occasion that you have
your wardrobe empty like when you first
bought it so I'm just taking some kind
of standard cleaning products and just
getting rid of any dust and there
actually is quite a lot of dust dolled
up so I'm going to be cleaning that out
cleaning the inside of the drawers and
way up the walls if you get moths in
your wardrobe and you might not even
know you do because I've personally
never even seen a moth but I know that
sometimes I can get tiny little holes
especially on the bottom of my tops and
that's a sign that you've got moths in
your wardrobes but the smell of
mothballs I don't know if any of you
remember like mothballs that people used
to use back in the good old days stink
but you really don't have to use
anything like that anymore there's so
many good products for keeping moths out
of your wardrobe
my friend jenny from manhattan closets
gave me a really good tip for hanging
this special little kind of potpourri
cone in my wardrobe and this is filled
with all kind of nice smelling things
like lavender and so not only does it
smell nice but it also has sada wood in
it which helps keep the moths away
there's quite a few ingredients and the
certain smells that the moths just
really don't like I also like to spray a
bit of kind of wardrobe spray inside
while it's empty just to give it a nice
fresh scent so now I'm going to be
putting my clothes back in the wardrobe
and I personally like to use quite
specific hangers I used to always
collect the Topshop hangers so I do have
a lot of those in there this little tip
if you are buying clothes from Topshop
you can ask to keep the hangers and
they'll really they're happily given to
you and they are good ones I've recently
started buying non-slip rubber hangers
and these are really good because not
only do they stop any kind of dents in
the shoulders of your clothes but
they're non-slip they look really nice
and I also have the ones for trousers
which are really good because you just
kind of hang the trousers over them and
it keeps everything really compact and
looking neat and they're non-slip and a
bit obsessed with these hangers so I'm
putting everything back in one by one
and I think everyone has a personal
preference on how they like to put
things in their wardrobe I don't do
things kind of color-coordinated because
personally I don't wake up and think I
want to wear an orange top I think I
want to wear a shirt and jeans so I put
my clothes in buy shirts jackets going
out tops t-shirts jumpers I kind of put
them like in collections like that
my aim for this spring wardrobe
clean-out was to kind of hang as many
clothes as I could because personally I
prefer hanging clothes because then I
can actually see what's there when
clothes are in drawers I never end up
wearing them so this time round I've
only kept my basic vest tops and plain
long-sleeve tops in the drawer and
everything else is hanging for the
drawer I like to fold my clothes instead
of folding them on top of each other so
the things on the bottom you never
really see I like to fold them like this
I think that means you can see all your
clothes and it looks nice it's so much
easier to canaveral so that's the end of
my spring wardrobe cleanup I ended up
with two giant bin bags of stuff to
donate one giant bin bag of stuff to
throw away and I feel really kind of
refreshed and spring-like and now that
my wardrobe is all clean and new I can
go out and buy new clothes and feel like
when I put them in my wardrobe they
won't get lost amongst all the old
rubbish so I hope you found these tips
really helpful let me know if you also
like to sprinkly in your wardrobe and if
you have any other tips that I didn't
mention I love a good wardrobe
organization thanks so much for watching
and I
