spring fashion haul and there are a
couple of things a bit annoying about in
this video I just get out there first of
all I think by the time this video goes
up I would have had my hair cut like
there maybe I'm getting my hair cut in
three days time so that's bit annoying I
had to film today just because of like
my schedule so that's one thing and two
is that I've got a new handbag coming
from New York my best friend who lives
in New York I've sent it to her and
she's bringing it back this saturday and
i would have already had that by the
time this goes up to and i'm annoyed
that i can't include that in this hall
but that's just timing so i'm going to
get on and show you what I fought I just
picked up a few things recently and it's
been a bit Sonia in London so it's made
me want to buy spring plates even though
I know it's probably gonna last about
two days and then go back to being
horrible but I want to buy some things a
bit of color because my wardrobe is very
kind of monochrome which I do like
because then it means i can wear bright
colors here and there and just
everything else black and white but I
really need some more color in my
wardrobe so I picked up a few things yes
they're mainly from H&amp;amp;M and a bit Zara
do i'll show you what i got the first
thing you've already seen because i wore
in my Q&amp;amp;A video and it's this t-shirt
from monkey i love monkey I think they
just do such good affordable clothes so
this is just a really nice grey t-shirt
and it's kind of a little bit
see-through and on the front it says
black and I didn't actually reload this
to live at home on the back it says is
back which is quite funny and yeah I
really like that it's just a really nice
kind of loose fit and it's really
comfortable and because it's kind of
gray as well it kind of goes with my
monochrome wardrobe I can wear with
black skinny jeans and a little jacket
on top it's just easy it's nice to have
kind of a few different t shirts to wear
and I just think the shape flatters me
the next thing is a scarf and it's from
zara and i absolutely love this it
basically just looks like this it's
multicolored kind of neil and it's got
blue yellow orange purple all kind of
mixed together it looks like splattered
paint and i just think things like this
really nice a lot of my scarves are
quite grey and brown very wintry color
so i wants to get something colorful i
can just put on and inject some color
into my outfit and I love zara scoff
this was 25 pounds
I think quite reasonable the scarves are
a really good quality and they do kind
of still keep you warm because in London
even when it's kind of spring it's still
quite chilly so it's nice to have scarf
to keep you warm but also to accessorize
your outfit next up is quite a different
purchase to me I have a couple of
weddings coming up this summer and I
don't really ever have anything to wear
to weddings the dresses I used to wear
to weddings a bit too young and little
girly for me now so I wanted something a
bit more sophisticated and sonic
flattering so I saw this and topshop
tried Iran and fell in love so even
though i'm not going to have to wear it
for quite a long time and i probably
won't even wear it that often I really
wanted to buy it and it basically looks
like this at the top it's just got quite
a simple round neck and then it's got
little tee shirt sleeves and then it's
quite long it goes to just above the
knee and and it's quite structured as
you can kind of see at the front it's
got these panels so it's quite fitted
dress I got into 10 I normally buy
clothes in 10 or 12 depending on what it
is but this is quite a fitted dress so
put in a 10 obviously the color is like
bright orange which I just think so nice
for summer weddings and I have no idea
what she is I'm going to wear with this
because I don't really wear heels but
you have to wear heels of the dress like
this so I'm going to find maybe like a
midi heel and i also have to find good
underwear to wear this because it is
quite tight but i just think it's really
small it's got a sip that goes all the
way down the back and it just reminds me
very like business woman ii and i wish i
had kind of important meetings to wear
this to but my life is just not that
cool but i love it and i just think it's
really nice color and i think i'll feel
really nice in it and that dress was 46
pounds which is quite a lot but it's
really good kind of quality is quite ok
so now i'll show you what i got from
hmmm and the first thing was completely
inspired by laura from by now blog later
I saw her purses on Instagram and it's a
little vest top from their conscious
collection and kind of feels a little
bit silky it's really basic it looks a
little bit like underwear but what I
really like is at the bottom it's got
kind of scalloped edge which I just
think is really pretty detailed I think
this would be nice in the summer to wear
under little cardigan or a jacket or
it's just a really kind of basic top you
can wear lots of different ways but i
like that i had this
because most my vest tops are quite
tight and just cheap they're like three
pounds from pennies and so they're not
really nice do you worn on their own but
this is more of a nice top to wear on
its own so yeah I really like that that
was 1499 it's quite a lot for a rest
stop but it does feel like quite a nice
quality and I think I'll get a lot where
around that next major name is my
favorite purchase I love this top it is
a shirt this was twenty nine ninety nine
thirty pounds and it's striped it's like
grey stripes on white and I've just roll
the sleeves up a little bit and it's
quite a loose fit i bought it in a 12
because and the 10 was a little bit
tight round here I prefer the loose fit
but what I really like about this shirt
is it's so soft I don't know what it's
made out of says it's a hundred percent
liar Kel lyocell I don't even know what
that is but it's really really soft and
that's what I really liked about it and
it's just really comfortable I think it
would look nice with jeans or like
tucked into something I just think
there's loads of ways to wear it and I
love that even though 30 part is quite a
lot for H&amp;amp;M I think it's worth it i'm
gonna wear this a lot you can wear it
under sweaters as well the next thing is
a cardigan from H&amp;amp;M this was 799 which I
think it's quite far because I'll
probably weds a lot in the spring and
summer and it's this really bright
cardigan it's like a bright pinky coral
and it's kind of short sleeves it goes
to just the elbow and I've rolled up a
little bit cuz i don't really like
seeing the edge of sleeves and but it's
just like a little card again and i
think that'll really nice over the white
vest stuff as well and use wherever
t-shirts or anything and I really need
cardigans because I have a lot of tops
and I don't have anything to wear on top
I just kind of put my coat on so I need
some cardigans and this is a good fine
and then finally very similar this is a
key same color as the cardigan this is a
jumper that was 14 99 and it's like a
loose knit jumper it's got three-quarter
length sleeves again I'd probably roll
those up and it's quite long which i
like i like with tops and longer but yes
the same color just really nice and
bright I definitely need some color in
my wardrobe so I'm really liking this
kind of Coralie color the H&amp;amp;M are doing
so that's everything I hope you like
seeing what I bought to my little spring
haul hopefully I won't be spending any
more
money because I've just spent too much
money on clothes recently but I'm glad
that I've got some more kind of spring
clothes because a lot of my clothes are
black and gray a little bit boring thank
