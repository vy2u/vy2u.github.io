be giving you a little bit of
inspiration of spring showing you my
makeup hair nails and outfit I'm gonna
start with my makeup and I think the
long-lasting makeup in the warmer months
it's all about lights layering for my
base I'm going to start with the Olay
Total Effects pore minimizer CC cream
this can be used as a CC cream but it
can also be used as a primer which is
what I am using it for
it's very sheer coverage so it works
great as a primer and it has a slight
tackiness to it which means that it's
really good under your foundation or BB
cream or whatever you want to use this
definitely sits somewhere between makeup
and skincare but I really like the smell
of this and I think it works really well
is like a skincare primary base so I
just apply that evenly all over my skin
and then I'm gonna be using a really
light foundation this is the Charlotte
Tilbury light Wonder and I like to apply
this with my hands sometimes again
there's light layers really help your
makeup last and I'm just applying it
with my fingers where I need the
coverage so I'm just applying it on my
chin and all around my face really
around my nose but using your fingers
means that you can really work into the
skin and you can build on those layers
as much coverage as you need or one this
is a really really nice light foundation
it's got slight kind of shimmer
particles in it but nothing glittery it
just catches on the light really nicely
and it's a really nice foundation for
spring/summer I think I wore it all
summer last year I'd like to use my
concealer to add any coverage where I
need it so I'm using my Urban Decay
Naked concealer I'm still obsessed with
this just on my chin around my nose down
my nose under my eyes and on any other
blemishes I'm not going to use my
fingers to blend this in because I find
it a little bit messy with concealer but
I'm going to use my setting brush and
just buff that into the skin so I'm
gonna do something a little bit
different here and this is a new product
from Chanel is part of their LePage
collection and it's the all-in-one
healthy glow fluid SPF 15 this is like a
liquid bronze it smells just like all
the Chanel products it smells so good I
have that salaita tan cream bronzer it's
quite hard to work with I do like it but
I find this much easier to use so it's a
liquid bronzer I like to Pat a little
bit into the contours of my cheeks in a
sort of triangle shape and I like to
pass it
little bit with my fingers to kind of
get it going with the blending then
taking the Real Techniques contour brush
I just blend that in and this is so so
easy to blend out and share out it's
really nothing to orange or to brown
it's very subtle and so so pretty you
could probably put this all over your
skin if you really wanted to bronze
things up but I'm just gonna put it into
the contours of my cheekbones up into my
temples and take the excess just over my
nose so it has that nice sunkissed
bronzy look so I just want to set a bit
at the foundation and conceal it in
place but I don't want this to be a
heavy powder look at all so I'm gonna be
using my hourglass ambient lighting
powder in diffused light because these
powders are so so lightweight and you
can really hardly see it on the skin so
I'm just gently patting that onto my
chin around my nose under my eyes which
is where I need to kind of set my
concealer in place this is also a new
product and I really like wearing
highlighters in the spring summer I kind
of wear them all year round but this
one's new from Charlotte Tilbury look at
the packaging and that is so so pretty
it's called the dreamy Glo highlighter
as parts of her Norman parkinson
collaboration range it's just the
packaging is dreamy but the product
inside is really pretty as well it's
kind of a light pinky gold highlight and
I love those golden undertone highlights
they see me much better than the white
highlighters so this is really nice just
on the tops of your cheekbones it's not
too much so you can definitely wear them
during the day it's just a very subtle
highlighted glow so I've added a bit of
bronze with the Chanel fluid but I still
feel like I need a little bit of a flush
to my cheeks and I always like to wear
blush it with any look so I'm going to
be using this new one from Kiko that I
bought recently it's the mosaic blush in
new sand rose this is so pretty
I instagrammed this recently and you
guys all seem to like the look of it
it's this got this really pretty mosaic
pattern to it so it's got a bit of Rose
a bit of taupe in there and some lighter
highlight shades as well so you could
probably use this right up into the
cheekbones as a highlighter as well but
it's a really pretty rosy blush before I
do my eyes I always like to fill in my
brows and for this I use the Anastasi of
broadway's and just fill in the fun
parts of my eyebrows and slightly on the
arch and then I like to set it in place
with a clear brow gel okay now onto the
eyes I'm going to be using my Urban
Decay Naked 3 palette I really like
pinky purple tones during spring and
this palette just kind of has it all
it's got such pretty shades in here I
really really love this palette but the
two shades that I always tend to go for
are liar and noona so I'm gonna take
liya all over the lid a really light
dusting I just take it off in the back
of my hand first and then lightly dust
it all over the lid with a big fluffy
brush I then take nuna which is a matte
kind of lilac II taupe shade take that
into the crease and I also like to take
that under the eye as well and I think
this look is very subtle it's nothing
too much but it's really pretty and easy
to wear to go with the purpley tones in
the eyeshadow I'm going to use my
Charlotte Tilbury eyeliner this eyeliner
is getting so small I've used so much of
it it's the Elizabeth violet so it's a
purple eyeliner it's kind of a more
plummy purpley Brown so it's very easy
to wear if you are scared of purples but
I love this and they just like ticket
really close to the upper lash line and
then blend it out with a brush and again
it's nothing drastic but it just adds a
little bit of volume to the top lashes
and it finishes the look I always think
I look a bit sleepy when I don't wear
eyeliner the mascara I have been using a
loving recently is from Max Factor it's
their masterpiece glamour extensions
three-in-one volumizing mascara the
packaging is huge but I like this
because it's got a really small comb
wand so I feel like it really combs
through the lashes from root to tip
really easily I liked the other
masterpiece mascara as well that came
out before this but actually think I
prefer this one it's got one of those
little plastic brushes and it's just
instant length and volume I use the
black one of course I always use luck
and then finally for my lips I don't
like to wear too much on my lips during
spring I just find that a matte lipstick
is sometimes too heavy and I just like
wearing like a little glossy bomb or
something and these are new from Max
Factor there's actually loads of colors
in the collection this one is refined
rose and it is like a tinted lip balm
they come in these really handy little
tubes to fit in your handbag and they're
just really sheer and moisturizing but
they still have good color there's like
a red and an orange and they have
actually quite a strong color but in a
sheer barmy way that's very comfortable
to wear and very easy to apply I love
the color rose on lip
and I think it kind of goes with the
slight purpley tones in the eyeshadow so
now let's talk about hair and as you
guys know I hardly ever do anything with
my hair I've got very difficult very
curly hair that once I've straightened
and kind of put waves through I just
want to leave it there and you know it's
really I find it quite difficult doing
styles hair styles but the look I've
done today is very easy for people who
don't like to do hair styles so it's
definitely nothing fancy I'm sure it
won't impress many of you but I really
like wearing it in spring and I wore it
a lot last year when I'm it's festivals
so I started with my hair already
slightly wavy from this morning I also
put in a bit of the Obey dry texturizing
spray this morning when I did my hair
and then what I do is I separate the
front section from my hair and take a
small section and just plat it back so
it's not a French plat I can't do French
plats but these are really easy it's
just a simple plat one tip I would say
though is to plat in the direction
you're going because if you plat down
and then you pull the plat backwards
there's going to be a huge kind of bump
so plat it backwards and then I just
clip it at the back using three or four
kirby grips I do the same on the other
side and you're left with what looks
like a slightly impressive hairstyle but
it's actually really easy to do and I
think it's really pretty I like to keep
these front bits out because it flatters
my face shape better and I've got lots
of kind of baby hairs here that I'd like
to cover up you can tuck the hair behind
your ears as well if you want to to
finish off the hair I like to use a bit
of serum in the ends because my hair can
get quite frizzy especially when I've
been playing with it this one is from
Pantene it's from their expert
collection and it's the Hydra
intensified velvet cream infusion so I
just take one pump of this and run it
through the ends on my hair and it kind
of locks everything in place serums and
creams are great in my kind of hair
because it makes it a little bit more PC
gets rid of all the frizz and just I
feel like it's just holds together
better this also makes your hair feel
really soft on my nails I'm wearing a
swan yay nail polish I think that's how
you say it I'm never quite sure this
shade it was so hard to read the shade
names this is blue der gay Bleu de gay
ID I might have to google this and find
out I'll put it in the description box
below but it's a very pretty
bluey green you guys know I love my
bluey greens
this is like the darker version of
s-see Maximilian Strasser which I really
really love but yeah I just always go
back to blue greens I think this is a
really nice one and I'm really impressed
with this one year nail polishes they
always do a really good job so that's my
hair makeup and nails done and now I'm
just gonna leave you with my outfit so I
really hope you enjoyed this video let
me know what you think of the hair
makeup nails and outfit and please pray
for spring in the UK bring on the
sunshine we really need it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
