spring style guide if you've seen my
autumn and winter style guides you'll
know how these work already if you
haven't then I will link them below and
basically there are three categories
style home and nails I don't really talk
about makeup and beauty as much because
I do that all the time this is something
a little bit different for the season
ahead
so I'm going to start with style and
personally in spring I like to revamp my
wardrobe the weather changes and spring
summer clothes are so much more fun than
autumn/winter do I've been adding a few
new things into my wardrobe and i'm
going to show you three of my favorites
first of all this white leather jacket
from River Island I love where I leather
jackets all year round but sometimes a
black leather jacket can just be a
little bit too heavy in the warmer
months so I really like this one it's
actually kind of a bit more cream but it
looks really kind of good quality feels
good quality as well and although a
white leather jacket is a little bit
risky I've been wearing it and I think
I've got away with it i will put some
photos and link to my blog post below
where i wore it it's a really nice soft
leather and I feel like if you're
wearing jeans and a t-shirt a white
leather jacket just makes the outfit bit
more summery than a black leather jacket
would as you guys know I like to wear
black a lot but when it comes to spring
I like to introduce some prints into my
wardrobe I really like loud bold prints
and at the moment Oasis are killing it
with their prints I have bought so much
stuff I'm not going to show you because
I want to save all for a spring/summer
hall but i definitely recommend going
into Oasis because they have so many
nice prints at the moment i'll show you
one item it's this top and it comes with
matching shorts and i know some people
probably wouldn't wear them together but
i like to wear this together i will
insert a photo here of me wearing the
outfit they posted on my Instagram which
is at Lily pebbles by the way and I got
so many compliments when I wore it I
love how looks together and I literally
bought four or five things from Oasis
all different prints their current
collection is amazing my final pick from
star category are these mono white
converse so I call them 10 whites
because they haven't got the red line
around the bottom that most converses do
so they called mono white because they
are completely white and I love these
I've been wearing them so much I just
love the fresh look and much prefer them
to the converse to have the red which I
think can look a little bit young these
are slightly more kind of classic I
really like them they're so comfortable
some reason I find these ones more
comfortable than converse I've tried in
the past and not sure what that's about
I think these aren't really nice with
jeans and with little dresses and shorts
they're so versatile definitely a good
investment for the warmer months ok so
now onto home and I love kind of spring
homeware &amp;amp; just brightening up for the
home and
making everything look a little bit more
summery the first thing I want to show
you is from oliver bonas which is a shop
I don't know if it's just in the UK
sorry if it is but it kind of everywhere
around London and there it is a really
nice gift shop and they do really nice
home where and books and everything and
I pick this up a couple of weeks ago and
it's a cushion I know it's strangely
excited about cushion but i love this
cushion it looks like this it has neon
orange and black stripes and it's just
so cute I think it's really pretty and
spring-like and something a bit
difference but your sofa or your bed or
wherever you want to put it it's really
like good quality textured cushion cover
as well they also you don't just buy the
cover actually comes with the cushion I
really love this I think it looks really
pretty and something a little bit
different for spring/summer look how
cute these are I picked these up from
Sainsbury's and their Sunday glasses
like for Sunday ice creams I've got a
pink one a blue one and a green one and
these were one pound fifty each which i
think is amazing I just love them
they're so cute I think they'd be so
good if you're having a little summer
garden barbecues or anything like that
and you want to set up some ice cream or
just fruit or even drinks you could use
these for so many things if you were to
use them for ice cream Sainsbury's also
sell this which is one pound fifty and
it looks like a little ice cream it's
actually an ice cream scooper and it has
this thing you press to kind of release
the ice cream scoop once you've scooped
it I think that is really cute and it
goes really nicely with these if you
were to use them for drinks then I would
recommend picking up some paper straws
which I know kind of a bit like
Pinterest e but they are really really
cute I got these from tiger they're kind
of par finished now but it came with
some stripy ones and some with hearts on
it and how you always have different
ones but whenever I go in there they
kind of have different prints but these
are the ones they had at the time I
think paper stores are really cute I
know you can only kind of use them once
and they go a bit funny actually all
stores you can use once but they are
more expensive I just think they look
really nice if you do have a summer
barbecue or special occasion it's
something pretty to put in your drinks
final item for my home category is a
vars and I don't have it here because
it's actually got flowers in at the
moment silencer to cut away i bought
this from H&amp;amp;M home and i absolutely love
it it's really versatile i feel like you
can put any flowers in and it's always
going to look nice it's really simple
design it has like half frosted glass on
the bottom
the top half is clear it's a really nice
shape and I'm just really happy i bought
this i don't think i had owned my own
vars before like a proper vies i was
just found whatever was there and i
really like this this has been living in
my office and i've been putting flowers
in it's making me feel a lot happier
okay so now onto nails which is probably
my favorite category you guys know I
love my nails I've got three very pretty
spring-like shades here the first one is
models own beach bag I've been obsessed
with it since the minute I put it on my
nails this is part of their collection
which is like tan enhancing so their
colors that make your hands look more
tanned and if you have a tan they look
really amazing so I'm excited to wear
this when I go on holiday in August it's
a really bright kind of neon orange but
kind of muted down it's not like an
obnoxious neon orange it's a really
pretty neon I love this shade but I know
that Anna had a really hard time trying
to find this so if you did one it might
take a while to find it in store I think
what a zone is sold on a source though
so I will try and find a link online to
this and will link it below the next one
is from Barry and this is part of their
spring collection in their jelly range
and this is called sugar apple and it's
just a really pretty light blue it
slightly brighter than a seeming candy
apple and I really like the formula of
these they're really kind of thick and
gel like and something about the shade
I'm so drawn to it every time I take off
my nails I just want to repaint it again
with the shade it's so pretty and I love
a good kind of sky blue for the summer
next up is topshop nails in this color
is called skip and it's a pretty pink I
don't want pink on my nails that often
although today I'm kind of wearing a
pinky purple but this one's really
pretty it's girly without being too kind
of little girly it's kind of like it's
like a lipstick pink is a bit similar to
my lipstick today I just think this is
really pretty and I love wearing this
during the spring all I have done so far
so if you're into pink nails that
definitely recommend topshop skip whoa I
caught it in the other hand so that's
everything from my spring style guide i
hope you guys enjoyed that i love
filming these videos i just love doing
like other things that aren't just
beauty I love the home category
especially you guys wait till I get my
own place I'm going to be doing home
videos every week so I hope you're
having a nice spring so far and if not
maybe this got you in the spring mood
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
