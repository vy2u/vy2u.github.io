video but this time it's a little bit
more summery I've been doing a bit of
shopping over the past maybe a few weeks
some of the stuffs a little bit older a
few months ago and I thought I'd put it
all in one video for you guys in case
you weren't aware I have started
vlogging every single day so I'm doing
something called everyday May which
means I'm vlogging everyday I'm only
uploading Monday to Friday and then I've
got a main video on Sunday but I'm
actually vlogging everyday if that makes
sense in Monday's video will be of
Friday and the weekend so I really hope
you guys enjoy that I know a lot of you
loved vlogmas and you've been asking me
for a while to do vlogging everyday and
it was quite a big decision because it's
quite a big commitment and I am still
very scared of it but it's definitely
happening so I really hope you guys
enjoy that so let's get started with
this whole lots of very summery bits
because last week a night before it was
so hot in the UK it's now kind of gone
back to winter so that is a shame but I
am going to LA in July and hopefully the
weather will improve here so I thought
to get some summery bits now while all
the good stuffs in the shop they bring
you an autumn winter stuff way too early
so the first thing is a playsuit and
this is from ASOS it's actually from
their reclaimed vintage range which I
don't really even know what that is but
it's a sauce owned but it must be kind
of vintage stuff I'm not really sure
what it means but it's a really nice
stripy play seat you guys know I love
stripes this was slightly high necked
which I can't always get away with
because I have slightly bigger boobs but
I like this one and the material
slightly thicker as well which is good
in the UK because it means it won't be
too cold it's elasticated at the waist
and then it's just shorts and they're
not too short as well which is important
I think it's maybe not the most
flattering thing around my tummy area
but when I'm hot and I just want to wear
kind of a place suit you know I don't
really care how flattering it is I
really like it so that was a good little
boy from ASOS and then I bought loads of
shorts without really meaning to from
all different places and they're
actually quite similar as well so
obviously a theme going on this first
pair from Urban Outfitters and I think
my friend Deb's has a pair like this
from last year so I knew that they'd be
nice
they're quite high-waisted but they're
quite a loose kind of heavy material so
it looks a bit like a skirt this print
is just a really nice light beige with a
floral print and then they have
a little bit lace detail at the bottom
which I really likes it makes them look
slightly longer than they are and I just
think this material is really flattering
but they're high-waisted they're not too
short really easy to wear they have
pockets which is really nice as well and
I just wear this with a little kind of
vest top top it in or a little jacket
it's a much easier way of wearing shorts
than like a really tight pair of mini
denim shorts or something that you feel
bit uncomfortable in these are very
comfy
I also a similar pair from Topshop and I
love these because I think you can wear
these in the evening as well because
they can be kind of smart and up so it's
a black shorts with this kind of neon
yellow print and I really really love
these again they're high-waisted that
they're that kind of heavy material that
hang nicely and these have like an extra
long bit of lace at the bottom I love
this style
these were around last year I never got
my hands on any I think sorry did some
nice ones so I'm really happy to have
these and I definitely want to get more
again it just makes the shorts feel
longer in a nice way and I think these
with a pair of boots would look really
cool
next pair of shorts are from H&amp;amp;M and
this was sort of day where I really
wants to go shopping but I felt very
uninspired and I kept kind of just going
into shops and not finding anything I
liked but then I went into H&amp;amp;M on Regent
Street and I saw that the mannequin was
wearing this outfit I thought that is a
really cool outfit so I found all the
bits tried it on and like the whole
outfit so I kind of just bought the
outfit well the shorts and the top the
shorts are these little kind of faux
suede shorts in a camel color and I
didn't realize that these apparently
everyone's obsessed over and they've
been sold out I had no idea I just
picked them up so look H&amp;amp;M and Regency
have loads when I was there I really
loved this whole like suede seventies
trend I think it's really really cool I
would love a suede jacket with like
tassels but the fake ones seem to look
really cheap and the real ones are
really expensive so I haven't really
found the perfect one yet but these faux
suede shorts are really cool they are
elasticated which i think looks a little
bit cheap but you can wear a top that
covers that or a belt maybe but they're
really good length they're very
comfortable I wore them on a really hot
day last week and I didn't feel kind of
hot and sweaty so that is good because
we've kind of faked materials you never
really know and then the top to go with
those is a shirt I only really have one
white shirt and it's huge it's really
really oversized so I like the idea
another one that was a little bit more
fitted but still kind of loose this is
really really see-through so sorry in
there cutaways you definitely can see my
bra but it's just a really easy white
shirt and I think it looks really nice
with the shorts and you can wear it with
jeans or with anything really just a
very easy shirt to wear and nothing
special just a white shirt on the same
day I also picked up this from H&amp;amp;M and I
just am not sure how I feel about this
one can I just say that the camera
definitely adds weight on because this
looks better in real life than it does
on camera but it's just kind of weird
and I'm not sure if I like it or not
I'm still thinking about it from there
hmm conscious range and it looks a bit
like a dressing-gown but I thought also
that it could be quite smart casual and
like a summers day where I have a
meeting it's this really nice blue color
I love the color and it's a bit like a
shirt but it's elasticated around the
middle and then it does up with a tie
and it has pockets so it looks a bit
like a dressing-gown but then I saw a
girl wear it she looked really smart so
I haven't quite cited it also has slight
shoulder pads in it which gives it a bit
more structure but also looks a bit
strange I'm not sure how flattering it
is around my tummy my waist is kind of
my smallest part so it's good that it
ties up there but then I think it also
makes my hips look bigger
I don't really know it wasn't that
expensive I don't think but I need to
find a receipt and decide whether to
keep it or not I'm not sure but I think
it's cool I wanted to try something
different and be a bit brave so that's
what I did with that the next top is
from Urban Outfitters I got this one I
got the shorts and it's not very summery
it's not very exciting but I wear these
sort of tops all the time it's just a
grey slouchy loose knit top it's got
slight kind of batwing arms and slightly
longer at the back and front than it is
on the size just so comfy and easy
awarness every day since I got it love
these tops for layering and then I also
found this top in monkey I love monkey
this is in the same material as my
weekday shirt which I know is owned by
monkey that's probably why it's a really
nice heavy feels slightly suede like
material and it's just a vest top they
have this in camel as well I need to go
back and see what other colors they have
because it's just a really nice shape
it's quite short so it's really nice to
wear with high-waisted trousers and
shorts it's nice to wear under little
jackets it's just so versatile I've been
wearing this little vest top so much I
don't really like to get my arms out
but it's really nice under jackets and
it will be great for the summer with
denim shorts as well a while ago when I
was in cause this is quite a few months
ago I've just forgot to show you guys I
picked up this necklace I saw it and
just thought it looks really nice it's
rose gold it's got this long chain and
it's like a half what do they call like
a horseshoe shape like a nearly a circle
with a bit cut out and it's just really
nice it sits really nicely what I'm
wearing tops it's just I wanted to add
something so you made you do a
collection all my long necklaces I was
getting really bored of and I thought
this looked a little bit special so I
really like that from cause they do
really nice jewellery okay the final
thing are a pair of shoes from Topshop
and they're these slip ons I've really
wanted some casual but kind of smart
looking slip ons I only really have
boots and sandals I didn't really have
anything that fit this category I have
other slip ons but they're really saw
and they always hurt my feet so I'm
hoping these down there were only 20
pounds so I thought it's kind of a good
risk to take they're not that expensive
they're from Topshop they're from the
bit that with all the hanging shoes are
and they have this kind of faux snake
black effect on them and they're really
comfy so far and I just think they're
really nice because you can wear them
with smart trousers or you can wear them
with jeans or with shorts they're really
kind of easy to wear with any look and
very easy to get on and off as well so
that's everything from this haul video
let me know what your favorite bits are
and I'm really hoping that it gets even
more sunnier I'm really looking forward
to the summer I hope you guys enjoy
everyday May so there'll be a new vlog
every single day at 6:30 p.m. and
another main video next Sunday so I will
see you tomorrow
