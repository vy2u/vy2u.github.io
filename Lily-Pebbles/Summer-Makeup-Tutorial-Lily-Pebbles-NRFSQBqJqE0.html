I'm gonna be showing you my current
spring makeup look which is this look
I'm wearing now I would this look in my
spring style guide video so you might
have seen it already but for today's
video I'm gonna talk you through all the
products I use to get this look and what
I think of them so let's start with the
base and for this I'm using the Trish
McEvoy Beauty booster cream now this is
very expensive it's a proper treat but
it's really really good I wouldn't
mention it if I didn't think it was
amazing it's a primer and mask mixed so
it feels really moisturizing it feels
like you're putting on a moisturizing
mask but then it also works as a primer
as well I love this I go into my
bathroom in the morning and do my
morning skincare routine and then when I
come back into our gym to do my makeup
this is the first thing I apply and it's
made my skin feel amazing it's just a
lovely first step for my makeup routine
I then start with my foundation and for
this I'm using the Charlotte Tilbury
light wonder and this is quite a new one
for me but I've completely fallen in
love with it are you shade three fair
and this is a really nice light
enhancing foundation so I'd say it's
light to medium coverage depending on
how much you build up but it's
definitely very dewy and light spring
summery foundation I use my fingers to
apply it I found that much better than a
brush and it's really like nourishing
and moisturizing it feels amazing on the
skin it feels almost like a skin care
product and the finish you're left with
it's just really brightening light
enhancing and I think it looks beautiful
on the skin so I just blend that all
over and make sure it blend down into my
neck and get it all in I think it takes
a little bit longer with your fingers
but you get a really nice natural finish
then onto concealer and I'm gonna be
using my NARS radiant creamy concealer
in vanilla and this is my favorite I've
spoken about it loads before it's really
handy because it has a doe foot
applicator so you can just pop it under
your eyes and then for this tutorial I'm
going to be using my fingers to blend it
in because it is more of a spring summer
look I like it to have more of a natural
finish and although it takes a lot
longer to kind of Pat it in with your
fingers because of the warmth within
your finger it does blend a lot kind of
more natural and has a much more natural
finish so I'm just patting that in and
then with what's left under my finger
I'm going to use that on my lids to use
as a primer for when I do my eye shadow
I'm also popping this on my chin around
my nose and in
my head or I have a little bit of a spot
as you can see the shade it's a little
bit light for me at the moment but
custards a little bit too dark so what I
do is I end up just blending this with a
brush and then once I put bronzer on it
kind of looks alright
for my bronzer I'm gonna be using this
new one from Topshop which is their
illuminator called reflect and it's
really pretty because it's kind of
shimmery but not at all glittery so it
leaves that really nice kind of summer
glow sometimes a bronze as a tomb matte
I find them just a bit too much for the
summer so this is the perfect in-between
it's not orangey at all it just adds a
really nice kind of bronzy glow to your
cheekbones and I kind of do it in a
three from my temples to my cheekbones
down to my chin and a little bit all
over just to give a nice even tan
now onto blusher and I know you guys
probably think I do my makeup in a weird
order but this is just how we do it I'm
going to be using the Kiko blusher in
Ipanema peach which is part of their new
summer collection and this is so so
pretty it's kind of got ready undertones
so it looks really natural because when
you flush you kind of flush red or most
people do so it looks really natural on
me but it's very pigmented so you only
need a tiny amount I put it just on the
kind of apples of my cheeks slightly
higher because this is a slightly
highlighting and I think it looks really
pretty okay so before I start my eyes I
like to frame them with my brows and I
don't need to do much to my brows as you
can see they're quite dark and full
already
but I like to use the hourglass brow
sculpting pencil in dark brunette and I
use one end to just brush my brows i
brush them upwards because that's kind
of how they naturally go and then using
the other end which has a really nice
waxy formula I just fill in the front
parts of my brows because that's all I
really need and really gently do little
kind of swipes of color and it just
makes them look a little bit more even
after doing that I'll use my clear blink
brow gel just to set them in place and
keep them there for the rest of the day
okay so now under the eyes and I'm going
to be using one of my Mac palettes which
looks like this let me know if you would
like me to do a video on my Mac palettes
and my favorite looks and I will get
that done for you guys but for this look
I'm going to using two shadows the first
one is patina which is the best eye
shadow it's a really nice light golden
and I feel like this goes with every
sort of lip if I'm not sure what sort of
lip I'm gonna do or if it's quite a bold
lip
this is the perfect shadow it's a really
nice light golden beige so I just put
that all over the lid
blend it out and then just to define it
a little bit more I'm gonna be using
charcoal Brown which is a nice kind of
light matte Brown just in the crease
really lightly not too much product and
then I also take that underneath the eye
just because I like wearing eye shadow
under the eye I feel like it balances
things out of it even though this is a
summer look and dark brown eyeliners
probably not suitable I love wearing
kind of a brown smokey eye all the time
so I'm gonna be easy Mac teddy which is
one of my all-time favorite eyeliners
it's a really nice deep dark brown it's
really easy to blend and it just I find
it really flattering I'm not sure why so
I like to just put that on the top lid
just kind of a simple line across the
upper lash line I seem to have run out
of all my drugstore mascaras so today
I'm going to be using YSL babydoll which
is probably one of my favorite high-end
mascaras it's really easy to use I feel
like I don't need to apply too much it
just really curls and lengthens and
volumizing my lashes kind of all in one
and it stays wet it doesn't dry out so
this is a really nice mascara it also
has a really nice kind of pointed one so
you can really get into the corners for
my lips today I am doing pink and pink
is in the color I wear that often on my
lips but for spring/summer I really like
it and I think it looks really pretty
for my lipstick I'm gonna be using Mac
blustering and I absolutely love this it
goes really nice with gold eyeshadow
which is why I chose patina and it's
really creamy and easy to apply because
it's not matte you don't have to spend
ages kind of with a lip liner or a lip
brush you just apply it it's really
creamy and it's got really nice it's a
really nice like Reddy pink it's
slightly red so I find it easier to wear
then like blue tone Pink's on top of
that I'm gonna be using the Maybelline
Color sensational shine gloss in 150
pink shock and this just adds a little
bit of like a pink pop with a slight
kind of glossy finish and at the moment
I'm really into layering lip glosses
over lipsticks it's just really kind of
nice thing to do and it means that you
can just layer the lip gloss all day and
the lipstick should stay a bit better so
that's my current spring makeup look I
hope you guys enjoyed seeing how I do it
and me talking through the products let
me know what your current favorite
spring makeup product is I'm really into
spring looks at the moment I just love
when the weather gets sunnier it makes
me so happy
I hope you guys are having a really good
week thank you so much for watching and
I'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
