favorite nail polishes for summer first
of all sorry for any background noise
it's like the hottest day of the year
today so I've got all my windows open
and it seems that all my neighbors and
mowing their lawn today which is just
typical but I've got ten nail polishes
here they're all kind of fun summery
colors that I know I'm going to be
wearing a lot for some first one is the
Rose babydoll nail polish I think this
came out as part of their baby doll
collection and I've never really tried a
why sell nail polish before it's not a
place I'd go straight to for nail polish
and it's got one of those lids that
comes off and then there's another lid
inside which makes it a little bit hard
to hold the brush but the brush is
really nice and wide on these you
literally need like one swipe and you've
done the whole nail and the colors
really opaque as well I was really
impressed with the quality of this nail
polish and it's just a really unique
color it kind of reminds me of SE
watermelon but I haven't got that one so
I'm not sure if it's exactly the same
but it's just a nice kind of raspberry
pink and really pretty and I think it's
quite chic and growing up you can wear
it to like a web Dean or to an evening
party as well as kind of during the day
the next one is topshop Venus flytrap
and this is a little bit different it's
kind of like a pastel green I think it
can look a little bit sickly depending
on your skin tone but if some reason it
works on mine and I really like it i
think it's really kind of different
summary i've done a blog post on this as
well and i love topshop nail polishes
the brush isn't as wide as I'd like it
to be but I think the quality of the
polish is really good and they last for
a long time and they just have a really
good color selection the next polish is
nails inc portobello and this is part of
their neon collection but i don't
actually think it's that neon if you
weren't white underneath then it can be
really neon but if you are on its own
it's kind of just like a juicy orange
shade and it's really pretty and the
reason I like it is because you can wear
it so many different ways you can wear
on its own quite sheer you can layer up
so it's like quite a nice orange or you
can wear it over white or nude and then
it's kind of a neon orange as well it's
just really pretty and I do love a good
orange but this isn't like a ready
orange like some of the other ones I own
it's like a true juicy orange which is
where I really like it the next one's
from Bordeaux and i love the border on
nail polishes especially the one second
gel ones i just think they're so good
they last for ages of my nail and they
have a really nice and wide brush so you
hardly need any effort to apply it the
first one is turquoise block and i just
love this it's a
little bit different to most turquoise
I've seen it's not very blue it's not
very green it's kind of in the middle
and it's a little bit with darker shade
as well so I find it a little bit more
grown up but I love my blue nail
polishes as i'm sure you guys know and
yeah i really recommend borscht or i
think they're really good quality and
it's just a really kind of nice
different turquoise color if you want
something a bit brighter more fun and
girly then i really like this one from
sinful colors and i think the color is
24 7 i'm not really sure it's a bit
confusing these are really really cheap
being it from boots i think they're like
199 the quality isn't as good because
they also cheap and it has a matte
finish which is a bit funny but if you
just use a nice top coat then you'll get
a nice shiny finish I just think the
colors amazing it's literally a neon
bright pink and it's really fun for the
summer and even though I'm not that
girly when it comes to my nails I do
like a good meal and this was really
good after about two or three coats
another border 1 and this is called blue
no blues and this is a lighter turquoise
compared to turquoise block is basically
just like a baby blue but it's really
pretty and as I said I love blues and
this is just really easy one to use the
brush is really wide as i said so
they're easy to apply and it's just a
really pretty kind of summary blue i
think next one is SE full steam ahead
and this isn't a tiny Wincy bottle
because it came in the little mini-set
they did for their summer collection
that I bought and this is pretty much
like se lilac ism but it's got this kind
of pretty shimmer running through which
I just think is really nice for the
summer cuz it captures in the light
every now and again it's not glittery it
anyway it's just like a slight shimmer
and I do have a good lie look I had to
put a lie liquor than theirs and they're
really pretty on the nails they look
really kind of elegant and chic
definitely like a wedding color I think
lilac ism I always wear to weddings and
kind of smart events like that I think
it's really pretty in the summer and
yeah these little bottles are really
cute i definitely recommend checking out
their mini collection because i don't
think i never really finished a nail
polish so it's nice to have a mini one
another border or water pollicis is the
last i seriously love those gel polishes
this one is called green fizz and its a
bright green I absolutely love this I
did a post on my blog comparing this to
one of the SE nail polishes from their
resort collection because they're really
similar but i actually prefer this one
it's kind of like a bright green but not
neon is just so pretty this is my
favorite out of the three balls ones
i've mentioned in this video definitely
recommend going and checking out if you
like bright green nail polish
is this one is just so fun and so pretty
i really like it if all of this is a bit
bright and crazy for you and you like
something a little bit more neutral and
chic then i definitely recommend the
barry m gelly enlight G this is just a
really pretty neutral beige color Miller
of these barium jelly nail polishes are
so good you hardly need two coats they
come on really thick and they dry and
last for ages I'm really impressed with
this range I have like most the colors i
really like lights either i just find it
really classy and easy to wear and it's
nice for those days where you're not
sure what you're going to wear so you
want your nails to match this will match
everything finally I had to add in a
mint because you guys know I love my
mint you can see from my wall behind me
and the while I'm liking it in the
moment is Maybelline mint for life I do
still love se mint candy apple but this
one is really good and the brush is
better than the SU what I think that I
know they're both kind of wide but this
one's really good I don't know what it
is about the formula of this nail polish
but I've just completely fallen in love
with this the perfect mint I was wearing
it in my last video and yet it says
super stay for 7 days I don't think I
ever have the same nail polish on for
seven days but it probably would last
because this one does last ages of my
nails I think mint is perfect for the
summer and actually all year round it's
just my favorite nail color and with all
of these I always use my seche vite
topcoat to finish them off because it's
a really nice thick top coat just makes
the color last it makes them look really
shiny stops any chipping and it's my
favorite top coat by far so I hope you
enjoyed seeing all my favorite summer
nail polishes let me know if any of
these your favorites as well if you have
any different favorites let me know what
they are because I'm obsessed with nail
polishes and I love having
recommendations thanks for watching I
hope you guys are having a nice summer
so far and i'll see you in my next video

whole video but i'm going to be doing it
slightly different to my usual ones I've
actually used all these products for the
