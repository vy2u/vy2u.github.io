appreciate how much I love this t-shirt
so today I'm gonna be talking about
tanning it's coming up to that time of
year where we all want a bit of
sunkissed glow
I am completely against sun beds so if
you want to talk about some beds go
elsewhere I also don't think line in the
Sun is that great for you and if you
watch my protect my skin video you'll
know why so I've been trying to get more
into fake tan recently I used to hate it
I used to hate it because you'd always
see those girls who are already in jihad
patches around their wrists that I
thought I do not want to look like that
but I actually think if you invest in a
good one do your research and learn how
to tan properly you can get a nice
subtle tan if you're looking for an
expert on tanning don't watch this video
go elsewhere I'm definitely no expert as
I said I've only started doing it
recently and I'm still learning about it
all but if you are a complete kind of no
tan have no idea about it then we can
just discuss it together we can have no
clues together so first so I'm going to
talk about exfoliating the first thing I
do no matter what kind of tan I'm using
is exfoliate the skin you need to get
off all the rough dry skin because I'll
always the town will just cling to it
and that's why it goes patchy or streaky
as I mentioned in another video I love
using exfoliating gloves it makes the
whole thing a lot easier you just pop
them on and then you can use your hand
to exfoliate and they're quite harsh but
they don't hurt but it really do get for
all the dry skin I also really like the
Rimmel Sun shimmer preet an exfoliator
and this is a product made specifically
to exfoliate your skin before tanning so
it's really great it's very kind of
gritty really exfoliates the skin and
even when I'm not tanning I like to use
this on my legs before shaving because
it really kind of like makes it easier
to grip all the hairs so this is the
exfoliator I would recommend before
tanning and then let's start with
instant tans so not the kind of times
you hear about where you have to apply
it and wait for it to get darker and
sleep on it or wash it off these are the
ones you slap on and it gives you a bit
of color these sort of towns are really
good if you have an evening event or
something where you're wearing maybe a
short skirt or a dress and you want your
legs to look a little bit tanned and the
two I would recommend are that this
works perfect legs skin miracle and the
chordally divine legs they're kind of a
bit different let's talk about chordally
first this one has been spoken about a
lot because it does
your legs look really glamorous this is
sort of thing you'd wear if you're going
to an award ceremony or a party it's
slightly shimmery so you will have that
kind of glistening look to your legs
which will make them look really healthy
but some people don't like that kind of
look
this definitely isn't one for traveling
with us in a ridiculous glass bottle but
it has a nice easy pump and with this
kind of thing I just put up my hands
apply it on my legs and wash my hands
you don't get any marks on your hands or
anything it's really easy to blend
there's nothing more to it than put on
your hands blend down your legs and
you're done this one has a really nice
kind of golden finish nothing orange
nothing too subtle it's just a really
good one the perfect leg skin miracle is
very similar but this was more of like a
serum so this one says a powerful serum
with vitamin C to perfect repair and
enhance this one really makes her legs
look very healthy and nourished and
moisturized as well it has a really nice
tan color I think although this works
products it's just I really like the tan
it's definitely not orange it's kind of
somewhere in the middle it looks really
natural just like you've been on the
beach for a few hours this one would be
my favorite out of the tube but this one
isn't shimmery so they are slightly
different I also have a mini size of
this that I always take away with me and
I just think this is one of those make
your legs look good color products so
now let's talk about proper tans I guess
that's not what they're called but you
know what I mean the traditional type of
real tanning get naked prep your body do
all of that kind of stuff
something to note is I always apply tan
with a tiny mitt so that looks like this
let me take it out for you they're
really cheap they're like one pound or
two pounds and you pop your hand inside
like that it means that you can just put
the product on and it will not streak or
go patchy it's much better than using
your hands it means you don't have you
tiny hands when you're done and it's
really easy to use there are two tans
that I use that I found to be the least
kind of scary of all the tans and I've
never had any problems with them the
first one is Zen turn dark lotion
absolute Lux which was introduced to me
by Anna Riviera does makeup because she
has used this for years comes in a giant
tube the one thing about this is it is
quite expensive I think a lot of tans
are quite expensive but you can get a
slightly cheaper online on fill uni so
this is a lotion what I do is I shower
exfoliate make sure my skin is
completely dry and then apply the lotion
with a mitt
the only thing about this
you kind of have to wait for it to dry
so if you're doing an evening and you go
to bed you will get down on your sheets
on your pajamas but if you wait for it
to dry I don't really have many problems
with it it has a slight scent I think
all tan products have a slight biscuity
said this one isn't that bad and it
leaves you with a really nice kind of
greeny olivey tone tan which is a sort
of town that really suits me it says
it's ultra dark so I was really worried
I was in Phoenix phoning Ana saying are
you sure it's ultra dark
she said yes cuz and it's quite pale and
she said this does not go that dark on
me so I went for it and she was right
it's not that dark it's just like a nice
noticeable tan it's nothing crazy
definitely not orange I also feel like
this really moisturizes the skin and my
body always feels really nice and soft
after I use this the other time I've
been using is one I mentioned in my
monthly favorites so I won't talk about
it too much because I spoke about it
then if you want to see the video I'll
link it below it's the San Tropez self
tan express this is slightly different
it's a mousse so it applies kind of
similar mousse lotion not much
difference really you just kind of whack
it on although I find with the mousse it
dries quicker as you go with the lotion
you can kind of keep blending but this
one dries quite quickly after two to
three hours depending on how dark you
want your turn you wash all the product
off and then you're good to go the time
will keep kind of developing throughout
the day this how also has a really nice
kind of natural tan color it's not as
green or olive toned as the Zen tan but
it leaves a really nice kind of bonzi
nice tan this one's more convenient if
you just want to kind of tan and go
because say you have a couple of hours
in the morning put this on have a shower
and you're good to go where's this one
you kind of have to let the product dry
so those are the two times that I've got
on but best with and I really like them
both I would definitely recommend them
for the few days after utan it's really
important to keep your skin moisturized
if it starts to dry out I think things
go a little bit patchy around your
ankles your knees your elbows so the
town I use is the Vaseline spray and go
I have that aloe fresh one this is just
so easy because it's like an aerosol and
you can just spray it straight on your
body so it's very quick because I find
moisturizing my body it's so boring so
this is good for those of you who also
if I know boring when it comes to
tanning my face I don't use these kind
of tans I don't know why I think it just
scares me that it's gonna go too dark
because I don't have to change or my
makeup and foundation if I go too
so the products that I use that work
really well for me at the Clarins liquid
bronze self-tanning product and this I
just used on custom oil all over my face
in the evening and the next morning when
I wake up I'll just have a slight tan
it's nothing too drastic you have to
change your foundation it just takes the
edge off if you're feeling a little bit
pale and I just love this I'm like
nearly finished it I think it's down to
there and I use this all the time if you
want more of an instant like pick-me-up
morning bronze that you just put under
your makeup the this works perfect look
skin miracle so this is like the same
one to go with this for the legs
you just put a couple of pumps of this
and it's like a bronzy gel and you can
use it as a base under your makeup and
it just kind of lifts things adds a bit
of kind of bronzy color and takes the
edge off if you're feeling very pale so
finally let's talk traditional makeup
bronzers I have three favorites you guys
are going to know them all because I
talk about them all the time first one
is NARS Laguna look at this I've pretty
much finished that I need to buy another
one this is a great bronzer is slightly
orange e so if you're very pale this
might not be one for you but if you're
my kind of color or dark it's a great
bronzer it's it's not completely matte
but it's definitely not shimmery so you
can use it for contouring or and
all-over glow and it's just looks so
nice on if you did want something that I
really like the body shop honey bronzer
and this is in shade - I think it's
matte i hundred percent no but it's
definitely not very shimmery it's a
really nice bronzer there's a shade one
as well which is slightly lighter so
it's good if you have very pale skin but
even Shea - isn't very dark it's a
really half soft bronzer I don't know if
that makes sense but I feel like when I
apply it it makes my makeup look very
like soft focus
and finally soap &amp;amp; Glory is solar powder
which I use all the time there is a
massive dent in this one it's fit down
the middle so there's a slightly darker
matte bronze and then a slightly lighter
shimmery one and I just swirl the brush
all together and it's just a really nice
summery bronze it's definitely not too
shimmery it's not kind of to oranjee is
kind of quite a sheath toned and I
absolutely love this bronzer so those
are all the tanning products that I love
and hopefully this helped you if you are
kind of just getting into tanning and
you want some recommendations it's
actually a question I get asked a lot by
my friends and family I think with
tanning products they are quite
intimidating and you want to have a
personal
recommendation rather than just picking
one off the shelf because going orange
and patchy is not cool so comment below
and let me know what your favorite
tanning products are in case I want to
find some more and hopefully this helped
you I will see you guys in my next video
