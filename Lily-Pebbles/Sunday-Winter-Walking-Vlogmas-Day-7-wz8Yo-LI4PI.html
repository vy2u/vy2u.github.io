the morning after had such a nice time
last night and it's kind of yes half one
sorry bit of a slacker today but this
morning rich cleared up the whole house
he was pretty amazing actually did a
really good job while I said SATs and
edited yesterday's vlog because normally
I kind of do it as the day go so we're
doing the afternoon I didn't do anything
yesterday any editing so this morning I
had to edit the whole thing and it was
18 minute long vlog I hope you guys
don't mind the long ones normally my
weekly vlogs are 10 minutes and that's
three days says I have an 18 minute vlog
for one day is a bit crazy for me but it
was a really nice fun watching it back
it's just so I really enjoyed it I think
I think it hopefully went down well it
would have been up by now so we need to
give Dixie a good walk so we're gonna go
take her for a long walk now and then I
need to pop to space and Kay to get some
bits and we'll probably grab some lunch
at some point and I don't know not that
much interesting stuff is going on today
but it is some day and rich actually has
two days off he has to take some holiday
days before the end of the year so he's
taken tomorrow and my birthday off which
should be nice I've got a couple of
videos and needs to film tomorrow though
so I'm gonna try and get him to help me
with those and then Tuesday we'll we
should have some more birthday
celebrations oh yeah so going for a walk
now it should be nice and refreshing I
got my wellies on aces got Israelis on
rich has Israelis on let's do this
it's freezing cold but I have a hot
chocolate so I'm happy
I think Dixie needs a little winter coat
but said pushes that Tibetan Terrier she
has like what she's like Eastern Tibet
right yeah from snow Ridge a so she
should be good in cold weather this
isn't it coach delicious she did you
sneeze
by the way I was reading some of my
comments in my video today and in a lot
of my videos you guys always say like
what lipstick you wearing what coat you
wearing and I try to link as much as I
can in the description box and normally
says if you haven't got a link to the
product it has like what is what
lipstick I'm wearing if it's something
like bright and bold if I'm wearing a
new jacket or something so always check
the description box cuz there's a lot of
stuff that down there do you have a nice
time last night you struggling in speech
yeah my birthday and I said oh god are
there really 27 counties on there and
then rich red yes and they're gold and
white cuz he knew the theme I mean got
golden white hands right thoughts well I
didn't Wayne you but when you get that
cake today
how'd you know that me noticing I was
with you all day oh yeah where did you
hide it
wow I'm really it's hard to surprise me
I'm not I'm not surprised but I was nice
parrot what yeah right that's a my cry
oh my god there's a pair of keys lying
around or you definitely can't see them
but then bright green parkies parakeet
Paki I know you know what the word is
needy died she ate their plastic and
have an operation and she got really ill
after that and for months she kept like
not eating for days and getting really
skinny and just like sleeping all the
time sure to have loads of operations
and now she's like it's a normal it's
great just like 13 years old she's doing
very well rich just popped into Planet
or garlic I got the things I needed from
space and K but I can't show you because
it's a Christmas present did you get me
- my favorite coconut water especially
when you're little bit hungover because
it's seriously rehydrating you came home
in my onesie before I get too comfy
though before I get too comfy I'm gonna
wash my makeup brushes because it's been
quite a long time actually I'm supposed
to do it every Sunday that was my rule
and by half Pete's lucky recently and
some of these are pretty dirty so I'm
gonna wash them to do that I use the dr.
Bronner magic soap and this is in the
baby mild so it's like unscented you
can't get him in like almond scent and
mint actually I've nearly finished this
but you only need like a small amount
you put it I like to put it in my hand
and then I switch the brush around my
hand and then rinse it all out making
sure you gotta keep your brush facing
down you basically don't want any water
to get there because then it will loosen
the hairs and that's when they starts
biting mold so always keep it down don't
like drench it just kind of use the
water and then I lay it flat on towels
hanging off the side of the table so
that if it's rounded like this it
doesn't get like a flat edge so I'm
gonna get on with that now I've got
quite a lot to do here
I wash your face brushes everything so
I'm gonna do that I always get sore
and then I'm gonna go to sit downstairs
and relax
okay Russia's worst and they're probably
gonna stay here overnight to dry I'm
going to sit watch X Factor and eat what
are these teen heart trips without a bit
spicy meat run on X Factor catch-up time
getting pizza oh yeah also gonna do my
nails I'm gonna use the Chanel base coat
and then this color which is wire cell
beige gallery which I love just for like
clean nails Seche vite top coat I'm
gonna put bit oil on my nails are dry
this is from OPI and my cotton ball and
now push me over there
pizza's here we're being very naughty we
don't actually normally get Domino's I
think it's really expensive for what it
is but it's so easy and you can pay on
card so we just thought spoil ourselves
in a Sunday night tada
rich got like a meaty feast and I got
pepperoni and veg and mushroom mmm
also by the way this sauce is by far the
best viewers get an extra one it's
amazing
I think I'm gonna end my vlog here I
know we haven't done much today we just
went for a walk and then I washed my
brushes and painted my nails but this is
the end of the day and I'm just gonna
sit and watch the I'm a celebrity get me
out of here final who do I want to win
Jake on drink to win and that's about it
so I'm gonna end this here it's been a
short one but I hope you guys have liked
it anyway
