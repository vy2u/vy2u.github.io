gonna have to like get used to
remembering what day it is
well I've woken up with a bit of a sore
throat you know and you feel like you've
got tennis ball in your throat I'm
hoping that will go away I've already
had that had that last week I just
remembered though as I was unpacking my
stuff that I didn't show you some of the
stuff I got from Oliver boners I also
got these kind of bowls so these I
thought would be really nice to put nuts
in and this is kind of a salad bowl but
then you don't really get it that wet so
I might use it for crisps but I also
bought these like salad tongs so I guess
you can use up like a dry salad but
anyway I'm really into the whole copper
thing at the moment so I thought that
would go with the theme today I think
it's gonna be a home day I have got lots
of work to do and a lot of you I said in
my vlog day 1 would you do for work I
have mentioned it like in quite a lot of
detail in past videos maybe my youtube
tips video or something like that
I do blog and YouTube full-time and I've
been doing it for a couple years now I
post every day on my blog and I normally
do three videos a week but at the moment
I'm doing a video every single day as
you guys know and I do lots of work with
brands and lots of other stuff it's a
strange new kind of job so there's lots
involved it's really hard to explain
anyway I love my job but in these vlogs
you probably won't see like my real
working day-to-day life because
obviously I knew that I had to film
every day and edit and upload every
single day this month so my blog posts
I've kind of pre written a lot and
scheduled them I'm not doing three main
videos a week I'm just doing one on
Sunday so that I can kind of work in the
mornings and then do fun stuff in the
afternoon because I can't vlog myself
working all day that would be so boring
so the moment I'm scheduled up till
Sunday today is Wednesday so today I've
got to basically schedule next week's
blog posts I think I've got quite a few
of the photos done I just need to write
them up make sure they go up
automatically and I might film some
videos as well because unlike a normal
job like I think in my old job I used to
get time off between Christmas and yeah
I've still got to produce these blog
posts and videos and I've got quite a
few videos going up over that kind of
New Year's area there's like 2014
favorites and new year's get ready with
me or like a New Year's makeup tutorial
so I might try and
film those kind of earlier on because
all my family and friends would be off
work during that time so probably won't
want to be filming so I'm just uploading
vlogmas day two I finished editing it
I've just uploaded I'm just making a
thumbnail and then I need to check my
emails because I haven't checked them
since yesterday morning
this is the system I use in my notepad
for scheduling blog posts so every
little tick list and these down for
photos text links scheduled Facebook
tweets so it's like the process I go
through when I'm scheduling writing you
know planning a blog post and so all of
these should be checked really but this
is Friday so I've got a lot of work to
do I'm also currently working on a
little redesign for my blog for the new
year so that should be exciting there's
a few things I want to change and switch
off about that design so I'm just going
through and putting in all the details
my blog I realized that on day one I
didn't put all the details of things
that I'm wearing and stuff so I'm gonna
do that for a day - its 11:30 and I
haven't got anything to eat yet so I
need to go find something
don't and I serve come round and
remember I told you I went to get the
salmon for my birthday this is what's
happening to it
all right now she's not sure what's
happening to it pour liquid up it's
curing things like three days all that
liquid comes off so they've returning
into gravlax which means you put it
loads of salt
yeah salt and sugar and a bit low Jim on
this one don't have to do anything else
to it
just drain it every day and then we can
put herbs on top last night if you want
they see you have any yummy lunch yeah
oh my god what is that hmm
I'm just gonna write out a little
thank-you card and I got these from Kate
Spade they have all different initials
on them so obviously got L it's in cold
and then it's polka dot on the back and
the envelope that comes with it has
stripes on the inside it's so cute I
love these safe all right send thank-you
cards just unwrapping everything and
this bloody sticker is driving me insane
you know if it stickers on that just
won't come off it's completely gonna
ruin the cup that has really annoyed me
why don't they just put it in the bottom
that would have made so much more sense
I always watch youtube videos whilst I
do my makeup so there's probably some
good vlogmas videos up I'm gonna have a
look and see which ones to watch just on
the hunt for some plastic cutlery plates
and cups for Saturday night so trying to
find this little shop no luck on the
cutlery front so we're off to see my
grandma and I'll have to find the
country another time ace is gonna go
feed the guinea pig you gonna show me
where the guinea pig
outside okay
Jeff your shoelace we go she put it
through the bars
I'll show you how and then you can do
okay right there to get one piece you
hold here you'll nibble it what's the
guinea pig called you want to give him
away

through the bars
please asking for money what is really
squeaky oh you try it's five to four now
I got back it like to maybe cotton um
burp it was really nice to see my
grandma and chat with her and hang out
with my nephew I'm just trying to get
through my emails I really really want
to clear my inbox today I'm just gonna
tackle those now here's a little sneak
peek for Sunday's video it's give me a
15 under 15 pounds video and I'm just
filling in the description box here
because I basically have to put links to
all the products I mentioned so it
listed them all here and I'm gonna add
the links now and schedule that so it
goes up on some day okay so now I've
scheduled the video and put in all the
info I'm now writing the blog post to go
along with it and then I will schedule
that yeah I'm gonna pop the supermarket
so I'm just making a list of things I
need because I haven't got any of the
stuff I need for my birthday yeah I keep
trying to get it and then not so I'm
just making a list here I need some jugs
and cutlery and plates I need some
batteries because my trackpads
dying and then I'm gonna write the
ingredients for the drinks and the food
that I'm making and hit the supermarket
so this is one of the salads I'm gonna
make for Saturday night it's a red
quinoa with toasted pine nuts and
pomegranate so that'll be nice and then
I'm also making a courgette asparagus
one where's that this is a Salang geez
which one is this just the first one uh
here is char grilled asparagus project
and Minori
no that is and that's cheese we're not
gonna put the cheese in that looks
really yummy so I'm just gonna write
down all the things that I need and then
go shopping
I have three supermarkets on my list but
they all have different things that I
need so let's go a little kind of
supermarket run first out Waitrose
these were not on the list but I saw
them and wanted a hot chocolate
now to Aldi because they do really good
and cheap wine I was looking for the
pine nuts and I accidentally asked the
man and waitress excuse me where he or
not and then I realized what I said and
I went bright red and it was the most
awkward thing that's ever happened to me
in a supermarket I basically ran away
from the nut Department it's where I'm
making lists is the only way to shop I
think I pretty much got everything so I
feel very organized now perfect I mean
just as I'm driving home rich calls me
to say he's nearly at the station so I'm
gonna pick him up someone just tweeted
me to say that my blog must stay -
thumbnails says vlogmas day one so
haven't got off to a great start
um I'm just gonna try and redo that now
this is one home for dinner tonight
burger chick potato salad boys all in
the other room watching football so me
and my mom I've gotta watch it link
early something else you need to know
about me I have an unhealthy addiction
to Hollyoaks it's really sad I used to
watch it back in the day and then I had
years of not watching it and now I'm
back into it it's really good
all right I'm making hot chocolate and
I'm being a nice girlfriend and making
some for rich even then he doesn't know
we didn't have enough milk to make it
completely from milk so I'm using the
coffee milk frother to top it up at the
top it's literally spinning like crazy
oh the light's gone off it seemed that
means it's ready so getting hot
okay frothy milk done I'm also gonna put
in these which I bought earlier no
should've got some of the honeycomb
damnit YUM look how good they look I'm
gonna go and embarrass rich into the
boys football room taking him a pink
fluffy marshmallow hot chocolate I just
took the hot chocolate into rich and he
actually said nothing he just accepted
the cup and carried on looking at his
phone I was no you're welcome you
ungrateful potato yeah so I'm gonna end
this vlog here and I need to edit now
