one of every day May so I'm going to be
vlogging every single day this month I'm
gonna be uploading Monday to Friday but
I'll vlog every day if that makes sense
in Monday's vlog will be Friday and the
weekend and then choose this vlog will
be Monday Wednesdays vlog will be
Tuesday etc and I would still be doing a
main video on Sundays the reason I
didn't warn you guys of this is because
I hadn't really decided for sure until
about yesterday whether I was gonna do
it or not because it is a massive
commitment it's really scary I if I'm
gonna do something I'm gonna do it
properly so committing to vlogging every
single day is pretty scary when I still
have to keep my blog going and
everything else but I'm gonna try my
hardest to make it good for you guys and
so many of you have requested it since
vlogmas so I thought why not let's just
do it in May because I thought the name
everyday May that's pretty much why so
today is the first look and then I'll
have a main video on some day and then
the vlogs will start again on Monday
here's what to expect from everyday May
some entertaining days some very boring
days at home because I know I'm vlogging
every day I have kind of not organized
more things to do but being more open to
saying yes to things and not staying at
home all the time so I'm gonna be out
about a bit more than I would in other
months so today I haven't got the most
entertaining day I've got a couple of
meetings this morning and then I'm gonna
work at my agents office the rest of the
day so that I don't have to come home in
between and they've got a little desk
for me there I like to work there cuz I
I really miss worth working in an office
environment I've had like bloods of
normal office jaws before and I love
that sort of environments and I working
from home by myself
I still kind of struggle with that so
whenever I can I go and work in the
office it's just really nice to interact
with other humans and I actually get
more work done when there's no he's
around me the word was sunny it's been
raining like yesterday poured of the
rain actually I didn't tell you about
yesterday I wanted to yesterday I went
for breakfast with Bobby Brown pull my
arm is hurting as any day one I went for
breakfast with Bobby Brown like the
actual Bobby Brown makeup artist Bobby
Brown so I'm on my way to meet Bobby
breakfast is pouring the great like so
excited to do this father she gave us a
whole presentation and talked us through
her life story and it was really really
inspirational what an amazing lady I had
a really really lovely time and then I
went to the hairdresser I go to hirtius
ins in Harvey Nichols in London and you
like my hair I've just curled it myself
so it's looking a bit funny but I just
got a little bit cut off the ends and I
got the colour put in again
I have Katherine for the cut she is the
coolest lady ever and Jason for the
colour who is so great they just both I
feel like there's a real technique I
used to get my hair cut and colored and
I just felt like they were just putting
on but he really has a technique he does
balayage there's very subtle light bits
Ali they're both they're just like the
dream team I've found my dream team so I
love them this is what I'm wearing today
excuse the mess behind I'm pretty much
wearing the same thing I've been wearing
all the time recently my contact list
this monkey vest which I'm obsessed with
this is a shirt from Topshop my years
ago my whistles Charles is and I'm gonna
buy my Topshop shoes as well and I'm
taking this handbag which is full of
laptops and notepads they're far too
heavy for the bag and a little makeup
bag so I can touch up my makeup tonight
I still have the old iPhones or
something I can't leave the house
without is my portable charger because
my battery dies within like an hour
I'm at Liverpool Street Station which by
the way has one of the best boots
they've got a Burberry pants episode of
boots or Street Station meeting done we
were just talking my how old put it is
the whole like one kiss to kiss thing
and sometimes you hit their nose and you
do two kisses which is mega awkward I'm
just heading back to the game office to
sit and do some work
we're heading out to get some lunch
before Anna's doing like this an alive
thing on the Selfridges website and I
really want to watch so I'm going to get
it from language so I have my mic you
want a MIDI to live tutorial which is
sounds so scary I'm excited for her

cards I think just it's a really cool
show that I like for Benny continue

brain in the car I was just like oh good

smack of some kind and at this point no
one knows yet no one knows until this
video is up it's like secret Thursday

popcorn that quinoa mango thing and an
apple and elderflower
fizzy drink thing okay we're now heading

chocolate one show you that only
unhealthy one in the book is the meal

healthy but not too healthy like still
quite filling a nice though
I'm home now and I had such a lovely
evening at the detox kitchen we had such
a delicious meal and our bure driver was
hilarious
we literally got in the car and he
starts blasting Backstreet Boys and
singing along and he had this like
personal playlist that he wanted to play
and play it really loudly and it was
kind of hilarious we were singing along
and I put it on snapchat because I'm
trying to get into snapchat these days

so I'm home now and had a great day
highlight of the day was definitely the
uber driver and his hilarious playlist
