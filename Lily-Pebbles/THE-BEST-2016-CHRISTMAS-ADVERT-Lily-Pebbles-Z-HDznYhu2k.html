little bit different but every time I do
any kind of Q&amp;amp;A session for YouTube and
blogging and stuff and whenever I get
asked questions about my advice I always
say talk about something or write about
something that you're passionate about
because then your passion will show
through and you'll always enjoy what
you're doing so today's video I'm
practicing what I preach I'm talking
about something that I love and then I'm
interested in I know that this isn't
interesting to everyone but it's
something that I really enjoy and that I
feel really passionate about so I wanted
to make a video talking about my
favorite and least favorite Christmas
adverts this year as most of you know I
studied advertising at uni marketing and
advertising has always been something
that I'm really interested in and really
passionate about so whenever Christmas
comes around
I love engaging in discussions online
about Christmas adverts and I feel like
this year amongst the people that I
follow on Twitter I was one of the first
to say that I didn't like the John Lewis
advert I feel like whenever that one
comes out there's always so much
discussion around it and everyone's
always very positive and I usually am
but this year I wasn't and it kind of
sparked a lot of debate on my social
media platforms and I loved it I just
love discussing it whether it was on
snapchat Twitter everyone has different
opinions and it's so fine and it's so
great so for today's video I'm gonna
talk through some of this year's
Christmas adverts few things to note I'm
obviously not covering them all there
are loads these are just the ones I
think are worth discussing another thing
as these are all UK ads so if you
haven't seen them I'm gonna link all the
adverts below
I can't insert the videos for copyright
purposes so what I'm gonna do is in
between each advert I would suggest
pausing this video going to click the
link below in the description box
watching the advert before I start
discussing it because I'll always it
won't really make sense to you so if
anyone that wants to keep watching
please stay tuned let's discuss some
Christmas ads I'm gonna do them in order
of how I watched them so the first
Christmas ad to always come out is the
John Lewis one and it's always so so
hyped up because they do incredible
adverts they do storytelling very well I
absolutely loved the penguin one from a
couple years ago and one last year about
man on the moon was my absolute favorite
I thought they got the song so write the
story right it was partnered with Age UK
and it really kind of got to your heart
and I feel like the point of a Christmas
ad is to make you feel something and I
don't think it always has to be happy I
don't think it always has to be sad
it just has to make you feel something
so when the John Lewis ad came out
everyone was very excited it's just
become a thing in the UK to get very
excited about the John Lewis ad yeah I'm
gonna quickly watch the ad to refresh my
memory if you want to do the same go
click on the link below so the advert
starts and the dog is watching his owner
a young girl jumping up and down on her
bed so so cute I think it was really
nice that they picked a dog is like the
main character and the little girl's
very sweet I've watched the behind the
scenes for this ad and that whole house
and garden with it was a set that they
made it's absolutely incredible I love
the way they don't know shoot that adds
like the coloring and the softness of
the light is always really really nice
so that happens then the girl goes to
bed and you see her dad in the garden
building the trampoline I know there's
been a lot of debate about I can't
believe John Lewis showed the dad making
the prison I don't know I don't wanna
discuss it on here in case anyone young
is watching it could have been a present
from her parents I'm not really bothered
by that part dad makes this amazing
trampoline in the garden and then when
everyone was asleep you see a fox come
out now I know that this advert is
partnered with a wildlife charity so it
makes sense
the Fox gets up on the trampoline and
music starts a badger and a squirrel
join the Foxes on the trampoline they're
jumping up and down and the dog is
staring longingly out of his lounge door
desperately wanting to join them on the
trampoline it was this point I wasn't
really a bit confused because the music
that they chose to use for the ad I felt
was completely wrong I felt like the
pace was wrong these animals were
jumping on the trampoline and now having
a best time ever and it was this like
really slow sad song and like I just I
felt like the speed of the jumping and
the speed of the song it it really like
didn't work for me and the anticipation
in the music made me feel like I was
waiting for something like crazy to
happen I didn't think it was very clever
how they reenacted that Anna was jumping
on the tram
they clearly look at kids and sort of
body movements they make and I think
when the Badger kind of lands on his
bomb it really does look like he's
jumping on the trampoline they're like
CGI and stuff was incredible
so then Christmas morning comes and the
little girl runs outside and she sees
this amazing trampoline and she's like
in shock she starts running towards it
and her dog overtakes her and runs on
the trampoline kind of cute like I feel
like you could kind of see that coming
and again the CGI of the dog jumping is
amazing but then if it was happiness
that john-louis were trying to get out
of this ad surely the girl would like
join her dog on the trampoline but
instead she stares at her dog looking
pretty pissed off and then the ad just
ends and I didn't get it at all
like compared to the previous years
where the story was so great I felt like
this story didn't go anywhere and
nothing happened it's basically a story
of a dog that desperately wanted to get
on a trampoline I just think they
shouldn't have tried to do happiness
because we didn't mind when that adverts
were sad like last year because it
wasn't sad last year it ended happy you
know he sent the man on the moon in this
gift and it was it was like emotional
and lovely and kind
whereas this ended a bit of like a sour
Cheers dog you just ruined my Christmas
by stealing my trampoline I felt like it
was a bit flat I really didn't think the
music went with it and I was very
disappointed I would love to know what
you guys think so we're gonna move on to
the next add the next one I saw is the
M&amp;amp;S Christmas advert Marks and Spencers
very British brand I don't know if this
is correct or not but I feel like
normally MNS just do Christmas ads where
they have all their like celebrity
ambassadors kind of glancing around
Christmas parties wearing pretty dresses
but this year they gave storytelling a
go and I'm gonna quickly watch it now to
refresh my memory
it starts off in like a snowy house with
reindeer outside it's quite clear
straight away that it's Santa Claus is
house and it's so Christmassy and lovely
and you get to take a peek inside which
is pretty exciting you don't normally
see what it's like inside Santa's house
it looks like a normal kind of
cozy house clearly like husband and wife
lived there and mrs. Claus is there we
don't normally get to hear about mrs.
Claus so as a female loving this already
she's kind of getting Santa ready for
his big night out she's giving him a hot
water bottle she said like don't need
too many mince pies it's kind of like a
normal husband wife situation but it's
Santa and mrs. Claus which is like epic
they get some post through the door and
Santa asked are there any last-minute
requests such as I know it's just bills
and then Santa heads off for his annual
duties and mrs. Claus is left at home by
the way mrs. Claus is looking great she
waved him off she says be safe it's very
cute like giving her a little kiss
goodbye
she says they forget Australia it's just
like cute little like moments with Santa
and his wife I'm loving it by this point
and then she heads back into our house
and she opens up a letter the music
starts and it's like the perfect kind of
if there's anticipation and it's kind of
sweet little twinkly music we see that
she's been written and notes by a little
boy I love how they have the boy reading
the letter out loud he's got a very
sweet kind of young boy voice in the
letter he's kind of introducing himself
and talking about his family and how he
has a sister and I think that's a great
story because most of us a lot of us
have brothers or sisters and can relate
to these little stories of you know when
your sibling gets annoyed with you for
doing something one point the dog eats
her shoe and she's distraught and oh my
god the amount of time my dog is like
eaten things that I've been like dad
it's so fast it happens he's like very
normal family situations and you can
instantly relate with them and then he
asks for something for his sister and
mrs. Claus like get straight to it this
is her time to shine and she like it's
ready and it's amazing like red Power
Suit she goes into this like special
vault where she has all these presents I
mean this is like power to females
loving it and she gets unlike this like
ice what they could like I got me what
they're called those things you like
ride around the ice and you get to like
see her coming out of her like the North
Pole or wherever she is and she gets in
a helicopter it's like modern-day mrs.
Claus she doesn't just sit at home and
wait for Santa Claus to do everything
she
like getting on this important task she
gets a helicopter over to the little
boy's house she like goes in the front
door she puts the present by the chimney
she takes her mince pie and estimates
pies are the best so I can see why she's
enjoying that so much and then she heads
back to her helicopter the boy wakes up
on Christmas Day it looks like he's in
London it's snowing that's the only
annoying thing about this advert it
never snows in London on Christmas it
always snows in like February so I wish
Christmas ads would stop making it snow
but he wakes up Christmas Day and they
all like will family they're opening
presents in the morning so Christmassy
and cosy and lovely and the sister gets
a present saying to whatever a name is
Jake wanted you to have this love from
mrs. Claus and she's like what this she
opens it and it's like this amazing new
pair of trainers red sparkly to replace
the ones that were eaten by the dog she
gets all emotional and hugs her brother
he says in the letter you may think I
don't love my sister but I do and I
wanted to be happy I love her very much
and they have a really cute moment and I
think it's so nice so many people can
relate to it it's so heartwarming and
cute mrs. Claus heads back to her home
and when Santa gets back she pretends
she's been asleep all night he's like
how is your evening she's like same old
not much and it's a brilliant of a
secret life of mrs. Claus very like
female empowering so so good I think
that's my top favorite Christmas ad from
this year
well done ms okay next one is
Sainsbury's I'm not aware of previous
Sainsbury's Christmas adverts it's not
wasn't really on my radar of like ads to
look out for but it came on one night I
think I was watching TV when it first
aired and it was like the really long
version normally they haven't have a
really long version of a Christmas ad
and then they have shorter versions as
well by the end of it I was a bit like
no don't think I like this one and the
more I've seen it the more I'm beginning
to dislike it more and more every time
I'm gonna watch it now to refresh my
memory go click on the link below for
the Sainsbury's Christmas ad okay so it
starts off with a house and you can tell
pretty much straight away this is gonna
be a cartoon ad which I personally don't
love as much and feel like you can't
relate to cartoons as much especially
this is the kind of Wallace &amp;amp; Gromit
type like plain Dale cartoons I don't
know what the official
and then some singing starts and it's
like a musical ad okay I like musicals
beating hi tell straight away it's James
Corden singing now I love James Corden I
think he's very funny I think he's great
I think the singing thing is getting a
bit much like yeah you can sing but he's
not the best singer ever and he sings a
lot and I was a bit like if I'm honest
like I roll James Corden's singing in
the Christmas side but okay let's see
where this goes so it's about this dad
and he's very busy and he's in his
family home and he's kind of rushing to
work and the lyrics in the song are all
about like being very busy it's kind of
cute like he works in a toy factory the
lyrics is all about how busy it is a
Christmas and he needs to buy Christmas
presents he hasn't got any time and
there's a queue for the queue and when
he accuses old lady taking ages to pay
at the front and it's kind of cutesy I
thought okay is kind of sweet let's see
where this is going
he starts singing about what he wants to
do is spend time with his family he
doesn't know how people do it how do
they do it all how do they see their
family how do they work and how to bake
my presents and then he comes up with
this genius idea decides he should make
clones of himself in his toy factory but
he doesn't actually make clones of
himself he makes like little dolls and
little nodding dogs and then he thinks
about how he could be at home with his
family while these other versions of him
are doing his work but they're not
really because they're just toys so it's
kind of like okay I get the idea but
it's not actually real but I guess it's
a Christmas ad so it's not real anyway I
did see some funny tweets from like
people who work at Sainsbury's he said
it's funny how the ads all about being
at home with your family but I've been
put on the Christmas even boxing day
shift
whoops so yeah he's finally at home with
his family and then he gets to the end
of the ad and they all still stick
around the table and they all join in
singing and it the cheese factor gets
like really amped up and it just builds
and builds until it comes to the end and
I really like the message the message is
all about how it's not about what you're
buying people it's just about spending
quality time with your friends and
family which I am all for so yeah
message of the ad is great but execution
it's not the worst Christmas and this
year but that song really starts to
grate on you like I'm walking around the
flat singing it and I
it's driving me mad I think the song is
really cheesy and I'm not a massive fan
of the cartoon style it's like it's an
okay ad I just really can't hear that
song ever again
like when it's oh and I fast forward it
okay if I not add I want to talk about
is for Heathrow Airport I haven't yet
seen this one on TV
but I've seen it online and yeah quickly
go have a watch of the link below and
then come back and we can chat about it
so the advert starts and you see a plane
and then you see the air stewardess kind
of wake up these two teddy bears like a
man teddy bear and a woman teddy bear
and they clearly like the last on the
plane because they fell asleep and so
straight away I'm like this is kind of
weird because it's not a cartoon it's
like a real-life thing but with teddy
bears that are moving and they're really
cute teddy bears as well they kind of
remind me of teddy bear my mum had
growing up I could look like a really
old-fashioned teddy bear like with the
arms and legs kind of move separately so
the teddy bears
mr. and mrs. teddy bear get off the
plane and the music starts and it's like
really cute
old kind of like English I did have to
describe it like pinky ponky like very
very like old London I don't know how to
describe it but I loved the music it
just works so well with the teddy bears
oh they're so cute the songs all about
I'm going home so clearly mr. and mrs.
teddy bear are heading home for
Christmas even though their teddy bears
the little movements they make are so
like human the way they hold hands and
the way they look at each other like the
way they stop and mr. teddy bear like
takes his hat off really cute little
movements that make them feel really
real and you don't really know why at
this point but you're really like
relating to these teddy bears and you
have like real emotions towards them
also I feel like an airport is a very
emotional place anyway
so just to see these two little cute
teddy bears walking through the airport
is very sweet I absolutely love the bit
where the guy checks the photo in the
passport and mr. teddy bears like in his
holiday Hawaiian shirt they go through
passport security they just look like
they're walking so slowly through the
airport like airports feel huge anyway
but when you're a tiny teddy bear they
feel you
more huge mr. Teddy bear-like puts his
glasses on so we can see where the
baggage collection is and you can like
see how his eyesight's better ones but
his glasses on and then miss the teddy
bear goes the toilet while mrs. teddy
bear awaits
normally for us it's the other way
around like me and my mom always have to
go to the toilet before we get our
luggage and like rich and my dad are
always waiting for us I love that they
put that in because I feel like that's
when everyone goes to the toilet just
before they get their luggage and then
they go to get their luggage but they
can't quite get it off the conveyor belt
so someone helps them which is really
nice I just love how like mrs. teddy
bear has her cute little hat and her
coat and then they walk out to where
everyone's kind of waiting for arrivals
and at this point I'm like oh god I
really hope someone's there to meet the
teddy bears like what's gonna happen I
just don't know the anticipation is
killing me and then mr. teddy bear like
nudges mrs. teddy bear and like goes
that light look over there and then you
see these two kids like run up towards
them like they're so excited to see them
and as it pans back to the teddy bears
they're actually grandpa and grandma
they're like humans like grandparents
and it was so nice and I really didn't
expect that to happen and it just
completely warmed my heart like who
doesn't love grandparents and oh I
literally the first time I watched it I
watched it like five times straight away
because I just wanted to see it again
it's so so sweet I really hope that
Heathrow sell those teddy bears I don't
know if they are but I would 100 then
buy like I think I'd buy both I don't
know who's my favorite I think the
grandma is my favorite but it's just so
cute it's such a brilliant ad it just
does everything it's supposed to do it
ties in like traveling during Christmas
and coming home and it's warm and it's
lovely and it makes you feel good and
there aren't any pissed-off girls
angry at their dog for jumping on the
trampoline so that is my summary of the
2016 Christmas adverts I really enjoyed
making this video let me know what you
think because I mean this is very
different for me but it's been really
fun and let me know if you'd already
seen all those ads or if you're outside
the UK what'd you guys think of them as
well I love discussing this kind of
thing so the more comments the better
