Anna we are on a press trip with West
Elm West Elm just like one of our
favorite brands ever so it's so excited
to be on a trip with them and we've
pretty much been traveling all day we
left this morning and at like half 7:00
in the morning the flight was actually
fine with food virgin it was really nice
I wasn't scared
we like chatted the whole way then when
we landed we had like a lot of time on
the tarmac it took ages and getting
through customs took ages so we just got
here and we feel pretty gross but I just
changed clothes
I've got no makeup on but we're saying
in the one hotel and the one on Brooklyn
Bridge which is the new one and it's
packed I feel like I just said one loads
of times it's amazing we are in a suite
this room is unreal I feel like I can't
even explain to you guys I've just seen
something really cool I just want to
live here I want this to be my flat the
view is insane
Anna's going to come to my room in a
minute because we are both so hungry we
haven't eaten all day we want to go get
pizza I'm not going to put any makeup on
or anything but until she comes I might
quickly give you guys a quick room tour
when you walk into the room this is what
you see there's like a living area
furniture is all incredible
massive massive windows look at that
view of New York of Manhattan oh my go
it's beautiful and the water I've never
I've never seen anything like it it's
incredible so then when you come round
here there's some really nice wardrobe I
just want everything desk huge bed and
then also an amazing mirror I love this
is all the bathroom in here so it's like
behind glass and there's like some fancy
Delap light system so you open up this
glass door and you have all this stuff
over here is mazing shower in there
toilet in there and then look at this
beautiful marble with really really cool
taps is giving me so much like so
inspiration and they take so many photos
also mirror with a little magnifying
mirror definitely want that in my house
so that's the incredible room that we're
staying in also is fully prepared to be
sharing a room with Anna so connected we
have our
rooms because then we'd actually all
could about pooing we're pretty good
with Gerry rooms but I have my own like
place to prove to you know throw enough
also just seen over here there's like
you look like water you get your own
fresh water triple filtered water I get
in hotels very like eco-friendly I think
that's what it's all about we ventured
out very quickly I still feel a bit
gross we're going to go get some pizza
we're currently esterases are so hungry
and we discovered that there's garlic
granules on the table we're taking them
on our plate this is the color group
really all over these books between
detainee 83 Daleks are not oh my god
guys here look at it it's like ratio for
your face mirror oh my god oh my god
very closer okay I need to go anything I
think we've decided to take these please
like scratch our room just so we can
enjoy them when we got a second wave of
hunger we put extra your look on their
becoming feel like we need here but this
is the outside of the hotel it's
incredible they pumped if I smell
through the hotel how you can buy the
candle and it's incredible workers like
how the subway pump out smell it because
it's not like some ways or like
oh it smells so good select our main
lobby is
good morning everyone it's Tuesday I
woke up pretty early it's the jetlag but
I kind of love it it makes me feel like
a morning person
this view is just unreal I feel so lucky
to be in this room it's the most
incredible hotel it have stayed in by
far so I got up I got dressed I'm
wearing this Topshop dress which I'll
show you what I'm standing up I just
done my hair and makeup and it eight
o'clock so I think I'm going to do a
little bit of work because obviously
we're behind so I'm going to have quite
a few emails to catch up on and then I'm
going to head to Anna's room I reckon
we'll grab some breakfast and today is a
West Elm day today we're going to be
getting a preview of their holiday
collection which is Christmas it's
always they're finally doing Christmas
stuff in the summer but because it's
like a press preview they do it like six
months ahead of time so we're going to
go to their headquarters their head
office which is right here in the area
is called Dumbo which i think is like
the equivalent of like Shoreditch in
London it's a very cool area in Brooklyn
so we're going to have a look around the
area we're going to go to their office
which I think will be incredible we'll
get a little preview of the collection
and I think tonight also doing a dinner
with Western but there's a bit of a gap
in between what we might like look
around the area or get some work done
only get a nice Instagram photo as well
so I'm excited for proper day one New
York thank you we're in the little deli
from the bottom floor of the hotel and
for this avocado in total it's really
good actually we've got orange juice and
arnica amazing and yogurt two things I
thought it was you
people like a pill you got a disease an
aneroid the philosophy this more names

hard

top-off of my Nivea lip balm and this
detangler looks pretty good but I've got

one thing this morning I was like no
specific losartan although I'm very
tempted by a cinnamon face where the
viewers of makeup goddess one of my
favorite things to do when I have to
America is basically live around these
markets essentially like a healthy one I
always end up getting rich like peanut
butter or something and get this quite
near our hotel we go with you
yesterday I'm getting some dry roasted
and unsalted almonds some like what they
called like peas their bases in a peas
player their families and also I'm
getting all these these like pretzel
