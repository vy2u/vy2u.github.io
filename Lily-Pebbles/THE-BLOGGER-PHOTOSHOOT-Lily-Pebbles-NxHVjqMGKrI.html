the first time smoking today I wanted to
vlog today because I'm doing something
pretty cool but first of all I'm writing
Anna's birthday card because I'm seeing
her today and it's her birthday tomorrow
and so I thought I'd give her her
present which is rather large it's like
this big but it's really lightweight
she's getting the train home I feel
really bad I did ask her like is it okay
I think she was originally gonna drive
and now she's taking the train I think
I'll give it to her and I'll say like if
you don't want to carry this home it's
fine I can give it to you another time
Benny I'm writing her card I got her
this one it has this really cool photo
of my illustration of two girls and it
says we only travel to steal the tiny
bottles from hotels and it reminded me a
bus so truth we particularly like the
cotton pads we always steal those from
hotels so I'm just gonna write her
birthday card done so today I'm doing a
photo shoot this is why Anna's coming
down especially for the day to London
the shoot was for a girl called Lauren
or lolli as everyone calls her she runs
the blog girl stole London and you may
have seen her talk online
she runs a kind of campaign I guess
called girl versus cancer she got
diagnosed with breast cancer and blogs
about going through treatment and the
ups and downs and everything that's
involved with actually having breast
cancer she's an amazing girl and she's
very supportive within the blogging
community and we've spoken a bit online
I've never actually met her before so
she very kindly asked me to be involved
with her new campaign so she has these
t-shirts you might have seen they're
amazing that I white t-shirt and then in
big black text across the boobs they're
different words to describe boobs
basically like knockers mammaries and
she did a load of photos first time
around she's actually made some new
t-shirts added a load new to new ones to
the collection and she's getting some of
her favorite bloggers to model them
there was a shoot month ago that I
couldn't make we're like friends like
Harry
and rheem were involved and then there's
another one today I don't know who else
is gonna be their partner but I'm really
excited to catch up with everyone and
maybe meet some new people so it's a
real honor to be involved in it and I
can't wait she told us to bring our
favorite red lipstick bit worried cuz my
lips are quite sore but I'm gonna eat
some breakfast and then put this on and
hopefully it will stay put this is the
Charlotte Tilbury red carpet red and
yeah that's all I'm going to go and have
some breakfast because I need to pick up
a knife in the station at 10:30 I need
to swing by my parents house on the way
to the shoot to pick up a suitcase so I
can keep all my suitcases there and pack
for Italy on the weekend and then we're
gonna go I'm actually eating breakfast
today because I made some Bircher muesli
at the beginning of the week I've been
having it every day I've actually got a
recipe for this on my blog you'll be
typing Lily Purple's virgin muesli there
is a recipe I basically just pour
porridge oats in a bowl cover it in milk
overnight to let them soak and then in
the morning I put like half a tub of
yogurt plain yogurt in and some maple
syrup and then I cut up some apples you
can put raisins and stuff in but I just
like it with apples and then it's done
for a whole week it looks gross but it's
YUM I'm loving my t-shirts today this is
what I bought from Suzanne in New York I
really loved that shop I definitely
recommend taking a visit if you're in
New York I also just wanted to say thank
you guys so much for your comments on my
home day vlog it was a bit of a sad one
I'm not fully recovered from my weird
like negative sad patch but but today I
feel okay I had a really like successful
meeting yesterday that made me feel
better but I've got loads of comments
from you guys saying that you quite
enjoyed that I just opened up and I was
quite real because it made you feel
better about feeling in the same way and
I got quite a few lovely emails from
people so I'm glad I could help in some
way I really didn't mean to do that but
that's cool also the videos that Anna
and I did together went down so well I
knew they would because when I was
editing my video I literally didn't
quite know entertain and it was so
enjoyable to edit and watch so I knew
you guys would like it too and we really
enjoyed filming them I swear if we lived
closer we would do videos together more
often normally and all come to London
and I'll just meet her in town and we
never like go to each other's houses or
anything but we'll try and make an
effort to do more together because we
both really enjoyed filming them editing
them and
and read in the comments it's just
really nice to have a video that you
guys enjoy so much okay I need to eat
faster I'm gonna go okay that's the
Charlotte Tilbury red carpet rent
done feels a little bit drying because
my lips so sore but I think they'll be
okay I've just thrown on my denim jacket
and actually I really like this
combination of denim jacket the white 80
t-shirt with the red I know the red lip
when I pick up Anna from the station and
then we're gonna head to the shoot
location okay I'm just waiting for Anna
at the station that's her president let
me show you how huge is I mean it's
pretty big I have to say I'll see what
she wants to do I think if she opens it
she'll be able to carry it easier I
guess I can say what it is because by
the time this video goes up it would
have been her birthday and as the
hardest person to buy for just like hell
my friends say I'm the hardest to buy
for because we're very lucky we get sent
a lot of nice stuff and if I bought I
know what I think she wants I would have
bought her a 300 pound cashmere jumper
but don't spend 300 pounds on your
friend's birthday so it's really hard to
find something within budget I think she
would like and she doesn't like faff she
doesn't like to have things just for the
sake of having them she's very
minimalist so she's very difficult and
sometimes I'll just like take her out
for lunch a decent a nice like that but
the time is don't really work this year
cuz I'm going away and stuff anyway I
went to my favorite shop Hagen in Camden
Passage it used to be cooled oh I can't
remember they changed their name anyway
I think it's good Hagen now and I bought
her a wicker basket which sounds really
weird but it's a really nice one they
thought she could put like in the corner
of her bedroom and put throws in it or
use it for a dirty washing or she could
put it in her office and keep products
that she's been sent in there there's
quite a few options I thought she can
use it kind of how she wants but it's a
really nice one it's not really
something I think she would buy for
herself so I really hope she loves their
fingers crossed I'm at my mom's I picked
up Anna look who's here he's trying to
go to sleep you guys haven't seen him
since he was born and is here going

routine okay I know where my bathroom to
prop you up on um I've already cleanse
my skin yeah I'm gonna leave it because
I already cleansed earlier this is so
uncomfortable
I already cleansed with my Oscar
Renaissance cleansing gel I've been
using this a lot recently instead of my
glossy a milky journey cleanser which I
still love but because the weather got
colder this is like a little bit heavier
and my skin's really been enjoying it I
was gonna do a face mask but I'm not
going to but I would highly recommend
this I bought this in New York is that a
violet sea radiance mask and it's bright
purple it's amazing and I would if I
could be bothered but I'm having a bit
of a lazy day I'm just gonna use the
glossy a super balance because I love
this is a hydrating serum even though I
run about out of it all the time and
then I'm going to use my doctor yard
saerom it in and then he finished this
one but I've got backup love this
moisturizer I've got some like steroid
cream and I'm gonna put my lips because
they are so soft and this is the stuff I
use when they're when they're not
feeling right okay I'm just gonna brush
my teeth and then head to bed so we hope
