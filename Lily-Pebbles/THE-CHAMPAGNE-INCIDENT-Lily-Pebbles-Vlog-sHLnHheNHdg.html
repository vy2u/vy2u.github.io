Wednesday I thought I would vlog today
and maybe tomorrow I know a lot of you
said that you miss my more like weekly
vlogs as I said I just haven't had that
many days to vlog but I think this week
I could probably vlog today and tomorrow
I've just been getting ready this
morning and straightening my hair and
stuff and doing my makeup I'm now
heading into town I'm actually going to
meet Carrie from the blog wish wish wish
I've read her blog for absolutely years
I will link it down below it's like the
most beautiful fashion blog ever but
she's also the most down-to-earth cool
girl and she's really into her food so I
feel like we're really gonna get on we
haven't met before definitely we just
haven't met up just us too so I'm making
her take me to the place called melt
room because I've seen her talk about it
before and it looks insane it's like
toasted sandwiches with mac and cheese
in it oh my god it sounds absolutely
incredible also you guys know I've just
got into calligraphy and she's
incredible at calligraphy and I know
that she's got an iPad Pro and she uses
a special pen and I'm so intrigued I
wanted to tell me all about it and then
finally enough I already had that kind
of lunch with her planned but then after
lunch I've got a tutorial at the Apple
store to learn about the iPad pro so
that'd be really cool I'm just intrigued
to see what it's like I did used to have
an iPad and I never really used it but I
feel like with the whole pen thing I
might use it more and I can kind of draw
on pictures and photos and maybe
practice my calligraphy skills I don't
know Berrien treats I'm going to ask
Carrie what she thinks and then I'm also
going to go to the Apple store and learn
more about it so let me show you what
I'm wearing today this nail polish
actually is nails ink Regents place
regions place on Regent Street you guys
have been messaging me about it
and this top is from cause it just looks
like a plain gray sweater on the front
but it's like got this little shirt
detail the butt I mentioned it in my
whole video these jeans are old and
they're from Topshop and they are far
too big for me so I have to wear this
belt like really tight around my waist
and the bag is saline and my Nike
trainers which are really not white
anymore if any of you guys I'm going to
just close in while I talk any of you
guys know how to make trainers why again
I'm so gutted they just don't look as
nice because they just look Robbie so
that is really annoying I really want to
make these white again but how lame is
zooming in and out on cameras it wise
you've like old school that when my dad
used to film my birthday parties anyway
I'm going to
to the tube now heading to the Meltz
room which is on Knoll Street in Soho
oh my voice is still gone from my hand
that's how loud I was singing I'm
wearing Becca champagne pop in the
liquid formula today and because it's
liquid it does kind of go all over your
face more than the others but it looks
very pretty and glowy I really like it
and I'm wearing a liquid blush
everything is very Julie today and I'm
enjoying it I haven't had any breakfast
but I know we're going to be eating a
lot so I've just got big thing of matzah
and peanut butter to take with me on the
journey I'm just quickly popping into
night town because I really need some
new trainers from the gym I get really
bad shin splints so I need some more
like supportive trainers
these are the first ones I'm going to
try on I basically need trainers with a
bit more soul I've got really flat feet
so I get shin splints and my calves are
also really really tight so I'm gonna
try on some more supportive trainers for
the journal these feel a bit clunky for
the gym so I'm now trying on these
railings which feel much lighter they've
still got that good sole right then I'm
gonna get these they're really
comfortable and very lightweight and I
kind of like the funky colors I'm really
happy I got this trainers I'm now
heading to be Kerry and I fill up an
appetizer I'm getting a lot of mac and
cheese
this is my mac and cheese toastie oh my
god I was so good and I got side up and
just had too much delicious mac and
cheese sandwich that I didn't manage to
finish I knew I would be able to do so
yummy as you don't know where we are now
Jim yard
timbi of Timmy on 470 Capri
Carrie there and she's gonna show me her
Medusa iPad pro I gotta help fancy you
look with yellow pen this looks so cool
look at Carrie do a hello ha very
impressive
pretty nice oh my god know what I'm
gonna end up getting one of these and
I'm just not going to be able to write
hello parties just come and a tea comes
with trimers so once that's done we have
to take the tea out of the teapot and
then it like perfectly brewed we unity
could be so complicated I just had such
a nice couple of hours of Carrie she's
so so sweet it's just really nice me up
with someone and chaste and really nice
so now I'm going to Apple store because
I'm going to have a tutorial with new
iPad pro at
to learn about it I already want one
carries convinced me I know I'm going to
get it so I just went to the Apple head
office which was really cool and I've
been in there before and I had a
tutorial all about the iPad pro and it
was so fascinating I learned so much I
really think it can do so much with what
I do and like annotating photos and do
more with like calligraphy stuff and
really excited about it I haven't been
this excited about like a tech thing in
a long time so yeah and it comes like a
keyboard when I get it I will show you
guys but I think I'm going over the
smaller one just so I can use it for
emails and stuff when I'm out and about
but that was so interesting I'm just in
Topshop quickly trying on a few things
and I really like this dress but there's
a massive design flaw this is the
dresses from the boutique range you see
that looks like I'm wearing like really
bad because is actually the pocket it's
like bunching up inside yeah and it's
really nice this panel is quite sheer on
them I really like it I try like this as
well I've got a summer party at the end
of tomorrow what's our party tomorrow
and have nothing to wear I like this
could also work for summer wedding and
I've gone okay I am home now and I had a
really nice day out I just can't get
over how excited I am about the iPad
pros seriously seriously excited about
that and I thought I would show you the
things that I bought I shaved the
trainer's close-up and then I bought a
couple of dresses from Topshop as well
quite spontaneously actually I really
quickly just tried them on but I've got
this summer party tomorrow that I wanted
a dress for and then there was another
dress I really liked that I thought I
could just wear like an everyday thing
when it's kind of hot but I don't want
to be like have my legs out you know
like all my legs out and you I'll show
you okay these are the trainers
I love how Knight do half sizes so I got
a six and a half they fit perfectly as I
said I've got flat feet and I get shin
splints but I don't really do much
running I do mainly gym stuff with a
little bit of running sometimes to warm
up so the girl recommended like a few
styles for me the ones that have like a
thicker sole some of them are a bit too
heavy these are really lightweight so
they give for the gym because I do lots
of like jumping around burpees and stuff
so I like light feeling trainers but I
want them to be supportive as well and I
just thought I always go for plain black
so I'm gonna get something a bit
different and funky and I really like
these they are definitely gonna clash
with my sweaty Betty leggings but I
think they're cool I don't know what
they're called there were 130
which is not cheap but I think it's good
to invest in trainers especially when
you're working out you don't really
hurting yourself actually maybe it will
have the name here the lunar repec low I
think that's what they could okay so
these are the dresses I got from Topshop
they asked me if I want to keep the
hangers I always say yes because I
always need extra hangers so this is the
one I bought for the summer party
tomorrow it's made out of that funny
light material I'm not sure if I love it
it's like it looks like it's like
creased all the time it's kind of
stretchy it definitely like clings to my
thighs and my hips but I just don't know
if I care because it's really
comfortable to wear right let me stand
up so I can show you so it's got these
thin straps and then a bit of lace like
cold shoulder cutout detail and then
slightly longer sleeves but they're
still short it's this black and white
monochrome print then it goes down and
it's got a little tie to go around the
waist I like to tie quite high up
because that's more flattering on me so
that's that dress I like that I can just
kind of scrunch it because it won't
crease and then this one is I don't know
it's one of those ones it probably isn't
flattering but it's really comfortable
and I think it could be cool I actually
tried it on with trainers and thought it
looked really cool it's striped oh no
there's makeup on it I hate that luckily
that's the inside maybe it's my makeup
so it's striped quite big stripes
short-sleeved and then God it's really
hard to show you actually it's got a tie
that goes around the waist and then big
pockets and it's really long with a bit
of a slit but it's kind of loose and I
don't know got a look cool I look quite
nice on so I just got that as well those
are the two things I got from Topshop
it's much later now I just do watching
tutorials on YouTube about iPad probably
actually aren't that many because I
think the small one only came out in
March the big one came out in November
there's not that many people do much
tourism stuff so I'm hoping if I get
good at it maybe I could do some or
something like that I'm just so excited
by it I can't wait so there's so much
you can do on it it's crazy I'm actually
just looking at the hotel I'm going to
tomorrow it's the gleam summer party and
so everyone from the UK office and the
American office they're flying over
we're getting together for a big summer
party and I can't wait to see everyone
and get together me and Anne are sharing
a room going to Clifton house
I'm just looking it looks incredible
I'll vlog tomorrow as well but we were
driving there myself which would be a
bit lonely but means I could sing in the
car
so Jake's here now we just got takeaway

phone the takeaway place to check if
they're not in the food Jake's like
severely allergic to nuts he's like it's
