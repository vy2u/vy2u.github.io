I wanted a vlog as much as I can this
week because it's a very exciting week
as I'm sure you know my book is out this
Thursday the 8th of March this video
will be going out a few days later on
Sunday and it's gonna be an absolutely
crazy week and it all kind of kicked off
yesterday I didn't vlog because I had no
idea but my family held me a surprise
party which I was I had absolutely no
idea I almost went around to my mom's in
my tracks bottoms in which was like oh
they're a bit Gracie she changed I was
like oh yeah they are I went round and
like loads of my family and a few
friends were there and they decorated it
and they were like balloons it said the
F word and a massive giant like blown-up
version of the cover of the book and I
felt really overwhelmed we don't even
really do things like that in my family
so it was really nice my mum just can't
stop saying how proud she is of me and
it's a really lovely exciting time I
feel like I've really achieved something
and I know I've been talking a lot about
the book on my youtube channel and
Twitter and stuff but like made possibly
a once-in-a-lifetime thing and it was so
much work that went into it so I can't
believe March 8th has finally come
around it felt like such a long way away
when we first decided on this date I
can't believe it's actually here so I'm
gonna be getting up to lots of cool
stuff this week I'm gonna be vlogging as
much as I can today I am sending the
book out to bloggers quite a lot of
bloggers and we're doing some like gift
boxes I obviously wish I could do that
for absolutely everyone but we had like
a limited amount based on like the
products that are in the box so we're
doing a few gift boxes and then I'm
sending the actual book out to as many
people as I possibly could people who
have been kind of part of my life
blogging journey and who I think would
really like the book so I'm gonna be
going into Hodder to do that
I'm gonna take them in some cupcakes I
think just say thanks to the marketing
and PR team at hada and then this
afternoon I'm hosting my own radio show
on Magic chills you guys know I
mentioned them in my February favorites
video and they actually got in touch to
say we love Lily was so happy she
mentioned us would she like to come in
and host her own show which is mega
exciting very scary I'm finding like the
for the book really quite terrifying but
I feel like this one would be cool like
I like magic child I get to pick my own
songs and I'm gonna do like a little
throwback session so I don't know when
that's gonna be up because it's a pre
record but if you follow me on Twitter
I'm sure I'll share on there also while
I've got you and a lot of the events
that I'm doing for the book I'm
announcing on Instagram stories because
if these videos are pre filled and I
don't get the chance to mention them in
there but there's an event happening in
Birmingham at my old University
Birmingham City uni that you guys can
come to pretty sure it's free and it's
gonna be kind of more of a in
conversation with type of thing all the
events I'm doing are quite different so
I'll put information down below on that
if you're from Birmingham and then I'm
also gonna be announcing some more space
and K events another one in London I
think one in Leeds Bristol Glasgow I'm
not really sure I can't remember but
I'll put everything I know now in the
description box if not follow me on
Instagram especially Instagram stories
because that's where I will be
announcing the events I'm pretty sure
the London one sold out so quickly so I
think for the second London one they're
gonna be taking the next people who
emailed so it's fair okay I need to go
have some breakfast because I am hungry
I need to fuel up for the day ahead I'm
very excited for this week okay I'm in
haja and I'm gonna be signing all of
these books for my favorite blogger
friends let's do this
here's what this room is looking like
right now so we're packing up these
boxes we've got books cards photos
there's lots of elements I'll show you
once I've done one fully here's example
of one of the boxes is actually
Caroline's box I've got one for you one
for a friend so two books a little card
with a picture of us this mug is from
Oliver bonus I love it a little mini
travel jo Malone blackberry and Baek
handle my favorite scent too glossy a
lip balms one for you one for a friend
and then these postcards and which I
actually had made so they say all
different things and that we kind of
made up together you're the moniker to
my Rachel you're the best thing about my
job sisters the opinion you didn't ask
for I lied to you I never liked him and
you're engaged don't ask me to plan the
hen so that's what it looks like I hope
everyone really likes it
so we've packed up all the blogger boxes
and send them all out all the books and
thank you so much all the browsers that
helped out with that paper chase Jo
Malone
Oliver bonus glossier was it yeah thank
you to those guys we're now on our way
to Magic chills I'm gonna be doing a
little session with them so if it hasn't
gone up by the time this video is gone
up I'll let you know but if not I'm sure
it'll be online somewhere
I'm here with Louie we're gonna do a
quick interview and play some good tunes
okay I'm home the interview on magic
childers really cool it was super quick
actually because it's like a
pre-recorded thing but if thing that's
gonna sound really cool it's like edited
all together so that's actually gonna be
up on Wednesday night if you want to
tune in and have a listen and hear what
my top picks were best and really good
throwback songs in there not gonna lie
it was so fun packing up all the boxes
the bloggers today I can't wait to see
them all receiving them and that's all
for today
I will check back in with you guys
tomorrow folks sorry guys just checking
in it's Tuesday night and my friend
Deb's came over tonight for dinner and
we actually did an Instagram live on my
Instagram and I was meant to vlog it but
I completely forgot buzz meant to vlog
every day today and I just forgot to
look so it's now choosing I am taking my
makeup off as you can see and I'm gonna
wash my hair because it's so greasy and
tomorrow night is my space and clay
event it's my first book event I'm doing
like quite a range of different events
because it's really difficult I want to
see as many of you as possible but then
I also want it to be a nice experience
so any event that I'm hosting that I've
organised I'm trying to make them as
small as I can so I can actually talk to
everyone but a lot of the events which
I'm not hosting I've kind of been
invited to they're gonna be really big
so it might be a little bit more kind of
casual and less kind of personal but I'm
always torn between like meeting as many
people as possible versus making it a
really like nice and durable experience
where you guys get to chat to me and
I've learned from the past that 25
people is kind of my limit me and Anna
did 50 our LOX tournament
that it was two of us and we're very
tired afterwards so I'm doing like a
range of different events so hopefully
you guys can like join in and the first
one is tomorrow - facing claim so I'm
very much looking forward to that but I
need to wash my hair because it is
looking bad so yeah Instagram life was
really cool thank you
anyone who joined in it was really fun I
definitely try and make that more of a
regular thing as I can but I always say
that and I always forget also loads of
blog and stuff just seeing in their
books today which was so exciting and so
many people were so supportive and
shared on their Instagram like I feel
like for years I have attended people as
book launches and it's crazy that it's
now my turn and it's so nice that people
are being so supportive like massive
shout out so far like Fleur Lindsey
Lizzie Anna Caroline who else has shared
it Susie
loads of people I'm really excited to
see everyone kind of gradually receiving
them so thank you to those people and
then we go wash my hair have a long hot
shower and I will see you guys tomorrow
okay it is Wednesday and I'm wearing the
dungarees again so I can't stop wearing
these dungarees from hush I love them
my friends Gemma and Esther day came
over this morning and they bought me the
most insane cake I will show you when I
go downstairs God my friends that just
been so lovely this week it's making me
really emotional I'm struggling to
handle all the attention but it's so
nice I'm gonna show you the cake very
very sweet of them
I'm now getting ready for my space and K
event this evening it's actually not
until I don't need to be a little sick
since 2 o'clock so I might go into town
early just cuz I don't want to kind of
sit here and get a bit like tired so I'm
gonna get ready I'm doing my makeup I've
just done my face I used the Fenty
foundation with a little bit of
hourglass as well called my makeups
really last don butter bronzer from
Physicians Formula
by Thierry blush a little bit of Becca
moon stone highlighter and now I think
I'm gonna do
the Urban Decay Naked Heat color on my
eyes what am i wearing my black polka
dot shirt I'm gonna do like a really
nice warm eyeshadow I'm watching the
Kylie Jenner baby video again it's only
the second time I've watched her dinner
why I'm doing this to myself but it's
just making me emotional and that's
about all I've got to update you on now
I'm just gonna finish off my makeup I'm
gonna put some waves into my hair I
think and then I'm gonna wear high
waisted jeans with a polka dot shirt and
I think boots which I'll probably change
into you want to get there I'm really
excited this is probably the first event
I think this might be the first event
I've ever done by myself because I
always do it with Anna so it's very
weird I think it's gonna be really
strange to not have her there but the
format will be slightly different and
I'm just really excited
everyone's like starting to receive
their books and it's it's so exciting
okay I'm gonna get ready let me use this
palette I will chat to you guys in a
little bit
does anyone else always get concealer
creasing on their eyelid oh my god my
hair is far too curly but I know it
would drop out so last night I did an
Instagram live and so many of you guys
were saying how much you want the
postcards I sent out in the blogger send
out basically I've decided that with the
ones I've got left over I'm gonna bring
them tonight to space and care event to
put in the goodie bags and I think we're
gonna get some reprinted to give them
out at my book events if I can basically
made up lots of bundles so I can bring
them with tonight for the event this is
what the cake looks like parent is not a
cake it's like hollow inside it's just
all these different types of chocolates
and sweets like all of my favorites so
around the edge they've done dairy milks
I love Dairy Milk that's a flake it says
the F word it's got like strawberries in
there Smarties minstrels literally all
of my favorite chocolates and sweets so
generous of SJ and Gemma I'm gonna take
it with I'm having like a little friends
and family party tomorrow night I'm
gonna take it with because it looks
amazing but I also kind of don't want to
share it so I'm torn but there's no air

best night I am home now and I had such
a great evening it was so nice having a
de he's my literary agent who got me the
book deal so nice having her kind of
asked me the questions I felt really
relaxed and then everyone that was there
tonight was so nice and they were asking
such great questions and I felt like we
were just having a really interesting
Chapman obviously it's nice doing Beauty
events but when you're just talking
about lipstick and stuff it's obviously
a bit different so people asking like
questions about friendship and I just
found it so interesting and I met so
