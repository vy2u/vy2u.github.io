comes to female friendships it's rarely
straightforward in fact if my 1998 diary
is anything to go by they're incredibly
complex and emotional I often go back
and read it partly because my 11 year
old self is so dramatic and hilarious
but mainly because it reminds me how
lucky I am to have such long-standing
friendships
unlike family you pick your friends and
when I look back on my life almost every
decision experience and memory comes
with a female companion somewhere behind
the scenes at almost 30 years old I feel
confident that I'm a good friend but
it's without a doubt my female friends
who have taught me how to be one so
let's talk about friendship let's talk
about the best bits the love the support
the shoulder to cry on but also let's
explore the more difficult experiences
that shape us the heartbreak the
uncertainty the emotional complexity of
it all you see there are so many
different types of friends and each is
unique in their own way
type a of the older sister friend she's
the friend to speak to you when you have
a dilemma she'll listen to your worries
and won't reply with her own problems
there's zero competition and she has the
ability to enjoy your success without
thinking of it as a failure for herself
being the younger one I was always in
awe of everything she did growing up
I've copy what she wore mimic the way
she spoke and to me she was the most
confident brave and kindest person I
knew the older sister friend is pretty
much family she's not going anywhere
type B the childhood friend the
childhood friend knows all your stories
they've heard them a million times
they're aware of all the flaws in your
personality and they accepted them a
long time ago I don't remember our very
first meeting we were only three but
when I watch back old videos of our
nursery show it's clear in the grip of
our tiny holding hands that we had no
interest in anyone else but each other
type-c the work wife I never considered
at 25 years old I'd meet someone who'd
become so important in my life
when we met we were in the Sachi the
same place in our lives doing the same
job feeling the same way and although we
came from different places with very
different backgrounds we just got each
other I thought my best friends were
sets in stone but meeting her completely
threw me because here's the thing you
never know when you're going to meet
someone new and there's always room for
another friend
I want to celebrate female friendships
all strings attached if I asked you who
is your best friend would you have an
answer
does the BFF really exist or was it all
just a popularity contest that we left
behind in the school playground they say
that making a new friend is like falling
in love there's a spark a flash of
recognition a mutual understanding and
suddenly you feel less alone
but turning that spark into a friendship
requires time and effort are you willing
to brave the world a friend dating let's
talk about the friend who takes more
than they give the ones who are
emotionally draining toxic but how do
you identify a toxic friendship and how
do you stay away from the toxic types as
we grow up we spend more time focusing
on the friendships that matter even the
ones far away and let me tell you long
distance is hard but no matter the
struggles we feel at times no matter the
let downs and strife in our
relationships with other women it seems
a reward is always far greater in the
end and I personally wouldn't have it
any other way so I wrote a book about it
