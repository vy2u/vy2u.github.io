she's falling asleep
Christmas Eve Saturday 24th of December
I just had a shower wash my hair so I
have clean hair for Christmas Day and
Boxing Day etc which just got back he's
been out this morning running errands
and look what he got
the prin I think it looks really good
obviously the white waters aren't even
but I did the air matters at all and I
think that's gonna look really cool and
he's also quite unlike DIY her husband
mode he's gonna build me the pipe this
is my idea but you're executing net
solicita if it works a pipe that kind of
comes out this is a bit of a wasted
space of my wardrobe and I said if we
have a pipe and like you just hang my
scarves in this little area let's see
that's a bit solid thing no I'm gonna do
it off their wardrobe yeah supposedly
scarves they're really light I'm gonna
quickly make the bed so other situation
and then throughout my hair situation
I'm gonna give this a go it's fun sure
Maura and it's the wonder-worker
air dry blow-dry Perfector morning oil
so I'm going to spray this on my hair I
know I've told you before but this brush
is the best thing ever
it's called the wet brush and it
literally the towel see this so rubbish
compared just go straight through I've
got cream cheese on toasted bagel bit of
orange juice and I'm gonna put on
Hollyoaks because I need to catch up but
yesterday's she's done the scarf Pole I
think this is genius what teamwork look
it's it's there he had to put this thing
to kind of support it but it doesn't
matter because I could just leave my
scarves can I put my scarves on rich
he's just gonna get some glue to make
sure everything's like super tight these
are all the scarves I have one two three
four five which means that now I have
all the space that I can sort out and
use for something else this is how it
looks from here so this is my like very
messy open water
which I hate but it's a good solution
and you have no wardrobe space and then
the bar just kind of comes out here and
my scarves are gonna hang on that pillar
let me try and hang one so I just have
to like feed it in and then if I put it
over so it's equal scarf can just hang
like that
and I've seen too rich we need to we
always put another pole underneath so it
only really fits for scarves comfortably
so I'll just fold this one up and put it
back but we can always add another one
it does add like more fullness to the
wardrobe now it just looks like I put
even more hanging but it's a good
solution because I really need to
somewhere to hang my scarfs and that was
just like a wasted space before so handy
having a handy husband now the Handy
husband is going to hang the print here
so this is our bedroom you walk through
this and then there's like another area
which but oh we were gonna put storage
up here but we just haven't and kind of
weren't sure about it but just above the
door we thought it would be cool to have
the picture so that when you're in the
hallway you can't really see it
completely as you walk through you kind
of see it and I thought it would be good
it's quite a big blank space here Rich's
we don't have space to store a ladder in
this flat so rich is standing on a like
it's not even a good stool is like a
trendy Soho House stool there's my least
favorite part of the week trying to turn
this mop into something straight and
clean looking
Oh
I just put the asparagus in the oven I'm
just some grilling and some asparagus or
roasting or whatever because we're going
to my sister's today for lunch I said
I'd make a salad we were running very
late because they have kids we always
eat like 12:30 it's so early and I'm
gonna make salad so I need to speak a
change hopefully I'll be done soon I
wouldn't say the picture hangings going
particularly well which has been here
for a while and there's quite a few
holes in the wall and there's been lots
of grunting coming from this part of the
flat we done it so good well done
high-five I need the warm here I went a
bit over the top but solid because I
wanted to have a variety of different
sizes yeah I've got this huge bowl from
West Elm now I'm gonna fill this up we
have some cucumber that's gonna do these
in like little squares I know you guys
freak out when I don't wash my veg but I
always survive I'm just gonna cut these
in half okay avocado
oh that's a good one Oh such a good mom
so I've got the salad here with leaves
cucumber tomato avocado and then I've
just taken the asparagus out and I'm
gonna kind of lay those on top okay this
is good enough I'm the worst chef in the
family look how funny this cling film is
my mom bought me it's like shower cap I
think it will work pretty well in this
situation our cap my salad we're ready
for some family time I've got my
contribution all right let the family
madness commence my best friend there's
some screaming going on in here should
we go see what's going on in here
hi Cadiz are you eating lunch already
without me how was frozen on ice no not
good
good dancing me and baby are doing a
thumb war
one two three four wait did the baguette
oh seven year old boys I've just got
home from the craziness Christmas Day is
gonna be crazy tomorrow the kids are
just mad they just like scream and run
around the whole time I am gonna sit
inside editing this video so there's not
as much to do tonight because when I get
home I'm just gonna want to go to bed so
I'm gonna try and start editing this
I've also made a cup of tea back there
and I've just bought Love Actually on
ours and I can't find Love Actually
anywhere so I've had to buy it like
$4.99 but it's so worth it I really want
to watch it I just turned the heating on
and I'm gonna get cozy we're having
serious cozy comfy times watching Love
Actually
now time to head to my parents my dad is
making us spaghetti vongole the only
thing he can cook he literally spent
like his entire life and our entire
childhood never ever been able to cook
anything but beans on toast and over the
past year he's randomly got into making
spaghetti vongole so now he makes it for
my mom every Saturday night so we're
going round to have it with them and I'm
gonna give my mom her stocking because I
did if I told you guys I did my mom
stocking this year because both my
sisters have kids and I don't and I
thought all the years that she did me
really really good stockings she like
used to give us huge sacks I thought I'd
do one for her this year be nice we're
also taking all the presents over for
tomorrow because tomorrow we've got to
take over like duvets and pillows and
loads of stuff for like staying over the
night so we're gonna take all these
around put them under the tree ready for
Christmas Day there are so many comments
on yesterday's vlog about the whole peel
the sticker off the IKEA frame and I
obviously realized pretty soon after
that
it was a sticker but the frame didn't
fit anyway it was the wrong size he
would have had to get a mount made and
it was a real hassle so I'm happy that
we just got a separate frame but some of
the comments are so rude like one of the
comments is does this girl have like any
common sense or something and I could
have easily just edited edited that part
I could have watched my video and go oh
I look really stupid if I leave this in
but I like to leave in like the real
moments so I did realize it was a
sticker that's all I wanted to say this
is the little stocking that I did for my
mom not really sure what this is but I
found it in her house my dad's prepping
his spaghetti vongole a special trap
what was at the class it's a Christmas
puddings so there's nothing to do
spaghetti bone could be maybe bungalow
hasn't started it started to open the
present so it's very exciting
she doesn't remember ever getting a sack
when she was younger so far we got a
Sarah Chapman facial oil in hand cream
oh this is my favorite one it's a spoon
now she gets the Caroline hyerin's and
pixie double cleanse particularly in
Juneau and I'm pretty sure she's falling
asleep little Anthropologie handle some
Rococo chocolates and it's like magnetic
shopping this one kekeke a weakness and
more to go she just said this is the
best stocking ever I did well I got her
