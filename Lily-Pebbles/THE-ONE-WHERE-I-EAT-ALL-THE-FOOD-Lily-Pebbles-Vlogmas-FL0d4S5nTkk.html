Friday 2nd Semba seriously can't believe
how quickly time is going I've got so
much to do before Christmas but I'm
feeling really happy to be in December I
feel like last year I was a bit of a
Scrooge about Christmas because my
birthday's in the 9th I always used to
think like I didn't want to start
embracing Christmas until after my
birthday
this year I'm kind of into it we need to
get our tree we haven't got the time to
get it so maybe we're going to try on
the weekend but we're pretty busy for
like once we have a tree things will be
getting pretty Christmasy up in here
today I'm gonna meet up with Anna and
we're spending the day with Reem and
Carrie so we're gonna meet up with them
today and have lunch and spend the day
with them I think they're gonna take us
to some cool shops that they know in
East London and I'm really looking
forward to it and I'm looking forward to
seeing Anna cause it's been about a week
and that's a long time for us just like
woken up and I've got a bit of a like
morning dry heating throat so I might
make myself a hot Ribena because that
I'd like my favorite winter drink also I
have my advent calendar to open now I'm
not gonna lie it looks like one's for
rich and one's for me but they're both
mine rich doesn't have one this year he
didn't want one and I last year I forgot
to get one and they sold out so I
panicked 4cm what - so now I'm embracing
this as a morning chocolate and an
evening chocolate because I am a
Christmas Pig right where's number two
can you do a Christmas dance this is my
Christmas arch mmm Dairy Milk all the
way we're in the same thing I always
wear at the moment but my knees are a
coat and I actually I'm hoping this is
warm because my mom said to me yesterday
what's it made out of and I looked and
it's pretty much polyester but it feels
warm
I guess I'll test it out when I go
outside taking the label off now so it's
too late to return but I do like it I've
kept the belt off for now just having my
hot Robina the first thing I'm doing
this morning is heading to the blink
brow bar in Liberty because I
desperately need my eyebrows done and
it's beautycon tomorrow gonna
it's beautiful tomorrow I have no idea
what I'm wearing but I'm going to
beautycon and so ah this comes hot I'm
now in town and I'm going to headed to
Liberty to get my brows done I'm a bit
nervous I'm using someone different
today but I'm just going to tell them
there's actually what I want so I
probably have some red brows the rest of
the day but hopefully let Harry
my browser all done and had a lady whose
armor she was great and now I'm gonna
quickly advices Christmas cards while
I'm in rest
I'm now coming to gleam off the whip
running around sound like a crazy person
and is here hello and we're going to
give our managers their Christmas
present because it's the last time we're
going to see them together for Christmas
Oh lovely cards and I was in charge of
buying the cars we bought them theater

something because we haven't got them
yet and we're gonna write this in
Christmas card to give it to them
it's support job stress and alone oK
we've arrived in to shoot becomes became
someone in shortage which is one of my
babes I'm gonna get loads of yummy food
really quite in a very hungry we're
starting with some lamb samosas and
vegetable samosas
I like the veggie oil but Raj and Oprah
fries
no that's the lamb no because that's put
in front of their lamb glad this is how
Rina Carrie set up an Instagram is very
exciting to be witnessing that story
I'll put I'll put their Instagram names
here as you guys gonna check it out I
got a garlic naan which I haven't tried
before here and chicken ruby which is
one of my favorite dishes here and some
price which I'm showing with Anna this
is a shredded and we finished on to
become into a chocolate shop called
masked oh my god wait look at all this
chocolate smells incredible in here this
is just opposite Vox Park in Shoreditch
says he just come into the smell silly
but sometimes he can't see cream left us
and we were just walking around over a
bit cold and tired so he popped in to
trade for a massive cake it suddenly got
a bit dark outside and but rich actually
works nearby so I'm meeting him here
he's gonna come meet me and then we've
got dinner books at 6:30 which is like
an hour and a half a place called
chicken sours in calm guard and it's
like fried chicken so we're gonna head
there but I'm just waiting for him now
and then we can go have a drink
somewhere maybe I'm still with Carrie
the others left us but we have
rich now we're going to hit the calm
garden find throughout the have a drink
then head to dinner who was getting a
little bit chilly now I had such a nice
time with Carrie Rima Nana though I
really like a little new crew we all
just go so well really she didn't stop
talking for hours and then I'll just
carry in the end she's so sweet
Weingarten I'm aware that today's vlog
is mainly eating that's because in
between the eating what we do a lot of
talking and talking as a philosophy so
I'm basically just filming and maybe I'm
eating and drinking today it's like a ye
in the day video unhealthy and pop so
this is like the world's biggest jenna
tonics I'm not complaining or did you
get fancy wine the place we're going for
dinner is called chick and the sours and
the Seven Dials in common garden it's
like deep fried chicken place to be
there to be fair I am still quite full
from lunch but rich is hungry so I might
just get something small especially
because they need to leave room for
something very special we're doing after
dinner but I'll tell you about that then
we're doing something really cool if I
could pop up in London at the moment and
I'm so excited so I'm not going to eat
much dinner and I think Christmas lights
in Covent Garden are so pretty this is
chicken Sawa's chicken sours
morning everybody
the biggest burger ever everything when
you get the bill you get tattooed
transfers I haven't worn one of these in
ages I used to lock them in a media
quick review on chick and salut cause
we've been to paper bird before which
you both really didn't like a similar
idea but we found the chicken to be
really like leathery that was so good
chickens ours is really good I really
recommend it it's like different types
of fried chicken but like really good
quality chicken and they do pickles and
huge like fishbowl cocktails that you
can share on the table and it was really
yummy like it so good that's really the
best fried chicken apart
yeah same it's a really cool the only
thing is it's really dark in there which
I hate because it takes me ages to read
the menu because I'm blind and it's also
quite loud but it was like really fun
music so it was okay yeah I really
recommend it ok now we're heading to a
pop-up restaurant
it's Ferrero Rocher I'll put the details
below I can't really remember the dates
it's basically a pop-up for Erica she
can like book in your time slot to have
a dining experience so basically I don't
really know what's going on it's a
Ferrero Rocher restaurant and you have a
dining experience and I love forever
washi so I saved the room it's in
Slingsby
place which is this little cute bit of
common garden
so many Christmassy lights I love it I
actually really like this little
courtyard there's loads a good
restaurant here so this is where the
Ferrero Rocher experiences
I can fight you in the ceramic wash a
salty bite around it amazing chocolate
everywhere I can't wait
apparently we ready mechanism five for
partisan every little bit is inspired by
just ha
okay so we got the whole hazelnuts the
smooth chocolate the crisp wafer
hazelnut pieces golden spark okay this
has just arrived and the guy's going to
explain to us what each of the different
thing is for oh my god this looks like
really fluffy you hardly see on camera
but that looks pretty exciting
I get really full on chocolate really
rich already needs a break dr. too and I
supposed to get the bus tomorrow because
I love candy
turned out
and things like this to get me it's like
a bit too chocolatey for me I think I'm
going to move on to the wafer
more on my street this one is like
texture with like wafer which takes a
cornflakes on the outside
delicious I love that so far three part
favorite one people Hugh knows I have a
book so I think had you that was delish
case it's open till 11 of December so
not for that long but apparently it's
booked up but there's also walking
tables she was like it's a bit like de
Shoom how you can but you could also
like cute and get table on the night so
definitely worth going to it's like a
really cool place to take some of the
birth it was something really special
and young we both now feel a bit sick
though Bates go home get to pajamas I
just realized that I was taking my
makeup off and I haven't even ended the
vlog yet we're home and we had a really
nice evening actually sorry bitchy I
really like chicks and sours our clothes
do smell a bit which I always find a bit
annoying when you go to a restaurant but
it was a really good food
very very cool place for our or she pays
is fun if I the adverse fear and there
could have been better it was a little
bit of anticlimax but if you love for
our show you're just gonna love it
obviously so now I'm just taking my
makeup off I think I'm going to use um
Caroline's pixie cleanser because I'm
really loving this at the moment
