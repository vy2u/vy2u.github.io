made a video on the only makeup products
that you need well today's video is a
follow on from that but instead I'm
talking about makeup brushes now I know
all about makeup brush hoarding I'm
definitely guilty of that but if I had
to pick either be my absolute essentials
and I would happily use just these alone
if you're after a foundation brush then
my recommendation would be this one for
Bobby Brown it's really soft and it
lasts in liquid foundation really well
but I actually use a sponge for my
foundation I know it's not a brush but I
had to put it in this video
this one from Real Techniques is my
favorite because of the shape I find it
works really well for both Foundation
and concealer I like to make mine really
damp before using it to balance the
foundation into my skin it leaves my
skin glowing with a perfect medium
coverage this brush is the setting brush
from Real Techniques and it's great for
both concealer and for powder I find
it's the perfect size for getting under
the eyes and around the nose another
Real Techniques brush this is one from
their new collection and I use this
bronzer but you could also use it for
all over powder it's very soft
and picks up the product really well I
really like the pointed tip for getting
right into the cheekbone I've loved this
Bobbi Brown brush for years I use it
mainly for blusher and it's amazing but
it can also be used for powdering and
for subtle contouring I just love the
shape the quality and the way the hairs
pick up product I'm going to be using
cream products this is the brush I go
for it works well for cream bronzer
highlighter and blusher and it's the
perfect shape for all three I picked up
this morphe brush in America and I'm so
glad I did I use this for powder
highlight it's not too small and it's
not too big so it applies the perfect
amount to the tops of my cheek bone now
don't call me crazy but there really are
any two brushes I really need my eyes I
use this soft crease brush to apply
products all over the lid and blend out
and if I need to apply another color to
the crease I use the same brush and the
shape works perfectly for me I really
rate though either brushes the petite
crease brush is what I use to apply
shadow under the eye and then I also use
a brush if I would blend out my Kohl
eyeliner and that's it my eighth
favorite makeup brushes well seven and a
sponge don't forget to check the
description box for all the brush
details and link and please subscribe to
my
if you haven't yet thanks so much for
watching and I'll see you in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
