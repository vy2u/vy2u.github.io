overwhelming with new launches almost
every day it's impossible to know which
products we really need so in this video
I'm going to be talking to you about my
makeup bag essentials the products I
think you really need this one's from
Muji I love it because it's such a good
size and it's clear so you can see what
you want to get out I'm going to talk
you through all the products and why I
think they're so great the Too Faced
hangover primer is my absolute favorite
I've actually just finished this one I
like it because it isn't silicone based
primer so it doesn't feel too slippy it
just feels really hydrating on my dry
skin and it's a great base before
putting on your foundation for
foundation I've obviously picked the it
cosmetics CC cream it has the coverage
of her foundation but the finish of a
tinted moisturizer so it's really
hydrating it's really glowy I like to
mix two shades and apply it with a
sponge but you can also use your fingers
it's got such a nice lemony scent which
i think is really nice and refreshing in
the morning when doing your makeup the
concealer I picked this one from
Maybelline because I think the sponge
applicator although it's not the most
hygienic it's so easy to use and I've
really been enjoying this recently it's
got really good coverage but it's not
cakey it has a really nice glowy finish
to it for powder I've picked this one
from hourglass which is dim light
because it's the least powdery powder
ever it softens and diffuses the light
on your skin and sets your makeup but
you really can't detect if there's any
powder on the skin this is by far my
favorite powder for bronzer I actually
asked on Twitter and so many of you guys
said this is your favorite it's from the
body shop it's the honey bronzer I love
it too it's so nice to go on matte
finish it comes in quite a few different
shades and for me it's just the perfect
everyday bronzer for blusher I've picked
one from Bobbi Brown because Bobbi Brown
has an amazing selection of blusher
shades and I would recommend picking one
that's the color that you naturally
flush when you're like hot or
embarrassed pick that color and it will
definitely look good on you for
highlight I picked hush from Mac I will
this on my wedding day and I absolutely
love it it's a cream color base so
really kind of meshes
the skin looks really natural makes your
skin look plump
I love the golden peachy shade for brows
I like to use a pencil and a clear brow
gel if you have thinner brows than I do
then you can also use a powder and a
brush for a really natural look but I
just like using the spoolie to brush
through my brows and then I use the
really thin pencil just to fill in where
there are any gaps the clear brow gel
just sets everything in place and keeps
them in the same place all day for
eyeshadows I've kind of put together my
Ultima Mac quad in this quad is all that
glitters cork saddle and wood wink and
here I'm just using wood wink all over
the lid and under the eye is such a
gorgeous juanzi shade and it works
really well for day or for night I love
wearing eyeliner if you like black
liquid liner throw one of those in your
makeup bag but I'm a brown coal liner
kind of girl and I love just putting it
on the top of my lash line it defines
everything and looks great for mascara I
picked the waterproof formula because I
think this works really well for day and
night it's going to last longer it's
going to keep the curl longer in your
lashes and this one from Bourjois just
gives so much length to my lashes which
is why I really like it it's a bit more
subtle but very pretty I don't think you
need more than two lip products in your
makeup bag and nude and something a bit
more bold for the nude lip I've picked
this one from hourglass it's really
creamy it's really easy to wear there
quite a few shades to pick from in the
range this is like a really nice peachy
nude and I really like it
for a slightly more bold shade I've
picked this liquid lipstick from Stila
I'm not that into red anymore but this
is like a deep berry shade I think it's
really pretty really flattering and
because it's a liquid lipstick you know
it will set and stay in place
and last all evening I think with these
products you can make a really pretty
makeup
look and please leave me a comment to
