all about the wedding so it's really
exciting being all of your comments
thank you so much if you've watched it
and commented I can't wait to share more
with you guys but today's Sunday
yesterday I spent the day cleaning out
the flat and I'm going to show you my
bathroom because I'm so impressed with
what I've done I don't have time now

I'll do that later
I've just got ready which has been at
the gym this morning I'm gonna pick him
up I think we're gonna have breakfast
and maybe go to Covent Garden I just
feel like I need to like get out and see
things like just even if it's shopping
just like go into town yesterday we like
stayed in all day so I just want to go
out because later we're having like a
late lunch with my family and we'll
probably just like stay in for the rest
of the day quickly before I carry on
with this vlog I also have a really
exciting announcement for you today if
you follow my blog you would have seen
the blog post that's gone up
earlier today about me and Anna doing
this a couple of meetups there are two
meetups I'm so so excited both with
Liberty London and look good feel better
the charity that were both digital
ambassadors for one of the events is not
ticketed you can just come after work
hang out with us go shopping
loads of the proceeds will be going to
look good feel better from the night
it's in Liberty Beauty hall it's going
to be such a fun evening hopefully lots
of people will be coming and then the
second event is something really special
that we've never done before it's a
little bit like a beauty chat live but
it's going to be an intimate afternoon
tea so you can buy a ticket the proceeds
from the ticket price will go to look
good feel better you'll get a goodie bag
a whole afternoon tea glass of Prosecco
and we're going to be they're going to
do a little beauty chat we're going to
come and chat to everyone hang out and
there's going to be two sessions so I
know it's a little bit complicated but
it's all in that blog post so head over
to Lily pebbles code at UK if you would
like to come to either of those events
they're both in London they're both a
Liberty which is one of our favourite
stores in London and I can't wait we
haven't done meetup in so long so I'm
really excited for that actually quickly
show you before I go I did a makeup kind
of declutter and I tried to film it I
haven't checked the footage yet I hope
that it's come out okay if it has I am
going to do a video on it but I played
out my drawers I know that looks like
loads see
sleep like this rule was overflowing so
it's all nice and tidy now the bathroom
was so crazy like this whole area was
filled with products and now I've put
them all neatly away in here so you have
like bath and body products and like on
a bath body on their weight bath their
few habits and then like body stuff down
there look at this first of all this
whole area is like nice and tidy a nice
little plant there Oh heavenly I've got
like toners moisturizers cleansers oils
and serums and then these are like masks
and like spot products and then those
are stairs up there it feels so good
right I'm gonna head and pick up rich
now I find it really hard to vlog now
after my friends did like the piss-take
video of me vlogging everything I say I
could just hear them all saying it they
got it down to a tee I think later what
I'm going to do is insert a few clips
from that video I do want to put the
whole video up because some parts people
like show their front door in it and
it's like a bit of invasion of privacy
some parts like my dad's in it topless I
just don't think that needs to be on the
Internet
I'll show you some of the funny clips
because it was just it was so funny
she's had a yummy breakfast rich is here
my husband
honey we need to get his bike back in
the car I said I was going to try to
have a run
over there it's really high where do I
do now
you need this pedals oh really okay so
I'm gonna work now we're going to go to
Covent Garden and have a quick like
hour-and-a-half mooch I've got a voucher
for Reese so I really want to look and
see what's in there
anyway you want to look in copper garden
no he's boys coat which was bought a Ben
Sherman coat he's always on the lookout
for a coat so pretty happy about that me
and rich are just talking about the post
wedding feeling and it's quite different
as you we both feel quite different than
what we thought first of all the whole
like nothing changes nothing changes but
we both agree that we feel like we love
each other a little bit more which is
nice as she rich said that his love has
catapulted for me which was very sweet
and we do feel a bit different actually
definitely feel like more married and
also we don't have like post-wedding
blues if anything I think we both feel
like it's really exciting like fresh
start it's because it's kind of autumn
time anyway the weather's changed and
the whole lead-up to the wedding I just
felt like I wasn't even with it I was so
in another world I kept trying to put
putting everything off that now finally
I can just get back into work and like
cleared out the flat and everything
feels new and fresh and exciting so
sorry slam we don't really have
post-wedding blues beside it's over but
it went so well that I like wouldn't
want to do it again in case it wasn't
the same you know we just excited and we
live it all with photos and videos how
do you feel post wedding good got a bit
of chest chesty cough I didn't really
mean that right now I feel great I want
to get back into life enjoying married
life now and you've got some new jewelry
as well yeah yeah let's get a cup of
garden do
we're having a slight issue with parking
common garden is like the most difficult
place to park even on a Sunday it's all
just residents first stop hmm because
now it's autumn I need two new desktops
I wear them under everything and I go
through them and - Oh gross and old so I
need to get some new black and gray
desktops just trying on this coat and
Reese which I think I really like but I
definitely need to think about it it's
quite smart
I have a thing just in Urban Outfitters
trying on it this kind of faux denim
shirt
this t-shirt
I think I'm going to go into the bakery
to see if I could find an eclair I just
can't stop eating rubbish
I wasn't like on a bridal diet but the
two weeks leading up to the wedding I
was definitely trying not to eat like
really rubbish I don't want to feel
rubbish that's kind of why so now the
wedding's been I just can't stop eating
things and I'm craving eclairs at the
time we're now heading to my parents
house to have a late family lunch and
it's nice if we haven't actually really
seen everyone since the wedding probably
because we went away and so ya can have
lunch with all the kids and everyone
mom's made homemade salt beef for lunch
I'm so excited and what's in the oven
luck cos mmm oh now my camera see me
salads
mmm this is baby Soren look how much
he's grown up and he's discovered the
jumper ooh is it jumbo or jumparoo
jumparoo jumper ooh
and that all he wants to do is jump room
oh yeah now you just want to jump dad
mom mmm Sophie oh my gosh these are the
best this is the dessert we have peach
and mango apple cake honey cake lemon
drizzle cake and a random bowl of
pomegranate seeds
I think that's meant to go in there but
mum was worried that the kids would need
to her soren just tried mushed up banana
I should have logged that sorry I just
tried mushed up banana for the very
first time he's only like four months
but he's pretty grown-up what did you
think of that hour 10 he's literally
blanking me what did he think of the
banana what did you think the banana
camera-shy
got ya I'm home now from all the madness
of all the kids and I thought that I
would show you guys some of that video
that I mentioned in our wedding video if
you haven't watched that basically our
friends my sister's Anna and surprised
us all at the wedding this huge
projector screen came out and they
surprised us with this video that's
basically a massive jokey video taking
the piss out of what I do obviously they
don't mean it they all like I think
they're all very proud of me but it's
kind of like you know if you have a
friend as a vlogger it's a very easy
thing to take the mickey out of and it
was so so funny but I'm not gonna put
the whole video online because there are
parts I think a bit inappropriate to put
online instead I thought I'd put some
clips into this vlog and show you and it
did such an amazing job of editing it
all together there was like 143 clips
and I know how stressful they is the
people send you new things and also
quite hard to like pick the good stuff
as well so she did very well
I think my sister Carly kind of
orchestrated the whole thing but
everyone so many people like put clips
in there might be some people in this
video you don't know so I'll try and
like annotate on the screen but let me
show you some of the clips that were in
this video
forget shoebox filled lilies
morning guys morning guys morning guys
morning guys morning guys
morning guys I just wakin up I fancy
vlogging today I don't know why because
I'm not doing anything politically
interesting and I'm about to start to
get dressed okay so this is my outfit
for today so I've got my address t-shirt
on and shorts I got I thought these from
next that's my look for today it's a
very casual Sunday look you know very
jewy
I like jewy skin it's making me little
like that and giving it again dad needs
me done oh sorry I forgot to blog my
blog um which which he can't hear me but
anyways I'm going into town and I've got
some very important meetings planned and
then also very important lunch at one of
my favorites so if you haven't quite
gathered yet they're pretending to be me
and rich instead of like being
themselves all the girls are playing
lilies and all the guys are playing rich
maybe let's get back to it
case Amin and I we're just going to go
get some lunch and we're thinking that
we kind of want something healthy
yeah but you always want time you sure
you don't want have I do love time
ah back from shopping thought I'd show
you I got a little quick haul some
moisturizing cream and some Nespresso
descaling so then it's couple of clips
basically involved mark being topless
and my dad being topless so I don't
think I'm going to put those in but
they're basically taking the mick out of
rich always walking around the flat like
stretching after he's been exercising
and apparently topless I didn't realize
he was topless that often but according
to this he is so let's skip over the
topless bits I keep getting a recognized
in the street the my snapchats gone
viral so I think if we wear sunglasses
all the videos from now on I won't be
recognized again to make PG tipps hot
water skim milk there twice three times
four times there yeah that's how you
make a cup of tea
so we me and rich are just on our way
and we're gonna grab a quick bite to eat
we'll snapchat you when we get there on
my bike what invites love ride a bike
just on our way back home it was a
really nice evening rich what's your
thought of the day who decided sausages
'ice a sausage we got a thought
to the day for us today wasn't gluestick
the inside of the bottle the
hummingbirds hum because they don't know
the words whales is his own country yet
you don't need a passport to go there um
so I'll be growing a beard you see and
I've always wondered at what point does
your face decide that it's hair and then
pubes I'd understand that sorry rich got
a bit deep there and sometimes being an
Instagram husband can can take its toll
