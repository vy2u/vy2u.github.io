watching this it's hopefully the first
of December so the first day of love
must I know I do it a bit differently
some people start vlogging on the first
and put it up on the second but this
year you know I'm not following any
rules as I said to you guys before I
might not vlog every single day this
December but I'm going to vlog whenever
I have something interesting happening
and then sometimes if I need to have a
day at home working I'm just going to
take the day off
vlogging so hopefully there'll be lots
of vlogs up in December because I really
have lots of cool plans that I know I'm
gonna wanna vlog I'm getting my hair
done I've got some meetings and tonight
I'm going to zanna's book launch I've
never actually met Zanna before she's
really good friends of Ana I've had some
great things and we talk a lot online so
I'm looking forward to meeting her and
celebrating her new book which is called
strong I've just got off kind of running
late I was really tired this morning had
a bit of a lazy lion which isn't great
so I've just made myself a cup of tea to
wake myself up and I'm going to do my
makeup try and make my hair look semi
decent I'm going to the hairdresser
anyway so there's no point like making
it look nice so hope you guys will enjoy
watching all my vlogs this month I've
done my hair and makeup
well I've tied my hair up and I'm gonna
probably head into town because I really
want to go to the reefs in Knightsbridge
I'm desperately on the hunt for the
resealing aviator coat it's super
expensive but they have a really hefty
voucher from there that's the only
reason why I would get that one
I know Topshop and Zara also do a nice
black shearling jacket but I find that
the Shailene on those are quite hard
where is the resource quite fluffy and
warm and I mean to be as I might not get
it and might get something else instead
but I'm just on the hunt for a warm
winter coat because it's so cold in
London at the moment anyway I'm
desperate on the hunt for the Rhys
jacket in a medium anna is also
desperately on the hunt for the coat I
mean we just have the same taste you
might as well share a wardrobe neither
of us care if we are just the same you
guys always comment on the fact that we
are copying each other but we're really
not we both fully aware that we like the
same things
and we're fine with it so I'm looking
for a medium and I haven't been too
one in Knightsbridge yet so I'm hoping
they have it but it's sold out online
which just makes me think that it sold
out in stores too I'm just gonna go have
a look anyway I go get my hair done in
hirtius ins the one in Harvey Nichols I
haven't really got a stylist there I
prefer who do I use last time we can't
remember but I used someone in the
conduit Street store for a cut last time
and I really liked it but today I'm
getting color and my colorist is Jason
Potter Dixon and he's in the Harvey
Nichols store and he's great so I'm
going there to get color and I think I'm
getting a olaplex treatment which is
like a deep hydration conditioning
treatment to stop my hair from being
frizzy and it's not it's never going to
stop this this is just life but and then
I'll just get it blow-dried afterwards
I'm not getting a cut today I'm so
obsessed at the moment wearing my
Topshop jeans with my jigsaw boots and
also just like the blush color of this
next Co I love it so much so this is
what I'm wearing today I'm actually
wearing like a nice black top but I'm
gonna be cold all day so I'm wearing a
jumper and I'll just take that off this
evening when I go to the event and my
birthday bag which is the Gucci Soho
disco bag and round other stories got
this basically like my uniform at the
moment just coming to Zara's try on
their version and it's so nice so
similar to the one from Rhys
this one's 90 pounds which compared to
Rhys which is 850
I'm definitely gonna get this one what
steal I think it's so water tech furry
the whole way inside so glad I found
this although I think no I'm from Reese
is better quality this sort of jacket
because it's quite like on trend I might
not want to wear it forever and I think
you're going to spent 800 pounds it
needs to be a forever coat so this is
perfect for like just winter 9 pounds
are still expensive but it's so soft I'm
so glad that I found that comenzará
because I just feel so much more
comfortable fine in that price because I
dinner in the past I thought like trendy
coats and then a year later I don't like
them anymore so because it's such like a
standout piece like an aviator jacket
just in case I'd rather not invest in a
piece like that
we're 90 pounds is still a lot but it's
so at the old PD really walk so now I'm
moving to Paris's to get my hair colored
having a nice hair wash that's always
the highlight okay so the plan for today
is to cover my gray hairs but just pick
them out not die the top because we
quite like my natural hair color there
and then we agreed that we like this
color but it's just growing out so take
another liar but not all the way to the
roots so I kind of like to sandy shades
stop on there partly a few colors are
quite in at the moment that's amore or
you were born to be on this blue and I'm
hard to breathe hey this colors going to
say in half an hour
and as you sushi I'm not actually a big
fan of you see - but this is all they
kind of have here so I've got it
upstairs
have left Hirsch sins and I absolutely
love the color I think is the best yet
like I'd like to be set word Jason did
such a good job of like lifting the
color but keeping it quite like earthy
and not too blond because of assets
winter I'm now in Clerkenwell which is a
bit random afar but I'm taking some
photos for a job then I'm going to head
back to Covent Garden I just popped in
to Kiki K to get some thank-you cards
it's such a nice stationery shop in
cooking garden if you guys ever in the
area and now I'm heading for a meeting a
meeting PR and I'm sure you guys know if
your press sometimes you meet up with
PRS who look after brands and they kind
of update me on what's new any new
products and stuff like that and today
I'm meeting PR who looks off to Sarah
Chapman and some other brands as well so
I'm gonna go have a cup of tea and then
go to Sam's book launch everything I'm
really gonna be able to film this I try
to hit some clips and I'll talk to you
off
just by Somerset House by the Thames and
I'm walking to zanna's but I'm a bit
early but I'm walking quite slow so I'll
probably get there on time before it's
seen Carly and really fast get in
actually maybe lean machines but I just
love being like near the Thames at night
with all the lights so pretty eyes I
have a problem my hair is so static okay
it just got home rich kindly picking up
from the station God the tube was crazy
today also I'm going to start doing
thoughts of the days I think when I have
them too if you have one but I have a
think for in this vlog I know everyone's
gonna want riches thought of the day
I've got one but wait not yet anyway I'm
home rich if you notice my hair looks
good nice and curly I think anything
else will have I had done to it so
flight Khalid yeah you every like kind
of some reason my hair's really static I
don't know faster olaplex treatment I
don't know what that is I'm really glad
I went to zanna's book launch it was a
completely strange experience of Meeks
normally I go to beauty events and I'm
not gonna lie I walk in I pretty much
know everyone we all go to the same
events I walked into this one didn't
know single bus and I was like Lily
loner in the corner until I saw like
Carlene Leone I didn't know anyone and
everyone had amazing bombs like everyone
right she would have died anyway I'm
really passionate about supporting women
who are doing cool things so I'm really
glad I went as for Susana and it's a
book notes you're gonna like this anyway
I got a goodie bag full of healthy
things and I mean I might like some of
it but you know who's gonna love all of
it just guy over here put the link to
this on Amazon if you guys are
interested it's like Fitness e staff and
recipes and nutritional Fiji water later
you're not very impressed gonna smoke
right yeah I know these bounce alright
so you're basically looking saying you
don't know yeah I haven't tried that
what is it don't do easy and damn I see
that at plan organic graze box right
geez alright it's not he's not impressed
Lana good do one what's that what is
that yeah cashew nuts sunflower seeds
almonds
I use this goodie bag to bribe rich pick
me up the station I was like I have a
bag of healthy treats if you pick me up
vegan lean protein tried that sleep easy
young favorite oh my god Wow she should
be the butter I was amazing to read
complimentary visits don't even try and
make me use that ozzie bodies protein
butter caramel mom they go don't say I
never get you anything
what's up I miss ya rich is now reading
zanna's book and shouting from the
bedroom she's got skipping in here Lily
he's just desperate for me to start
exercising more I'm gonna make some
pasta because I'm hungry and I haven't
got much time because the missing is on
tonight's the final episode of the
missing I can't deal with it I really
hope it gives us closure I just can't I
can't even do if you haven't watched it
yet you need to watch season two it's
incredible you don't need to watch
season one to watch season two they're
not linked it's amazing my thought of
the day is that the London Underground
needs to be more tourist friendly
clearly there are a lot of tourists in
London and it's great we love tourists
but I think for the tube to run smoothly
everyone needs to know the rules
you know the priority seat moved down
the middle all these things are very
important how are these poor tourists
supposed to know what to do if all the
signs are in English like we should have
there's so much room where all that
advertising is we should have the
sentences translated into like the top
five most spoken languages or something
I was looking around today thinking
everything is in English we just assume
is such like an arrogant country we just
assume that everybody's English well
they don't and I think if these tourists
knew that they had to move down the tube
or that they had to give up their seat
to the elderly or pregnant and I think
they would but how are they supposed to
know if they can't read it that's my
thought of the day which is ain't Grich
he said missed it sorry okay we'll have
a thing if you have a thought of the day
okay
don't force it there someone else had a
thought of the day and it's intrigued
him all right I'm gonna make some dinner
while you think about that nothing like
a fitness event to make you want loads
of carbs I'm eating a massive bowl of
pesto pasta and we're about to watch the
missing and I'm so excited I think I'm
gonna end my vlog here I won't ruin it
for any of you that haven't seen it but
I hope you enjoyed this vlog and I will
see you next one bye wait if you don't
think I thought of the day it's no
remindful day
also think is a great thought how do
flies breathe like normal huh
it's breathe like every other insect
breathe serving their lungs or aha
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
