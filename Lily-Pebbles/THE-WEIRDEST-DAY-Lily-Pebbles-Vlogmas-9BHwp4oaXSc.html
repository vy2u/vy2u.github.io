morning which is nowhere to be seen
I think he's gone to the gym I'm pretty
sure he woke me up and told me but
Saturday morning I don't get it he's
gone to the gym he's going to pick up
some parcels for my parents house and
he's taken all the Christmas decorations
out of our cupboard because he's
convinced we have loads but I don't
think we have enough and I don't want to
get the tree and then it sit there empty
like non decorated for days because we
haven't got enough decorations so I'm
gonna quickly look through all the
decorations now I can't bother to get
ready yet it's beautycon later today so
I need to like actually do my makeup
nicely and stuff so I'm just gonna have
a look through the decorations now this
is what we seem to have okay so a tea
warm LED lights those for the tree 300
okay we definitely have enough lights so
baby I know but those have a white oh I
think these the ones we put around the
house around the flat and these we put
on the trees maybe we need more of those
what's in here these are the ones we
have from last year these were from hmm
home but these are just like cheapy ones
I got from home base to make my vlogmas
in show these stars I really like from
the white company we've got enough of
those and we've got a couple of these
when we went to suffer the release to go
from Christmas market and we also got
like three big ones like that and then
three medium ones but I don't think
we've also got like a random all and
where's my L oh yeah that's my Alan I
don't think we've got like enough of one
type I feel like you need to have a
consistent like maybe I should get some
red ones I need a color going on I
should I don't think I want red I also
love the little dairy milk chocolates
you hang on the tree talking of dairy
milk chocolate actually the most been
calendar day number three
have you written to Santa you also have
this just like a Merry Christmas thing
we're gonna hang that in the mirror just
making the bed I've shown you guys these
pillows before little spoon and big
spoon
and I am the big spoon and I feel like
maybe not most girls are probably the
little spoon I'm definitely the big
spoon and can you guys leave a comment
on this video and let me know if you're
the little spoon or the big spoon leave
me a comment while I make the bed I'm
gonna start getting ready now for
beautycon and doing my makeup cause I
let's take my time do my makeup think
I'm gonna be wearing black top black
trousers and this kind of pink blazer I
have it's like a pink metallic blazer
from Topshop I'll show you in a minute
so I'll keep my makeup pretty similar
I've got a nice nas eyeshadow that I'm
gonna put on my lids that's like
slightly pink is a bit like Mac all that
glitters I'm obsessed with it at the
moment this is the NARS eyeshadow I'm
obsessed it's called quarry it's like a
light pink shimmer and it's so pretty
just to put all over the lid I've done
my hair and my makeup now and it's so
cold in the flat so just put like a cozy
jumper before I put on my blazer for
beautycon I'm so jealous rich is having
a tracksuit bottom day at home all day
today he's gonna do some work because
also gonna watch some TV and it's just
so cold out he's gonna spend the whole
day in comfy clothes and I am so jealous
I am looking forward to beautycon but it
does feel like work on a Saturday I'm
actually going to do a panel
it's called inspired by and I think the
panel is about kind of what to do when
you lack inspiration for videos and get
in a bit of a rut I'm not doing a
meet-up because I don't do those sort of
meetups where it's like a queue where
you queue for someone and then you kind
of have a hug and photo and move on it's
just not how I like to meet you guys
I'm sure a lot of you've been to my
meetups before we have me and Anna like
spend a lot of time like talking to you
guys I'm getting to know you and find
out what you do so we normally link with
Barnes through meetups just so that we
can have a good venue space and it can
be ticketed and you guys get the most
out of a meet-up so I don't tend to do
meetups at conventions but I'm going to
go along and do a panel and hopefully
just meet as many of you as I can just
when I'm walking around I've just put up
this Merry Christmas like bunting
although the M looks a bit funny it's
from my cell me actually send it to me
and it's so cute rich has just come back
and he's bought me a naked burrito so I
can quickly eat before I head to
beautycon yeah I think the
is what I'm gonna wear today into
beautycon and I had this little black
top on and then this is from Topshop
it's like a metallic pink blazer again I
think it's kind of gross but I like
clothes that are weird it's maybe a
little bit too long but it's different
make you Chi Soho disco bag these
trousers and Zara and my boots from
Jerusalem hmm
you know you're married when your
husband is stroking your legs to check
that the tiny bit of ankle you have on
show doesn't have any hair on it oh good
yeah all about heart Christmas radio oh
yeah last time I spoke to you I was
getting in my car to go drive to
beautycon and that was at one o'clock
and it's now quarter to four I've
explained more when I'm home but me and
Georgia here go into a really bad car
crash and a lorry went into us and
spotting us sideways and drove into us
for about 50 meters down the road and it
was absolutely terrifying and I have no
IDE ever no idea how we're alive
literally but anyway I'll explain more
we were very cold if you stand outside
for a long time we're very shaken but I
came to the conclusion after lots of
thinking I'm going to try my best to get
to PT con anyway because I feel ok to be
honest I feel really happy that I'm
alive and I want to go because I've told
a lot of people I'm gonna be there so
we've got 15 minutes and I need to be on
a panel and we can't co-holder the lady
who had already told that we weren't
going to be
to say we are going to be there I'm
trying very hard and hopefully we'll get
there if I don't get to be on the panel
then I'll just try and say hi to as many
people as possible
my hands are very cold we're very very
lucky and I'll explain more about what
happened later on today can't believe I
think we're actually going to make it
like a mess but we're gonna make it my
right arms gotten on I think it's just
too cold running organizing my content I
found that it stopped me being as
creative so I when now unless I organize
the video that commemorates if I could
be limit which is why I love doing vlogs
because you change it as you go so I try
not to find too much anymore but this
year I've tried to be more flexible with
my content I find it really helps and
also just writing down ideas wherever
you are like always on my notes from on
the tube or anywhere I just write down
ideas sometimes new videos you want to
make whether or not they can enjoy it
which is what I try to do like sometimes
I'll do a video that I know not many
people look at I watch it like I love
I got bit like I'm good I'm gonna make
attacking people okay I'm home
and rich is still waiting with the car
it's just been a nightmare trying to get
that car moved I don't know what I've
said and why I haven't said so let me
quickly run through what's happened
today because it has been the weirdest
day and I just didn't expect any of this
to happen
and I wasn't sure what I wanted to vlog
and what I didn't and well I don't know
on our way to beautycon we were about 15
minutes away I was driving and yeah I
was just driving in the middle lane and
before I knew it my car started like
kind of going about out of control
almost when you're like driving on ice
it starts like going a bit funny and it
was almost like in slow motion my car
like swerved and ended up sideways in
the right-hand lane in front of this
lorry so right we don't really know to
be honest but we think that maybe the
lorry like had moved into the left-hand
lane but not seeing me because it's such
a blind spot cuz he's so high up and I'm
so low that he might have like clipped
my car which made it like spin round and
then my car was in front of this lorry
and he was driving for like 50 meters I
think I'm not very good with distance it
felt like such a long time we've got a
photo like the tyre marks of how far we
were driving and me and Georgia were
just staring each other in the eye like
terrified thinking we're gonna start
tumbling or we're gonna go into the
other lane this was like a busy London
Road lots of cars going very fast and I
genuinely I don't like to be dramatic I
genuinely thought we were going to die
and then the car eventually stopped and
I said to Georgia are we alive and she
said yes we were just going oh my god oh
my god oh my god the whole time and we
got out and we were just so happy that
we were okay because we were completely
we didn't understand how that we were
okay so to be honest that's all I care
about that we were both fine I don't
think we have any injuries the whole my
whole car's written off but I don't
think there was
have an impact my right arm hurts a bit
you honestly don't know if it's from
personal training or not but my right
side does hurt a bit more and I know
with these things they can come later on
so I'm gonna just try and be really
aware of my body tonight and tomorrow
I'm gonna have a bath now I'm little bit
shaky I was very shaky afterwards going
through beautycon was actually quite a
distraction I know people my fingers
weird that I went but I just felt like I
had told so many people I was going and
I did meet lots of people there so I'm
glad I went and didn't stay too long I
did my panel saw some people in the left
I'm just so grateful that I'm okay it
was a very scary day and I'm pissed off
that my car's written off and we're
gonna have to claim on insurance and our
insurance is gonna go up and all these
annoying things that come with accidents
that aren't really your fault
definitely not my fault but I'm also
looking forward to getting like
hopefully a camera footage from the
lorry and CCTV so we can actually see
what happened there was a witness who
said he saw it all he didn't think it
was our fault just kind of intrigued
because I'm so confused what happened
I've been driving for 11 years and I've
never been in any kind of accident yeah
I'm just so grateful and happy right now
that I'm okay I'm gonna run myself a
bath oh my god I am like mentally and
physically exhausted but thank you to
the girls who I saw at beautycon it was
so nice to chat to everyone
I much prefer doing meetups that way I
got to like have some really good shots
of people where I got to meet some
people have already met before and it
was lovely if I'm if you thought I was
being weird and I don't know why I was
being weird I think the shock his
comment a bit later so I'm gonna end
this vlog here I'm gonna order Domino's
now I cost crying and I have no reason
and I'm absolutely fine I just can't
talk okay I'm gonna end this vlog here
thank you so much for watching I am NOT
gonna call this vlog I got into a car
crash because I do not believe in
clickbait and I think it's a bad thing
to do and I'm not gonna use my shitty
experience to try and gain views so
thank you to those of you who watched
this just because he wants to watch my
vlogmas video today I'm gonna go eat a
lot of pizza and I'm going to watch I'm
celebrity get me out of here and I will
be absolutely fine I'm very grateful and
