Richard actually working from home this
morning because we're going to do
something fun together this afternoon
which should be nice but I'm just going
to get some work done this morning I've
just been back in the office for a few
days since Lisbon trying to get back
into the swing of things but feeling
good about work I think sometimes when
it's like a little bit quiet I get
nervous or suddenly it's going to get
really busy again I think on top of
things at the moment we've just been
glued to the TV because obviously
yesterday was the general election and
like seeing it all unfold this morning
trying to make sense of it all but
before I get with work I wanted to
quickly show you what I made for dinner
last night because I can't stop thinking
about how great it was Anna and I met
Madeline Shore this week we actually
interviewed her for our podcast at home
with and pretty sure today it would have
gone up I think I really hope hadn't got
the exercise wrong and just ruined what
the next one is I'm pretty sure it's
Madeline shields episode I'll link
whoever is down below anyway Anna was
saying how she was going to go home that
evening and make her porn calmer curry
and I absolutely love calmer so the next
day I've got all the ingredients for it
it's from this book which it has served
but a year of beautiful eating is all
about eating and with throughout seasons
and like what's in season fresh fresh
produce okay so this is the coconut
spiced porn calmer and looks like this
and I think the main thing I learned
from cooking this one and she tells you
to
without cashew nuts and coconut milk
together and I've made curries before
I've never done that and it made it so
creamy and delicious Oh me and rich or
both like Ethernet like oh my god this
is so good so that's an exciting that we
found a new meal that we're probably
going to want to look like every week
now I thought I would quickly tell you
guys because I love my dimensionless
books are so easy and delicious okay I'm
going to get on with some work and then
I'll come back to you guys when I'm
doing my makeup and hair and stuff well
I can't believe how much can change in a
couple of hours but I've been sitting my
desk in some work and now I feel pretty
nervous about how the projects are
working on and from the video next week
there's quite a big production and it's
just me like organizing the props the
creators of the video it's a job so
making sure I get the right messaging in
I just feel like there's a lot of
logistics to it so I'm feeling a little
bit nervous about that but hopefully it
will come together I'm going to do my
makeup because well what choice I think
we're leaving soon ish I think I'm going
to wear all the usual stuff today this
is my daily makeup stash I think I'm
going to stick to you might eat
cosmetics CC cream which by the way is
now available in Selfridges which is so
exciting because I would recommend this
to all of my friends and they can never
be bothered to show up once for online
so you can get this now and Selfridges
just heating up some tomato soup for me
enriched and we've got some bread have
was it yeah I just got ready I found my
hair and makeup all right in black
liquid liner which I haven't done in a
long time that makes me feel like I look
really weird I'm just not used to seeing
it and this top is from whistles and you
guys have seen at my gap genes my
trainers kind of comfy but I love this
jump jump with the tassels so Richard
having the afternoon off work which is
we're going to descent very exciting
tomorrow is this is actually such
coincidence I didn't know this when we
booked it but tomorrow's national gin
day and today we're going to sip Smith
gin as I said we're going to their
factory called a factory distillery
that's what it's called the SIP Smith's
gin distillery and they basically opened
up to us and they're going to give me a
rich like a little private tour around
and show us how they make the gym which
is just so fun I love that kind of stuff
so we're going to head there it's
Chyzyk get into this yeah as in Chizik
so it's quite far from us gonna take us
like over an hour to get there so we're
going to head there now and then I think
we're going to head complete my
management because it was my manager
George's birthday yesterday and on a
Friday in the office they do fizzy
Fridays where they like have a drinks
trolley go around at five o'clock so I
think I'm going to go and join them for
that because it was George's birthday
and I want to give her a card
hopefully we won't be too drunk on gin I
don't know how much Jim will actually be
like drinking or just like tasting the
weather at the moment is weird it's like
grey and a bit rainy but it's not that
cold I just haven't got back into the
London wardrobe thing yeah I'm not sure
how to dress okay I've done a
last-minute panic change of jacket
because I can't figure out this
temperature tool you ready for some gin
and everybody we are south of the river
which does have to tell me that I had
smartest people on my mouth as a good
start
well it's for today we're actually a
little bit early rich to some reason
freaked out that it would take us like
an hour and a half and it obviously
didn't this looks nice so we're going to
get coffee hat and veil delicatessen
that's really nice I got some olives and
pineapple juice which got me walking
down a little residential road but the
guy who emailed me said don't be fooled
by the residential Road just go keep
going and then you'll find us so they
actually know how big this place is
quick guys were here gotta get that in
stories sighs look how cool this is
we're just waiting for the guy to come
me us I'm guessing that's where they
make sense not there's a separate set so
we've just been learning about how they
make the gym and like hop along major
process and then we tried straight
London Dry tickets like their original
change so nice they're like burners not
so smooth look guys they do a lemon
drizzle gin this is my actual dream hard
Leonard most of all that's so nice on
the back of the button that says the
batch number and then if you go to the
website on the blog if there's what was
happening in the ciliary that day on the
day that your gin was made these are all
different crazy flavors of ginger
Absalom cranberry rose petals
deconstructed martini hydrogen mmm
Indian summer cinnamon Danish bonfires
in mint hi Jim oh my god so we're going
to get a little tasting glasses and then
pour out a little bit to try so as I
told you guys tomorrow's world gin day
and they've got this tips miss cab
they're doing something where you kind
of hail it in social media and then the
cab turns up and serve you in your
friends jeans and it would have already
been by the time this log goes office
tomorrow and Saturday but we're going to
take a little photo by the cab look at
the slip smooth curved black cab that's
so cool user telling us that this is
their logo because if the swan neck is
the shape of the Ducato distillers
distillers stills I mean if your eyes
yeah John guy shop they're so dedicated
to making good gin that they're going to
have to push the cab whoo-hoo turn the
engine off they're pushing it so that
they don't get any fumes inside there
where they're making gin at the moment
look at this dedication to the gin
loving it guys you just left and that
was so good we're a little bit just be
hunger alive but I was so interesting I
love kind of geeky stuff like that very
science II but the people who work there
they're like distillers why are the
girls like you to work social media some
of them are like scientists so someone
just like learn on the job what a cool
job that you make gin I love that and
they gave us the lemon drizzle gene and
London Cup that's why I really like the
London caption that was so great ginger
really so but nice oh not really
yeah good fun they were like one of the
first Jean company to no work just a
word of it yep still in London Rob first
cross because there was a law that stops
you being able to make gin unless it was
a certain amount like a huge quantity
and a bit Smith for two years trying to
get like change the laws and then they
mentally did and now there's loads of
companies making gin in London but they
were the first and it's a niche what a
great way to spend a Friday afternoon
we're going to go to a couple of shops
now and then head to clean I haven't
been in this class central London for
weeks so kind of weird actually they
were quickly because newbie associate
events like soap operas June yes lunch
so early and then we're going to head 55
days at claims I would call it new visa
this UV I love the spicy tuna sushi from
her I got spicy tuna and rich
opportunity bought it in a hand roll
with fetch instead of rice super healthy
I'm so annoyed at myself I completely
forgot to vlog has passed like five
hours we went the game and we had 50
Friday complicated involve anything I
did a wise forgotten to vlog we had gin
more generally a drink and loaded good
chat some we were there hours I suppose
you might hear box I put other stuff but
maybe I'll show you guys and I get home
at this time but now wait for my parents
because they were in town and they're
going to pick us up you've got so many
bags we're going to head to do Shoom I
think in Shoreditch hopefully the queue
is to log in via now so long meeting my
sister some of my parents friends and
then we're going to a gig going to see a
band called young gun Silverhawks and
I've never seen them play live from the
key force between them and yes a night
in East London we're now ensured it and
we're going to head to shoes
we just got home from the geek oh I have
makeup all around my I look like a panda
I was anywhere black liquid liner and
you haven't worn it in ages
I'm feeling very tired and I had some
exciting news today but I do that
annoying thing I'm that person that
turns exciting news into oh my god I'm
so nervous I'm going to crap my pants
and then I never like celebrate the
exciting news because I'm just too
nervous about it so I've been panicking
all night or so I got a comment from
someone on my Lisbon vlog it wasn't a
horrible comment it was very fair
nicely politely written constructive
feedback comment that I very much
appreciated but it like made me think
about things it was she was just saying
that how she really enjoyed my vlogs
like this light is not flattering on me
shiri enjoys my vlogs but she feels like
they used to be they used to be a lot
more like creative with cool shots from
different angles and like time lapses
and stuff and that she filled that by a
little bit like rush now in a bit chatty
like I'm going here I'm going here and
those are the worst type of comments
because I read them and I'm just like
yeah I totally agree and I never want to
be one of those people who does too many
things that everything just becomes bad
quality like a better deal s better
quality than to do lots of things bad
quality and I don't my vlogs to become
boring so at the moment I feel like I've
got a bit too much on to make everything
good with like the podcasts and lots of
other things that I'm taking on it's
hard for me to make my videos as best as
they can be but that comment did make me
want to make my vlogs a bit more
creative so I will try harder and future
vlogs to be a bit more like the vlog for
used to do my evening ramble I feel like
I haven't done much today so I don't
think I'm going to end the vlog here I
think I'll do some more filming tomorrow
some things but there's not much going
on so let's see how exciting I can make
it nice
good morning everyone it is Saturday
morning with sunny season to play nice
today I'm wearing this nice light light
t-shirt shirt from next and we have lots
of like boring errands to do today we're
going to pop to my parents house this
morning then I need to go to Smith toy
shop because I need to buy a badminton
set for a video I've cut coming up that
sounds really random it kind of is and
then we're going to my sisters and I
think I'm just going to like sister
house hop to see all the kids because I
miss them and that's about it for now
peace it's lip balm on my lips is so dry
at my parents house we can't get in

phone that I'm home with all this stuff
that's been sent time parents like
pearbook stuffing I quickly go through
all of it let you know if there's
anything good working some stuff from
Milani which is a brand I always kind of
look at when I go to America a little
 blush oh they're exciting this is
a really lovely girl contacted me I
think this is her company my first years

baby's called which by the way his name
is Rocco and she said that she would
love to make some things for him I'm
going to have a quick peek and then I'll

my sister they will love this go check
out my first years
very very cute stuff if you need buy
presents families just had a baby I also
got certain this beautiful beautiful box

with these gorgeous ribbon see think
this is a collaboration with poppy
Delevingne where our look at these
bottles orange blossom cologne you
neither her two favorites
tuberous angelica cologne intense
there's a very very cheap bottle
there's a baby walker and he's fast
asleep
normally when I told him he described me
so this was really nice is just chilling
very sweet little that just created my
first year thing in there that was
everywhere she let them love them to
show them I shared them already
it's amazing can they want one of my
clothes quite very few breeches turn to
hold the baby oh it's so sweet
eat these little toesies I always would
leave in the car and then have like an
epic nap like I'm so tired that we did
wake up pretty early this morning we
left my sisters c-carly and the kids as
well soren it's at such q age now I'd
like one and he's crawling that was
really weird like leg drank cool thing
inside giggly and sweet we've driven to
specific fields who actual what to do
for lunch we're both clean hungry and I
suggested going to struttin clucks
because I came here with Deb's a few
weeks ago and really really liked it and
I know that rich would like it too I
think it's a great food I had like shot
shooter and
some kinds of things that I'm it's in
East London it's Commercial Street by
smithfield's so we're going to go see if
we can get in there for lunch we finally
found parking space now the walk to
proclaim busy
[Laughter]
so innocent I can't even explain to you
how good through there is like
definitely up there my my top top places
to go in London to eat it's unreal I had
this like Turkish drama with a fried egg
on top
do you enjoy that soup is very bitch I
can't get over it I want to go back to
my country it's definitely difficult
your piano empty you stay for brunch on
Saturday earning it because of Sonny who
it windy which has been trying some
stuff on and in juice or men can never
whole like men jigsaw in centerfield for
the end of a bleep you live in China
guide there are some people who are
lined up reached up with me and they're
just cheering anyone that walks through
for no reason just spread happiness
again
so I'm going to walk through so you guys
I know a little bit about bloody love
London it's a hard word to say just as
rich I really fancy a doughnut so I
googled Brick Lane doughnut and right
across town cafe here
I'm calmly but I didn't know that he's
so excited so we're going again
crosstown donut in a band a band in a
band he's not even joking how great this
is well we've got a whole shop across
town how did I not know that it exists
guys I have all these amazing our
flavors like Kiwi and Apple I'm really
boring and getting raspberry jam they
also have these mini ones and they've
got module date one oh my gosh this
looks so delicious you know have it
we're gonna head back to the car my
mum's obsessed these drinks at the
moment is the rebel kitchen chocolate
and they're made out of coconut milk
instead of white chocolate milk but I
tried hers and a really good it tasted
like chocolate milk so I just picked one
up to have got one French cheese I
haven't vlogged her a little bit because
I'm rich went to do some exercise with
Rob in the park but I went back to see
Jojo again because my friend Deb's
wanted a visit rocker one thing I've
definitely learned from being and auntie
aside from all the baby stuff and like
things I know about giving birth that I
probably shouldn't know and I think this
might be helpful to some of you if some
of your friends are having babies so
like the first time and you're not maybe
used to going around and seeing people
where they just had babies but from what
I know from my sisters is that you get a
lot of visitors and you've just had a
baby and especially if it's your first
baby it's quite overwhelming you've got
enough to deal with like trying to
figure out this whole new like world and
I think sometimes when guests come round
by the way this is not in reference to
Deb's or anyone specific this is about
me when people come around sometimes
they like expect you to make them a cup
of tea or like you're sitting Zepeda the
baby or whatever but when I go around to
see people who've just had babies now I
try and like I haven't bit of a cuddle
with the baby but then I'll try and like
help them tidy up a bit or like we my
sister has helped unload the dishwasher
and then I made Deb's a cup of tea
because I knew that Jojo is like busy
trying to feed the baby so I think
that's what's something to try and think
about like when you go see someone is
just have a baby like yeah it's nice to
see the baby but take them some food or
help unload the dishwasher or make
yourself a cup of tea instead of
expecting them to make you a cup of tea
because they just have the baby so I
think the last thing they want is to
have other people to look after other
than that so cute go have a cuddle with
a baby bit of a random little thought
there why I'm going to go pick up rich I
think we get eaten sushi for dinner
we're just being so lazy on a Saturday
night at client Bloods cooked and we
haven't done like a food shop I think we
need to do it tomorrow for the week I'm
going to pick out some recipes from
Madeline chills cookbook for the week
because that quarry was delicious yes
okay I'm gonna go get him I just got
these pickled radish from the place you
got sushi from and it's so yummy it's
nice to be home which is just showering
because he's been working out he kind of
ordered wrong but let me show you what
we've got for dinner again it's been a
long time since but these logs always
looks like I'm just eating eat anything
I've got miso soup these are pickles I
already ate the other ones in the car
these are pickled cucumbers I got two of
those you've got some salmon to shoot me
she's got salmon and avocado hand-roll
each and needs a spicy tuna Inside Out
roses sesame salmon and avocado inside
that was a sesame and then Richards went
to get one portion of cucumber Maki but
he'll just two portions of avocado
inside out rolls which like much bigger
and really different he covered Maki so
we've basically got a million inside out
rolls but those are lasts till like
tomorrow if you don't eat them so lots
of sushi we going to watch some stuff on
TV I'm going to wash my hair tonight and
I've got my friends hen to plant as well
tonight's job I'm going to sit and come
up with some games hopefully to do our
hem which is like the end of July if I'm
going to end the vlog here so we can
just have a chilled night in together
without filming but I hope you guys have
enjoyed this log and don't forget to
