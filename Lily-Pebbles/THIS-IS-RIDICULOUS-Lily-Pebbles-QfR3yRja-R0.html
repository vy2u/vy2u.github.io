attempt to do a little bit of logging
every single day so around 2 minutes a
days all put into one vlog I'm off to
town to meet Anna
I've got day of meetings and then fun
evening tonight I met a banana and you
come to home slice slice pieces on
Instagram story it's because we've got a
bit of time in between meetings so we're
going to drive I see our nails done I
have had my nails done in a while so I'm
relieving visitor I had a shell accident
Anna made me its person I've ever had it
and I feel like it's going to be
life-changing
now we are heading now we're going up
dinner everybody Lucy Georgia Millie and
Anna goodness and we're going out for
dinner and then we're going to see
Dreamgirls how way it was all Christmas
present for them I had in sorry major
dream down the margins to be her dream
girls are so good I'm home and I'll vlog
again tomorrow I'm starting my day south
of the river
comes to Waterloo and I'm going for
meeting at sea containers which is a
Mondrian Hotel I spent a good six hours
today student England catching up with
work doing emails and lots of diffe
things that was very productive and now
I'm with rich she's come to meet me
after work we are going to restaurant
good sexy fish they have offered us a
tasting menu dinner and I've been there
once before and it was really really
good sushi so I can't wait to go again
and which has ever been there we just
popped into West Elm and I bought all
the things I got a lamp for my office
and I got some amazing linen bed sheets
and duvet cover which my mum always
raised about linen bed sheets so I can't
wait to put them on the bed and go to
sleep
press down holes we infected what have
you affected
making minus 12i our ways are selfies
for you very concrete qualities and that
was so so delicious 12 courses my
favorite was the squid the soft-shell
crab sushi and the dessert they were
like mini doughnuts
cinnamon doughnuts it was so so good I'm
so sleepy now it's been a long day but
it's been a great day so do you remember
a while ago I had really really sore
nets I basically had a reaction to a
safe and glory lipstick and and also to
the toothpaste from Colgate I think it
was because it was a whitening
toothpaste because I've used other
toothpaste from the brand and it's been
fine anyway I had really really sold it
I had like a really dry patch in my eye
I still got it a little bit around my
eyes excuse me but I've got such a
particularly throat today I'm just
eating strepsils
well my lips are kind of cleared up and
they still get a little bit dry but I
went to a dermatologist she gave me some
like cortisone cream and kind of cleared
it up but she insisted I go for an
allergy test to find out what actually
caused the reaction in the first place
so I can try and prevent that happening
again
although I try to explain to her how
awkward it is my job because she said
things like maybe you shouldn't wear
lipstick anymore and that's not really
an option to me so it's quite tricky
because if the results come back that
I'm allergic to something that's in all
make up like my friend Deb's is not sure
how that's going to work with my
lifestyle but we will try and make it
work anyway I'm going for an algae test
today it's a bit like a tricky and
complicated and seeing a guy with dr.
Ian white I have to go today and then I
just go back in two days time and then
back again on Monday all the way in
Waterloo so it's really just dropped in
with my week but I've got to just get it
done
has this booked in for ages I think what
happens as I go there today and he
covers my back in lots of different
different like pricks of different
things and then he sees what I react to
it's me really uncomfortable I can't
really like wash this whole time it's on
my background to try and avoid it not
get it wet I had huge bit of plastic on
my back with cellotape and it's going to
be very uncomfortable and alongside that
and probably going to react to some of
the things that you put on my back so
it'll be really itchy so kind of
dreading that bit anxious but just need
to go and get it done today I am wearing
Giorgio Armani power fabric foundation I
tried it so many times and I feel like
I'm the only person that isn't getting
on with it and it's really frustrating
me because anna loves the foundation and
we usually love the same types of things
that she usually wears really light base
so how'd you love a full coverage
foundation makes me think like oh my god
it must be so nice and not at all cakey
whenever I wear I'm going to come in
really close I don't know if you guys
can see but it really kind of gathers
around my nose and under my eyes and it
just feels really heavy on me I don't
know what it is I feel like I'm the only
person that isn't getting on with this
foundation I've tried it with a wet
sponge try it with a buffing brush today
I used a basi brush and then a wet
sponge so I'm just testing it out but it
just feels a little bit dry on me maybe
my skin's just to dry for it I'm going
to keep trying because I want to love it
too
I'm going to head to Covent Garden
before my allergy test I'm meeting up
with the PR from Kiehl's we're going to
have a coffee and then I'm going to head
over to Waterloo for the test Haloid
test so like I'm going to pass or fail I
don't know I am back home now I went
from my allergy test
you talked through the things I thought
I was allergic to and the ingredients
and then they basically put all these
tiny little dots all over me and they
put a little bit of each kind of
allergen in the dots so they basically
put them all over my back as you can see
there and it also put them on my arms
and like label them so it's pretty
uncomfortable I actually get them taken
off on Friday so I've got two days of
happiness all over me you also pointed
out that I've got two psoriasis on my
body which I've had before
I better get covered in this rash and I
just didn't actually notice I had it
again I don't I'm not really like a
naked person I don't walk around naked
much I also don't look at my own body
very often because I hadn't even noticed
I had it all over my torso so that's
that that's quite annoying and yeah be
interesting to see what happens with
this I'm all taped up and I will let you
guys know I'm feeling quite sad and down
right now because when I got into town
it was the same time that the terrorist
attack happened at Westminster and on a
personal level it was a little bit
frightening being in that part of town
but obviously I'm absolutely fine um
home and
very lucky and there are so many people
who are not lucky and have been terribly
affected by what happened today and it's
just devastating but I'm not going to
discuss terrorism on my youtube channel
so I just want to acknowledge that
something awful happened in London today
and I feel angry and pissed off inside
about it so I will check in back with
you guys tomorrow
I'm really tired today didn't sleep that
well because of all the things that
strapped all over me I'm having a home
day today getting lots of work done and
I think my new West Elm desk is arriving
this morning I can't wait the desk I
have now is from Ikea when we moved into
the flat there were things that we
wanted to spend on and things we wanted
to save on and a desk just wasn't a
priority then so I belonged to Mike here
but it basically just links with a bit
of wood on top so they're not attached
and I'm constantly terrified that add
essence is going to all fall down
everything on it's going to fall so
excited to have a proper desk and I'll
show you in that row the desk arrived
and I'm so excited it's all like wrapped
up I don't know when I'm going to do
this because I probably need Rich's help
so I'm going to do an officer's tour
soon anyways if I don't show you in this
video you'll see it very soon I
completely forgot to vlog tonight the
main ridge went over to my sister
Carly's to babysit and we basically just
sat on the sofa had some curry and a
love chocolate and watching TV we're
home
rich is brushing his teeth and I'll
check in again with you guys tomorrow
cuz I get all that plaque brush it up
all good good morning everyone
it is Friday and today I think I get
these bloody things off my back and I
can't wait today I'm just working from
home I've got sponsored Instagram I need
to do I'm going to write a blog post I'm
going to edit a video it's got quite a
few things wrong with really do you guys
remember when I did that Instagram video
for Revlon well I've just been given the
brief for the next one it's going to go
live in a month's time I think so I'm
now starting to work on the idea and I'm
really excited because I find using
Instagram videos so challenging it's
exactly the same process of filming a
proper YouTube video but you kind of
have to fit everything into one minute
60 seconds max so it's a massive
I find it really exciting I also find it
terrifying and for me the key is all in
the planning of the video so I'm now
starting to think of the idea for the
next one so when you guys see it pop up
on Instagram now so let me know what you
think because the last one went down so
well
rich is working from home today so you
just popped up to get us some munch
which is nice because normally when I'm
alone I just don't eat so what did you
get burrito for coach against Chism
chicken burrito hmm really hungry
haven't had breakfast woops
this is great I'm so annoyed but I went
out and I forgot my camera I'm so sorry
guys but I went all the way to London
Bridge and for the second allergy test
thing and it was so I was in there like
five minutes I can't believe how far I
had to go for five minutes but I went in
and he basically took off all the dots
he left the numbers at the top because
now what we have to do is wait over the
weekend until Monday and kind of let it
brew and see if I react to anything
because obviously sometimes you don't
react straightaway he said there might
not be anything and then we'll sit and
have a chat about what the options are
but I basically can't wash for the whole
weekend
so I'm gonna have to like wash around it
and I've already booked in to get my
hair done tomorrow because I don't know
how I do my hair otherwise
yeah I'm pretty quick it she now now
that he's taking them off and there's
kind of hit them fewer than silk ihe but
I don't know he said nothing like
normally or sometimes you said you can
come see immediately said nothing really
shout out to him so we will see it's
Friday night a manwich is so cool that
we're heading to my parents to have
dinner with them
that's what we do be to try out the
parents all the time we've got my old
desk in the back of the car because
