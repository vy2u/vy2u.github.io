well so recently I filmed a spring
cleaning wardrobe declutter video but I
didn't have any sort of plan to it I
kind of just blocked it and it turned
out to be the longest most boring video
I've ever filmed I was editing it and I
was just like no I wouldn't watch this
so instead I thought I would do a bit of
a sit-down video and after I cleared out
my wardrobe as always what happens after
you do these things as I went on a
little bit of an online shopping haul I
was having like a day at home feeling a
bit unwell and you know when you feel
unwell and you start feeling better or
you want to do is shop yeah that kind of
happened so I bought some things online
so I thought I would turn this into a
bit of a cool slash wardrobe clear out
and just insert some of the clips I
vlogged not everything because you would
literally fall asleep but basically what
I did and what I tend to usually do in
spring and autumn is just go through my
wardrobe
especially because I know we're moving
out soon I just wanted to get rid of
stuff that I'm not wearing I hate the
idea of clothes just sitting in my
wardrobe or sitting in my drawers and
not getting worn like I just don't see
the point the first thing I did is go
through all of my sunglasses I have so
many and I never wear them the only ones
are everywhere and my round
ray-bans so I went through my sunglasses
and got rid of so many of them these
ones from Raven although I think they
are cool they're very similar to my
round ones but I just think they're not
as nice these also from ray-ban I'm
gonna be getting rid of because I don't
like the green color find that they
clash with most of the colors that I
wearing my clothes and if I'm wearing
like a red lip or something like that
just looks a little bit festive these
from ray-ban are really old they're just
a really weird shape they're not the
Wayfarers I'm not even sure what they
are but they don't see me
also these from whistles I absolutely
love these but they don't fit me they
are far too big and they just constantly
fall off my face I wanted for so real
Dior sunglasses so long but actually I
really didn't get much wear out of them
I don't think the shape suits my face at
all makes me look a bit sad I just know
they don't suit me first time I went to
buy the so real
sunglasses they didn't have them I felt
like I kind of got bullied into buying
these because I was too shy to tell the
sells assisted and I didn't love them
anyway it was many years ago and yeah
these also just don't
really suit me these are just crazy
sunglasses from wild fox the uni student
in me always wants to hold on to things
like this in case I need them for fancy
dress but I never do fancy dress anymore
so it definitely need to give these away
so that's one two three four five six
seven sunglasses I also had a few other
items of clothing that I just knew I
wanted to get rid of I'm not sure yet if
I'm gonna sell them on depop or just
give them to friends if I can kind of
get my head around the whole D pop thing
I would definitely try and do that I did
if you guys remember this Topshop blazer
I wore it to beautycon the day that I
crashed my car and I was vlogging for
vlogmas it's like pink and shiny and I
wore a couple of times and then I just
kind of fell out in love with it and
then also this dress from needle and
thread which I bought for my friend's
wedding which I do if you guys remember
me trying it on but I've really
struggled slight lift my arms up in it I
felt like the arms were just kind of
sewed on in a strange way that it wasn't
comfortable it's really embroidered but
also it's very silver and I don't wear
much silver anymore I really like the
shape of it but I just don't get wear
out of it and it's a really nice dress
so someone else could definitely get
much better use out of it and then what
I tend to do is just go through my
entire wardrobe and pull everything out
so I went through all of my hanging tops
all of my hanging houses and then
everything in my drawers as well and
I'll just insert a few of the clips of
the things I decided to keep and things
I started to get rid of this one is a
definite no this is the one from Topshop
I just think it fits really badly
it looks really unflattering around my
boobs it's this weird like stretchy
material which just I don't think it's
it's nice this one's definitely going in
the giveaway pile so now what I've done
is laid out all of my t-shirts and stuff
that were in the drawer over there this
is turning into a burger what's in my
wardrobe because there's not that much
stuff that I'm gonna be getting rid of I
also know I don't need to try them on
I've clearly got a lot of like graphic
tee these ones are gonna be getting rid
of this one I've just had for years I
only wear it for lounging around the
house which I just think is a silly
reason to keep it because I have so many
others this grey t-shirt from and other
stories is just a really sweaty material
this one obviously now I've got the girl
versus cancer one I don't need this as
well
this is from Suzanne I loved this
t-shirt when I got it but it is quite a
tight fit and also the grammar just
drives everyone insane so I think I'm
gonna get rid of that and this one's
from Topshop and I just feel like it's a
bit done in my wardrobe now so I'm
get rid of all of these t-shirts which i
think is quite good I've put some shirts
here a few jumpers my trousers are down
there and then I've got the drawer with
t-shirts and a few jumpers there and
then the jumper jewel which is now very
neat basically in the end I ended up
with three massive piles of things to
give away
not necessarily stuff I dislike just
stuff that I'm not really getting enough
wear out of
I think it go to bed of homes and it
kind of frees up some space in my
wardrobe as well
I also reorganized my drawers folded
everything really nicely and yeah I just
love a good wardrobe spring clean so as
I said I did a bit of online shopping I
bought some stuff from Topshop and I
never usually shot for Topshop online so
this will be interesting I also bought
some stuff from ASOS and a few of the
items I had to order in two sizes which
sometimes I do I order like 10 and a 12
and then try on and send back the one
that doesn't fit people always ask me
about my size which is kind of weird but
people always like know where you're at
10 I'm a 10 on a good day I'm 5 foot 7 I
have big boobs
I've got big hips as well so I'm really
happy if I'm a 10 but sometimes I'm at
12 I really like wearing quite oversized
clothes so that's fine I was in and
other stories last week and I tried on a
top in a 14 and a dress in an 8 so I
really just don't care about sizes or
look at them for me it's just how I look
what I look in the mirror and how I feel
when I'm wearing clothes that's kind of
what's most important sizes are so
different in every shop so I wouldn't
get too hung up on that but that's why
sometimes I have to order a few
different sizes so I think I'll start
with the ASOS stuff and I don't usually
do these kind of holes where I'm
literally opening it on camera and
whenever I watch other people's holes
like this is always funny because
they're like I love this table it looks
so nice and then they insert a clip for
them trying on and they're like no it is
not nice
and I always think it's quite funny that
you don't know what it'll look like so I
will talk you through each item but
until I try them on I will not know if
they're nice or not and I might end up
hating it all it's very likely knowing
me also that would be great for my bank
account if I do hate people so I'm just
gonna rip open this Asus one see what's
inside so I clip out here ooh
earrings these are from whistles I think
but they came in a little ASOS package
they're not from whistles I'm gonna be
linking everything down below in the
description box so open that up and
check for the links I thought these
would be really pretty and I don't
change my earrings that often I get so
many questions about where these bar
earrings are from and I think they were
all of a bonus actually and the rest
that all kind of Maria Tosh and I just
leave those in but I like the option of
changing these first ones so I ordered
these from whistles and they're
basically like little hanging Leafs I
just thought that would be really pretty
they're not too big they're not too
small I won't do little like cutaway for
you because that's what they look like
I'm pretty sure I'll end up keeping
those cells on here that those were 19
pounds which isn't too bad okay next up
is a bit of a wild car then I always end
up with these an idea on my 15 because
in the sort of things that I would take
into a dressing room a changing room to
try on in a shop and be like mmm but
when you're online shopping you just
don't know I'm always very good with
ASUS returns I like to keep them all in
their plastic packaging but apparently
you don't actually have to pretty sure
this is from yeah this is a sauce own
brand it's yellow
white and black I'm just so into yellow
at the moment everyone is it's a massive
trend color for this season
first impressions are the material feels
a little bit like cheap and sweaty but I
just thought it's quite thin that's
definitely gonna be see-through as well
don't like see-through clothes but I'm
gonna try it on I think maybe tucked
into jeans I like that it's got this tie
front I think that could be cool I
actually think I quite like this it's
maybe not something that I would have in
my wardrobe forever but as a trend piece
I think it's quite a nice I think this
little detailing is nice for myself body
shape I'm probably not wearing the right
genes for I'd probably wear something a
bit tighter and maybe black jeans but I
think the stripe is just a little bit
interesting and different and the
material feels liked weight quite easy
to wear this boob looks a bit big which
I don't know about that but I think my
initial feelings are that I quite like
it okay next up oh so excited I got
these in two sizes when I open this up
and show you you everyone seems to be
wearing mark told me what this is called
in the weekend the shacket I think it's
like a mixed scene a shirt and a jacket
and I think that's what this is because
it's kind of like corduroy material it's
orange very into my color at the moment
and it looks like a shirt but it's kind
of thick enough that you can wear it
like a jacket I would add this at a 12
as well because I thought you actually
could look really cool over size but I
didn't want it to be too big and I just
never know so I think that would look
really nice over like a little t-shirt
or something and jeans like pop of color
really love the orange excited to see
what that looks like on this is the
socket and I really loved the color I
think it's a very relaxed style actually
what size is this I didn't even check
this is the 10 so I'll probably try on
the 12 just to be safe but I reckon this
is oversized enough that I don't think
it needs to go bigger than this I think
it's really cool I think it's very much
like a weekend style with jeans but I
think I'm quite into it my friend Deb's
coming over later so maybe I'll ask our
house best to style it but think I'm
gonna keep it this is the 12 actually I
really like the 12 as well I think maybe
it makes even more of a statement I'm
gonna try on both again later and just
have a little look there's not much
difference but I think maybe it needs to
be quite oversized but I definitely love
the color I think it looks really cool
okay next oh I have no idea what this
one's gonna look like but it's a boiler
suit again just Asus own brand got it in
two sizes they don't have many boiler
suits on the website and I wasn't
massively fond of this color I really
liked the color but I think it could
really wash me out so that's my worry
also the material that feels like very
sweaty and jumpsuits and boiler suits
you do not want to get sweaty in because
you will get a sweaty bum crack not
gonna lie so kind of weird thin feels a
bit like polyester II I don't know what
it's actually made from but it's a
boiler suit short sleeve so it's got
this like pockets it's got big pockets
on the front button down and then it's
wide leg which I just thought would be
really cool I think I'd get too sweaty
in the crotch sorry for TMI but it's
just so true
also I think this would get very creased
so I'll try it on but I don't think that
one would be a winner if you guys know
of any like boiler suits that are made
from nice material maybe like a linen
actually that is what I'm on the lookout
for this is the boiler suit and it's
made me realize that I definitely like
the idea of a wide-leg boiler suit and I
really want to try find another one but
for me the material for the
one isn't right I would be very worried
about sweat marks on it and it's just so
Creasy as well I definitely think I want
one in a bit of a thicker material but I
really like the style of this kind of
like shirt front it's got one button
then a little bit of a zip short sleeves
I think this is really cool and I think
because I'm tall I can kind of get away
with it so that's everything from ASOS I
didn't go too wild now let's open up the
Topshop order alright the first thing I
got again in two sizes is a white shirt
and we take off the plastic packaging I
think I saw this in Suzie's fall and
I've been looking for a white shirt for
so long I really like the look of white
shirts like tucked into jeans but it's
really hard to find the right one I find
that a lot of shirts are just too stiff
this feels really nice it's got the kind
of drop shoulder thing which I don't
love but it does give it a nice kind of
casual feel it's got these like
tortoiseshell buttons and a big pocket I
think this I think I'm really gonna like
this actually so I got that again in the
10 and a 12 I'm gonna try on both
probably tucked into jeans a cy thing
this is the white shirt and I think it's
really nice this is actually 410 and I
think it's big enough is a little bit
see-through but I think with a nude bra
it's okay
it's nice untucked for a more relaxed
look and then you could also tuck it in
I really like it I really like like the
material actually because it's a sort of
material I think increase and it would
look like it's meant to be creased and
that's fine I'm so happy I finally found
a white sure that I like so thank you
seriously for putting this in your haul
ooh this is nice so I've got this top in
white already so I saw this on the
website and I know that the style is
gonna suit me really nice with
high-waisted jeans or trousers
I feel like the material of this one is
different it's a bit thicker I don't let
me see if I can see what it's made from
yeah it's got 12 percent linen in it so
that's why it's a little bit thicker and
it won't crease as easily so I really
like this I would definitely look into
other colors as well but again this is
like a mustard a yellow which I think
will look really nice and quite like
seventies vibes
I knew I'd like this one I just really
love the shape of these tops at the way
the buttons go to the side it's got a
little pocket and I love the color
I think yellow goes so well with blue
and I wear blue denim all the time the
sleeves are long enough that it's
flattering if you like don't love the
tops of your arms or whatever and it's a
really perfect length as well it's not
too cropped and it's not too long don't
have to tuck it
in it fools kind of just below where the
jeans kind of come up to really really
like this top definitely gonna look into
what other colors they have because I
feel like this will be my like spring
summer staple top I saw this on the top
shop website think Susie might feature
this as well sorry Susie and basically
just like coffee in your home this is
one of those ones that I was like I know
it won't suit me I just know it won't
but I really wanted to try it I just
think I just want the opportunity to try
it this is not gonna suit my body shape
because I have big boobs but I just
likes the kind of peplum style of it so
I've sort be really cute in summary
there's little straps and then it's kind
of stretchy of the boobs which I am
gonna hate I know I am but then I like
how it kind of goes out it just looks so
nice and Susy but I know it won't sue me
but I'm gonna try we'll see I really
like the red and white like gingham
picnic table print I don't know how I
feel about this top because there are
elements I like and elements that I
don't like so I really love this peplum
style of me because my tummy is my least
favorite part I feel like it really
flatters it kind of goes in at the small
bit and then goes out a little bit but
it's short enough that you still wear at
jeans I don't hate this part as much as
I thought I would if anything it kind of
like straps my boobs in and makes them
feel a bit smaller which I am really
into these sort of straps
I don't think suit me they're sort of
straight down straight across thing it
would have been kind of more flattering
to be it a slight V or a slight
halterneck I'm quite bored so I don't
think this style straight-across suits
me but I think like as a whole it's
quite a cute summery top knot with these
jeans I think I'd need to wear tighter
jeans really don't know about this top
again I think I'm just gonna have to
show my friend when she comes over later
and see what she thinks it's probably
gonna be a no but it might be yes all
these feel really soft
these are tracksuit bottoms but I
thought the idea of them for me is I can
kind of wear them out maybe they're
black they are very soft and they've got
one white stripe going down the side Oh
Landro for life my fav it's just my fav
comfy clothes but I thought these would
look nice working from home or like
running errands or traveling which I'm
not really doing much of I tried on the
12 in these first because I'm tall and
these are definitely the right size for
me but you know how I feel about them
because on one hand they're so
comfortable and soft but in the other
they're really quite unflattering
because there's such thin material they
cling to everything and you definitely
have to wear a thong with them which I'm
just not a fan of especially if I'm
wanting to be comfortable and like
lounging so I don't know actually I
should look at how much these are
they're 22 pounds so I think the
question is whether I want them just to
lounge around the house in and be comfy
because I probably wouldn't wear these
out I'm gonna have to have a think but I
think if you've got a really great
figure and you feel really comfortable
like wearing a thong and you maybe
aren't as hippy as me these would be
really nice because they're so soft
they're so comfortable oh yeah this look
nice oh I think this is gonna be nice
this is like a black shirt it's got that
kind of tuxedo front so it's quite low
and then it's got two double breasted
buttons and loose arms I just thought
it's a little bit sure that would look
really nice tucked into jeans very
excited to try that one oh no how
annoying that I'm liking everything but
this top I really like it it's so
different for a shirt I love that it's
got the the four button so you can't
really see cuz the light's not great
here I love that it's shorter sleeve so
it's a bit more like a casual summer
version of a shirts on my shirts are
just quite wintery I love this V again
this is a sort of shirt collar that
really suits me rather than a high
collar that's quite like stiff there's
more relaxed collar suits me I love that
it's short so you can wear it with
high-waisted jeans but it's still quite
loose as well it's not like a crop top
and it's kind of smart as well love this
so much okay the final item from Topshop
it is red oh yeah this is a summer dress
so the one holiday that I've got planned
this year so far maybe at all I'm not
sure is at the end of May and I thought
this dress would be just really nice for
like by the pool
it's got spaghetti straps which I would
never normally wear but like when I'm by
the pool it would and it's got a little
buttons and it's just it's just really
loose and easy it's just like a little
beach dress and I feel like that's
something I can just wear every year you
know it's like summer clothes you just
have them under your bed and you wear
the same ones
every year sometimes I just need to
refresh my stock a little bit and that's
what I thought this would do I probably
have a bikini on underneath this rather
than a broad but I knew this would be
fine it's just such a lovely beach
kind of pool dress very easy lightweight
I quite like the little frills and so
you can definitely see my underwear
under here but really comfortable love
it and I love the color I've also got
one item here from and other stories
that I want to show you guys just for
transparency I didn't buy this and other
stories have been very kind at the
moment and sending lots of lovely stuff
to bloggers and I'm very lucky to be
included in that group and I've just
been loving their clothes so I've got
some more things arriving this week and
if they come in time I try and like film
on another day and add those in as well
but if they don't I'll show you another
time but this came last month and I
absolutely love it it's a silk shirt and
it's got buttons down the front it's
that same style which I really like and
it's got pockets as well so it looks a
bit like a jacket but it's a shirt it's
got this kind of subtle pinstripe and I
absolutely love this I will show you
what it looks like on oh isn't this
shirt just dreamy I love that it looks
like posh pajamas I've actually also
ordered the matching trousers which I
don't know how they will look but on the
website the girls wearing this shirt
tucked into the trousers and it looks
like she's wearing pajamas and I kind of
like it so I'm gonna try those on but
for now I just love the shirt I love the
weight of it it's really quite heavy so
it hangs really nicely I think it just
looks really cool I can't wait to wear
this so that is everything from my haul
I really hope you guys enjoyed seeing me
try them on talk a little bit about my
wardrobe clear out let me know if you
