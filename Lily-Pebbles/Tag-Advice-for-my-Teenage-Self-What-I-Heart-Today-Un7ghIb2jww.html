video i was tagged by flare from
fleurdeforce to do the advice for my
teenage self tag which I actually think
it's quite funny oh so there's basically
a list of questions I go through and
give advice to myself as a teenager I'm
not going to count like 17 18 19 because
I think I was pretty much the same as i
am now then and kind of different well i
think of teenagers i think like 13 14 15
16 that's like teenage days um so yeah
I'm going to get started the first
question is three makeup or fashion do's
flattering clothes where flattering
clothes I had it all wrong I think you
have to like assess your body shape and
then wear clothes to suit you I had it
all backwards these days I wear tights
skinny trousers and loose tops because
that suits my body shape when I was a
teenager I ward like the bag eous jeans
and trousers ever and then the tightest
little vest top that was like cropped
and it was awful and when I look back at
photos it's just awful so Lily look in
the mirror look at your body shape and
wear clothes suit you not clothes that
don't suit you number two this isn't
quite makeup is definitely
beauty-related where your friggin
retainer I had braces for three years
three and a half years and it fixed my
teeth I had awful awful teeth but then I
didn't wear my retainer like a stupid
idiot and then they kind of just went
back right my bottom teeth are all
messed up now and they're just not as
good as they could have been and I
should have just worn the retainer
because it would have just made them
straight and I was just lazy and I just
didn't like it and i really regret it so
number two wear your retainer number
three just wash your face I don't know
why but I just never used to like wash
my face obviously a shower would have
had bars and stuff but I just use face
wipes and i think was like simple face
wipes and they're just so bad for your
skin is strip your skin and I just
remember my mom always been like here
he's try my cleanser you
and I just could never be bothered again
just lazy teenager just throw the face
wipes away and just wash your face with
good old water and soap and a muslin
cloth flannel anything oh my poor skin
and all those face wipes the same
question it's three makeup and fashion
don'ts oh my god I have so many more
than three but I just need to pray get
down to three the first one is stopped
wearing black eyeliner in the inside of
your I used to wear it all the way along
the waterline and it's just not good for
my eye shape I've got quite small eyes
I'd have small eyes but when I went
black eye on it makes them look tiny and
makes the whole eyes disappear and it's
awful and it just looks awful and all
the photos were awful so just stop
wearing black eyeliner it's not cool
you're not cool stop it the second one
is don't wear Buffalo's I don't know if
any of you know what buffaloes are
google them they're these horrendous
shoes i think the Spice Girls warband
that's probably how I going to them I
had about four pairs and they're just
massive massive platform they're
probably like trendy now but I don't
care they look awful I've got really
skinny ankles so I just look like I had
this massive like elephant feet clunking
around I was also at the time now I
think if I was caught up with me but
when I was at school I was like the
tallest in the class and buffalo and
shoes that are like that high just makes
you even taller and I just looked like a
gangly tree and it was awful stop
wearing buffalos they're not cool either
and they're just awful number three
don't wear UFOs or jungles I don't know
this is another thing I've done if I was
gonna know they all I know my friends
will jungles and UFOs at both kind of
brands of trousers I think they were
started for dancers they're like those
massive kind of combat style trousers
the UFOs I had them in fluorescent pink
neon pink and they had all these dangly
bits hanging off them and jungles I had
been black ink are green and I used to
do dance lessons so to fire one to dance
but I will them all the time even when I
wasn't dancing big baggy trousers and a
little vest top and I'm not Jackie they
were so baggy a little house where
parachute awful teenage me please stop
wearing UFOs and jungle trousers they're
really awful oh my gosh I think they
were really expensive that is like my
most fashion the worst fashion thing
I've ever done so the next one is I'm
just reading my phone case I you wonder
why I keep looking down deep and
meaningful piece of advice for yourself
um I think I don't know I think I'm not
right deep and meaningful person I think
just enjoy being young I was always a
bit more mature than my friends I think
it's because I've got two older sisters
in like their like 10 years and seven
years older than me so I've always been
around kind of older people my best
friends are like year above me and I was
always kind of the more mature one who
didn't really get involved with like the
silly stuff and I don't regret it I
think if I can give advice to myself
just like enjoy being young and being
silly and don't like roll your eyes at
people who are being stupid because it's
fun and just kind of enjoy it and you'd
have to grow up so quickly really
because when you grow up it's really
boring so stay young and fun the next
question is one tip for school um first
one's going to just take more risks I
always kind of took the easy route at
school and actually turned out not to be
easy but I just went for the subjects
that I thought I was good at you know I
did art music drama all the things
creative things they actually turned out
to be much harder because you have
actually have to be really good at them
to do them but I always try to take the
easy route and I think I should have
taken risks you know I didn't do history
or geography on any of the harder
subjects that even though i may have
like failed in them and I just think I
shouldn't have worried so much about
failing and actually giving it a go and
try to do it which kind of leads on to
my second tip for school stop being such
a no all I wasn't like him know all but
I always had a question whenever the
teacher was you know doing the class I
was always the one who put my hand up
with a question and at the time it used
to drive me mad they'd send me out of
class for being structive when I was
just asking a question but now I see you
know if you keep going on asking
questions or drive me mad too so Lily
stop being an hour
and just sit and try and learn and
concentrate and just use school for what
it's for the next question is one tip
for friends um I don't know I think I
was alright with friends at school I had
like a really close best friends out of
school and I had some friends in school
um maybe my tip would be just don't
worry about like gossip and stuff that's
going on don't worry about because she's
not talking to me because I borrowed her
panel she's not talking to me because
her boyfriend kissed his boyfriend I'm
not his movement her boyfriend whatever
just don't worry there's so much like
gossip stuff with friends at school and
it's so boring I think I did stay out of
it quite well but it probably deep down
still kind of got to me and so just
don't worry about all that rubbish
because it doesn't mean anything the
friends that stay friends forever like
all that just gets forgotten about so
just kind of enjoy your friends really
um and one tip fun I don't know this one
means but I guess my tip would be have
some have more fun just be more happy
less money gosh I've owned throughout my
whole teenage life stop moaning just
have fun that would be my tip fun have
it so that's the tag um it's quite fun I
didn't if you guys found it interesting
