my New York vlog I woke up this morning
casually turned over looked at my phone
and had like a million notifications and
I couldn't understand why and then I
remembered that I'm a new magazine today
I went to do like a photo shoot with
them and interview I just thought it
would be like a little thing than one
page
I won the bloody cover feeling really
freaked out about it and kind of can't
regulate my breathing but it's very
exciting my mom's getting phone calls
from her friends congratulating her so
that's really nice and we're gonna go
and see if we can find one in New York
but we're actually leaving Keisha's
apartment today we're going to citizen M
hotel in Times Square and we're gonna be
staying there for two nights so we're
gonna head there now check-in me up with
Keisha
go to Soho find a new magazine and
that's pretty much it all day and I'm
thinking about wearing a hat so excuse
me while I look like a farmer so we just
got to our hotel but it's a little bit
too early to check-in so we're gonna
grab the propolis but look how cool is
look at this is the lovely one up at the
mirror this
and then I love this they're gonna be
but working people
very cool hotel very good I would like
to see the room we just had breakfast at
the Bowery Hotel a place called Gemma
which is funny and it's that soft-boiled
eggs is really nice that floats a
blogger because I was so hungry and
Ellen Page sat next door is like from
Juno that's pretty cool which is like
really cool person I where we going yeah
so now we're gonna go find the fight
beauty lab and the glossy a pop pop shop
and Keisha is gonna come meet us here
mice breakfast really yummy so far it's
really kind of hmm so I think we've been
into Whole Foods every day so far in
this trip and this is basically my view
of the holiday is walking behind Gemma
around Whole Foods and then we normally
end up here where the nuts are he needs
to know that this cinnamon in home
and I was no sugar because cinnamon
incredible
we found brandy melville and it was
really cheap so we bought stuff and
Gemma there's your bag we found a
Birchbox store they sell on the eShop
put into like categories at skincare
makeup and you can make a little birch
box at the back we found the bite lip
lab let's go in that was a massive shape
we found the bike lip lab and look
really cool you may see sit down and
have a consultation and you make your
like perfect lip shade and they make the
lipstick then in there so even that
expensive but so we were standing there
for a while like waiting our turn and
she was like yeah there's a massive
waiting list it's booked up all day so
next enough yeah we thought we were next
in line so I'm really gutted and we're
not really good we put our name down but
I doubt they're gonna kill us so as a
massive shame if you do want to go with
a better book we didn't so yeah it's
really annoying so we just stumbled
across Kate's page different line cuz
we've stumbled
oh okay we just found Kate Spade
Saturday which we didn't know what it
was and Jemma started lying and
pretending it was like a cheap arranged
but actually was it was like a noose
brand fur like if you can't quite for
Kate Spade and it's cool and it's like
bright yellow and it was fun go there I
recommend it yeah I'm just waiting
Vicky's shirts turn up I think she's
about to turn the corner
and we kindled our love
I'm really happy so now we're going to
find gamma shop to my shops and then
we're gonna say him have a ketchup and
some juice and thirsty time pouch
her eyes are trying to find the glossy a
pop-up and we're in this random place it
doesn't look like a very exciting thing
where's one two three four guys I read
this at 13 seconds I'm like yeah you'll
be open then I just read down here I
think it's closed an hour into the
glosses office I'm so happy that we
found it look
if I could since moisturizer really
looking forward to trying my bits plus
you should just go back to the hotel and
I'm gonna wash my hair finally and then
we're gonna have some drinks tonight and
head out for sushi so in citizen M Hotel
is really cool the going on stairs was
so friendly and our room is like it's
really cute and small and new yorky but
it has this like really high bed here
with it it comes with a Keisha on the
bed which is even more cool you're
really color-coordinated right now it's
like red yeah everything and that says
citizen M welcome citizen Lilly and

nails okay so at the moment the color is

pillows citizen M no I will win in a
pillow fight no I will it's makeup time

I think my advice for us because I'm
struggling to find a solid day's other
direction
no we're not going buyer we're gonna
detour guys Oscar Blandi is no more they
just don't do it or anymore only the
travel mini
so we're back at the hotel now and it's
so and I spending a day with Keyshia
we're gonna see her again tomorrow and
I'm not really sure what our plans after
tomorrow but I'm sure it'll be a lovely
day again in New York that I'm really
excited to sleep in this bed because
American beds are the comfiest ever so
it's huge so I'm going to get into bed
edit my video and have a good night's
sleep I have to vlog again what just
happened I went to collect it sorry
excuse me can I just wipe my own so
basically we need more towels so we had
a phone down and got towels normal thing
 and she came to the top right here
tells freshly-baked I'm literally gonna
have the best night I can't control more
than one camera at a time this is what
I've realized I woke up this morning and
filmed the whole video and I probably
should have looked by now but I
completely forgot when I'm taking photos
or filming a video
I always forget to vlog I'm not good at
multitasking but I've just filmed a
whole video it was very hard in this
room I mean look at this amazing view
it's amazing but I can't film with that
in the background because the light is
just too dark so I've had to film kind
of this throw round this is our room but
it's bit of a mess and I'd like pulled
this sheet across and look nice but I
think the light was a pink whatever I
know you guys just want to see what I
thought you don't really mind about the
quality so I'm just kind of importing
all those files now waiting for Germans
get back from her CrossFit session and
then we're gonna have breakfast in the
hotel because it looks really yummy
breakfast a service at 11:00 is 10:00
hopefully we don't miss it
and then we're gonna have another fun
day out but I'm gonna be Gemma
downstairs for breakfast
who are we heading first panting hate
balls
- where're you taking us Oh
that's my girlfriend okay where we going
Argo teeth are goatee mother chuckling
chai tea
I don't like chai chai chai
my favorite a minute all up something
else
we thought I better update you guys
because I may have just bought something
and I've already filmed back in the
video so I thought I should show you I
went back and they got the trainer's
that I wanted same ones that Jenna got
flying it Luna to
just to learn everyday niceness they do
half sizes here
we found an Irish kitchen which was on
Gemma's list of places to go it was
really nice we had nice food and drinks
for the lady was pretty rude to Jenna
because she was in a cappuccino with
froth on it
please okay sorry lady if you're seeing
this sorry
let's but apart from that before there's
drama it was great
walking through the back streets of
Greenwich Village yeah looks really cool
I feel like this is proper New York and
really liked it around here think it's
my favorite part of New York oh my god
how many times I said the word favor and
these logs
if only you could say favor probably the
least favorite to favorite this favorite
we found the water
after many sunsets are these kind of
walk in every school
it's really nice
delicious mozzarella
priority is called the Gans of walk
market it only opened a week ago so if
you're in the Meatpacking District calm
down and check it out it's really cool
so we're back at the hotel now and we
didn't end up eating in Chelsea Market
it was really nice to walk around but
there wasn't really anywhere to sit so
we went next door to oh I knew I'd
forget the name Pakistan Pakistan Babu :
Babu can uh I wouldn't know when I came
here at Birchbox it is delicious we just
sat in the bar area quite children had
like amazing delicious delicious food
and then we got a cab back here and I
thought I'd show you guys what I bought
today because as I said I've already
filmed my whole video so these won't be
in there that's coming up that's gonna
be up on Sunday so these are some extra
bits I'll show you I got these two socks
for American Eagle they do they're like
sleep range which is airing and these
are like long cozy oh they're really
good and it was - it was one for ten or
two for 15 so it was worth going
downstairs to get the other pair I also
got from brandy melville show you this
stripy t-shirt
I love stripes and I love wearing
t-shirts that's a great combination and
this sweater
oh my toe is stopped me too which is
just like a really kind of SH limp v
gray easy cozy jumper and then we found
like a grocery store and I found fruit
roll-ups us-uk people love fruit
roll-ups roll they roll and a free roll
that's one for me one for my sister
maple chewing gum very exciting peanut
butter amends for my sister Carly and
Reese's Peanut cups for Carly as well I
think I was at my end my vlog here
because tomorrow why tomorrow
they were gonna just have like a chilled
eggs or fly hands right and yeah we're
gonna touch them like nice chilled lunch
and really go to ground zero as well but
just to let you guys know but I think
you're probably wondering by now it's
four days later and all we've done is
shop and eaten
we've both been to New York loads of
times before so that's why we haven't
done like touristy stuff but I think
tomorrow we are going to do a few
touristy things but I'm gonna vlog
because I've been blood blood vlogging
for four days now I'm pretty tired and
yeah it's mostly me chill day so I hope
you guys have enjoyed my New York vlogs
and check back on Sunday for my haul
video which I filmed right here in this
room it was difficult but it came out
alright I think I hope and I'll see you
guys then
