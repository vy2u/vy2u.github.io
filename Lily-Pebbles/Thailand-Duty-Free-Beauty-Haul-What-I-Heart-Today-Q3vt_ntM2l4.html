the most amazing time I got back last
Thursday night but since then I've
literally been manic busy if you follow
me on Twitter Instagram you'll know I've
been doing London Fashion Week with
L'Oreal professional going to all their
shows backstage and sort of reporting
the hair looks for them on their blog so
I got back Thursday night and then
Friday morning I started or Friday
afternoon and then since then it's been
like leaving my house at 7 in the
morning getting back at like 8:00 and
night so it's been pretty crazy and I
promise I did have a tan it's kind of
faded with all the stress and tiredness
and very jet-lagged and tired from the
Fashion Week stuff and it's really sunny
today which is nice but it means that
it's quite bright light in here so I
promise I'm more tired than I look had a
really amazing time in Thailand I did
take some sort of video clips when I was
there I didn't vlog but I filmed kind of
every where we were going so I'm gonna
try and edit that together I just had to
find music to go with it because quite
hard to find music for YouTube and I
don't anything annoying that's gonna get
on your nerves so I'm going to try and
do that that will be up at some point
and loads of people have requested a
video need like talking through my trip
and how I booked things and where we
went and where we stayed so let me know
if you guys are interested in something
like that because I think it might be
boring for a lot of people but those
people said they're planning trip to
Thailand so let me know I can always
kind of do a little vlog thing on that
but yeah this video is gonna be on the
stuff I bought in Thailand and in their
port duty-free I wasn't planning on kind
of buying poochy stuff and I was there
wasn't that kind of holiday but I
realized actually that Thailand do a lot
of really cool like face masks and stuff
so I gradually towards the end of the
holiday bought quite a few bits I don't
want to offend anyone
I don't think all these products a type
I'm not entirely sure where they're form
some might be Chinese or Japanese and
I'm sorry that I just don't know and a
lot of the products don't even have
English on them so I'm not going to be
able to tell you much about them I
haven't used
yes so it's more just showing you what
I've got and I'm sure you guys will know
a lot of the products so let me know if
you've used them and what you think and
stuff so I'm gonna start with things I
bought in Watson's and what's things
like Pharmacy in Thailand they do have
boots like like you guys told me but
only mini in Bangkok and I went to the
small islands where they don't have
anything like that but it's Bangkok
there's Watson's
so I popped in there I got a lot of face
Moss because they do those really well
the first two I bought I don't think
these are Thai oh actually yes I think
they are because it's got Thai writing
on the back they're from the brand of my
beauty diary and they look like this I
got one which is the Japanese cherry
blossom mask which is for refreshing and
restoring and this one is the red vine
mask even it's got picture of red wine
it says very divine and this is
nourishing and revitalizing and their
common kind of boxes actually I haven't
opened these I want to see what they
look like inside okay that was really
hard to get in see but so they're in a
little box I always see it so there's
just two in there and they come on like
little packets and they feel squidgy so
I've no idea I think they're like sheep
mask I think most kind of the Asian
masks are like sheep asks so but two of
the tribe awesome turret of red wine and
then I also got a few other masks from
Watson's I got two of the Watson's own
brand moisturizing facial masks
with cucumber extract so this is for
firming and moisturizing enriched with
natural collagen I had to make sure to
avoid I neither said brightening or
whitening or whitening mainly because
there's a lot of products to kind of
white in the skin Thai people love to
make their skin whites it's so funny
it's like complete opposite of us and we
go there to try and like turn up and
they have like umbrellas to stay out of
the Sun which I think it's very funny
but yeah these look really nice I like
kind of cucumber products they're really
refreshing and then another mask the
last mask from Watson's is the
antioxidant facial mask and it's the
green tea one which looks really nice I
don't think this is Thai and the reason
I think there's
some of the products have a sticker on
the back with Thai writing like
translated into ice that's what makes me
think the products not time but let me
know and feel you guys will know I think
that might be like Chinese wasn't me but
yeah this looks really nice as well like
the sound of a green tea mask also when
I was in Watsons I saw they have like
they the Maybelline counters and stuff
and I saw that they had baby lips
but I'm very confused by this okay so I
was like wow baby lips they don't have
these in the UK yes I won't know it mad
and I bought four I think this one the
blue and orange is just kind of plain
and then there's like the three color
ones which berry crush I don't know what
that flavor is the labels covering it
Rose addicts and eyes are excited by
these but then I kind of looked into it
a bit more and I'm not sure fees that
like the proper baby lips or if they're
the real ones I don't really know
they're really small they look small
compared to like the ones that I've seen
other youtubers talk about online and
they're really crap if I'm honest it
just kind of like a lip balm it's like
chapstick so I don't really understand
like if these are the real baby lips
that I don't get the fuss at all and I'm
really annoyed that I bought four but
then maybe or not they look really small
they're basically the same size as a
chapstick so let me know if these are
like the proper baby lips or not I'm
very confused and then the last thing I
got from what since is this mascara and
this was hanging next to the djv butan
Iser which is a mascara i got from cult
ec that I absolutely love it's
incredible it's Caroline herrings
favorite mascara ever and it really is
great and this is hanging next to it and
I just assumed it was djv so I haven't
got that one it's called lash knockout
but then I just took it out and it says
deja vu
laughs knockout so I don't know if
that's the same brand let me know if you
guys know I think this is also a tie oh
no it might not be tired that's not tire
on the front hasn't got tire on the
front it's got tie in the back so I'm
not sure who that might be
I don't know I'm not gonna guess I don't
know went from anyway I always like
trying mascara is this is called the
date IV lash knockout and it looks good
so I'm gonna try that that's everything
from Watson
and then I also went into Tokyo which is
like one of their kind of John Lewis
type department stores and they had a
majolica majorca as I said yeah stand
and missglamorazzi Ingrid from is Lamar
as he always talks about majolica
majorca I've always wanted to try it but
it's pretty much impossible to get here
I don't think there's a Thai brand
either but you can get it in Thailand so
I was looking at mascaras if they're
meant to be really good and I just kind
of asked her which one is best for
volume and length and I looked at all
the different brushes and this one
looked like the best for me and it's
called the lash King it's got the most
ridiculous like packaging ever and like
something like this here I would never
buy it looks so cheap but I've heard
great things and it's don't think is a
cheap for a full Thailand it's actually
like one of the kind of higher in the
scar as I think so yeah I'm really
excited to try that as well Touma Sora's
got a bit mascara crazy and then the
last place I went was beauty buffet and
this was recommended on my Instagram I
asked you guys like where I should go in
there was so many recommendations so
thank you so much but we went to this
big shopping mall in Bangkok rmk or
something like that comment what it's
called and it's huge it was like 500
floors no seriously it was like 10
floors and like we just got so lost so I
couldn't actually I've definitely didn't
go to all the beauty stores but I walked
past Beauty buffet and I was like
someone told me to go there
so I popped in there and it's really
cute it looks like a kind of candy
bakery kind of place and its really fun
and nice decorates and their staff are
really nice as well so there's a brand
in there called Gino McCray and that's
like one of the brands I said I think is
like the main work
sorry my hair is annoying me let me get
it on my face don't you were commenting
saying stop touching your hair and okay
done
so yeah Gino McCray it's one of the
brands I sell there and the stuff looks
really nice I think she made she made
like a famous makeup artist or something
I'm not sure the first thing I got with
these cotton pads it sounds weird but I
love trying things like this like I
heard Mike
he's come a standard cotton pad so since
I mean this is a bit different how
exciting
so silky soft makeup cotton and they're
basically just like little pads but then
it's really soft and nice to use and
they weren't expensive so I just bought
a packet of these it just says ideal for
makeup removal and cleansing nails and
anything really and they're kind of like
little squares I think so that's cool
also from that brand
I bought the grapeseed oil Pro makeup
deep cleansing oil now I know Asian
cleansing oils are really good I've
tried the DHC one which I really really
liked so I wanted to try it up hands and
oil I saw one and what's and didn't get
it and then I kind of regretted it so
I'm glad I found this one if there is
infused with q10 it just kind of looks
like this it's just a big bottle clear
oil and just also really nice to remove
makeup because they really break down
the makeup quick clean you kind of use
on your eyes and face and it does the
job well so looking forward to trying
that it's got grapeseed oil in it which
is nice also from Gino McCray I bought
the brush bath which is a brush cleanser
and I just thought this was cool because
I've nearly finished my Mac brush
cleanser and I was gonna just kind of
buy another one by like trying new ones
and I'm not really one to like scrub at
my brushes with shampoo I love the
thought of it I wish I was I just don't
have time and I always forget so I
prefer to have kind of a thing that I
can just put on a napkin or something
and saw my brushes inning and kind of
spot cleaning them and it's in like a
little spray which I quite like so yeah
looking forward to trying that I'll let
you know how it works and then the last
thing is from Beauty buffets brand owned
brand and it says nail polish and it's
just kind of a fluorescent yellow and I
saw it it thought I want to try that but
the day I got home I tried it on my
hands and I don't it's because my hands
are quite tanned but it just looked
horrific and way too bright and just a
dirt just looked weird make a curl it I
had to pick for my nails then I'm it's
fashion week and everyone was wearing
so I probably should have kept it on but
oh just not huge fine I'm gonna keep it
try again when I've lost the tire on my
hands but yes a little bit too out there
for me so the last two things for this
haul are things I bought in the airport
the end of the holiday we had a couple
of hours in Bangkok Airport and I had
kind of a thousand baht or something
left and I didn't want to have to change
it when I came home so the first thing I
wasn't planning on buying but I really
needed a new one and it's the NARS
Laguna
I finished mine before I went away and I
was going to just use my jewel a
hydrating bronze until it finished but
actually I've already hit pan on it
quite a lot so it would only be finished
just in and you guys have seen this I'm
sure a million times but it's just a
nice bronzy colors my favorite bronzer
ever and I'm going to keep this until I
finished measure weight I'm gonna be
good and then get onto this one and I
started get it in the airport because
it's kind of no tax it's get cheaper and
then I also was a little bit naughty and
treated myself to a Chanel lipstick but
I realized I actually don't own a Chanel
lipstick so if someone who really likes
lipsticks that's a bit crazy and so I
bought one of the Rouge Coco shines and
this is number 62 Monte Carlo and it's
what I'm wearing today and I wanted like
a pretty pink lipstick but I can't
really wear like baby Pink's and I've
been wearing a lot of dark lipsticks
recently so this is like a pretty pink
but it's kind of like a darker pink I
did I just saw it and thought that's
perfect it's got a little bit of orange
in it as well actually I really like it
and wearing it today
and I love it so yeah happy I bought
that and that's everything I bought in
Thailand so yeah let me know if you want
me to do the Thailand kind of how I
traveled video and I'm going to try and
pop a kind of montage of where we went
if I can find some music so thank you
for watching
oh also I am going to Paris tomorrow I
hope in grades Paris for two days with a
few other bloggers I'm so excited so I'm
gonna vlog my time there and hopefully
that I'll be up on Sunday so yeah really
looking forward for that very busy at
the moment very tired but having a
really nice time so yeah I'll see you
