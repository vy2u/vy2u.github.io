desk is such a mess that I really can't
like concentrate the stuff everywhere
I need tied to my necess I'm playing
down from time in a moment but I will do
that later
alright editing time so we're coming
towards the end of every day May and you
guys have been sound kind with your
comments that let's tweet saying like
I'm sad May is nearly over lots of
people asked me to do daily vlogging
again daily vlogging is quite hard and I
don't know over the next few months if
I'm going to be able to do it again but
I do still want to keep flogging and I
think feel like if there's ever a time
to change up my video routine it's now
because I'm all out of sync anyway with
daily vlogs so please let me know what
you guys would like at the moment well
when I'm not days logging I do a vlog on
a Tuesday beauty video on a Thursday and
a beach video on a Sunday or like beauty
fashion those kind of things if you guys
would like me to instead do two vlogs
and one beauty video a week so a vlog go
to stay afloat on a Thursday and a
beauty video on a Sunday let me know if
you want me to change the days maybe
mondays are better to upload or
Wednesdays or Sundays I don't know let
me know what you think because I'm
really open to changing things all the
time I want to do what you guys like I
enjoy vlogging I like the feedback I
like that I can just be me and vlogs
I still like making videos on a Sunday
yeah I don't know let me know what you
think maybe there's another way I can do
it let me know which videos you like and
what days you like me to upload and all
that jazz and I'm having to think now
about reaching things a bit you guys see
the spider is hanging from the ceiling
in the middle of the room I nearly
walked into it that is so evil crap I've
just realized it's monthly favorites
time I completely forgot I thought this
Sunday's video was gonna be my night
before morning after 1:00 but it's the
end of the month so I needs to my
favourites and I haven't even decided
what they're gonna be so just go
upstairs to my bedroom and I'm gonna
like have a look around and try and
remind myself of my monthly favourites
it's kind of what I do and I make a list
in my notebook as I do it I've got 10
items which is none
like the amount that I have so I'm gonna
leave it there and have a think see if
anything else pops up and I'll probably
film that tomorrow because I haven't got
any other plans tomorrow I'm so creative
aim faster and ketchup right now but I'm
gonna be good and try resist um I think
there is actually some food so yeah it's
not speared I'm gonna have tuna oh my
gosh loads of cheese there tuna sweet
corn mayonnaise in something hey tuna
first I didn't record any of that but
you didn't miss much I just put tuna and
sweet combo I'm just squeezing in some
mayonnaise it's not up do you know equal
mayonnaise just reminds me of being a
kid so yummy
this is gonna be good I'm clearly not
one of those people that makes like
amazing healthy salads for lunch I just
get too hungry too quickly and then I
don't I'm done sure you know sweet corn
sandwich okay I'm gonna head into the
game office for a meeting I'm wearing
double denim today Ryan a denim shirt
and jeans and I just don't know if this
is allowed but I'm doing it anyway
I'm very casual today I bother to get
dressed up but I'm sure they won't mind
I'm gonna head in and have a meeting
check my peer box and then come back
home and I'm gonna walk to the station
I'm gonna try and be good because it's
such a waste of money to park in the car
park in the tube station car park and
it's really not that far of a walk so
I'm not going to be lazy it's a sunny
day and we're gonna walk to the station
okay I'm in town now and I was listening
to the choice of an air biscuit and
podcast which is a particularly sweet
one he's a very sweet guy
and so I'm just gonna go and have my
meeting now all right I'm leaving now
after my meetings and I'm going to brush
out which I'm not used to this nice
towards the tube station with people but
this this and you pick up some popcorn
on the way though because I'm so hungry
yeah I'm gonna head home
I'm in charge of dinner tonight and I
fancied something kind of Mediterranean
II but I'm not really very good at
cooking so I'm gonna make it up as I go
along and the idea in my head
this definitely worked better the beef
but I don't feel confident enough in
cooking beef so I'm just care of the
chicken couscous here's a very piscis
with like like chopped tomatoes like
chalk like tomatoes chickpeas courgette
and like onion and chicken so it'll be
kind of like a Stewie type thing but I
don't really know if it'll taste very
good but I'm just gonna make up I'm
looking for rich at my dad and neither
of them are very fussy when it comes to
they'll just think this is great so I
feel like I can experiment a bit and
I'll see if they like it so I'm gonna
start with a I'm gonna you know go make
smart a sauce maybe okay apparently the
best thing to do is too far off the
chicken so that's kind of brown take out
and then cook the sauce in here and put
the chicken back in when it's ready so
that is what I'm gonna do okay the
chickens kind of cooked and we start on
the sauce which is helping me care up
because I haven't quite mastered cooking
at whilst not messing the whole kitchen
up yeah it's kind of a mess of here oh
my mom always says clean up as you go I
just can't multitask like oh I need to
do the cooking knowledge everything will
burn but I'm just gonna like brown off
the onions and do some garlic and then
put courgettes and the tomato sauce and
the chickpeas in and make it with sauce
see me off add the chicken and then cook
the couscous which have been
particularly noisy right now I'll cue
and aegis-1 up everyone's loving it
really yep okay so this is what the
sauce is looking like I put the onions
and first and garlic and then a bit of
tomatoes with the cause
chicopee's by got the chickpeas that are
like precooked you just keep it up and I
mean let that simmer I'm gonna put in a
bit of salt pepper as well I think this
is looking good
proud of my invention making up as I go
along I saw such quite a bit to go
because the courgettes I don't need to
be cooked or have the chicken because I
want to see it's not kind of fully
cooked they could deal with a bit
cooking in the sauce for the yumminess I
think this is gonna be good I'm excited
for this alright looking good but I
think tastes a little bit too much like
pasta sauce so I want to make it a bit
more Moroccan Imam said sumac is a nice
kind of flavor to add to it so I might
add a bit of this I'm just gonna smell
it first so it's a real meal see oh yeah
that is nice had a bit about my brother
and Lord has sent me a photo video that
he found on his phone that they need
obviously filmed without him knowing
babies my five year old nephew and he's
vlogging and he's obviously just because
he watches all my vlogs he's literally
doing like my vlogging voice is the
funniest thing ever
oh I see what it's like so funny that's
literally the best thing ever
amazing he's literally he's gonna be the
next the next vlogger the next big
vlogger this is the finished dish and I
think it's nice my arm just said next
time I should call the cook all the
things certainly because it gives better
flavour excited to eat I know what you
think rich did you like the dinner
good weather my mom started eating it I
said maybe I should buy some cookbooks
that's not promising but look where are
fish sitting for my friends jammer and
Ben now any like people who are against
fish in balls though angry at means it's
not my fish all our fish are in the pond
in the garden but we are gonna look
after their fish for them for a little
bit and it's kind of fun having a little
pet look it's called Meg it's a girl
she's not very active at the moment I
think she's okay
the parent she's just sleeping
a bit worrying but yeah she was swimming
around before we have to feed her bit of
this fish food everyday and be nice to
have a little pet so that's make now you
guys know Meg I'm gonna go wash my hair
now because and he's film tomorrow and
it's a bit greasy
okay this shower in our bathroom is
broken at the mall
okay this shower in our bathroom just
making fun of me because it's that funny
the shower in our bathroom is broken
it's leaking downstairs and like making
them all wet so I'm gonna go and wash my
hair over the bath tonight and I'm just
gonna grab my stuff from in here bumble
and mom will Sunday shampoo look new
finish that which I like to mix half
that and half living proof shampoo
because it the Sunday one is a little
bit harsh by itself and then I'm going
to take the living proof conditioner as
well this is what the shower has done to
our wall whoopsie I'm really bad at
washing my hair over the boss I feel
like I'd never wash out a conditioner
and then this I then I go through all
the house of straighten my hair and
never feels quite clean enough so I'm
going to try really hard to wash it all
that I hold my hair tonight and not do
my back in as well how old-school at the
tiles in our bath three we had this
these tiles for about 35 years and look
over here

sister there's like one there there's

their toothbrushes in here and that's
how old this bathroom is

wet brush to get all my knots mi
illustrate to my hair tonight or
tomorrow night it's pain it's quite late

highlight of today was probably getting
some that video of Bailey vlogging it's
