and I hope you're having a really nice
weekend so far first of all I just
wanted to say thank you so much for all
your comments on my Q&amp;amp;A video I was
really happy with how it came out and
it's it like a whole day to film so
thank you for all your lovely comments I
thought I'd do a midweek Sunday video
and I wanted to create my own tag I
don't think I've done this before I
might have done it once but hopefully
there isn't a tag like this already I'm
not hundred percent sure I'm calling it
the beauty scenario tag and I'm gonna
tag from my favorite youtubers at the
end so keep watching to see if I tagged
you there's eight questions so I'm
getting it started scenario one you have
to get rid of oil foundations but you're
only allowed to keep one high end one
and one drugstore which ones do you keep
this is actually quite an easy choice
for me the high end one I would keep is
the YSL youth liberator Foundation which
I'm wearing today and I wear most days
when I film because it's so glowy and
you just look lit from within and I just
think such a beautiful finish and the
drugstore one I would keep is actually
Revlon nearly naked and I haven't spoken
about this all in a while so it might
surprise you guys but I think I'd keep
this on because it works really well for
summer and winter you can build up to
kind of a medium coverage in the winter
but it can also be quite share in the
summer so a pop of the fact it doesn't
have a pump I really love this
foundation scenario too you go for an
interview and the lady interviewing you
has lipstick on her teeth do you
approach the subject or ignore it
completely okay so I think it completely
depends on the interview and who's
interviewing you if it's quite formal
interview and the lady doesn't seem like
she has any kind of sense of humor then
just ignore it
you just don't mention it but I think if
you're interviewing somewhere that maybe
like beauty related and she seems quite
friendly and chilled out then you can
kind of make a joke about it and tell
her and I think that way maybe she'd
just remember you better than anyone
else and you might end up getting the
job scenario three you're not quite
feeling yourself and you need a
pick-me-up which lipstick do you wear to
make yourself feel beautiful when I'm
feeling a bit rough I think a red
lipstick always makes me feel a little
bit more kind of pretty and beautiful
and one of my absolute favourite red
lipsticks is from Tom Ford they're just
pure luxury nice lipstick
the sauce put cherry lush and it's just
like a true red slightly darker I think
than your average red it's just
beautiful and it's by Tom Ford and just
applying it makes you feel expensive and
beautiful so that's the one I would
reach for scenario for you go back in
time to your early teens how would you
wear your hair and makeup differently I
would just embrace the curliness of my
hair
I either tied my hair up really tights
to kind of get it away from my face and
feel like it didn't even exist or I
would put so much mousse and gel on it
so it would look and feel wet because
when my hair was dry I felt like it was
frizzy but it wasn't really frizzy it
was just curly it was a little bit
frizzy but it made me curly so I think I
would just embrace the curliness
and try and find some products that work
and make up why they didn't wear much
makeup when I was teenager but when I
did there was no balance I Eve all like
a blue eyeliner and nothing else on my
face and it can seal or anything or like
I don't know Foundation and nothing else
I never kind of got the balance right so
I try and balance out a bit more and
chill out with the green eyeliner
scenario 5 you ask your hairdresser for
a shoulder length Pixie Lott style
haircut but they miss hear you and give
you a pixie cut instead do you a smile
say thanks
leave throne your mom hysterical be
crying the chair and things get really
awkward or see complain to the manager
and demand a refund I've had similar
situations not quite as bad when I was
younger which is why I'm petrified of
hairdressers and I used to just kind of
say thank you and leave and then phone
my mom crying hysterical and she'd
always say go back and tell them they
could fix it but I was too embarrassed
so when I was younger I probably would
have done that but I think now I'd kind
of say something I wouldn't kind of
complain and get all angry but I'd say
like this isn't why I asked for and just
let them know so they're aware of their
mistake so I'd say see this time
scenario six your friend surprises you
with a four day trip to New York which
do it all pallette do you pack in your
makeup bag I put this question in case
one of my friends sees this video and
decides to surprise me of the trip to
New York although I'm very much doubt
that's going to happen
but if it did I would grab my Urban
Decay Naked palette I know it's been a
bit boring choice but this is just my
favorite eyeshadow palette it has
everything because it's got like the
daytime shades and then you can also
build up to be more smoky in the
evenings and I normally take this away
with me and sometimes I take like a a
quad from my map by shadows because
there's a few shades that doesn't have
but this pretty much has everything you
need in one scenario seven your house
has been warped don't worry everyone's
safe
but what's the first thing when your
makeup stash that you think oh I really
hope they didn't take that so I'm sure
your beauty stash is the last thing you
are thinking of if your house is robbed
but just for the fun of this video I
think the things that I would miss the
most of my stash are the bits that are
harder to get the stuff that I had to go
to America to find because they're kind
of hard to replace so that would be my
Tarte Amazonian clay blushes which are
just beautiful I have three they're so
good and you can only get them in
America well you can't get them in the
UK and another thing I got in America
that I really like my Josie Maran
coconut watercolor cheek she lays I have
these and two colors and they're nice in
the summer they're like a gel kind of
cream blusher and these were also really
hard to find so those are the things for
nothing everything else I could just go
and buy a really mister scenario ate
your friend borrows a makeup item and
returns it in awful condition do you a
just pretend you haven't noticed be say
something and ask her to repurchase it
or C do the same thing to hers I think
for this one I'd have to say a and just
ignore it because I don't want to be
that person that's really weird and
protective over their makeup but
hopefully none of my friends would do
this to me and I think they'd probably
notice if they did so that's everything
from my Beauty scenario tag I really
hope you enjoyed it just a little bit of
fun kind of midweek video I'm going to
