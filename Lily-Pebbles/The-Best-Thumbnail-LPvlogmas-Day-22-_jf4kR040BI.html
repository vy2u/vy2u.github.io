i have greasy hair today because I'm
heading to Suffolk for a few days and
then going straight to my parents for
Christmas Day I want my hair to last so
I'm waiting to the very last minute to
wash it I know that's gross but I'm
probably either gonna wash it tonight
tomorrow morning before we had the
Suffolk so today it's gonna be a greasy
hair in a bun day I hope you guys can
accept that I'm already in my current
scarf because we're gonna head to my
parents house and then have lunch with
them I'm gonna help my mom decorate the
house for Christmas I think the plan is
to head for chicken soup and salt beef
sandwiches for lunch me my mom both feel
like we need some chicken soup in us so
I think that's probably what we're going
to do I've already had my dairy milk ads
and calendar I haven't opened my gem
alone one yet so let's do that now ooh
there you go 22 it's a perfume English
pear and freesia that's a really nice
summer perfume or spring and will that a
couple years ago I was wearing Mac plum
full lipstick this morning I'm gonna
reapply it I haven't worn this shade in
so long and I love it like really pretty
plum rich stop showing up naked in the
back of my vlogs so it just popped up on
my diary that technically today is the
day that I'm allowed to change my
earrings cuz it's been the right amount
of time but this side is still a little
bit affected like the top two earrings I
wake up every morning they're a bit
crusty
and they fill it with salt so it's
probably not a good idea to change them
yet and we're just gonna keep cleaning
them but these ones all doing okay so
maybe after the new year I'll change my
earrings I really enjoy this Macy Gray
winter wonderland cover any other words
you know rich is gone out to buy a few
last-minute Christmas presents and I'm
at my parents I'm just gonna sit and
watch a nice Christmas TV and relax I'm
very happy about it we haven't got sky
movies at home my parents do so while
I'm here I'm going to utilize it so I'm
just downloading elf I haven't watched
it yet this year June is really into
giving kisses let's do is get to kiss
your face rich is here now he's done all
this Christmas shopping you do work rich
yeah haha I mean baby oh here now this
is honey should we do honey's voice yeah
send your honey too busy what you know
yes but you wanna say no what do you
this is what watching this is right out
of time what do you mean Oh better make
your man like you you mean you're
overprotective when I'm leaving this
room is all cleared ready for my parents
I have a Neha's party tonight Minds
you've been a kid and running around in
tights Heidi's gonna do us a show I used
to beat this person you did shows you
gonna come watch the show Gino Gino is
gonna watch you doing teddy bears picnic
okay so we've get rigs ice about doing a
show then we will sit down and then they
get too shy I used to do that too
dunno get rich get richer you that pause
we've left my parents and we had some
fun with the kids
we're actually gonna go to hoppy crafts
now to see if we can get some stuff to
put my calendar on the wall
Visia time for dinner so we had just
like going crazy for the Christmas
canapes again we've gone for the sticky
Asian style chicken lollipops and the
mini chicken Kiev's and then let's just
get some like salad to go with it
yeah but greenery but birds or something
we're gonna pop into Hobby craft and see
if we can find something to mount those
pieces of paper on then I wonder if I
could just use blue tack cuz I don't
want anything too permanent I think blue
tack but I'll find something to stick to
paper on yeah my favorite place ever the
family's like foam board but it's too
big and they've got a full ones but only
in black they'd have any white left and
I'm not sure if I'm gonna be able to cut
that in half
besides because this would be perfect
but it's black and I think it will just
create a shadow of the wall and I'll be
unhappy with it
you get a couple of these and cut it
with a Stanley knife hopefully so anyone
else have the problem when you get in a
car no matter how long the journey or
what time of day
I have always fall asleep and I'm the
passenger always sleepy let me know if
you're the same I can't tell you what
I'm wrapping in case one of the kids are
watching my videos because I know they
watch but wrapping something round is
really hard I so should have got a box
put in this is proving difficult it's
gonna be a messy one what you put on
Hollyoaks Harley yokes
Hollyoaks and then put Love Actually and
have Christmas canapes yeah
not saying I'm a genius or anything but
wrapping it like a giant sweet it's a
pretty genius idea I'd say rich is gonna
open some more champagne it feels like
Christmas or something
you know rich is to work in a champagne
bar at uni what was it called in
Birmingham but Epernay if anyone knows
that rich used to work there
distilled champagne from when we got
engaged Cheers
that's why it's such good champagne I'm
gonna measure out the a4 with the piece
of paper mark with the pencil and then
cut it using this craft knife let's see
if it actually works
this is proving to be a bit difficult
and very time-consuming but I've done
two they're never gonna be perfectly
straight around the edges but I think
they'll be fine I've done ten I've got
two more to do but the food is ready so
all you've got mini chicken Kiev mini
chicken Asian e things with some fried
veg I mean roasted veg okay done them
all as I said they're not perfect but I
think it will look cool on the wall we
nearly killed each other but we haven't
yet and I think we've got line one up on
the wall and that's looking pretty cool
I just hope they don't fall down because
I'm not reprinting them and sticking
them ever again I think it's done and I
think I like it it looks pretty cool it
can always be removed if I change my
mind but I think it's pretty cool
January February March April May June
taken I've got it all right July August
September October November December let
me back up so you can see it in the room
mm-hmm
I'm really putting off washing my hair
and till I can be bothered I think we're
gonna watch Love Actually and I haven't
watched it yet this year so I'm so
excited we made sure we found it on the
sky and recorded it I think I wasn't
tonight at 9:00 so we're gonna start
watching it Richards making tea and I'm
just munching on some mint M&amp;amp;Ms and it
reminded me to show you guys because the
lovely Frances Quinn I don't know if you
guys watch the Great British Bake Off
you'll remember she was the winner of
last year I think and she watches my
Nana's videos which is so kind and we
met her at the stylus live event and she
very very kindly for my birthday slash
Christmas slash because she's lovely
sent me some mint M&amp;amp;Ms and other treats
she wants to debate me something but the
logistics were very complicated so
hopefully in the new year we're gonna be
but she also sent me her book oh it
literally just hit myself in the face
look how cool this is we're gonna take
off the cover thing because I really
like the cover of this book I absolutely
love this it's a like hide a book I'd
want it to look as cool as this white so
giggly writing a wooden spoon drawings I
really like it so I'm gonna definitely
try out some of her baking recipes
quintessential baking Frances Quinn very
cool so thank you Frances
really looking forward to looking
through this it's so pretty inside we're
both thoroughly enjoying oh it's got
like clever like measurements in it too
and like pie charts and I mean which are
both really enjoying Love Actually such
a good British film I really love it
which is the tea ready yet mmm your
favorite part of Love Actually so many
in the shop yes there yeah that's much
longer bit and then Carol singing on the
street when you took him for Nathalie
and the security guard they know and
that's funny and or the qaol the guy
when he says with the board's creative
that's annoying that that this is Rich's
favorite but the airport scene is the
actual best way the boy tells Johanna he
loves her the soundtrack to Love
Actually is brilliant 2003 was a great
year for music we finished watching this
it was lovely I'm gonna go to bed
and so I'm a hair in the morning rich do
you ever thought of the day I did a
thought of the day yesterday by the way
for you do you have one
tomorrow is the last day of vlogging one
more day of vlogging that is mad I can't
believe I did so I did 22 days because I
missed one day to it yeah and I'm only
doing 23 in total 22 days of consecutive
filming and editing and only one day did
it go up later than 6:30 it went at 7:30
so I'm going to give myself a pat on the
back I think I did pretty well I only
had one mental breakdown throughout the
whole 23 days and I still have the what
legendary illness my highlight of the
day was singing karaoke with Bailey it
was really quite funny and I definitely
know what Christmas day is gonna be like
now who knew you could just type into
YouTube like whatever song you want
karaoke and then the karaoke comes up
which has been so loud in the background
you're ruining my penultimate blog
alright see you guys tomorrow for the
last day of locus sad times also really
happy times know that you speak all
right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
