to short it to like Oxton area Kingsman
rose hi everyone so it's Saturday and
I'm starting my vlog a little later this
week because this week's been a bit
crazy I've had a lot of work to do and I
had the most amazing photo shoot with
Rankin on Tuesday but I wrote all about
that in my where life eats posts on
Saturday so you may already know about
that today it's actually Valentine's Day
but me and rich don't really yeah we
don't really acknowledge Valentine's Day
well I do I do
yeah you got me a card which is sweet
but I told him not to get me anything
because I just think it's been a weird
day I'm a bit of a Scrooge it comes to
Valentine's Day I always have been but
were you gonna go see Anna and Mark
today because we haven't really seen ymz
mark for ages and I haven't really seen
Anna in a non worst situation for ages
we are actual real friends so it's quite
a nice number to do things that aren't
working I forgot to mention that I'm
wearing one of my new Sephora lip creams
I'm not sure I'm keen about the colour
it's quite like bubblegum pink
it looks more nude in the bottle in the
like packaging thing so I think I'm
gonna put something on top I feel a bit
weird okay so we're at Broadway Market
and I'm gonna go find Anna and Mark and
I'm really hungry
it was very trendy around here I call me
removing him before I feel like I failed
as a London herb I'm very excited to the
poetry spell timid ones they sound right
up your street
and I went for bacon and maple syrup
brownies
your happiness on her face panic
starts raining in this news with our
food which is chemical but I've got a
pulled pork bun and it's absolutely
amazing people keep and burn all the
work let's try some juice from the
raving juice bar
real what the green juices show me
healthy and some okay the Marxist okay
grapefruit mint thing and delicious beef
so one
I've stolen marks days just much tastier
right we're now going into the Museum of
interiors and home or something like
that it should be nice to go all in to
kind of poke Merritt interiors so I've
never been before it's just by hawks and
overground
we've just finished at the Museum and we
had a really nice event with tea and has
gone I say Scott Moscow aside I'm just
gonna stick that's gone now I feel
confident about I never know what to say
so we got to our cars park do you will
kind of go side a quiet like a few then
well I remarks that the best we get home
then and eat your leftovers and we were
like yeah we should probably get home

I'm really excited I really want to do
some shopping and just have more at fun
and a remark time and so yay

Westfield well we're just about to go in
I've got a cause back sure so I'm gonna
head there and have a look tell me well
I took something back they couldn't give
me I don't know it was all exchanger
those things so that's why you want to
yeah
so I bought a bright yellow
anorak I definitely don't need it don't
you know why we're back on our marks now
and if you had a really nice dinner and
like I said I bought yellow anorak from
Topshop and photo stroke atop and an
anxious and we're just coming back and
we're gonna have some yummy desserts
cuz I brought some jaffa cakes which are
pretty happy about and we're just gonna
chill and have a cup of tea and that's
about all for today I think I'm gonna
carry on vlogging tomorrow I'm not sure
what I'm doing the day
I've seen some friends for dinner in the
evening so that's it at night
just thought I'd check in who is the
plane sequence which is this random game
I've never heard of that Anna's family
plays and listening to old school Craig
David Asher and it's great what are you
adding to the morning everyone
well my hair is in massive need of a
wash I just used dry shampoo and it
feels really gross today I am going to
see my cousins who are here for America
no have you ever get to see them so it
should be really nice to catch up and
then tonight I'm seeing some friends I
think we're going for a walk today in
lunch
think rich might be in the outdoor gym
in Primrose Hill so I'm gonna go sneak
up on him and see if I can find them or
they're walking into a gym full of like
scary men working out it's quite
intimidating but the second outdoor gym
so let's go see if he's there
whoops there's lots of luck using there
with Rob doing situps I left them to do
their thing
just going to Selfridges now my cousin
Molly just so much Chicago so didn't get
to see her that often and we're just
gonna just look at Detroit not Chicago I
thought that was in Chicago oh my god
terrible and they're gonna get home love
meet around Selfridges
the whole restaurant on the top floor of
Selfridges who knew looks really nice
recommend go in there I'm going to come
back for tea one thing
Oh home now I feel like I haven't been
having all weekend so I'm just gonna
collapse on the sofa and watch TV before
I go out tonight it was really nice to
catch up with my cousins they were from
Detroit not Chicago no I said that and
you go from Detroit and last year but I
promise I'll show you what I got though
I really wanted to get the Charlotte
Tilbury glastonbury lipstick and
matching lip line now once I've got
something like that in my head I have to
get it so I got the mattes
revolution lipstick let me show it to
you my Tamra del Sol this gorgeous berry
shade I kind of had it on my hand from
earlier and I got the matching lip cheat
lip liner she does lip liners in colors
now as well as just the nude yesterday I
bought this yellow anorak from Topshop
but I got it in a tense that's all they
had I thought the ten would be it was a
bit small so I bought the twelve today
from Selfridges it's like a bright
yellow anorak and it's got this nice
lining and there's what I really like
from Urban Outfitters but it's like I
think it's like over 100 pounds and this
one was fifty which is really expensive
I've got nothing to keep it yeah I
decided but I really like it and I just
think readers for spring everyday like
the bright yellow and I got my friend a
good luck card cause he starts his new
job tomorrow
I'm just gonna chill out and watch some
TV or max on YouTube yeah but can use
Smart TV so I can watch YouTube on TV
now it's just fun so I'm going to do
that and I'll catch up with you guys
later tonight so we're on our way out
for dinner now I had a nice
I don't know it's kind of relaxing
afternoon watch a bit of TV and I went
and changed that top top coat as well
and got a Topshop top and running stop
shopping we're now going for dinner so
we're going to the restaurant I think
it's called area no.2 or something I
keep thinking of ariana grande but it's
a couple of our friends been there and
really liked it and you guys all
recommended it in the comments so when I
saw that I was like oh we should
definitely go there because everyone's
recommending it so I'm really looking
forward to again like last time I
haven't done any research so I have no
idea what the food's gonna be like I
feel like it's gonna be similar to
Ethiopian but I don't know why I just
feel like it's gonna be quite maybe like
bready and dipped I really don't know
what to expect I'm really excited to try
something new so we're nearly there now
we're like five minutes away case we
finished our meal and it was really good
I'm Sachi quite surprised because I
thought it was really similar to Turkish
which is a cuisine we have quite a lot
there was like kebabs and chicken and
lamb and rice and hummus and like
brights to dip and when I wasn't
expecting it to be like that I don't
know what I was expecting it tastes it a
bit more between like Turkish and I had
like quite a curry flavor to it as well
I really liked it I definitely eat that
like all the time and that was really
yummy poke you can see me right now I
don't know if you can next month is
Mongolian food so if you have any
recommendations for a place that we can
eat in London I think a few people last
month said that they have some so
hopefully you guys can leave me some
good recommendations in the comments
below
looking forward to that one that's gonna
be next month so just heading home now
and I think I'm going to continue
vlogging tomorrow night's because I've
got a little special gathering at my
house where I will explain all about
that tomorrow so for now good night
hi everyone it's Monday night and
haven't seen you since yesterday but I'm
having quite a fun evening tonight with
my friends basically it's quiet explain
Backstreet Boys have like a film
documentary thing coming out at the end
of fo all the details for the film below
but I was given like a secret preview
link so I'm gonna watch a majority vlog
so I'm gonna watch it tonight with my
brains we're all massive battery fans it
was like proper our generation I've got
a heart Nick Carter written like all
over my old bedroom so we're gonna get
together

like a good hostess show you what I've
made quinoa salad guacamole and Chris
and I've got veg with people don't want
crisps and I've got almond milk for
people who don't drink normal milk and
I've tried Gemma so I think it's gonna

sjakie shudders Hannah and Gemma are
coming over so gonna be a good night
it's already anyone saying no want to be
on camera
Hey go for it I have chocolate for these
two mm-hmm welcome only you can make
rich isn't allowed that girls nights are
going to Benz by just thinking a bag of

whole vlog is gonna be a 90 throwback we
were just saying what our favorite
crisps were from school can you tell me
what your favorite Christmas gone oh my
gosh where's Gemma when they get
dispersed that's right you're the most
enthusiastic eyed everyone here when I
say cover their face but you can move up
make more space we can also bring that
sofa in look who's ready to go we had
some great pop songs oh yeah

Backstreet Boys songs that will everyone
stop talking makes a bit angry I just
took a bit I nearly ruined it for you
but I took it out all my friends have
gone home now and it was such a nice
evening I didn't really love a bunch of
it because it just didn't feel like
appropriate but we all kind of had
dinner together and made food and then
we watched the film and it was just such
a throwback we were such a hardcore
Backstreet Boy fans like you don't even
realize you know all the words and we
like no weird facts about all the
members of the band and so it was really
fun singing along and I think the films
coming out at the end of Feb 24th maybe
it means cinemas and there's like a
special performance at the end so
exciting it's a really good film it's
like a good documentary film that three
years leading up to the reunion tour in
