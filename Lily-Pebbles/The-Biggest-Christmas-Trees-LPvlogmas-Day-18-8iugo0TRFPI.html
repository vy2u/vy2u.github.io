we're now walking into the center of
Vienna to go and meet Jake for breakfast
will checks out of our hotel it's not
raining
it feels really fresh and nice firm
attendance and for you too you did you
sleep well yes way to the gym as well
morning
do you remember no I didn't even hear
you leave
only you go to the gym when you're on
holiday I mean lots of crap
so my thoughts on Vienna so far I've
obviously only been a hook for like a
day I think it's really nice I feel
really comfortable you know when you go
somewhere new and you feel like you
don't really know it and you feel a bit
lost I don't have that feeling at all
here I feel like I've been here before
it's very comfortable
people seem nice just very pretty clean
and I get I want to come back properly
properly properly or properly properly
something else I've noticed was Jake
kind of pointed out when we got here so
people would literally don't cross the
road until it's a green man like in
London and we just kind of walk we're
really bad like that that people are
very strict you know you walk with green
and also in some places just one green
man it's like two little green people
holding hands
sweet where are we now
stressin van
no that's good bus oh I love all the
buildings in Vienna they just look
there's a mighty bit of London like old
and beautiful brewing it's good lands
dress and we're gonna find Jake he's
like yeah I'm just here is like a huge
station where are you Jake where're you
taking us yours it's yours it's I think
we're now I'm gonna head to a Christmas
market because we didn't really get to
appreciate yesterday in the rain and
we're gonna walk through a nice park on
the way I think we're here looks pretty
big I want a hot drink I've heard
there's something my hood look at my
hair I've heard this I think who's like
kinder kinder bunch sounds like it's
gonna be non-alcoholic and warm and
yummy so much Highlands first juice
I got a hot chocolate Jake got a hot
chocolate
oh the snows and rich got hot apple
cider
honey honey cider good
enjoy your honey
cider my hot chocolate but it nice like
I always get full halfway through my hot
chocolate the first half is yummy making
some you'd stir quite aware that in
these vlogs I'm like now I'm here now
I'm here but there's not supported in
between just in case you're worried I'm
not getting to see Vienna to do it lots
of walking in between the bits that
we're seeing and now we're not wanting
to be like this shopping bit now because
I'm kind of fed up of wearing my penguin
hat now and I wanted to play that they
were like know how options for women but
I came down to the men's found a nice
gray hats I'm gonna buy that rich trying
on a comb that's a much better lately
I think this coat really suits you I got
my new hat which says his new coat on
mmm daddy's you did get lovely nothing
another we saw this yesterday like all
these amazing huge Christmas trees that
they're selling in the middle look how
big and amazing they're much better than
our Christmas trees they're so big great
Jay can you stand next to it for size no
Jake's a normal sized person look five
so they're like seven eight foot whoa
look at this one another Christmas
market now probably the do vine and this
one is particularly good so I think I'm
gonna get some now I feel ready I can't
go together and not have some new vine
so before I go I'm gonna have a nice
glass this one's really pretty and
there's like all these particular diems
around
he called take let's say Jake's best
German right let's go stand and then do
like your Cheers

not too sweet sweet yes not too sweet
the charities rich the pheasant plucker
sug gotta try one more time who is
sitting here no I'm not I'm not a bit of
 son many peasants in the
president of Helm's wait son I see a
plucking business till the pheasant
pluckers done huh
I'm not a pheasant plucker on the
pheasant plucker son sitting here
waiting we love we have to leave about
five which is better than all the time
and parenting is not much to do at the
airport in Vienna so we're gonna get
like an early dinner we had brunch so
now we're gonna have like linner
or done whatever you like to roulette I
like done I like dance and Jackson take
us to like a quite wheezily reasonably
priced sushi and ramen place good neck
oh okay
yeah it's good it's like it's it's
decent and it's quite cheap what is so
that's why we're heading now we're going
to look at Douglas does everyone always
tweets me about this place is like a
high-end Vita stores
different techniques Sanna this is our
going for sushi and ramen
I'm the Jake's recommendation of cheap
and cheerful Jake got duck crispy duck
ritual it's amazing like sweet teriyaki
beef and then we got sushi salmon
sashimi and the spicy tuna roll it's
really delicious with this broth white
cheese Tyndale I cheese and literally my
favorite thing ever is to get these
about Jenny's restaurant slurs here we
go
yeah is it a little celebratory dance
can I make a crack my fault you know
okay let's see what my fortune is all
the answers you need are right there in
front of you which is my team meeting
Jake's right eat something couldn't be
cheap but I think it's definitely
richest though of the day it's what's
with the numbers we keep seeing those
numbers in this nation until Vienna we
don't know what is JC translates it
we're still not sure what the numbers
mean
look these are all the numbers pi oh
it's pi pi equals o I don't really get
it though why I mean let's cool I'm not
really sure oh my god this is pi
funky stations in Vienna hi Jake hi
well everybody did have a proper vibe is
this is a blog by
creak yes yeah the Christmas markets are
so pretty at night there's all like lit
up and spot-clean we're just walking
back to his house get our bags see we've
come back to the hotel to get our bags
and our we're ready to head to the
airport on the train we're in the
airport and our flight is delayed by an
hour but then sometimes it says by 15
minutes that we're not sure but the
problem is the airport's opposite here
to what we used to do so normally you go
through security and there's little
shops there this one we didn't realize
you go through security and there are no
shops so we've now got an hour here with
like no food or drink or any pictures
between us so I'm just sitting here
charging my phone waiting for
we've landed back in London and lovely
the plain tissue without the soil on it
in a cup makes it she said it would
really help my ears she gave some half
an hour for landing
I don't know if it's just because I
better definitely help at all the paint
was on the way out this is like no more
ears popping so thank God for that
lovely and it's not easy
Thank You Reena get me up first and then
get a to blow the club
we should win which is like why you
being so not being huggy like I feel
like I'm just seeing you for the first
time you've spent two days together
right yeah don't remember I'd like now
I'm finally better and like I've just
woken up
around the galaxy
we never even devices and even never
liked it and I just get
expressed we've tubed and then we've
walked to a finally home but we're
getting back in the car cause you're
gonna go to our local I know we are sad
I had a craving this has gone past
midnight you just like dumped our bags
and the like a flat and I'm gonna get my
downloads but it was an interesting
journey home that's for sure we
completely forgot them not only is it a
Friday night but it's like the last
Friday that everyone's working it's the
last Friday before everyone breaks up
for Christmas and it's Christmas jumper
day and it's like all Christmas party
day so we had like one lady to the left
of us who was in her like Christmas so
if you can't see me Christmas party hats
and she was a sitting there with her
Christmas like the one you get a
Christmas cracker eatin her McDonald's
so happy about life and then the guy to
the right of us had like a full-on like
red suit with snowmen all over in like
matching tiles so funny everyone was so
drunk when we got to be Toria it was
really quite amusing
so I'm gonna sign off now because we're
gonna injure McDonald's and then have
showers because I feel gross off that
cheap journey and head to bed highlight
of my day oh my god I can't even
remember I've done today cuz it's been a
long day but I think probably when we
were standing the Christmas market
having blue vine that was a really nice
moment thank you guys for watching I
hope you've enjoyed my Vienna vlogs I
feel so much better so I feel like I'm
gonna be much more me from now on
