say as you guys know if you saw my last
video thank you so so much for 200,000
subscribers I have actually mentioned it
in a video yet so I just wanted to say a
big big thank you what wait before I
continue with this video I forgot to
mention the me and Anna are having a
London meetup at the end of the month so
check the description box below there's
a blog post with all the details you
need to know I just wanted to let you
know for today's video I'm going to be
doing the British tag which was made by
Sami from the booty crush and I love it
I think it's so much fun I am very proud
of being British so I definitely wanted
to do it I've got other questions here
on my phone so I'm just going to get
started question 1 how many cups of tea
do you have a day and how many sugars so
I probably have her on two a day if I
could I would have about 4 but I'm so
lazy when it comes to making tea I think
I'd have one in the afternoon and then I
always have one in the evening after
dinner before bed it's like a con go to
bed without tea I have my tea here
because that is one of the rules at this
tag you have to drink tea while you're
filming it I have English breakfast tea
I grew up on L grade because that's all
my family drink and I just thought that
was normal tea until I would do uni and
then tried like PG Tips and I was like
this is so much better so now I drink
that and I like to make the tea really
strong so really straight up tea bag
that leave it in there for a few minutes
and then put a lot of milk in I have
skimmed milk I don't know why we've
always had skimmed milk in my house it's
not like a health thing I just prefer it
and I find semi-skimmed taste too creamy
for me so I have it like this I don't if
you can see it's quite weak but I'd have
any sugars in it I never have no one in
my family takes sugar in their tea so
it's just kind of a habit so yeah this
is the perfect cup of tea well actually
it's not because I made it rich makes
the perfect tea he makes tea for me
every night he's so good but he's just
the best tea maker ever pushed into
favorite part of your roast it would
have to be the Yorkshire puddings for me
I love those especially where they're
covered in gravy
me and my sisters always have like two
or three each when everyone else has one
I'm just obsessed with Yorkshire
puddings I prefer the smaller ones
though I don't like them and they're
huge number 3 favourite dunking biscuit
now this is a really a biscuit all of
you Americans are going to say but
that's a cookie but this is just the
ones you've always had in my house
growing up and I absolutely love them
any of my friends will know exactly what
these are going to be
they're the Maryland chocolate-chip
cookie they look like this I'm gonna
have to open up I have like two or three
of these every night really bad they
just work so well in tea right so I dunk
it leave it in for about this long if
you leave it too long it falls in the
tea and that's a disaster mmm no sure
god it's like 9:00 in the morning by the
way and I'm eating a cookie gobble
question four favorite quintessentially
British pastime I didn't know what this
men I don't mean not pastime is but I
think mine is picnics and playing
rounders I love having picnics and I
love picnic food and just chilling with
my friends and family and I love playing
rounders I think rounders quite like an
English school sport I was always the
bowler
and I was really good at batting if I
say so myself you basically it's a bit
like a baseball or softball but slightly
different rules I think if I could girls
sport as well I don't know any guys that
played it at school but yeah absolutely
love rounders and I still play it now
with my friends I have cookie in my
teeth number five favorite word and I
guess this is like any English word I
couldn't really think of anything but
then last minute I thought of hullabaloo
which I really liked
so if I was to use that sentence it
would be what's all that hullabaloo over
there
so I think that means like like
commotion up for I think it's a funny
word and it isn't a dictionary I looked
it up number six favourite cockney
rhyming slang I have a few bees and
honey money Adam and Eve what was that
one Forgan Oh would you Adam and Eve it
believe dog and bone which is phone I
think cockney rhyming slang is hilarious
number seven favorite sweets when I used
to go to the corner shop to get penny
sweets I always loved the little
mushrooms are they're so tasty they were
always my favourite those and like Astro
strips which like red licorice with
loads of sugar on them eight
what would your pub be called I don't
know um let me know if you can think of
anything good maybe like the pebble in
the Prince the Prince in the pebble I
don't know something like that
pubs always the or there's something
head um so maybe the prince in the
pebble although I don't know what the
prince is about
be rich I don't know number nine number
one British person
so first person I thought of was Beckham
but then Paul McCartney he is definitely
my number one British person if you live
under a rock and you don't know Paul
McCartney is from the Beatles and I love
him
I once bumped into him like literally
bumped into him I was believing my job
when I work within Gap Kids and I walked
down the street and I bumped into
someone made eye contact and then he
walked into the wine shop and it was
Paul McCartney I literally ran around
the corner phoned my mom hysterical and
my biggest regret in life is not
speaking to him because he is one of my
dream dinner party guests um I love him
so yeah he's my number one British
person number ten favorite shop or
restaurant
I guess shop would have to be Topshop
it's like so British I remember and
Topshop started it like changed fashion
on the high street and I remember at
first they just sold like vest tops like
plain colored vest tops and jeans and I
used to buy all my t-shirts and vest
tops from there it's changed so much
since it started it's just so like
trendy I find it so crazy when I see
young girls like looking so trendy
because it's so easy now to just go and
buy an outfit it was so much harder when
I was a teenager yeah I really love
Topshop restaurant
I don't really know that's too hard I
love restaurants too much go on my blog
I recommend like a different restaurant
every week I can't think of one I love
like going to pubs for Sunday roast but
any I mentioned to you just to like
locally specific to me so just like my
favorite pub 11:00 what British song
pops into your head
okay to pop into my head three lines on
a shirt Jules remains to leave name
anyone who watched the World Cup that
year will remember that song was it like
96 or something love that song know all
the words also if you want to be my
lover you gotta get with my friends
Spice Girls
so English loved them I know all the
words the Spice Girls songs I'd wanna be
was their first single and I love it 11
Marmite yes I like Marmite but only
quite specifically I like it on toast
with butter the butter has to be applied
where the toast is hot so it melts and
then a tiny bit of Marmite and I don't
even like butter but
like it with Marmite so yeah I do like
Marmite no most people hate it I think
you get it for my mom so that's the
British tag shorts and sweets but I
thought it was really fun and I liked
the questions I think they're really
good so I'm going to tag some people
below who haven't done this tag yet so
