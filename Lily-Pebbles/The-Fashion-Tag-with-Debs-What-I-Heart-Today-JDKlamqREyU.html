friend depth we've known each other
forever
we've known each other since we were
three we met that nursery and I wanted
to do a video with Deb's and I thought
the best one to do I looked around and I
found the fashion tag cuz Deb's is my
most fashionable friend Evan's sees like
the most stylish person always helps me
with my fashion queries so I thought
this would be the perfect video to do
and it's basically just those questions
about fashion okay let's just read the
questions out so the first question is
how do you describe your style
you go first I think I just kind of
thrown together anything I think looks a
bit cool anything like I don't try to be
too over-the-top so I try and keep
everything quite simple and I'm not very
girly so if I'm wearing something like a
dress but always try and make it a bit
more grungy with a pair of like batter
to converse or poke boots or something
like that so I guess kind of grungy yep
I think you yeah rocky rocky quirky
quirky my next favorite women drivers
though I think mine would be I think
finally after 25 years I figured out my
body shape so I wear tight bottoms pair
of boots loose top tight arms because my
arms are kind of smaller than my middle
so I wear tight arms loose top quality
scarf these days I think I don't know if
there's like a name for my style would
you make casual cool casual cool like if
that's not name I'm taking it that's
mine I think that's the thing oh damn it
okay what are your wardrobe staples
okay so first wardrobe staple always is
a pair of skinny jeans I don't know if I
can
apply them to show you some Jews guineas
are the best and these are Topshop
please and they're super super stretchy
and super super skinny so I love these
and always a big like loose t-shirt this
is from Urban Outfitters which you told
me was too expensive but I wear it all
the time
look nice pair of Converse always and
like a good pair of kind of chunky boots
I ever the whole list okay I only
thought one of things I like I bought
the dresses up well because I really
like that there's really I've got really
nice Instagram / - you are a nice I'm
gonna insert it here I find it so the
dress yeah and then it's like and so
this is the Watersafe not necessarily
this print but a dress like this because
I wear it in the summer I wear in the
winter spring like literally anytime you
just put bare legs and a pair of sandals
if I want to be casual if I want to
dress it up and this lipstick I was
wearing it on Saturday I only put some
big like heels on this is why I bought
home to my channel she's so handy with
her fashion tips I thought of one
wardrobe staple but I guess because it
really is like a staple for me and you
already said it
Topshop Lee jeans are like my I wear
skinny jeans everyday I've got black
denim these ones which I bought to show
you guys and my green coffee once so
they're the Topshop leaves and they're
so skinny and I actually didn't used to
love these because I thought they were
too thin and they're not like normal
jeans they come here in it but once you
get used to it
yeah but they're so tight and I find it
really hard to find skinny skinny jeans
so I love these most expensive item in
your closet I couldn't think of any
clothes because I don't really as much
as I've wanted like a designer bag
forever I haven't bought one and kind of
I buy my coats at the from Zara and say
mine are starvin Ferrara's turquoise it
is offensive about my coat was I got
Wonder
40 balanced but so if that poly or my
expensive clothes though I have a couple
of things here what for accessory-wise I
have a Chanel purse actually got this as
a graduation present this is my little
Chanel purse that's probably my most
expensive accessory although I think it
might be the same price as my mucus
though the like that we need designer
things I really have and they're
specially given us forever
exactly and the other thing of these
ridiculous shoes I basically bought
these for my sister's we're doing rasa
bridesmaid Lily's not good with shoes I
am NOT good with Cheers I practice
parties these are so expensive and I was
with my mom and we were like wow they're
so cool look at them they're amazing I
was gonna be like the best boys made
ever and then realized once I started
walking around and that I can't wear
them I look like a tree I look too tall
they're too clumpy for my little skinny
ankles and AllSaints don't do refunds or
I didn't think they did exchanges at the
time or something no so yeah worse
purchase ever
okay so my most listened lever and which
it just means it looks really really
worn and I used to work for him so I did
get it at a very good price I'm not
gonna say how much but it's definitely
my best expensive item it's they're so
worth and you air all the time the way
all the time and every time I wear it it
gets I get complimented on it so and you
wear as like her fur Geno's yeah as I
put a furry thing over the top and you
can wear it under codes as well you wear
it more like a cardigan like I just
because I don't own any cardigans and
it's really warm but it's good in the
summer every little dress perfect
favorite designer mine is kind you know
because without cocoa wouldn't have the
little black dress women will you be
wearing trousers like in the evening she
was kind of you know she started a lot
of Trenton's and she was I like her as a
person and I think she was quite bolshy
and she was maybe a bit of a feminist
like that and obviously you know she
never
is never gonna go out of style and it's
very chic and I think it's kind of apart
from the price tag it's kind of easy for
everyone to wear I think that's a good
answer
I'm not even gonna try and top that
because I don't really know I'm not
really like int of designers been to
Fashion Week a few times and I love all
the shows but I can't say I have like a
favorite designer so there's no point I
can making one up and I actually agree
with everything you just said so why did
- how much do you spend on clothes now I
just decided I'm going to Kunal this
question because one I have no idea
- I don't want to have any idea like I
don't even wanna know I don't think I
spend as much I definitely spent as much
on clothes as I do on beauty products
but when I spend on clothes I kind of go
a bit crazy I I don't have an exact
figure but let's just say I'm gonna be
25 and I can't move out what are your
favorite places to shop definitely when
I can afford it Urban Outfitters um I
just think they bring in really good
like other brands so I really like it
for that and and everything I bought
from that even if for example that dress
is from there and it was I think 55
pounds which at the time seemed like a
lot for a dress but then the amount of
times I've worn it and then I've got a
pair of shoes here as well and the shirt
actually that's all from there and I
think that's probably my favorite shop
and then you know Topshop for kind of
staples and basics yeah Zara's money i
buy everything from sorry I mean not
jeans
I've always been from Topshop I always
buy legions because I didn't know they
fit me but pretty much everything else I
- Zara loves or I think the quality is
really good and yeah
yes when we fits me well well I say the
only thing right Harvey Zara is that
sometimes I'm like an extra small and
I'm an extra large and I think they're
sizing isn't quite I just ignore
everything everywhere I actually just
that's why I have to always try stuff on
because some shops I'll be like a 14
hour tops quite oversized and then
sometimes I'll be like the 10 like it's
always so it does vary I like never I
think
like almost a shirt sir oversized say so
he's home tonight all my days like one
size too small yeah yeah because they
would stretch yeah yeah nice or is my
favorite I love urban outfits as well by
never actually buying thing in urban
outfits is because I find it quite hard
like part with my money yeah right
Spence as you can say although they do a
good sale I got my jumper in the cell
favorite fragrance this is easy for you
because I know nice to say Rodriguez for
her and this is what it is no difference
in the black one and the pink one yeah
this is the toilet and I think one is
the parfum which it's a bit I find it a
bit too strong which is weird because I
go this is a hundred little bottle and
this doesn't last mean they don't always
kill me yeah this is a really popular I
know you don't like to know that but I
know a lot of people don't wear those I
always smell people wearing it a bit it
reminds me so much of everyone says that
Paolo a new one this one like oh yes I
stole it from my sister's room once with
it but my friend Ricci effect I don't
know if you've seen an anchorman sure
everyone has but she calls it sex
panther you know the perfume because it
comes up in a big black poster and I
take it one year to Glastonbury and she
was like what are you doing I just love
it again because I'm not girly and it's
quite like a musky my skin but mine is
eccentric molecules molecule one's
pretty hard to pick a favorite fragrance
cuz I love lots but above my tip teak
ones I mean this is my favorite like the
pheromones yep
it's really nice I love it what's your
favorite way to do your hair
okay wait another reason why it's good
to have doubts in this video she has
amazing and in case you haven't noticed
you know like the longest have anyone I
know I'm gonna have to put like a little
clipping of her full hair links but it's
amazing I can't remember the question
how do you do boys my favorite way to do
hair oh yeah this this is littering it
always found always down but dads used
to have a fringe like a proper blunt
fringe and she's growing out yes it's
still like sometimes I feel a bit and
like Axl rice you know from Guns N'Roses
like a bit like 80s rocker from the back
but sometimes she was up but then you
get a like I can't wear it in a ponytail
it's so heavy it's so so happy he's so
jealous and but yeah it's normally if in
doubt down and natural color
I'm just feel like I'm like selling you
how do I start my hair like this I know
it doesn't even look growing my sister
every day my sister's I put it back put
it back and loads of people always
comment saying she change your hairstyle
but I very difficult hair so this is how
I do it just tracing it using my ghd's
and I normally clip half of it up that's
just how I like it
what is your go-to outfit we were just
laughing about how we really hate that
saying what's your go-to outfit when you
have no idea what to wear
I'm gonna go first because I know
exactly - and I'm wearing it
mine is tight skinny jeans doesn't
matter what color a loose top with
tights arms legs therefore these ones
are from Topshop and I love them they're
so good and boots at the moment I'm
loving my Hudson boots which are these I
love self the leather ones so boots
skinnies loose top jacket done easier
yeah okay again going back to like the
80s rocker vibe leather all leather look
trousers this is when you don't know
what to wear always I feel like going
out okay
keep in mind is like my example was for
like an everyday okay I like it I I wear
these to work all the time and again you
can put these just like I'd wear it with
like a white t-shirt and a pair of
Converse and just easy but I thought it
was a going out thing so I put that
although actually if I was going out and
robach your tea as well maybe put some
lipstick on but leather trousers and
then and can't go wrong with the sheer
who are you dressed like that this is
from Urban Outfitters again notes and
their pins and needles no good a ratio
so you just wear like a bra underneath
yeah we did always I'm always a bit
awkward about through sure thing
and then I put a vest top and then you
kind of see advocates yeah
I know oh yeah yeah I ever said oh this
one's not oversized but normally like an
oversized she and Jeff used everything
and and then again this if it was for
going out these monstrosity also from
Urban Outfitters they are Deena and
Ozzie which is a really cool brand that
they do that actually my bags and
there's that and they are so comfy I
can't even tell you
also I'm only like just right before and
I hate being short so I always try and
wear like a big you know this you can
wear these monstrosity yeah and I look
like a true when I wear heels I look
some of you when I don't say but and
they were I think 90 throwing puns but
I've had them for like three or four
years and I learn and nearly every time
I go out and I got them yeah yeah good
one fashion change you wish could come
back or stay I'm thinking about this so
I didn't even think about the fun I'm
gonna go for Danbury yes when I used to
wear them when I was younger
obviously wore them with like a white
polo neck jumper tied around my waist
and trainers if it went well you know
that's in the nineties never maybe not
exactly like that but I've seen
sometimes I see like so many cool people
and Shoreditch rendering stronger B's
rain dungaree usually yeah and I like
you are so cool I wish I can go over
there you could do it if you did like
with the slap down like I don't know
like manganese grandpa
I don't know but I wish that they were
cool again in like a big way they're a
bit kind of neat at the moment yeah yeah
I didn't know about this questions and a
nice red velvet that I felt it flares
from eminence nice M&amp;amp;S oh I loved them
show us your most prized possession in
your wardrobe I think oh yeah I couldn't
think of what to do what to have I don't
think I have any kind of life couldn't
live without I love more I want
everything I don't think if I leave my
case I'd cry but the things I really
can't live without running and flying it
by that's me
even though they're not like that
special they're my Tom's wedges just
because I love them and I wear them all
the time and they're the company's shoes
I've ever bought and I love the bank so
if I lost them I just buy them again so
mine is a sentimental one cuz I can't
think what to bring because by my jacket
would be my priceless because this scarf
was my grandma's and and I just love it
it doesn't you know kind of stuff smells
that kind of it reminds me of her and
I'll say I think it's quite cool and
it's nice it's good coloring of me and I
think even though it is a bit like gin
see but yeah I just love it and it's
like a true vintage piece that's really
nice my most precious machine because if
I look it's you know it's got no money
so if I ever lost it back that's a nice
way to finish the video I think that's
all the questions is everything we've
had on a question is that on a beauty
question okay what's your favorite
lipstick that was really cool lipstick I
didn't put any other today but what's
your favorite cuz you every one's my
favorite the one night wearing most at
the moment on her copper nut I don't
know what it's called do boom Oh Mac Mac
Dubonnet definitely don't burn a and
think so I'd like that one but then my
like we're going to lipstick and again I
don't know what it's called though but
it's from dainty doll I think you might
be called Hello Sailor
you're by danger dolphin aren't you
thick dense no fun for any other Paley's
out there it's really good it's like a
break other than that with me but it's a
really really bright red it's really
like nourishing I think because it's not
normally I'm fine yeah I find red
lipstick goes quite dry and again every
time I wear it people always ask me that
it's problem see anyway that's it for
this video and let me know if we do more
videos with Deb's
I think that went really well you're a
natural yeah
be looking at the wrong place I still
look at that thing that always confusing
anyway thank you for watching and I'll
see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
