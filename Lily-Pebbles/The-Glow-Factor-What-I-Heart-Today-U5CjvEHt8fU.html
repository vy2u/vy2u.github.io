obvious I have cut all my hair off as I
said in my last video I was planning to
have a little cut and I basically went
from there there I have a blog post on
it on my blog so I'll link that below
but yeah I'm really happy with it my
hair just really needed a good chop it's
just being so unhealthy this such the
ends and the ends are just so much
thinner so it feels really nice to just
have like the same thickness of hair all
the way through and yeah it's on first
day wash so it looks a little bit kind
of fluffy but I am enjoying it so far
yeah I'm really happy with the cut
so I've been thinking recently and
realized that I think a lot of people
who watch my videos don't necessarily
read my blog and so I thought it might
be a good idea to turn some of my
favorite blog posts into videos so just
in case you missed the post you can
watch a video all about it
so the once a day will be the glow
factor which is a post-dated or wahala
go and it went down really well I've
added loads more products there to the
video so I'll link the blog post below
but if you have already read it
and watch this - because I've added some
new products into the mix so this is all
about the products I like to use to get
that sort of glowy fresh pretty look and
face products eyes lips cheeks all of
that and there's loads of products to
talk you through so I'm gonna get
started so the first products are two
sorts of primer liquid highlighters and
the first one is the Laura Mercier
radiance foundation primer and this is
one of the many sample kind of sizes you
get in the kits and I love Laura Mercier
primers I have the original one and I've
got like a tiny bit left in a pot I'm
just looking over there at my makeup
stash um I really like it this one's
really nice if you want that sort of
glowy look because it works as a primer
so it'll make your makeup last all day
and sit really nice get in the skin but
it also has a really nice glow to it and
it's not glittery or shimmery it's just
really kind of subtle and just makes you
look fresh and healthy and I just think
Laura Mercier prime-minister feel really
nice on the skin they're sort of
water-based rather than silicone so
don't feel greasy or anything it's for
really hydrating and I really really
love this well next one is another I
talk about a lot and it's the Clarins
instant light complexion
so in zerah zerah Rose shimmer and this
is one that I like to mix with my
foundation or tinted moisturizer you can
put it on first it's kind of like a
liquid highlighter I like to mix it in
and just makes the foundation feel
lighter look more glowy and just make
the skin really radiant
it's called Bros shimmer but it's not
pinky I currently wear pink colors it's
not really a tool it's kind of just like
a champagne color I just think this is
so nice and whenever I wear it I get
compliments on my skin I just think
glowy skin just makes your skin look
better when you look glowy and radiant
people always compliment you in things
that you have good skin even though it's
not necessarily good skin it's just
glowy skin so for foundations I have
three very glowy Juve ones and then two
sorts of less glowy but still luminous
the first one is the Y cell latane
t-shaped our foundation which I talked
about a lot and I absolutely love this I
wear the shade b40 this is kind of like
a gel foundation and I use my hands to
apply this I feel like that what's the
best way for me and I just really work
it into the skin and I've always got
compliments when I wear this foundation
saying that I've great skin and it just
is the perfect amount of juin s it's not
too jewy it still gives good coverage
and I haven't got a bad thing to say
about sound nation I love it so next one
is an old favorite in this origins plant
scription
SPF 15 foundation and I've nearly
finished this one I really need to use
it especially but I love this I wear as
area to light Mutual and this feels a
little bit like a tinted moisturizer but
I use a brush to apply this you can use
like a buffing brush and it's just a
really natural just looks like your skin
but better again and it's a bit chewy
but not too much this one's more like a
foundation and I just really really like
this and the shade is perfect for me so
I definitely recommend trying this
origins counters are really good at
giving out samples so you can go get
pots of this to try at home and then the
next one is a source of new foundation
but I've spoken about it before it's the
Revlon nearly naked I think it's cool
that all my writings rocked off nearly
naked and this is in the color 120
vanilla which is the lightest one I was
wearing nude before when I got back from
Thailand but now I'm vanilla this is a
really nice foundation it's quite
affordable as well I think it might be
eight nine
might be more I need to check that but
it's really kind of like tinted
moisturizers are very chewy but you can
use a brush to apply it it does feel
quite wet so you might need to put a
little bit of powder in places to kind
of set it but I really really like this
foundation and for a drugstore like High
Street foundation it's really good
I'm very impressed with Revlon and the
powder to go with its really good as
well the two not so glowy foundations
but still very luminous are these ones
the first one is the armani luminous
silk foundation i have a shade 4.5 and
this is a favorite of amelia for me i
love beauty and anna familiar does
makeup and I love both their makeup
choices so I really wanted to try this
and it is really nice this is more of
like a true foundation it's got a good
coverage I'm wearing it today I use a
brush to apply it and just buff it in
and it kind of blends in really nicely
and does feel very like silk like yeah
it's definitely more of a proper
foundation but as the name suggests it
is very luminous as well so you can wear
if you would like a kind of fuller
coverage foundation you can wear
something like this and still have a
luminous kind of glowy skin just a
different kind it's not really Julie
it's more just luminous I really like
this foundation the next one is a new
one I've been trying and it's the jerome
act moisture tint SPF 15 and I got this
from cult Beauty I wear the shade linen
which I think the second to light shade
so this is supposed to be a matte tinted
moisturizer which is just bizarre I
don't think there's like anything else
like gets injured moisturizes obviously
normally very dewy and flowy and this is
the matte version so I don't think this
is actually that matte I would never
normally wear a matte foundation that
just scares the hell out of me I've got
dry skin so just not good combination
it's not really matte it's just
basically not very jewy
but it still looks really natural it
just kind of blends in with your skin
and looks invisible and I use my hands
to apply this whenever I get a new
foundation or anything like that I
always use my hands first I think you
have to get to know the sort of texture
first and then you can decide whether a
brush work better or to carry on using
your hands but I really like using my
hands with this because it is so light
when I use a brush it sort of just
doesn't really do much so I use my hands
to kind of work this into the skin and
it's really light she
which is really pretty but it's not to
glowy
or jewy if you do have kind of oily skin
this would be a good one for you if you
want to what if you have oily skin and
you want to wear it since moisturizer
this is just perfect
so for the face I think it's really
important having juhi glowy skin it's
not just about your base or foundation
it's also about the other products you
use and I think blusher can be really
important for that as well so obviously
cream blushes are really good at giving
you that jewy kind of moisturized look
and I really like the Kevyn Aucoin the
creamy flow blusher and this is the
color tres Belle I've got this one space
NK and it's basically just cream blusher
I can't open it they go it looks like
that the color I got was actually could
either darker pink because that just
suits me but I think it would be really
pretty in a light pink as well and it
would kind of add to lots of
spring/summer glowy look these are so
nice they blend really easily use your
fingers or a little brush but I find
that finger is kind of easier the brush
just sort of pushes your foundation or
tinted moisturizer off it's easy just
dab it with your finger and sort of
blend it in or you can use a stippling
brush that would be a bit lighter as
well I really like these and I love
Kevyn Aucoin products and yeah this is a
really good cream blusher the next
blusher
is Mac stereo rose and whenever I wear
this in videos you guys always comment
on my blusher so it obviously works but
it's sort of a hybrid between a PI
lighter and a blush it's pink and peachy
and champagne E and it's so nice so when
I wear this I don't wear a highlighter
as well I just wear this as a blush a
highlight and I love it's just the
perfect color for me and because it has
this or reflecting particles it really
brings light to the face and it reflects
light and just looks lovely and glowy
for highlighters I have a few here the
first one is such a good budget buy and
this as the Topshop quad it's called the
cream highlighter quad in kickstart and
this has four colors in it it has a
bronze a pink so it's like a bronzer or
blush and then to highlight colors so
it's a darker champagne and then the
lightest champagne and I just love this
quad it's so useful I don't really use
the bronzer that much but the cream
blush is really nice the lightest color
I always use
in the middle of my eyes there and that
really kind of opens and brightens your
eyes I feel like using a cream
highlighter in the middle it's just the
best thing you can do if you want that
glowy look and the champagne color is
really nice on the top of your
cheekbones under your brow bow down your
nose and a little bit on your Cupid's
bow and this is just the most useful
whatever I think it's the lout you
should definitely go and get it if it is
because it's just one of the best
highlighting palette I thought how could
I not mention my Dior amber diamond
palette this is just such a beauty it
looks like this it basically just has
one two three four colors ranging from
sort of a light right to a champagne to
a bronzy to an amber and it's a powder
highlighter and it's lovely it just
needed a little bit on a brush it goes a
long way and it just instantly adds
highlights the top of your cheekbones
I'd only use this I wear cheekbones
because it's very pigmented so I
wouldn't go crazy with this but it's
perfect for a quick fix it's really good
for the evenings as well and then the
last highlighting product is also from
Topshop and it's called glow and this is
the kind of polish I think there's two
kind as warm as a lot darker and this is
the one they call it white on the
website I wouldn't he says white it's
like a very light shone panie sort of
color it's quite hard to get out because
it's in a pot but I just dab my finger
in it and put a little bit on my
cheekbones like on my nose or the
Cupid's bow if I want to but this is
really pigmented stuff and it really
shows up some highlighting products I
find a little bit subtle I love my
Chanel highlighter but it is quite
subtle I'm wearing it today you have to
put quite a bit on with this you just
need the tiniest dab on your finger and
it puts the knees like wow highlight on
your cheeks I love this
I think Topshop makeup so good so I'd
recommend getting this as well so eyes
and lips also is really important to get
that glowy dewy look and the first thing
I find always really helps is a good
highlighting eye base something like
that and this is the Mac Paint Pot in
best idea which is one of the first Mac
for us I ever bought and one of the best
of the gold floating lid is a cream
eyeshadow it can be like a primer you
can use eyeshadow on top or I like to
use it just on its own and it reminds me
of Steeler kitten but it's just much
smoother and easier
and this is I wore this in the blog post
and it just instantly makes you look
really fresh and awake and Coon products
are always good if you want
juhi glowy skin even on your eyes so I
really like this and you can seize your
finger easily quickly apply it another
one for your eyes is the new Rimmel
scandaleyes eyeshadow stick crayon such
a long means always and this is in the
shade zero zero two bulletproof beige
and again this is a sort of Beijing
champagne color it's just a huge crayon
and I like to use this on the inner
corner and sort of the first half of my
eyelid or you can use it all over as
well as similar color to bear study and
these are really affordable and I think
this color is very nice and really
reflects the light and makes your eyes
look bright and awake two more products
to go and they're both lip products
they're both kind of lip gloss lip balms
and I think that is the best product to
use when you want this glowy dewy look I
said that so many times in this video
sorry but because it makes your lips
look moisturized and plumped and you
know losing a matte lipstick just
wouldn't work or even a heavy lipstick I
just don't think works it's all about
lip balms and lip glosses and my
favorite lip gloss at the moment is the
Bobbi Brown pink Lily lip gloss which is
from their new collection and obviously
it's called pink Lily which makes me
love it even more but it's a really
pretty pink I've got back into lip gloss
in a big way recently I don't know why I
used to hate lip gloss I didn't even
hone that many but I suddenly had the
urge to like violet gloss and so I've
been going out by and we'll these lip
glosses but I really really like this
one it's just really pretty pink perfect
for spring/summer and then the final one
is you guys know it's my favorite the
Clarins instant like natural lip
Perfector which is the sort of lip balm
lip gloss hybrid and it comes like a
little foam applicator it's just easy to
throw in your handbag and use on the go
and it really makes your lips look
moisturize and pretty and I just love
everything about this and it's like the
final touch to that glowy look so that's
everything I hope it helped you is my
favorite look the glowy dewy look I wear
it all the time most of the time and if
you have dry or dehydrated skin it's
even better because it just makes you
look moisturized and fresh and I can't
wait for spring I'll be rocking this
look the whole way through so yeah thank
you for watching and please give this
video a thumbs up I'll see you in my
next
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
