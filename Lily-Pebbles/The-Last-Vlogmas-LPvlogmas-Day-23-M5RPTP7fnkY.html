the last day of Laguz we're going away
to suffolk to see richest family and
then stayed with my parents over
Christmas so I'm just packing and
wondering whether taking two onesies the
little bit extreme but I feel like I
want to have my onesie options over
Christmas this is important okay I'm
just gonna start packing up I've got
three days to pack for but it's like
Christmas Day and nice days so I think
the first thing I need to do is wash
some of my brushes I didn't wash them
last night stupidly so I'm just gonna
have to like spot wash them but that's
so dirty so I'm just gonna take a few I
shadow brushes and just spot clean them
imagine for everything on one makeup bag
but I've got a bit crazy with the
lipsticks I don't know what I'm gonna
want to wear I've got Charlotte to help
me red carpet red Charlotte Tilbury love
liberty Laura Mercier spiced Rose Mac
mare Tom Ford first time and then after
Max or lip liner Matt cherry lip liner
and Clinique what was this nude one
intense blush so that's the cleaning
keep liner with Tom Ford first time and
a bit of Tanya burr afternoon tea just
in the middle because Tom Ford was a
little bit too matte I think it's a
pretty nude right I need Karen packing
no packing but rich is making us some
lunch with whatever we've got left over
in the fridge for week they were out
fresh tomato sauce for spaghetti - am I
not even made a pesto roach good bit
olive oil in there looks yummy smells
good
pasta you just watch you fly away home
which is one of my favorite films but
I've never quite understood why is the
daughter Australian and the parents
aren't is it just because is it Claire
Danes and she look younger I know Anna
maybe she just wasn't good enough at
doing an American accent then or what
she meant sound Australian
no one knows let me know yeah I'm this
looks and smells delish yeah I have no
idea how I've managed to fill a whole
sake suitcase full of stuff it's pretty
much just onesies and tracks of buttons
and hoodies in there before we set off
I'm going to give the flats a quick
mover so that we don't come back to dust
bill okay we've got bags shoes and then
we're going to take pretty much all
these presents as well so the car is
gonna be fully loaded presents the
richest family presents for my family
but is basically all just for the kids
we're loading the car and rich has made
his first how much stuff are you
actually taking comment well there's got
this in the post it's white company's
sales catalog this is everything it's in
the cell and there's actually some
amazing stuff it's really the only sales
that I care about cuz I hate sales but
I'm definitely gonna fold down the pages
and then visit a white company still off
Christmas there's so much stuff in this
car we're ready to go ready to rumble
what about the Love Actually soundtrack

show I'll explain later like a Christmas
show in Norfolk but we're gonna be
meeting Jake in Norfolk he's back for
Christmas from Vienna
so we're basically gonna go at me up
with him tonight and his girlfriend
Kelly who's in the show which I will
explain later I'm looking forward sit

we not do like Christmas or some form of
it every six months because everyone's
really happy now look they're all like

food Christmas show and it's pretty
famous although I've never heard of it
they've got this huge Christmas show

getting us in the Christmas mood so
we're driving so that's an offer
Jake's there he's back from Vienna we're
going to meet up with them have early
dinner and then watch Kelly in her show
which is parents and sister going to
come as well and then we're heading back
to Suffolk tonight spending tomorrow
Christmas Eve with Rich's family and
then on Christmas morning driving back
to London to spend Christmas Day with my
family I've never like driven on
Christmas Day before so that will feel
weird but it will be nice once we kind
of get back and have lunch how long till
we get it all for 54 minutes away in
Norfolk now we're not at first but yeah
I'm really hungry I only had breakfast
but I mean looked hungry
we're in SWA firm shoutouts anyone who
lives in swore firm hello father

ahead to say Merry Christmas everywhere
Christmas everyone here the Cochran
sister this look oh my god it is amazing
the low elemental is completely mental
Sansa that she thrown up in non-violence
thrown up and looked into the land
allowed to film that I can't explain how
Christmasy is crazy sequin outfits
dancers are wearing like no clothes for
Kelly the Maven her solos have been so
good she did a bit right by where mr. t
in there I just was trying so hard not
to her off I feel like smiling so big
it's the most Christmassy thing ever
that man that just came up through and I
was filming I got very confused is Sir
John who's the owner and director of
this entire thing that was really funny
what's his name Kashima it's giving us a
tour of the stage set in the interval
it's ridiculous in here I don't even
ever allowed to film this I'm so sad I'm
not film during the show
these are the trains just missed train
collection oh my god train actually the
guy that you you just photo bombed my
video blog bombed
these are his dreams Oh My Goddess
swinging Santa's receiving
so heading back to our seats for the
seminar
well how many shows did you do that was
my 64 so after six four shows you just
had to finish as they by two one that's
pretty emotional but you did so sit up
and cheered motional and dubs flu and
snow it landed on this advice kelly wish
them a happy Christmas and Happy New
Year I was a director like Rudolph
seeing Jake on Boxing Day that was so
fun I'm actually gonna start editing my
vlog in the car now because we're gonna
drive back to Suffolk now I think it's
like an hour and a half so I'm gonna
start editing now Drive back to surfer
enjoy it I did actually very Christmassy
where monkeys as we get in the car he's
lost the keys as he got in the car that
whole show just brought back childhood
dreams of wanting to be on the stage and
then musical theatre I wish I was better
at singing and dancing because that
literally was my dream and it just looks
like so much fun
although so much hard work those dancers
bodies are insane and they are so strong
anyway I just edited the blog up until
now so I guess I should end it but this
is pretty sad like those rukmi's
who knows I'll be doing next year who
knows anyway I really hope you guys have
enjoyed it thank you so much for your
nice comments throughout flog most and
you guys have been tweeting me and
commenting at my Instagram saying that
you've really enjoyed getting to know me
more and especially getting to know rich
Moore and his hilarious personality
because here's a funny one whilst we
have the state and and he said my
highlight of the day my highlight of
today was obviously the Christmas show
and I mean what else do we have to share
I'm gonna try I feel like whenever I do
vlogmas and vlogs I feel so weird
sitting down and doing like proper
sit-down videos because I just feel like
it doesn't show my personality now you
guys know my personality it's weird to
sit there and just talk about lipsticks
so I'm going to try and incorporate much
more of my personality into my main
videos if I can and let me know what you
guys want to see on my channel on my
blog you know it's a New Year soon and
I'm always up for trying new things it's
like my sixth year of blogging and I'm
not the sort of person that just gets
stuck in a routine I like to change
things up so if you have any new ideas
of what you want to see on Lily pebbles
on my youtube channel and blog and stuff
so let me know shoot me over some
comments
come to the end it was the sole because
those place the other weddings the time
of my life and
now I'll see you doo doo boo boo boo doo
doo doo - I've been waiting for all
right bye guys this is the end like I
need to go now this is like really blown
by oh my god only Jake will find that
