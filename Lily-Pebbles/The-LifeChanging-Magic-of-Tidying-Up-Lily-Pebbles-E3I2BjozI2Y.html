good Thursday today is the most casual
video I've probably ever filmed I am in
scruffy clothes I'm sitting on the floor
in front of my bed I hardly have any
clothes left because I've packed
everything they're all in suitcases
behind this camera and I've packed away
all my makeup I've got like five bits of
makeup to wear for this whole week so
this is very unglamorous but I didn't
want to stop making videos just because
I'm in the process of moving so I
thought that you guys would prefer
something rather than nothing but this
is quite different to my normal videos I
don't have any makeup to talk about
because it's all packed away instead I
thought I would do a book review which
isn't something I've ever done before
and I have no experience or I have no
right to review a book I'm just a normal
person I'm not even a very big reader I
would say I read more maybe than a lot
of my friends but anyway I'm kind of
going off the point here I am going to
be maybe not reviewing but talking about
a book that I read recently it is the
life-changing magic of tidying by Mary
Marie Kondo Devers yes Marie Kondo what
Mary because that'd be a why Marie Kondo
before I start I haven't prepped for
this video at all I haven't like written
down a list of key points or anything so
I'm probably going to go off on one and
if I end up saying something that
offends you guys I'm really sorry I'm
just kind of going to be talking and I
don't mean to offend anyone or get kind
of too opinionated about things but I
thought you guys might want to know my
thoughts on this book because everyone's
kind of talking about it online and I do
have some quite strong opinions on parts
of it it's a book that teaches you how
to be a tidy person which is why I
picked it up ironically it has a coffee
stain on it because this book lived in
my room for about two months before I
read it I found it like this with the
mark on it it was kind of hidden under
pile of clothes and I told my mom and
she literally could start laughing at
how ironic that was I'm quite a messy
person I'm definitely organized but I'm
not tidy so I really wanted to read this
because I thought seeing as I'm moving
it's perfect timing I can kind of take
my new tidy attitude with me to the new
place and kind of start on a good start
start on a good foot whatever the saying
is so let me start by saying yes I think
this is a very good book and I would
recommend reading it you're going to
think that's weird because I'm
going to say so many things I hated
about it but overall I liked it and I
would recommend it because you finish
reading this book and I think no matter
who you are what your opinions are of
Marie Kondo I think you finish the book
feeling inspired and feeling like you
want to have a big key route so that
alone I think is worth buying the book
for because anything that inspires me to
have a clear out even if I don't end up
doing it the correct way like she says
then I still think it's good because it
will make me be a tidier person so I
would definitely recommend it for that
reason and it was a very easy read like
don't worry if you don't read books that
often it was very easy to read I read it
at night and yeah nothing complicated
about it
so what I did whilst I was reading this
book I kind of folded down the page
every time something kind of hit a chord
whether I thought oh that's a really
good point or oh my god this is
ridiculous which happens more often I
don't actually know much about Marie
Kondo it says she's a Japanese expert
declutter and professional cleaner
she'll help you organize your rooms and
she's developed this con Marie method
which is like her method for clearing up
she says the key to successful tidying
is tackling your home in the correct
order keeping only what you really love
and doing it all at once they're not
tidying up bit by bit which is what I
think we all do but doing it in one big
event so let me start going through what
I think of just the kind of few pages
that I folded down and I'm sorry if I
get any kind of facts wrong about it
when you read at once so if I misread it
for some reason and I do apologize so
she starts by saying here that you
should need to start before you start
tidying you to look at your lifestyle
think about what you want and why you
want to beat idea so I think that's
really important completely agree for
example I would love to be tidier for
rich because it's really unpleasant for
him to have to share a bedroom with
someone that leaves their clothes all
over the floor so that's something
that's important to me kind of making a
happier home space for rich so yeah
there's a really nice bits like that
where she talks about why you want to be
tidier and thinking things through one
of the things I really wasn't sure about
is her theory of how to choose does it
sparks joy she has this theory that you
shouldn't keep something any kind of
object unless it sparks joy so what she
means by that is you kind of pick it up
here's mine up
top and if it doesn't make you if it
doesn't give you a spark of joy and make
you instantly happy then you shouldn't
keep it I mean I hope I haven't read
that in the wrong way but I'm pretty
sure that's what she means and I feel
like that's not a very realistic point
there's quite a few things in this book
that aren't being a very realistic to
normal people yes I think that can apply
when you're clearing out your wardrobe
you know instantly when you put on a
piece of clothing whether it makes you
feel good or not but in terms of every
object in your house I mean let me see
this TV remote does not spark joy my
pencil does not spark joy but I need a
TV remote to turn on my TV I need a
pencil because what if I need to write
something there's some really boring
household essentials that don't give me
any joy but I need them so feel like
that's quite extreme but I feel like
with all her points if you take them and
like apply them to your own life then
they still work you just have to kind of
take parts from it
I think the spark joy thing works when
you're clearing out clothes and handbags
I think you know instantly when you put
something on whether you like it or not
but I don't think that applies to
everything okay what else have I folded
down there's a chapter that's called
what you don't need your family doesn't
either and she goes through a lot of
anecdotes in the books which I like
talks about clients that she's worked
with and she also talks about times
where her theory has failed and what she
learned from it which I like one of the
things she mentions is when you're
having your big kind of clear-out
event she said make sure not to have any
family members present and to not let
them look through any of the clothes for
example that you're throwing out and
make sure you just kind of get rid of
them and I think I mean I get her theory
for me I'm the family member that clears
out all my clothes and then my sisters
take pretty much all my hammie downs a
few of them are left for charity shops
but they pretty much take so many of
them and it is a bit annoying that I've
kind of had this cleansing clear out and
then I have to see my sister's walking
around in these clothes that I was I'm
gonna Noreen over whether to keep or not
but putting that aside maybe my sister's
couldn't afford to buy new clothes that
a month or maybe it was the best day
that they got to get all these like new
clothes and kind of fill their wardrobe
with new stuff I think part of getting
rid of clothes in my wardrobe some items
I love but I don't wear them often
enough and I think someone else
get joy out of wearing this so I think
not
offering your clothes friends and family
is really kind of a sad idea and I think
that my sisters get a lot of joy from
going through my kind of hand-me-downs
and I think her saying not to do that
just for your own reason is a bit
selfish she also doesn't mention
anywhere in the book as far as I'm aware
about giving things to charity shops she
talks a lot about throwing away and
doesn't kind of advise you taking your
clothes or whatever you're throwing away
to a charity shop so I was a bit sad
about that because I take so many bags
the charity shops when I do my key
routes she did a little piece on
loungewear and I tweeted about this
saying I can't believe this woman
doesn't believe in loungewear I think I
kind of misread it she does believe in
loungewear but she doesn't believe in
kind of downgrading your clothes to
loungewear so taking a t-shirt you don't
really like and making it a t-shirt you
wear when you're just like sloppy now I
don't see how that could kind of ruin my
life I think it's a nice way of
recycling your clothes if if it's still
comfy and you want to wear it as
loungewear I don't know if they were
like that's another kind of extreme
point that I don't really agree with she
also mentions how women should wear
feminine pajamas and you shouldn't wear
kind of big sloppy pajamas you should
kind of feel feminine and pretty when
you go to bed which I mean if you want
to you should yeah but I don't think you
should feel like you have to I love kind
of big comfy pajamas and I think that's
okay she has a chapter on how to fold
and I found this really interesting the
way she described folding clothes in
drawers so it's kind of sideways and you
can see everything instead of on top of
each other I already do that my mom
taught that to me a few years ago and
it's a life saver it's so good so I feel
like if I didn't already know that tip
that would have been a really good tip
to take away on how to fold your clothes
and jaws she also talks about a folding
socks wait where is this oh yeah how to
treat your socks and tights with respect
this is one of those kind of times where
I took away a really good tip but it
just came about in such a weird way the
tip I kind of took away from this
chapter was that it's much better to
fold your socks in half and put them
like that and it's true whenever I fold
the top of my socks down they look so
messy in the drawer and they're really
hard to store but the reason she says to
do it is because your socks have had
such a tired day they've
on your feet ordained in your shoes and
they've worked so hard to protect your
feet that you shouldn't strain their
neck and you should put them to bed
nicely I mean I I can't get my head
around that kind of theory the way she
talks about her socks and handbags like
they're humans and that they've worked
hard and I mean I'll get onto it but she
thanks her handbag for the hard work
it's done at the end of the day I mean
there were many times reading this book
where I threw it across the room I was
like I actually can't deal with this
because I just I'm really not that kind
of person that talks to my handbag so
that was weird but as I said I took away
a good tip and I will definitely be
folding my socks better instead of just
kind of shoving the top and like
throwing them in a drawer okay there's
another chapter here that I've put the
corner down it's called designate a
place for each thing oh gosh this is the
chapter with the handbag okay so I think
I was on the plane with Anna when I was
reading this and she was just laughing
at me because I told her that was
folding down a page every time something
I didn't like came up and she kept
seeing me fall down pages like so she
comes home from work I mean I wish I
could be like this I don't think I could
ever do that she comes home from work
walks into her house and she takes her
shoes off Lila makes herself a cup of
tea she puts her hand back on her bed
and she empties everything out of her
handbag she thanks her handbag for what
it's done for her that day and she
thanks her phone she thanks all the
things in her handbag and then she puts
everything in its place
she'll put her phone on the side her
personal side she puts her lipstick away
her jewelry away everything in its place
and then kind of stuffs her handbag and
puts the handbag away everyday like a
maybe I get that it's not good to have
your handbag line by the front door but
I use the same handbag a lot and a lot
of people don't have time in the morning
before rushing to work to refill the
whole handbag with everything they need
I feel like that's so extreme and I wish
I was a sort of person that came in to
their perfect home and emptied my
perfect handbag onto my bed but I feel
like that's really unrealistic but I
would love to know if people actually do
that please let me know if you do
because it's amazing but yeah I think
it's quite funny that she thanks
everything in her bag don't
underestimate the noise of written
information I don't really know why I
folded this down actually I think it was
from the previous chapter but I think
she was talking about
story when she went to someone's
wardrobe and a lot of clothes still had
the tags on it I agree you should
probably take I sometimes don't take the
tags off because I think what I want to
return it but I think that she mentions
that scene clothes with a tag on kind of
doesn't make that item of clothing feel
like it's a part of your wardrobe it
feels kind of separate and new and like
it shouldn't be touched and if you take
the tag off and just like mix it in with
your other clothes then you're more
likely to wear it and enjoy it in order
for your clothes to make the transition
from store products into personal
possessions you need to perform the
ritual of cutting the umbilical cord
that links them to the shop that's what
I mean like what she's saying makes
sense but the way she says it jeez if we
treated all things we use in our daily
life whether it is our computer our
handbag or our pens and pencils with the
same care that athletes give to their
equipment we could greatly increase the
number of dependable supporters in our
lives
the act of possessing is a very natural
part of our daily life not something
reserved for some special match or
contest so she's saying if we treat all
our objects like they are supporters
tools family members then they will
treat us well back once my clients have
learnt to treat their clothes with
respect they always tell me my clothes
last longer yes if you look after your
clothes they will last longer but I
don't think it's because they're saying
thank you for looking after them all
right I have one more page folded down I
think this is where she talks about an
item or object serving its purpose so
she talks a lot about memories and
photographs and memorabilia and I have
quite a lot of things like that in my
parents house I have a box with my old
school uniform top that one signed in
the last day of school and I have lots
of photo albums and kind of scrapbooks
and things like that and yeah I don't
think hoarding is a great idea but I
also think keeping memories is really
nice and she talks about she talks about
things serving their purpose so a
birthday card once you've read the card
it served its purpose and you can throw
it away I kind of agree with a card
maybe I like to keep them for a couple
of days then I do throw them away and
then some things I feel like they can
serve their purpose more than once so
you can look at something years later
and then you'll get that same nice
feeling you did the first time you
looked at it in the second time the
third time
so I think you just have to judge what's
important to you enough to keep I think
a t-shirt from the last day of school
with everyone's signing is really
important and maybe birthday cards from
your ninth birthday aren't then if you
got one from your grandparents and then
they passed away then that would be
really important so I think everyone
just has to decide what's important to
you
don't let her tell you she wouldn't keep
anything I think this lady's house must
be completely bare and that's another
thing I think a home is a home it's nice
to be cozy and not too clinical so
anyway I don't wanna give the whole book
away I probably have I should have said
that at the beginning that this is a
massive spoiler but it's not like a
story so I still feel like it's an
interesting read and if you want
something to inspire you to be more tidy
this will I definitely feel like I've
got really good at getting rid of things
I had a really good clear out before my
move you just had to take it with a
pinch of salt because she comes across a
little bit crazy at times so this is the
life-changing magic of tidying up by
Marie Kondo and let me know if you guys
liked this very casual inexperienced
book review normal videos will resume
soon I promise
but until then I will see you hopefully
on Sunday with a new video see you then
