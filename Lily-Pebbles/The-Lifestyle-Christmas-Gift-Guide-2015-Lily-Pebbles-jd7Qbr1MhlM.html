today I'm doing my first proper
Christmas video I'm going this in
November it feels ridiculous do you know
how hard it was to find the Christmas
tree that's early on in the year but I
wanted to get this up a bit early for
you guys because I know that some people
start their shopping quite early and I
don't want things that I'm mentioning to
be sold out so that is why this is up in
November also just the disclaimer that I
kind of say every year me and my family
don't do crazy Christmas presents we do
Secret Santa so you'll pick one name and
spend last year I was 30 this year I
think we're gonna spend 40 pounds on one
good present I think Christmas presents
can get a bit over-the-top and crazy but
everyone has their own opinions so I
still wanted to do some kind of
Christmas guide but I'm trying to make
this one a little bit different and I
feel like there's a lot of people on
YouTube who will already have all the
amazing Beauty kind of gifts out there
for you to look at so I don't want to
kind of be repeating the same stuff so
I've tried to look at things that I
already own and go out and buy some
stuff that I genuinely would like and I
thought that this is just aimed at
people like me so if you're like a
20-something girl or you're a boyfriend
or husband buying for a twenty-something
girl then hopefully this video will be
helpful to you and instead of splitting
up into two I thought I'd just do one
big epic video split up into two parts
so I've done under 40 pounds and under
20 pounds so let's start with the let's
start with the under 20 stuff and I'm
going to start with the most affordable
item this I thought would be really good
if you're doing a Secret Santa a lot of
people do them at work or with friends
and you only have like a 5 or 10 pound
budget and this is $4.99 it's from H&amp;amp;M
home and it's a really cute little bulb
that says in gold inside very everything
and happy forever after and I think this
is so cute I love the little bowls and
stuff H&amp;amp;M home do because you can use
them for whatever you want you can put
bracelets or rings any kind of jewelry
in there or you can use it to kind of
serve nuts if you're sort of personally
likes to have people round you can put
whatever you want in it stationery paper
clips so I think that is really really
cute and it's only $4.99 hmmm home is a
great place to look for Christmas
presents the next one is 10 pounds so
still good for a Secret Santa and this
is a little ornament to hang on the tree
and it's by Emma Hardy
a mini version of her merengue cleansing
balm and it comes with a cloth this is
one of my all-time favorite cleansers
this along with Ostia one of my two like
favorite ever
it's a balm cleanser so you know the
drill comes starts as a balm you rub it
in it turns to an oil it removes all
your makeup really well and this is a
really nice way to try the product and
if you know someone who's really into
skincare I think that has a really cute
gift for them it comes with a little pot
and a little cloth as well and I think
that it's really sweet and ten pounds I
think that's quite a good deal this next
product is $14.99 so going up a little
bit and again it's my hmm but this is
from H&amp;amp;M Beauty hm beauty's new and you
guys know I absolutely love it and they
do some really good gift sets this one
is called the great hair day gift set
and it's really cute comes this like
pink box and you take the lid off and it
comes with three products I love the
hair ain't a package of heritage looks
so high-end and expensive so in here is
get a grip dry hairspray so everyone
needs a hairspray that's really good
just to keep a little bit hold up
styling and then the in-between days dry
shampoo I haven't tried but I do love a
good dry shampoo and it's good to have
trouble size as well as you can put it
in your handbag and then the dual BB
cream so this is a leave-in hair
Perfector again I haven't tried any of
these but I would love to receive that I
think it's a really nice selection of
hair products to try the sorts of
products that everyone can use a
hairspray dry shampoo BB cream and it
just looks really pretty as well so for
1499 I think that is a really good I
mean if you saw person spends a lot and
presents and that big good stocking
filler okay the next one I have behind
me here and this is something I already
owned and it's a copper L letter from
olive bonus they obviously do all the
different letters rich bought this for
me for Christmas last year it came in my
stocking and I loved it if you are so
president intellect interesti things
making things like Kristy or whoever
you're buying for is into that I think
needs a really cute that personalized
because you can obviously buy whatever
letters you want and because they're
kind of like grid-like
and clear they're not too bulky if I
like some of the heavier letters are
just too bulky was this is really sweet
you can put it on like a little picture
frame ledge or just on the side in your
bedroom I think it's really pretty
but when that letter is ten pounds
if he cookbooks a great present and I
was kind of racking my brain if I could
pick one book to recommend what would it
be and I asked my mom because she
literally owns every cookbook ever and I
wanted I also like what's the best one
that kind of most people would really
like and she recommended and I agree the
Madeline shall get the globe book this
is really good because it's healthy but
it's still delicious it's not like
completely vegans it's not unrealistic
people that still eat meat and I think
it's really great it's like really
doable there's not some recipe books are
just too hard for people who aren't
amazing at cooking to follow and I think
this is really easy to follow really
nice selection of recipes and I just
think it looks really pretty I think
it's a really great present to receive
and I got this on Amazon it's the
hardback I got it on Amazon for 10
pounds which is such a good deal again a
great stocking fellow or just a great
present by itself I would love that as
my Christmas present so that's the one
and recipe book I would recommend for
this Christmas the final gift in the
under 20 pound category is a scarf and
this is 1995 so it's pretty much 20
pounds and I think a scarf is such a
nice present to receive at Christmas it
keeps you warm and snuggly this one is
like it's really really soft it's cool
it's like gray kind of odd techy print
on it and it gray scarfs are really
useful because they kind of go with
everything and I think it's really
snuggly it's not too big some scarves
are to be my top footlong can't be too
big sometimes so it's a really good size
long enough to wrap around by the way I
have not mentioned my Christmas jumper
I'll show you properly at the end this
is Christmas John but I got from next
little bit it she I'd say like a 7 out
of 10 on the Itchy scale but it's got a
really cute polar bear on it that I've
named Cole so I'll show you Cole at the
end of this video but just need you to
put that out there a scarf is a great
present this one 20 pounds I think a
really good deal snuggly warm good
present ok so now let's get to the under
40 pounds category and the first thing
is from Charlotte's Hillberry and this
is the kissing fallen from a lipstick
tree mini lipstick charms this is so
cute it's 29 pounds which is a lot of
money for something so little but it's
Charlotte Tilbury for one if you know
someone that loves Charlotte Tilbury
it's always one such a tricep
Charlotte's ovary this is a great
present inside you get three
many cute lips take this cute and they
can be little ornaments as well they can
hang from the tree let me open them up
oh my god they're so cute this one is so
Marilyn which is like a red this one is
an NP pink which is a really gorgeous
nude and then the last one is bitch
perfect which is just the best thing
which is also really nice nude a
slightly more peachy I really like that
shade so I think that's such a key
present
I can't wrap it back up again but really
really cute 39 pounds
sorry 29 pounds 29 pounds something a
bit more personalized that I thought you
could do is I found this little brush
holder in H&amp;amp;M Beauty it's so nice it
looks very expensive it's kind of like
faux black leather textured with a gold
sit I really like that and this was only
399 which is so cheap and so what you
could do is you could buy this and then
you can pick your own makeup brushes to
put in so you can make this as expensive
or cheap as you like obviously if you
went for like shark Tilbury brushes or
Mac brushes or Bobby Brown brushes you
can make expensive I would also really
recommend so either and if you were to
get one face brush and to eye washes for
example from zoeva and the case it can
all come to 35 pounds I don't have a
face brush from zoeva so I just put my
shirt tip we want in there instead but
for example you can have a face brush
and then two different eye brushes and
then you kind of picked brushes you
think are right for that person I think
that's quite a nice idea or coming out
okay so you can tailor that to your
budget but I think wow that's a really
nice idea the next thing is from Kate
Spade Kate Spade has a home section I
absolutely love I bought this myself
in America like a couple years ago but
I've seen in the shop in Covent Garden
that they do that here as well and they
do a couple of different ones and my one
is a little tray that says odds and ends
it's like a proper plate with the gold
trimming and there's beautiful like
handwritten font and there's all
different ones that you can get so I
recommend looking on the website are
going into the shop to have a look this
one in the UK is 34 pounds and it comes
beautifully wrapped in a gift box and I
think it's such a special gift to
receive and you could use this kind of
for your keys or for your hair clips or
for whatever you want to keep it on the
coffee table
it's so nice definitely someone that
likes homey things this next one is 27
pounds and it's from Oliver bonus that
and it's a really pretty necklace dan so
I had this like marble base and then a
copper stand so it's got a smaller
section here but you can hang like rings
and bracelets on and then you can hang
long necklaces as well this is where I
keep all my necklaces and bracelets and
rings and I love it and I think it looks
beautiful as well in the home so that's
27 pounds which I think it's a really
nice gift as well for the girl who loves
nails there's this sect from nails Inc
is 30 pounds and it's the Alice and
Olivia range I think this one it's a
great pick because it's a really special
packaging and it looks really kind of
high-end and fashion II and there's four
nail colors there's a really pretty
peachy nude a dark like wine color the
gold glitter and a more like metallic
red and they're really nice like festive
shades I think for the girl that loves
nail polish this is a really special
little kit and I would love to receive
this in my stocking or just as a present
I think it's really cute but hey I need
a couple more to go and this one I went
to pick up from Liberty last week
because I just kind of got it for myself
because I need more anyway it's the
eccentric molecule molecule one perfume
they always talk about this one is 38
pounds because it comes with a case I've
never bought this one for myself for
folks I normally just get the refill
which is like 27 pounds but the idea is
you buy this one first so you have the
case and then you just buy the refills
so for 38 pounds you can buy someone or
yourself or whoever this perfume it's
really cool it's like a pheromone thing
I think that's the word where you can't
really smell it on yourself but other
people find it really attractive and I
can smell it myself when I first put it
on and I love the scent it just it's so
hard to describe you have to kind of
smell it yourself but people always ask
me what perfume I'm wearing when I wear
this so the case is actually it's like
metal it's quite heavy and how does this
work oh yeah you take the lid off are
they you and it just slots in there so
you can just buy this by itself and it
just kind of goes in the case and looks
really chic so that's that's how you can
my travel with it anyway I love this
scent and it's really special if you get
it from Liberty you'll get the little
purple bag and they can kind of gift
wrap it and it's just really special
okay the final thing I always like to
recommend some kind of subscription I
think I recommended like a magazine
subscription last year which is still a
good idea
it's like the president that keeps
giving and a three-month subscription to
this company is 33 pounds plus like
postage and packaging I think and it's a
beauty box kind of it's the my little
box and I really like out of all the
beauty boxes I really like my little box
because it's more than just beauty it's
like a lifestyle box and this is a
really bad example this is the last
month's which it was their pinch s box
but normally it comes with this
beautiful illustration on the front this
was really cool because it's got like a
picture of a girl like putting up all
different prints on her wall and it's
really cool but normally they have an
illustration and it's just such a
beautiful box to receive I'll show you
what it's like inside so you open it up
like this and there's always like a
really pretty illustration and a bow and
then you open up and as a magazine and
all different things there's not really
like a lifestyle products or beauty
product just really interesting things
every month I'm surprised by how good
the stuff inside is so a three month
subscription I think is a really nice
gift and something a bit different the
gift that keeps on giving all of that
and then they can always extend it if
they want to so those are all the gifts
that I'm recommending this year for
Christmas it was something a bit
different for you guys I know that
everyone kind of takes Christmas
differently for me it's all about family
and the food but if you're into the
present thing as well then maybe you
found something interesting for my gift
guide there won't be a new vlog on
Tuesday instead there will be my monthly
makeup routine and a slightly exciting
announcement so don't forget to come
back 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday to see that
and I will see you guys then bye oh I
forgot to show you cold the polar bear
look how cute is he and also look at the
little snowman behind me he's very cute
too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
