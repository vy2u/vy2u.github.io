unfamiliar with us makeup brought a bit
of a video rolling daily today and we're
gonna do a tag video on my channel and
on her channel as well and we thought we
both want to just make up a new tag
because we were kind of looking for
wants to do can really find any that we
wanted to so we just made up for it yeah
and mine was gonna be the London tag but
she probably guessed from the title
already and I thought this is forgive a
good idea I've lived in London my whole
life so I'm quite a Londoner and
analyzing prone yeah yeah and Anna's
just moved to London yeah she's like for
London newbie so very new like two
months me so this bit mean if me to make
it easy it's fine you can just like pop
so yeah we've got 10 questions and we're
just gonna get started so the first one
is I took my laptop here because I look
down and is favorite place for breakfast
she was here first
yeah you go first in my face thing yeah
I know what you're going to say so I had
to so I'll do the other ones I know so
I'm gonna pick calendar which is a
bottom of Highgate in North London and
it's just a really nice cafe and it used
to be calendar and cafe mozart but now
it's just honda and they just do a most
amazing like full English breakfast or
like musically or anything and it's so
yummy and it's really nice like to go
after a walk as well you think I'm gonna
say Phil yeah which was kind of my idea
we love those because they're feels like
all over the country now so I love those
because quite like a bright anything
originally waiting saying I love that
yeah I love that french toast is the
best moment honor no not a French toast
yeah it like Bonanno and like steering I
have nothing
but I actually really love the breakfast
club as well I mean you know know their
pancakes are amazing yeah I think it's
telling me to always a kid if you go
that we have a key is like round the
corner don't think it's worth the key
but if you can just walk straight in
definitely do and there if you like
berries with vanilla cream on pancake
I'm not going after breakfast okay and
we also thought it's very tough for
those beats questions so the next one is
your favorite boots and Superdrug
it was my side of it weird I think
someone who's like us coming London it's
quite good to know where the good ones
are yeah I think my favourite
they're quite near actually the
Superdrug is Marbella oh yeah I was
familiar that's like a future of Marble
Arch by my own self
yeah and they got everything and it's
all brand-new shiny huge SP counter it's
already tidy exactly yeah and I think
the boots as well at Bond Street exactly
what was all Westfield once um I think
the favorite the one in westerns massive
and like downstairs I put all like the
makeup counter stuff and at the fact
they've got all like that it's a chef a
special shepherds were switched on my
hair and wine Bond Street is all I
really like yeah I couldn't really like
seafood rug Maharaja all the way back
who we think is a good food
yeah I think Mike's book I mean I'm
going to be using my favorite out the to
but I can't think like the best one
right here I'm going their favorite
beautiful Lipsey's it's more like just
like going around someone kind of front
room really
it's a lot quieter the Unbeatables
there's like a fever and you can't we
find anywhere else and we'd end up
having like chats with the girls behind
the counter
great friendly yeah the girls are so
nice the girls in the hourglass counter
alike the knife yeah they are so so nice
oh yeah I just I like I can't let
handpicked by you get in there yes very
nice
I also really like John Lewis the 1 and
ops of street something redone yeah it's
yeah good like beauty junkies like
heaven they got everything and it's
really nice be like how its laid out and
there's like a bird becomes today which
is quite hard to find the Birmingham
certainly yeah I yeah I really like the
John most beautiful favorite area for
everything so much shopping eating out
kind of everything you want to do it's
just really hard quite difficult I think
doesn't think oh my god
I was gonna say coming yeah yeah he
doesn't have like the best like it's not
the best as our it's not the best but it
just kind of got a bit of everything and
it's not as mentors walking around like
you're an opposite Street in that sort
of area it's like a really good place to
take what my mom came up a few weekends
going it's just a nice place to just
kind of see a bit of everything with
like street performers like which made
me watch I was like yeah this is
hilarious and there's just a bit of
everything there like giving me that we
both feed that quite a few times yeah
they've got all like the obvious like
micro moments will happen and
restaurants and and O's and they've got
a few like huge in Germany as well yeah
it bills are sent I like that little
courtyard that bill
yes Italian man yeah and I'm normally
like hmm oh oh you know it's a ain't no
one Monica go up to the third floor I
don't want any people this actually I
don't really think you secretly told me
and then I was like oh no an H now it's
normal H&amp;amp;M trend and it's like the best
stuff from H&amp;amp;M and then ones I brought
that anytime you but not that is like in
no one there remark like yeah I buy
that's really nice it is the best
all-rounder a favorite Park for walks I
think mine your behalf that heat because
it's so massive that it back from so
many nice area
at Hampstead South angry Primrose Hill
and you can kind of walk from one end
you know you can start handstand end up
premise hill and go to that London Zoo
which is practically town so I like that
so I'm just like looking down and Louise
made like no sense to me I believe it's
in my frame wake up today
I mean it's like one part that's not
green part yeah well I've been hi Park
but Victoria Park East London Victoria
Park it's really like really nice kind
of walk up to it and like fountains and
ducks and like really nice cafe they do
good pancakes as well our pancakes
anyway this is like a progress coming up
right that's your test or penguin yeah I
say okay I like this question
tip for the truth I think your lungs in
it everyone has their own like tube
things that they used to doing I know
you said you had one yeah what's your
tip like it is when you get on the tube
there's the big double doors I know
that's the single door yeah at the end I
go in the single yes the single door was
not always like not as many people going
for those doors yeah sometimes my
favorite seat on the chi this is really
nerdy it's like the bit where you can
kind of prop yourself up like one the
end yeah on the end there's like a bit
of a cushion bit by the window is either
end you just kind of pops up up or
you've got a lot of shopping so that's
like hanging around me yeah definitely
going for the tiny doors and I always
give the single door when I get on a lot
of you like stands at the bit where I
stand I go straight down the aisle even
if all the seats are taken stand with
everything the island then you'll be the
first ones get to see where someone gets
yeah you might get it if you're over
there also I think it's depends on I
watching you get and have to really get
to know your tube line but I always look
out for the boys and the girls and
uniforms because if you know that oh my
god the super Ghazi it's up okay this
makes sense tonight's not make sense
like okay beautiful I was known as a
write-in Fitness station and it's
kidding any like only some people got
that stations with school time you
couldn't stand by them because they're
gonna get off of the next stop and then
you get that seat that is G via really I
love sitting I just don't want to stand
when our journey
I used to be like oh no like wise people
see it like I don't like sitting there
for OTC okay again without an IV because
it's like you have to try everyone here
I'll check everyone becomes on but it's
really like awkward you never know you
like whether you should stand I don't
want to be a tube me if there's like a
pregnant lady I would lady and no one's
given them see I don't know what to put
on excuse me can you stand up good like
I think thanks don't you feel like you
wanna end me yeah okay next on what
would your perfect day out in London
include it would be like the combination
of everything spoke is actually like
breakfast appears many like walk around
Park me up with a Boris bike a few
weekends ago I know what a nice I mean
that's so difficult to ride like I
hadn't ridden the bike he is it I was
like going down like their own little
militia but I quite cheap and maybe like
a nice breakfast then like a ride on the
bike like along a nice before awesome
it's nice to get the forest I like I
like to get the Boris bikes from Camden
which is kind of where they start and
then you can let you ride it all the way
to Soho which isn't even that far and
it's like kind of feel that you've gone
far and then like have lunch the time
and I think it's nice alternative way of
travelling yeah it's nice to get some
markets I like Camden Market
bara market as well laughing I'm so good
really nice really nice Brent place
called gales
yeah lots of chain yeah yeah I read
about you in London Evening Standard
which I like to read lots of cafes and
markets and riding bikes yeah and I love
what staying out all day all night
having a hold down favorite gallery or /
Museum
mine would be sarchie gathering which is
Kensington and which is started by
Charles Saatchi from like sup she's
actually advertising agency yes and it's
really cool then it's kind of not just
like paintings they had like an oil room
once where you walk in and the whole
room is filled with oil so it looks like
it's like a massive mirror it's also
like reflective you kind of don't know
whether and if they're waiting and then
walk down you can like standing like
amongst the whole all the oil it's just
the most amazing thing it's really like
that and I know how much i n't people
and there's always crazy things stylus
magazine actually had their office there
for two weeks they were gonna get
actually I I really I've definitely
recommend searching I think I have to
pick one
it's like we talked about this earlier I
was like I don't know to fit for this
one and then he was like oh first of all
it's just it's just so much fun you like
Slimer that I think I'm a bit in science

taken a like because people will be
heads like looking at dogs like families

cool and I didn't even just read about
it on a website and I was like it's
really nice it's really cool so yeah
definitely that I was think likeness I
didn't know what to do but I think um my
London secret would be secret cinema
which is also going to do then yeah it's
also called a future cinema that's
there's - the secret cinema is basically
where you don't get told the film and
you gotta sit here I think okay secret
the future cinema the other night you
basically you sign up a new buy ticket
and you get told that I sign it I went
to us Greece and you get told by the
film is Greece and you have to come
dressed up as the film and then the
whole thing's like being like themed
yeah so we were outside in a field and
it was like in the ending scene of
Greece and it's just amazing there's
Google future cinemas it's the best
thing ever I love it and the last
question is favorite bar or Club Avenue
- that many given them quite new to his
like otherwise would have been like a
real pain in the ass to get home I
didn't hurt or would wake up but we went
out like a few weekends ago friends yeah
- floripa in short it and it was just
like a really unexpectedly cool really
nice really cool clearly had food there
me and my friend just turned up the
drinks I'm basically they like take away
all the tables and everyone just like
