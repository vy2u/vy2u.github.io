another beauty chat video and here with
Anna hello and tell you actually doing
them and the house it's a on beauty and
not many get attacked I'm so it mix it
up a bit you know yeah I mean why not
for there so we asked you guys on
Twitter to send us lots of non Beauty
questions and I have 10 here and then we
have a little kind of special bit at the
end the quick fire round yeah exactly
okay so the first question is if you
could choose any cities to live in
except London which city would it be and
why aside from my home town of Brighton
which is home for me
it's got to be New York saying I just
feel like it's the one place that I
visit and I'm like yeah I could I could
do this
yeah we're interested five days a year
this time when I just wrote me didn't do
like touristy stuff because we've both
been there so we could just kind of
chill out we've stayed an apartment on a
committee imagine what it's like to live
there and not yeah yeah it's real good
vibe really good good food good shopping
mmm
priority what are your favourite songs
at the moment okay I've got some okay
okay it's by a guy called Hoodie Allen
have you heard it no and it's got ed
Sheeran like Woody Allen weren't hoodie
hoodie yeah I'm sure about name and it's
got ed Sheeran in it oh cool you would
definitely like it I want to hear it
yeah how's it go I was just telling
really actually laughs like me and Mark
had this like weird just like yearning
to listen to music from our youth and so
we listened to Big Brother's new flow
nice cheese's big bro taking over the
show I mean the new flow you need to
listen up and hear this Shane fit I
don't know my favorite song is but I'm
liking two albums at the moment maroon 5
and it looks like a V bum it might stand
for like 5 or was it where it was V in
like 5 5 yes Oh like maroon 5 so I like
that album and first aid kit which I
discovered in New York and I really like
them and that you'd like it to
okay so look if it gets what I'm liking
would you guys have gotten along at
school or uni yes we say this a lot I
don't know no see you're quite similar
- like my best friend from home Mel yeah
Mellon Lily a very very similar I think
I mean I think we would get on in most
situations but Anna's very nerdy nerdy I
am no D in some ways but like school and
uni learning I was like just fan the
whole thing so hard and when I saw
people who like doing really well I just
feel like oh wait maybe I would have
been like my bad girlfriend you know it
when there's like a girl you're like
your parents late for mission hang yeah
I would have hung around with you just
to be like naughty if you could eat
lunch with one famous person who would
it be going you go I think all my like
idols are just people that you guys
wouldn't know or care about so I'm going
to think of someone like new I think
last night I went to see Celebrity Juice
and keith lemon was hilarious and he
just I think one of the few people
probably make me laugh out loud I never
laugh out loud I know this Lily's a
laugh I was like like laughing and so I
think lunch with him would be very funny
I've noticed in any kind of situation if
I had the opportunity to have anything
with a celebrity it's always Ryan
Gosling Amy okay thank you what Oh God
not like that this always got to be
right but I just
and now he's a father like there's
something about that it looks like I'd
judy's I've got good chat as a luncheon
right cha yeah I think so yeah I think
I've watched a lot of India Artie I wish
a lot of into ease of them sometimes
like YouTube takes me to some weird
places and he's very funny oh you sound
like a lobster yeah favourite Christmas
film elf yeah or Miracle on 34th Street
that reminds me of my childhood my
gorgeous earrings one with a little girl
from the tills they're in it no that's
like that's more of a bubble crystal
what else more like modern fun more
easily Alex oh no no I think it's about
10 years old now but never - Wall Street
is like 20 years old okay
elf is like one of those ones but me and
my sister we watch it and like we know
the whole script yeah like off her I
watch over mine um I would like a think
right now is buddy the oh my favorite
girl little bit where he does the butt
over here
did you hear
I was watching baby last weekend there's
a bit wavelet eating spaghetti but like
sweets and maybe I love that baby like
I'm watching with a kid before and he's
like oh my god I can't believe it
I also like it when he's dancing at the
post office please be okay
actually there's another funny bit oh
it's gone
just wait no quickly go Santa's coming
the next question is how do you deal
with period pains this is a very
different I'm a vile human being
I'm the surprise in it every month you
would have thought it's that the first
time I've ever had it I'm like I cry
like once a month I get shocked I might
tell you I'm like bitches like Lily do
you not understand how I know like you
just died I cry once a month about four
days before and it would be really it
would be really like over a stupid thing
I'm like what March is like looks at me
he knows but then if he says like Annie
you know why you're crying it's a
hormone and quite then that makes me
even more angry and then it's just not
good but in terms of period pain I feel
like as I've got older it's got not as
bad and yeah I guess I'm not like George
neurofen and a hot bath and a hot water
bottle hot water bottle drugs new
friends all about the drugs also a bit
of a bit of like casual working out
because sometimes work wonders oh no
sadly we'll say ah I don't know maybe
like oh my god know what if any on this
sofa put one else
what do you series are you really into
at the moment and it doesn't watch TV no
I don't that is quite a feat so I
watched all of RuPaul's Drag Race all
six seasons now I've gone on to
America's Next Top Model
they've got men in it now yeah if Gotham
guys it's like a TV series I'm talking
like like in like every week you watch
it for like an hour like a popper and
name the west wing me and martyr going
through through the whole series of
thing one about series for gogglebox
I love God
if I'm my favorite thing one time my
mom's the first time I watch ever
someone who didn't know what it was she
was like are we really watching people
watch TV
I definitely one asked my family that
likes everyone I was like why how would
you watch this fight like all the
possible yeah oh yeah we were brought up
with a sausage dog and they danced when
the Reuben I like how they hold hands
like this yeah
I was watching the vampire dies and
loved it but we haven't got the second
seconds like fifth or six whatever the
next season it hasn't come on TV in the
UK yet and I know it's Grey's Anatomy
and I quite like homeland my serious
ones I do tend to go online sometimes I
see it like a rabbit online I might like
to watch the Mindy project modern family
and me go I love modern family I went
off new girl once yeah once once she and
Nick and how I got together it got
boring and then they ya don't wanna give
any like Wailers away but pretty sure
you just spoiled it less they like they
talked toilet paper together
what song reminds you of each other wait
I think we should sing at the same time
in case it's same one ready
yeah baby Whitney no time alone that me
needs just be oh yeah I guess I could
too
I could take my zeal a enemy yeah please
what that that came on in the car and
with none of us realized that we all
like had this obsession with the sony
blu contrail featuring Sean Paul breathe
so it was a kid Alexei going oh oh you
know you're like what for that was when
we come on him you can do it put it back
and do it how you doing buddy do it
I was gonna say another one though this
is more like a private joke why do but a
little bit every time you are me also no
doubt don't speak it's like both are
karaoke songs and when we discovered
that we like we really sang it didn't we
lit all that time yeah I like that one
too so yeah everybody had to go on
celeb which I love by the way do you
watch that but joy I can't watch it
because I always have to eat testicles
and then that's sick
like we know everything if you had to go
and I'm celeb and got to pick for
youtubers to be in your camp who could
they be I haven't thought about this one
owned anything great Faisal the first on
the coast of mind is Sam from pixie oh I
just think she is like a top cookie and
 yeah
he's have a chef okay okay I thought
okay right my fault
oh no okay you because I felt like he
would get done like I would just
get things up I'm fun for Louie yes
you know he's outside adventurous kind
of guy like he would know how to build a
shelter but if his camera ran out of
charge and he couldn't charge it would
be really long he'd be like where's wife
maybe need to shut down if he's gone
I wouldn't exist then Daily Grace
because she makes me laugh so in terms
of like funny
keeping everybody upbeat I think you
should be good also you know I feel like
she would also get stuff done yeah and
then fifth person any of the guys have
sorted food yeah they'd be able to sort
out like food things ya know like you I
can't from for Louie like away
absolutely do something um I think Tyler
Oakley because he's always light in the
head and everyone's feeling a bit grumpy
yeah and Sam would be my fourth because
I just think she's cool chick yeah
agreed
if you had to create a cocktail what
would it be and what would be in it what
would you call it I actually have a life
wait I need a noise really have you put
these questions that love that haven't
thought he's so I guess sure I think I
don't even know what I want to see but I
don't have like a drink every time I'm
like what do you recommend I like light
key in cocktails hmm I think these
questions are more fun when we pre think
about that I would might be really like
this is a really rubbish idea I really
love amaretto sours and but cooler and a
sour
I might like a peddlers punch perfect
they go I don't within it like fruity
punchy okay so now for the end part of
this video I asked you guys to send us

questions and I don't think Alan's seen
these have none so I'm just gonna ask
them and then we both have to answer the
same time jaffa cakes Oreos jaffa cakes
