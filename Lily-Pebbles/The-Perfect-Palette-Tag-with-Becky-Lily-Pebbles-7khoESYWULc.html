hello looks like we've never thought a
video together so this is very exciting
but excuse us for looking quite so
orange we're in a hotel room we haven't
really got any lights in so we're just
gonna go with try to improvise yeah I
flee the sign this day the clouds are
stale
but today we're gonna do the perfect
palate tag which is a real tag but
neither of us have done you've been done
it no but I'm so excited about doing no
I think s they tagged me like a year ago
to do it so sorry yesterday a bit late
to the bandwagon but you saved up some
good palate yeah exactly so we're gonna
go through the questions and pick our
favorite and non favorite palettes
coaster won best packaging you go first
or the guest mine my Marc Jacobs this is
I think it's the Lolita I actually
bought this last year in America and
it's just beautiful first of all I've
kept the case and I never keep cases
it's got a little pocket and it just
it's beautiful I just like almost it's
like a little glasses case yeah I
haven't got one of these save me to
undertake meditation and March 8 clip
sources well I I wasn't sure what its
gonna be like and I love it and I love
neutrals and you'd say that for me was
amazing
nice my best packaging is Charlotte
Tilbury because I think it's just does
the job is really light weights which I
like it feels less luxury because of
that biscuit for traveling the design is
nice it's got a little kind of a magnet
clothes and it's just my favorite one
yeah it's a good size is this your visa
it's just a really good size and there's
no annoying space for a brush that
you're never gonna use yeah I just
really like it you did a good job with
these little I haven't put one of those
in so that's good I love that one okay
the second one is best color payoff
Urban Decay Naked 2 this is my favorite
out of all three and the pigmentation is
the reason why I've chosen this I know
everyone raves about this but with good
reason this is my favorite one because
again neutrals it's so good I love it so
much this is actually my second one
because I brought the oh yeah yeah I hit
pan and on so may the colors this is my
second one
that
making about lag I got completely
through and then a couple of the needles
I'd love it it's just so good I'm
seriously impressed I've never heard any
Malaysian it's so nice energy like
glitter beautiful good old urban decay
mine is as you want to talk about that
often but it's Too Faced chocolate bar
palette I don't use it all the time but
when I do I always forget how amazing
the quality of the Too Faced shadows are
they're very buttery that word we always
use and pigmented just really nice I
really like the shades in here as well
no I said yeah they've got like two bit
like a Big Mac to highlight in a big
shimmery highlight and then we'll the
rest very like new really Wonka
chocolate bar yeah yeah chocolate yeah
tried that it's so good I really like to
face and yeah this is definitely my best
dude what was the question
color payoff smelling palette yeah third
one is most versatile most versatile
keeping it in frame this time this has
to be my stealer stealer stealer is
Mithila my naturalised eyeshadow palette
again for me this has got every color
that I use in plus the fact it's
glittery so this takes me from day to
night so that's why I picked up this one
and yellow eye liner pen which I
actually haven't used but I've used a
separate all of those and they're really
nice the only one I don't use is blue
because I really don't see plea but for
to take me from day to night this one is
really good one that's a good pick mine
is quite hard to find versatile in my
collection because they're all pretty
much needs I did have a few there's big
kind of decay ones of crazy colors but I
don't use them so I ended up giving in
to friends but out of my collection that
I use I think wet and wild and comfort
zone it's probably the most versatile
because it kind of has a bit of
everything it's got your liked highlight
shades Browns pinks and then it's got
some nice creamy tones as well as like
ollie because yeah olivey and then like
a darker like you're a bit like Mac Club
which I really love yeah um that's
actually a nice blue though I feel like
a lot of Blues on me look like it was
like a greeny Brown yeah it's really
nice I really like this palette is very
affordable but you're going to get it in
America all you can't get in the UK but
there that's my most versatile was
really a fall otherwise actually really
really get I try it for the first
this year that was amazing then we have
best for travel I picked my Urban Decay
Naked basics I was torn actually between
this and another mini Marc Jacobs one
but seeing as I play safe all the time
if I can get in and the fact is it's
just teeny tiny and it's perfect and
again when I'm traveling I'm not really
bothering too much about really creative
eyes so I've got everything I need to do
at a time one or a smoky eye and it's so
mini it is doing it I wasn't mattified
that one but then I knew I really liked
really yeah you why do you like this but
it really use black and also the two
shows on the left I wouldn't use but to
basically sit nice it Baker convicted
but whatever the ride is the second one
I preferred I'm watching purchase yeah
it's a good one my pick is from Clinique
and this humble it's called neutral
territory too and it's very small and
sleek I really love the package it's
really nice and then inside it's got
loads of new chase but it does go quite
smoky which I like because then if you
are taking away you can wear some shades
in the evening most of the machinery is
a couple of Matt's
I prefer shimmery eyeshadows anyway it
comes with a little brush just it's just
so cool enough feel it oh it's like yeah
it's really light put those nails and it
looks beautiful on the outside okay
number five biggest regret I'm torn with
this one because it's a Laura Mercier
and I am a huge fan of the bases in
terms of foundations and concealers but
I bought this which is basically you
create your own eye palette so I got
colors that I love wearing and I just
wasn't impressed at all with it the
pigmentation wasn't great on the colors
that I chose the black you can see like
I've tried to go at it and it's not
really doesn't really come off that well
like you can rub your finger on it
it's not yeah that's hairy oh I just
I've never used it and it's just not I
don't think the pigmentation is great
for it so I love the idea of having like
my personalized water Laura Mercier
stuff I love but those eyeshadows were a
big no-no so it just stays in the back
shei maybe they'll reformulate at some
point it should I'm Yuka anything either
I've never go to an ICF it I should know
I didn't and I would never say I've
never really heard anyone rave about
eyeshadows I love all their other stuff
it's a nice idea to make your own
partner yeah my one is from visi art I
actually love this palette but it was so
expensive it was like something terrible
like 70 pounds I can't even believe you
know when you don't really think about
you know any what so so much and I've
seen as I was trailing youtuber took
notes all the time you can't get it in
the UK and then I saw a shop that had it
and the price has kind of missed me yeah
you're just like oh maybe it is I mean
it's amazing it's all mad we've used to
a little bit get good use out of it it's
nice to have all these nice matte shades
but oh my god it was so as I say all
funny I can't no I would never
I know spend that on anything on clothes
or anything I think I just made me feel
my love arty colors oh my god terrible
it's an amazing palette especially if
you're makeup artists but I definitely
didn't need it I love it I'm going virus
that I actually bought this
the next question is best color names um
okay mine was the Urban Decay smoked
eyeshadow palette which have to say case
you wonder what's happened in Jerry's
brokerage he's traveled it looks like
ooh like those are the feel I am it's
very Endor tree and then it makes it
good luck God maybe that's not seven
years because I can't you mirror well
it's okay cuz I don't use this one that
much but I didn't really have amazing
names on my palette so this one is rock
star bar last my mushroom back door
sounds bit loaded I know so I feel like
this is a bit of a letdown so I went
through all of them and none of mine had
particularly amazing names I would have
loved it was like an edible name like
the chocolate ones really cool so yeah
mushroom and that was Maya I cannot
believe that that's my father making you
believe a palatal
I feel like I smashed mirror a long time
ago I was thinking the other day like oh
the 70s is up so my one is from the Too
Faced palette a few of my favorite
things I've never got rid of this just
because I kind of loved it I never to
use it but I just I can't get rid of it
it's like a clutch bag from it this yes
it's like huge and then inside has
wagons are and blushes down here in
loads of shadows up here and again
they're any good quality cuz they're
two-faced but because it's a few of my
favorite things already called yeah
they've got like whiskers on kitchens
and Crisp apple streudel
this is what I'm talking about for name
yeah no not no wings that's so nice
something ponies I love it news yeah
that's performed on some roses blusher
that actually has it again this you win
that one but that one that is definitely
the one because mine cracked
yeah he's very under a tree I did like
the palette anyway Leeson used palette
this was so easy for me it's another
urban decay rod beauty with an edge and
the colors you'll know why
wow so there's a new knife one there's a
couple of nice ones outside she upside
down down this side oh yeah if you're
very creative with your eye colors then
it'll be fine but this has got bright
pink bright purple bright green no it's
not really working I had a fan where
I've been to carry ones like it's always
the bright colored ones I think someone
bought this is a present actually and
it's my biggest regret and still keeping
it this long it's just hope they don't
where it is oh yeah I hope so too I mean
I like this you know a couple of them
are okay I should probably give us a
second chance
look no mind funnily enough wait what
was like the first and second question
me you said naked 2 palette
yeah like favorite yes yeah yeah yeah
color pale mine's naked to Feliz news no
no I mean I pop the actual least use
pallets I've given away but otherwise I
have because I could never get rid of
this yeah are the three naked this is my
least favorite because I naked one
that's my favorite cuz yeah I love naked
one naked 3 I really like because it's
got some really nice kind of rosy pink
yeah / - never lights before but I do
now and this just somewhere in between I
just don't agree with my eyes that's why
that's just it's not you can wear cool
tones like strong yeah yeah a lot of
cool in here and the black is amazing on
that one I love though I really like my
DK in suspect yes I mean I do like the
shadows I just don't know don't reach
for this palette that often I love it so
much
okay so I think the final question it is
not like not me it's time favorite most
used desert island palette gotta have it
with you okay mine breaking away from
eyes is this sleek face for missus
they're contouring and blush palette and
I use this all the time and I absolutely
love it and I Rea practical time you've
got a bronzer a highlighter and a blush
and that's why I picked it because for
me this can be a staple palette I love
all the colors in I love the
pigmentation of it I love the bronzer
because it doesn't have loads of litter
in it the brush is really cute I just
love it I just like it could be an arse
product yeah you know or go yeah yes
Liberty it's really really nice when I
found this I fell in love with it and I
use this all the time through summer
through winter I love is that like one
of their it's always out yeah it's
always there and I saw it the other day
the chocolates there they do a couple of
these ones but this is the contouring
and blush and I love it so much I would
take that with me okay mine is the Urban
Decay Naked one I remember buying this
when I was a holiday in France it was
quite a while after it came out I kind
of always let the hype happen and then I
see but then they sold out but I wanted
it so I actually had to get four in
France to get it and I hate the
packaging but I didn't love the shades I
don't really like velvet makes me feel a
bit better touch it yes I'm I hate it
yeah there's a lot of shades I don't
wear especially the gunmetal and creep I
really like toasted and hustle for like
a perfectly pinky I
I love the middle three half-baked smog
and Dark Horse for bran smokey eye the
new mats are great and the highlights
version is lovely too i reaiiy just love
all these shadows no really good quality
they never crease they blend really
easily I don't even know where my one is
I need to dig out I don't even I that
wasn't even a thing for me I would have
probably picked that one I love it
yeah I did so those are all our palette
favorites and least favorites and I like
that type that ones but I love palettes
I literally that's the one thing I am a
sucker for didn't make you realize no
hairy palettes you have that you don't
use and it's a huge yeah you'll do I'm
gonna give them away with the blue ones
