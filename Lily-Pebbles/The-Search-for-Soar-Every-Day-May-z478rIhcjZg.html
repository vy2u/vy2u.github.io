everyday May I hope you guys are
enjoying it so far I haven't done my
makeup yet as you can see I've just done
my hair but it's Bank Holiday Monday
which means that no one's at work today
I do have a little bit of work to do
this morning though I've got to take
some photos and I might get rich to film
a quick video with me because I need
someone to help me with this one and so
I need to kind of take advantage of the
fact that he's at home I am gonna
quickly epilate to my legs though and I
thought I'd give you guys an update on
how that's going because I mentioned in
my hair removal video that I was gonna
try epilating and I'm so so happy with
the results I used it on my legs and the
hair took like four days to grow back
and normally when I shave it's like
every single day it grows back the next
day just as thick as it was the day
before so I'm really happy it's worth
the pain it is painful B do get used to
it and it's definitely worth it for me
because I don't want to have to do my
legs every day so I'm gonna go do that
now oh it really doesn't hurt as much
the second time that was so easy I'm a
bit obsessed so I'm now going to do my
makeup and my room is such a mess I'm
gonna do my makeup and I think what are
you gonna head to Somerset House because
there's a cool design exhibition on
there and it's quite a nice day and
that's kind of near South Bank so I
think that is our plan so I probably
won't get for my video which is annoying
because then I probably have to do like
a tripod job and I don't think it'll be
as nice but maybe later this afternoon I
don't know we'll see
hey a film to film to my bathroom though
it was so hot in there it was gonna pass
out by the end of it but I've done it
hopefully I'll come out alright I'm
probably can have to edit it tomorrow on
the train but we'll see if not I have to
read film Thursday Friday and I'm back
home I haven't had anything to eat yeah
and it's 5:12 I literally haven't had
anything I'm feeling a bit sick so go
downstairs and find something having
cold pad thai that's gross stop it we're
gonna go have lunch now stubborn we're
gonna head to Somerset house and go to
this design experts exhibition which is
like these nice prints and typography
and stuff like that
then wonder on start bank in that nice
area we're in town and we're gonna walk
over the bridge to south back to grab
some food before coming back yes
there's a huge festival and there are a
lot of people sorry
the hunt for a crack with Nutella and a
coffee so many people who found the
crack plan Nutella and banana cracked my
face
actually there was a really nice prince
I wanted to buy something that I was
burger well decided it and we're now
going to look into coughing father we
wanted to go to the Canon photography
exhibition as well but there was a huge
queue
I think onto the 10th so I might try and
go back and see
when I was taking a piss on me he wants
to know when it will fight a vlog so
he's blocked himself
my dad's a tree vlogging his whole day
just to take the piss out of me I'm now
gonna need some Mac because I want to
see if they've got a strong lip pencil
really okay I've been looking for sawed
off ages without stuff they said order
online when I hate shopping online so
I'm just gonna check in with Ron here
drive home by Western Avenue Street
where's I
I really want to share my in a planet
organic have rough edible insects which
is my sense of general okay there's a
grasshoppers and these are meal worms
those that much easier to eat a little
Christmas Larry wait and see oh my god
there's a co breakfast you move the legs
and wings first well Semillon delicate
not to play of her deep fried tempura -
so true
some of them all communities were 56
percent protein I'm home now and I've
got into my pajamas
I'm feeling really like achy and tired
you know through our problems I need to
pack Paris I'm going tomorrow morning
have I said I'm going to Paris the
Lancome that is why I'm going I'm going
with Anna and we're gonna learn more
about the brand and we're gonna meet
Lisa Eldridge who's their creative
creative director but what someone I've
just admired for years so I think we're
meant to be doing some kind of interview
but we're not like interview people so
hopefully would just be able to sit and
have a chat with her which would be
really nice and me and Anna are gonna
film some videos together while we're
out there so I need to pack but I hate
packing and really hate packing and my
room is a mess like real mess and I have
to tidy my room before I pack because
packing in a mess just means you're
gonna forget something so I'm gonna tidy
up my room now and then pack and then
have dinner and I need to edit today's
vlog I need to schedule some stuff to go
up while I'm away I don't know feel like
I have a lot to do I have a long list of
things make me feel a bit panicky but I
will get it done I will all right
suitcase really is my Samsonite one it's
quite small but I'm only going for the
night it's open been sitting there for
quite a while too far I am watching
vlogs which is kind of distracting but
all I've got in front of me it's just
two pairs of knickers and that's it
that's that's all I've got really not
feeling this whole packing thing kind of
have clothes to wash maybe I shouldn't
pack my makeup that's always quite fun
now this is the annoying thing my
favourite foundation is this Burberry
one I love it and I don't want to take
anything else but it's a huge glass
packaging which is just terrible for
traveling this annoys me I think I'm
going to take this evil armed tinted
moisturizer because it's quite good
packaging for traveling and it's quite
buildable I think I fit pretty much
everything in there brushes
skincare and makeup it's quite a lot in
there though and I bought a red lip just
in case well I am meeting Lisa Eldridge
after all
okay I've kind of nearly packed I'm just
gonna go have some dinner there so I'm
going to end the vlog now we're going to
have porns and noodles tonight oh I
didn't say the highlight of my day
who you forgot highlight of my day was
the design exhibition it was really
interesting I really enjoyed walking
around and seeing all of the prints of
continue vlogging tomorrow see you then

its way Aysen been over here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
