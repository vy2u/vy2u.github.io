realize we have film together since
Christmas which is crazy because we see
each other like every day yeah so we
want to do everything together and we
thought we'd do some kind of summer edit
video and we're going to do part 1 on my
channel and part 2 on Anna's channel and
we've got six categories to go through
we don't know what each other's picked
so it's going to be a complete surprise
and I reckon we're gonna have some
simple if it comes to great lengths to
cover this up so you don't like stuff
like next to us with coats on top we
really do so let's get started so the
first category is makeup and this is one
that I think you might have to but NARS
Laguna bronzer obvious it is too obvious
I can't forget about it it's a soup
obvious one but it just leaves arenas
that sunkissed glowing a cheese it's not
too orange but it's not too cool toned
you can kind of just out of it dimension
to your face and I just love it
my favorite you can contour with it but
you can also just use it as I can
although it's got like a tiny bit
shimmer in yeah and I really like that
it's my second one and there's nothing
better than getting fresh one no my
second does anything so good beautiful
okay so my kind of face product is a new
one from Estee Lauder and it's there
what's it called it's like the she lays
yeah like powder power yeah yeah heat
wave and it's a I literally can never
open this ever very good it's a
highlighter and it looks like there's
some you take the brush out and it's
really really like reflective but it's
just the most gorgeous highlighting you
can use it just like this and like put
it on your cheeks and it leaves like a
really natural trail or you can use it
wet and then it's like really intense
it's just the perfect shampoo I really
like this too I use it on the eye lids
yeah and like an inner corner highlight
it's nice and I love the bronze some
what's called goodness yeah each summer
it's always really good there's always
like one thing that's super good I love
the bronze sands eyeshadow palette yeah
oh that's really nice that's pretty nice
and this is like the standout from this
year I'd say I love it's really really
nice I've got cheek another cheek
product going a bit well fati pull up is
this from RMS Beauty and I didn't want
to try
it's like I should really like it it's
their lip to cheek and this isn't shade
smile that's quite a few of them but
this is just like peachy pink so nice
good man to know how much others things
like 25 baby but you can use it it's one
of those ones you know when they say you
can use it on your lips and cheeks yeah
sometimes it's like to drive to use on
your cheeks or little you know it just
doesn't work for this it's the perfect
consistency for a bit of both and I just
love the shade bit and it's leaves like
quite a fresh little connection it's a
really nice really like that HD color
good too like throwing a bag that super
small yeah I'm laughing because we're so
similar I thought my Revlon Photoready
whatever it's called coral reef cream
blush because these are just really easy
to getting it in Boots super drug and I
love this color it's like proper coral
it's quite alright that's a bit more
nice stuff delivery date okay yeah it
doesn't really come out that bright and
it goes quite powdery when you put it on
it's really easy to wear and just really
affordable and I like this I do have
like other favorite cream blushes I
really like the Stila wasn't you maybe
but I'm loving an Armani one at the
moment as well and the Kevyn Aucoin one
yeah yeah there's a lot but just getting
the cream blush this is a really good
one to try it's really easy to use it's
really affordable was rice placed on can
i interject with like a third sorry so
sorry there wasn't just one more and
it's quite like a recent purchase so I
didn't want to go like too crazy but
this dinners like one of the main two
but the Dior skin need BB cream and they
this is amazing it's a really really
light Rider
the other day my or yesterday my makeup
is just completely melted off I look
like I was wearing nothing and then I
got on the cheap and I was going out for
dinner and I would put this on smothered
it all over my face and then the girl
who I went out to dinner with said that
my face look really no amazing that's
how you know amazing that's how you know
that it's good product I just put this
on my fingers I've got shade too and it
just seemed really glowy and fresh and
I've got a feeling I'm kind of
pre-empting it as a sum of a that's why
I don't want me Aldridge she just used
it I was like oh it's on the shopping
list for about ten minutes
I'm gonna listen because around it is so
my lifestyle products are still quite
beauty related but it's thing that we
haven't kind of got category for so I
don't know it was really hard on yes I
think some of my pics might not fit the
brief I know what I was thinking that
candles but I've so got candles a lot
listening anyway my first one is similar
to the first thing I so grinders and
other products from there oh yeah every
I and I'm really going crazy unless they
lured here at the moment but this is a
perfume and they bring out a different
one every year like different packaging
and I think the sense sometimes slightly
different as well they bring out like
the original bronze good yes every year
and then they bring out like a kind of
easier no one is there
I think I think I don't think this is
them
no because it's alright I really like
this one I think I even refer to the
originally this is this year's version
of yes it's basically perfume that
smells like this how I've described at
my blog face it sounds like you're on a
deserted Caribbean beach of white sand
oh it does it it's like holiday it's
like some cream and it's some cream it's
not kind of like Italy
it's like pina colada on some cream it's
together which is really not the kind of
thing I normally like but it's not too
sweet
yes surprise that I know you just may
seem like on holiday give it I know but
I love this like like every specially
now the weather's not so great anymore
in London I just like to put this on all
right yeah I like I'm Angie I thought
you'd bring fragrance I just thought you
had it very good I know you said about
candles earlier but I know exactly the
one but not on my TV it's from the teak
and it could mint
say Oh like Greenman oh yeah oh it
doesn't smell minty I've been learning
quite a lot of canons recently I know
it's summer it's like not really the
most ice under any more year round
Oh year round like why not and it's
quite fresh it's not too heavy like
something musky and spicy like you
usually burn in the winter and I just
actually I smelt it at the deep teak
shop and they burnt it with lemon Lee oh
fresh kind of green smelling ones love a
good candle yeah it smells good or so
quickly they do I think I've got in this
light it's quite a long time and it's a
good weight to my chest they're out
there you're gonna go and get ya in
straightaway yeah exactly and I find
that they smell even when they're just
on the side and they're not burning yeah
yeah they do there you go okay so my
next one is a gradual tanner and I think
what is yesterday with you and I tried
it last night and I'm already in love I
know of any tried it once
so you Instagram at this morning I
really like it yeah everyone like reply
it's basically it's just like a body
moisturizer that's a graduate analyst
for Palmer's natural ones that did not
say anything I got excited and I used a
mitt to apply it because I'm really
rubbish it's a tiny team the way yeah I
solicit it to be like no streaks and
stuff and I really like it I put it on
the afternoon in the next morning you
can see how to really nice tan and
everyone commented on my history I'm
saying is stinks but I I just think
smells like cocoa butter well do I smell
like it sometimes you really have to get
like probably place yeah I don't know I
think my lane of things I think it
smells like coconuts if you like that
kind of sweet smell that sort of smells
like and but yeah I really like it I'm
gonna have to give this a go you should
just like it used a penalty as well
really cheap if you're new to tanning I
definitely recommend this it's just like
moisturizing yeah
okay the next one when we decided to do
this video
lifestyle there wasn't really much of a
like brief for it I think I've kind of
gone like off breathe with what with
what I've chosen for this but it is a
lego man ice cube tray oh you might get
your ice cubes come out with a little
like Lego man like the little Lego
bottles
oh man they actually did like your shirt
from that side they actually have a
little legs together from the Lego shop
where's the Lego shop that's always when
you've got a boyfriend that's obsessed
with Lego you trust me I've always been
the Lego shop dividers to be I think my
mum was good for him so good but I
really like it it just adds a bit of fun
service really
that's definitely more like something oh
that's right yeah there you go
for the final category we thought we'd
pick our favorite summer food and drink
and they have been melting next to us
throughout this whole video yeah so
lollies not easily oh my god mine so
melted smudge identity to infinite
potato it might like Jeep hey wait I
can't open my first one but mine's
twister
I love twisted I love sister but uh do
you lick off yeah yeah all the way
mine's really submerged and melted but
so good I love toasters and going this
way all the way and I'm actually quite
happy that this has melted down because
there's nothing left really achieves the
bottom i'm is quite similar my um yeah i
could pick one my beaner
