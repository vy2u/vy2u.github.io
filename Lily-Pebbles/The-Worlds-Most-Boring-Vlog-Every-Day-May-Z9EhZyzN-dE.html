now because I have my yogurt this is the
last one out of all of those ones I
bought which is a little bit sad but I'm
really enjoying it and also i just got
my post and i got some biscuit ears
biscuits these are my favorite i've had
them before someone has sent me before
let me show you these came with a some
really nice nail polishes from butter
london live like these are all biscuits
how incredible but they'd literally
tastes amazing they're like vanilla read
goodness and is always a great day when
i get a box of fun biscuit ears they are
amazing so I'm gonna keep those on my
desk and those throughout the day I'm
just sitting down to edit yesterday's
blog and then I'm at home all day today
so I don't know how much I'd be able to
vlog but I feel like it's going to be a
productive day I need to film my monkey
makeup routine which is going up sunday
and i need to write some blog posts and
photos my blog is majorly falling behind
during this every day flopping i was
going to just kind of keep mean I really
wanted to keep logging every day but my
post was starting to be really bad and
loads of spelling mistakes and I just
think it's better to not put anything
out there then to plan something really
bad so I haven't posted for a few days
which is probably the first time in
about five years it's ridiculous but
it's very hard to do videos every day
and blog post every day but i do want to
continue do blog posts every day i think
i just kind of fell behind so i'm going
to try and use a blog post later on
today edit some videos just get lots of
work done and then tonight i'm seeing my
friend Jemma who is the one that got
engaged oh my god so many comments is it
anna is a key sure it's Gemma and I want
to see my friend Deb's as well we're
going to get together and have a little
girly evening see I need to get on with
some work now and edit this vlog or my
sister and honey I've just got here and
I can't resist going mouse toes and
playing with her it's just just just too
cute honey's doing a little drawing what
are you drawing ok all the pretty colors
ok i'm going to start prepping to film a
video so usually the first thing i do is
get all the products together that I
want to use I'm going to put them in
I've got a little oh gosh
love stuff already we use this and pop
it up here and we're going to Philip
stuff so I can take it down to film ok
I'm going to hopefully show some other
options of products in this video as
well so I've got quite a lot I hope some
to take these downstairs to film so I've
got all the products here and I've just
set up this light here this light here
put all the cushions there which i'm so
bored of these cushions i can't wait to
get new ones and a camera here and light
here this is obviously not my bedroom
this is my parents bedroom and i'm not
going to go into why i live at home with
my parents when I'm 27 years old I'm
sure you guys are clever enough to
figure out but it won't be too long to
have my own place and that's very
exciting so I'm going to film this now
it's just one of my monthly makeup
routine videos so it's the whole point
is i'm just showing your makeup that
i've been wearing a lot this month so
you guys watching these vlogs will know
what it looks like because i've been
wearing it throughout this month of
every day may so it should be quite easy
i'm just going to sit and chat and put
my makeup on and hopefully you guys will
enjoy it so i might pop you up over here
so you can watch
you
I finished roaming I'm just going to do
the cutaways this is the most boring bit
i'm going to leave everything set up
just in case I have to re-film anything
and I'm gonna take a memory card now
yeah go put it into my computer here now
I'm gonna spend the next I reckon like
45 minutes to an hour editing it won't
be that long because it's quite simple
one to edit so I'm just gonna sit here
edit that see how I guess you never know
to sit down like what it kind of really
looks like my necklace is a bit wonky
and I've got like lip gunk the side of
my lips that is really gross I can't
edit videos with lipstick on have to
take this off a sort of in mount my dad
just phoned to say he's gonna bring some
lunch home for me so that's pretty
excited to it means I literally daft
leave the house even get food somehow
ended up with this like thai green curry
which is definitely such a piggy thing
to eat for lunch but it smells so good
oh my God look at this weather
hailstones you see those what the hell
is that it's me can you hear it my least
favorite bit to edit in these videos is
the posy showing off the makeup bit I
literally want to punch my face that's
how annoying I think I am oh my god I
literally looks like it's snowing this
is so bizarre as the world ending I've
been having a super lazy day and just
feeling very non motivated today if
you've been following on snapchat you'll
know but I'm going to take a couple of
blog photos now I probably won't have
time to write the post before tomorrow
but I'm going to take some photos with
these Lancome Lancome lipsticks that i
really like 35 4 and 2 12 and that but
really nice note to self don't take
photos when you're pissed off I mean
look at that one I look so angry I'm
gonna leave mine now and hits Gemma's
I'm in comfy clothes because I think we
got to stay name with your friends I
just I don't want to wear jeans sounds

feeling like I need to be lifted up by
my friends though it would be nice to
hang with them we're going to make some
dinner pao chicken burgers and sweet
potato fries around the menu Cordys

probably been the world's most boring
vlog I might even use up the title I
haven't done anything and I felt really
tired all day I thought I was getting
ill but I think it might just be down to
rich waking up at 4am to go to Germany
and kind of disrupting my sleep I had a
nice evening though with Deb's and Gemma
catching up talking all things diamond
rings and weddings which is always fun
for our skills highlight of my day was
getting to see Deb's because I haven't
seen her for a while and she is one of
my best friends I've had a lot of
comments being like I thought this
