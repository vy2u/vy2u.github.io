now because I have my yogurt this is the
last one out of all of those ones that I
bought which is a little bit sad but I'm
really enjoying it and also I just got
my post and I got some biscuit ears
biscuits these are my favorite I've had
them before someone has satins me before
let me show you these came with some
really nice nail polishes from butter
LONDON
these are all biscuits how incredible
but they literally taste amazing they're
like vanilla
goodness and is always a great day when
I get a box of fun biscuit ears they are
amazing so I'm gonna keep those in my
desk and that's throughout the day I'm
just sitting down to edit yesterday's
vlog and then I'm at home all day today
so I don't know how much I'd be able to
vlog but I feel like it's gonna be a
productive day I need to film my monkey
makeup routine which is going up Sunday
and I need to write some blog posts here
some photos my blog has majorly fallen
behind during this everyday vlogging I
was going to just kind of keep I mean I
really wanted to keep blogging every day
but my post was starting to be really
bad and loads of spelling mistakes and I
just think it's better to not put
anything out there than to power up
something really bad so I haven't posted
for a few days which is probably the
first time in about five years it's
ridiculous but it's very hard to do
videos every day and blog posts every
day but I do want to continue do blog
posts every day I think I just kind of
fell behind so I'm gonna try and do some
blog posts later on today edit some
videos just get lots of work done and
then tonight I'm seeing my friend Jemma
who is the one that got engaged oh my
gosh so many comments is it Anna is a
Keisha it's Gemma and I want to see my
friend Deb's as well we were going to
get together and have a little girly
evening see I need to get on with some
work now and edit this vlog well my
sister and honey have just got here and
I can't resist going mouse toes and
playing with her it's just she's just
too cute honeys doing a little drawing
what you drawing
okay all pretty colors okay I'm gonna
start prepping to film a video so
usually the first thing I do is get well
put us together that I want to use I'm
going to put them in I've got a little
oh gosh that's full of stuff already I'm
gonna use this pop-up here and I'm just
gonna fill it for stuff so I can take it
down to film okay I'm gonna hopefully
show you some other options of products
in this video as well so I've got quite
a lot I hope some people take these
downstairs to film so I've got all the
products here and I've just set up this
light here this light here put all the
cushions there but I'm so bored with
these cushions I can't wait to get new
ones and a camera here and light here
this is obviously not my bedroom this is
my parents bedroom and I'm not going to
go into why I live at home to my parents
when I'm 27 years old I'm sure you guys
are clever enough to figure it out but
it won't be too long until I have my own
place and that's very exciting so I'm
gonna film this now it's just one of my
monthly makeup routine videos so it's
the whole point is I'm just showing you
makeup that I've been wearing a lot this
month so you guys watching these vlogs
will know what it looks like because
I've been wearing it throughout this
month of everyday May so it should be
quite easy I'm just gonna sit and chat
and put my makeup on and hopefully you
guys will enjoy it so I might pop you up
over here so you can watch
I finished roaming I'm just gonna do the
cutaways this is the most boring bit I'm
gonna leave everything set up just in
case I have to refill many thing but I'm
gonna take your memory card now yeah go
put it into my computer here now I'm
gonna spend the next
I reckon like 45 minutes to an hour
editing it won't be that long because
it's quite simple one to edit so just
let's sit here edit that's see how I
guess you never know to sit down like
what it kind of really looks like my
necklace is a bit wonky and I've got
like lip gunk the side of my lips that
is really gross I can't edit videos with
lipstick on have to take this off a
certain amount
my dad just phoned to say he's gonna
bring some lunch home for me so that's
pretty excited too it means I literally
- leave the house even to get food
somehow ends it up with this like Thai
green curry
it's definitely such a piggy thing to
eat for lunch but it smells so good
oh my God look at this weather
hailstones you see those what the hell
is that
it's me can you hear him my least
favorite bits edit in these videos is
the Posie showing off the make up bit I
literally want to punch my face that's
how annoying I think I am oh my god I
literally looks like it's snowing this
is so bizarre as the world ending I've
been having a super lazy day and just
feeling very non motivated today if
you've been following on snapchat you'll
know but I'm gonna take a couple of blog
photos now I probably won't have time to
write the post before tomorrow but I'm
gonna take some photos with these
Lancome Lancome lipsticks that I really
like three five four and two one two
there but really nice note to self don't
take photos when you're pissed off I
mean look at that one I look so angry
I'm gonna leave mine now and it's
Gemma's I'm in comfy clothes because I
think when you're just a name with your
friends I just I don't want to wear
jeans sounds horrendous so my choice of
Watson's I'm feeling like I need to be
lifted up by my friends though it would
be nice to hang with them we're gonna
make some dinner
pouchy can burgers and sweet potato
fries around the menu
Cordys Jemma oh by the way if I ever
shown you this this is like hilarious is
this was my first ever teddy bear who is
called Todd one minute yeah I named him
Todd
is 27 years old that teddy bear and this
is what my I don't know if I've ever
shown this in a vlog my uncle when he
came to visit me in the hospital when I
was born he bought this
he worked in advertising and his friend
like juror it for him and it says but
congratulations lots of love uncle
Richard that's my little pebbles thing
sits there alongside Todd I just
realized I did that whole bit with my
lips like this and forgot to say why
I've just like smothered on like a lip
balms my lips are so saw at the moment
and I had a bit of lipstick on so it's
turned into some sort of a pink weird
like you need face look just at Gemma's
now and I think she's making some
guacamole yep this is what she's been
mixing up guacamole this general what's
this well it was gonna be quinoa and
then I accidentally poured the couscous
in without looking yeah so it's good
salmon or hey now he's fixing your hair
we're having chicken burgers Christus
lettuce guacamole yeah onions onions and
sweet potato fries in case you didn't
guess Jemma is the friend getting
engaged I wasn't gonna talk about cuz I
know it's part of it but all my friends
like want you guys to know about their
lives say oh not getting engaged is
engaged to be married till ago her cards
she's got so many nice engaged cards

singing my lungs out to magic radio
she's my favorite thing to do when I'm
driving by myself I might still be on my
snapchat if you want to go have a watch
was wasn't very entertaining this has
probably been the world's most boring
vlog I might even use up the title I
haven't done anything and I felt really
tired all day I thought I was getting
ill but I think it might just be down to
rich waking up at 4 a.m. to go to
Germany I'm kind of disrupting my sleep
I had a nice evening though with Deb's
and Jemma just catching up talking all
things diamond rings and weddings which
is always fun first girls highlight of
my day was getting to see Deb's because
I haven't seen her for a while and she
is one of my best friends I've had a lot
of comments being like I thought this
person was your best friend I thought
this person's I've got lots of best
friends I've known forever Deb's Hannah

lots of best friends I'm very lucky and
I love that you all left marinas

Hannah I know you guys will love her she
is amazing
I've known Hannah since I was born she's
actually the reason I was born she lives
next door to me what she did growing up
and my mum went round to see her and she
was born and went oh I want to have
another baby and then out popped me nine
months later so all thanks to Hannah but
yes she's like my best best friend
and she's a year older than me so I
always really looked up to her growing
up and I feel like she's the reason I
talk I was so shy when I was younger and
as you can see she's so confident and
amazing so yes I love her too and I
really want to do a video soon with all
my friends because you guys really like
them and I think they're just I want to
show them off because they were so
talented and amazing so I'll try and
think of some video I can do with all of
