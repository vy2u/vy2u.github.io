this is going to be very different to
anything I've ever done it's not a
beauty video and I'm a little bit
nervous about putting this up but I
really hope you guys enjoy it
I noticed recently that I've been
getting a lot of comments on my videos
which are lovely so thank you but
they're saying things like you're so
perfect I wish I was as confident as you
I wish I had your life and I just feel
the need to address that I am 26 years
old and some of you guys are very young
you're like fifteen sixteen years old
and when I was your age I was not like
this I didn't look like this I didn't
talk nervous I didn't act like this and
I think it's quite important
talk about teenage years and having
confidence so I roped in a few of my
very very best friends that I've known
my whole life to talk about how they
were when they were teenagers and how
they feel differently now what their
insecurities were and how they kind of
meeting selves feel confident now so I
hope you find it interesting or maybe
helpful or just kind of entertaining to
watch and meet all my best friends so
I'm going to ask them a few questions
and I'm going to answer them too so tell
me about your 15 year old self I was not
very cool though like my 15 year old son
was so different from my 26 from self 15
year old me strong-minded maybe bit too
outspoken I think I had a mullet when I
was 15 and I was very little very very
ready till 4:00
my age group huge eyebrows like no wax
or tweezers when near those two laws by
1815 I had braces octagonal glasses
which I thought were really nice and
then I had a ponytail like two little
bits coming down very loud but that was
kind of a front because inside I was
just dying I was shy I wasn't shy around
my close friends and family but I
remember my best friend Hannah is older
than me and I remember and she used to
have parties at her house on a Saturday
night I remember going to the parties
and her friends would come up and talk
to me and say hi and I'll just be so
sure I'd literally say hi and I remember
in my head I was screaming God saying
say something Lilly but I couldn't think
of anything to say let's you know words
would just come out my mouth thought I
was really cool actually
clothes icing looking back now feeling
so anxious a lot and wanting everybody
to like me all the time wanting to be
included in everything I used to have a
really big fear of being left out did
you have any insecurities yes I did
actually
my lips there's boys in school to say
like really silly things about it
whereas as I got older I've realized
like it's quite a important part of
myself actually eyebrows being really
skinny yeah definitely being short was
one of my things and my other school I
was out as a girls school and they used
to eat like for the school failure to
line up in in size order and I was
always really upset me and I'm feeling
panic about it and yeah I was really bad
at school like education-wise
I pretty much like failed everything and
to realize I didn't really try that hard
I probably could have done better but I
found everything really confusing I
didn't understand how to revise for
exams I felt like it never really been
taught how I felt like I was always the
one in class to put my hand up so that
was an insecurity for me being like not
as clever as everyone else I don't know
if I think I had more
securities and securities I never got
bullied for having red hair or anything
like that but I always felt really
different from everyone all my friends
with either brown or blond and it was
horrible to be the only one who didn't
look like them was I was so insecure I
was really buried at school I had been
to a lot of different schools because
I've been so buried looks-wise I had a
lot of insecurities I just didn't feel
like I was the pretty one in my
friendship group I felt like all my
friends were a lot prettier than I was
and obviously my hair was a massive
insecurity for me I found it so
stressful and I didn't feel pretty with
that sort of hair because well my
friends had like long blonde straight or
brunette hair and it just looks so nice
like oh you stepped over ginger well
it's like now I love it I don't mind
when I was 15 everybody hated it also
because I am such a dark brunette body
hair comes with that and I know when I
was kind of a younger teen I found
having like hairy arms and like maybe
facial hair and stuff I hadn't really
figured out how to you know I would
never go to get laser or get waxed when
I was about 15 so then I just remember
being really insecure about that when I
had to wear bikini I thought like I felt
like I had quite hairy back compared to
most people it really wasn't Harry I'm
not like some kind of beast but at the
time it was like a huge deal for me and
I remember being really jealous of my
friends who have blond who didn't really
have to worry about things like that
yeah it's definitely just like being
really skinny I got teased a bit because
my school uniform is skirts I tried to
like petition to get trans in just so I
can kind of cover my legs so how did you
find school schools okay I came from a
primary school that I loved and had my
best best friends and then I moved to
this girl's school which is quite strict
and proper so I found that transition of
difficult I hate school now drawn a
picture of school skl and me with the
speech bubble that says I hate you
that's what I thought of school having
quite a strict family background so when
I was at school I felt like I could just
completely be myself and I just no no no
let loose yeah exactly it's a really
tough question because I feel like I
definitely stay at any particular school
for long enough
unfortunately in hindsight I realize now
that that was not particularly sensible
I found school really hard I went to a
girls school and I just felt like I felt
really different yeah I didn't work very
hard I found it hard I felt it really
hard especially when it was coming up to
GCSEs I also had a big group of out of
school friends all the girls you can see
in this video of friends I had from
primary schools so I kind of missed them
a lot when I was in school I remember
always been really stressed about it and
now when I look back I think I was a
little e stressful time of my life this
diary entry Tuesday of a 10th of June
today I went to school Carly who's my
sister took me in had a chemistry test
first which I definitely failed and I
mean failed with the capital F then I
had maths which I thought went really
well
whew it didn't go well I failed hey what
about boys yeah boys were my entire life
for 15 the boys was funny actually um I
was always like the girl that was like
the best friend of the boys boys I had
my first kiss and I was I think 13 and a
half and the boy rode me kiss me we got
to kiss my friend first which is always
give the fish to the old
Southie I had friends that was so pretty
and you know the boys fancied them and I
really really wanted to be that girl but
just wasn't really I was definitely
never the one that the boys fancied it
was a time when all my friends were
getting boyfriends and having their
first kiss and I think I was the last
one to kiss him for a they usually
fancied Keisha which is funny because
she hated the attention that she never
wanted anyone to fancy her but yes it
was a bit walk with them bit shy didn't
like when they came up to me I really
liked boys they didn't really like me
the thing with me is because because I
was loud I've never really I could
always talk to why there was never the
girl that couldn't talk to boys but
always as a friend my best friend at
school and he still my very good friend
blonde very pretty and we would go out
and she's very smiley so she smiles from
ear to ear all the time and my natural
face is like I think it's good for us
teen bitch face so when we would go out
people would was being drawn toward Tara
because obviously she's very beautiful
and very smiley and there'd be me in the
corner like making miserable zone boys
wouldn't really approach me as much I
think we hung out with like a group of
boys but we were we were we're really
young we just I think me and my friends
would would have preferred to be playing
football outside and how the boys but we
thought it was a thing to do so we serve
yeah meet up with these guys and have
evenings in there just a little bit
awkward really how do you feel different
now like personality-wise - back then
like in some ways when you're a teenager
you're so confident because you have
this like invincibility but you think
your events when you can do anything so
you have confidence from that but then
in other ways because that you haven't
grown into yourself at all and don't
know who you are you're brilliant secure
so I feel much more confident in myself
now like with my hair like love having
when 10 hours before Hector I feel a lot
more comfortable with you I am I think
going after your teens you want everyone
to like what you're wearing what you're
doing you want to be in the in-group you
want a piece of you know part of what's
going on and I think now it's you know
what if people don't like we're wearing
or what you said or what you like doing
or care things that you think are the
most important thing then just you kind
of remember like now 10 years later like
five years later I feel like a
completely different person to when I
was 15 16 feel so much more confident to
be different I think that that's the
biggest thing you spend all your
teenager is and even some of the early
parts of my 20s wanting to be like
everybody else and actually being
different it's really cool and having
not doing what everybody else does is
actually really okay I think the main
difference me is that now I just really
don't care what other people think it's
not that I don't value other people's
opinions but it doesn't put me down when
I was younger if someone didn't think I
was pretty or had like a negative
opinion about me I really affects me
whereas now I feel quite happy with who
I am and if there's parts of me that I'm
not happy with that's up to me to change
it it's not up to someone else so not be
happy with it
and what gives you confidence now look
using confidence now think myself having
good energies around you and the love of
your family and of your friends I
laughing it's what makes me feel good
and confident just not taking likes very
seriously and taking it all with a pinch
of salt like knowing who you are and
other sounds really lame and I've just
come from a yoga class I'm getting quite
like them but like just knowing yourself
and when you're 15 you really haven't
grown and I'm 26 I still don't think I
have a complete human yet but definitely
more of Who I am
and I was then I think my job has given
me a lot of confidence I have to meet
people every day different
and so I have to put myself out there I
think it's just kind of believing that
you're good enough to do whatever you
want to do or if you even at this age
because to have insecurities if you say
to yourself I accept myself as I am
imperfections and all I think then
itself gives confidence what gives me
confidence um I don't really know I
think it's to do with the people who
surround me definitely being kind to
yourself I think somebody said that to
me once and and I didn't really
understand what it meant but being kind
to yourself and not giving us off such a
hard time will make you feel more
confident
don't rely on other people to make you
confident because they'll make
themselves confidence up to you to make
yourself confident if you could give
your fifteen year old self any advice
what would you say
just chill chill out a little bit yes
slow down like don't go up too fast
enjoy the moment oh don't get a mile it
again that wasn't a good look smile more
people really appreciate it when you
smile I tell myself to have more
confidence in myself I was always
worried about failing Asha I wasn't even
worried I just kind of knew I would fail
have more confidence in yourself you
know I ended up going to Union doing
pretty well which my 15-yard self which
would never have guessed just it will be
okay
just do your best and try not to think
things through so much in your head I
really remember making huge great big
deals out of things in my head being so
stressed upset and crying endlessly over
things so I think definitely just it's
going to be okay whatever whatever
happens however bad it feels however
huge it feels it will be okay one day
also surround yourself with lovely
people and I did I had some really
amazing best friends but I also allowed
myself to be friends who didn't make me
feel good and that's something I do
differently now I'm quite strict with
who I want in my life and if I meet
someone who I don't like
then I'm not going to kind of pursue the
friendship I like to have people around
me who make me feel good who are lovely
who are caring and I think being around
people who put you down and make you
feel negative whether it's their
insecurities
they're trying to project them to you I
just don't have time for that I don't
want to have a negative kind of insecure
life just go with it don't worry just
take each day that comes
ride ride the little waves of teenage
years because at the end of the day it's
all going to be okay it's all fine and
just be true to yourself be who you are
so I hope you guys enjoyed that leave me

and what you thought of my lovely
friends because I'm so happy they helped
