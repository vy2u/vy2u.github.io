the first day of Easter bank holiday
weekend I don't know if this is a UK
thing that we get Friday and Monday off
work for Easter is like a bank holiday
that's what they call it
I guess what the banks closed which is
always very annoying because I always
need to go to the bank on a bank holiday
but I am starting off my long weekend
with Pilates which I do every Friday
morning so I'm gonna head there now I've
kind of haft on my makeup normally I go
with nothing on but I've done my um kind
of base because when I come back I need
to quickly get ready and head over to
Anna's because we are filming a beach
chat video today and I think rich is
going to come with me as well so I need
to grab some food and head to Pilates
there's nothing in the house for
breakfast so I'm just having much so
with peanut butter but this is a whole
earth peanut butter which two things
like healthy but tastes good a Skippy
rich is coming to Pilates with me
because my mom's not feeling well so
there's an 8 the spot and it's back for
today he just walked down wearing this
there's absolutely no way I'm please
come on then let's go to Pilates you're
in a triathlon top this is very
different
they're about from Pilates I couldn't
really film anything but rich was really
good yeah yeah it's like you use a lot
of muscles and movements I wasn't using
any of sessions yeah I need to do that
more I really it's like little movements
but really targeted makes me realize
that some people who just go to the gym
and do like crazy workouts are probably
just doing it all wrong because it
sounds missing movements that you really
like need to know where your cause and I
don't know my space
I'm gonna go get ready no making food
with Anna's coming with Donna's okay I
am ready to go to Anna's I just need to
do a couple of things before I go then I
think we're off I'm gonna drive because
I felt really carsick the other day when
rich drove so I never feel carsick when
I Drive I don't know what the theory is
there could anyone tell me why when you
drive you don't feel carsick or when
you're the passenger you do well so I've
put in a new set of braces so sorry if
I'm a bit kind of lispy these ones are
really hurting I think I'm getting
towards the end now so they're getting a
bit more like intense and this front
tooth is really hurting me but nice and
straight now just go to Anna's and I'm
so sleepy cuz I fell asleep in the car I
wasn't driving in the end I was the
passenger and I just fell asleep because
that's weapons when I'm in the car and
there's paint in her nail what color is
Baker Street yeah I haven't won it free
to those this is one of your faves I
know that I haven't worn it for ages
we are gonna film a quick beauty shot
and then don't know we haven't be
precise about today what do you want to
do the rest of the day home you're
shopping yeah it is going up for a while
but this is like the only time you Nana
could fill so in case you're thinking
this is a bit pre-filled wow you have
too much spare time
you finished filming and it got weird
like Mouse and nail polish and bikini
line talk explain the see on our news
channel
rich is the hunt for yes so we've put
him in charge of where you want to eat
but luckily he's dead mice are burrito
which people knows I fav I'm gonna try
and just get side dish though because
we're having a big dinner tonight but
all bit hungry so we're gonna grab some
food and then have a little mooch around
town I really feel like a bunch enough
work but I guess everyone else's as well
just be wandering around Selfridges and
I had a voucher and I've been trying to
save it like shoes or something nice
that I could find anything I like
so I got an rmk blusher brush which is
so soft and amazing so happy with it
and I got a couple of those nails they
can use white nail polishes that Alan
loves because they look very excited
about that
so now just wandering around and then
Rick just got off some little boys
Collin really really posh end of Bond
Street
I'm feeling very out of place great
though we just sat on that funny bunch
of the old men who take a photo for
Instagram this one really it started to
rain and last time in my vlog you also a
my umbrella was fallen I don't remember
what that one's from actually this one
with lips on Anna where's my
 feel like you with me no I
don't have any more information I
thought I did today lips elastic was a
flowery umbrella he's got a bit of time
to spare so Phil show Anna a sha like
she's never been here before
I love it we're just gonna get a couple
of teeth we've actually just bought some
crumbles and doughnuts from the food
hook but I'm gonna
here back in the car we just had a
really quick cup of tea at a chalet
which is really nice I thought I'd show
you what I got for Selfridges so I got
the little rmk brush that I was gonna
get Sookie without she'll spoil myself
but they're like the same I mean this is
the powder cheap brush it's all in the
packaging looks like that and I got two
nail polishes the brahmic nails inc I
got Whitehorse Street Whitehorse of our
house Whitehall Street just like that
and Swan the street offer just there's
like minty dreaminess and again here I
got some more Livia's crumbles because
I'm completely obsessed of these I don't
know why I didn't put them on my monthly
favorites they are amazing and I got
this yogurt because it looks like these
to have in France when I was young those
that have like honey on top and I really
want to try that what did you buy from
Selfridges I
Oh God I didn't tell her about a
doughnut least tell them we went through
crosstown donut and there was a
raspberry jam one left
I'm so excited the man in front had
already ordered like five so like oh yes
one left in the UM Oh actually can i buy
one as well and he took the last one I
was a heartbreaker so Anna got her
cinema that was really evil a lot of
even if everything to be better it's
just it's very easy you get to try that
later yesterday I know you think yeah
well and then the Libya's crumble to
nice beyond its crap keen wari kind of
granola and cashew hmm okay good cool
so we're now in High Street can we are
gonna meet up with mark
we're gonna keep ourselves busy for a
couple of hours wandering around and
then we've got a table books ah dirty
babe dirty babies which i think is kind
of like a burglary hot dog place I'm not
sure we've ended up in space and K we've
kind of lost the boys and it's kind of
great we don't really mind Anna's
getting her like ingrown hand solution
laura mercier I think she's replaced her
cell cream foundation with like silky
moisturizing and silk cream oil free I
have one at home I haven't tried yet
Anna's just like gonna give it a go in
her hand or something
yeah but she's very very indecisive on
the shade yeah it's definitely shaking
dude shake Potter if I had any say
because I should I took I've tried about
my hand is good G just the moisturizing
one yeah not the oil free and I bought
some good easy my eyebrows think about
me we just saw
maybe man running after girl and then he
was like putting a white top and then
she was like oh she's gonna con Joe Bob
who's got it
don't steal clothes people it's pretty
bad the too early for our table and Marx
never been into Whole Foods so we're
showing him around for the first time
you excited about your first Whole Foods
experience we've already seen crosstown
donut doing some great pieces we're
heading up the escalators to the cheese
room which is my favorite part of Whole
Foods it's insane
whole room aircon full of cheese okay
we're heading to dirty Burnside we love
it early cookie Bella
did you enjoy Whole Foods
I really liked Ashley it's like didn't
look at the menu boy Wayne or anything
it's like burgers and hot dogs and
American stuff like that when they do
really good cocktails and I had you can
get hotdogs and you can pick if you want
pork beef or chicken sausage and maybe
really good fries what else we have
Rip's they were really good and really
good barbecue sauce but they have like
crazy burgers I have like mac and cheese
and everything in it do you like dinner
basically what I was trying to say is I
would really recommend it we had a
really nice time I'd like to get back
actually I'm gonna get more they'll
probably at the ribs next time because
the starter ribs are so so good so I bet
the main ones are even better I'm gonna
have my cup of tea now and then no it's
better probably see you on Sunday
because tomorrow is not much to vlog so
I'll see you then I made the stupid
mistake of washing my hair last night
and then just sleeping with it wet so I
had to spend my Sunday morning
straightening my hair which is not cool
but I first came here now which is great
I'll actually show you a show of what my
hair looked like this morning it's
obviously much curlier when I products
in it but this is what it's like when
I've slept in it wet I slept at it with
in a plat and absolutely no product on
it it is just a frizzy mess so I'll put
that little clip in now so today's
Sunday and I'm just loving a four day
weekend is so nice I just feel so like
not rushed do anything like yesterday me
and rich just had whole day together and
it was really nice and today well I need
to do some admin work this morning at
Rich's Kylie said he's gonna help me
this morning with my admin stuff so I'm
just gonna call him mr. receipt man
having a crumble for breakfast I know
that sounds weird but it's kind of
it's and free so I think it's fine
okay done all the boring admin stuff I
think that everyone else is gonna
probably but I've attempted and I've
just done my hair and now I'm gonna do
my makeup and so I ran my new braces
they're really really hard I'm gonna be
using this foundation which is new it's
from Laura Mercier her silk cream
foundation which I have ever here
actually this one has been repackaged to
look like this she's also brought out a
moisturizing version because the silk
cream foundation is very heavy it's a
bit like paint and this is a more
moisturizing version so it's got a
really nice kind of jewy shine to it and
I've used it once I used it yesterday
and I really liked it so I'm gonna try
it again today I'm really impressed so
far it's got like really good coverage
lasted all day but this one has a bit
more like shine gooeyness to it the salt
cream original was a bit heavy for me so
I'm gonna use this again and do the rest
of my makeup whilst watching YouTube
videos because that's what I always do
when I do my makeup okay so I've done my
makeup and I think I'm wearing more than
normal just because I had so much time
to get ready that I genuinely just enjoy
doing my makeup and when that happens I
always end up putting too much on but I
like looking nice at weekends and I've
got dressed I'm wearing black jeans and
a white shirt I just look a little bit I
don't know what is this jumper I'm not
sure if this goes at all it's like a
really loose knit jumper over a shirt
but I kind of gave up getting dressed I
find putting outfits together very not
enjoyable and I kind of want to look I
want to be comfy cuz it's Sunday but I
kind of would look nice because I'm not
sure what we're doing tonight so I think
this is happening right now but I can
always take this off and I was very sure
Anthony I think we're having a bit of
lunch at home to some like salami and
cheese and stuff and then we're gonna
head out and meet our friends which I'm
excited for my dad so impressed with his
lunch that he's taking a picture of it
the filming salami grapes bread and wine
you demolished all that food for lunch a
rich needs to get ready he's really
annoying makes he won't shower and I
want to go out and so close to phobic I
feel like I haven't done anything since
Friday
pleased our instinct yeah it's two
o'clock get ready
Oh what we're doing this afternoon okay
there's nothing open when you're
somebody don't let me celebrate Easter
Easter Sunday's been annoying because
the weekend I want to do fun stuff and
nothing is open which is annoying is the
funny thing I've ever seen these guys
eat greens to cover you coast and of
interesting stand back stand back okay
we're gonna walk along the canal to town

a little cinimon cameoed hotel then

getting coffees and lemon drizzle cake I
can't see levingers okay cannot get it
just want to talk about the fact that my
friend Jemma since I've ever known her
it's always carried around a huge bottle
of water with her so you know how people
are like you should drink water like
she's the best example of a sort of
person that actually does that no you
are the only tips on and your water just
have a strong arm so you can always
carry water with you but I'm amazed you
drink it it does make me drink it and if
I didn't I just wind about wanting water
we made it to Camden snow isn't winner

work our way through crazy busy Camden
