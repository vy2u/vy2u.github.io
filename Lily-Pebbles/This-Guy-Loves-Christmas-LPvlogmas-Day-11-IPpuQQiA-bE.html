caught up on me it's vlogmas day less
whenever i do vlogmas whatever you doubt
to use in a row there's always one day
where it's like the worst day of vlogmas
and I feel like today might be that day
I'm just feeling rough like just really
exhausted I'm gonna try and stay
positive today and not be too many but I
just want to let you know before a start
that today is gonna be one of those days
just for really tired I was meant to be
going to Tania and Jim's Christmas
parties tonight which is at their house
and I was so excited me in which were
going which got like a special Christmas
jumper for it but I'm just feeling
really like not 100% and I've got such a
busy weekend which is sisters coming to
stay with us that I you know you just
feel like if you push it too far you're
just gonna get real and it will ruin the
rest of the month so I text Tania's to
apologize and sad we can't be there but
I also don't want to make everyone else
l if I'm feeling like this then I don't
know I might be contagious whatever is
that I've got it might just be
exhaustion anyway had to cancel my plans
tonight I'm just gonna head over to my
mom's I'm gonna like hang with her
because I haven't seen her much recently
probably edit my videos over there and
then tonight I'm just gonna chill out at
home I might make myself since she can
sleep to make me feel better I got home
quite late last night so I couldn't show
you this but Sammy and Jason if you
watch Sammy's videos she's Beauty
question on YouTube they've got their
own brand called November night and
they're so sweet they kindly sent me
enriched some stuff they sent rich a top
which I know where it is I think it's a
wrong size for him Susan had to change
it but they also sent me a dress and a
makeup bag so I thought I'd show you you
can get all their stuff online this is
the makeup bag it's a really nice black
makeup bag it says November night silver
zip and it's got a really nice lining
inside as well and then they also sent
me one of those striped dresses I have
loved this this like sold out straight
away as soon as they got it and this is
like the second version so I can't wait
to wear that it's probably like quite
summery just but I reckon because the
material is quite thick you can
definitely wear it with tights as well
it's so cool I love it so thank you to
Sammy and Jason really really kind of
you okay I mean today is the 11th just
wrong this is the tuberous Angelica
never tried that one which is keeping
all of them in here
Clarence gave us some Christmas crackers
last night my mom is gonna be so happy
I'm gonna take these over to her now she
loves these do you know hello yeah I'm
filming her take a picture dude look at
the tree it's huge
is it this one's like three times as big
as my enrichers tree copper decorations
where are these from
they're very fancy track them Jeana
don't try and eat them then up boobs
we're going to leave my mum's Christmas
tree with just twinkle lights candy
canes and got purple boys faces playing
with the truck over there being noisy
then it's very important I just got to
my mom's house and it's like mother's
intuition she's making me chicken soup
she knows I don't feel great and it's
gonna make me feel so much better so
excited that the smell is already making
me feel better I'm gonna make myself
some avocado and toast looks I haven't
eaten anything yet today and I'm feeling
a little bit peckish
aces hair my arms if you're after him
this morning and we've been doing the
tree
Lena's been naughty sitting on the sofa
because she just she wants to sit nice
thing so much Aladdin she actually
watches TV weird dog this is my cousin
Jessica we're all sitting and watching
Aladdin on the Friday as you do I'm
gonna start editing my vlog so that it's
up in time for this evening whilst what
she loved in so I'm pretty happy right
now soup smells absolutely amazing so
I'm gonna make some little pastas throw
in I'm gonna have some chicken see if
it'll make me feel much better
my sisters are taking the kids to see
Santa Claus today I went there a couple
years ago I don't know if I've logged it
but it's like a train that goes around
it's but like it's a small world but
Christmas land and this sounds so fun
but I'm trying to mince myself not to go
because I think I need to just have a
day relaxing watching TV magic chicken
soup
I'm so happy to be eating this right now
I just picked three winners of the Bekaa
champagne pop highlighter competition
there Elana Bruce Danielle Anne and that
little shoe and I am do all on Twitter
so if you haven't yet got the message
go and check your DMS to find out how to
get your prize thanks everyone who
entered very exciting I hope you guys
enjoy the highlighter
I've just been chilling at my mom's all
afternoon watching TV doing ad Winnie
stuff sorting out Christmas presents and
I'm gonna head back it's my nub because
I need to make some dinner rich your
sisters coming to stay with us this
weekend and I think she's gonna arrive
tonight so that we can set off quite
early tomorrow morning to go into town
to go shopping because I think tomorrow
is gonna be like one of the busiest
Christmas shopping weekend's it's gonna
be crazy
so I think I'm gonna go get some food
make us everyone some dinner figure out
where she's gonna sleep because our flat
is tiny and sort out my life very
quickly popping into M&amp;amp;S on the way home
food shopping that this time of year is
followed because I get distracted by all
the Christmassy canapes and nibbles I
had to buy myself some mini mince pies
which sound like I've broken them and
well said I guess I got like some mmm
like ah I'm gonna put these in the oven
now just be a pig hot and spicy chicken
bites these are right with the
Christmassy canapes they're not actually
that Christmassy but I just couldn't
help myself I'm so young I swear I'm not
gonna eat all of these I'm gonna make
shepherd's pie tonight for rich and his
sister but I'm just gonna sit and chill
for a minute and watch own secret life
of 60 rows which I'm just so obsessed
with at the moment and relax I've just
tidied the whole flat ready for Jess to
come still need chill time so sorry this
vlog has been so boring but I wasn't
gonna put one up and I thought but it's
but one up is boring then nothing it's
okay I'm gonna make shepherd's pie which
we've already discovered is cottage pie
but I call it shepherd's pie it's with
mince beef I'm just gonna fry off some
onions carrots and celery in a pan and
then I'm gonna add the mince meat I feel
like she have a spike of quite good
things to make on people eating all
different times because it's really easy
to heat up britches getting back from
this Christmas party I don't know what
time jess is coming so it just something
that we don't have to like sit one time
and eat added in the mince
I'm gonna let that Brown off before
adding a little bit of beef stock in
there as well doesn't it very appetizing
but it tastes good
so that's all the kind of meat and veg
and stuff and then I just use
microwavable mashed potato because who
has time in their life to actually
mashed potatoes seriously and the M&amp;amp;S
sounds really good so I'm just gonna lay
that on top and then put it in the oven
rich just got home and he's been as
white Christmas party in his very
special Christmas jumper that he was
going to wear tonight but obviously
we're not going anymore but like how
great is that they've got a lot of love
today
you hear that music our neighbor
upstairs on a Friday night sometimes
they have like pre drinks before going
out and they play like darts music it's
quite nice music tonight it's so loud
our TVs having to be so allowed to like
fight with it Rich's sister's arrived
now and I've just washed my hair because
I need to make it look good for tomorrow
night I've told you yet we're going to
the Xbox Final Four exciting but having
like a VIP experience using your voice I
know
happy like that like two days I'm not
I'll I lose my voice when I talk too
much missing this is richer sister chair
is she pretty everyone's good sales so
pretty sure they're anything like this
ugly guy over here she's gonna be in the
vlog a lot over the next couple of days
cuz she's spending that weekend with us
I thought formally introduce you Jessica
sorry I never call you Jessica alright
now I need to tame this nutty mess on
top of my head this is literally what
comes out of the towel I think I'm gonna
use my knight seven seconds to tangler
because the stuff is great and my wet
brush this is the best combo of all time
smells so good okay look a bit of spray
a wet brush straight through it's so
good
if any of you guys for kids with tangly
hair because I used to cry every time I
mom brush my hair get them one of these
they come in travel sizes well you can
get long haul beauty and they do them in
like fun like pink
colors and stuff say little girls would
love them and it just goes right through
and that's so much better than the
tangle teezer easier to hold because it
has a handle genius so-called Jess but
with her oh my god I could eat that
whole thing to myself I love Milky Bar
did you even know that I just been
editing my vlog where's my headphone and
I've come to this clip now so I start
quickly end it even nice then he's like
straighten my hair and stuff that that's
really boring to watch tomorrow should
be more interesting we're going into
town and we're gonna go shopping and
then we're going to the X Factor find a
little should be really fun I'm excited
for that my highlight of the day god I
really didn't do anything interesting

highlight of the day rich do you have a
thought of the day good disappoint
