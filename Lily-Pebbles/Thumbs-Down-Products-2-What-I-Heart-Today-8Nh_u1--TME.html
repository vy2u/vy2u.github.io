disappointed products video it's always
a little bit sad I don't like to have
kind of negative things normally I just
don't really review something if I don't
like it but occasionally I'm pretty
disappointed when I think a products
gonna be really great and it's just not
so the first thing is the doctor charts
water max sleeping mask and as you guys
know I'm a big fan of dr. jart BB cream
so I was really excited for the sort of
skin care products and I got a few
products from the moist moist
most moist Ranger just kind of the
hydrating stuff and I was really excited
to try this in particular the sleeping
mask I did a review of this on my blog
so I'll link that below but basically
the reason I didn't like this is because
unlike my origins mask which I put on
and even the next morning I can still
kind of feel it sinking into my skin and
it's still some product to wipe away
this one sunk
straight into my skin straightaway so as
soon as I put it on it disappeared so I
didn't really understand the point of it
being an overnight mask I didn't feel
like it was doing much throughout the
night it was sort of just the first 10
minutes and it didn't even give me that
much kind of hydration I just didn't
feel like it was thick enough formula
and I don't know I think this would be
good for younger skin if you're like 16
17 and you want to try your first mask
or something this is probably quite good
but yeah I wasn't that impressed I
wasn't really that impressed at the
whole range
the next thing I'm so upset about
because I absolutely love this brand and
it's from a Jean I use the ocean on dry
recovery shampoo and conditioner and I
will be purchase to the rest of my life
it is my holy girl hair product and it's
incredible so excited to try this which
is that Eau de Jean full detox rub out
dry cleansing spray which is pretty much
dry shampoo product itself is good and I
tried so hard to ignore the smell but oh
my god the smell is so bad it smells to
me like a mix of celery and Cori and
that's you know on your head smell like
either of those things trust me it's
actually if you smell it in the bottle
is it serves more like alcohol but when
you put on your hair
the day the smell seems to kind of get
to get worse but again you know what I'm
like with smells I'm really picky so try
it yourself so I'm hoping that odor and
reformulate this with a new smell
because I love their products and I
think that dry shampoo is really good
but I just literally can't stand the
smell and I can't use it purely for that
reason so that's a shame the next thing
is for nails and it's the nails inc
corrector pen and stylo corrector and it
says oh that's just the French version
of corrector pen I'm an idiot on one end
it's kind of got this that's annoying
along sorry about that and then the
other end it has kind of refills in
there and it's basically just a little
pen with nail polish remover on so you
can go around the edge of your nails and
correct where you've kind of gone over
love the idea I always go over I'm not
very like neat painting my nails so love
the idea but I found that the pen bit
dries out so quickly like this one's
dead dry so I was like I'll take that
out and put refill in the refills were
all dry so I pretty much didn't get to
use this I used it like once and then
the whole thing dried out I think
there's a massive flaw in the sort of
design of the product the next product
is one that I really really wanted to
try and it's the Lucas pour pour
appointment and it's kind of a cult
product in Australia I think and it's
made out of fermented fruit which is
very good to kind of dry patches you can
use this as like a multi-purpose balm
you can use it on your lips and your
elbows on your hands like any dry
patches you have and I love the idea of
it and the product itself isn't that bad
but again I'm weird the smell oh it
actually smells like like fermented
fruit which is just like rotten fruit
and I feel like when you put on your
lips especially which is what I wanted
to use this for mainly it kind of gets
hot and like you just feel like you've
got hot rotten fruit on your lips
this isn't my going straight in the bin
or the straight into the friends pile I
would use occasionally but I'm just
disappointed with it because it wasn't
as good as I wanted it to be the next
product you have heard me talk a lot
about and this this one really angers me
and it's the main
Valene superstay 14 our lipstick in
non-stop red color is really really
pretty it looks like this it's kind of a
bright bright orange red but the minute
I use this I'd say half an hour after
using it my lips became so dry and I'm
not allergic to anything literally
nothing I haven't got sensitive skin and
knowledge - anyhow foods I came up with
such a bad reaction to this but since
then this was before Christmas I think
since then my lips have never been the
same they were so dry and it she just
got a throne for my dogs and now because
he's gonna prescribe me some stuff for
my lips there's a little purpose of this
stupid lipstick so I don't know what's
in it definitely the formula because
I've tried it different Maybelline
lipstick since which was scary but I
took the risk and that was fine this
started it all and since then like my
lips all right when I went to holiday
but as soon as I come to came back to
the UK and it's cold that they've just
gone really dry again so the stupid
lipstick ruined my lips so be careful
try it on your wrist first the next
product is from Liz Earle and I really
used to love them is our cleanse and
polish I don't use it anymore just
because I feel like it's quite basic
cleanser it's good for that younger skin
you know 25 now I think I need to be
using stuff with a bit more like active
ingredients in but I really do like the
cleanser polish and a while ago I wanted
to try something else from the range so
I tried the skin repair moisturizer
which says for normal combination skin
this was a gentle mister Iser it felt
quite nice on the skin it kind of smells
like nappy cream I just feel like they
didn't read do anything for my skin it's
a very very basic moisturizing what did
you use the whole thing up but I got
there's a little bit left I've got the
end and I just really wants to move on
something else because I wasn't enjoying
using it felt like I was paid enough
people on my face and wasn't really
doing anything for my skin it wasn't
hydrating enough for my sort of
dehydrated skin so I was a bit
disappointed with that really the next
thing you guys will know about because I
had in a recent video of my mind it
might I'll add haul and there the baby
lips now after all your comments thank
you for comments another video I
realized that they have to
Baby Lips in sort of Asia and Australia
and loads of people comments it loads of
Australians commented on that video I
unloaded people from Asia as well saying
these are the baby looks they get but
they are definitely different for the
ones you get in America which are bigger
and have more of like a lipstick
packaging and I think they must be
different because people in America rave
about them and these were so
disappointing I bought for one of them I
haven't even opened because I just know
I'm not going to use it they're just
like chap sticks like here I'll show you
they have like a little lid and they
warned up and it's just a little lip
balm and I would never buy chapstick
because I don't think they're very great
and yeah these are just colored chap
sticks this one's not even colored it's
plain so I really don't see the point in
that one and really disappointed rubbish
products so I feel sorry for everyone in
Australia Asia we didn't get them at all
actually so I don't feel sorry for you
but hopefully when we do get them we'll
get the same ones America has hopefully
so the next two things of both
foundations I try a lots of foundations
and I've pretty much know straight away
when I try it whether I like it or not
because I know what I look for a
foundation I like moisturizing light to
medium coverage dewy glowing skin I
don't like so you have to see it around
my nose you know everyone has that sort
of a list that they take off when they
try a new product so the first one I was
disappointed in is the Giorgio Armani
maestro fusion makeup and this was quite
a big launch and I know a lot of blogs
were talking about it and I think they
haven't concealer they for salad
everyone says is much better than the
foundation so I definitely want to try
that but this is kind of a weird product
it comes with like a pipette and it's
very like medicinal looking but it's not
really meant to be a foundation it's
kind of meant to be like a primary type
sheeny product I'm not really sure how
to explain it how some I fancy science
in it I think I did a blog post Ashley
on this so I'll link that below yeah I
didn't really like this it's very very
thin and watery which is it's meant to
be but it just didn't work for me didn't
look good on my skin I felt I had needed
foundation on top which is kind of silly
so I don't use this and yeah it just
didn't really work for me but I know a
lot about the people liked it I think
because of the fancy packaging and it
I was quite excited to use it and a
little bit disappointed the next one is
from Calvin Klein and it's for their CK
one like new makeup range and this is
the three-in-one face makeup and yeah I
just didn't like this like many
foundations it was too cakey for me and
although it's not like a very very heavy
foundation it is quite kind of glowy
they just cling to all my dry patches
around my nose and it just didn't sit
well you know some foundations just
don't sit well on me so that was one of
them I was disappointed with that only
three more products to go to mascaras
the first one is the majolica majorca
mascara lash King I mentioned in my
Thailand haul and I was really excited
to try this apparently majolica majorca
is posh to Sado it's like their High
Street brand I just feel like it did
absolutely nothing for my lashes again I
knew straight away I know with mascara
is what I like and it was a real
struggle to get my lashes to do anything
they weren't really curling they weren't
getting much volume or length and it was
just a real hassle to get my lashes to
do anything and normally my lashes are
really easy there already quite curly I
just need something with a bit of length
and yeah I'm not going to use it again I
think it was pretty rubbish the next one
I think might surprise you and it's
benefit they're real mascara I've seen
so many bloggers like raining about this
and say this is a favorite mascara ever
which is probably why I had quite high
hopes for it I think it's benefit told
us that it's the number one best-selling
mascara in the UK which is unreal that's
an incredible title to have so I was
really excited to try it although it
does have a plasticy brush which I'm not
a fan of so I was already a bit like
this might not be for me and yeah was
not blown Oy but I am not sure why I
just didn't give enough volume I think
it kind of separated the lashes quite
nicely but I don't know I do think it's
a good mascara but I think I was
expecting it to be the best mascara in
the UK which I don't think it is I love
my Clinique one as you know so as you
know I don't know how they come up with
those poles because everyone's pretty
different but well done on benefit or
getting the best mascara the UK but
unfortunately it didn't work that well
for me final product is another one I
was really excited to try and it's from
Anastacia which is a brand I wanted to
try for ages I don't really do much to
my brows and they're known for their
brows they do have a few products that I
really wanted to try and one of them was
the clear brow gel I got this um cult
beauty and in terms of like holes it's
the best player barrage I've ever tried
my eyebrows do not move at all when I
use this but and like someone one of you
guys commented on my videos and even
noticed from this far away it leaves
when it dries these white bits in my
eyebrows which i think is just
unacceptable for a brand that
specializes in eyebrows phonetically a
brow gel not to dry clear it's dry with
white bits it's just ridiculous so I
don't know it's a shame because it's a
really good Brad gel it's the best one
I've tried in terms of my eyebrows not
moving but I can't quite a bit to my
eyebrows that's crazy so very
disappointed with that and very annoyed
about that too and so that's everything
thanks for putting up with my annoying
cold voice I'm actually feeling much
better now I was really getting ill when
I was in Paris so I felt now looking
back I realized how rough I felt when I
was there so I'm glad that that vlog
went down well thanks for your comments
on that by the way say yep sorry about
the voice but I hope you like seeing
kind of the products I was disappointed
in and why I was disappointed in them
and hopefully this will help you a bit
if you're thinking of buying any of
those things let me know what product
you have been disappointed in recently
because I like to hear what other people
have been disappointed in as well it
kind of helps me so comment below and
let me know and thank you for watching
I'll see you in my next video
