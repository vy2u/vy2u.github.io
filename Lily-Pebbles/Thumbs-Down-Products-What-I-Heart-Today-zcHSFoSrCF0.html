two-part video which are products that I
was disappointed in and products that I
wasn't disappointed in and I'm gonna
call it thumbs up products and thumbs
down products and it's not necessarily
things I regret buying because I don't
really regret buying them it's just
things that I was and it's also not
products that were hyped up it's just
things I was looking forward to trying
and that I was either really
disappointed with when I tried it or
really happy with when I tried it and um
also a little disclaimer I'm not saying
that the products are bad because some
of them are like Colts products and some
of them other youtubers love or my some
of my best friends love and I don't so
it's obviously just a personal taste and
it shows that everybody's different
so I think this video I'm gonna do the
products that I was disappointed with
and then the next one won't be the
products that I was happy with so okay
I'm gonna start with the products that I
was a little disappointed with when I
got home and tried them so the first one
is gonna be the Clarins Beauty flash
bomb and I'm well aware that this is a
proper cult product and one our best
friends Deb's loves this and wears it
everyday
but with me I just really didn't like it
so I bought this in the airport because
it's discounted and I've always wanted
to try it just because I think every
magazine I've ever read has talked about
this and it's just everywhere so I was
at the airport and it's supposed to be
like a moisturizer primer it says it
brightens and tightens and Karen's is a
really good brand so I was looking
forward to it the reason I don't like
this number one smell I think it smells
like nappy cream I don't know for those
of you who haven't been around nappy
cream maybe you won't understand but to
me this smells like my nieces and
nephews nappy cream it's really really
strong so when I put it on my face I
really like smell it all the time on me
and I hate that when there's a really
heavy scent on a put-on so you're going
to pull all over your face and it is
quite nice I mean it was quite thick you
didn't didn't feel horrible on my face
but once
I've gotten over the smell of it which
took quite a while it feel like I really
did much for me it didn't really act as
a primer it didn't waste ur eyes that
well I just felt a bit like it just
wasn't worth the hype the tool and just
did nothing and you can see if I have
fill it is I haven't used it at all I
used a few times and just decided I
couldn't handle the smell and I'll
probably give this to someone so that
was a shame and the next one all down
here it's kind of a similar product is
the Elizabeth Arden 8 hour cream which
again is a proper cult product that
everybody loves um I've had this for
years I used to carry it in my handbag
all the time and I used to pretend I
loved it
but then I just realized I'm lying to
myself I don't love it um it's a thick
bomb that you can use on dry chapped
areas you can use it on your lips and
your elbows any sorts of areas that are
dry and it helps the Sun burns it helps
with everything it's just one of those
that's been around for Edwards is really
good product but I didn't like it
because I don't like to smell again I
think I have a real problem with smells
really don't like the smell of God I've
really don't like it so that's worse
than the Clarins flash bomb really darn
smell they've actually recently bought
at an unscented is that the word
fragrance free version so I ran straight
away to boots to try it and it smells
exactly the same like maybe not strong
but you can definitely smell it it's
definitely not fragrance free I also
didn't love this because it's so so
thick like I wouldn't use it as a lip
balm because if I accidentally lick my
lips I'm gonna have that disgusting
smell in my mouth and it's kind of too
thick to use on my elbows but just
couldn't really find a use for it and I
thought like I was carrying it around on
my hand like all the time and never
using it so just don't really think this
is for me it's a shame really um I think
the lip balm is quite nice they have
like a lip balm version that's in the
lipstick my sister uses that I think
that's quite nice but the this original
version even though it's not a nice tube
I just never use it the next product is
the mac fix+
and I bought the travel version when I
was
up and I thought I'd give it a go
because I've always wanted to try it and
this is supposed to be sort of
refreshing spray it's good if you put
too much makeup on and you want to like
sort of make it bit want Juhi it can be
used as a setting spray although I don't
think that's really what it's that good
for and I just didn't get this a tool it
feels like water to me it doesn't
Stephanie not mist it's like a spring
okay well that was annoying my memory
card ran out of space so I had to
download the first part of that video
where I was I think I was about the mac
fix+ a Caron but I said last but this is
I think I'll sign about the spray and
when you spray this it's not a mist like
the quarterly beauty elixir it's an
actual spray so first I use this was
after I did my makeup and it pretty much
ruined my makeup and I looked like I had
a wet face and it really annoyed me so
um Dodi's how I would use this as before
I put my makeup on but then it's kind of
just like washing your face I mean it
says it has minerals and stuff in it I
don't know I'm just not a fan I don't
really see the point of it and I think
it's just nicely packaged water the next
thing is another kind of shocker if I
really mean this is quite like a
depressing video sorry there's lots of
other products from these brands that I
like but these ones just didn't float my
boat so this is chanel nail polish and I
hunted down this nail polish for months
and months it could particularly err
particular particularly yeah I don't
know how to say that but it's 5:05
particularly yeah I think that's how you
say it
it's kind of a brown brownie taupe kind
of a mushroom you brown color um and
yeah I look to this for age just because
I really really wanted it it's the first
to know it nail polish I bought and I
haven't bought any since and it's in
this nice packaging with a nice lid and
the Chanel logo and another little lid
under there the reason I was
disappointed with this is because it
lasted around one day if that before
chipping and no matter what base coat or
what topcoat I used my nails were in
great condition at the time
it always chipped and I just think
that's a bit unacceptable for how
expensive it was and it's Chanel so
that's a shame it's a really nice color
I think bury em do one quite similar and
yeah I just can't believe it lasted such
a short time I think it's a real shame
bastarz disappointed with that and
another nail polish actually is the
Sally Hansen complete salon manicure and
this is in the color yellow Kitty and
this is the first nail polish from Sally
Hansen I fought I bought like top quo
and basically this is the first color
nail polish and I bought it because I
thought would be really nice sort of
yellowy banana a yellow color for the
summer and it wasn't so much the nail
polish that I was disappointed with
because I think the nail polish was all
right and it's got a really nice like
big thick brush like the new Essie
polishes but it was the color it just
wasn't her nice banana yellow it was a
kind of sick yellow so I think that's
shame and I was kind of really
disappointed with the color and I won't
use that because it just doesn't see my
skin tone at all the next thing I'm
going to do these two because they're
both mascaras so the first one this just
shows its complete personal taste
because this is a favorite of Anna for
Viviana those makeup and she has lovely
lashes and she always looks great so
obviously just works different for
different people but I got this it's the
L'Oreal telescopic mascara I got this
before I went to Morocco because it's
waterproof and I thought that'd be good
for holiday but I just it's just really
not my sort of mascara it's got a
plastic wand and I like quite thick like
furry ones so they give my lashes a lot
of thickness and this is just to fill it
fiddly I found like I couldn't even grit
my eyelashes with it because it was just
so small and it just did nothing my
lashes literally there's nothing it kind
of separated them a bit that was it and
I felt like I was wearing no mascara
when I wore it and another mascara is
the covergirl LashBlast fusion which I
got in America in Target when I was
there it's quite a cool packaging like
kind of purple
and this is kind of a massive massive
fat brush but tiny tiny tiny plastic
bristled things on it and similar to the
telescope at one I feel like I couldn't
grip my lashes very well I just thought
I was brushing them and not really like
getting through them properly I can't
explain it just did nothing you think
from the brush that it give you really
thick full lashes but it just did
absolutely nothing for them and I was
really disappointed with that and I need
to throw this away sorry really old but
I don't use it I just sort of kept it in
my jaw the next product is another thing
that people always love so I don't know
what's wrong with me I didn't seem to
love any of these things but it's a
sleek face contour kit I'm sleek is a
really good brand and they have really
affordable makeup that they sell in soup
drug and I'd like something else stuff
I've tried but this is basically the
idea is great it's a bronze and
highlight duo so perfect all you need
bronzer color to contour with and a sort
of shimmery highlights for your
cheekbones and stuff and it looks really
nice like when it's in here but the
colors just don't work for me at all the
bronze is just to sort of murky dirty
color for me it just literally makes me
look dirty when I put it on and doesn't
see me so I find it really hard to blend
as well and the highlight color is too
white I just feel like when I wear these
together I literally look like something
out of tau e and it just looks all for
on my skintone and on everything and I
can't get it to work at all so I'm
probably gonna give this to my cousin
because I think she'll like it
um but yeah it's just not for me but I
think it's a good price and yeah a good
deal if the colors work for you I think
this is good product then I've got a
brush another brush that everybody loves
and it's the Sigma flat top synthetic
kabuki f80
and it looks like this it looks similar
to the Real Techniques buffing brush but
it's actually quite different it's a lot
more kind of dense a lot more hairs pack
together a slightly different shape as
well when I first got this I was really
excited and I used it for quite a while
but then I just realized it was
too much for me I don't need to wear
that much makeup and I was making my
foundation really cakey and too heavy
it's definitely like I show you than
this too like a flat foundation brush
but I'm just trying it on my hand now I
just don't it's not as good as the
buffing brush and I was a bit
disappointed with it I just haven't used
it much really since I got it then
another nail product is something I use
a lot which is kind of strange or
something that I'm not a big fan of but
that's just for convenience really and
it's the OPI nail Envy I actually have
two of these so I'm not gonna throw them
away I'm definitely gonna keep using
them because they don't damage my nails
or anything and I use it as a base coat
the reason I'm disappointed with it
because it just doesn't really
strengthen my nails I bought it because
my nails were really flaky when I got
back from holiday and I thought this
would really strengthen them and get rid
of the flakiness but I just haven't seen
a massive change in my nails really I
don't know if I did it wrong my felt I
think I followed all the instructions
but just didn't seem to do much
I wasn't like wow my nails in such a
good condition now they're still kind of
a bit flaky and rubbish so I don't think
this really does what it says it should
do and I just got a few more the next
one is the benefit Porefessional primer
and I can see why a lot of people like
this I think it is a good product but
it's just not the sort of primer I like
and it felt it's funny because it's
funny because a prime is meant to like
stop grease and it's oil-free it says
and you know it's not meant to feel
greasy but I feel like it feels greasy
on me and really like slippery and I
just don't really like this sort of
primer I prefer the water-based primers
and this is to kind of a gentle just
feels weird and I was it didn't feel
like it made my makeup last at all and I
felt like my makeup disappeared quicker
than it normally does with my Laura
Mercier primer so as a shame because it
was quite expensive and I doubt I really
don't love it but I keep it and try it
again every now and again like who knows
maybe if my skin changes it'll work
better for me because I know a lot of
people that love this the next to the
final two are lip products first one is
limited edition Vaseline
creme brulee I don't know why I bought
this I know I don't like wrestling I
really don't like rustling I feel like
it doesn't monster eyes my lips at all
it just sits on the top of my lips and
it's full of stuff that isn't good for
you like petroleum jelly it's not good
to be on lip balm but I completely fell
for the hype and there was a big stool
big stand in Selfridges like creme
brulee Vaseline and I love creme brulee
so I just bought this thinking yeah it's
not like creme brulee but doesn't smell
like creme brulee so I was like Vaseline
with just smells like sweet rustling it
could be strawberry it could be anything
definitely isn't like creme brulee and
it's still plain old Vaseline it's
actually the same Vaseline just with a
slightly different smell so I don't know
why I got that I never ever use it and
then the last one is a Topshop lipstick
and this is really cool like when I saw
it I was really excited it's in Crystal
and it's like a bright pink clear lip
stick with like crystals and Sparky bits
in the side and I still think it's
really cool to like take out and open it
looks really impressive and it supposed
to be one of those ones like especially
one of those lip balms that adapts the
pH of your lips and so it looks a
different color and everyone let me just
try it on my hand I feel like it's quite
watery that's not really moisturizing
and it does sort of go pink but I don't
know I don't know why I was expecting
from it but my expectations are probably
just too high but I just feel like it's
a bit of a pinky watery lip balm and it
wasn't as exciting as the when I looked
at it I was like it's amazing but it
wasn't that amazing really so that's it
for products that I was disappointed in
I felt a little bit like depressed now
so I'm gonna film the video with these
products here about the products that I
love and then that will be up next so
don't forget to watch that that will
make you a bit happier and again like I
said at the beginning it doesn't mean
those products are bad it's just that
they didn't really work for me
so let me know actually if you have any
of those products and love them and if
I'm using any of them wrong as well
because I'll definitely try them again
if I am so thanks for watching and I'll
see you in part two bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
