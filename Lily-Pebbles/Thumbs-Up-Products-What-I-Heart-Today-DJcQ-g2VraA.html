you would have seen before this one this
is the thumbs up products so products
that I was really happy with and I was
looking forward to buying it and then
when I came home and tried it it was
exactly how I want it to be if not
better so this is a very positive video
I'm liking it so far first product is
the YSL lift 8 to shake lot bad French
sorry Foundation and there was a massive
hype around this for ages it's the
foundations go alongside the tissue
Clarke famous white sock concealer and
it was a big deal there's like 25 shades
pinky shades neutral shades yellowy
shades
it's just they properly properly went
into this I think they've been making it
for years and years um I actually really
don't like Letitia Clarke and concealer
so I was really surprised how much I
liked this foundation it's in a really
nice glass bottle and the color
excuse me perfectly I've got be 40 I
tried B 30 as well but and they both
kind of will suit me but different times
of the year it's a really nice sort of
gel based foundation so it goes on
really nicely I use my hands to apply it
and then a brush to blend it out it just
looks like a second skin it feels nice
on and I really really love it and it's
not as expensive as you would think it
would be for why sell it's still
high-end but it's completely worth it
and I think if you struggle to find the
right color foundation
I just think even if you don't I just
think everyone should go and get a
sample of this they're really good at
giving out samples on the counter and I
really love it it's definitely one of my
top 5 foundations and I was even happier
with it that I thought it would be when
I got it
so that's good and the next thing is the
chordally beauty elixir a lot of people
don't love this I really do I've got
quite a few small ones I keep my handbag
and I've got big ones that I keep on my
Beauty desk
that's not what it's good it's a good
dressing table I keep a couple of my
dressing table and I do forget to use it
sometimes I like to use it in the
morning before I put my makeup
and throughout the day to sort of
refresh my face and my makeup I think
it's got the perfect spray he'd like it
to mist it doesn't just like spray water
in your face like the Mac fix plus it's
a nice mist I really like the smell I
know Zoe from zoella hates the smell I
can understand why sometimes I think it
depends when I read sometimes I don't
really like it most the time I do it's
kind of her believe very like
aromatherapy smelling like a bath and I
like it and peroneus Victoria Beckham's
favorite product and I like the glass
bottle I just like everything about it
and I don't need to buy anymore
I have like three backups I think I
don't know why I ended up with so many I
think I'm looking up there because
they're all sitting there I think I went
a bit crazy one day and just every time
I saw what I bought it so now I've got
loads I don't need to buy any more but I
really like that and you should go try
it because I think they love the smell
or you hate it
the next thing then it's put us that
were really worth the hype are the Real
Techniques brushes makeup brushes and
these had a massive fiber on them
because they're made by Samantha Chapman
who is one half of Pixie woo on YouTube
and so she's a famous youtuber makeup
artist and she made these brushes so
first of all is all the bloggers and
youtubers that went crazy for them and
then it's sort of one out of general
public as well and I think they're
really really good I would go far as far
as saying they're my favorite brushes
there's not a massive selection so
obviously I still use Mac and other
brushes as well but if this had like a
2-1 7 max u17 in it then I've just
usually use these my favourites are the
big powder brush which is just so so
soft they're all synthetic really soft
the blush brush which I actually use the
bronzer to contour with and the buffing
brush Foundation and a stippling brush
for foundation and tinted moisturizer
and this lil one it was just a contour
brush is good for highlighter as well so
I really like them I just think they do
the job they clean really easily and
they look nice makeup like long you can
stand them up which that's a bad example
this one you can right stand up and
you're just
or you can put them in a little cup like
this like I do
candle cup um yes they clean well they
apply makeup really well they're
synthetic they're soft they're just
really really good and they sell them in
Boots so go and get them
the next product which also had a
massive hype around it it's kind of an
obvious one and it's the Urban Decay
Naked palette and this is the first one
I haven't got the second one because I
just don't think I need any more
eyeshadows so this is what it looks like
it's got a selection mainly of like
neutral shades quite shimmery and then a
few dark ones and up here I actually
don't use these two on the end which are
quite blue but all the others I really
like and I especially like half-baked
which is really gold and naked which is
like a matte everybody got off your
crease and but actually sidecars smog
can kind of just reading through all the
colors now I think I like them all but
they're really good is I think this may
have been like the first product from
Urban Decay ever bought I ended up
having to buy it in Sephora in South of
France because it was sold out here
everywhere and I saw it there water
straight away I think my sister bought
it as well for her wedding it's just got
all the colors you really need and it's
easy to take away in this sort of casing
and it does give it grubby because it's
like felt material but they're just
really really good quality and this girl
opened my eyes to the quality of Urban
Decay's eyeshadows as well so I think
this is worth getting it's still out so
go and look at the this one and the
naked to sort of see which one's more
your colors because I think naked tears
more cool tone colors and this one's a
bit more warm which is good for me next
up is the MU a professional eye primer
and this isn't a hyped up product but
this is just something that I thought
I'm going to give it a try and I'm kind
of looking forward to see how it
compares to other primers because it was
I think I got pound or something Mei
products are so cheap they're solid
superdrug and it's kind of similar to
the Urban Decay potion primer
I think it's called decideded potion and
it's kind of in one of these applicators
and it comes out the same sort of kind
of creamy color and
this is amazing I think it's better than
that Urban Decay one it's so so much
cheaper it makes what I makeup last all
day and I literally don't think I need
to try any other eye primer it's perfect
it does the job and I think if you do
wear eye primers you should try this
because if it does work for you then
you're saving yourself a lot of money
and I'm really impressed I think mu is a
really good brand actually so that's the
eye primer and I recommend you try that
oh my god I've actually got so many
products here let me just space them out
a bit getting a bit confused
okay the next ones are lip products and
these are the Revlon lip butters which
I've got here and these two quite a
while to come to the UK they came out in
America first which is where I got them
because I happened to be on holiday in
Miami when they first came out so I went
a bit crazy you can ask my boyfriend and
my sister and brother-in-law who I
literally dragged to every drugstore in
Miami and New York just so I could find
every color I think I actually bought
every color I know what's wrong with me
I think I was like high on holiday mode
I don't need every color by I bought
loads I've got more in my drawer these
are just my favorite ones so the ones
I've got here a berry smoothie sweet
tart cherry tart and cotton candy and
you mean to pick that up that's not one
of my favorites I think it's just ds3
cherry tart it's like a proper proper
red and needs to a kind of more pinky
and I think they're really good they're
the colors really strong and they feel
like a lip balm they're really
moisturizing they're in this cute
packaging you wind off but like the Dior
lipsticks and I think they're really
good they do what they say they do and
they're not too expensive and I think if
you want to wear lipstick but you're a
bit intimidated by I find it quite hard
then these are perfect because they're
like a lip balm but with good color not
like the rubbish colored lip balms that
hardly show these are like proper color
they're pretty much lipsticks so I'm
really impressed with those I think they
did very well
all done Revlon I think those are really
good another lip products it's also at
the drugstore
I bought all of these out of my drawer
for some reason
to make easier to hold and these are the
Kate Moss lipsticks I don't remember
what made me first try these I think it
may have been Jen from beauty junkie
London who just mentioned that she liked
the Kate Moss lipstick so that they were
really good quality so I went to try one
and literally the first one I tried I
was so impressed which I was the first
one I don't remember which one it was
but they're just so so good there either
I've said before they're my favorite
drugstore lipsticks by far they're so
creamy and easy to apply they never dry
off get my lips I never look flaky
really nice colors nice packaging I just
think they're really good I think
they're better than a lot of MAC
lipsticks though and I was really
surprised I was looking forward to
trying it but it beat my expectations
and just I'm really impressed I think
they're really good lipsticks and you
should try them if you like drugstore
lipsticks or even if you don't actually
because these are better than most you
should go and try the Kate Moss
lipsticks and from Rimmel did I even say
their Rimmel their mo and they're really
nice um the next couple of things and
blushes I've got two of the Tarte
Amazonian clay blushes that I got in
Sephora in America when I was there and
this one's exposed and this one is tipsy
and these are really nice they fold open
flat which I really like in a blusher
they're gone they've got a really strong
color really nice color reigns over lots
of other ones as well I wanted to get
that I probably will get sued I just
really like them I was really excited to
try like a new brand when I got these
and I can't remember who said they were
really good but I was really excited to
buy them and they I was really impressed
I really liked them so if you are near
anywhere that sells these Sephora or if
you want to get these online I would
recommend it so yeah anyway I'm rambling
now but these are really good and I can
remember how much they were I don't they
weren't cheap they weren't crazy
expensive but I'm glad I got them and
I'll definitely want to try more well
though I did not ever finish these you
need the tiniest tiniest amount but
they're really good another blusher is
the benefit coralista everyone always
talks about this and everyone always
talks about how expensive benefit
blushes and bronzers are in general
because I think they're like 25 pounds
or something and I think benefits quite
a confusing brand because of the imagery
they use in the advertising and
marketing so sort of bubbly and young
and cute and colorful that you kind of
expect it to be a bit cheaper it's not
like you know Chanel packaging that's
all smart and black and so you know it's
expensive so I think people are always a
bit shocked when they get to the till
and they get told that this is like 25
pounds because definitely like a bit
more high-end and expensive so it's a
little bit confusing but I have a few
blushes from there and I do like them
all but the corrilesa is amazing and I
got this ages ago but I use it all the
time I'd definitely repurchase it if I
run out I actually don't know where the
bottom is I don't know where I'm gonna
run out but I love it's in the old
packaging which I love because then I
can use put the brush in here and then
put it in here
I'm not even talking since you know I
mean like brush it in there so I don't
have too much on the brush it smells
amazing it literally smells amazing do
you even know what it's supposed to
smell like um and even if I don't know
if it's supposed to smell of anything or
if it's just the natural smell of it I
don't know I'm gonna find out afterwards
that's gonna annoy me but yeah I love
the packaging the products amazing it's
perfect color and I'm really glad I got
this it's definite thumbs up from me and
and then I've just got two more things
um one of them is the nooks lip balm
which headquar bloggers hype around it
it's the Rev de miel lip balm and this
was like 10 pounds which is crazy for a
lip balm it's in a nice like frosted
glass jar and I really like this it's
really different to a normal lip balm
it's oh my god I've just broken the lid
I'm literally broke in the lid I can't
get it open
one sec okay I don't know what I did
there but anyway um it's kind of like a
mat you can see it's a yellow color and
it's kind of a matte lip balm it's not
like really slippery or shiny matte it
has it feels a little bit exfoliating as
well so it's not like great to put under
lip products like lipsticks I don't
think but it's nice to use on its own
especially overnight because it's really
moisturizing and you should scoop out
loads I think at first I was trying to
like my finger like that and wasn't
getting much use a scoop up quite a bit
and put it on I think it's really good
I'm happy I got that and I think it was
worth the hype that little hype that I
had around it and then the final product
which is my favorite is the bourgeois
one second magic nail polish remover and
this is basically a pot filled with like
black foam and there's a little hole in
the middle and inside it's like soaked
with nail polish remover and you may
think like what's the point why don't
you just remove your nail polish but why
I find it quite annoying having to I
always do my nails downstairs in the
lounge by noise has to take cotton ball
and they'll push and move and all these
separate things it's quite nice to have
it all in one second of all it's really
quick you put your finger in it's not
quite one second
I think that's bending the trade
slightly but put your finger in and like
swirl it around like that if you like
push it against the sides as well it
really helps and and then it all comes
off and it's got like nice oils and
stuff in it as well so whereas normal
now question move it makes my nails feel
there but weak this makes it feel really
moisturizing and when I take my nails
out and they're quite oily I just swap
in the oils to my cuticles and I think
it's really nice and it's not great for
glitter nail polishes but it does work
I've discovered that if you just leave a
finger in there and it sounds really
weird but if you like pump the bottom
then you get quite a lot of the liquid
and the nail polish remover so if you do
that and sort of leave a finger it's
soaked for a bit then it does I should
take Lister off but be warned that the
glitter will stay in there so you'll
probably get glitter if you put your
finger in it again in the future I think
it's really good so lasted me ages I
haven't run out yet I don't really know
when you've run out I guess when it's
dry but I'll get another one straight
away it was cheap and it's so easy take
it on holiday to work
I love it I just think it's amazing I
know they used to do these like back in
the day of burps I dunno I forgot about
them and no other brands bought them
back so now it's back again I'm I love
it and I hope it doesn't go again so I
think that's everything my floor is like
covered in products so I think that's
everything for this video
and so those the products I was really
happy with and I hoped you liked this
little two-part video thing let me know
what you thought and if any of those
products that I just mentioned in this
video whether you use them as well so
thank you for watching and I'll see you
soon
thanks bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
