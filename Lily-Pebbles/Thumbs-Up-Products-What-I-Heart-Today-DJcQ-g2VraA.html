that you would have seen before this one
and this is the thumbs up products so
products that I was really happy with
and I was looking forward to buying it
and then when I came home and tried it
it was exactly how I wanted it to be if
not better so this is a very positive
video I'm liking it so far first product
is the YSL lit aid to shake lot bad
French sorry foundation and there was a
massive hyper around this for ages it's
the foundations go alongside the tissue
Clark famous white cell concealer and it
was a big deal there's like twenty five
shades pinky shades neutral shades
yellowy shades it's just they properly
properly went into this I think they've
been making it for years and years and I
actually really don't like the two
o'clock and concealer so um I was really
surprised how much I like this
foundation it's in a really nice glass
bottle and the color seasoned perfectly
I've got be 40 i tried be 30 as well but
and they both kind of will suit me but
different times of the year it's a
really nice sort of gel based foundation
so it goes on really nice yay use my
hands to apply it and then a brush to
blend it out it just looks like a second
skin it feels nice on and i really
really love it and it's not as expensive
as you would think it would be 4y cell
and it's still high end but it's
completely worth it and i think if you
struggle to find the right color
foundation I just think even if you
don't I just think everyone should go
and get a sample of this they're really
good at giving out samples on the
counter and I really love it it's
definitely one of my top five
foundations and I was even happier with
it that I thought it would be when I got
it so that's a good'n and the next thing
is the cordially beauty elixir a lot of
people don't love this and I really do
I've got quite a few small ones i keep
my handbag and I've got big ones that i
keep on my beauty desk that's not what
it's good it's a cord dressing table i
keep a couple of my dressing table and I
do forget to use it sometimes i like to
use it in the morning for i put my
makeup
on and throughout the day to sort of
refresh my face and my makeup I think
it's got the perfect spray like it to
missed it doesn't just like spray water
in our face like the mac fix+ it's a
nice missed I really like the smell I
know Zoe from zoella hates the smell I
can understand why sometimes I think
depends on my mood sometimes I don't
really like it most the time I do it's
kind of her believe very like a Roma
therapy smelling like a bath and I like
it and peroneus victoria beckham's
favorite product and i like the glass
bottle I just like everything about it
and I don't need to buy any more I have
like three backups I think I don't know
why I ended up with so many I think I'm
looking up there because they're all
sitting there I think I went a bit crazy
one day and every time I saw what I
bought it so now I've got loads I don't
need to buy any more but I really like
that and you should go try it because I
think they loved smell you hate it um
the next thing then X products that were
really worth the hype are the Real
Techniques brushes makeup brushes and
these had a massive hype around them
because they're made by Samantha Chapman
who is one-half of Pixiwoo on YouTube
and so she's a famous youtuber makeup
artist and she made these brushes so
first of all is all the bloggers and
youtubers that went crazy for them and
then it's sort of one out of general
public as well and I think they're
really really good I would go far as far
as saying they're my favorite brushes
there's not a massive selection so
obviously i still use mac and other
brushes as well but um if this had like
a 217 mac 217 in it then I've just
usually use these my favorites are the
big powder brush which is just so so
soft they're all synthetic really soft
and the blush brush which I actually use
the bronzer to contour with and the
buffing brush foundation and a stippling
brush for foundation and tinted
moisturizer and this little one which is
a contour brush is good for highlighter
as well so I really like them I just
think they do the job they clean really
easily and they look nice they look like
long you can stand them up which has the
bad example this one you can write stand
up and your dress
or you can put them in a little cup like
this like I do deputy candle cup um yes
they clean well they apply makeup really
well there's synthetic they're soft
they're just really really good and they
sell them in Boots so go and get them
the next product which also had a
massive hype around it it's kind of an
obvious one and it's the urban decay
naked palette and this is the first 1i
haven't got the second one because I
just don't think I need any more
eyeshadows so this is what it looks like
it's got a selection mainly of like
neutral shades quite shimmery and then a
few dark ones and up here I actually
don't use these two on the end which are
quite blue and but all the others i
really like and i especially like
half-baked which is really gold and
naked which is I came at a really good
of your crease and but actually side car
smog I'm kind of just reading through
all the colors now I think I like them
all but they're really good is I think
this may have been like the first
product from urban to carry ever bought
I ended up having to buy in sephora in
South of France because it was sold out
here everywhere and I saw it there water
straight away I think my sister bought
is well for her wedding it's just got
all the colors you really need and it's
easier to take away in this sort of
casein it does get it grubby because
it's like felt material but they're just
really really good quality in this cook
opened my eyes to the quality of urban
decay's eyeshadows as well so I think
this is worth getting it's still out and
so go and look at the this one and the
naked to sort of see which ones more
your colors because I think they could
choose more cool tone colors and this
one's a bit more warm which is good for
me and next up is the MUA professional
eye primer and this isn't a hyped-up
product but this is just something that
I thought I'm going to give it a try and
I'm kind of looking forward to see how
it compares to other primers because it
was I think I got pound or something mua
products are so cheap there solid
superdrug and it's kind of similar to
the Urban Decay potion primer I think
it's called cited potion and it's kind
of in one of these applicators and it
comes out the same sort of kind of
creamy color and
this is amazing I think it's better than
that Urban Decay one it's so so much
cheaper it makes what I makeup lasts all
day and I literally don't think I need
to try any other eye primer it's perfect
it does the job and I think if you do
wear eye primers you should try this
because if it does work for you then
you're saving yourself a lot of money
and I'm really impressed the mua's a
really good friend actually so that's
the eye primer and I recommend you try
that oh my god I've actually got so many
products here let me just space them out
a bit in a bit confused ok the next ones
are lip products and these are the
Revlon lip butters which I've got here
and these two quite a while to come to
the UK they came out in America first
which is where I got them because I
happen to be on holiday in Miami when
they first came out so I went a bit
crazy you can ask my boyfriend and my
sister and brother-in-law who I
literally dragged to every drug store in
Miami and New York just so i could find
every color i think i actually bought
every color I know what's wrong with me
I think I was like high on holiday mode
I don't need every color by bought loads
I've got more in my drawer these are
just my favorite ones so the ones I've
got here a berry smoothie sweet tart
cherry tart and cotton candy and you
mean to pick that up that's not one of
my favorites I think it's just ds3 and
cherry tarts like a proper proper red
and needs to a kind of more pinky and I
think they're really good there the
colors really strong and they feel like
a lip balm they're really moisturizing
there in this cute packaging and you
wind up but like the Dior lip sticks and
I think they're really good they do what
they say they do and they're not too
expensive and i think if you want to
wear lipstick but you're bit intimidated
by a find it quite hard than these are
perfect because they're like a lip balm
but with good color not like the rubbish
colored lip balms are hardly show these
are like proper color they're pretty
much lipsticks so i'm really impressed
with those i think they did very well
all done revlon i think there's a really
good another lip products that's also at
a drugstore I for all of these out of my
drawer for some reason
to make easier to hold and these are the
kate moss lipsticks I don't remember
what made me first try these I think it
may have been Jen from beauty junkie
London who just mentioned that she liked
the kate moss lipstick so that they were
really good quality so i went to try one
and literally the first one I tried I
was so impressed which I was the first
one I don't remember which one it was
but they're just so so good that either
I've said before they're my favorite
drugstore lipsticks by far they're so
creamy and easy to apply they never
drive get my lips like never look flaky
um really nice colors nice packaging I
just think they're really good actually
no better than a lot of a mac lipsticks
though and I was really surprised I was
looking forward to trying it but it beat
my expectations and just I'm really
impressed I think they're really good
lipsticks and you should try them if you
like drugstore lipsticks or even if you
don't actually because these are better
than most you should go and try the kate
moss lipsticks and from Rimmel did I
even say their room or their room and
living ass um the next couple of things
and blushes and I've got two of the
Tarte Amazonian clay blushes that i got
in sephora in America when I was there
and this one's exposed and this one is
tipsy and these are really nice and they
fold open flat which I really like in a
blusher they're gone they've got a
really strong color a really nice color
range lots of other ones as well I
wanted to get that I'll probably will
get soon I just really like them I was
really excited to try like a new brand
when I got these and I can't remember
who said they were really good but I was
really excited to buy them and they I
was really impressed I really like them
so if you are near anywhere that sells
these a Sephora or if you want to get
these online I would recommend it so
yeah anyway I'm rambling now but these
are really good and I can't remember how
much they were I don't they weren't
cheap they weren't crazy expensive but
i'm glad i got them and
I'll definitely want to try more but I
did not ever finish these you need the
tiniest tiniest amount but they're
really good another blusher is the
benefit coralista everyone always talks
about this and everyone always talks
about how expensive benefit blushes and
bronzers are in general because I think
they're like 25 pounds or something and
I think benefits quite confusing brand
because of the imagery they use in the
advertising and marketing so sort of
bubbly and young and cute and colorful
you kind of expect it to be a bit
cheaper it's not like you know Chanel
packaging that's all smart and black and
so you know it's expensive so I think
people always a bit shocked when they
get to the till and they get told that
this is like 25 pounds um because
definitely like a bit more high end and
expensive so it's a little bit confusing
but i have a few blushes from there and
i do like them all but the corrilesa is
amazing and i got this ages ago but I
use it all the time I'll definitely
repurchase it if I run out I actually
don't know where the bottom is I don't
know where I'm going to run out but I
love it in the old packaging which I
love because then I can use for the
brush in here and then put it in here
I'm not even talking since you know I
mean like brush it in there so I don't
have too much on the brush it smells
amazing it literally smells amazing do
you even know what it's supposed to
smell like and even if i don't know if
it's supposed to smell of anything or if
it's just the natural smell of it i
don't know i'm going to find that out
afterwards that's going to annoy me but
yeah love the packaging the products
amazing it's perfect color and i'm
really glad i got this it's definite
thumbs up from me and and then I've just
got two more things and one of them is
the nooks lip balm Chad choir bloggers
hype around it it's the revd Emil lip
balm and this was like 10 pounds which
is crazy for a lip balm it's in a nice
like frosted glass jar and I really like
this it's really different to a normal
lip balm it's oh my god I've just broken
the lid
I'm literally broken the lid I can't get
it open one sec okay I don't know I did
there but anyway and it's kind of like a
mat you can see it's a yellow color and
it's kind of a map to lip balm it's not
like really slippery or shiny it Matt it
has it feels a little bit exfoliating as
well so it's not like great to put under
lip products like lipsticks I don't
think but it's nice to use on its own
especially overnight because it's really
moisturizing and you should scoop out
loads I think at first I was trying to
like my finger like that and wasn't
getting much use to scoop up quite a bit
and put it on I think it's really good
I'm happy I got that and I think it was
worth the hype that little hype that I
had around it and then the final product
which is my favorite is the bourgeois
one second magic nail polish remover and
this is basically a pot filled with like
black foam and there's a little hole in
the middle and inside it's like soaked
with nail polish remover and you may
think like what's the point why don't
you just remove your nail polish but one
I find it quite annoying having to I
always do my nails downstairs in the
lounge quinine has to take cotton wool
nail polish remover and all these
separate things it's quite nice to have
it all in one second of all it's really
quick you put your finger in it's not
quite one second I think that's bending
the truth slightly but put your finger
in and like swirl around like that if
you like push it against the sides as
well it really helps and and then it all
comes off and it's got like nice oils
and stuff in it as well so and whereas
normal now question me that makes my
nails fill their butt week this makes it
from really moisturizer and when I take
my nails out and they're quite oily I
just wobble in the oils to my cuticles
and I think it's really nice and it's
not great for glitter nail polishes but
it does work i discovered if you just
leave a finger in there and it sounds
really way but if you like pump the
bottom then you get quite a lot of the
liquid and the nail polish remover so if
you do that and sort of leave a finger
to soak for a bit then it does actually
take Lister off but be warned that the
glitter will stay in there so you'll
probably get gift sir if you put your
finger in it again in the future I think
it's really good lasted me ages I
haven't run out yet i don't really know
when you've run out i guess when it's
dry but i'll get another one straight
away it was cheap and it's so easy take
it on holiday to work
and I love it I just think it's amazing
i know they used to do these like back
in the day but i don't know i forgot
about them and no other brands bore them
back so now it's back again I'm i love
it i hope it doesn't go again so I think
that's everything my floor is like
covered in products but I think that's
everything for this video and so those
the products I was really happy with and
I hoped you liked this little two-part
video thing let me know what you thought
and if any of those products that i just
mentioned in this video where they use
them as well so thank you for watching
and I'll see you soon thanks bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
