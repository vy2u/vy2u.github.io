different ways to wear a red lip and how
to kind of build the confidence to do it
as well my friends often say to me I'm
so jealous you can wear a red lipstick
and there's no reason why anyone can't I
used to be petrified of it and it's just
about finding the right color and the
right texture to seat you so I really
hope you guys enjoyed this all the
information on the products I'm using
they're going to be in the info bar
below this video so go and check that
out and thanks for watching I like to
start by prepping my lips and I do this
by exfoliating using the fresh sugar lip
polish I take a little bit on my finger
and just gently rub it all over my lips
and this gets rid of any dry patches
that might show you through the lipstick
I then use a lip balm on top and I'm
using my favorite SIMEX lip protector it
is a very glamorous but it works really
well so I just layer it all over the
lips
my advice is to start with something
easy like a tinted lip-balm
I love the Reverend lip butter in cherry
tart it's just really easy you can apply
it straight onto the lips and you're
left with a gorgeous sheer red finish
now you're ready for a moisturizing
lipstick and I love the Clinique chubby
stick intense in Mightiest maraschino
it's a really bright bold red but
because it's so moisturizing they're
still really easy to wear and you can
apply it straight from the bullet
remember if you make a mistake by durm
as your friend
revlon also did some great moisturizing
lipsticks
this was fire and ice and revlon red and
they're really affordable
so you're not quite ready for a matte
lipstick yet but you want to wear a
proper red lipstick I love this one from
hell and ethos mythix it's called
Hollywood red and I'm applying it with
the Real Techniques detailer brush I
like to just outline my lips at the
lipstick doesn't have to be very neat
but it just makes it easier to apply the
lipstick
don't forget the finger trick to make
sure you don't get any on your teeth
so you're ready for a matte lip this
one's Mac Russian red and I love this
one for an intense red lip I definitely
recommend using the lip liner with a
matte lipstick though it really helps
this ones Mac cherry and more affordable
one would be from anyway
I just use the lip liner to line around
the lips it's kind of as simple as that
once you have a funny line around your
lips you just use the lipstick to fill
it in with matte lips I like to block
them on a tissue and then reapply on top
and this just makes them last longer
especially on the night out
the Rimmel Kate Moss lipsticks are
really great maps affordable lipsticks
if you want to try and more drugstore
brand I think once you rocked the Mac
lip you're ready for lip lacquers as
well which can give a really amazing
intense red lipstick what I love about
red lips you can wear a really boring
plain black outfit and if you wear a red
lip you automatically look that you made
an effort
everyone thinks a red lip is really
dressy but I actually prefer wearing it
with a casual outfit so thanks for
watching and I really hope that was
helpful some of you if we do end up
wearing a red lip because of this please
tweet me at Lily pebbles or Instagram me
