it's vlogmas day 20
probably would say 20 not many days left
I'm just making the muesli before my
friends come over there come in about an
hour we're having a very casual brunch
nothing fancy I've just made muesli I've
got a scrambled egg and avocado because
I think that's what Keisha liked and
we're just gonna sit and catch up it's
gonna be really nice to catch up Keisha
she's back from Jamaica for Christmas
I'm just chopping up all the apples I've
already put some yogurt in the oats and
some maple syrup and then I'm gonna add
the apples and I think I've got nuts and
stuff that people can just add if they
want I will knock them out it's like the
main bowl okay I've made them easily and
I've just left it in the fridge for now
and I'm like made it quite plain because
I figure people could just add stuff too
if they weren't so full raspberry
blueberries
maple syrup honey I'm gonna put some
spoons out in bowls and then if anyone
wants eggs and avocado I'll just make
that for their most what's the sourdough
bread as well I decided that I'm only
gonna vlog until the 23rd because we're
going up to Suffolk on the 20 well we'll
get up in the 23rd but the 24th or just
spending the day with Rich's family so I
don't really want to vlog I just want to
relax and enjoy some time with them and
also the internet won't be that great
for uploading and I don't really want to
be editing on Christmas Day last year I
woke up Christmas morning had to edit
the 24th and that was like really not
that enjoyable I just want one day off
Christmas day and then after Christmas
Day I've got about four videos I need to
film because I haven't had time to film
them because of vlogmas so the last vlog
will be up on Christmas Eve on the 24th
but then there won't be one up on
Christmas Day but you guys will be busy

lot from the previous one but JJ Abrams

a good day in general highlight of the
day was probably Bailey my nephew's
learnt the entire all the words and the
theme the theme and the melody to the
Oasis song from the John Lewis advert
obviously that's the only reason he
knows it but it's a great song and he
knows the whole song and he sung it to
me and it was really really cute I hope
you guys have enjoyed today's vlog
thanks for watching and I'll see you two
more like oh wait rich has a thought of
the day yeah my thought of the day is
why is there kilograms and pounds and
what's the other stuff only meters
metric versus imperial why is it two
different ones and why did we start with
one and convert to the other and then go
back and forth and why you should have
one you've gone blurry but it's for the
best really right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
