want to say thank you so much for your
lovely feedback on both my Milan videos
I had such a lovely time so I'm so glad
you like the videos that I made when I
was there today I'm going to be talking
about my top 10 makeup brushes which I
have here and I am just obsessed with
makeup brushes I find myself buying them
all the time and really kind of
researching and investing in good ones
because I think there's no point having
good makeup if you don't have good tools
to apply it with so I'm gonna talk you
through my top 10 favorites and
hopefully this will help you if you are
looking to invest in some new brushes I
have a lot of Real Techniques brushes so
I'm going to talk you through all of
those first Real Techniques is a brand
was started by pixie roux Sam and Nick
who are some of my favorite youtubers
ever they started their own brush line
and it's really amazing you can find
them in boots and they're really
affordable but they're also really good
quality like some of the best I've ever
tried first one is the blush brush and
it looks like this and I don't actually
use this for blusher I use this for
bronzer I think it's the perfect size
it's slightly tapered it's a little bit
longer than your average brush so I find
it really good for getting into the
contours of your cheeks and after your
temples I don't like using huge bronzer
brushes this is just the perfect size
for me all their brushes are synthetic
which I don't like synthetic brushes for
everything but for the majority I really
like them they're much easier to clean
and therefore really soft
the next real techniques brush I have is
the multitask brush and this is more of
a recent purchase for me because it's
slightly harder to find I think they
only sold it online for a while but I
found this in super drug and this came
in a set of a few other brushes I really
like this one because it's slightly
wider and dode at the top I like using
this one for blusher because I think it
applies the perfect amount of product
right onto the apples of your cheeks you
can kind of press it in or blend it and
it's really soft it washes really well
this one and I just really like the size
of it and it's a perfect blusher brush
the next one is I think my most used
brush ever and it's the buffing brush I
talk about this all the time and it's my
one most favorite brush for applying
foundation and things
anyone I really use I have to and I will
turn it so I can wash them in between
its domed it's pretty similar to the
multitask brush but it's slightly
shorter it slightly wider this is
perfect for applying foundation I just
swirl it around like this and buff it
into the skin and I find with a lot of
brushes they kind of soak up liquid
foundations and you end up kind of
losing a lot of product and this one
doesn't do that at all I don't know why
what the difference is between the
synthetic bristles because other
synthetic brushes I've use have just
soaked out the product so I know what it
is maybe to do how dense the hairs are
but this is perfect it doesn't soak up
any product it leaves you with a really
kind of flawless face everything buffed
out perfectly blended and this is just
probably my all-time favorites ever
makeup brush wow that is something the
final brush from Real Techniques is the
setting brush and this is my choice for
concealer I tend to apply my concealer
with like any kind of flat brush that I
have and then I blend out with this both
under my eyes and on my face I've tried
so many different brushes and I feel
like a lot of them don't move enough so
they just end up kind of stabbing at the
product and not blending it properly but
this one moves really nicely and blends
out your concealer and it's a really
nice fit for under your eyes and around
your nose and on your chin this is a
really great brush I think it was meant
for powder but I love it for concealer
the next brush is problem Bobby Brown
and Bobby Brown I'm known for making
amazing brushes I really wanted to
invest in a couple of good ones I got
one for shadow and then I got this one
which is the sheer powder brush it's
super soft I literally cannot explain
how soft this is it's so nice and I use
this for blusher I think this picks up
the perfect amount products it's
something there's something about the
bristles that picks up powder really
well and it's it's smaller than the
multi-task so if I know I might have a
brighter blush and I don't want it to go
all over my cheeks I use this one
because you kind of have more precision
when you're applying it it would be nice
for highlighter as well but I just use
this for blusher it's just such a
beautiful brush and I know it's one
that's going to last me a long time
because it washes really well and just
stays soft
next up is a brush from Charlotte
Tilbury
this is the powder n Scott I've
mentioned before that I don't love the
feeling of this brush as much because
it's not quite as soft it's a little bit
more Scratchy but it does make it good
if you're using with powder because it
picks up the product a little bit better
one thing I love about this brush is the
way it's made so the handle isn't round
so it doesn't roll off a table I think
that is really clever and this one's are
slightly more tapered so this works
really well for contouring so you can
get right into the hollows of your
cheeks it works nicely for highlight and
it goes to be really good for powder I
think I use this a lot for powder for
under my eyes and around my nose it's a
really good shape brush and I find
myself using this below two different
things
so either is a brand I have been loving
for about a year now they make such
affordable good quality brushes it
pretty much like Mac dupes but a much
lower lower price the first one I really
like is 105 luxe highlight and this is
quite different to any other brush I own
it's a really small dome shape so I'll
compare that to the Bobbi Brown blusher
brush and the Real Techniques buffing
brush it's just a little bit smaller and
tapered it's just the perfect size but
pop it on a bit of highlighting the top
of your cheekbones and this probably
worked well for contouring as well but I
have brushes the bit more tapered I
prefer to use for that this is really
nice and soft it washes really well and
I just think their brush is a really
good quality I have a couple of eye
brushes from zoeva as well that I love
first one is the two-two-one luxe soft
crease and they have a few different
kind of crease brushes but this is the
one I like the most because it's the
most kind of fluffy and domed and I feel
like this is just perfect for blending
up that color into the crease of your
eye but you can also use it to apply
color all over the lid so it's a bit of
a multitasking I brush as well I have a
few of these and I'm reaching for them
every day they're so good for applying
eyeshadow mine has frayed a little bit
around the edges after washing it but
there are a little bit cheaper so
they're not going to last as long but
for how cheap they are I think they're
really good quality and I think they're
much softer than the Mac to all sevens
which I find to be too Scratchy and I
don't think they pick up for
as well as these ones which are soft and
really easy to blend this eyeshadow
brush from zoeva is just one of my
absolute favorites is the 231 petit
crease and I'm skating from the name you
meant to use it in the crease but I
personally love using this for under my
eye for applying eyeshadow I like to
wear quite a lot of eyeshadow underneath
because I feel like it just flatters my
eye shape and this is the perfect size
brush for doing it it moves around a bit
so it's nice for blending I feel like
some brushes for under your eye or to
shorts and stiff so it's quite hard to
move the product whereas this was really
good for blending it out and I have a
couple of these as well and I use them
every day for eyeshadow under my eye
final brush is a little bit of an
expensive 4 and it's around 50 pounds
it's from our okay this is their powder
brush and it is amazing I couldn't not
mention it first of all I love the size
the brushes are really short so they're
really good for traveling and they've
got this nice like matte black candle
but what's amazing about the rmk brushes
is the quality and how soft they are I
cannot even explain to you how soft this
is I just need to have a moment with
this brush oh my god it's so nice I am
desperately wanting the blusher brush
now after trying this this is the powder
brush so I'll use this with my Mac
mineralize skinfinish or my hourglass
ambient lighting powders and it doesn't
apply too much product on so you never
look too powdery it just kind of gives
the perfect little wash layer above your
oh my god it's happening again until my
touches on my face I gave it a bit of a
moment I know it applies the perfect
amount of powder never look to kind of
cakey or powdery and I cannot explain
how soft these are even though they are
expensive they are deep for the suku
brushes which are crazy expensive I will
never be able to only see if you brush
but the blusher version of this is so
similar to the suku one that Lisa
Eldridge always uses so it's definitely
on my wish list and these are beautiful
brushes if you want to invest so those
are all my top ten brushes and I hope
seen which one's my favorites are I love
makeup brushes so hopefully if you guys
are looking to invest and sell this gave
you a few ideas leave a comment below
letting me know what your favorite
brushes are and hopefully I can add some
more to my wish list thanks so much for
watching and I'll see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
