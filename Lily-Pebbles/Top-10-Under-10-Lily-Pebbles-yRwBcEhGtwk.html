my top 10 products for under 10 pounds
so it was really hard to pick just ten
of my favorite drugstore products and
put them in order but hope you I've done
it and I haven't forgotten any of my
favorites but just before I start I
wanted to mention and run around Revlon
nearly naked foundation didn't quite
make it into the top ten but I really
like this foundation and it's probably
my favorite drugstore foundation it's
really light but still gives good
coverage and leaves a nice kind of glowy
dewy finish it's a bit annoying that
doesn't come with a pump which is why I
don't use it as often as I'd like to but
I really like the formula of this and
I've been wearing it quite a lot
recently and just reminded me how much I
love it so at number 10 are some of my
favorite drugstore nail polishes and
it's the bourgeois one second gel nail
polishes I've got a few colors here and
the color range isn't huge and it's not
the best but the formula of these is
amazing the brush is really wide and
it's really easy to apply and the
formula as the name suggests is quite
gel like so they last a really long time
and I just love these I especially love
using the more toes the brush makes it
really easy to apply and I'm obsessed I
really like the long handle as well it
makes it really easy to hold the brush
and yeah these are definitely my
favorite drugstore nail polishes
at number nine is my favorite drugstore
mascara and that's Maybelline the rocket
I've spoken about this quite a lot I
really like it gives me loads of volume
and length in my lashes as I mentioned
before I have quite long curly lashes
anyway so I think it's probably quite a
natural mascara but I really like it and
it's great for everyday use
at number eight is the Rimmel
scandaleyes eyeliner in nude and before
this came out it was really hard to find
the nude eyeliner in the drugstore I had
one from Mac and these are really great
to put in your waterline just to kind of
open up your eyes make you look more
awake especially when they're a bit red
and when this came out I just was
obsessed I've been repurchasing ever
since it's so nice it's really soft and
creamy so it doesn't hurt when you put
it in your waterline and it's just so
good that you can get these in the
drugstore now because I think everyone
needs one of these in their collection
they're so good especially for early
mornings my number seven is something I
literally cannot live without and it's
the bourgeois one second nail polish
remover for those of you who don't know
what this is it's basically just a pot
filled with foam that's soaked in nail
polish remover so you just put your
finger in and wiggle it about it takes a
nail polish straight off and it's so
handy you means you don't have to have
nail polish remover and quartz and wor
line around it's really compact it's
great for traveling and it's got really
nice oils in it as well so when you take
your nail out it doesn't feel all dry if
it was really nourished and soft and I
love this I really like the smell
something hate it but really it's just
so convenient means I could paint my
nails like every other night and it's
not a faff at all it's just so easy
at number six of the Rimmel scandaleyes
eyeshadow paint and this was just one of
those launches this year that blew me
away I absolutely loved it Lucy looked
like lip glosses they go on really wet
and you can either blend them out with
your finger or brush and once they dry
they just set and don't move at all this
is the longest lasting eye products I've
ever tried without a doubt I sometimes
use these under other eyeshadows or just
on their own
there aren't amazing colors hopefully
they'll bring out more the two that I
like a rich russet and golden bronze but
I don't really like any of the others so
that's a bit of shame but the quality of
these are amazing and I always wear
these when I know I've got like a long
day ahead I want my makeup to last
because they really do last at number
five are the Real Techniques brushes and
these are made by Sam Chapman from Pixie
Roo these are some of the best brushes
I've tried whether it's drugstore or
higher affordable and such good quality
they wash really well as well my
favorite ones are the buffing brush
which is from the core collection the
setting brush and the blush brush that
use for bronzer but there are so many
good ones seriously apart from Mac these
are my favorite brushes I actually think
I prefer them to Mac just because they
are so affordable I'd really recommend
these whether you're starting out makeup
or with you we won't make it for a long
time my mum also uses these and loves
them at number four it's one of my
favorite cream blushes and it's the Max
Factor miracle touch creamy blush and I
have this in soft pink again these don't
come in the best color range the soft
pink is really nice and I just love this
it's definitely my favorite cream
blusher it's very sticky in lip balm me
which means it'll last a long time your
skin I don't really like cream to powder
formulas because they just don't last on
me so this is so nice it comes in tiny
cheap packaging but the product inside
is amazing so I definitely recommend
giving it a try it's so affordable and
just such a good quality
so we're getting close to number one at
number three is the rimmel apocalypse
lip lacquers and everyone went crazy for
these when they came out and I'm not
surprised because they're so good
they're very similar to my hourglass lip
lacquers but I actually prefer these
because they don't kind of dry as matte
and they're not drying at all they're
basically just a wet lip lacquer you
apply on it's very liquidy and wet but
as soon as you kiss your lips together
they set and it doesn't move at all it's
just so long-lasting Rimmel and really
good at their long-lasting formulas the
two colors I have here a Big Bang which
is a true red and Stella which is a
bright coral and I love these are really
easy to let get precision application
and it's one of those things you
definitely wear on a night out because
you know no matter how much you drink or
you need it's gonna last all night at
number two at the Maybelline 24-hour
color tattoos and I love cream
eyeshadows they're so easy to use and
easy to wear you just apply a bit on
your lid with your finger and they last
all day but these are particularly good
and very affordable my favorite colors
are on and on bronze and pomegranate
which I haven't actually used that much
because a little bit harder to wear but
on non bronze I've just used so much
it's my favorite cream eyeshadow really
good for people who are at school and
just need an easy makeup look you just
swipe this on your eyelids they last
really well they're really good formula
and that they don't dry out I've had my
faders and it hasn't dried out although
I'd really recommend these and again
really affordable
so at the number one spot I wonder if
you guys have guessed it it's the Revlon
lip butters and I'm sure a lot of you
that are thinking really they're just a
tinted lip balm but I really love these
and I just think they're one of the best
drugstore lunches that I've come across
they are basically just a tinted lip
balm but they're pigmented enough that
you can wear them like a lipstick and
they're still lit barmy enough that you
can apply it without a mirror and I just
find myself wearing these all the time
there's always some in my handbag my
favorite colors are very smoothy which
is a really good everyday color sweet
tarts which is a brighter and cherry
tart which is a really nice red
especially if you're new to red
lipsticks I just think these are really
nice they feel really moisturizing on
the lips and they look great and I just
loved them I just think they're so good
and they have so many colors in the
range to pick for and there's definitely
one to suit everyone so those are my
number one favorite drugstore products
under 10 pounds so hope you enjoyed that
and hopefully found some new products
