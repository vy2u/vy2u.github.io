when I did my top five red lipsticks
video today I'm going to do my top five
nude lipsticks now just a little
disclaimer they're not really nude
because I don't really wear like proper
old-school nude lipsticks what I call
nude is kind of easy to wear everyday
lipsticks most of them are a bit like
this kind of soft pink the sorts of
lipstick that if you do a really smoky
eye you can just put this on and you
know it will go something you don't
really need a mirror to apply it's kind
of like a pinky nude so that's why I'm
calling nude if you're into like the
really skin colored nude this video
won't be for you but it was really easy
to pick my top five lipsticks these are
the lipsticks I've loved for so long
most of them only have a tiny bit left
in so I'm gonna get started and I've got
all the swatches on my hand again so I
can remind myself off the colors they
look really pretty actually like that
and the first I'm gonna talk about is
the most nude out of all of them it's
from a Kiko I don't have the exact name
of the type of lipstick and number but I
will find out and put it in the
description box below this is from there
like creamy lipstick range there they
have so many different types of formulas
at Kiko you guys know I love Kiko and
this one's really cool it comes in is
really fancy packaging you pop the end
out and then it looks like this although
it's creamy and moisturizing this is the
most matte out all five lipsticks I'm
going to show you because the other four
are quite glossy this is a really kind
of quite thick creamy formula and it's
that soft pinky nude shade and I find if
I put this on too thick it can look a
little bit kind of strange but I like to
just kind of Pat it in rub it into my
lips and it's a really nice nude to wear
with a Stokey I I definitely recommend
Kiko lipsticks they're really great the
next one is a lipstick you would have
heard me rave about for years if you've
been watching my videos or reading my
blog for a long time its Mac syrup this
is the second lipstick and I've nearly
finished I go through these so quickly
this is just my go-to lipstick well I
don't know what else to wear it's so
easy it's a it's a source of pale pink
this is literally all that's left I
can't wind it up anymore to show you I
really need to get a new one it's like a
soft pink but it's got kind of purply
tones to it which I really like it's
quite cool compared to most lipsticks i
normally wear but i just think it's so
pretty it's not one that people would
normally go for because it looks very
different in the bullet
it does on the lips but it's such a nice
everyday lipstick I really like matte
lipsticks this one is a luster which is
slightly less creamy then the cream
machine ones or chrome machine I don't
know what it's called
but I really like lustres I find them
really hydrating and easy to wear next
up is one from the drugstore and it's
one of the Revlon lip butters yes you've
guessed it it's the one I talk about all
the time at berry smoothie this one is
probably the most pink out of all of
these five lipsticks but it's still so
easy to wear on like an everyday basis
it's a glossy kind of pinky lip balm
these are so comfortable and hydrating
on the lips it really is just like a
tinted lip balm again I've nearly
finished this one as well it's my
favorite shade out all the Revlon lip
butters so easy to wear you can really
rub it into your lips for a softer color
or you can wear it quite bold for like a
really nice berry toned lip you don't
need a mirror to apply these they're
really moisturizing hydrating and
actually last on the lips unlike most
tinted balms my fourth favorite nude
lipstick it's another one from Mac and
it's patisserie I talked about this one
a lot it's really great for layering
under lip glosses where they're they're
nude or slightly pink it's the most I
think this is my favorite nude lipstick
again I think this is the second one
I've gone through there's only a tiny
bit left in this it's a really nice
creamy soft nude this is one of their
chrome seen lipstick so it's very creamy
really hydrating on the lips this is the
one I always go for when I'm going on a
night out and I've got a really kind of
intense smoky eye I always match it with
patisserie it's got kind of peachy tones
in it as well which I really like and I
think this is a favorite of a lot of
beauty bloggers it's just such a great
staple lipstick final lipstick is from
Dior and this is I think it's number 363
blush but I'll confirm that and write it
in the description box below
these are super fancy and I hadn't tried
to do lipsticks before this was the
first one that I bought it took me about
an hour to figure out how to open it I
was literally trying every way but you
actually just grabbed this little thing
at the top and the lipstick comes out
there again I haven't got much of this
left it's a really pretty soft pink I
feel like I'm saying the same thing for
all these lipsticks that they are or
very similar as you can see this one's
really moisturizing and glossy
definitely don't need a mirror to apply
it this is the one I'm wearing now
actually so it can be quite pink if you
wear it quite
I have involved with this in on my lips
but a bit like the lip butters you can
really work into the lips and wear it
quite sheer doubt I say this is the most
similar in tone to patisserie because it
has slight peachy shades in there as
well I really love the formula of these
three lipsticks they're so easy to wear
I wouldn't get like a bright red or a
bold color in this formula because it's
a little bit kind of slippy before nudes
is absolutely beautiful so those are my
top five nude ish lipsticks I really
hope you enjoyed seeing them let me know
if you get them all right because they
are all favorites that I've spoken a lot
about in the past I see you guys on
Sunday for my next video and thanks so
much for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
