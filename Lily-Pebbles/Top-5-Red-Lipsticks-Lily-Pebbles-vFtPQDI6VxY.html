to be talking through my top five red
lipsticks I'm sure you'll be very
familiar with most of these lip products
but I've never actually made a top 5
video so I really wanted to do that for
one of my smaller Thursday videos my
hand is covered in swatches just so I
can remind myself as I talk through them
the different shades and finishes but I
am going to be swatching them separately
as well so you guys can see exactly how
they apply and how they look on the lips
it actually wasn't that hard to pick my
top 5 because these are the ones that I
always go back to and I feel secure
wearing them I can trust that they're
going to last on my lips and look good
so I'm going to go through one by one
but let's start with the one I'm wearing
and this is one of the Bourjois Rouge
edition velvet this one is in hot pepper
absolutely love it it's really bright
tomato you read the formula of this is
quite strange it's kind of like a liquid
lipstick but it's quite jelly ish I find
it's quite bouncy when you apply it it
feels very light and quite watery a
little bit like a stain but it really
does set in place and stay put all day
it doesn't feel a little heavy on the
lips I really went off the hourglass
Rouge Opaques because they were so so
heavy and drying on the lips whereas
this you can hardly feel it when it's on
because it's that bright poppy red I
feel like it's really flattering it
really kind of brightens up your face
this one stays the wet for longest out
of all of these you do kind of either
have to Pat it to dry or just wait and
let it dry but once it does it stays
there and I think it's a beautiful red
lip and it's very affordable the second
one is from Sephora and it's one of
their cream lip stains this is in shade
0-1 which i think is always red and this
is another kind of liquid lipstick
formula this one dries the quickest out
of all the lipsticks and it doesn't
budge at all when I made these swatches
you can see some of them are quite
smudgy but this is this for one and it
is completely just stayed perfect it's
quite a nice kind of darker red and it's
really easy to apply with a little kind
of applicator you don't have long to
work with it though as soon as you apply
it kind of dries and sets and this is
the hardest one to remove out all my red
lipsticks it's amazing that this is the
one I would wear if I was going to like
a special event and I really didn't want
my lipstick to smudge it's an amazing
formula and if you don't already own one
of these and you like red lipstick this
is definitely an essential this is
probably my favorite
all of them actually if I had to say it
feels a little bit more drying than
others then the bourgeois one especially
but it does last that a little bit
longer I feel like that's why it feels
drying it's not as heavy as that
hourglass oh papers okay the third read
comes in a pencil form this is one of
the NARS Velvet Matte lip pencils which
are great they are slightly drying I
feel like they're not my kind of Holy
Grail products because I do think
they're a little bit drying on the lips
and I also find it quite annoying that
you need to sharpen them so you have to
have a slightly bigger sharpener but
there's no denying they have a beautiful
selection of shades and it's a really
nice kind of matte pencil finish this
one is dragongirl which I don't know if
I'm allowed to count this as a red
because it is quite pinky but it's kind
of like a Reddy pink which is a sort of
pink that I can wear because I need my
Pink's to be quite warm and this is
definitely a mix between a red and a
pink I think it's so kind of like fiery
and pretty I really enjoy wearing this
and because it is a pencil it's quite
easy to apply but just be aware if you
do have dry lips make sure they're kind
of moisturized that morning before you
wear it but I love the Naz matte lip
pencils so definitely worth checking
them out if you haven't tried them
before but if Naz redid them with a
twist up that would be amazing
next up is definitely not going to be a
surprise to you guys it's from the
Charlotte to a broom matte revolution
range which is my favourite matte
formula for lipsticks they're so
lightweight and luminous and easy to
wear they're just so comfortable I can't
even describe to you how comfortable
these are she has a special shaped
bullet that's kind of square as well
which makes it really easy to apply this
is red carpet red which is probably the
darkest red out of all of these it's
very flattering there it's very kind of
20s very chic these aren't like crazy
matte they won't budge if you were to
smear your lips these would smear as
well but they're matte enough that they
stay in place when you're eating your
food or if you're going out and drinking
and as I said they're just really smooth
and velvety and they feel great on your
lips the final read from my top 5 it was
kind of a toss-up between two but in the
end I had to go for an old favorite if
you've watched my channel for a while
you might remember this lipstick it's
from Helen a cosmetics which still is a
brand that I know nothing about I've
never tried anything else from them but
I got this in a glossy box years ago
it's their Hollywood red it comes in
this tiny little round of lipstick
packaging but it's just an amazing red
lipstick I always go back to it it's
very
motto bright red very Marilyn Monroe red
but again this doesn't feel too matte on
the lips but it lasts a really long time
this just I remember wearing this when I
was a Paris ones and I went out for
dinner we were eating and drinking and
it didn't smudge at all it was just
really easy to wear and I kind of liked
that it's just a bit random and no one
else ever talks about it so I don't know
what I would do if I ever run out of
this I need to find out where Helen Eve
cosmetics is actually stocked I wanted
to mention a few extra ones just because
I know this is going to be quite a short
video but little shoutout goes to Mac
Russian red which is a lovely matte red
lipstick this one is quite similar to
the Charlotte's Hillberry red carpet red
in it's a lovely matte lipstick when it
comes to lip liners my top three would
be from Urban Decay there 24/7 lip
liners are seriously long-lasting and
really smooth they don't drag your lips
at all this shade is 69 but they've got
loads of different nice Reds Kiko do
really nice lip liners this is from
their Ace of Diamonds collection again
really kind of smooth to apply and
long-lasting and Mac cherry of course a
beauty bloggers favorite I literally
couldn't live without this lip liner it
goes with most Reds which is great to
apply under a red lipstick because then
if your lipstick does start to fade
you've got this underneath as like an
extra insurance so those are my top 5
favourite red lipsticks let me know if
we have any in common or if you thought
I missed any that you couldn't believe I
didn't mention I'm pretty happy with my
top 5 so if you guys enjoy this video
and next week I'm actually going to do
my top 5 nude at lipsticks so don't
forget to come back to watch that but I
should see you on Tuesday for a weekly
vlog see you then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
