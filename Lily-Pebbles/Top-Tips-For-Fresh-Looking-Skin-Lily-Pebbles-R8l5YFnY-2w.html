sitting here in my comfy clothes but it
is Sunday after all and I thought as
it's a new year a lot of people might
have a skincare routine on their New
Year's resolution I think looking after
your skin is really important and I
don't think it's just about looking good
I think it's about being healthy and
feeling good and having a good daily
routine and I just thought instead of
doing this skincare routine and
overwhelming you with products because I
do use a lot of skincare products just
because I enjoy it I thought I would
talk through some tips on how to get
into the skincare routine how to keep it
up and a few things that I think are
important you guys know I'm not a
skincare expert I'm just a person with a
youtube channel but I am quite
passionate about makeup and skincare and
I've figured out something that works
for me I've never had acne so I don't
know anything about actually I can't
help with that I have normal quite dry
and dehydrated sometimes the skin I am
quite lucky I have quite good genes but
I do have spotty days as well and I
thought this might be interesting for
you guys anyway if you are looking to
look after your skin more this year so
the first thing I would say is make time
for your routine every day just like you
would with having a shower or brushing
your teeth or eating a meal make your
skincare routine important to you so
that you always have time to do it no
matter how much of a rush you are in I
make sure I at least wash my face every
morning and night no matter how late I'm
running in the morning or no matter how
tired I am at night I think if you just
make it part of your daily routine after
a month or so you just get so used to it
that it's become second nature you don't
even really think about it so that's
something I would say is really
important you have to keep it up I also
think just keeping your skin clean is so
important forget about the oils and
serums and all of that for now cleansing
your skin I think is the most important
obviously depends where you live but I
live in London and when you go on the
tube you come back in the evening this
is gross but if any of you have come
back on the tube and blown your nose
you'll see the color of the crap that
comes out of your nose all the elements
and pollution and crap that goes on your
skin is so important to keep your skin
clean and it just clog up your pores so
think of it that way and I think that's
what kind of got me into it because I
used to always
face wipes that I was younger my mom
used to always try and convince me to
just wash my face with a cloth with some
water with the cleanser and I just
didn't really get it and the more I
thought about how dirty my face must be
that kind of made me want to do it more
so just think about keeping your skin
clean it's so important and it'll
definitely help you age better or so
just so you know I'm really not into the
whole anti aging thing I think aging is
a really wonderful thing and I think
that wrinkles and fine lines don't have
to look terrible and deep and you don't
have to have leathery skin when you're
older for me it's not about making sure
I have no wrinkles it's just about
keeping healthy plump glowing looking
skin my next tip would be to find the
right balance there are some products
that take away from the skin and some
products that give for example
exfoliators take away or acid toners
take away but hydrating serums and oils
give to the skin and I think for me it's
finding that balance between the two
those two types of products that I kind
of struggled with but now I found it I
find really helps my skin somedays I
know that my skin can't handle having an
exfoliator an acid toner or charcoal
masks some days it just wants to have
serums and oils and hydrating masks but
having the right balance I think is
where you get that kind of perfect skin
somewhere in the middle there find a
routine and stick to it
even when traveling changing your
products all the time is just not going
to work for your skin I think it
confuses your skin and it doesn't give
it a chance to really get used to a
product that's why skincare is quite
hard for beauty bloggers to test out
because I think it takes quite a long
time to figure out if you really like a
skincare product or not you have to use
it for a good a few months so find that
cleanser or the exfoliator or the mask
that you like and you don't have to
change unless your skin stops enjoying
that product you don't have to change it
and I always find when I go traveling
and I buy minis in Boots or whatever of
different products my skin always gets
bad because it likes the products that I
use at home so you can just buy little
tubs and little tubes and decant your
products into there when you go
traveling I think if you can try and use
the same products even when you're away
if the routine works then there's no
need to change it I always tell my
friends do
/ exfoliate I don't know what it is
about Foley 18 but all my friends have
this obsession with exfoliating I think
people think when you exfoliate it just
gets rid of your spots in it just
removes all the gross things on your
face and it really doesn't and I think
over exfoliating can be really bad for
your skin I actually never use a
physical exfoliator the one with like
grainy bits in it because I just find
that it's too harsh on my skin and it
doesn't feel nice it hurts my face I use
acid toners instead to exfoliate they
are a bit more gentle I think but even
then like once maybe twice a week some
people exfoliate every day and I think
that's really bad your skin if it works
for you then fine but I tend to say to
my friends and family try not to
exfoliate all the time you just don't
need to and your skin will just be
stripped of all its natural oils and
then it will just try and generate more
oils and then you just become oily and
it's a bit of a vicious circle really
someone once told me I think it might be
Caroline hyerin's years ago not to wash
your face in the shower and I didn't
really do it anyway but it makes so much
sense that water that you shower with is
so hot they're putting that in your skin
no wonder I used to come out the shower
with such blotchy red patches all over
my face and that's because I have quite
hot showers and it's just too hot to put
on your face and if you're cleansing
your skin and letting all the hot water
in it's really not a great idea my
always try and remind rich because he
cleanses in the shower so if you can try
and do your skincare routine before you
get in the shower well not your skin
harity I didn't take my makeup off then
shower and then come out and do my whole
skincare routine but I wouldn't
recommend kind of scrubbing your face
under the hot shower water not great
your skin and I know it's a time-saver
but I'd say try not to do it and my
final tip is just to say that skin care
alone really isn't enough I think a lot
of people think that skin care is like a
quick fix it's not a quick fix a lot of
products won't even work in 30 years
time I think it's an ongoing thing to
just look after your skin but really
drinking alcohol smoking and sun damage
will really affect your skin sun damage
in particular I know some people who
spent their whole kind of teenage days
lying in the Sun and they get such thick
leathery skin when they're older
and no matter how tanned you are it
doesn't look good if you have leathery
wrinkly skin so definitely don't lie out
in the Sun and if you're going to be in
the Sun wear SPF if you can but I just
thought I'd say but I think a lot of
people think that skin cares like I'm
going to try this mask in the next
morning I'm gonna wake up and my skin's
gonna be amazing
I just don't really think it works like
that but I think having a nice daily
skincare routine is enjoyable I love
washing my face and putting all my oils
and serums on I think you could start to
really enjoy it if you just get into a
good routine and find the products that
work for you let me know if you want me
to do an updated morning or evening
skincare routine I pretty much use the
same things I love that osteo renascence
cleansing gel I love the Sarah Chapman
serums and oils a lot of the skincare I
use is quite expensive because I
personally like to invest in skincare
but I mentioned Caroline Horrors earlier
definitely go and check out her blog she
is a skincare specialist and she knows
everything about the subject so go and
look at her cheat sheets they're really
helpful if you're just getting into
skincare so I hope you liked this video
and if skincare is on your new year's
resolution hopefully this helps you a
little bit and maybe gave you a bit of
inspiration to get started thanks so
much for watching and I'll see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
