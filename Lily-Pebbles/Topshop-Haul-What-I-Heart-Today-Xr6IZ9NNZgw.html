personal shopping event and it was held
in the Oxford Circus branch it was
basically an evening where all the
personal shoppers from all the Topshop
branches in London invite their clients
to preview the new edited collection and
do some late night shopping once the
circus store closed
there's obviously amazing because it's
normally really busy there the personal
shopping service at Topshop is actually
really good it's free which I think that
most people don't really know and you go
this amazing dressing room it's much
nicer than the normal ones that they
give you like cupcakes and drinks and
they basically go and grab all the
clothes for you you can tell them what
you want or they can pick it for you and
they bring it all into this one room and
they sort put it into outfits and it's
like the most relaxing way to shop ever
I can't believe more people don't use it
it's free and he doesn't minimum spend
or anything that's amazing so I went
with my friend SJ but a really nice
night drank loads of champagne and sort
of a new edited collection which was
really nice and then did some shopping
so I thought I'd show you what I bought
because I spend quite a lot of money but
I did have some vouchers leftover from
my birthday in December that I've been
saving so it wasn't quite as bad in the
end so this is my big bag quite a lot so
I'll just go through a trade first thing
I got was some makeup makeup bag pretty
like paper bags actually they remind me
of sort of old sweet shops
so I got two nail polishes this one's
called pool party this looks a bit like
the politic right now but the one I'm
wearing now is SC mint candy apple so
that's this one sort of a greeny blue
and then this one is forget-me-nots and
that's of a pale powdery blue that's
really nice as well so I got those two
and the nail polishes are five pounds
each which is sort of it's okay I don't
mind spending that hopefully they won't
chip so bad I think they'll depends on
the color of Topshop nail varnishes
sometimes they really show up sometimes
they're okay so I'll see with these ones
and let you know and also on the night
because it was a special event with
every purchase they were giving away a
free gift and this is what the Freak if
it looks like it's got a little PS his
personal shopping and I haven't actually
opened mine yet come on to do it on
camera but I've seen my friends it's
really nice I'll show you it is they see
it looks like that now the back it shows
what's in it with the nice little
illustrations so this is a really nice
little makeup palette which I thought
was really nice gift to give especially
when you're spending a lot of money oh I
can't get into it
so the palette looks like this inside
basically have some eyeshadows lip
colors and a blush it's a blush looks
quite nice actually like that bright and
now I'll show you what clothes I bought
it's go a bit crazy and I really wanted
to get some sort of bright colourful
clothes because everything I wear is
always black and gray as you can see now
and so for coming up to spring so forgot
to think ahead so first thing I bought
was this little cream cropped sweater so
it's got short arms and it's quite short
as well and then it's got sort of lace
flowers on the front I think this is
really good sort of go over shirts and
things with collars I bought something
else which went really well with it's
just main reason why I got it and this
was 38 pounds which is quite expensive
but you can't feel it it's really really
soft I think that'd be quite useful to
put lots of different things the second
thing it actually went and looked inside
which I never really do I'm not very
good shopping in sales but I did find
this which I was really happy with it's
like a neon orange jumper it's got sort
of lace detail all over it's literally
bright orange this also it's really nice
to have dresses or shirt so it's just
quite easy thing to bring color to
outfit which is what I really need today
and so this was reduced from thirty six
pounds to 18 pounds so that was really
good and I really liked that quite suits
me
the next ring
these léa léa my favorite jeans from
Topshop I used to wear Jamie but then I
realized that they just stretch and once
they stretch you can't shrink them so
I'm at fairly
they are thinner but they're much
skinnier so I got them in this amazing
baby blue turquoise color just like
there's never a little turn ups at the
end I really like these it might be hard
to find things to wear with them I think
everything else has to be kind of mutual
colors I always get them in a sort of
size smaller than what I am just so
they're really really skinny and the
last thing I bought which is the most
expensive thing but I think the thing i
love the most is this dress so it's
bright orange it has a nice collar and
buttons down the front and then it kind
of goes in at the waist and then it's
pleated here so let me see if i can
stand up for you and show you what it
looks like kind of go stood there on me
um yeah she really suits me and I tried
this on with the little white sweater on
top and it looks really good and so I'm
really happy with this it was 50 pounds
which is quite a lot and that's me
doable but I think I've got a lot of use
out of it I can wear it now with black
tights and so big chunky jumpers on top
and I can also wear it in the summer as
well I was quite worried what shoes go
with it but actually my black Irish
boots do you look really good with it so
I'm happy about that so yeah that's
really nice
and that's all I got so it may not seem
like that much but I spent quite a lot
of money cuz the top shops very
expensive and I'm really happy with
everything I got and I'm really excited
to wear it so um I hope you like seeing
why I bought and thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
