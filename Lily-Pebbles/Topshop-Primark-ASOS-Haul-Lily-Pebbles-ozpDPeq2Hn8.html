and today I'm going to be doing a
gigantic haul video this is all fashion
clothes and maybe one pair of shoes I do
this kind of twice or three times a year
ago on one giant shop I'm not really one
to kind of find things every now and
again
I actually don't really enjoy shopping
for clothes I find it quite stressful
and I always end up buying the same
things so what I do kind of twice a year
is I go out and I try to buy things that
are a little bit out of my comfort zone
I like kind of having my own style I'm
always gonna wear black skinny jeans and
boots it's my thing but I like to kind
of add some color in every now and again
and I've noticed that I have been
wearing the same thing a lot recently
and because I do a lot of filming like
on this channel and for daily mix I find
myself constantly thinking gotta mine
the same clothes all the time for every
video so I wanted to go out and get a
few different bits and I got quite a lot
whoops but as I said I don't do this all
the time so I better get started because
there is a lot here and I think I'm
gonna start with the bits that I found
in Primark and I'm not one of those
people that goes into Primark refines
all the best stuff I really struggle to
shop in Primark and also I think the
prices have gone up and it's becoming
you know not that cheap anymore but
sometimes I find some real gems and I
got a couple of bits last time I went in
so the first thing I got was just this
plain God I said I've tried buy
different stuff and I'm starting with a
plain top but you know it's good to have
some basics in your wardrobe this is
just a great op and what I like about it
is that it's got a zip all the way down
the back and then it's long sleeve and
slouchy and it's got this nice kind of
line subtle line down the front and I
just like wearing things like this for
layering they're really good if you
don't you know it's where you're putting
on your black jeans and a nice jacket
and you can just kind of layer this
underneath in the UK it's always really
cold so it's good to buy stuff you can
layer it with the other thing I got from
Primark I absolutely love and it's this
sweater it's a really thin knit but it's
really cozy it's gray and it's got white
stripes all over it no it doesn't have
white stripes all over it it's got white
stars all over it what am I talking
about today I really like star prints
they're really cute and fun and like I
really like hearts on print so stars
I much prefer and this is really cozy
and comfy
and again good for layering you can wear
it more as a top or you can wear it as a
jumper you were like under Blazers
because it's thin enough and I really
really like this
I also popped into Urban Outfitters with
my mom and I don't normally do a big
shop in there because it is quite
expensive and I just never really find
things that I love all the things that I
do love are always kind of 90 pounds
which is just crazy but I found this top
and it was only 35 pounds which I think
for Urban Outfitters is really good and
I like it because it's quite different I
feel like you won't see everyone wearing
it and anyway I'm going to show it to
you it's this top it's kind of marine
color and it's kind of see-through it's
really hard to explain but it's got this
really pretty print in its t-shirt like
a loose t-shirt so I'd wear it over a
black vest top and I think it would look
really nice showing through like a black
blazer just something a bit different I
think it looks kind of vintage II it
looks a lot more expensive than it is
and you wouldn't really think it was
airborne Outfitters so I really like
that and that's definitely a good one to
wear for like filming because you can
see my nice pretty top then I also
popped into hmmm I like to get H&amp;amp;M for
my basics again
I don't like spend too much money in
there because I feel like the quality
isn't amazing but I like the H&amp;amp;M trend
stuff and you know I wanted a skirt that
I could wear under sweaters or if I
could tuck a sweater in and wherever
tight and I saw this one and I just
thought it's really cute it's a bit like
a schoolgirl skirt and it's got this
print on it and it just goes out but not
doesn't go too far out that it's like a
bit too much and then it's got a little
zip on the back and these like this is
really comfortable to wear I'm all about
comfort that's the thing about my style
you will never see crazy stuff because I
will always pick comfort over style I
just don't care that much about looking
good I will never be uncomfortable I
won't wear heels or shoes that hurts I
like to be confident all times so anyway
I really like this together I like how
its cuts and I think it looks pretty
also now let's get onto the Topshop
stuff and this is where I bought the
most stuff I actually was just walking
around the Topshop in Westfield with my
hands you know when you have so many
things you can't even hold them in your
hands and a nice lady came up to me and
said would you like to come up to the
personal styling room and I know about
this because my friend used to work
there so I was like yes I love it up
there and they basically have this in
the big-top shops is two or however many
huge changing rooms you can go in and
they'll get you any sizes you want and
you don't have any obligation to buy you
don't have to pay for the service you
don't even need their help if you don't
want it but if you want their help
they're there and then really can't be
changes like sofas and stuff and yeah
they get Commission when you buy stuff
and you do have to pay for it so it's
just a really nice enjoyable relaxing
way to shop so very much enjoy joy that
I probably I forgot it was there I'm
gonna do that every time I go to Topshop
it's just so much easier and also you
can take as many things into changing
room as you like you know with the
normal ones you can only take six I find
that really annoying I always take two
sizes of everything in because I'm never
sure anyway stop babbling the first
thing I got is this top again I wanted
some nice tops and this hangs really
nicely it's quite heavy it's got white
sleeves that are longer than t-shirt
lengths like 3/4 length and then there's
kind of pretty black and white print and
I just think this is really nice it's
just one of those tops that will be good
for smarter days I also picked up these
trousers or trigons which I like trouser
leggings jeggings jeggings these words
very silly am i actually bought these in
the wrong size at first I got them in a
12 which is my size but they're a little
bit big so I'd say these come up quite
large so I went for the ten in the end
so they're like leggings that they have
a zip on the side and you can wear them
as trousers they're really stretchy so
they're very comfortable they come up
quite short they're kind of like ankle
grazes which I think I look really nice
with boots and these are kind of velvety
with a little triangle print I know
there's a name for this print but I'm
just not cool enough to know these
things so I will link everything that
I'm talking about below and you can go
and see for yourself but yeah these are
so comfy and it's just a nice change I
always wear black jeans so they kind of
had the same effect but they're a little
bit they looked like you've made more of
an effort basically next up from Topshop
of these three sweaters and they are all
the same I couldn't choose between them
so I got them all by the way there were
a lot of things that I didn't get from
this Topshop trip I had to narrow it
down in the end but I think all the
things I picked I'm definitely gonna
wear so I really like these sweaters
they are really quite thin you can wear
them as tops but they're just so
nice for layering and I love the colors
they come in I got them in gray kind of
neon yellow and then a bright orange and
I think this is an easy way to inject
some color into my wardrobe because I
can wear these with my black jeans I can
wear them under jackets they're just so
easy to wear and really comfortable and
you know and you just can't even think
about what to wear it's pretty easy to
just throw on a bright top and again it
looks like you've made an effort when
you really happen
the final thing from Topshop is this
jacket and it's quite smart it makes me
feel very smart when I wear it but it
looks like this it's gray and black kind
of crisscross print and I like these
little jackets I think they look really
flattering and smart on and you can wear
them over a jumper like this to make it
more casual or you can wear it over the
top that I showed from Topshop and make
it a bit more small it's good for the
day and the evening and I like how you
can wear this under a big coat because I
find with some jackets you can't wear
them under things and it's just too cold
in the UK to wear a little jacket alone
so I like this because you can wear it
as a cardigan under a coat and then when
you go inside take your coat off and you
still look smart you have to walk around
in a teacher or anything and I really
like that as well okay next up is a
sauce and I don't shop on ASIS that
often only because I find I'm always in
between sizes whether it's shoes I'm a
six and a half so I could be a six or
seven I never know and clothes I'm
either a 10 or a 12 so it's always
really hard to tell and I end up sending
things back and forth the whole time but
eventually I got the right sizes in both
of the things I got from ASOS first
thought is this dress and I'm not going
to show this on because this is a dress
that I am wearing to the Brits which
would have been yesterday when you're
watching this video I went Wednesday and
hopefully I'll be uploading video on
that on Sunday so you'll see me wearing
this in all its glory
but only one it's so heavy it's this
dress I actually got it in the sale it
was 120 pounds down to 70 which still
sounds like a lot but if you could see
this in real life it's so embellished
that it's really really heavy it's
covered in sequins and embellishments
and it basically looks like this it's
nice in glittery and it's like a t-shirt
style so it's not too I don't like
wearing kind of strapless tops I just
feel like awkward but it's quite short
so you can wear it
legs and still look really smart and I
think it's so elegant and pretty and I
think it's something that will last a
really long time and again it looks like
it's from like a vintage shop just such
good quality it's got a zip down the
back and I can't wait to wear this I
have absolutely no idea what shoes I'm
wearing so you will see in the video
what I decided on in the end but I think
I'm going to go with like a clunky heel
because I'm just not girly enough to
work proceed with all dainty Hills also
from Asus I bought some shoes and I
actually love Hudson shoes you will see
for my Instagram or my outfit photos or
any outfit videos I do that I'm always
wearing my Hudson boots I've had them
for a year and a half and I think and I
pretty much wear them six out of seven
days of the week and I know it's boring
but they're so comfortable I love them
so I get good use out of them so wants
to get another pair of Hudson's because
I love how comfortable they are so these
are the pair that I got I got them in a
six and they were too small and send
them back and finally got them in seven
they look like this they have this is
just the label but they have a zip down
the back and then they have this like
cutouts on the side and I think this
looks so nice especially with ankle
grazes I got from Topshop because you
can see this detail around the ankle and
popping out they're pretty plain black
boots with a wooden heel but I just know
I'll get good use of them then I think
to kind of in-your-face they will go
with everything and because they are
Hudson they're so comfortable and I know
they will last years so really happy
with these and can't wait to wear them I
think I'm going to give them their first
outing today and finally the last thing
is from Zara and it's a bag and I saw
this online and just thought I have to
go see it in real life it looks so nice
and it was 20 pounds which is probably
overpriced for something like this but I
just thought it's really cute I really
like it it's a white clutch bag and I
didn't if you can see but it's embossed
it says stressed and then on the other
side it says but well-dressed and I just
think that's so cute and I like these
big touch bars because you can fill them
up and hold them under your arm and you
look like you're going to New York
Fashion Week even though I'm not but I
can pretend that I am I think this is
really cool I really like this I don't
know if I'll wear this to the Brits or
anything it goes with my dress
which is a shame I have to find a bag
somewhere
my collection to wear but anyway that's
everything I did not buy it all in one
go but not gonna lie it was quite the
close leaf space together I just needed
to get new clothes you own your wardrobe
just feels like has nothing in it and
this will last me a good kind of four or
five months I think because even though
it I know you guys think we're going
into spring and all the clothes and the
shops at spring it won't be spring here
for quite a long time it's still going
to be cold in London for a long time so
if you guys enjoyed seeing what I picked
up and let me know what your favorite
thing is that I bought and if you have
any of them as well thanks for watching
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
and I'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
