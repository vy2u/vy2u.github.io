haul I don't know why I'm wearing
something that literally looks like a
pajama top for a video about fashion and
clothes but it's really comfortable and
that's just what I'm gonna be wearing in
this video the weather is slightly
improved in the UK there's like sunny
days and there's rainy days but when
it's sunny I just have the urge to go
out and go shopping and buy a whole new
spring wardrobe there's like two times
in the year where I go shopping crazy
and from winter to spring is definitely
one of them
I just get so bored of my winter clothes
and want to kind of refresh my whole
wardrobe so over the past two months
I've been doing a bit of shopping here
and there this definitely wasn't bought
all in one go I can't do that I'm not
one of those shoppers I just feel too
guilty afterwards but here and there
I've been picking up some pieces and
trying to buy some like different stuff
to what I normally wear as well so I'm
going to show you everything that I
bought this Topshop Zara estas
Victoria's Secret's
so let's get started I think I'll start
with Topshop and I'll start with the
most ridiculous item in this whole whole
whole whole that's hard to say it's a
yellow raincoat I love the yellow
raincoat in Urban Outfitters but it's
like 160 pounds or something crazy I saw
this one in Topshop how much is it it
was 55 which is still so expensive fact
that I've still got the tag on means I
haven't worn it but I'm hoping this will
be good for when it's kind of April
showers so it's still warm but it's kind
of a bit rainy festivals and all that so
the inside of the hoodie is checked like
a little picnic blanket looks really
nice and it's just bright yellows great
it's like waterproof it's got these big
pockets like fisherman coats and I
really really like it and I think that
it's just quite weird and funny I also
bought some dungarees I can't believe I
bought dungarees like three years ago
there's no way I would have been seen
dead in dungarees but there was
something I wore when I was about 10 and
looked ridiculous but I really like the
black dungaree look I feel like it's
very Alexa Chung I tried the one in the
changing room took a photo tweeted you
guys will seem to like them I wasn't
sure how flattering they were around my
tummy area but then I went back and
bought them they are quite shorts on the
lake and you can kind of roll them up
once which i think is way more
flattering than if they were baggy to
the ground and dungarees these days have
a little zip on the side so there's
slightly more fitted and I just really
like that
so comfortable but then you kind of look
a bit trendy as well but actually you're
just really comfy they have a pocket on
the front great for your vlogging camera
I just think these are really cool and
why not try something a bit different
with a little coaster apt underneath I
think it would look really nice
I also spotted a purse in Topshop I
don't usually buy purses while I happen
but one in years because I have my new
Miu purse but I just kind of wanted to
switch up a bit for spring because my
nume purse is Right dark blue throw
wintery I'm getting a bit bored of it
but I don't want to kind of get rid of
it so I feel like if I buy a cheaper
purse to use for a bit I'll probably go
back to my mew-mew one so I saw this in
Topshop and I really love the pastel
kind of grey tones - it's got a hood
dark grey a light grey and like a light
pink and I just think it looks really
nice together so looks like this it's
got big pocket on the front which I've
put like business cards in and then it
opens up like this you've got like a
clear pocket here for my driving license
loads of space for cards and then space
for like receipts and stuff in there and
money which I never have it in here oh
and there's two zips as well so you can
put your coins in there there's just
loads of storage space in this purse I
was really impressed and I think it's
kind of pretty and it wasn't expensive
so it doesn't really matter if I get
bored with it here one more thing from
Topshop this has foundation marks on it
classic it wasn't from the shop it was
from me just now taking it off which is
very annoying to watch this now this is
from Topshop
I spotted this really liked it had no
idea that this was the top that Ana was
after because apparently Barbara
perjured me put this in her video and I
was telling them all about this top and
then I bought this and I had no idea
this was the top that she was talking
about but it's really nice it's
high-necked
which is quite flattering I don't
usually wear sleeveless tops but there's
something about this I just really liked
it I tried it on and the side has this
kind of panel which is a bit different
but it doesn't like show your boobs
I'll show you stomach or anything I do
like to wear a little bit of like a crop
top bra thing on top of my bra just so
you can't see my bra and now that sounds
weird I think if you have like small
boobs you can get away with it but I
have like one of those ugly bras for big
boot people I like to wear like a nice
thing I've got from Urban Outfitters on
top of my bra and then it kind of shows
through a little bit on the side but not
too much and it's just a really nice
shape
it also splits at the bottom and hangs
just really nicely I wore this on beach
I think with just jeans and I thought
it'd look very smart but casual and
really good quality as well I like that
top okay Victoria's Secret I never shop
in Victoria's Secrets I think it's quite
tacky I used to love it when I was
younger and now you go in and everything
just has pink written on it I just don't
understand why you would want your
clothes to say pink on them it's bizarre
but I did want to have a look because
now I do Pilates every Friday I'm one of
those people who does Pilates now I
needed some tops just to wear but like
naik workout leggings I've had for years
and I just wanted some loose tops to
wear I don't really like sweats much in
Pilates but it's just nice to have a
loose top and they were doing a deal
like two for 25 pounds or something so
these are just be neck tops and they're
quite long so they cover your bum
because I think when you are legging
like I don't want to wear a thong when
I'm doing Pilates so I have like a
massive terrible nickel line and in my
legging so these are nice because they
just cover your bum so I got it in like
bright green and I got it in this nice
blue as well so nothing special but just
kind of handy to have around whistles
recently partnered up with Grazia they
do this like twice the twice a year I
think it's great regrets you have a 25
cent off code we actually don't really
need the grass here like I always go
into whistles and they just give me the
25 percent off but their tell cry
serious at that I went in to have a look
and I spotted these trousers and they
were really expensive but then with the
25% off they were cheaper there was
still pricey and I was humming and are
in a lot I was with my mom and she told
me have a think about it so I walked
around and then I went back for them
because I thought I don't have any any
trousers I always wear black skinny
jeans and I'm so bored of that look all
the time so I thought these are a really
good alternative so they're quite fitted
and structured they have a zip down the
side they have pockets on the front and
back and then they have a nice kind of
seam down the side and they go in at the
bottom with another zip at the back
really hard to explain but they're just
really fitted they're small but if you
wear them with flats they can be quite
casual really nice alternative to black
skinny jeans the only problem is you
can't really wear boots with these sort
of trousers so I do have to wear shoes
which I find not as comfy as boots when
I'm walking around all day but I just
really like the look of these they're so
high-waisted that you can wear kind of
cropped tops or jumpers with them which
is great if you don't like showing off
your stomach I'm really really happy
with these I'm glad I kind of invested a
bit more money in them because they feel
like they're something
a staple in my wardrobe and great for
days where I want to be smarter so those
were great to purchase for me I've been
loving wearing those this was very much
an anna inspired purchase she also
bought this that i think she saw in
Barbara's video and then I saw it on her
visa chat like I was like I need that is
from ASOS but it's from a brand called
weekday I think they're owned by the
same people that do monkey oh I'm not
sure if there's a shop in London though
I need to look into that I know you can
get a nice sauce it's a really nice kind
of I don't know if that teal it's kind
of like a teal color and it's a shirt
it's this really soft not velvet suede
but it's like the soft material I can't
explain I should probably look a bit it
was say what it's made from Modell I
don't even know what that material is
but it feels really nice and it hangs
really nice it does crease very easily
which is annoying because can't really
travel with it and when you sit down it
gets quite creased it's got a really
pretty neckline warning again with the
crop top thing when you bend down you
can kind of see down the shirt so I like
to wear a little crop top if you have
big boobs these big pockets on the front
that are really flattering is slightly
longer at the back I like to roll up the
sleeves a little bit and I just think
it's really smart and a gorgeous color
something a bit different I like to have
smart shirts in my wardrobe I think they
kind of go with skinny jeans or with
trousers
I really like that shirt so okay finally
Zara if you watched my Paris vlog you
would have seen that we went to Zara a
lot of people have asked me where that
Zara was it was on the same road as
hotel cost I'm not sure what road that
is but it's like a small editors are
with only the best stuff it was so so
good
I got a few things from there I was
definitely on like holiday mode and I
was with Chanel and I decided I wanted
to be really Chanel so these are quite
different the things I would normally
wear and I still haven't decided if I
like them or not but I'm not sure that I
can even take them back so I'm thinking
I should just keep them and give them a
go when the weather improves first item
is skirt I don't ever wear skirts but
this has a zip off the side it's
high-waisted and it's kind of
monochromes like black white and beige
and it just kind of goes out a bit I
really like it I just don't know if it
suits me but I will wear it I think with
tights it's really nice so I should
probably start wearing it soon before
it's not tight season anymore I also
picked up a two-piece which is very on
me this doesn't really go with tights
I've tried it but I think when the
weather gets warmer and I can wear bare
legs this will be kind of cool you can
wear them separately all together
although I like
when you wear a two-piece together I
think it's way more of a statement so
the top looks like this it looks a bit
like a pajama top it's got this huge
check print on it I like to roll up the
sleeves and it's cropped and then the
shorts to go with it are very high
waisted they're very comfortable and
they're not too short I hate my shorts
are really short and they just like ride
up your bum these are really good length
so I'm just not sure if I love the print
I think it's a bit in your face but then
I feel like it's kind of cool and I'm
with Jersey people that could pull this
off so I'm gonna give it a go when it's
summer wearing these together I like
that the top is long-sleeved so it's not
too much skin I like to either have my
legs or upper body on display not both
so I like this is long-sleeve but then
it's with shorts and you can wear long
sleeve in spring summer in the UK
because the weather is terrible so I
think that's everything yeah that's
everything that I've picked up recently
I'm sure by the time this video goes up
I would have bought more stuff but it's
getting a bit ridiculous now I need to
kind of hide my purse and stop shopping
especially as I'm buying so many spring
things and the weather isn't even better
yet so please leave me a comment down
below telling me what your favourite
piece out of all the things that I
bought were and I'll see you guys in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
