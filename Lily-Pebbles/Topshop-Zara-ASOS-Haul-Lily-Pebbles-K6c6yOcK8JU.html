bit of a clothing haul now this is kind
of a collective haul because some of
these things I bought quite a while ago
and some are quite new I don't really go
out and buy a lot of things all at once
so I've been collecting it and keeping a
note of my phone so I could do one big
haul the gear for you today first of all
this hat and if you watched my bright
and flogged you would have seen me
actually buying this hat I found it in
urban outfitters in Brighton and I've
never been really a hat person I find it
really hard to get away with kind of
autumn winter hats I mean I can wear
beanie hats but not like black fedora
type things but this one's more like a
summary hat and when I tried it on I
actually really liked it I can kind of
put it on a bit now for you to see I
think it's really cute for summer and
makes your outfit way more summery just
by putting on a hat and I have a couple
of holidays platen this year so I think
it will be good for that as well in that
same Brighton vlog you would have seen
this dress that I was wearing with it
and this is a striped dress from H&amp;amp;M I
really like this because the material is
quite thick and weighted so it hangs
really nicely it's not kind of too tight
it's not too thin that it kind of blows
around in the wind it's just really kind
of good quality especially for H&amp;amp;M it's
Navy and white which I absolutely love
you guys know I love stripes I wear them
in pretty much every video but navy and
white stripes for my all-time favorite
it's quite a nice length as well it's
not too short but it's also not to kind
of be summary and I have a few photo I
actually met quite a few of you guys in
Brighton so I'll try and find some
photos and put them here because I'm
wearing the dress and the hat in those
photos I'm really happy with this
purchase and I think I wears a lot in
the summer talking of stripes I have
more stripes I'm just addicted but these
are actually pajamas and I needed some
new kind of spring pajamas because all
of mine were just I was waking up so hot
in the night I needed something my
bedrooms in the loft so it gets so hot
in the summer and freezing in the winter
so I got these it's basically they look
awful there's no way I'm going to film a
cutaway of new Erinyes but they're
really comfy so they're kind of high
waisted shorts which have this nice thin
loose material and then a crop top but
not too cropped I actually have my belly
out it's just kind of a short loose
t-shirt and they look really cute
together I mean it looks a bit
ridiculous but who cares no I'm
sees me in bed anyway a pot from rich
and he doesn't really care so these are
just thin lightweight and very
comfortable for the summer my next
purchase is a massive wardrobe staple
and it's these t-shirts I am wearing the
one in gray I've bought one in white
which I seem to have lost already and
one in black which you can see here and
these are really nice they're one
hundred percent viscose I things how you
say it which is normally material I stay
clear of because it makes you kind of
sweaty but in these ones it doesn't and
it's just really nice kind of waited
nice car it's a v-neck which I don't
normally wear but I quite like it the
sleeves are kind of short kind of fitted
especially the white one I've really
been enjoying wearing jeans I think
that's like my favorite summer look just
cut jeans and a white t-shirt and
sandals unfortunately these only come in
black white and gray so for every color
I possibly can but if they bring out any
more colors I would definitely buy them
okay next up with some trousers that you
will also seen in my Brighton flogged
and they are from zara I saw earthlink
the blog below it's called little magpie
and she is one of my favorite all-time
fashion bloggers she wore these and I
was on the hunt I went to every Zara
near me to try find them and I was so
happy when I did they have an
elasticated waistband which is thumbs up
points for me because anything
comfortable is in my good books so
they're high-waisted elasticated and
then they kind of like smart not linen
they look like linen smart kind of
material and then they roll up at the
bottom and I just really like this look
for some it is a nice change in wearing
tight jeans especially when it's
slightly warmer they have that kind of
loose casual look and with a white
t-shirt kind of tucked in or not tucked
in i think they look really nice and
with my birkenstock sandals which by the
way a heads up i'm wearing my
birkenstocks in all of the cutaways so
I'm sorry to not a fan I know some
people either hate them or love them but
I love them these charges are going to
get a lot of use in the spring and
summer I think and whilst dozen zara I
bought this top to go with it and this
is the only thing in this hall that I'm
not sure yet if I'm going to keep I've
kept the label on so you guys have to
let me know what you think it's this
little kind of cropped sweater and I
don't normally wear cropped because I
don't really like to get my stomach and
back out but something about this one I
really like and it's slightly longer so
I think with high-waisted trousers like
those ones you wouldn't actually see
much stomach
it's ribbed and it's kind of stretchy
and then it's long sleeved with ribbed
bit by the wrists and it's quite a thick
so I don't think I could wear it when
it's hot and imagine getting quite
sweaty in this but I don't know what I'd
really like this this is what I wish I
could just like but I just don't know if
I have the confidence to and I'm arming
an RN over this it's it's got the label
on and I just haven't decided yet let's
take it back it was 35 pounds so it
wasn't cheap let me know what you guys
think I'm not sure I think my boobs are
a bit big for it if you watch my Milan
lookbook video then you would have seen
this it is a top shops court and this
Court is basically short and a skirt
mixed so from the back it looks like a
pair of shorts and from the front it
looks like a very short skirt but i
don't really like wear short skirts
because i'm just don't like that you
can't sit on the floor and you were
worried people going to see your
knickers but with these because they are
shorts you have no fear of showing your
knickers so i really like this and
although i really don't wear many kind
of skirts I think this does look nice
with t-shirt or a little jumper it's
kind of an easy transition into the warm
months also good for a night out so when
I saw the new seasons are bug you know
every season dead like a dollar bag that
everyone gets its this one and I saw it
and thought nah not for me it's really
kind of floppy and it just wasn't into
it then my I think wasn't the Milan ship
came up and I really needed a bag to
take the pop to the passports of the
airport's put my stuff in and I went to
have a look at this one again and
actually once I really looked at it I
kind of fell in love it's huge so it
fits loads in and inside it has a
compartment to keep like laptops or
purses anything with you don't want
because it is open so that areas zipped
up and when it's full I actually really
like the look of it I like that the
handles are long enough you could put it
over your shoulder which is good for
airports and you can also kind of hold
it in your arm if you want to it is
leather is it leather no it's too cheap
to be real leather it's definitely not
real leather it also came in like a
cobalt blue I really liked but I think
they sold out so I got the black which
should last me for a good few years and
yeah it's really like this if you
watched my blog you would have seen that
my dog ate my jeans she does that a lot
it drives me insane so when I went to
buy a new pair
of lee jeans i also saw these which are
the Jamie's and they have the rips in
the knees and they've got rip on each
knee and then a kind of distressed look
up here and I know it seems ridiculous
to buy jeans that already have rips in
them I actually have a pair of jeans
that I ripped myself but because the
jeans are already quite old I don't
really like what the rest of the jeans
looked like but these are really nice I
haven't bought jamester ages i used to
buy them but then I found that they
stretched too easily so it's does
brenly's but actually when I try these
on I really like the fit they're
high-waisted and they kind of suck you
in a slightly thicker than Lee jeans and
I just loved the split knee and I roll
up the bottoms or they're not rolled up
at the moment and I think these look
really nice with just like a white
t-shirt and birkenstock sandals and I've
you wearing them a lot still on the
denim thing my next purchase is a very
on me scary risky one and I don't know
what came over me i was shopping with my
mom and she is dangerous she is a bigger
an abler than I am if you guys think I'm
an enabler you should meet my mom this
is from zara and i keep seeing this in
all the magazines because it's basically
a ripoff of one of the designer pieces
it's a denim looking it's not actually
denim it's kind of thin material
jumpsuit now hear me out I tried it on
and I thought actually this is kind of
cool it could look nice in the summer
with sandals it's really lightweight and
definitely comfortable I do look a bit
like something from the 50s I don't know
apparently only two people can get where
we're in these so maybe I should use my
tallness to my advantage this time I
think it's pretty cool but I know a lot
of people are going to hate this as well
I've still a label on just in case but i
think i'm going to keep it i don't know
when i'll wear it but if i ever get the
courage to i think it's really cool and
sometimes i need to kind of take a risk
with my wardrobe and this is my risk ok
so let's talk about jewelry a couple of
months ago I realized that I hate all my
jewelry and I really didn't have much so
I actually did a blog post on this which
I will link below I went to a few places
but mainly and other stories which is a
shot I really like it's owned by hmmm
but it's slightly more kind of high-end
it's a bit like cause like and they do
really nice jewelry so the first thing I
picked up at these rings which I'm
wearing on
ring fingers now and I think it came
like 10 of these tiny little rings or
wrapped together and I love wearing
these over the knuckle rings I think
they make your hands it really girly and
delicates they're really nice when you
have nicely painted nails which I just
realized my nail polish is chipped yeah
I really like this is a mix of silver
and gold which I also really like I also
picked up this necklace which is very me
because it's kind of grungy that's still
girly at the same time it had this kind
of metal chain and then all these little
gold rings that attached to the bottom
and this just hangs really nice clicks
it's quite heavy and it's delicate it's
not a statement necklace but it's
something to wear when you just feel
like you need a necklace this next one
you would have also seen in my Milan
lookbook if you watch that it is a
kimono from H&amp;amp;M and I haven't brought
any other kimonos since but I really
want to i'm loving this kimono trend i
would wear this with jeans or shorts
maybe it's quite long and it has this
kind of kimono arm thing going on and
this nice kind of print which it's not
animal print from far away it probably
looks like it is actually this is really
nice and floaty and summery and pretty
and girly and kind of festival sheep
okay the final item is another love-hate
one I got this from a sauce but it's by
the brand monkey which is a brand i
really like they have a shop in Carnaby
Street and I always pop in there when
i'm there it is a denim jacket and it's
a grey kind of stone washed and a jacket
and it's very very oversized I have like
a slight fear of denim jackets from back
in the day when I was 12 and used to
wear flare jeans and a tight dinner
jacket together and it is just
traumatized me for life but I really
like this one and I think the whole
denim on then and things slightly coming
back but even if you're not going to
risk you enough to do that this is
really nice ever address it's massively
massively oversized and I know a lot of
you guys are going to say it's not very
flattering but I like wearing oversized
things but I just I like that whole life
swallow me up effect this is just really
comfy i roll the sleeves all the way up
and i just kind of like look of it again
i probably won't wear this that much but
when i do i have enjoyed it so far so
that's everything a massive collective
clothing haul from ASOS topshop zara
maybe a few other places i really hope
you guys have enjoyed seeing what I
bought let me know what your favorite
pieces that I mentioned thanks so much
for watching and
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
