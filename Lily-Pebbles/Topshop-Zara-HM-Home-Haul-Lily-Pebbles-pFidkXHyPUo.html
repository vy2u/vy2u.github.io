really well today's video is going to be
a haul with a little bit of Russian and
a lot of hmm home if you follow me on
twitter my twitter name is add many
pebbles by the way if you don't and you
might remember that sunday where i
tweeted saying that everyone I knew was
watching the football so I went into
town by myself to go shopping which is
always dangerous and I bought quite a
lot so I thought I'd do a cool video I
went into hmmm home on Oxford Street and
I absolutely loved H&amp;amp;M home it's so
affordable and has such nice stuff I've
got like two huge bags worth and then
when you put it back in the car and
carried on shopping which is just a
really bad idea then I felt like I had
more anything anyway enough rambling I'm
gonna start with the fashion stuff and
firstly I picked up with a necklace from
Topshop I went to look at the necklace
to see what was there and to be honest
most of it I really didn't like but I
found this and I think obviously it's
quite a simple gold necklace and it has
two bands one selection than the other
and they both have a little kind of
hanging gold thing at the bottom I just
think are quite like simple necklaces
that you can wear with structures like
this and this was six pound fifty which
is quite pricey I think for what it is
but Topshop Junior is quite expensive
I'm going to put the prices for
everything I'm mentioning just for your
benefit in case you wants to pick it up
but please no one add up
what's my spend because I really don't
want to see that I can see all my
receipts then it's depressing enough as
it is so it makes a couple of bits from
Topshop and recently I've just been
wanting to make my wardrobe a bit more
spring summer like lighting things down
I wear a lot of black and as much as I
love wearing like I don't like wearing
it in the spring and summer because I
think it starts living a little bit
gothic when I wear black in warmer
weather so I went to buy a couple of new
pairs of jeans and haven't quite decided
if I'm keeping these yet so let me know
we thank first pair which are my
favorite out
two are just white and these are the
lead genes which are my favorite from
Topshop they're high-waisted they're
thin and lightweight they're ankle
braces they're super skinny and I really
liked them so I've got these a white and
usually I would say absolutely no ways
of white what I would have said that a
few years ago but I'm getting really
into I am I've got these all white
converse I think they look really nice
together and I think if you do it right
it can look good and not like you're
going to play tennis so these are the
Lee jeans they are the lead is 38 pounds
which is fine because the max I'll
probably paper is for jeans as 40 pounds
they last really long for me they don't
stretch too badly so I've got them in
white and then when I was going to pay I
also saw this color and I grabbed them
thinking oh maybe I'll take one back
then I kind of like we both are not
really the second hair is this kind of
pale blue color I like it cuz it's
pastel colors and I think it would look
really pretty in spring it's kind of
like a perfectly blue but only thing is
I think with this light color it doesn't
look that flattering around my
Electric's area my legs are quite skinny
but my hips aren't too small and I think
it's a little bit nice with a long top
but with a kind of normal size top I
don't think it's that flattering because
it kind of Jessup's like really pale
jeans so I'm not hundred such already if
they did have pink which I was gonna get
but it's just a little bit girly for me
so let me know what you think of this
kind of pale blue and there's obviously
the same price there was only jeans the
next thing I got is from Zara
I obviously love Zara they have such my
stuff men can be a little bit pricey I
saw this shirt I've already taken out
the bags they didn't want to crease it's
got a white collar and then the top half
is pale blue and the bottom half is pale
pink and it's really long and loose fit
and I really like this I mean I've got
it in a large yeah
got it a lot alone with it little bit
oversized and this was how much is this
$29.99 which is quite typical price for
as our our tops which like I think they
paid to spend that but it's probably
like getting to the max
I would spend on a shirt I really like
material is really lightweight so it's
not going to make you feel as sweaty I
think this is really pretty and I'm
really glad I got this the next thing I
got is from hmm and it was a pain in the
ass to find this I found this shirt in
one of the stores in Oxford Street and
they only had a size 14 which I normally
get a 12-inch shirt because then it's
slightly oversize but still fits me and
I thought I just try it on anyway and I
try number 14 and it was really
oversized but I kind of liked how it
looked but then I really like they had a
few black marks on there anything else
do they couldn't give me a 10% discount
but I can return it so in the end I
bought it and I went to get some other
stores to find if they had another one
to swap it and I went to like three
stores and in one of the other stores I
found one left and it was a size 14 so I
just went for the 14 in the end and it's
a white shirt it's really plain but it
kind of got back winged arms and it just
really loose it has this little like
slipped I feel like I'm gonna burn it on
that candle it's got a little slit down
here and I just really like the material
it feels like a really soft cotton I
don't think it is that things may not
like the viscose or whatever it's called
but it feels really soft and for hmm
this was quite expensive it was 30
pounds so it's the same price Bizzaro
shock I think it's a bit funny but it is
hmm trend which is like they're nicer
line and I really like it I think it
looks so nice with black jeans or with
the pasul jeans and I feel like a good
white shirt I wear a lot and again it's
not like a sweaty material so you can
later okay so he makes up is the hmm
home stuff and as I said I love H&amp;amp;M home
go in I just find so many things at once
by so I got a couple of new questions
I thought I could use these in the
background of my videos to make it a
little bit brighter and spring-like
because as I'm sure you noticed my
videos are quite dark and I had lots of
Burgundy's in my house and I've been
it's a little bit wintry so I'm trying
to brighten things up
so in hm you can buy the cushion cover
separates and if you want to buy the
cushions as well you can there are 50 by
50 cushions of 399 and the cushion
covers are $5.99 I think this is the
first time I got its mint blue and it
says vintage edition number three I
thought that was really nice and and to
go with that I bought the mint green and
white stripe you won so I thought those
together will look really pretty on the
sofa or on my bed and there's just so
many cushion covers to choose from an
H&amp;amp;M I think they have a really good
selection I also bought a throw slash
blankets on whatever they're called and
this is actually 30 pounds which again
in my head I think is quite a lot but I
know this will kind of last forever and
I could just use it for so many
different things so it looks like this
it's a really really light gray and it's
so soft it's got this sort of tassel in
on the end and it's huge
I'm not even going to open it all up now
it's gonna swallow me I love this
because you can just like sling them on
the sofa or you can put them at the
bottom of your bed or you can use them
as blankets and you're sitting on the
sofa they're just so nice and I love
these sort of textures I've got a few
throws Mike here and I can like lay this
on and I think it's really nice and I
think if you want to buy someone to
throw you but the ones from the white
company are so expensive even if you get
them from like a discounted store like
in Vista Village but they're so
expensive so these are a really little
fence if it was a very good quality
they're for cheap at all well it's not
cheap it's 30 pounds but it doesn't feel
cheaper than the white company ones ok
the next thing I got was a completely
ridiculous buy because I do not need it
at all it's a bowl but they've got this
new range hm
it says the state grocery market and I
really like this it reminds me a kind of
America Chicago II I don't know Whole
Foods kind of thing and I really like
this bar they've got marks and stuff to
go with it but I just got one ball
I don't eat my cereal out of it and this
was just $4.99 which i think is pretty
good if you have just moved out I'd
really recommend it hm H&amp;amp;M home stuff
the stuff so portable okay and then the
final thing is this wide basket this was
$12.99 and I have absolutely no idea
what I'm gonna do with it it's really
cute though I like it if you could
probably use it to like your underwear
in or use it in your bathroom and the
squares are too wide the products
probably want to fall through it I have
a website right when he's at yep four
but I really like the look of it and I
think it looks really nice this year
this 12 X and I mean I think it came in
gold as well but I just got the black
one so that's everything from my hmm
Topshop Zara and H&amp;amp;M home haul I really
hope you enjoyed seeing what I got
comment below and let me know what your
favorite thing that I showed you was and
I'll see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
