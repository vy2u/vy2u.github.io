have seen that I got up to it a little
bit of shopping the web has completely
changed in the UK and I was waking up in
the mornings and just finding it really
hard to get dressed and that for me
means I need a bit of a wardrobe
reaching so I've taken some of my summer
stuff out and I kind of been putting in
a few transitional pieces and what I
mean by that is things that can take me
from summer to autumn there are a few
bits really missing in my wardrobe so I
picked up some stuff and I thought show
you guys what I got this video should
come with a warning there's absolutely
no color in this hall I'm sorry it's
just the stuff I'm into at the moment
I'm really into monochrome but I'm
wearing color just to make up for it
it's a first of all topshop my favorite
place to go for clothes you just always
have so much stuff to pick from I was
really missing a certain type of shoot
in my collection I have boots I have
sandals but I haven't really got
anything in between because i always
find kind of the brogues and the slip-on
shoes really uncomfortable and they
really rub and I just will never wear
uncomfortable shoes nothing is worth it
but I saw these and thought they would
be perfect they're black faux leather
kind of pumps climp soul type shoes I
think that's what they're called they
have a white base which makes them
really kind of casual but because
they're black leather they look a little
bit smarter than your normal plimsoll
shoes they're lace up so they don't want
as much as the ones that you slip on I
don't know why but I think it's because
you can adjust how tight they are I
haven't had a chance to wear these yet
but I know they will come in handy i can
wear them with black skinny jeans or
blue jeans and probably with dresses and
skirts as oil i also needed to pick up
another pair of jeans and I've kind of
gone off my black Lee jeans a bit i'm
not sure why but the style just doesn't
really suit me at the moment and I've
got much more into Jamie jeans Jamie's
are more high-waisted and their thickest
they kind of suck you in more and I just
find them a little bit more flattering
with my body shape at the moment so I
picked up another pair of black Jamie
jeans and these are the ones with rips
in both knees I really like these
because you can weigh slightly shorter
tops with them and not show your belly
because the high waisted and I really
like the rips is just really kind of my
style annoyingly they don't do these in
jet black any more than you do the faded
black which is annoying if I wanted them
to be a bit smarter but I do quite like
the faded look as well and it goes with
the ribs I was really lacking tops I
have kind of jeans and trousers but
every time I go to put on a different
tapas pecially when I'm filming I would
think god I'm wearing the same top every
time I really don't have that many nice
top so I wanted to pick up some new
and the first one I saw was in topshop
it had this kind of black with white
dots print but it looks a bit kind of
Flint's Tony it's just a simple kind of
thin t-shirt and then it's got a
scalloped edge at the bottom which i
think is really nice these are tops are
just really easy to wear and it's
slightly shorter which means i can wear
it with my Jamie jeans and I look quite
cool I also spotted this shirt which I
thought was really nice and something a
little bit different it looks like this
and it has this kind of nice white with
black checked print on it I like that it
has a pocket and what I really like
about it is that it's shorter on the
front and longer on the back so if you
are wearing high waisted jeans it won't
kind of swallow me up it won't be so
huge it's kind of shorter on the front
but then the back is nice and long which
I like I'd like to kind of cover my bomb
I don't know why can wear it done up to
the top if you want a bit smarter or
sometimes I just undo the top button if
I want it a bit more casual I really
like this I feel like I'm gonna get a
lot of wear out of this okay so the next
shop I visited with Zara and I ever been
in twos are four months because I don't
really like Zara summer clothes but i
absolutely love their autumn winter
stuff and that's all started coming in
now so i went in to have a quick look
they do a lot of stuff with writing on
at the moment and i think it can be cool
I think sometimes it's a bit over the
top it completely depends what it says
but sometimes i really like it and i
really liked this gray t-shirt that I
spotted it was only 12 99 so I thought
I'd pick it up it's a gray t-shirt and
it says a jeans and tee kind of girl and
that's pretty much me I love wearing
jeans and t-shirts and I really like
this one so I'm happy I got that I think
it's really cute I think we're going to
see a lot of people were in this it's
just one of those t-shirts I also
spotted this one how much was this 1799
so it's still kind of affordable it's a
long sleeved white top and it has this
black band that goes across the front
and the back and it says Paris style
overview by fashion Insider kind of a
bit irrelevant what it says but I just
really like the style of it I think it
will be really nice layered with black
ripped jeans and a leather jacket on top
and it's just one of those kind of
useful things to have especially when
it's cold I can't always wear just t
shirt and leather jacket so it's nice to
have some long sleeved things but
sometimes jumpers are too hot so this is
perfect i think it will look really cool
and yeah i'm happy i found this I don't
ever get sent fashion stuff but wildfox
were kind enough to send me a top so i
thought i'd show you guys because i
really like it i think it's really nice
it's just a really thin white sweater
that's
it's slightly shorter and it says wild
on it and I love the quality of wild Fox
tops I think they're really good quality
and I think this is really cute it's an
extra small but it doesn't fit like an
extra small I'm normally a medium or
large so they obviously come up quite
big but I think that's nice as well and
it kind of goes with the other stuff
they bought their kind of black and
white layered theme final thing I bought
was from debenhams I had a voucher to
spend and I'm the sort of person who
always adds two vouchers I can never
find anything for the amount of the
voucher I always think oh but if i add
30 pounds i can get something really
nice I don't know why that's always my
way of thinking so I thought why waste a
voucher on something that I don't really
need and actually get a good pair of
shoes that I would wear a lot I had some
boots that I'm absolutely obsessed with
have become so scruffy I still wear them
but they are really scruffy they're not
black anymore they're like gray and my
other Hudson boots I love with the zip
at the back I'm just so uncomfortable I
can't bear to wear them so I wanted to
get another pair of boots and this time
I went for a flat pair and these are
from steve madden i have some sandals
from steve madden i really like so i
thought i'd try out some of his shoes
again they look like this they're kind
of chelsea boot style which i've never
been able to wear before because i
always find this part looks really big
on my foot but something about these
they look really nice they really go
with skinny black jeans they're kind of
a gray brownish color a bit different to
everything else I have I have a lot of
black boots I haven't really got any
kind of light bazy grey boots so I think
when get a lot of wear out of these I
got the size 6 in the end I'm definitely
six and a half these are a little bit
snug but the sevens just look so huge I
like a clown feet it's always the case
but I went for the six and the guy said
hopefully they're stretch so really
happy with these and looking forward to
wearing them in I'm going to wear them
tomorrow in the weekend so that's
everything for this whole I hope you
enjoyed seeing what I got and maybe
found some pieces that you want to pick
up as well I'm kind of now quite excited
for autumn/winter just because of the
clothes not because of the cold let me
know what sort of pieces you're getting
picking up as you go into autumn winter
and i'll see you guys in my next video
bye
