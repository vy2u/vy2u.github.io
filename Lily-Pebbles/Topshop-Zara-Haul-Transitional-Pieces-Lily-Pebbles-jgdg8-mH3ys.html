have seen that I got up to it a little
bit of shopping the web has completely
changed in the UK and I was waking up in
the mornings and just finding it really
hard to get dressed and that for me
means I need a bit of a wardrobe region
so I've taken some of my summer stuff
out and I kind of been putting in a few
transitional pieces and what I mean by
that is things that can take me from
summer to autumn there are a few bits
really missing in my wardrobe so I
picked up some stuff and I thought I'd
show you guys what I got this video
should come with a warning
there is absolutely no color in this
haul I'm sorry it's just the stuff I'm
into at the moment I'm really into
monochrome but I'm wearing color just to
make up for it it's a first of all
Topshop my favorite place to go for
clothes you just always have so much
stuff to pick from I was really missing
a certain type of shoot in my collection
I have boots I have sandals but I
haven't really got anything in-between
because I always find kind of the
brogues and the slip-on shoes really
uncomfortable and they really rub and I
just will never wear uncomfortable shoes
nothing is worth it but I saw these and
thought they would be perfect they're
black faux leather kind of pumps climp
soul type shoes I think that's what
they're called they have a white base
which makes them really kind of casual
but because they're black leather they
look a little bit smarter than your
normal plimsoll shoes they're lace-up so
they don't bump as much as the ones that
you slip on I don't know why but I think
it's because you can adjust how tight
they are I haven't had a chance to wear
these yet but I know they will come in
handy I can wear them with black skinny
jeans or blue jeans and probably with
dresses and skirts as well I also needed
to pick up another pair of jeans and
I've kind of gone off my Black Lee jeans
a bit I'm not sure why but the style
just doesn't really suit me at the
moment and I've got much more into Jamie
jeans Jamie's are more high-waisted and
they're thickest they kind of suck you
in more and I just find them a little
bit more flattering with my body shape
at the moment so I picked up another
pair of black Jamie jeans and these are
the ones with rips in both knees I
really like these because you can wear
slightly shorter tops with them and not
show your belly because they're
high-waisted and I really like the rips
it's just really kind of my style
annoyingly they don't do these in jet
black any more than you do the faded
black which is annoying if I wanted them
to be a bit smarter but I do quite like
the faded look as well and it goes with
the rips I was really lacking tops I
have kind of jeans and trousers but
every time I go to put on a different
top especially when I'm filming I always
think god I'm wearing the same top every
time I really don't have that many nice
so I wanted to pick up some new ones and
the first one I saw was in Topshop it
had this kind of black with white dots
print but it looks a bit kind of
Flintstone II it's just a simple kind of
thin t-shirt and then it's got a
scalloped edge at the bottom which i
think is really nice
these sort of tops are just really easy
to wear and it's slightly shorter which
means I can wear it with my Jamie jeans
and they look quite cool
I also spotted this shirt which I
thought was really nice and something a
little bit different it looks like this
and it has this kind of nice white with
black checked print on it I like that it
has a pocket and what I really like
about it is that it's shorter on the
front and longer on the back so if you
are wearing high-waisted jeans it won't
kind of swallow me up it won't be so
huge it's kind of shorter on the front
but then the back is nice and long which
I like I'd like to kind of cover my bum
I don't know why can wear it down up to
the top if you want it a bit smarter or
sometimes I just undo the top button if
I want it a bit more casual I really
like this I feel like I'm gonna get a
lot of wear out of this okay so the next
shot by visited was Zara and I ever been
into thought of her months because I
don't really like saris summer clothes
but I absolutely love their autumn
winter stuff and that's all started
coming in now so I went in to have a
quick look they do a lot of stuff with
writing on at the moment and I think it
can be cool I think sometimes it's a bit
over the top it completely depends what
it says but sometimes I really like it
and I really liked this gray t-shirt
that I spotted it was only $12.99 so I
thought I'd pick it up it's a grey
t-shirt and it says a jeans NT kind of
girl and that's pretty much me I love
wearing jeans and t-shirts and I really
like this one so I'm happy I got that I
think it's really cute I think we're
gonna see a lot of people were in this
it's just one of those t-shirts I also
spotted this one how much was this
$17.99 so it's still kind of affordable
it's a long-sleeved white top and it has
this black band that goes across the
front and the back and it says Paris
style overview by fashion insider kind
of a bit irrelevant what it says but I
just really liked the style of it I
think it'll be really nice layered with
black ripped jeans and a leather jacket
on top and it's just one of those kind
of useful things to have especially when
it's cold I can't always wear just
t-shirts and leather jacket so it's nice
to have some long sleeved things but
sometimes jumpers are too hot so this is
perfect I think it will look really cool
and yeah I'm happy I found this I don't
ever get sent fashion stuff but wild fox
were kind enough to send me a top so I
thought I'd show you guys because I
really like it I think it's really nice
it's just a really
thin white sweater that's kind of
slightly shorter and it says wild on it
and I love the quality of wild fox tops
I think they're really good quality and
I think this is really cute it's an
extra small but it doesn't fit like an
extra small I'm normally a medium or
large so they obviously come up quite
big but I think that's nice as well and
it kind of goes with the other stuff
they bought their kind of black and
white layered theme final thing I bought
was from Debenhams I had a voucher to
spend and I'm the sort of person who
always adds to that choose I can never
find anything for the amount of the
voucher I always think oh but if I add
30 pounds I can get something really
nice I don't know why that's always my
way of thinking so I thought why waste a
voucher on something that I don't really
need and actually get a good pair of
shoes that I would wear a lot if I had
some boots that I'm absolutely obsessed
with have become so scruffy I still wear
them but they are really scruffy they're
not black anymore they're like grey and
my other hudson boots that i love with
the zip at the back and just so
uncomfortable i can't bear to wear them
so i wanted to get another pair of boots
and this time I went for a flat pair and
these are from Steve Madden I have some
sandals from Steve Madden I really like
so I thought I'd try out some of his
shoes again they look like this they're
kind of Chelsea boot style which I've
never been able to wear before because I
always find this spot looks really fake
on my foot but something about these
they look really nice they really go
with skinny black jeans they're kind of
a grey brownish color a bit different to
everything else I have I have a lot of
black boots I haven't really got any
kind of light beige II gray boots so I
think wouldn't get a lot of wear out of
these I got the size 6 in the end I'm
definitely a six and a half these are a
little bit snug but the sevens just look
so huge I like a clown feet it's always
the case but I went for the six and the
guy said hopefully they're stretch so
really happy with these and looking
forward to wearing them in I'm going to
wear them tomorrow in the weekend so
that's everything for this haul I hope
you enjoyed seeing what I got and maybe
found some pieces that you want to pick
up as well I'm kind of now quite excited
for autumn winter just because of the
clothes not because of the cold let me
know what sort of pieces you're getting
picking up as you go into autumn winter
and I'll see you guys in my next video
