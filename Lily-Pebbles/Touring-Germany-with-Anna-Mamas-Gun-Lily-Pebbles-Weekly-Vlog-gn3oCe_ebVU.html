Oh Tessa Lane home garden oh it's off
when you guys could feel this it's when
you're in tonight Oh last night was the
sparkly number that me and I both save
you a bit jealous of this was amazing it

the early seventies and yeah it's all
hand-stitched sparkly make this
somewhere is my name as well that's so
cool yeah so if you're ever in Hong Kong
Nathan Road near the Mong Kok district
in Hong Kong I'm really jealous I want
everything yeah just having a little
Dave suitcase and the amazing ship I did
warn her about what Dave shirt that is
because they think Austin Powers I'm
just getting ready and we're in the
dressing room and has been put in charge
of fixing Dave's hat because this is his
special hat he puts on for one of the
songs it lights up and it fell off last
night so Anna is in charge of fixing it
now Anna's gonna try on Andy's jacket in
secret
she looks so stylish be careful oh my
god it's so nice oh that really suits
you cheap hotel okay quick put it back
for guns in this is going against
everything this trip is about good music
but will it is Celine Dion think twice I
love this song there'll be a storm too
now
we're saying that we should actually be
the moment songs backing singers home do
you like but like the low-key pretty
more people in it
it's like a bad neck so that's why they
were like okay we're gonna hit down
because some people started writing in
just early but it's a nice little gorge
and then we can hang in so that's a plan
for now
okay well packed up and finished and

there's pretty much five days so yes you
know a long one but we are all kind of
regrouping now and we're gonna head over
there's like a free festival happening
I'm in the center of Berlin and I've
heard it's like their equivalent of
Radio One's
festivals like their big radio station

look marks here too so welcome I have to
have the whole gang together

upside down and it has no end is amazing
who's posted that Anna always looking up

left the festival to kind of explore a
bit of the local area this is a
difference between the couples
rich is sitting on his phone with a beer
and I'm just like oh look a spa look at
these two on the Google Maps and got the
real map going on something out where to

am washing my hair definitely didn't
last the entire trip I'm gonna try and
quickly wash it so the hospital can go
out and grab a coffee I think today
we're gonna do a little like boat tour
of Berlin so that people who haven't
been kind of get a feel for it
but already me and rich have seen so
much more than when we came last time

didn't know what we were doing so I'm
really glad I'm back and I love it
we're gonna go on that what's afoot
again

drink with him in the hotel so I'm gonna
go back down and say hi and it's so nice
to see him because I lived with him in
uni and haven't seen at their ages and
then we're going to go to the gig and I
think it's gonna be a really fun one

hopefully we'll get to meet lots of you
guys and Mark and rich are gonna be
there with us too it's just so nice I am

friends with all the people who came by
themselves so that was really nice and
Mama's gonna on top form they did like
an extra-extra encore which was really
fun and my feet are killing me from

tired and tomorrow we're gonna have like
a little ice for day we're gonna do some
