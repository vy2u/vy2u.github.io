Tuesday morning but it's an exciting day
because today I'm going to New York I'm
going there with Urban Decay and a few
other blogging girls they're launching a
new product they wanted to take us out
there to show us the launch I think this
bloggers from work all over the world
going and I'm really really excited
following on from yesterday's video I
thought I would do a travel with me
style video there's not very much to
vlog today because I'm literally just
getting on a plane so this video
probably shorter than usual vlog but
it's more about my travel routine so
let's go back to last night where I
fancied getting at my camera and giving
you guys a little bit of an update
because I was feeling a little bit
anxious good evening guys it's Monday
night Bank Holiday Monday and tomorrow
morning very early in the morning I'm
heading to New York I was going to start
tomorrow but I'm feeling very nervous
tonight I'm feeling like a bit sad I'm
not gonna see rich for about a week and
just fading a lot but nervous to be away
from home I'm not traveling with Anna so
it's a little bit out of my comfort zone
and feeling a little bit kind of nervous
I've been packing all day I've literally
spent the entire day packing I've
completely over packed so I have all the
things I love with me when I'm away so
I'll see you in the morning and you can
come and kind of travel with me so I
didn't get much sleep last night maybe
about 5 hours it took me so long to fall
asleep I was tossing and turning I just
I just felt so nervous and like I had a
real homesick feeling I get very
homesick which so annoying I always have
but now I'm up this morning I'm really
excited I just said goodbye to rich it
was absolutely fine I'm so excited to
get the airport this isn't a usual
travel routine because we're actually
flying business class which I never fly
when I'm just going on like holiday with
rich or whoever so we're being
thoroughly spoiled and I would actually
say for those of you who are scared of
flying it does make massive difference
going in business class or first class
so definitely try and save up your air
miles like whether you fly a lot and you
need to save your Mars or get one of
those credit cards because you can
upgrade using air miles and it really
does make a difference so really looking
forward to going business class I'm
actually taking two suitcases which is a
bit excessive I thought I'd have some
space for some shopping I've already got
one large case so I'm taking two medium
cases instead so now I'm just waiting
for my taxi which is going to take me to
the airport
so at 8 o'clock and I'm in the airport
we were meant to meet at 8:30 so I'm
quite a bit early and I've actually
checked in I could have waited for the
whole group but it makes me feel much
more calm once I've checked in my bags
and everything sorted and I've got my
boarding pass so I've done that kind of
keep myself calm and actually to
everyone else to arrive
okay I'm in the lounge which is
obviously not something that I usually
do but I bought some porridge from CREP
because I haven't had breakfast so I'd
like to show you I got from Smiths which
I normally get to kind of make the
flight of an easier bottle of water big
bottle and then I bought like loads of
different magazines to keep you busy
I bought some snacks in case I get
hungry on the plane about popcorn some
of these fruit snacks and commercials
now it is wasting board
today we're lost
check in on the flight which made me a
little bit nervous I like people
organized enough but looking for
specificity my feet get into the line
I'm in the bathroom and as you get up
now
happiness
we high-five
turned out to be real
of how a couple but I'm gonna
after a very bumpy car ride in feeling
very carsick I'm here and the hotel is
beautiful I'll quickly give you guys
really quick tour of the room or staying
in the one hotel and it's so so pretty
this like a really nice window seat
their bed is nice really cute little
desk lots of like plant oh my god like a
marble shower beautiful like wooden
bathroom and it's all like open I'm
actually going to sign off this video
now we're going to Nobu to do that for
dinner tonight which would be really
nice but I kind of had enough of
vlogging today and I'm going to start
the New York vlogs properly tomorrow so
I'm going to be vlogging every day while
I'm here I'm seeing my friend Keisha
getting up - lots of fun stuff so I hope
you've enjoyed this like travel with me
style vlog and thanks for your comments
on yesterday's video or my like fear of
flying if you haven't seen it click the
I button I will link it below this video

you guys tomorrow
