for today's video I'm gonna be doing a
collective style haul so pieces I've
been buying from Topshop a sauce Urban
Outfitters over the past month or so
I've just been writing a list of
everything I've been buying and I
thought I'd put it into one big video
for you guys there's been a lot of stuff
along the way that I've taken back or
sent back I just feel a little bit lost
in my wardrobe at the moment I'm not
sure why but I'm definitely gonna get my
friend Deb's around to come and look at
my wardrobe and then take me shopping
cuz I feel really like I don't really
know where my style is at the moment but
I do want to experiment with different
things I'm just so bored of wearing
skinny jeans and a t-shirt or a jumper
pretty much every day so saying I have
bought a lot of new things recently and
I wanted to show you guys so all the
items I am talking about will be linked
down below in the description box so go
click down there to find the links if
the stuff is in stock I will link it I'm
gonna go through like the comfy
loungewear stuff first and you guys know
I work from home so I wear like at the
moment I'm wearing tracksuit bottoms in
a sweater that I wear like comfy clothes
a lot I love loungewear but also like
incorporating it into my outfits as well
if I can I like being casual so the
first couple things I bought from Urban
Outfitters and I love when a trend comes
back and fashion ad - was huge in the
90s I loved it then and I love it now
and Urban Outfitters is just full of
added s stuff at the moment I know some
people call it adidas or I don't know
but I call it a ddos apologies both of
these really need a wash i just been
wearing them so much but i wanted to
show you anyway I got the black t-shirt
with the white adidas logo and I got the
white one with the black logo they're
both different styles the white one is
actually a men's t-shirt so it's a bit
more like a standard t-shirt Fitbit
loose I got it in size small and then
the black one is the women's one so it's
a bit thinner and material a bit more
fitted and I got this in 10 so they fit
slightly different both are so so comfy
I love wearing them with jeans and
trainers on the weekend I've literally
been wearing both of these to death they
really need a wash but I'm enjoying kind
of working sportswear back into my
wardrobe I also picked up a couple of
tracksuit bottoms from Topshop they
literally do the best tracksuit bottoms
there
so soft and comfortable I live in them
you're definitely gonna set the pattern
in this hole that I'm somewhere in
between a size 10 and a 12 and it's so
frustrating I never know what I'm gonna
be so when I'm ordering online it's so
hard I'm definitely a size 11 if it's
size 11 existed that would be me so I
got one in a size 10 and one in a size
12 and I kind of wear them for different
things so these ones I got in a size 10
they're like a really nice light gray
kind of oatmeal color really soft and
they're slightly tighter so I wear these
more like pajamas and even in when I'm
at home I think they can look a little
bit like white company s when you wear
them with like a nice zip pop they're
just so soft and comfortable I app so
you love these and then I got these ones
in a 12 so I can wear these outside on't
really wear traps it wasn't out there
I'm like running errands or running to
the shop they don't look like pajamas
they look like tracksuit bottoms and I
really love the pattern there is a
matching jumper to go with these I
didn't get it but they're gray with a
white and black panel down the side and
they go tight on the ankle they're
really nice and thick these ones so soft
inside so so comfy I absolutely love
these I've been wearing them like every
day I'm also wearing a dark grey of
Topshop tracksuit bottoms now that my
mom bought me for my birthday I
literally live in loungewear so what
else did I get from Topshop I also
bought this which is a little bit like
I'm still not sure if I love it or not
but I like that it's a bit different my
wardrobe literally consists of black
white and cobalt blue I love that kind
of bright blue color so I'm just trying
to at the bottom so this is a white
shirt with big blue polka dots on it's
kind of like a blue and grey polka dot
the shape is like a t-shirt shape which
I think makes it look a little bit like
hospital hospital robes you know like
what the doctors wear but I like that
it's long and loose so I can wear it
with skinny jeans it's got a nice collar
and it's also got a little cutout at the
back at the top as well I like the
pattern I think it will look nice
layered under a jacket under a blazer so
that's nice this I haven't taken the
label off yet which isn't a good sign
that means I should probably take it
back but I just always like to have some
good dresses to hand in case I get
invited to an event where I need a dress
and I always freak out that I haven't
got anything to wear and I tried this on
and thought actually this could be quite
good too
I'm still not sure if the shape suits me
I'm so used to wearing like oversized
things that when I wear fitted clothes I
just feel so uncomfortable but I think
this is nice
I'm not sure I really like the pattern
it's like a checked blue white and black
pattern so that's what dresses black but
the stripes are blue and white it's got
slightly longer tee shirt sleeves that
are tight and then it goes out in I
don't know what the shape of this sort
of dress is called it's quite tight
around my boob area yeah I went for a 10
in the end cuz the 12 I think was a
little bit too big or just didn't kind
of fit right in places but the temples a
little bit too small but I like but it's
like thick material really like - sucks
you in I don't know what I'd wear it
with I feel like maybe it's a little bit
too young for me the kind of skater
style let me know what you think because
I think I can still take it back I'm not
sure I still got the label on I can't
really remember when I bought it but let
me know what you guys think how much was
this 42 pounds it's not cheap I think if
I kept it I would wear it but it's maybe
not the nicest dress that I own also
from Topshop I absolutely love this this
is probably one of my favorite purchases
I can't believe bomber jackets are back
in when I was about maybe eight or nine
I used to wear a black shiny bomber -
coat and I had a coat black shiny bomber
to school and I had an orange lining me
and all my friends had one we loved it
it was cool then and I can't believe
it's come back in fashion like I'm
getting to that age now where I've like
seen fashion trends come back
it's literally 20 years later the bomber
is back I love it I did kind of shop
around to find one that suits me it's a
hard shape to pull off I've got long
legs and a short torso so I shouldn't
really wear like short jackets because
it just makes my torso look really small
but I really like it I love this got
like no collar I was trying to find one
with a gold zip I couldn't find one
anywhere but the whomping Topshop has a
kind of silver zip that looks a little
bit gold it's just a really standard
bomber and I really like wearing it on
like casual days with jeans with a D -
t-shirt looks really cool and I've been
wearing this a lot since I got it I like
to roll the sleeves up as well so I'm
very happy that bombers are back in
another dress that I picked up was for
my best friend's wedding I did actually
have a dress from needle and thread
which I still like and I've kept it for
other
but I found that the arms for some
reason when I lifted my arm it was so
tight here that I felt like it was gonna
break and I knew that I would be dancing
like a maniac at my friend's wedding so
I've kept that dress for events where
I'm not dancing like a maniac and
instead I got this dress from whistles I
think I got it via a sauce I love that a
sauce cell whistles because I am an Asus
premier customer if you don't have a sus
premier seriously it's the best thing so
this is the dress it's navy blue and it
has this like sheer panel at the back at
the top all this amazing detail like
lace floral detail this pattern down the
middle at the front a nice kind of belt
thing in the middle that like cinches in
your waist and then it's quite long
which is a bit different for me and it's
got another sheer panel at the bottom
and pretty lace just under the knee I
mean there's a lot going on in this
dress I feel like the camera won't make
it look nice but I promise in real life
it look nice I got so many compliments
on I wore this dress
it's sleeveless so I could to throw my
arms in the air and dance like crazy and
it just felt really comfortable to wear
I wore it some little black strappy
shoes okay I've got a few more things
from ASOS but just to break it up I'm
gonna throw in a couple of accessories
now I picked up these earrings from
aralia I got them via a sauce and I'm
trying to build up my earrings
collection you guys know I've got like
five piercings now in my ears and no
nice earrings so whenever I see anything
I like I pick them up as long as they're
not too expensive these are from aralia
which is a really nice brand they also
sell it in Topshop and I think the yet
star earring that I've got is from there
so these are like little mint blue
stones have a her gold hexagons around
them that's probably the easiest way to
describe they're quite baked for what I
would like to put in my ears but I think
for like a special earring for special
occasions I think they're really nice my
favorite color I love that it's gold and
I think they're really pretty so I'm
glad I got those this one I know is
gonna split people's opinions I put on
snapchat most of you guys said yes keep
the Hat some of you guys said no to the
cap I don't know I don't really know
when I'll wear this but I struggle to
wear like big hats I just feel so like
show off and over the top
but I like having a hat for like greasy
hair days or just something a bit
different I think I do suit hats I just
have like a hat
my mom always says that like they're so
lucky that you suit house but I never
wear them so to go with the whole like
sports theme I thought I'd pick up a cap
I actually wanted one that had this in
black but I saw this on ASOS and just
threw it in the basket last minute to
try it out so let me know what you guys
think I think I'll probably keep it I
think I'm gonna keep this it wasn't that
expensive and I feel like for casual
days let's put it on I don't know can I
get away with it I think I look a bit
like some kind of weird mom who's taking
their child to football I don't know I
think it very much depends on what I'm
wearing I'm not gonna ruin my hair now
put myself hat hair but I think it's
nice to have the option just in case of
fancy wearing a cap okay what else have
I got here this top so I saw this on
ASOS and it's a code so it's like a
matching top and bottoms and I don't
know why but the models always look
amazing in these and I always fall for
it and I order it now I put it on and I
just look like me in my pajamas so it
didn't work out with the trousers and I
decided that I still really liked the
print and the trousers maybe weren't the
most flattering even though they were
very comfortable because they were like
joggers but I like the top so I kept the
top and sent the trousers back it's a
very thin material it's kind of stretchy
blue with this like white lace floral
pattern on is high-neck which doesn't
usually suit me because I have slightly
bigger boobs but I kind of like the high
neck thing so I feel like I can make it
work and when I wore this with my like
grey loose charles's I think it looked
quite cool I think it's a little bit
different with a red lip it would look
nice and with a jacket on top I just
want to have the option for something a
little bit different and it doesn't say
how much it is this is from the a soft
white range I really like the Asus white
stuff so yeah it's kind of boxy short I
got this in the 12 so it's slightly
bigger but I like it I always like to
have lots of top options so I also got
this t-shirt from the a sauce white
range and it's a really nice thin white
t-shirt that has this like gray pattern
down the side and down the back and down
the front the back kind of stops where a
normal t-shirt would at the front it
goes longer and kind of pointy to one
side and very bad at explaining these
kind of things but it just look really
nice in the model and luckily it suited
me too I really
it's something a bit different rather
than wearing just a plain white t-shirt
because it's slightly longer at flatters
and makes my torso look longer so really
happy with that t-shirt and now this
jumper I'm still not sure what to do
about this I think by the time you guys
watch this I would have made a decision
but like again I had that whole like
1012 issue it's part of the tool a sauce
range so I knew it'd be slightly longer
than normal which is fine and 5/7 so I
guess that classes me as tall I'm not
really sure but I went for the 12 in the
end and it's a little bit big for me but
I do like oversized clothes so basically
going really wanted another high neck
jumper so this is high notes not like
too high you have to roll it over it's
just a little high neck it's gray it's
got slightly like back wind arms I think
that's what it's called I've rolled up
the sleeves and then it goes quite long
and splits at the side I do think it's
slightly too baggy for me I think the 10
would have looked nice but it's just a
risk that I always have to kind of weigh
out when I'm ordering clothes
I can't reward send us back because I do
like it oversized as well I do like high
next tops at the moment okay finally
onto jeans I usually buy my jeans from
Topshop they're 40 pounds and I normally
go for the Jamie skinny jeans but all I
really wear our skinny jeans and I
always want to try something different
but whenever I try on like the Topshop
mom jeans or anything like that they're
so unflattering they look terrible on me
so I thought maybe I have to invest to
get a better shape jeans maybe I have to
invest which is fine I was thinking I
could spend like up to a hundred pounds
and jeans so I went to the Selfridges
like denim floor with rich on the
weekend and tried it on like 25 pairs of
jeans first of all I was quite surprised
they were like 270 pounds which I know I
wear jeans a lot but jeans aren't a
particularly exciting purchase and spend
two hundred and seventy thousand on
jeans was a bit like I thought if
they're amazing like maybe I can but I
try one like 25 pairs and none of them
were that amazing I really struggle to
find like a boyfriend fit that weren't
really really short and cropped and most
of the jeans were just skinny so I was
really disappointed with the kind of
options out there and I went a sauce and
saw these and actually I was really
happy when they came that they I think
they look quite good it's just nice to
have a different
when I don't want to wear skinny jeans
so these are the I caught remember what
they're called I'll link them down below
there are light denim wash and they've
got rips up here and rips on the knees
and a bit of like paint splatter as well
which is a bit tacky but you can't
really notice it and they're slightly
rolled up at the bottom and they're a
little bit more like mid rise and I mean
you see our jeans quite high-rise
because my tummy is my like area that I
want to cover so I feel like it kind of
sucks it all in with these it kind of
works and it looks nice with the t-shirt
and they're really comfortable and I'm
really glad that I found something that
fit me so that was my Jean struggle let
me know where you buy your jeans from
because I never know where to go I tried
on like seven mankind or whatever it's
called and Hudson and J Brand and even
though they were really expensive there
I just didn't think they fit that well
so cheap and cheerful and just what I
needed if you guys haven't yet seen in

vlog kind of put into one video so I
