am gonna be turning 28 it's my birthday
and I wanted to do some kind of video
for my birthday this year but I'm not
really doing anything so I couldn't do
like a get ready with me so I was trying
to think for ages this is like months
ago trying to think what to do and I
thought it might be quite a nice idea
soon as I'm turning 28 to think of 28
great things that have happened this
year there's quite a lot of great things
but actually it wasn't as hard as I
thought it's obviously been some
not-so-great things as well but I
thought it's her birthday let's do an
uplifting video and so I'm going to talk
you through 28 great things that have
happened in the last year I went to
Disney in Florida right at the beginning
of the year and I knew it was gonna be
fun because Disney's always fun but I
made such good friends on that ship
here's Lydia and then John and Leon are
over there we actually had the best time
I feel like we were there for so long we
made such good friends over such a short
period of time and I feel like I'll
always look back and remember that
it was incredible Anna and I started
Arby's chat live UK tour it was the
first time we've done anything like that
and we just literally had no idea what
to expect right well on our way to
brighter these all the goody bags for
you guys Anna's licking our little sign
in q4 there's a homecoming tour we were
both so overwhelmed it's so nice to meet
you guys
I can't even explain it's just like
meeting friends that we've had forever
but never really met it's like having a
pen pal and we did it with spacing K and
it was just a huge success like in all
different ways everyone it was a success
for everyone I feel like it really
started off the year really well and I
felt really proud of me and I know after
that I had the opportunity of having a
photo shoot with and ranking this was
for a very exclusive job it was a really
fun day like how do these things even
happen I don't know but I had my photo
taken by Rankine I don't think I've ever
really been on a proper photo shoot
before then so it was a really good
experience and it's really nice to have
fighters to keep and my mum and Grandma
I loved them and it was a great day I
did a job with Burberry which is a job I
always kind of look back on and talk
about whenever I do conferences or talks
of Google just because it's a really
good example of a good sponsored job I
know it we talk about things like this
on here very often but I think was a
good example because it was a brand I
really liked and sort of look that I did
something really wearable that you guys
could relate to there was a bit of
behind-the-scenes and I just got a
really good feedback from you guys which
is the most important thing I enjoyed it
Burberry were really happy with the
outcome and yes it's one of those jobs
always look back on and think that was a
really good one this morning I went to
Burger HQ based on here I'm really early
but it looks incredible surfing
breathes here so that's the makeup look
for the Burberry autumn/winter 15 show
and I hope I did Wendy proud I did my
best
my friend Keisha became the model for
the white company and her face was
plastered all over the stores in the
catalog on like billboards that
literally saw her everywhere I think she
even went to do the autumn/winter
campaign as well but that was just a
really proud moment for me just cuz it
so like visuals see her face everywhere
in a shop that everyone goes into all
the time I go into all the time
literally anything every white company's
shop I went into I told them that she
was my friend they were like okay I
don't care I relaunched my blog I had a
whole blog redesigned my friend Jay did
it I'll link his website down below five
minutes till the vlog goes live right
say I J I'm gonna click Save Changes
which makes it happen
Frankie May you were the first person on
Twitter to notice the new website Thank
You tears I really wanted to have like a
grid system with different grids we
worked for so long on it and I was
really fussy of what I wanted I was so
happy with the outcome and I remember
that wasn't my friend James flat and we
were waiting for like the countdown of
the blog to launch and I was so nervous
and it got such good feedback and I'm
still really happy with the design I
knew it would be the sort of design that
could like just live on and I won't need
updating every year like I'm still
completely happy with it my beautiful
beautiful grandma turned 85 I can't
believe I was insert photos of her here
I can't believe she's 85 she looks
incredible I love her so so much she's
the only grandpa I have left and she
means a lot to me and it was really nice
to celebrate her 85th birthday I went to
Paris with Chanel me and Anna both when
we're in hotel cost it's absolutely
incredible
in Coco Chanel's department this is
insane that was a dream come true like
even speaking to Chanel it's completely
crazy but being invited to Paris on a
trip with them and we got to look at
Coco Chanel's apartment and hear the
stories about Coco Chanel and it was a
really special experience that I'll
never forget I'm so glad that I've loved
these things and take photos because I
just know what I'm old and gray and I
tell my grandchildren that sure
l took me to Paris they're just gonna
think I'm lying I'm very lucky I created
a video called a day in the life and
it's nothing that's special but for me
it was kind of a moment of a new kind of
video and I experimented a bit with just
a different idea that I hadn't really
seen before in a different way of
editing and that really inspired me to
try and do more creative videos when I
have the time to I got really good
feedback from it and it just gave me a
good boost of confidence
I feel like changed my video style
slightly towards the second half of the
year I went back to Paris again and this
time I got to meet Lisa Eldridge who's a
makeup artist that I've always looked up
to I watched on TV when she did ten
years younger and then I obviously
became obsessed with her YouTube channel
and she was really lovely and it was
great to meet her have you just met the
hotel and it was so nice to meet these
others just one of those experiences
again that I can't really believe
happened in May I created everyday May
where I've logged every day I hadn't
done it since vlogmas
and I feel like what I blog every day
you guys get to know me so much better I
can really put my real personality out
there which sometimes is not a good
thing because sometimes like everyone
I'll say something stupid and then get
loads of hate for it but it's also a
really great thing and I felt like I got
to know you guys better you got to know
me better and it was really fun I'll
just always remember May for every day
made my best friend Gemma got engaged
and it was emotional she phoned us I
think half past 12:00 at night to tell
us and because a few weeks ago we'd kind
of fooled our friend pretending they got
engaged as a joke so I kind of thought
she was joking but then when I realized
she wasn't
I bawled I was embedded with rich and I
was crying my eyes out there's something
very special about your best friend
getting engaged I was just so happy for
her so excited and I'll never forget
that evening when she phoned me actually
thought she phoned me because she got
mugged I don't know why but why would
she phoned me I like half 12:00 at night
I was like oh my god Gemma's got mugged
sheshe wasn't mom she was engaged which
is far more exciting Anna and I went to
LA for VidCon and B chat live we're
finally in LA after what felt like an
entire day of traveling so VidCon was
like mental I've just finished my
and it was actually much better than I
thought I spoke it felt really good to
be there be quite involved with the
YouTube community and then we did our
first speech chat live in America we
thought no one would come
loads of people came and there is really
different just when you meet people
around the world everyone so different
we hadn't really done anything in
America before everyone's so friendly
and chassis it was quite an emotional
one as well but really good experience
I loved that trip to LA what our best
friends Keisha actually lives in Jamaica
so I don't get to see her that much
which is really sad because we kind of
grew up together and saw each other all
the time but when she comes home it's
always so nice to catch up and she came
home like halfway through the year
Menke showing a couple of other friends
went out and it wasn't intentional but
we got some drunk we went into karaoke
and it was like the best night ever
I I mean I'm not encouraging you to get
drunk I don't do it that often oh my god
officer Jones but we had so much fun I
was like crying and laughing we've seen
sad songs and happy songs I definitely
recommend karaoke for like an emotional
reunion night it was so good don't drink
a whole bottle of wine to yourself there
Richard I bought our first piece of art
in France which is really exciting we
didn't even have our new place yet but I
just knew that I wanted to have a
special bit of art when we moved into a
new place and I found it in the South of
France in old Antibes it's fine art is
called hallowed bear I didn't how you
pronounce it but it's like beautiful
washes of blue it looks like a girl
standing in the sea I find it really
relaxing it really goes with like the
color scheme of our lounge and I love it
my parents celebrated their 40th wedding
anniversary which is amazing so many
people unfortunately their parents
aren't still together and I feel really
lucky that mine are 40 years that's
really really long and really impressive
so I hope I have a marriage as good as
theirs I reached 300,000 subscribers
obviously it's not all about numbers and
today I think when I reach 300
subscribers I was three hundred thousand
subscribers I was really really excited
and since then I've kind of got less
fussed about numbers I've realized that
actually the quality of my audience is
what my priority is that's what's really
important to me but obviously it's still
really nice to reach milestones every
now and again and never ever thought I
could have as many subscribers and
viewers as I do now so thank you the
next one is a strange one because it's
kind of a sad thing but also a great
thing Anna
moved back to Brighton and I'm not gonna
lie I was quite shocked when she told me
and I was really sad because I never
thought in my wildest dreams that in my
late twenties I would make a new best
friend and I was really worried when she
said she'd moved that we wouldn't be as
close and I wouldn't get to see her but
she is so happy now living in Brighton
and that is the most important thing and
it's been so nice to see her be so happy
and we get to see each other all the
time still so it's great so Anna moving
poison is definitely a great thing that
happened in the last year me and rich
spent the weekend it wasn't as festival
together Neal's Yard took us and it was
so so good we are at Wilderness Festival
this weekend and we are staying in one
of these amazing tents I think it was
like a few weeks for rich proposed to me
which is why I feel like I had quite
good memories of it because I could
definitely now looking back I can see
that his attitude was different he was
very like because very light loving and
I don't know it was really nice it was a
nice weekend that we spent together and
it was an amazing festival I really want
to go back with all my friends the
setting the place where it was with like
the lake and it was all really like
earthy and gluten-free and I loved it I
really really had a great weekend we've
got our flats me and rich finally got a
flat together and it's so nice it's been
lovely to just decorate it and fill it
with things that we both love my hands
absolutely covered in paint and my face
I think and I'm so happy here I really
thought that I was gonna be mega
homesick because I'm a homesick person
but I wasn't which means that it's kind
of right as the right time it was the
right place and it was with the right
person
looking deep here me and rich got
engaged which is mad rich awesome
I've always asked me like did you know
what's gonna happen was it surprise
obviously I knew we were gonna get
engaged we've been together for like
nearly eight years now but I genuinely
thought because we like just moved out I
thought he'd wait till like
Christmastime but I think he actually
was going to and then timings got all
messed up I was really shocked because
it was like a random day if you've
watched the vlog you'll know that we
went like mattress shopping in the
morning which is really funny because I
tweeted this photo and look at Richard
space clearly he has something to hide
and I had no idea but it all felt very
normal we just had a barbecues friends
to celebrate and now I get to planning
our wedding which is mad I swear I feel
like I'm about 19 Ana and I went to
Germany on tour with my friends band
Mama's gun and it was just something
really different we thought why not let
us experiment maybe we don't always have
to do beauty shops when we do meetups
like maybe our viewers like more than
just beauty I know you guys do you like
music you like lifestyle home def course
so we thought let's try you know invite
people to a gig and if they want to come
they can if they don't they don't it was
a very kind of casual thing and it
worked so well so many of you guys came
out we went to Berlin Frankfurt I have
no idea where we went I can't remember
but my memory is so bad but I know that
a lot of you guys came and we were just
like dancing and I get together and it
was great and it was just something a
bit different so that was amazing there
were so many of you guys in because that
was a really fun time my university
which is Birmingham City University
contacted me and asked if they could put
a photo and quote of me on the wall like
what the actual health I'm not even
joking
I failed school I didn't get one A in my
GCSEs or a-levels or a s levels my
teachers laughed at me when I said I
wants to go to university I didn't
actually even get the grades I needed to
get into uni but I think my personal
statement was quite good so I got in and
then I worked my ass off I got it first
and now I've ended up like I hate saying
this because I'm so English and my
English people don't like to show off at
all but I'm quite successful and my
university want to put me on their wall
I mean it's just mental I can't really
get my head around
at all but I'm completely flattered and
loads of people from BC you often tweet
me like I can see you on the wall and
it's it's amazing I've never been a star
student so I feel honored and very
embarrassed about it as well my parents
got a new puppy a lot of you ask Juneau
is mine and riches poppy or my parents
my parents coffee I've grown up with
dogs which has just made me not want a
dog because I know how much
responsibility they are but she is so
cute their little Tibetan Terrier she's
still in the puppy phase and we're
trying to change they're trying to not
chained her we're trying to train her
she she has like this mad hour in the
evening where she just like bites your
feet and it hurts - death is so painful
but she's really cute and my parents are
very happy with her one of my really
good friends Rob turned 30 this year and
me and my friends went to Daylesford
farm to surprise him for the weekend
we're here we're gonna leave all our
cases in the car we had such a nice
weekend he had no idea we were coming we
like snuck in and surprised him and then
had such a relaxing weekend we had like
a yoga class we ate amazing food played
games it's just one of my favourite
things to be just surrounded by friends
relaxing and celebrating big birthdays
how are my friends turning 30 what is
going on I still haven't decided how
much of this wedding stuff I'm gonna
share or not it's likely to be after the
wedding that I'll end up sharing
everything and saying what happened
because then it's done there's something
a bit weird about sharing details before
the actual wedding but I will tell you
that the next great thing that happened
in the last year is that I found my
wedding dress who knew I was so relaxed
I really struggled to find the right
shops that had like casual stuff that I
liked but I found a few and the first
shop I went into pretty much first dress
I tried on and I was like yeah that's
great which is so exciting so that's one
thing ticked off the wedding list I was
in stylus magazine recently and I had
like a whole page the shoot was mad when
I turned up the girl said okay so I've
been told to just cover you in oil and
makes you really shiny and I was like
Lily don't be a diva don't be a diva but
I was like I'm I'm a beauty blogger
surely if I'm shiny I'm just gonna get
so many tweets being like
you look shiny but then she said no
you're meant to look like a mannequin
you're meant to look plastic cause like
it wolf the other girls all doing it I
can't not do I look ridiculous so I just
like let's go along with it put some
trust in the photographer and it turned
out so well it literally looked like a
plastic bulb you had to like pose like
this and I thought I was really happy
with the shoot and it was really
exciting I love being in like relevant
magazines like stylist that really
appeals to like me and I get tweets from
people and my friends and family see it
and it's nice to have like something to
look at and to hold and the final thing
is is that my oldest sister Carly is
pregnant we found out recently and it's
so exciting I can't wait to have them
the little baby in the family you know
what it's scary because when my sister's
had babies before I'd never changed
nappies I was like I'll just do the cute
stuff you guys can do the poo but this
one I feel like I need to practice
because you know in the next few years
that's a lie
so not gonna be the next few years it
may be the next like five years I'm
probably gonna have a baby and I need to
like practice this whole nappy changing
malarkey so this baby I'm calling it
practice baby and I'm gonna have to like
get stuck in and it's gonna stink I'm so
excited
another little baby in the family I
can't wait so those are 28 great things
that happen this year and I hope you
guys like this video
I really enjoyed thinking of all the
happy memories that have happened over
the last year I can't believe I'm gonna
be 28 but it's happening I need to just
embrace it so thank you so much for
watching I hope you guys are enjoying
vlogmas so far and i will see you
tomorrow for another vlog bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
