Tuesday I thought I would do a midweek
vlog for you today
I'm home this morning and I'm in town
this afternoon okay let me put my tea
down today's video is actually sponsored
by Revlon and you guys know I've been
working with them for the past twelve
months thank you so much for all of your
support on the instagrams and the videos
I've been doing with them but today
finally we can get excited for Christmas
and they have a really cool deal coming
up so I really wanted to tell you guys
it's early as possible so you don't
forget if you head into boots in the
run-up to Christmas and to spend over 15
pounds on Revlon products you can get a
free festive gift box which is their
Christmas gift of purchase this is what
it looks like it is very cool it's worth
over 30 pounds it's very easy to spend
over 15 pounds on Revlon products I've
recommended so many products in my
videos in the past so if you find
yourself in Boots buying a couple of
things you can just spend that little
bit extra more and you get a free gift
purchase you can either gift it to
yourself or gift it to a friend or
family member I'm gonna show you today
in this video what is inside the festive
gift box and kind of talk you through
each product so let me do like a little
unboxing it shows all the products on
the back and what each of them do which
is really handy okay I'm gonna open it
up okay the first thing I'm gonna dig
out this is the Revlon Ultra Volume
Mascara in blackest black I love my
black mascara this one is really good
especially as we're coming up to
Christmas party season this will give
you really like full black long luscious
lashes luscious lashes that's hard to
say I really like the brush on this
mascara it's big and fluffy and I find
this works best on my lashes I think if
you want more kind of precise long
lashes than a plasticy wand is better
but this one is great for like full
fluttery lashes which is perfect for
this time of year so you get a full-size
mascara in there which i think is great
okay what else there are two lip
products the first one is the Revlon
Colorstay lip liner in natural this is
so good I think everyone needs like a
natural lip liner in their handbag it
helps when you're wearing nude lipsticks
you can just define your lip shape more
for me I haven't got much of a Cupid's
bow so it's really helpful to use the
lip liner just to kind of draw that in a
little bit you can use this just as a
liner or just all over the lips
really kind of natural lipstick look
this is a really good one because you
don't need a sharpener it just kind of
twists up and it's very soft and easy to
use that is also full size and then the
next product again full size you get so
many amazing things in here this is the
Revlon Ultra HD matte lip color and this
is in the shade seduction this is my
favorite out everything you get in the
box I'm wearing it now I absolutely love
these the formula is like a really soft
velvety matte formula it's very easy to
apply especially with the dopher
applicator it's like really long and it
just kind of hugs your lips it's very
soft easy to apply and I really like the
shade as well it's kind of like a peachy
nude
it doesn't feel drying at all on the
lips it stays put it doesn't kind of rub
off but then it doesn't feel hard and
dry and it feels really comfortable like
I can hardly feel it on the lips so that
is a really cool product and then
finally this is one of their nail
enamels and this is in the shade creme
brulee there are a couple of shades so
you can't guarantee which one you're
going to get but this is one of the
shades that you might get in your
festive gift box and it's a really
pretty kind of rose gold I think this
would look nice all over the nail but I
also think this would really nice just
kind of dotted on the nail if you wear
like a dark navy or dark burgundy nail
polish all over your nails and then
using like a daughter or a toothpick or
anything you have like that I like to
but if now polish on some foil and then
use the daughter just to put like one
dot on each nail and I think that looks
really really chic you could also just
do it on plain nails I think that would
look really nice as well so that is
everything you get in the Revlon festive
gift box don't forget this deal is
exclusive to boots in the run-up to
Christmas you have to spend over 15
pounds on Revlon products and then you
get the gift box which is worth over 30
pounds I'm going to put all the details
in the description box along with more
info on each of the products that you're
going to get in the box so definitely go
check out all the information below I
think that's a really nice Christmas
treat okay what do I have planned for
the rest of the day I need to do some
work this morning and then I need to
head into town it looks like a nice like
wintry day today I'm gonna put my coat
on actually really need to buy scarf
because it is getting colder so I might
pick up a scarf somewhere I need to take
a jump back to Topshop and then I'm
going for a meaty and that gleam I think
that's about it and then I had to pick
up some food for dinner on the way
so you guys can come along with me for
the day this is like the biggest cup of
tea ever skinned Sydney ages to get
through it
as you may have noticed just to point
out the obvious I am in our old flat and
that's because I filmed this just before
you moved you would have seen in my last
video that we have moved very exciting
but right now as I'm filming this we
haven't so we're still here for now I
love this place this is how we're
currently living with our bedroom
loads of flat pack boxes not such a
pleasant sight to wake up to in the
morning I did an online Topshop order
which you would have seen in my whole
video but this jumper came in it's got
like a bit of a black mark on it it's
not huge so I wasn't sure whether like
bother but you can see it when you wear
it so I'm gonna try and change that for
another one hopefully they have them in
stock in store so I'm gonna put this in
a little tote bag I'm just pretty comfy
today this is my cashmere jump from a
weekday which I love and underneath I'm
wearing this t-shirt which copperfield
gave me look how funny it's got
embroidered hearts on the boobs it's
from a brand called delicious monster I
think I think it was like um specially
done for copper feel it's when I did the
festive feel I was on a panel and it was
in like a goody bag which is really nice
I'm wearing skinny jeans which I haven't
went skinny jeans and ages but I felt
did it because I put on my boots for the
first time this year very exciting I
think I'm gonna put on some jewelry as
well my large horn necklace I don't know
if it's my soma or missamma I hear
people say both to me my soma sounds
better but it might just be missamma
okay horn maybe I'll put on the shorter
one as well I'm gonna wear my Topshop
checked coats which I am loving
absolutely loving this at the moment
okay I'm ready to go I'm gonna head into
town spend your time I get there gonna
try get some stuff done before my
meeting
I'm in town I really want one of these
hats I don't know if they suit me I feel
like my friends
I really like them I absolutely love
this blush pink velvet jacket and
trowsers see it hot my size I'm just
heading in scribbler because I've got
loads of cards I need to buy a
thoroughly unsuccessful only got one
card I'm gonna head see Liberty and see
if they've got any more in there look
the Christmas lights are four knots of
circus
everything is just getting super
Christmasy I'm always so obsessed with
the floral display outside Liberty it's
so Percy look at these colors I like
that is okay I'm gonna see if the pony
cards in here thank you
I've got about 20 minutes guess I'm
eating so I just picked up the Leon fish
finger wrap I'm gonna use it on my way
okay I'm leaving gleam on face I try to
do some work but I feel like I'll get
more done at home so I'm heading home
with things from my peer box oh I just
got home it's so nice to come home when
it like gets dark it's quarter to five
and I'm gonna get into my comfy clothes
and then I'm gonna sit and finish with
my work because I couldn't really
concentrate in the office sometimes I
find it really helpful to work there
because I'm in like work mode and then
sometimes I find it really distracting
and today was just one of those days so
I'm gonna do some work here tonight I'm
so happy I picked up that hat because
I've been looking for one of those
everywhere but they're either too big
too small they just look where they're
too high and that one I think is the
perfect one so I'm gonna try it on for
rich I feel like he's just gonna laugh
at me but we'll see I think I'm gonna
leave this vlog here we're gonna make
some spaghetti with cherry tomatoes and
porns for dinner and then we're just
gonna watch some TV I hope you guys
