now today's video was meant to be a vlog
I actually tried to vlog on Wednesday
and failed miserably because it was so
pouring with rain it was absolutely
soaking wet that I just it was really
difficult to vlog I think when you're
walking around town and it's pouring
with rain and you haven't got enough
hands to hold your umbrella and you're
vlogging camera it ended up just not
working so I quit on that day I think
this is gonna be the rainiest day ever
and then I tried to vlog again on
Thursday which is kind of a working from
home day and halfway through the day I
just realized that I just really had
nothing to vlog and it was really boring
and I didn't want to put boring video
out there just for the sake of vlogging
my Internet's been super slow today
which is fun but I've just managed to
upload the video for Sunday and now I'm
gonna do the description box so then I
wasn't gonna do a video and I thought
well I'm at my parents hence why there's
a collection of random things behind me
like guitars and baby car seats and
pianos and things I'm at my parents
house right now and this is where all my
kind of bloggers mail gets sent when I
get sent here and to my agent because I
just a dream and my flat for any kind of
deliveries so I was going through all of
my post I've been here for a couple of
weeks and I thought well I could just
film this it's not like a planned
throughout video I don't know how
interesting it is but it's better than
nothing and I know you guys like to see
kind of what I get sent as I always like
to remind you I don't ask for any of
these things it's a very it's definitely
like a perk of the job I'm very lucky
but today it's not a favorites video it
suggests let me show you what I've been
sent and I really haven't looked at any
of this stuff yet so I'm just gonna go
through it and show you guys what some
parents dining-table I also have a very
little makeup on and I'm sitting right
in front of the window so I look a
little bit like a ghost maybe there's
like a lipstick in here that I can apply
okay the first thing I'm gonna grab is
this white box I have no idea what is in
here oh this is from Ren Ren is a really
nice skincare brand actually haven't
used their stuff in quite a while but I
used to use it a lot nothing like an old
favourite of mine
oops this is called the perfect canvas
ooh I really like the packaging let me
put it back in there as you can see it's
like a really nice minimalist white
bottle that kind of looks like a serum
it says that it's silicone free skin
finishing serum oh I love it it's like
I'm
that's a packaging that's very
satisfying use after moisturizer so use
like a normal serum
oh I expected it to be kind of white or
milky but it's a clear serum I'm just
gonna put one dot on the back of my hand
that is really really nice it's
Encinitas on my hand like a proper glow
definitely gonna try that out you know
in there too some brands that I trust
for skincare and I would happily like
put that straight on my face Ren is
definitely one of those brands I would
trust have already seen anything new
from them for a while so that is
exciting I'm gonna put up they're still
on the skincare thing I got said a
couple of things in Clarence I'm not
really sure what the link is this is a
mascara high-impact lash elevating
mascara don't try this one
Lenny kept the most insane collection of
mascaras definitely the brands go to
this is just in a black packaging I'm
not sure I've tried this mascara
actually I would say it's one of my
favorite brands from mascaras so
definitely try this
oh it's like a coned brush I'm not sure
if that's me it might be new but the
skincare item that they sent is this
which looks very cool it's it's in
millennial pink which is great it's like
a clear packaging it says two-in-one
cleansing micellar gel plus light makeup
remover so it's saying it's two-in-one
because it's a cleanser but it also
removes your makeup so that's basically
like a gel version of the mess missile
or waters that everyone uses on cotton
pads so I'd be interesting to see how
that works I like to remove my makeup
with oil cleansers I do like gel
cleanser as well but they're always a
bit more like gel to oil formula which
this looks like a real proper gel
cleanser I would be worried from looking
at this that it's gonna dry out my skin
but I would happily try it and see if
that works over there oh they are both
new oh they've sent them together
because then I can see if the cleanser
takes the mascara off duh they're both
out this moment okay this is a brand
that I have seen everywhere they said in
Liberty its mane and tail and it looks
like something you would use on your
pets and it's got horns on the front I
think basically the idea of a brand is
that they used to use it on horses and
they realized it worked well in human
hair have I made that up I actually
don't think it has anything to do with
horses I think that's just the branding
I'm not sure it's a solution for dry
hair hard to comb hair
in mine and this is a new product for
them it's a detangler so I've seen the
shampoo and conditioner stuff that this
is a detangler and I love a spray
detangler it's the first thing I do want
to come at the shower on damp hair as I
spray it all over it all over before I
brush my hair I like the medieval heat
protector in which I don't think this
one does it tangles the town was a not
solution I need to smell it because I
love a good smelling hair product that
literally just smells like clean hair
smells a little bit like hay fever like
the nose sprays when you've got hay
fever it's very floral definitely
looking forward to trying that I've got
like one fashioned thing here everything
else is beauty I'm so excited for this
it's from my favorite ever brand Lily
and Lionel which I've spoken about
before I love this brand I love their
soldiers and they said they were gonna
send me another one and I can't wait see
what's inside
it's got a little note lovely tissue oh
it's really nicely wrapped with like a
bow oh my god this is so great so
they've got two shirts like this one is
like a black base color and one has a
white base color this is the white one
but it doesn't really like a white shirt
oh my god that is so gorgeous
it's a poppy print blue and red I wonder
if that's gonna be see-through Atul
think so blue red and white and it's so
pretty
I really love wearing color at the
moment their shirts are just the best
quality they sit so nicely they tuck
into jeans so well if I could I would
literally just have a Wardrobe full of
Lillian line or silk shirts love that so
much can't wait to wear it no sex I do
I've got two boxes here from here I
think that's how you say it it's a
makeup brand or the reflection is
intense it's marble with rose gold and
there's two of them and they both say
unlocked the secret so let's see what is
inside how do I open it oh it feels like
a book pure soirée
Diaries I'm gonna take out look what's
inside
lots of packaging my dad gets very angry
with the amount of boxes he has to break
up and putting the recycling bin every
week okay so there's two of these oh
there's the soirée diaries and the
contour diaries as I've been the car
one first few is a nice friend it's a
natural makeup brand actually if it into
that kind of thing this is the contour
kit sorry for the terrible reflection as
I wasn't planning on doing this video I
can't say that the setup is that
profession are three contour shades and
three highlight shades I never ever use
the highlight shades in these because
they're always like mattes but if you're
like full-on in to contouring then
that's how you add kind of light and
shade to your skin contour shades are
really nice it's a really dark one I
think the lightest one would be not best
for me to contour and the medium one
would be good as a bronzer and then the
other one this is an eye shadow palette
it's got 12 shades these ones at the
bottom I like full-on shimmer and then
the rest of map
I like that ratio there's more maps and
shimmers they look what you're pretty
actually let's see oh they're really
nice and creamy they're not all like dry
as really pretty actually this is from
it cosmetics I love it cosmetics
although I haven't used that much from
them I'm so obsessed with the CC cream
this is the your most beautiful you oh
it's got my name on it it says your most
beautiful you Lily
and then if I open this up it is a
bronzer or contour with a blush and a
highlight oh if I had a brush right now
I would so apply this the highlight
seems like a really nice champagne e
color a bit like the charlotte tilbury
one the blush it looks a little bit like
NARS orgasm it's got like a gold shimmer
running through it and the bronzer is
completely matte so you can definitely
be used as a contour I like that
if you forwards trying that I get sent a
lot of perfuse which is nice by having a
little bit of a fusspot when it comes to
perfuse it's just such like a personal
thing isn't it I mean this is nasty
I can never say this brand Narciso
Rodriguez would would we gay this I
think there's like a black in a pink one
and this is the pink one it celebrates
its first birthday wait I feel like I'm
reading this backwards not see so
ode apart farm pile powdery celebrates
his first birthday so wait this can't be
the original perfect I think this is
like an
date I dunno if this is the one that my
friend Deb's worse I know she wears this
brand love the bottle it literally looks
like it's got milk or something in it
that's nice it's floral but not too
sweet it's funny because it does smell
like a bit milky I like that I don't
know if it's me I've really struggled to
tell whenever I smells like a nice
perfume when someone asks um what it
isn't they say it's like a one of these
kind of big brands you'd find in the BG
hoard I'm always quite surprised because
I like kind of the German Oh more like
natural earthy scents that is nice they
they actually sent me a gift to go
alongside this perfume which was very
very generous of them looks like this
it's a cup nice baby pink box oh it's a
jewelry case jewelry jewelry still can't
say that word oh that's nice
it's got a mirror and then it's got like
put your jewelry in there and it's got a
little drawer cute I always think it's
so generous when brands send like
presents with the product ok few more
things I've been sensing by Terry
products I can't find the press release
or I don't know when these are coming
out I'm assuming they're just a kind of
part of a new collection this is the
youthful radiance powder blush I love by
Terry makeup
they literally comment like a little
purple pouch and then the most
incredible packaging look at that for a
blusher oh it comes with a brush totally
gonna try this this is in the shade sexy
pink number 5 it is proper like baby
pink shade I never use these brushes but
sometimes I think you would never go for
a shade like that but it actually makes
you it really it's like a nice like
healthy blush pretty I mean that
packaging is like proper heavy really
luxe like your your pain for the
packaging as well but the products are
also really great which is obviously
important you can get by Terry in space
and Kate she has so many good products
we actually interviewed by Terry Anna
and I on our at home with podcast a
little self plugs there if you didn't
hear that episode because it was quite
near the start I'll link it down below
is definitely one of my favorites to do
was it the first one no it's like the
second or something this is the hybrid
lipstick these are probably new bold
color impact contouring control it comes
in a pen like a concealer so it looks
like you're meant to wind up but
you press the bottom oh that's fun oh I
love the shape of the the top it's like
a teardrop shape I don't if you can see
that and it just hugs the lips so well
and the smell of this lipstick reminds
me of my grandma of it that is so nice
it feels like quite like satiny on the
lips it's like creamy but not like
completely matte my lips are quite sore
at the moment so I really hope they
don't react to the huh
another lipstick in like a Coralie shade
she is crazy passionate for a founder of
a brand she is like you have to go to
that podcast episode she's so great
okay still on the lipstick thing you
would have seen these on my Instagram
stories very what's so excited I got
sickness yesterday it's from hourglass
came in this massive like black
packaging and you open it up oh my god
isn't that the most the same thing
you've ever seen I was so excited to
receive this oops these are the
confession ultra slim high-intensity
refillable lipsticks it doesn't say on
this press release how much they are or
when they're coming out which is a bit
frustrating but I will link them down
below or any info that I find out
but basically you buy the lipstick in
this case I'm pretty sure you buy them
together that would make sense it would
be quite annoying you can't to buy this
by itself so this is beautiful like gold
printed applicator and then inside you
basically put one of these this is a
refill and you open like that and they
look like little creamy lipstick very
very slim and thin lipsticks there are
30 shades which is amazing
I tried quite a few of them so far Psalm
like the nude shades a really really
creamy it has like a matte finish but
it's light on the lips and it's very
comfortable but then I also tried one of
the kind of reddy-orange shades which
was really matte and quite drying so I
think they do have quite a different
finish to them I haven't got around to
trying them all yet because my lips have
been so sore but I'm gonna work my way
through them and pick my favorite shades
and I'll hopefully let you guys know at
some point I'm sure you'll see me
talking about them there are so many and
I mean it's a proper luxury thing if you
love our gloss and you like luxury
lipsticks then this is beautiful very
exciting launch lots of dark red colors
from I'd make a really nice present as
well if you bought someone like a red
lipstick in one of those gold applicator
things okay final thing is this massive
box which I haven't looked in yeah I
just got rich to like tear it open for
me but I'm pretty sure it's from zoella
got lots of sense
pretty zoella themed things in it ooh
just opened it often it looks like this
this says Lily I have a new lifestyle
collection launching this week and I
wanted you to have it really hope you
like it lots of love Zoe I've seen her
talk about this lifestyle range and it
looks so nice I just love the colors the
pink the grey the polka dots they work
on these collections so far ahead but
they always nail the trends so well this
is like a little booklet that says all
the different things she does is like
flower pots as cushions there's
notebooks as pencils there's like little
ornaments let's see what I've got ooh a
gold flower pot with polka dots around
the top I've got oh I like these things
I hope it's not broken okay it's not
broken it's not very good I was a little
bit broken oh it's totally broken I
think it's meant that's meant to be
stuck there I quite often get sent
things that are broken and it's not the
brand's fault it just it's really hard
to send things in the post so that's a
shame
that would have been very cute it's a
little gray a tray with a pink and gold
cacti to put your rings and jewelry on
very sweet massive shame there's broken
I thought it sounded a little bit
ratalie but I thought it came in two
parts and you put it together okay next
what was so many things
cushion I really like that it's got like
sleepy eyes oh it's really soft on the
back it's like velvet feeling now keep
that there
this is catching trinkets ceramic
jewelry tray terrified I really hope
this one isn't broken oh this one is not
broken and it's very sweet it is a pink
and white with gold eyelashes little
tray for jewelry the next thing I have
are some notebooks this one says it's
the little things a lot of good oh well
as a gold one in there as well there's
two notebooks and then this one is stay
on top of your world I just love this
polka dot pink grey
really really like that that is like a
mess I can organize them close she's
certainly so many things this one is a
little gold ornament that says inspire
she's left me nothing left to buy here
are some pencils it says right on point
and then Oh cute each pens are so so
different like hugs and kisses love from
your space faithfully and it will it'll
Z's on them and then in here in the
Polka Dot tissue paper is a big notebook
it's personalized it has an LP on it and
it says wonderful oh not a massive fan
of the texture if any of you have like a
fear of holes like I do that's a little
bit difficult to deal with I feel like
this is like ASMR no let's not get into
that but that is a really nice colored
notebook I can deal with it it's not too
holy and then it's just got big lined
pages on it how nice
oh my god so much stuff Thank You Zoe
and there's Oh Ella lifestyle team so
much stuff still buzzing about this
shirt can't wait to wear that and I hope
you guys enjoy kind of looking through
all of that with me I'm a very lucky
girl looking forward to trying all of
the things looking forwards putting this
on my bed and now I'm gonna go and have
dinner with my parents and rich who are
very patiently waiting for me in the
other room because I've been filming for
25 minutes that's gonna be fun to cut
down I hope you liked this video and
