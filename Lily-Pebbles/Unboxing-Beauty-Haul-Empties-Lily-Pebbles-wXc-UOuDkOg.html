a beauty haul and empties video I
decided to combine them because a lot of
the empties I actually ended up
repurchasing I feel like these days when
I finish a product is because i love it
so I always kind of either repurchase it
straight away or I already have a backup
so I thought I'd combine them together
and this is a bit of a collective haul
stuff from the drugstore space NK and
cult beauty let's start with the empties
and then I've got a huge box from Cobb
you see here that I haven't actually
opened yet so i'll open that on camera
with you guys first thing that I
finished is from super facialist by
owner Brennan you can get this in Boots
and it's the probiotic micellar
cleansing water I now use this instead
of bioderma i just find it easier to get
hold of and i really like it i find it a
little bit more hydrating I don't really
use it to remove my makeup sometimes I
do if I'm lazy but then I'll always kind
of cleanse afterwards sometimes I use
this in the morning i just find it's
really good to have a micellar water
around so I repurchase that straight
away I'm already getting through it
quite quickly i also really like the
packaging of this the next empty is the
solar powder bronzer by soap &amp;amp; Glory I
feel like I go through this all the time
I think this is the second one I
finished but to be fair I didn't really
finish it what happened is for some
reason I would end up using one side
more than the other even though I feel
like I just swish around in the middle
the which one the more shimmery side
always goes down first maybe it's the
formula and then it always ends up
cracking so as you can kind of see I've
got half a bronzer here and I decided
just get another one because I love it I
use it every single day without fail
sometimes i use NARS Laguna but so yeah
well most the time i use this one so i
bought a brand new one and i love it
it's just the best bronzers but a bitmap
a bit of shimmer it's just like a really
good all over natural bronze the next
thing I finished was my Anastasia brow
Wiz I used soft brunette and the pencil
actually ran out there's nothing left
but also what happened and I've heard
that this has happened to a few other
people the brush end has completely
snapped off and I didn't drop it or
break it I don't know what happened i
just noticed one day when i open
up that it was broken so that was a bit
annoying and this all happened before
holiday and I didn't have time to order
one on court beauty because I think
that's the only place you can get it in
the UK so I saw this one from Smashbox
when I was in Boots and I thought I'd
pick it up and give it a go because the
packaging looks very similar it's got a
spoolie on one end and a really fine
pencil in the other it's called the
smashbox brow tech mapped pencil and i
got it in dark brown the lady at the
counter convinced me I had to get dark
brown but I actually find this a little
bit too dark I just feel that when it's
a dark brown I'm more likely to go over
the top with my brows I use this today
and if I've got a really light hand it
can work and I will definitely keep
using it I do like it but I also
repurchase the Anasazi four hours which
is hopefully in my cup beauty order that
I'm going to open in a minute so I do
you think this is good actually it's
very similar to the brow ways but i
think if i got it again I'd get a
lighter brown shade I just feel like if
you've got a lighter brown you can build
it up you can't really take away as
easily i also finished estee lauder
clear brow gel and i did really like
this actually it's got a really tiny
like brush head which is quite nice
actually because then you find you don't
put too much on I don't know why I
didn't repurchase this I don't really
tend to repurchase clear brow gel I
always like to try something new I'm
trying mom form bit / or beeper I don't
know how to pronounce it which is an
Austrian drugstore brand and when I
finished that i'll leave the try
something new or go back to the blink
brow gel because i really like that one
but this is actually was really nice to
use and then my final empty is a
foundation I don't think I've ever
finished a foundation so was really
exciting also really scary because I
took my last pump and was like no I
didn't know it was the end and it's my
NARS sheer glow I really love this
foundation I went on a photo shoot
yesterday and I already done my
foundation and the makeup artists said
oh your foundation is really matte which
I thought was weird because I always
thought this is quite a glowy foundation
so that's made me question things but I
do still really love it and I can't
believe I properly finished foundation
so I went to spacing Kate buy another
one I can't believe they haven't yet
made it so that you can put a lid on the
pump I find it so irritating the pump
gets so messy it's so hard travel with
it's a glass bottle the packaging is
pants I use this by Terry lid and I just
like show
put on which has changed my life but I
went out and got a new foundation
straight away it's in the shade
deauville and I just love this as an
everyday very easy foundation it's got
enough coverage I can like film with it
and I know it's going to last all day
but it's not too heavy and I think it
looks really nice on the skin if you saw
my matte liquid lipstick video you'll
know that I picked up five of the new
liquid lipsticks and it was very
exciting purchase I'm still really
excited about these I still want to get
the other nude one I love having these
in my collection I'm really enjoying
using them and I haven't been excited
about Mac products in quite a long time
so if you haven't seen that video I
review all of these with swatches my
thoughts everything so I will link that
he want to go have a watch at Christmas
I was really lucky to be sent one of the
askia crackers and a car remember ostia
Center to me or cult bc but it's
basically a Christmas cracker that when
you open up I didn't actually know what
was in it on Christmas Day I put it on
my little placemat and I opened it up
and it was a travel size of the
Renaissance cleansing gel which is my
absolute favorite cleanser it's a gel
that tends to an oil you would have
heard me speak about it all the time
it's really good for taking off your
makeup and really hydrating but the
full-size is so big the packaging so
annoying you never know when it's coming
to an end and it's huge it's so annoying
for traveling so I was really excited to
have a travel size and as far as I'm
aware you can't buy these by themselves
it with like a limited edition Christmas
thing and then after christmas i was
browsing on the cult beauty website and
i saw that the crackers had gone into
the sale and there were 10 pounds each
so I got so excited that I ordered five
I literally have one two three four da
minute five I have five Oscar travel
sized cleansers but i love this cleanser
so much that i know i will use it for
ever and these are hopefully going to
last all my trips not just this year
maybe next year I hope there's no
sell-by date on cleansers I didn't even
think about that but seriously this is
going to change my travel in life
because i always find when I travel I
end up using travel sized products that
I have and then my skin gets all messed
up so I can still use my favorite
cleanser packaging is beautiful and
fifty pounds for that many cleanses how
much is in here 40 milliliters I think
that's pretty good I don't know not very
good at maths but it felt like a bargain
okay so now for the exciting part
because i myself can't even really
remember why all
but I made a cult beauty order the other
night it came yesterday and I haven't
opened it yet so I'm really excited to
see what's inside I'll open it with you
guys what's all sellotaped up a minute
we rip it open Oh hope nothing broke oh
no there's a highlighter in there okay
it's all bundled up in here so let me
just grab what's inside okay don't think
I'm mental I really think you guys are
good in governmental but there's an
Oscar Oasis cleansing gel only because
I've nearly finished my full size one I
think I've new finished it and I'm
getting a bit panicky so I got another
full sized ones keeping my bathroom for
when I'm not traveling and I'm just
using it every day this one has like
pretty stars on the packaging wonder why
merry and bright I was like the
Christmas packaging oh yeah I also
picked up a midi sighs wet brush if you
haven't heard of a wet brush it is the
best hairbrush ever so much better than
tangle teezer I've never liked the
tangle teezer find it awkward to hold it
actually doesn't get through my knots
but this one is amazing let me wait for
now I had wonderful size brushes and I
was gonna get the mini one but they look
really really mini I thought this one
might be good size for traveling they do
come in funky colors but I just went for
black yeah that's a really good size so
it's the MIDI one it's not huge it's not
tiny but perfect for taking away on
holiday with you this seriously gets
through any knots i wish i had this as a
kid it's amazing if you are a mom and
you have a child was really curly
naughty hair get one of these get it in
like a pretty color okay let's hope this
isn't broken i also because i absolutely
love my becca champagne pop highlighter
but it is quite intense I feel like I
wear it too often during the day I think
it was Anna said she loved the shade
unless I completely imagined it but it's
the moonstone shade highlighter I don't
have any of the other Becca highlighters
so I picked up moonstone it's not broken
whew I looks really pretty it looks a
little bit more shimmery than I thought
it would be there highlighters are so
buttery and soft it's insane oh that's
really pretty it's a bit like the
charlotte tilbury highlighter it's like
a champagne e very subtle pretty glow
and if you can see that on my hand I am
highlighter obsessed so I'm really
excited to try that out I feel like I
where highlight at every single day if
you have dry skin is too
a really easy way to make a skin with
Chloe and pretty what else is in here oh
yeah my Anastasia brow Wiz so I got it
again in soft brunette is a cool soft
brown oh no that the Richard oh no I
didn't look at my old one which was
actually medium brown don't four soft
brown this time let's see hopefully it
will suit me hustle freshen you i'm sure
this one's gonna break again yeah i
think that shade will be alright it's
like an ashy light brown so i'm happy to
be reunited with that again and then
just one more thing in here probably the
most exciting i have been missing you so
much i think when i moved house I left
these at home and just forgot about
women's we've got to repurchase them but
i recently bought them for as a present
for my friend Lucy and suddenly
remembered how much I need them in my
life just in bubble wrap minute if you
haven't yet guest it's the michelle rock
O'Neill therapy Himalayan detox salt you
can buy refills so you don't have to buy
this liked in every time but I lost my
chain i think i left at my old house so
I just went for the tin and the salts
and these are oh my god they saw better
than I even remember these are magic I
don't really believe in all the
hocus-pocus stuff but I swear these
salts will change your life put a little
bit in my bath and I find it so relaxing
I don't want any other product even my
aromatherapy associates bath oils which
actually love don't affect me like these
bath salts do they are so so relaxing
and amazing and detoxing and I love them
and I need them in my bathroom so I'm
really happy i have those again so
that's everything from my hall let me
know if you enjoy this video and thank
you so much for watching I'll see you
guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
