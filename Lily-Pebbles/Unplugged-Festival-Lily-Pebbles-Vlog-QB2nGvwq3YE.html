running really late so this is a very
like rushed beginning to my blog but
today we are going to the innocent
unplugged festival I'm very excited only
problem is this unplugged and that's not
prior to the music it's a no technology
phone's off festival so a bit nervous
about that I know it sounds sad my life
is my phone and it's just like an
extension of my body so it's gonna be
very weird but I'm looking forward to it
they said that I can vlog because
obviously they don't want the promotion
as well so I'll probably be the only
person there with any kind of technology
and everyone will look it'd be really
weird but I'm definitely gonna vlog it
and then edit and stuff when I get home
so I'll kind of be without technology
for the day because I won't have my
phone and stuff we're going with rich
rich best friend Evo his name is Alex we
call him Nev oh I know it's confusing
and my best friend Hannah says I've got
two little best friends so that we're
really nice this is what I'm wearing
some it's really sunny today it's in
Kent I'm wearing like a striped shirt
Topshop belt and Topshop these are the
girlfriend denim shorts and converse
it's meant to be hot although it's kind
of early in the morning so it's not warm
yet she's been packing up my stuff I'm
terrible at camping so I've good news
what I brought with me but let's do this
we're just having a go at me because
I've got worse in my age that quote what
rich just said words it was worth it
getting ready when you met me or that
uni and I hardly wore any mates ah
that's why we're gonna go pick up Hannah
and go get some breakfast
cuz I'm so hungry I'm not even taking a
phone charger with me it's so weird now
we're in the car or can you tell the
indicator just waiting to pick up Hannah
I could tell you a little bit more
because that was like a panic rush out
flat I feel like I've forgotten
everything that I need so innocent
festival my sister helped put together
the music acts for this so there's a lot
of like friends and people we know
playing which is really exciting my
sister Jo Jo's working at the festival
she does like face painting as a bit of
a side job so she's gonna be there doing
that I can't wait to get some more face
painting done so there's gonna be people
we know it's gonna really children
relaxes I can outdoor spa with like
outdoor hot tubs and there's a banquet
dinner that we're having at like 7:30
tonight they think the weather's gonna
be really nice
really cool it's like a really young
festival I think it's only in his third
or fourth year so I don't really know
what its gonna be like but I'm just
hoping there's like yummy food good
music and good weather and some alcohol
you've got Hanna with us now we just
picked up some croissants and coffee and
we're meeting neither there so we're
just gonna drive that it's about hours
together Kent
kind of what I said that is rich his
best friend and my best friend so
neither is rich as best man and Hanna's
like pretty much my best woman so it's a
best man in women trip
it's raining I'm wearing shorts oh I
didn't bring anything rain to procure
because this is gonna really hard on me
what the hell is going on
we all need away and can't find first of
all I mean I thought the festival's
quite a big thing to find it's not like
a little thing there's no other cards no
people but oh you just said to me if you
don't need to quit it's only a trip no
that's not fair oh we're in great
locations and Claire's I think just
happy it is apparent I should have
followed the signs of the event the
signs about anything there were signs it
is the best for the world like oh you
haven't seen my foot for a little while
you found a sign and we found some other
cars so I think we're on the right track
although this track looks the same as
all the other tracks okay we're here
leave us here now they're somewhere and
what are you in this are they yeah
company and we've got loads of bags we
actually have to park quite far so we're
just kind of painting because I'm
complaining but you know who I am

we actually have one because we don't
have a ten with them in the car
