an updated makeup storage and collection
as you guys know I recently moved so I
had to change things up although I was
pretty happy with my setup before I had
kind of my daily makeup out in clear
Mooji Mooji clear mooji drawers and then
I had a big IKEA Alex with labels that I
used my DiMeo label maker for for all my
other kind of work-related makeup that
was fine it's just that when I've moved
there isn't space for that set up so
I've had to change things up a bit I've
had to get rid of the IKEA Alex but I
kind of liked the idea of having all my
makeup in one place when I had daily
makeup and work makeup separate I feel
like it made me hoard more because I
could just think like oh that will go
with my collection of foundations
whereas it needs to be small ish so that
I actually use everything so I had a
huge clear out I think you guys saw that
in a vlog or snapchat or something and I
feel like I've now got a good collection
for what I do I'm not going to give one
of those boring disclaimers you guys
have seen these videos before so I've
got a good balance of makeup that I
wanna wear and bits that I might need if
I'm doing a comparison video or a blog
post I wanna refer to another foundation
feel like I've got a good balance of
both so the only place in the new place
for my makeup I have nowhere in my
bedroom for even daily makeup to go so
it all had to go in my office somewhere
I've obviously got my desk in there and
my computer I have really got much else
I think we're going to have to store
coats and shoes in there as well but
there was kind of one space the side of
the chimney breast that was good enough
that I thought I could put all my makeup
there and somehow make it space for me
to do my makeup as well so I originally
ordered a vanity desk and then realised
that I didn't have any space for that so
I cancelled it so I basically have a big
chest of drawers the ones I chose are
from Urban Outfitters I looked for a
long time to find something that was
right and it was quite hard to find
something that I needed I didn't want
you know I had quite a specific idea of
how I wanted the drawers to be and what
I wanted it to look like so it could
also just be storage my office so these
are great they were around 300 pounds I
think which is a lot of money but for a
big piece of furniture is no
that bad the drawers are a little bit
kind of clunky they don't pull out
smoothly because they're not on like
rollers that's a little bit annoying but
if you're careful you know something you
can get used to so I keep all my makeup
hair a lot of stuff in there I also keep
my cameras and stuff in there as well as
you'll see so I'm really happy with it
and it's got a nice surface area as well
for me to put some bits and what I've
done is I've hung a mirror above it so I
can stand and do my makeup anyway I'm
going to stop blabbing and actually go
and show you the thing so this is just
an intro to let you guys know what this
video is about I really hope you enjoy
it and let's go look at my new storage
so this is the chest of drawers from
Urban Outfitters there are 15 drawers in
total it has a woody metal beige feel to
it I really like the metal we have a lot
of metal in our flat and I think it
looks really nice I love the industrial
feel the legs on this are really good it
all came put together already and the
drawers had these cute little handles on
them too just above the drawers is a
circular mirror as I said I'd like to
stand here and do my makeup this one is
from home and pantry and I just had to
buy a hook from home base secure it to
the wall and then the mirror just hangs
on that and it's really not that heavy
either
I love the rope and again the metal goes
with the drawers on top of the drawers I
have some plants and ornament my makeup
brushes and some of my favorite perfumes
I love to have plants in the flat I love
the greenery I love the vibe it gives
cacti I think look really cool they're
not very French way though so I got a
money plant to go alongside that and I
love how these look together they're
both from home base the copper Elle
ornament which got me for Christmas last
year and that's from Oliver bonus and
then I have my makeup brushes in these
two glasses the one on the left is from
H&amp;amp;M home the one on the right is from
Cal's and sub dial and then I have some
of my favorite perfumes out and display
three from German alone the fresh fig
apricot scent molecule oh one and Chanel
number five just because it looks really
pretty
so each drawer is labeled I use my DiMeo
label maker for this and each label
tells me what's inside so let's go into
the first drawer which is base and in
here I keep my foundations and tinted
moisturizers
some of my favorites include NASA glow
and Estee Lauder CC cream in the second
drawer I've labeled it prep this is
where I keep powders setting sprays
primers and concealers so my favorites
include the Charlotte Tilbury retoucher
the hourglass diffused light powder and
the Urban Decay all nighter setting
spray in the third drawer which I've
labeled daily I either keep daily makeup
or makeup I need to try out like this
Bobbi Brown Christmas palette the next
drawer is called blush and this is
actually where I keep my blushes
highlighters bronzers and contours both
cream and powder some of my favorites
include NARS deep throat hourglass mood
exposure and Becca champagne pop the
next drawer is palette so this is where
I keep all my eye shadow palettes
including my Mac palette my NYC best of
Broadway and my lorac palette the next
door is just labeled eyes this is where
I keep single eyeshadows cream
eyeshadows eyeshadow sticks and
eyeliners some of my favorites include
the Estee Lauder chain and Mac
groundwork the by Terry Umbra black
stars and the Tom Ford liquid liner and
Charlotte Tilbury Elizabeth violet then
we have mascaras and eyebrow products my
favorite mascara is our the Clinique
high impact extreme volume and the Too
Faced better than sex mascara the next

here I keep all my lip glosses lip balms

here are my Sephora lip creams and Kat

Liberty and a very little Mac syrup as
well as my favorite German lip balm and
the Clarins instant light lip Perfector
in the tools draw this is just kind of
extra brushes hair bands and hair grips
and then in the perfume draw are my
other perfumes whether they're not in
season at the moment or I don't use it
all the time there's replica lazy Sunday
morning and Estee Lauder bronze goddess
which is a really summery perfume the
nails drawers is a big one I had to cut
down a lot to get them into one drawer I
have quite a lot from Essie and now
Zink some from Topshop and Chanel and
Revlon I also have my nail care products
in here as well some of my favorites are
Essie maximilian strauss her and Essie
