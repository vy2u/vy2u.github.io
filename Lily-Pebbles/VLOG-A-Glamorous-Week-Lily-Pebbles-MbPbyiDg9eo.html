vlog now just a quick warning I feel
like this week's vlog it's gonna be very
unrealistic because I normally vlog
about three days of the week and this
week I'm doing some pretty cool things
Anna and I have our meet up today which
is that the NARS pop-up store is facing
Kay tomorrow night I think I'm going to
a kind of new film screening thing and
then find out weird Wireless Festival
all the other days in between her normal
boring working days but I'm just gonna
vlog the fun stuff so it's not always
glamorous and fun but this week is a
pretty cool week so today is art nas
Meetup
I don't think I have to be there till
the afternoon I'm actually going that my
hair done first because as you can see
it really needs a good washing I'm gonna
go to Percy and Reed which is a really
nice salon in town but I'm just doing
some work and I'm so annoyed because I
took some really nice photos of my
grandma's vanity table for a post and
I've lost the photos I don't know if you
guys ever do that if you're bloggers but
it's the most frustrating thing when you
lose photos so now I'm just trying to
think of some other stuff to post about
I'm gonna work this morning and then
head into town softening so I've just
tweeted saying if you guys have any
video or blog post requests to send them
my way if you ever have any requests for
videos or posts just tweet me or comment
or anything I love hearing all your
ideas and you're the ones who read it
and watch them so I want to do what you
guys like so it's now time to get ready
for our meetup and as you can see I am
barefaced I think I'm wearing this dress
I'll show you my outfit properly when I
actually am fully dressed I'm going to
use one of the new Naz dual intensity
eyeshadows because that's what they are
launching and that's what we're doing
our event for this one is in Dion and it
looks like a kind of silvery when it's
in the pan but when you put it on it's
kind of like topi glittery kind of shade
it's really nice over brown eyeshadow I
will show you and it's on
okay so I'm gonna head off for my hair
appointment now I promise I don't go to
the hairdresser's every week it's just
so happen that those vlogs I have I'm
actually pretty scared of hairdressers
but I want to have my hair all nice for
the event
so I'm gonna go just get washed and
blow-dry Oh also an update on my
Brazilian blow-dry keratin treatment
thing my hair is feeling so good it
dries amazing like just naturally it has
completely like frizz free it takes I
think my quarter of the time to
straighten now so I'm really really
happy with her
okay so my hair's done and it was such a
nice blow-dry I really loved Percy Reid
it's a really small kind of family
feeling salon right in central London
and the guy who did my hair was so good
he started blow-drying from the front
back so I know that he really gets curly
hair give out the best thing you can do
for curly hair and it was just so nice a
lot person we products so that was good
and they use sulfate free shampoo and
conditioner because my carrots and
treatment so I'm really happy with how
it came out and now we're going to go at
me Anna
I'm here with honor and we're eating
guacamole as per usual getting nice and
garlic okay we meet you go just on our
way okay now we're the last pop-up
stories and he lets me you guys will be
there to meet us I'm really excited
mm I know yes guacamole tea so we're now
at the NARS pop-up store and it looks
amazing I thought I'd quickly show you
guys 50 now make up beneath amazing
eyeshadows personal this is if any one
photo and hashtags narcissus looks like
this then it automatically prints on
this printer which is really cool love
this here's one way to my vlog
so I'm home now and I've locked myself
in one of the rooms because everyone's
asleep in my house
but I was thinking on the way home like
what to say I'm completely speechless
that was just the most amazing event
first of all most importantly I am so
happy that I get to deal with these
things with my best friend Anna it's so
nice that we get to do things together
and she's just the perfect person to do
these things with so that is something I
keep thinking about but also it was so
nice meeting all of you we met so many
of you guys tonight and I can't get over
like how similar we all are so many
girls in one room and we all have the
same interest and it wasn't one like
awkward silence we were just chatting
the whole time I met so many amazing
women it was so nice hearing like what
you guys do for jobs about your
boyfriends and your families and your
holidays and just getting to chat to
everyone properly talk about makeup and
beauty and bloggers and youtubers and
all the things we loved it was really
really a great night so thank you so
much if you came and if you couldn't
come don't worry we're gonna do more
things hopefully me and Anna we'll do a
meet-up
the end of July we're hoping we want to
do a big picnic so let me know if you
guys are up for something like that in
London but I'm still just a bit
speechless I feel like I can't put into
words what a great night it was I'm
gonna attempt to go to sleep but I don't
think I'll be able to because I was like
buzzing from excitement it's like having
the best birthday party ever with like
all my friends in the same room I
literally feel like you guys are like my
best friends meeting you all tonight was
just amazed they're not so exciting and
never say like pretty and had a nice
makeup and was friendly and so nice and
I'm talking again I'm really I
swore oh my god I'm really bad at this
I'm sorry I'm gonna go to bed now thank
you so much and gone for everything I'm
really happy hey guys so it's Wednesday
evening and tonight I'm going to a movie
preview with my mum I'm going to see
begin again which was really nice
definitely not something rich would want
to see so I'm taking my mom's and rich
is also gotten to a movie preview
tonight which is really funny he's
actually taking mark to see transformers
which is a much more appropriate boy
film so he's going to be vlogging there
so I'm insert his clips hopefully if
they come out okay I'm really excited to
see this film it looks really good
so me and my mom are in Soho now we're
trying to avoid the flying ants and try
to find the hotel room I think the one
who films on in like this little private
viewing and hotel thing right here
we celebrate friendship and it's a film
that celebrates the white challenge
ensign that's what people always said
you will see in the film the second she
comes on is the Y Johnny Johnson
so we just got my transformers reanimate
it was pretty output fellows absolutely
but it was pretty cool pretty cool quite
long as well though no wood right where
do you think with the climax
yeah I definitely gotta go yeah
transformers
yeah I'll go see so we will come up the
film and we are starving so I've taken
everyone to assure you which is the
rather place I think I beat you once
before in a blog and I think rich is
going to come and meet us which would be
really nice haven't seen them all day
riches here give one night morning guys
today is Friday and today I'm going to
Wireless Festival well I'm actually
gonna go about five o'clock because I've
got a lot of work to do so I'm gonna
work all day and then I think Anna's
coming here for four and we're gonna go
together we're going with San Tropez
although they invited us to go and have
a fake tan before we go which would have
been really nice I didn't have time so I
have fake tan myself using my favorite
where is it here's an unopened one the
tan I always talk about so I'm looking
nice and bronzed hopefully and yeah
we're gonna go this afternoon evening
and hopefully have lots of fun okay so
I'm just waiting for Anna to get to my
house she's on her way now and I thought
I'd show you what I'm wearing what
makeup I'm wearing on my lips I'm
wearing the Kat Von D lipstick liquid
lipstick thing in Bachelorette it's kind
of a dark pink eye has time a hair up
because it's a bit greasy and I've been
lazy in a comic book to wash it so
hopefully it looks alright and I'm just
wearing eye black Topshop t-shirt and
Topshop shorts and a belt and I haven't
decided on shoes yet I think I'm gonna
wear trainers better safe than sorry
and I'm gonna buy t-shirt she's wearing
a white one yes that's just what friends
do
so now we have to find where we're
actually going we stuck outside the
festival someone inside has our tickets
and no one's phones are working
so we'll be listening carnie from out
here we got our wristbands
first
I can't believe
so I am home after Wireless Festival and
it was really fun the VIP section was
amazing really really amazing Pharrell
Williams is so good I did think Kanye
was good but he went off in rants a lot
and it kind of ruined it for me he
literally spoke for about 20 minutes
about Nike and how they annoy him and
it's just not really what people at
festivals want people just wanna dance
and have fun as that was a bit annoying
but had a really nice time with Ana and
it was so nice fun even in the Sabrina
as well I really really love Sabrina so
I will pull her links below this video
because you guys need to check out her
blog she's a lovely lovely girl I think
that's all for this vlog it's been a bit
of a crazy week with lots of kind of fun
events but this weekend I'm just gonna
chill out with rich I think we're gonna
do a bit of shopping because he has
spices summer clothes
and I'm gonna see my friend Debs it's
gonna be nice and chilled so I'll see
you guys next week for another vlog and
yeah that's all thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
