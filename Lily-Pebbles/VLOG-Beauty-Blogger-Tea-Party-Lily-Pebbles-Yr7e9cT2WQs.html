would vlog again I not doing that much
today though I'm filming a video and
then I'm actually going around to s days
for tea with Anna and media so that
would be nice excuse the no makeup face
of Lycia just worked it up and come down
to my office check my emails and I'm
gonna go have some breakfast
this is currently what my room looks
like this is all the stuff I'm going to
film my video I'm gonna do a haul video
that's gonna be up next Thursday so
don't forget to watch that when it gets
uploaded but this is the mess of my room
at the moment and my shelves are just
covered in crap so I need to kind of
tidy this up so I can have a nice pretty
background and film all this stuff down
here and do my makeup
my makeups done I have no idea what I
put on I just threw it on being a bit
like just to read because I just found
out the most ridiculous exciting news
but I'm gonna be one of those annoying
people and say I can't tell you until
it's completely confirmed but follow me
on twitter at Lily pebbles because when
it is I will be screaming about it on
there I'm sure I'm really quite like
nervous and excited anyway I've done my
makeup I will have to rethink about what
the hell I just put on my face so I can
put it in the description bar of this
video and my whole video but I'm ready
to film now so I'm gonna sit down and
fill my hole I wanna I will come back to
you after before I start filming I
thought I'd quickly show you my setup I
decided just to do it in front of the
plain wall for this one because I
couldn't find anything nice to put on
the shelves and it was stressing me out
so I've just got my camera set up here
and ring light I bought the same ring
right it's Anna
and I'm really happy with it and that's
about it I'm gonna get film I finished
filming that took me like 15 minutes
that was super quick I was in a hyper
chatty mood so fine done finished
I'm gonna go upload those videos onto my
computer and then I need to get ready to
go because I'm gonna be really late
