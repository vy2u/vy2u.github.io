vlog today because I've got kind of a
busy day but kind of a fun day as well
I'm just off out to buy ingredients and
stuff because I'm going to do a blog
post on cookie dough gift or something
like that so I'm gonna make cookies and
Anna just called to say she's gonna pop
round and my house is filled with
children so it's bit mental in there so
I'm just popping out and this is my
little car by the way I'm actually
getting a new car three minutes just
bought a new car which is very exciting
I've had this one for eight years and
it's very old I think it's like 13 years
old so I'm very excited to get a new car
but I kind of love my old little Yaris
yeah I'm going to go out try and find
ingredients and try and find a jar I
need to find like one of those Clippy
jars
so I'm on a mission and I'll let you
know how they get on so they'll be
really good and go to the local shops to
see if they have what I need but they
were rubbish they didn't Tesco's me and
so I got everything in this bag so all I
really needed I had some stuff at home
to giant Dairy Milk things and I thought
I'd put in by an Oreo waltz and mix it
up also they've got butter sugar in this
jar this is the kind of thing I was
looking for a big jar like this so the
aim is basically to make the cookie
dough scoop it into little pools and
then put it in the freezer and then once
they're frozen I'm gonna put some into
this jar and like wrap it all up and I
think that would make a really nice gift
because then all the person has to do is
take out the frozen and cookie dough
balls put them in the oven for 10
minutes and they have cookies obviously
not when frozen but they defrost really
quickly and so I thought that was quite
a cute present idea and they do a blog
post on it and but it won't be up for a
couple of weeks after you see this
because I'd like a backlog of things
yeah that's the aim today so I'm just
waiting for Ana at the station because I
think by time I got all this stuff
should probably be here soon so I'm just
gonna hang around here and wait for her
and then I'm gonna go home to the house
of madness with all the children and try
and bake cookies without them kind of
interfering and and I see what happens I
look like when I get home back home now
baby sorry no just shake the flowers
there careful if that goes everywhere
okay we need self-raising flour unsalted
butter castor sugar lots of chocolate
one egg milk that's it manager okay
we've got the butter and the sugar
mounted it a little better melted it a
little bit so you put that in in any I
turning it locks no way we can do it I
think it turn it
yeah look okay and then this at the back
there's like a little lever probably do
it one-handed can you feel it push it in
a little so yeah oh you know they're
they're the boss don't think I don't
catch a thing of it yeah and then it
goes on startled oh yeah oh yeah so
mixing this until it's creamy that I
know you maybe that goes like a creamy
young
you need to get one of these Kenwood
babies they'll get it faster just
cracked an egg in a glass and mixed it
together and then I turn it on and off
boring slowly
sighs better than using the hand written
in the self-raising flour and I was
gonna do that well I break up all of
these yummy chocolate bars and we're
gonna put them in like trouble so you
just broke it all the chocolate up into
bits and we're just chucking it in with
the mix and then we go to mix this bit
by hand because always the machine might
have a heart attack and break and then
put them into balls into the oven and
that's it they're like the easiest
cookies ever so these are the ones I'm
gonna put in the freezer so I put them
in my little jar and then the rest are
in other oh you can't see you could just
see me there in the other than they only
have about five more minutes and they
come out really fluffy and then you just
have to wait for them to harden and
they're amazing and I was looking
through my mum's maryberry book from
1970 something ridiculous like the
oldest cookies are out literally only
ten minutes in the oven they're so easy
and these ones are kind of playing with
chocolate bits and there is the ones
that I need to put in the freezer
however I hoped on that yeah I'm gonna
do that now Anna's painting her nails
while we were waiting for the cookies
over there to get yummy
what you think our teas sorry I'm jelly
berry and jelly this is Anna's nails so
this is berry and jelly and like she the
nice name let's finish on it then you
love a good news can we get busier I
might cut them are just a kind
I kind of like drawing together just
tried the cookie and its immense it's
amazing they're still really like
uncooked it's their really stuff but
that's gonna be a bad angle of meeting I
just thought you eating those and that
I'm using a tiny can find watch them
right now forgot to take the vlog on the
final thing I've just put them all away
back in the freezer but I put them in
this jar and I wrote this little note
ready to bake cookies and then on the
other side I did like instructions of
what Steve I've taken photos for my blog
anyway so you'll have to go look at that
post if you want to see how to do it and
I just went to M&amp;amp;S and knocked over a
horse behind a bistro
I'm Dave I've got really bad headache
now this day has to be a really looks a
lot great day but we're in town
eight
we're just going to get to Selfridges
and do you a bit we need to do
