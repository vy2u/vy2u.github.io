yesterday I tried to start this vlog but
it was a bit of a fail I was very tired
from landing at 3:30 in the morning so
let's rewind to yesterday and I try and
talk you through what I did
let's start with this very strange tired
vlogging bit morning guys this is a
weird way to start a vlog but I'm going
to go with it anyway it's 8:30 in the
morning and I landed from my holiday and
last night we got back to get wicker
like half 12 and got home a half three
so I've had about 4 hours sleep but I
had the nicest holiday ever I didn't
film because I wanted to just relax we
went to Greece and it was so relaxing
and I'm just like come back and
everything so go go go but I'm excited
today I can't like hear myself speak
today I have a photo shoot with a weekly
magazine I really love so that's really
exciting but I'm up early and I need to
like get rid of holiday hair and holiday
body and everything so then my
hairdresser came round and did my hair
that I looked half decent and I did my
makeup and I forgot to vlog all of that
and then me and rich headed into town
for the photo shoot which was actually
with Look magazine I also bumped into
Louise and Zoe and Jim were there and
that was really nice to catch up with
them and then I had my photo shoot which
was in the book club in Old Street and
it was really embarrassing because
everyone was there watching but I think
the photos came out really well so I
think that might be in Look magazine in
the first week of September but I'll
show you guys when it comes out ok so I
just had my little photo shoots with
Look magazine by the way I am allowed to
say
I didn't vlog anything cuz it's really
embarrassing having a photo taken you're
not like a model I didn't have to pose
and it was in the book club so it was in
front of other people which is really
embarrassing but I think the focus came
out nicely and that's gonna be out I
think the first week of September our
tweets when it is I'm really excited
it's Emily on the back page where it
says style file which is one of my
favorite pages in Look magazine anyway
so then we headed over to Anna's because
I haven't seen her all week when I was
away and I was really excited to catch
up and I think we were gonna have dinner
with her and mwah
so you went round there and had a giant
catch up and she made us meatballs for
dinner and it was delicious
and then the boys are meant to go out on
a bike ride but rich was so tired so he
ended up going to the cinema and we went
to see the new Inbetweeners film which
is like the second one and it was so
funny literally we cried the whole thing
I've never heard Anna laughs out loud so
much it was really funny and she even
did really well in the bits where
they're throwing up so so funny so that
was kind of that for yesterday and today
is summer in the city so I'm just
waiting for Anna to get to my house and
then we're gonna drive over there and
hopefully see lots of you guys and see
lots of other youtubers which should be
nice so it just arrived Ally Pally
Anna is here fell out of my hair just
cleaning off a bug on my window because
she's squished a bug I really don't mind
like posing a tissue to wipe the dead
body so I must let it out ya know you
could it definitely code it so we're
gonna go in now and see what crazy stuff
was going on inside I'm very casual I'm
wearing a white t-shirt and jeans and
Birkenstocks I'm not very dressed up but
well she going yeah let's do their thing
a lipstick on
we just went into the YouTube news and I
got some sweets and Facebook and it was
done me and she'll
up into the main room
there was better than a skater's loads
going on and you met loads of nice
people and fun didn't you will give this
little ass probably now I do every
property because sir I'm jet lagged even
as any two hours delay this is what you
call a friend I know just sacrificed a
Saturday night to help me sort through
my nail polish collection which is here
and I'm having to like choose the ones I
want to keep and the ones I want to put
in the bag and it's hard look at almost
in tears look at choosing children go
favorite child all these dark reds okay
we're getting there for laying them out
we're gonna do them in color order
eventually I'm just going through the
greens and the blues which is my
weakness and I'm struggling and reading
a bit emotional gosh look at this some
of them are separating badly where's
this right green first time I bought
this cuz Ingrid mentioned in the video
oh I think we've finished I can't
believe this is how we spend just leave
then literally just so I could take an
Instagram of this but I think this looks
pretty good we need to just you just
make it neater I want to count I think I
cut down my new poster collection cry
lockers bag of nail polishes I don't
want ya attention I'm excited you guys
better like this Instagram guys I've
worked out my calculator and apparently
I've got it down to 135 nail polishes
which that's you still still sounds like
a lot but I think that's good this looks
so cool
I can't wait sick of a self it I just
took a test photo and it looks like this
switch it's pretty cool
oh wait that's on the wrong way this is
the finished result these are like nail
care and top coat base coat and then
blues and greens and pinks and oranges
and grays and purples and whites and
that's it thanks Anna
so we wanted to get Chinese but my local
journey is a shot
which makes me want to cry inside a
little bit yeah tie instead and showing
out of my favorite tie mmm Anna's gone
home now and I'm going to unpack my
suitcase because I haven't done that yet
and I've been home for two days it's
just terrible so I'll see you guys think
on Tuesday see you then
hi guys it's Tuesday today and it's
about three o'clock now so I need to
stop getting ready because I've been
sitting with no makeup on all day just
doing some work but tonight I'm going to
a premiere which is very exciting I'm
going to see the film
what if which has Daniel Radcliffe in it
and it looks really nice it's one of
those kind of nice feel-good films so
I'm going with Keisha
I'm taking her as my plus-one and Anna's
gonna be there as well so I think we're
gonna meet first to some dinner and then
go I don't know what I'm gonna wear I'm
not gonna dress up because I'm not
exactly getting popped or anything no
one really cares what I wear it said on
the invite fun and flirty but I just
don't have clothes for this weather it's
like summer it's quite warm but it's
rainy my blisters on my feet from my
friend's wedding this weekend so I think
I'm just gonna go comfy and I don't
think anyone will mind so I need to do
my makeup I still have a little bit of
tan left from holiday so I don't really
need to wear much foundation these days
which is very nice I'm gonna use a tiny
little bit of Revlon nearly naked
because I'm really enjoying this at the
moment it's nice and dewy this
foundation is so nice to apply I really
have that feeling with a few foundations
where I feel like I should prefer
wearing it than wearing no foundation my
eyes I'm going to use the by Terry onre
black star which is like my favorite
thing for one I don't know what to do
with my makeup because they just got
this smudge it out and it's like the
nicest brown but I might put something
shimmery on top just to make it a little
bit more interesting they I'm just going
to do a like smokey eye big lashes nude
lip I'm not really bothered about what I
look like I just want to see the film so
I'll probably look pretty normal I
thought I'd test out a new mascara so I
tried this Iko sport waterproof mascara
which I absolutely love the packaging
for but I don't know if you could see I
think there is a little bit
you natural for this kind of look it's
not a terrible mascara I probably wear
it for like an everyday thing
but I think for going out I need bigger
lashes always end up going back to my
favorite Clinique one always okay
excuse the mess in my bedroom again I'm
sorry I just can't be one of those tidy
people I think this is what I'm gonna
wear
river island cropped top and Topshop
skort
because it's kind of looks like shorts
in the back so it's semi casual but got
a bit of leg out and then this jacket
which makes it look a bit like I'm
wearing a suit but I didn't know what
else to wear and some scruffy boots that
definitely don't go but that's what I've
got made it's Covent Garden it's still
nice and light out there kiss me again
and we're gonna go find Anna I think
we're having Jamie's Italian mmm I'm
hungry and I want me some Balinese green
