be back at vlogging this is my first
video yeah this is my first video of
2018 so I hope you all had a really nice
Christmas and New Year's
my first week back at work is quite
chilled in terms of I haven't got loads
of meetings and events and stuff I've
blocked it all out in my diary to stay
at home because today I think I get my
book page proofs which is when they
print out on like big paper in the
actual style that it will be in the book
so up until this point I've only read my
book in like a Word document format so
now it's going to be actually laid out
with like header and footer and any sort
of headers and titles and stuff like
that so I'm really excited / nervous to
see that this is the kind of last point
in which I can change anything and I
can't make any big changes so I really
hope when I read it back there isn't
anything that I think oh god why did I
write that or anything like that because
I think I can only make some more
changes now and people are starting to
read it in terms of like my management
team and stuff which is just making me
so nervous like knowing they're reading
it and then I do this annoying thing
like I'm really bad at taking a
compliment so my manager text me
yesterday say I finished I loved it and
like said with his nice things and I
just turned to rich and I was like I
think she's just saying that because
she's my manager I just can't take a
compliment I always like over analyze I
literally read through her feedback like
million times she was like it's really
nice how personal is so I take that as
like oh my god is it too personal I
think I'm just nervous but I'm also
really excited so I can't wait for the
page proofs to come today I said when he
bummed up I'm not ill I've made this
like ridiculous discovery laughs right
just before I fell asleep and I can't
stop thinking about it I basically been
waking up almost every morning
definitely for the last week but the
more I think about it has been quite a
long time I wake up every morning with
the most dry throat ever like you know
when you're ill and you wake up and you
you you can't swallow if I leave what
sound paper in your throat because it's
so sore I've been waking up like that
every morning thinking like oh I must be
a bit rundown on getting ill I'm getting
over something but then during the day
I'm okay and then last night when I got
into bed I started to feel like how to
drive through again and I thought maybe
it's something to do in this room and I
remember hearing someone talk about a
humidifier before so I started googling
I thought humidifier was to like take
away wetness and it really like make it
more Drive that's I realized that's like
a dehumidifier so I googled what a
humidifier does and when I started
reading about them I saw actually having
a room that is really dry can cause all
kinds of problems from like I saw dry
throat to itchy eyes and dry skin which
is exactly what I've been having for so
long I've still got such a sore I get
the driest itchy eyes I've got the dry
skin I've ever had like so much that
it's giving me eczema and maybe it's all
down to our new bedroom
let me put three got two radiators in
here which isn't loads but it might be
saying to do like the old carpet or the
old wallpaper I don't know but the more
I kind of think about it this room is so
dry and my throat is killing me so I've
ordered a humidifier on Amazon it's like
a really ugly one I tried to find one
that looked good looks good but I just
want one quickly so if anyone doesn't
know one that looks good the only one
find is the dyson one which is beautiful
but it's 499 pounds I ordered one on
Amazon for 30 quid so I'll be really I'm
going to use that one as I could test
her I'm really interested to see if it
makes a difference to my sleep my skin
and my throat I sleep with strepsils
next to my bed because I wake up in the
morning I throw it was so sore so that
is why I sound a bit bummed up and
that's my like revelation I realized
last night and I can't wait to see if
it's gonna help I'm just at home all day
today I'm gonna wait for those page
proofs to get couriered over to my house
I also thought in this video I would
talk a little bit about how I take my
Instagram photos and edit them and do
you like a little review of my Fujifilm
xt2 camera because I get a lot of
questions about it and I really really
like it I feel like I've had long enough
now to try it out and get to know it
that I can talk to you guys a little bit
more about it so I'll do that at some
point in this video we were trying to do
more videos like this in 2018 where it
is a vlog but with a point so I'll
always kind of pick something to do
within that vlog and that will probably
be the title and thumbnail but actually
most videos would be in this kind of
casual vlog style because personally
it's why I prefer watching and I think
it brings out the best in me when I'm
sitting down in that sort of static
environment I feel like I'm not fully
being myself rich is working from home
today which is nice because I'm not
ready to be left alone yet we need to
pop to like here and our luggage
because we bought some doors for our
wardrobe so if you remember when we
moved in we had to take the doors off
this wardrobe that was already here
because they stunk of Bo we tried
everything to clean it and it the smell
wouldn't go so we got rid of them
completely and then we've just had this
kind of open wardrobe but I wake up
every morning look at it and just it
just upsets me and I suddenly thought
why don't we just get some new doors
right here in the meantime and I don't
know like 30 quid each so he went last
night to get some doors and handles but
we forgot by the hinges so we used by
the hinges put the doors on I feel like
that will make such a difference this
room just so I don't want to see all my
clothes in there so messy and that's all
for today all right I'm gonna go
downstairs and sort through my emails
we've got a little working station set
up here and I've got my avocado on a
bagel
we have come up to my bedroom his riches
on a work cool downstairs I'm gonna take
an Instagram and show you how I do it
and I think I'll show you like a flat
Laver should not though I don't do those
that often and I tend to take more
situational photos I don't know if
that's a thing but my theme if I have
one at the moment on Instagram it's
quite like dark warm photos so I'm gonna
try and like a stick with that and I
feel like I don't like staged photos as
much every photo I feel like maybe
slightly staged in a way but something
that has more of a kind of life style II
real feel to it okay I feel like I'm not
making sense but I'm gonna take a photo
of my beauty desk I think this is my
desk it's just for Mike here one day I
want to get a really nice desk but this
one is good for now and it's not
expensive it's got a big draw that pulls
out let me know if you want me to do
some kind of video on this won't be that
interesting but I can do that
and then I've got a mirror and a few
things on here so I feel like I'm gonna
take a photo I feel like with the light
reflecting it will look really cool and
also with the mirror I like really
layered photos so with lots of different
things going on in the photo so maybe
I'll just set you guys up over here and
you can watch me take the photo and then
I'll do a little review of the cameras
wakens
when the traffic stop mode
there's a ghastly g'nort
down the canteen to fix it up so they
call you okay so as you saw there
sometimes it can take quite the while of
like fiddling about and moving moving
things around sometimes I feel like I
put things in place go sit the photo and
then realize it just doesn't work so
it's all about patience really if you're
doing a photo like that where you're
setting things up I don't know if this
is going to be the best photo ever I
definitely felt the pressure with
filming it but let me quickly talk
through this camera so this is the Fuji
film X t2 and I discovered this camera
through my friend Carrie her blog is
called wish wish wish and the reason I
wanted another camera because I've got
the Canon 5d Mark 3 which is one of the
best cameras in the world oh I
definitely don't need another camera but
I find that cameras so big that I never
want to take out with me and I really
wanted to take more photos when I'm like
out and about especially for my
Instagram so I wanted something that was
small and portable I had the Canon EOS m
but I was really disappointed with the
quality of it and how it was to use so
Carey got this camera and I had a little
play with it and I completely fell in
love and there are quite a few reasons
why I love this camera let's get the
obvious one out of the way it looks
great which is good when you're buying a
smaller camera that you're gonna wear on
your shoulder across your body because
if it looks good then it's not something
you want to keep shoving in a bag all
the time but it's not just because it
looks good it's a really easy camera to
use and it's made me like falling back
in love with photography it's quite
expensive the body was over a thousand
pounds and the lens I bought was about
800 I think so this is for proper camera
enthusiasts the lens I have by the way
is the 23 millimeter 1.4 so you can
change the lens which is really handy
what I love about this camera is all the
settings are external so you don't have
to like fiddle about with the back of
the camera to change the settings the
f-stop is on the lens itself so you
literally just turn it the f-stop is the
thing which makes like the background
fuzzy and you can decide how kind of in
focus or out of focus you want
everything in the background to be the
ISO is on the top here you can lock it
in place but you can just spin it the
shutter speed is also here so can you
see how all the settings are external so
it makes it really quick easy so while
you've taken the photo you can just
change the
this you don't have to then go in and
change the settings and then once you
find the one you like you can just lock
it in place so that is one of the main
reasons why I love this it's so easy to
use it's so easy to use I first teach
rich how to use it which is really handy
when it comes to taking photos of me for
Instagram and he really has no idea when
it comes to photography so if he can
learn to use this camera I think pretty
much anyone can it's very easy to use I
also like how it's got a digital
viewfinder which means that when you
look through the whole you're not just
seeing what's on the other side like if
the cameras off I can't see anything and
but when you turn it on it's like you
can see what the photo is gonna look
like I don't know if a digital
viewfinder is - everyone's preference
but I really have been enjoying it
because I feel like I can really
visualize what the end product is going
to look like so I absolutely love that
what else can I say about the camera I
got the one in graphite silver and black
and I'm just totally in love with it
it's got Wi-Fi which most cameras these
days do I find it so handy so when I'm
out and about and I've taken some photos
or I've just taken some like now I turn
it on I go to wireless communication and
then I've already got the app set up on
my phone you just have to download an
app and then you connect to the Wi-Fi of
the camera this is life-changing for me
okay and then I go to the app just
Fujifilm app I press browse camera and
it brings up all the photos that I've
just taken so you can click on them and
then you can go through and select the
ones you want I think I only took three
I tend not to take too many photos I was
look in the camera to see what's gonna
look like but I don't really take throat
until I know it's kind of in a frame I
would want so let me just download these
three photos this cameras just made me
like I said fall in love with
photography again it's so satisfying and
fun to use and this is pretty much the
camera I take all my instagrams on the
phone quality is fine it's not really a
quality thing it's more just because I
enjoy taking photos on this camera more
than on my phone and when you're getting
someone else take photo of you it's
easier to get a better photo on that
okay so those have downloaded the only I
would say is I don't think the battery
life is great on this camera that's a
little bit disappointing so now these
have downloaded into my photos let me
show you okay so these are the three
photos that imported these two are the
wrong way around so I'm just going
go to edit and rotate them so I can
compare all the photos so when I've got
loads of photos I tend to go through and
heart to the ones that I like because
when you heart a photo it goes into your
favorites folder so I've really got
three to pick from and I can normally
see well these two are quite similar so
I'm just gonna delete this one so it's
kind of between two and once I start
editing them I can normally tell if I'm
going to like it or not okay so the
first app I use is vsco and I import it
and then I click down here to resize it
so I go to crop and I do four by five
which is the size for Instagram it's not
square it's the bigger size and then you
can really see what it's going to look
like on Instagram so I will take that
and then what I normally do is go to
exposure and I'll turn that up a little
bit and then the filter I've really been
enjoying using there's all these
different filters and you can buy more
as well is c8 I think this came in a
package I think it brings out the blues
as you can see the difference I don't
know this is probably really bad filming
brings out the Blues it makes it a over
thing a little bit warmer as well and
that's kind of all I do I don't really
like to over edit my photos I like to
kind of rely on good photography really
and get a good photo then and there and
not worry too much about the editing I
don't want my photos to look fake in any
way so I'll save that one and I will
save it to my camera roll so I'm going
to do the same thing I'm gonna cop it to
four by five I'm gonna turn up the
exposure a little bit which just makes
it brighter there's all different things
you can do here you can change the
temperature if the photos a bit too
orange you can make it a bit more blue
you can change the contrast and like I
said I don't like to over edit but you
can if you like to this filter makes it
quite dark but like I said I'm quite
enjoying that at the moment I can always
turn up the exposure a little bit more
things I know already which one my
favourite is but let's save it anyway so
now I've got two photos this one and
this one actually I don't know which one
is my favorite there
actually I'll show you I do next which
sometimes helps me decide I use this app
called mosaic au which helps me kind of
plan out my feed I try not to over plan
but it's also just a good place to store
photos that you know you're gonna post
so like I know I'm not gonna post those
together but at some point I will so
I've put all my photos in there there
knees come in so there with all might so
the last photo I took was down here so I
can see what looks better so you can
move them around and then you can kind
of see what it looks like in the grid I
love this app though because you can
also pre write your captions so you can
write your caption here and say whatever
you want to say and then if you're out
you're busy at the time where you want
to place your Instagram you look sure
you just press this button and it posts
it automatically to Instagram basically
gives you the caption it's a copy and
paste so you don't have to let you think
about your caption and paste it it's a
really good tool I really like missing
okay okay I decided to go for this one I
think it's a better photo because it's
got the pillow in the background it's a
little bit neater this one I think looks
cool but it's a bit confusing on what's
what so this one looks like a better
kind of table seeing so I'll upload it's
a mosaic oh and I'll pre write my
caption and I'll probably post it in the
evening because that's when I know that
most of you guys are on Instagram I can
kind of tell by my analytics but really
that's all I do I think what takes the
most time is taking the actual photo and
thinking of what to take a photo of as
well when I'm like out and about and I'm
doing things it's easier because I can
just take photos of what's around me but
when I'm at home a week and I'm not
doing much as hard as to think of things
to take photo of but I do really enjoy
it quite frustrating how I feel like
photos have to have me in it to do well
or Instagram but this year I'm just
going to focus less on what does well in
terms of likes and think more about what
I enjoy taking photos of and posting and
I think that's what's really important
anyway if you guys have any questions
about this camera I hope that I covered
everything I feel like I didn't give
like a close-up of what it looks like so
this is what it looks like if you have
any questions about it let me know I'm
not a camera expert I'm just a camera
enthusiast and I love it I don't flog
with it because the screen doesn't
really I just don't like vlogging with
cameras like this the screen flips down
like that and I'm pretty sure do
anything else Oh turns don't me know
what that
I mean this camera the g7x canon g7x I
find is the best for vlogging this I use
the photos so yeah let me know if you
have any questions I'm gonna get back to
work my page proofs still haven't
arrived I'm highly concerned because I
only have three days to read the entire
book and add any edits and it hasn't
arrived yet let's hope it comes soon
right yeah how this bedroom because
everything's drying up just sitting in
here bloody wait for my humidifier to
arrive tomorrow rich has gone to Ikea to
get the hinges for the door so I'm
really excited to get back you probably
can't fit them until later I think it
depends on his workload
I just got sent the I think it's the
final cover of my book which is mad it's
almost finished as if you like tweaking
here and there I think I'm gonna
announce that sometime at the end of the
month maybe I'm just terrified but I'm
really happy with that actually it took
a long time to get it to a place I don't
think I was actually longer than normal
apparently this process is always like
this but I found it quite frustrating at
times I thought oh my god am I ever
gonna get somewhere that I'm happy I'm
really happy with it
I think it's I think you guys are gonna
really like it I can't wait to actually
see it printed on a book I think we're
gonna I get something called a wet proof
versus where I think see what it looks
like printed before I confirm just
looking at my hair in the camera now you
guys are saying that you love it longer
I've never had it this long and this
like healthy normally when it gets this
long the end bits getting really
straggly so I am liking having longer
hair but sometimes I do feel like it's a
bit like I don't know a bit I think I
might need to go for just a little bit
of a trim just to keep it healthy go
back to Harrisons maybe but I am liking
it longer this is what got for lunch
jack potato cheese and beans and which
has a potato with tuna okay we're gonna
go upstairs and well I'm not gonna do it
because I'm not much helped maybe I can
just hold the doors but it's gonna fit
the new wardrobe doors I've got them
resting up in here this is the Wardrobe
I just really can't stand what it looks
like open our old wardrobe was open but
it was meant to be open so it looked
better
we just got some really plain cheap like
here doors and yeah hopefully we'll make
a massive difference I can't wait yet
proper built-in wardrobes here I'm still
planning on doing a house tour and
explaining to you guys all about
renovation plans
I'm just waiting to the right time
Toyota come on he's waking slow and the
traffic stop move
there's a gas leak the northbound I
can't seem to fix it up so they call you
Monday
wow that makes such a difference to the
room you've just there were really nice
handles actually and IKEA but we rep the
dates for they're easier soft closing
now all my mess is just hidden away
behind nice white wardrobe doors and
this also will make me feel less rushed
about getting all new wardrobes and like
the rest of our room done oh my god oh
my god it's literally this is how big my
dissertation was it's pretty much the
same size look the F word in my NASA
video I like faked one of these I put
manuscript this actually is it this is
actually my book right okay I'm gonna
make it look good I'd gone with this
very exciting I'm still sitting here
reading the book I'm on page 83 and I'm
happy I think we're just gonna start
making dinner yeah I just want to
quickly take my makeup off before I kind
of get comfy for the evening sorry about
the loud noise we've got a really really
loud extractor fan in this bar too but
it's not the sort of one that you can
turn on separately with the lights on
this is on and it's so loud it's really
like okay think you're safe I was just
about to say as well as the loud
extractor fan which we're trying to
figure out how to change having got
anyone to rest my camera I think one day
when I do my bathroom I'm definitely
going to take into account to the fact
that I like to film in my bathroom maybe
have some sort of like shelf or
something for my tripod system but
there's many years away for now you are
wrestling on the sink
I'm just gonna have to bend down like
this but I'm just gonna do my little
evenings can carotene that I show you
and we start with my adobo and I use
that to take off my eye makeup then I'm
going to use my oski Renaissance
cleansing gel these three pumps are back
I put it onto dry skin
rub that all over
they do take care of my eyes but there's
mutually not much makeup left
so it kind of turns into an oil and then
I just let it sit on my skin for a
little bit I had an auskey a facial
recently when I went into the clean
Christmas party and I noticed that when
she cleanse my skin she left this on for
so long and it was really nice so I've
been trying to leave it on my skin
longer in the evenings usually what
other as our cleanse and then I'll brush
my teeth and go the toilet and do other
things while this is sitting on my skin
but because I'm taking my makeup off
before dinner I obviously don't need to
brush my teeth pull water and I think
I'm going to use some of the glossier
it's super bounce this is just nice
hydrating serum nearly finished another
bottle and I'm not sure I'm going to
reproach it's just because I go through
them so quick clearly doesn't feel like
I don't know it something about going
through products that quickly that I'm
not sure if I love I think if they made
them in a bigger bottle I mean I love it
I would definitely buy if she came in a
bigger bottle but it frustrates me I'm
gonna then to put on the zelans marine
complex and moisturizer because my skin
is so insanely dry in this cream is so
thick and it she'll have to like dig my
finger in to get out it's like kind of
interesting bouncy cream 4-wheeler like
really put loads on look at my skin just
like drinks up I mean if you can it's
good to do your skincare routine earlier
and evening like when you get back from
work the first thing you should do if
you can is take your makeup off because
then any kind of serums and creams you
know
skin I'm just gonna use the rest of my
hands and it kind of sinks into your
skin and has longer on your skin
basically than sitting at home and your
makeup will even new when you don't have
to do okay now my hands will look nice
and young too that's all I'm gonna do
tonight just cleanse serum and
moisturizer no acids I'm slowly eighteen
tonight okay it's quarter to ten I'm
gonna get to bed soon and try and get an
early night although I know I'm gonna
lie in bed and just watch youtube videos
until midnight but I'm gonna pretend I'm
getting an early night because I've read
quite a lot of the book but there is a
lot more to go I'm not really that fast
a reader and I need to get this all done
by Friday so I'm gonna wake up early
tomorrow and carry on with that and I
think I'm gonna end this vlog here hope
