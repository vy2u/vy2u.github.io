so I'm at the airport because today me
and Anna are going to Malta going with
MTV because it's the MTV Music Festival
on Wednesday slight problem has booked
not by us for the wrong time very very
late checking closes at 10:00 car cabs
in Compton 9 so I'm actually managed to
get to the airport in time somehow
I'm waiting on a she has five minutes to
check
I don't know just going to make it or
not and if you know we're gonna have to
get another flight later I don't know
what's going to happen
it's all right dramatic I don't know why
this is like the second time it's
happened to us we're very organized
because we didn't plan this so we're
both a bit stressed but hopefully she
makes it Anna's here because she
actually made it okay so we made it off
the plane it's fine we didn't get to sit
together because of these shenanigans
I was the back load right by the toilet
in the middle but luckily then I said
makes me off at the window-seat so I
said yes I had my tomato juice because
how do you know that tomato juice tastes
much better in India
I'll explain that story later and yeah
it was fine I read like half my books is
amazing we're now gonna go get our
pieces yeah yeah I'm sure they're happy
we made it my room is so nice to saying
it the Corinthian Hotel it's like a
five-star hotel on some Georges Bay
it looks amazing I thought I haven't
really like properly introduced this
vlog this morning was very stressful as
I kind of mentioned we nearly missed our
flight because of confusion with cab
times you're the last ones on by like a
second and then we have to sit
separately and you know you guys know I
hate flying so that's fine and now we're
here and it's so hot I think we have the
afternoon free so we're going to sit by
the pool and tonight free also Zoe and
Jen are going to be here and they are my
oldest oldest blogger friends Zoe was
like the first beauty blogger I ever met
and I have a lot to thank her for I
think she took me to my first ever
beauty blogger event and she kind of
opened my eyes up to the beauty blogging
world so I'm really looking forward to
spending some quality time with them
it'd be so nice to catch up but I'm
gonna unpack shave my legs and get down
to the pool okay I'm with some creamed
up ready for the pool and I wanted to
show you guys my new little Topshop
place suit it said then and place it and
I think it's very cute I'm also going to
wear my Hollister sandals guys look at
the view out my balcony amazing
oh wow an ins to hurry up and get to my
rooms I wanna go too
now were we on the hunt for pina colada
we just got pina coladas and pretty much
sitting by the pool I literally couldn't
think of anywhere I'd rather be right
now this is the life man with oh and
look at the sun's kind of going down
because it's nearly 6 o'clock but I have
no plans to move from this bed until
dinnertime
look who's joined us so we've come back
to the room now to get ready because
we're gonna go and find somewhere to
have some dinner
so Zoe's here with me taking the photos
and the Anna's gonna join us if we're to
get ready and go on the hunt for some
food
right back my room now and ready for bed
I am so so tired I just FaceTime direct
and it was really nice to see you stay
and I'm going to get some good sleep for
a nice relaxing day at the pool tomorrow
and festival so see you guys then
morning guys it's Wednesday day two of
Malta and we are heading straight down
to the pool it's early it's like half
9:00 we don't wanna miss any of this Sun
I think we might be having a meet-up
this afternoon which is really fun we
didn't expect to be doing that but
apparently lots of you guys live in
Malta so we definitely want to meet you
here's Anna looking great she can have
beach wear time for breakfast
you
so I've just come back to my room to get
ready for tonight and I'm just dancing
around my room to music if I'm honest
that's what I like to do when I'm alone
in a hotel room I think I'm going to be
wearing this to the festival this like
Topshop kimono everything river island
strappy top and Topshop denim shorts
I'm not feeling small when I'm in hot
climates I just want to be cash I
definitely want to come back to Malta
and see it properly we've only really
had a day and we just wanted to chill by
the pool if I'm honest because we never
get time off and it's so nice just to
relax for one day but I want to come
back and see it properly so it's on my
list of things to do
so me and Anna came to our little meetup
expecting one or two people and all
these lovely people came thanks for
coming
that was completely insane I can't
believe we literally tweeted like 10
a.m. this morning and there were so many
people they were so nice and thank you
if you guys came we've had lovely time
sitting in heavy cocktails with you and
who knew so many of us Ivers lived in
Malta we had such a nice time that was
such a fun I remember if I was to speak
I'd say exactly this thank you for
forgiving okay so now it's time to head
to the Isle of Malta MTV festival which
is why we're here I'm so excited I have
my wristband for the VIP section and I
think there's an after party as well
that we're going to be getting a boat to
so this is what I'm wearing and river
island top I copied Anna these are so
handy I got it in black and pink and my
new Topshop shorts and I'm wearing my
Hudson boots I know it's a bit hot for
boots but they are comfy and apparently
this festival gets busy so I don't wanna
get my feet trampled on my kimono forgot
my kimono I don't want to be are you
ready to party tonight
I'm running the body's a nice
I don't have to be on your ready to
party tonight

box within a box

two-seater bites on my face as a
souvenir though but seriously we had
such a nice time in Malta it was a very
short but sweet visit I definitely want
