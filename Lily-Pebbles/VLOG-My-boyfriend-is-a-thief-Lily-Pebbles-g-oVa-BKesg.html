today is my out today I've got five or
six meetings most of them are with Anna
it's gonna be a busy day
we're gonna go go I've said it I need
them so bad so bad and it like onion but
so what do you think of your first
eyebrow really my shitty palette on a
very long time away
when I was 12 young Beth I caught my
brows off I think that you can get it
yeah
they do it doesn't it read it in the
camera today oh no eyebrows are done a
little bit red and sore but we're off to
a meeting number two ran out of time so
we're getting the cab please we have
like five minutes
I completely forgot to vlog for the rest
of the day but I basically just came
home and had dinner and chilled out and
now it's bed so it's Thursday evening
now I've been working all day and me and
Richard just decided that we're gonna go
out for dinner tonight there's nothing
in the house so we're gonna make a
little bit of a date night and I think
we're gonna meet at chicken shop which
is one of our favorite places I much
prefer it to Nando's I hate Nando's and
I know a lot of you were going to get
upset by that comment but Nando's gave
me food poisoning for a good couple of
months it really like properly destroyed
me and I haven't been back since so I
have just been doing my hair I've
actually curled it a little bit using
the Daniel Harris and curlers and I
don't usually use tongs I'd normally to
use my straightness because I'm a bit
scared of tongs but seemed to work quite
well definitely practice makes perfect
so I'm just going to get ready and then
we're gonna go for dinner
why is there always so much talking on
the radio I spent my entire time in the
car
flicking between audiences Victor does
that annoy anyone else eaters we've gone
on a date night and finished and it's
still light outside we do this every
time and they had an argument it was
like intense debate
how do we solve this problem what's the
name leave it I'll come back to find it
surely that's a more better idea and
leave it there and then they'll come
back to the place where they think
they've lost it you take it home they're
definitely ever gonna find it no you can
throwing it off oh bloody hell this is
like when you found that phone oh my god
rich is such a do-gooder many fans of
ours phone ones indeed phone go to and
they came back in our long thing are you
gonna phone the card people yeah she's
probably card a card got a new one
already been like anyway as I was saying
before we found the card we finished
dinner it was so yummy we'd shared half
a chicken and butter lettuce and avocado
salad and chips it was really dark in
there so I couldn't really film but it
was so yummy I definitely recommend
going to the chicken shop in Kentish
Town if you haven't been already why did
the really face on your feet I need to
pee pee on it no it's not the right
music
it's basically ice we were just in the
street we just found someone's card on
us on the side so I just wanted to let
you guys know
I'll bet she lost them 20 minutes on
hold and then I wait for five them
please II tried it you try to really pop
up and are you thinking god no receipt
trying a different number
this one's for free of Maybelle's a
little petrol icon is being pinging
every time I get in the car so better go
get some petrol
so rich is gonna tell you guys about
what happened with the card I want to
know as well so I've been in the shop
there wasn't really that much to tell
she took the details of the card she
took my name and I try to get my mobile
number cool and just find out David kid
reporter dastan but don't think she'd
reported it stolen or missing or
whatever so you stole it didn't steal it
I have to cut it up now back to cut up
okay chill-out time watching Hollyoaks
what you eating
oh it's the chocolate that a subscriber
sent to me from Germany so thank you if
that was you which is thoroughly
enjoying it you're watching the
Eurovision and really we're flicking you
were not like not to be put in the
Eurovision you know probably what's in
it it just came on and it's just so
rubbish you turn it down a bit
I mean we're watching Island I'd happily
vote for Island but rubbish so
understand why your vision is never ever
gets better not like the other days
makeup on makeup off I have been loving
this stuff again I've properly got back
into it best evening time it's serum
night it's Friday and rich is working
from home today and he's on his lunch
break so we are both sitting here
watching these little ones because
they're very entertaining
mother of the Year award right here okay
quick carpark vlog I've just popped out
because today I'm actually gonna buy a
new vlogging camera the one I'm vlogging
on now is the Canon X's 230 and it's
actually a really great little camera
I've been so happy with it I think Zoe
recommended it to me about a year ago
and I loved it the battery lasting power
is amazing and the focus is good I
really like it does make it a little bit
of a clicking noise when I'm vlogging
like this quite quietly but I thought
now that I'm vlogging more regularly
it's a good time to kind of upgrade so
I'm gonna be getting the canon s120
which is because casein a stat if you
don't watch my new cheap he's great and
he said it's like the perfect camera so
it is a little bit more expensive than
this one but I've been like selling all
these I've been like selling old cameras
and stuff to save up for it so really
looking forward to getting it and giving
it a try it's about 20 pounds cheaper on
Amazon but I think when you buy cameras
and Amazon you have to buy like a
warranty separate so I'm gonna get from
John Lewis which is I think the cheapest
place in store to get things because
they
that never knowingly undersold thing and
it's 420 pounds more you get like a
two-year warranty thrown in
so the nice thing about having other
friends who also work for themselves is
that I went to meet my friend Jake for
lunch she's here and now we're having to
go to PC world to get my camera because
the place I went didn't have it in stock
and you know when you want something I
have to get it today
they said they can get it tomorrow but I
cannot wait so we're going to PC world
so I'm gonna get this hard drive because
mine broke and then this is the camera
that I'm gonna get thank you canon s120
the guy said it's like the best camera
ever I'm just unboxing the camera and it
looks so pretty I just realized I
haven't actually told you guys if you
noticed that I'm talking funny in any of
these vlogs because I recently got
braces you can hear when I say s I've
got a little little bit of a lisp
because I'm getting used to them I got
braces on my top and bottom they're the
clear ones you can't see and I can take
them in and out I meant to keep them in
all the time apart from when I'm eating
and drinking I'm using a brand called
clear guide and I'm actually going to do
a blog post on my experience when I'm
like halfway through the treatment so if
you are interested in knowing about that
keep an eye on my website for now I
apologize for the annoying list
hopefully it will go away as I get used
to it
it's normally when I'm wearing top bond
if I take the top one out see this is
when I'm just wearing the bottom one and
you can't really notice as much but it's
my bottom teeth that really need the
work so I can kind of if I don't want to
have that annoying voice I can just wear
the bottom ones and it's fine because
that's kind of where I need it the most
but when I'm at home like now I like to
wear both so kind of I go straight to my
front teeth at the same time so anyway
I'm charging the battery for my new
camera and then I'm gonna have a little
bit of a play so me and rich decided to
head into town for a bit
so we're going to add hmmm home and IKEA
prefers my bedroom needs clearing out
and I need some storage stuff so we're
on our way in central London to go take
them home
hmm what is the world come to
we can't excuse the awful morning look
but I forgot to end my vlog yesterday
basically just came home and had dinner
but this morning it's Saturday we are
going to be sorting out our bedroom
because at the moment it looks like this
I need to redo my whole bedside table I
am gonna get rid of this and put
something else there and it's just a big
old mess so I'll show you guys as we do
that oh by the way I'm vlogging on my
new camera how is it is it good tell me
first task is to clear up this area area
cleared so this is what the rail looks
like I've got this hanging thing to put
some bits and then this is for scarves
and I'm putting my bags here and I'm
sure it will look all lovely when it's
done these are some of the things I
bought yesterday in H&amp;amp;M home I bought
these two and this but I'm gonna do a
whole post on like redo my bedside table
so look out for that on my website Lily
pebbles - how do you say okay we've kind
of finished up now I've sorted out my
bedside table and we've put up this kind
of like clothes rack and I've got my
bags on the side and I'm gonna continue
