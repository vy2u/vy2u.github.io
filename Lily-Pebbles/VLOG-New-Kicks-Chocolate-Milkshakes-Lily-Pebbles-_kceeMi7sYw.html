is actually coming around and staying
the night tonight so I've made her some
dinner I thought it seen as rich as away
on a work trip and my parents out I
thought I would make me naina a romantic
evening meal in so I've actually made
some gazpacho soup and I'll show you or
take you into the kitchen I've made a
spatula soup if you don't know what it
is it's like a cold tomato soup so that
has been marinating in the fridge for 24
hours in this bowl here and it's
delicious so I'll show you that when she
comes around and what else have I got
I've got some chicken wings and chicken
legs which I like to eat them cold
so I cook theirs earlier and I need to
make a salad
looking forward to eating the gazpacho
soup is so delicious and I'm going to be
putting the recipe up on my blog I've
taken photos of the whole process of
making it so it's really easy to look
out for the recipe I think it's going up
sometime next week
Allen's here now hello and I've just
served up this healthy dinner so I'm
interested seeing if you like the seat
or these chicken looks I feel like I
should blow it it's weird
I mean she's like yeah I can't eat so
she's going for a third not so
apparently I'm a very bad house host and
what started as a nice evening making
dinner for Anna has ended with her
rearranging all my beauty cupboards
because she's so shocked at how
disorganized they are so we're gonna
carry on with this and I'll probably see
you guys tomorrow we're being
interviewed which is very scary I'm very
nervous about that and they're gonna be
talking about youtubers and stuff which
is pretty cool so I'm glad that we can
help out and I'm gonna carry on with
this and then go to sleep
morning so we're very early it's like
11:30 always been up for a while now
which is having some porridge and lots
of fruit and maple syrup
so we've done a little news piece have
been doing it all morning and it was
really fun it's been scary at first but
it was fine it was really fun just took
what what we do so Lucy and Anna are
gonna head off now and I need to film a
video I think if it is a for all time to
film and it looks like I have a little
guest joining me on the safer behind
cheeky doggy
she's very sleepy today
right time to edit right guys I'm gonna
sign off now because I'm just getting
stuck in with work and I'm just gonna
have dinner tonight and it's pretty
boring but it's bank holiday weekend so
hopefully I'll be able to vlog a little
bit and that's all for today morning
guys so rich is back from Germany and we
have no plans for this back holiday
weekend so we're just going to go with
the flow I think today we're gonna go do
it shopping either Selfridges or
Westfield
I think we did we design itself goods
yeah and which has a list of things he
wants to get
this English weather really winds me up
in last week's blog it is nice and sunny
and today it's pissing down with rain so
we just fight round rock the street got
soaking wet but we had a nice little
motor on Selfridges
I forgot the beauty projects running at
the moment they've all that cool things
going on and like beauty stuff and Mac
have these like giant lipstick stands so
we had to look run there and I think now
we're gonna hit the night to town
because we're still on the hunt for
Rich's trainers this is the only thing I
bought in Selfridges I bought two of
these juices which I absolutely love the
broccoli pair spinach kale kiwi lemon
and banana
so we've decided to go out for a very
early dinner if you want to stay in
tonight and we know that once we get
there we'll just be too tempted to get
take away so just come you're gonna be
the dirty burger which is what my
favorite places for burgers and rich is
happy with his new trainers
absolutely delicious exactly what both
of us needed this chocolate milkshake is
so good we're gonna head home now and
have a chilled evening in our pajamas
doing nothing so I'll probably see you
guys tomorrow
morning guys that Sunday morning I'm
going to start the day with some egg and
banana pancakes
so on our way to Staples because I
desperately need some new stationery go
in and take a look open range I'm
looking for is mark the Stuart range
because Anna always talks about how good
it is here it is and it's minty
gooeyness but I'm getting a Martha
Stewart notepad so Mike page dividers
tip X and some new pens that was really
nice we just had a quick lunch with my
best friend Hannah she made like salad
and all these yummy foods that was
really nice so around and we decided to
head to South Bank cuz there's no nice
and life things going on there and we
can take a nice walk in the sunshine
which has taken me to this cafe that he
thinks is really good a parent
so I've had a really nice walk along
South Bank and we're gonna go have some
dinner back in Albion where we had
coffee earlier because the menu look
pretty good so that's all for this love
you guys enjoyed it and I'll see you
