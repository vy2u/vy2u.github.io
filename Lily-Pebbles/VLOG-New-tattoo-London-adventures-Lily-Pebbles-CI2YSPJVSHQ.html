a couple of weeks off blogging because I
had some other videos to post and some
kind of personal events that I didn't
think I'd really want to vlog but I am
vlogging again now and you haven't
really missed much I had my friends
henrique end which you saw my getting
ready video for and I also got a tattoo
done at the weekend which is very
exciting so I did take my vlogging
camera along so I will insert the
footage here hi guys so it's Sunday the
15th day and I'm going to hit the camera
on the roof hi guys so it's Sunday the
15th and I'm feeling slightly sensitive
today because it's my it has been my
best friend's hen weekend and so a
little bit hungover very tired but I'm
on my way to get a new tattoo this is
going a 5th tattoo I am going to the
family business which is where I got my
last one I would definitely recommend it
in Exmouth market it was really good
I'm going to get a tattoo I just decided
this week to get it I'm very excited I'm
not sure I'm going to be able to film
actually having it done because they're
quite strict they don't even let you
bring someone in with you but I will try
and film a bit while I'm there
this is Exmouth market and it's just
down here on the right here it is
okay so I'm out tattoo place now I
couldn't really film it's so crowded
with in there that you hardly take
someone in with you and I'm in quite a
lot of pain right now it was definitely
the most painful tattoo I've had yet
I've now got five tattoos I think
because of where it is slightly under my
arm and he said it's a really sensitive
area and the skins very thin and
stretchy so he has to put the needle in
like extra deep which is why it hurts
also a bit hungover and whoa what about
to crash into that boss also I'm a bit
hungover and apparently that is not a
good thing to do when you have a tattoo
which I knew but I didn't want to wait
any longer
so it's stinging a bit now it's a weird
pain though having a tattoo doesn't make
you want to cry it doesn't make me want
to fade it's just a bit annoying makes
you want to grit your teeth together so
we're now going to the pharmacy to get
all the bits that I need for the
aftercare
and I'm just going to chill out tonight
and I will show you guys my tattoo when
I start this blog next week and you will
see what it looks like when it's all
clean this is what it looks like all
wrapped up we can't really see actually
eat there you go so I just took off my
dressing cuz the guy said after four
hours to take it off here they clean and
put one on and it may be a little queasy
said I'm having to lie down and Pat it
dry with the towel this is definitely
the most painful tattoo I've had but I'm
still happy I got it
so obviously please don't say anything
if you hate my tattoo because I got it
done for myself but I'll show you what
it looks like now it's been two days and
it was definitely the most painful
tattoo I've ever had I think because
where it wasn't my arm and I was a bit
hungover but even without a hangover it
hurt a lot afterwards as well and
yesterday on Monday it's feeling a bit
better now that it's still bit sensitive
I'll show you what it looks like you
probably can't really see because it's
under my arm I have two arrows under my
arm covering won't explain why I pretty
much just like they look like and I like
meaning etc etc so the reason why my
hair looks revolting and greasy is
because although I'm in every
this week working today I'm out because
I'm going to get a Brazilian blow dryer
at house of rush in Piccadilly Brazilian
blow dryer I'm getting the Nano keratin
treatment so it's basically like intense
condition and it just gets rid of any
frizz so although I will look ridiculous
for the next four days with dead
straight hair I can have my normal
looking hair after that it just means it
when I go on holiday this summer it will
be easier to look after and less frizzy
so I'm going to take you guys with me to
get my hair done today so I'm now in the
rush hair salon got to get my hair done
is so nice and here then we are
definitely recommend coming
so the stuffs on my hair now it always
really stings my eyes but it will be
worth it I think he came on through four
hours and then blow-dryer
so this is the finished thing it's
obviously very strong like I said it
would be because I have to leave it like
this three days and also watch it
because if you tie it up apparently the
Kings stays there forever
so that's petrified me I'm not going to
tie it up anytime soon oh I'll let you
guys know how I get on I might look a
bit greasy over the next few days so
home now I was in the chair for about
three hours my eyes are still burning
the stuff they put in your hair stings
your eyes so baggy and then when they
blow dry it in it hurts so much it was a
really long process but I've done it
before and I know it's worth it it makes
my hair so much more manageable and gets
rid of all the frizz so when I am a
holiday all this would be so easy to
look after
well easier the only annoying thing is I
have to leave it like this now for three
days it's gonna get really gross and I
look really weird with like dead
straight hair but it will all be worth
it in the end I also picked up these
products which are shampoo and
conditioners by this brand re enhance
you have to use sulfate free shampoo
conditioner which I do anyway because
it's better if your hair but these ones
also carry on working the keratin
treatment as well so you need a tiny
amount so I'm going to give them a go
morning guys it's Wednesday and I was
just straightening my hair because you
have to keep it straight all the time
when you have a Brazilian blow-dry it's
just making me cry again smell of this
stuff really burns my eyes so that's why
I look like this I was working up at
half seven this morning by John Lewis
delivering a freezer I had no idea was
coming so that was fun
and Dixie's home from her little trip
with the dog carer guy she is fast
asleep under my bed today it's going to
be a run errands and film day I need to
film a couple of videos and it's here
the post office my teas go to the
beautician so I might vlog a bit today
right off to the post office I think it
might be slightly ridiculous how much
post my family gets okay I am set up for
filming I have dog sleeping one light
there one light there camera here and
I'm going to sit in front of this window
normally I wouldn't suggest having the
light behind you but I've been sitting
here filming recently and
kind of quite like it me as long as you
have enough light on the front of you as
well it kind of works okay one video is
done and I think we might do another one
because I am going away so I kind of
need another video done so that when I
get back it's not a masterís right now
this thing needs to go in my computer
and we editing for about three hours
right editing is making my brain go
fuzzy so I'm going to go downstairs and
have an early lunch I picked up these
things from Sainsbury's for lunch that
look quite good they're like this one's
a chow mein
you
so it's quarter past six now I'm still
working rich has just left work so he'll
probably be home around seven ish then
we need to take Dixie for a walk because
she hasn't been out all day so it's my
sister's birthday tomorrow and one thing
you always have to give your older
sister if they have babies with their
present is a babysitting voucher always
have a good run good shake
Dixie's a Tibetan Terrier by the way in
case anyone's wondering but we keep her
hair cut and like puppy cut cuz when
it's too long it just gets too dirty
morning guys it's Saturday and it's such
a nice sunny day today
rich is on his way back from a bike ride
he left at 4 o'clock this morning so I'm
just writing him a cold bath because his
legs are very sore and me and my parents
are looking after my nieces and nephews
today so I'm not sure what we're going
to do might go for a picnic I thought
I'd show you what I'm wearing this
t-shirts from Zara I really like the
print and then these shorts are from
Topshop and wearing short shorts in a
city is always a bit weird but it's
going to be hot so I thought if I wear
trainers with them wearing these then it
makes it less kind of like leggy maybe
my tattoo is healing nicely it's at that
itchy stage but um it's doing well I
wish I could show you properly I might
get rich when he's back to film it so I
can probably show you that's kind of
what it looks like from the back but
it's it's under my arm so you can't
really see it and I said go at that so
I'm in common guard and we decided to
not help my parents with the kids
and becomes calm garden rich and we're
going to do some shopping and run funny
but first walk to walk mmm car comes
calm guard and not have a Shake Shack
we're now making our way over to South
Bank kiss and he's gonna be a little bit
quieter the common garden is very busy
on weekends
sky obviously you guys know rich is
really into biking and he's cycling
around the world do it
especially de Paris yeah I don't reckon
he's going to stop there so you're like
a website for super psyched Amanda good
luck
rich just so you know you're not
actually allowed to like around the
world I won't thank you
anyway took my cycling no no fair so
we're gonna get on Boris bikes now

place

sister and my other brother in law and
we're going to have quick bite to eat
and then go to the roller disco jam
excited but everyone has to change their
outfit but my happens I'm still short

that way it
apparently I like a cowgirl because I've
got no check shirt on now so we just
demolish the dirty burger Carly and Ben

I had a pathetic meltdown because I got
home realize I left my camera
yesterday's flat and I have so much to
do tonight edit this whole vlog because
I'm actually going smarter this week
which is very exciting and going with
Anna and I think Zoe and Jane are going
to be there as well so I will be
vlogging this week in Malta and I'm very
excited but I have lots to do had a bit
of a funny day I know it's looks really
fun relaxing my family but my video
didn't go down too well today and it's
always a bit of a shame when that
happens and I always get a bit upset
when there's kind of negative comments
which I shouldn't do but you can't help
it
specially visit weekend so I'm going to
get on with work tonight and I think
with my style guide videos in the future
I'm not sure what I'm going to do with
them because it's difficult to make them
relevant to you guys I need to do them
ahead of the season right at the
beginning but to make them genuine to me
I kind of need to do them when the
seasons happening so think about those
but maybe I'll adapt them and change
them next time around maybe I'll skip
the summer one because I guess some is
happening now and I wasn't going to do
that one to August I don't know anyway
I'm just going to edit this vlog now and
then I will be going to Malta on Tuesday
so I'll start blogging them thanks for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
