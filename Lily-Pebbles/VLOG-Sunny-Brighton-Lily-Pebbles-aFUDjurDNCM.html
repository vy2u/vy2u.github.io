been doing some work this morning it's
like midday now and it's so sunny in
London you don't understand any of you
who aren't from like the UK when it's
sunny we get so excited I'm currently
wearing like shorts and a t-shirt
because it's so hot in my house and I've
got loads of makeup on because I just
took some photos for a post I'm going to
go edit those photos and write the post
do like a full day's work today and then
tonight I might be doing a workout with
rich and then this weekend we're going
to Brighton with Anna and Mark and I'm
so excited it's going to be so sunny and
so much fun so I'm going to bring you
guys along with me
I've got that funny feeling and I'm so
excited to brighten I just need to Pat
for names so it's bright and early it's
actually a really beautiful morning in
London it's already sunny and it's like
7 o'clock we are on our way to Anna
marks I'm gonna pick up Anna and we're
gonna drive down to Brighton and I
thought to tell you guys yesterday that
rich and Mark actually bike riding from
London to Brighton yes they are insane
but they need to practice for their big
bike ride to Paris in September so I'm
gonna give rich a vlogging camera and
let's see if he can vlog along the way
already in his biking getup the universe
knows excited I'm really excited we're
here others and the boys are just
getting ready for the ride looking sexy
in their biking gear
we're now about to begin
what London to Brighton
we just did to him I wasn't so bad him
worse so we made it to Brighton oh my
god you can hear the seagulls ready we
got to Anna's parents place and her mum
had made us lemon drizzle cake
she knows my favorite I love her lemon
drizzle cake so we had some of that and
now we're just gonna walk around the
boys are still making their way here on
their bike so me and Anna kind of have
the day to mooch
see you later on trying to decide when
to get this hat or not I've never really
had a hat for they pretty much scare the
life out of me like I like this one
what you guys think but time you want so
I probably would have got it or not got
it but this is the today's
I literally couldn't think of anything
I'd rather be doing more than sitting on
a deck chair right and peer in the Sun
with this one with me probably the best
I've had in a very long time
so we've just been having food and hymns
for literally hours of you sitting out
there and I saw my cousin Jesse's here
this is lovely to catch up to she lives
in Brighton and now we're gonna head
down to home lawns because apparently
there's some familiar faces down there
so I'm gonna go say hi
it's Carrefour and we finally found the
boy is they made it to pricin how you
like feeling
so here in the park chilly lovely times
they're not done setting and so he's
attempted juggling pressure didn't work
that was so nice we just chilled there
for a while and now we're heading back
to Anna's to have a quick change of
outfit before going out for dinner I
think they're having okay just heading
out for dinner and I thought I'd quickly
show you my outfit change I'm still
wearing my leather jacket and this white
tee is from Topshop and then these new
trousers from Zara and I absolutely love
them
they've got an elasticated waistband so
they're very comfy and my Bertha sucks
so we're ready
dinner work delicious and now ungrateful
so we're going to look it up clown is
awesome cake
majorly tired I think it's time sleep
morning so apparently in Brighton you
get woken up by seagulls I don't know it
rich and mark all morning people so
they've dragged me out of bed to do at
workout I really can't believe I'm doing
this I'm not a morning person so this
one wearing my usual workout gear and it
is sunny so it will probably be quite
nice Mark's not coming that was hard
the Sun was hot I'm very sweaty and
majorly looking forward to breakfast
dressed and ready for Sunday I'm annoyed
and bring more summery clothes but I
didn't know how hot it was gonna be so
I'm just wearing this white t-shirt from
last night and my river ID and jeans are
putting on my sandals and I have some
and other stories sunglasses somewhere
may go away my hat again and like this
hat right back yet hope lawns to have a
nice little walk along the beach down to
Brighton
I'll be high
things are getting a little bit hungry
around these parts so we're gonna go
find somewhere to have lunch shopping
bites and then they have this print that
I've seen s-stay blog about before from
ham and it's nice collar as well so
Esther day I can lots of you and I saw
this now in a book shop and I'm gonna
get this for my friend Esther day it's a
really cool book so we're about to get
into the class drive back to London and
I've had the best weekend it's been so
nice and sunny so I hope you guys have
enjoyed watching this listen slog and
I'll see you all in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
