early because today I'm heading over to
Anna's we have three videos to film so
it's going to be a pretty intense day so
I just need to start on my hair and then
I'm gonna head over to hers so I'm here
now at Anna's and I'm just gonna get
ready to start filming our first video
right Anna's off to get some lunch while
I'm gonna film my may favorites video I
think gonna be something yummy so I
finished filming my may favorites video
and oh my god it is so nice to film in
anna's flat lighting it's so peaceful
I am mega jealous I think I might just
come round here and film all the time my
house is normally full of kids screaming
and it's so dark I'm just waiting for
her to come back with some lunch and
then I'm gonna film one more video for
her which i think is a cooking video
it's going up in a few weeks and then
we're gonna like have some lunch and
chill
I'm now gonna film Anna's recipe video
and she's ready with her butter in case
you ever wondered why me and Anna are
friends it's for this reason right here
so I can lick the spoon when she picks
me case you ever want to know how he
gets smooth videos this is Anna's boob
cam so he finished filming Anna's video
it went really well you know so half of
me not to laugh with that camera on and
the whole camera shakes when I do so
that was quite hard but that lemon juice
of cake is so delicious this is what it
looks like and they're just gonna take a
pretty photo and then she's gonna let me
finish my slice desperate but that's
kind of all for our filming today bye so
I'm back home now and everyone's out
tonight rich us our parents out and I'm
home alone so I'm gonna have a vampire
diaries session and eat all of this
yummy sushi and seaweed salad so I'll
see you guys smile hi guys it's Thursday
and I haven't vlogged today cuz I've
just been working but I just had to pop
out to buy a new pair of jeans because
one of the downfalls of having a dog is
that she breaks into my bedroom and
finds whatever piece of clothes we might
go in the floor and eats them so I've
just popped out to buy a new pair of Lee
Topshop jeans plus another pair because
I really liked the Jaime's that have the
rips in them so two new pairs of jeans
thanks to Dixie destroying my other
jeans
okay time to do my makeup and I were
quite a bit more makeup when I'm filming
just because there's so many lights it
tends to kind of wash me out for today's
video I'm gonna be showing you what's
new in my bathroom so all the products
I'm currently testing and what I think
of them so far so I finished filming and
now I'm going to go edit write one video
is edited and lunch today is going to be
leftover meatballs and Christmas from
dinner last night
okay so I've done a full day's work now
and I think I'm gonna go watch a little
bit of Vampire Diaries before rich gets
home and we're gonna have Thai takeaway
tonight morning it's finally the weekend
and rich left early this morning like
five o'clock to go on a crazy bike ride
with mark and I'm going to spend the day
my family we're going to the foodies
festival it's going around London and I
think it's going to be in Kenwood House
today so we're gonna go and eat lots of
food
right so I'm back now from the foodie
festival and it was so good I would
definitely recommend going if there if
it's on anywhere near you I so much food
I'm feeling really stuffed and tired now
but me and rich are going out tonight to
some friends but dinner I'm not gonna
vlog because it's dinner and maybe a
vlog tomorrow hi guys it's Sunday and I
wasn't gonna vlog today because we don't
really have much planned but I realized
that you haven't really seen rich in
this vlog yet which is sad alright okay
where are we going now
the food festival so I'm going back to
the food festival where I was yesterday
because rich didn't get to come and I
just know that he would love it
hopefully they're gonna let us come back
in with the same tickets we're gonna
give it a try
fresh apple juice what's the like we've
just demolished some of I can't
pronounce this
I say paella baby boy hiya
it's delicious Tereza and chicken and
now I think it's time for a crown for
ice cream did you get
pretty good forget the best time I've
had this nitrogen ice cream
it's really cold isn't it we're just
walking from Kenwood to Hampstead high
street and it's beautiful weather
feeling very peaceful thoroughly
enjoying this walk you feeling peaceful
feel relaxed just having a bit of a
geeky moment look at these amazing trees
they're like hundreds of years old I
actually love walking through camera
didn't Heath look how beautiful so we're
still walking we're just gonna head back
to the car and then go home and just
chill this afternoon so think I'm gonna
end
flogging now cuz you're probably all
bored by now but thanks for watching and
I'll see you guys on Sunday for my next
video bye rich</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
