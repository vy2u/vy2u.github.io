trying to find the perfect one and this
was the one I liked the most which is a
really random one it's format helen e
cosmetics and i got it in my Valentine's
glossy box so yeah I'm gonna put this on
on my nails I have C arte it's a navy
blue is called like peril women or
something like that and then Topshop
rose gold I think moonshine and little
dots Anna Anna did this manicure the
other day and I thought was really nice
so I did the little dots I think that's
quite kind of chic looking so yeah what
I'm gonna get dressed and then I'll show
you guys what I'm wearing to the party
nothing crazy I'm not a really kind of
dressy person I don't really wear like
dresses or heals so it's kind of my own
normal style but my most top and jacket
so I'll show you that this is my make up
if you can see there's a really kind of
orange light there so it's probably not
showing up at all but maybe I'll try and
film outside when I can yeah I'm gonna
get dressed and I'll show you what
wearing and it's you just had to turn
down my music I've katy perry like
blaring through speakers okay so i still

planning my hair down like that I'm
gonna wear this bag which is from monkey
and it so I'm basically wearing all
black and wearing black skinny jeans and
boots and then this black top which is
from Nets and it's got the carcass
outfit in the front and then under the
cutout bit I'm wearing this necklace
which i think is Aurra and it's got lime
green in it so it goes the bag so that's
the plan kind of like that and for a
jacket I'm wearing this one which is
