thought I would vlog I might not have
enough stuff today to vlog about so I
might vlog tomorrow and the weekend as
well and just mash up into one vlog
haven't quite decided yet but I fancy
doing a vlog and I've just finished
filming my what's in my bag video well
half of it which I should have seen on
Thursday hopefully if things went to
plan I've got my camera set up here and
my light and I'll show you my background
because for people who don't have the
fancy white backgrounds this might help
I've actually closed my curtains in my
lounge put a light up because there's
too much natural light it was a bit too
bright and this is my sofa and I've
actually just put fairy lights I've put
my bedspread or like my bed stuff and
loads of cushions and when the cameras
on me there's kind of blurry in the
background I think it looks quite nice
so just put lots of textures behind you
that's my tip if you want to kind of
create a full background so I've got a
busy morning I need to go into town and
I've got a meeting with Anna and then
we've got a PR event for Charlotte
Tilbury the new range and then I'm going
to come home and do some work and yeah
I'm going to try and blog over the next
few days so hopefully we'll enjoy this
okay I changed quickly and now I'm off
into town I will show you what I'm
wearing when I'm there because I'm
meeting Anna and hopefully she can fill
my outfit any when I get to take some
photos office outfit
you see my sign was a lie there's no
reason
on the street and I've gotta cook into a
super drug because that is the best one
it's always really quiet and now I'm
gonna go like 15 minutes spare and then
forever 21 if I clean in there literally
right here this is really nice that's
actually like summary stuff so I'm gonna
wait to get room up and then go there
and do a bit of shopping there's
actually some really nice stuff I'm
gonna go to winces now I'm on South
Water Street and when it goes to whistle
is to see if if anything spend my 25%
off voucher on probably not though
so I went into whistles but couldn't
really find anything I like I feel like
it would be still so expensive uses with
25% off and there's a really nice
sandals but they were 225 pounds which
is crazy and I went space and Cape have
a look and now we've just finished our
meeting and it was really nice had lemon
drizzle cake and a carrot apple juice
which just made me really happy and
we're now going to Charlotte Tilbury is
launching a new collection we're going
to go have a quick look and then I'm
going to head home so it's just now
hotel right let's go to the launch
nicely the bathroom is what I'm wearing
today by the way but Anna just did some
alpha photos of me so you'll see it on
my blog
you can't
so just come out of the shower Tilbury
event as you can see I'm wearing quite a
lot more makeup she just wanted to show
like all the products on my face so I've
got quite a lot of eyeliner on but you
put it's really nice and she just kind
of smoked us through a new collection
and sure I'll be talking about them soon
on my blog or somewhere so look out for
that now I mean Anna just gonna go try
find somewhere to eat I'm back home now
I've already changed into comfy clothes
and tied my hair up it's like 3 o'clock
and I've got a lot of work to do so I'm
going to sign off for the day and I'll
probably log a bit tomorrow in the
weekend as well and put it all into one
and yeah rich is away on a work trip so
I think I'm going to be working all
night to make up for being out this
morning but I'm pretty happy with that
and I'll see you guys tomorrow morning
so today is stay at home and work all
day kind of babe
just checking back in and I have done
seven posts I've taken photos written
them scheduled them and I am now having
a cup of tea and half of ours bar and
then we're gonna carry on who it's 7:00
p.m. on Friday and I've ticked off
everything on my to-do list today so I'm
going to sign off for the weekend and I
am going around to my friends house for
dinner tonight he is making dinner for
me and my parents because our parents
are friends
long story we've known each other
forever so we're all going to go to
dinner together it would be really nice
and I'm gonna go and get ready I've got
my makeup on already from this morning
so I'm just going to do my hair a bit
get dressed in some isn't pajamas and go
quick thing did anyone else weird like
me and tie their hair in like really
tight I've put like two ponytails really
tight with a hairband because sometimes
my hair is like too straight and it
creates a bit of waves without having to
use the straighteners and add more heat
just a little thought let me know if you
do that too it works on my hair
so had a really nice dinner and now I'm
home rich just got back from his work
trip to the mo areas and I'm gonna go to
sleep but I'll see you guys tomorrow
morning it's Saturday morning and it's
nice and sunny today I don't really know
what our plans are yet but I think we
made for a walk and go for lunch and see
where the day takes us
okay we are off I need to drop those a
sauce parcel at my local news agents to
be picked up which by the way I think
it's very cool that you can return a
sauce packages so easily we are going to
go out for lunch to play some Greenbury
infrared he'll just business
the supermarket we found quinoa milk
what the hell what's next is soy or
almond quinoa Duncan that sounds from
all signs and rituals to try I'm wearing
outfit of the day my red bands on and my
jackets from ASOS my t-shirt is Uniqlo
men's and then my jeans I was about to
throw them away because they're old but
I decided to cut some slits in them and
now I quite like them again and then my
shoes are boomer and my bag is Topshop
just getting nasty with the camera my
nail polish is Jenny it's a new spring
color so we're leaving Primrose Hill and
we are on the hunt for something called
spaghetti squash because I saw a recipe
on beautiful message is a blog that I
love for a pizza base made out of
spaghetti squash it looks really yummy
and healthy so we are gonna go find a
spaghetti squash and then head home for
tea because we couldn't find any
spaghetti squash apparently it's pretty
hard vegetable to get hold of so we're
gonna try and making courgette or
zucchini base instead sorry I'm chewing
gum and see how that goes which is just
got into the bike shop and now I had in
home
all right just having some family time
in the garden and the kids playing rugby
yeah what is that
throw away boy pick up stones
the Sun is beating down like raindrops
the making holes in the ground I planted
flowers outside
by this afternoon like so many nieces
and nephews and family and stuff here
but I mean rich it's quite early and we
need to go out and like eight and a six
o'clock now so we are trying to make our
pizzas and we have the courgette pizza
base in the oven no idea how it's going
to turn out and we're just cutting some
toppings some mozzarella now and I'll
let you guys know how it goes and if it
turns out all right the pizza base to
have been in the oven for a little bit
and apparently now we put the toppings
on the filler this is gonna be a fail I
decided to I think they're just gonna be
like Sh'ma she and that's just how
they're gonna be but they might taste
good I'm gonna put some of this pizza
topping because we're too lazy to make
our sauce tomato pizza base Sorella lots
of pepperoni few pieces of peppers
that's Richards your next idea I might
look so much more splattered oh I think
I'll put too much of something on does
that leak get over the side this is
actually taste really good it looks
awful but it tastes really yummy
I just demolished that fake pizza it was
really yummy I definitely make that
again do you got yours rich yeah so
tonight we are going to my best friend's
mum's 60th birthday party because my
parents are friends with her parents
like the whole family going the big
family affair and so I'm just getting
ready my hair looks a mess because it's
greasy and I haven't time to wash it so
I've just piled a load of dry shampoo in
it and it's looking a little bit crazy
but I think this is what I'm gonna wear
I'm wearing my faux leather leave jeans
from Topshop and this top which is from
Urban Outfitters and I'm wearing it over
a little top that has like a little
collar because always let me see through
and I thought that's quite nice little
detail and I've just kind of piled on
makeup on top of what I had already so I
might take a few clips when we're there
but I think this might be the end of the
vlog because I don't think everyone in
this party it's gonna want to be in my
vlog so I'll see you guys tomorrow and I
hope you've enjoyed today so I think I'm
gonna take this clutch bag stressed but
well dressed I think it's the first time
I'm gonna get to wear this
thank you for that good morning it's
Sunday oh I have morning voice I hope
it's working yet today it's meant to be
really sunny today so I'm really excited
I'm going to Covent Garden to meet my
friends Gemma and Deb's for lunch and I
might get there but early so I can do a
bit of shopping I need to pick up some
Bioderma desperately and I'm just trying
to side that's where cuz in London when
it's sunny you never know how warm it's
actually gonna be because in the shade
it's quite cold
so the moment I'm wearing my jeans with
the slits in and this t-shirt from hero
and cape which I got years ago but I
love it because it's like the perfect
link and my hair is up because it's last
day hair and nice wash it's night and I
think that's about it for now I'm going
to go downstairs it makes is everyone
I don't
so I drove around for about half an hour
trying to find somewhere to park cooking
garden I forgot how hard it was and
there's loads of single yellow lines
that should apart on a Sunday so they're
all taken so I think usually live around
here and work right here but then I
realized that the shops are open till
12:00 anyway so 11:30 and I just have to
park in a car park and all you not
Londoners will be very shocked by this
but for up to four hours it's 17 pounds
I should've got a tube but I just take a
week on the weekends I like to drive
as you want it to be don't keep having
one of those days where everything I try
along doesn't fit but I'm giving up but
in during 22 spa
don't we've come to pick anybody wear
anything and then you put your sticks in
a little cup like this and they count
your sticks and that's how you know how
much expense so which is having a been
waiting for Gemma Debs here cuz there's
good and there's pain so if I got
dispatcher Cod fake and goats cheese CH
tuna and some kind of pouncing and all
it a little bit so good
it's always been you sweet
so we finished lunch and there's lovely
to me and then I went and bought some
Birkenstocks I've no idea why I was just
thinking about how I used to have a pair
that I really liked and then I still
make Instagram photo and so I just went
and bought something because there were
30 quid right so it's quite cheap so I'm
quite happy about that and now we're
going to lab organic because Gemma wants
to get a juice I've never been here I'm
really excited about this
think about sunny weather is I allow
myself a ninety-nine flake or a 250
flake they're just getting a Benz cookie
which one you get in
I'm a milk-chocolate go
yeah let's forget on
so I dropped the girls off at the
station they needs to go to and I'm now
making their way home I think that's
everything for my vlog the sweet candor
since Thursday so let me know if you
have enjoyed this kind of vlog over a
few days and I hope you all had a nice
weekend too and I'll see you guys soon
it's always better when you sing sweeter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
