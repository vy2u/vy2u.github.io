by itself and wearing Miley jeans and my
white converse which I'm a little bit
obsessed with they're so pretty and
white I just went outside today some
outfit photos was rich and it's actually
a lot colder than I thought it was it's
sunny but freezing so I've changed into
black boots and I'm gonna take her out

like put for a nice makeup okay I think
this is what I've chosen for my makeup
Giorgio Armani luminous up foundation
Bobby Brown makeup forever concealer
save the glory bronzer Becca blush kevin
Ekron sculpting powder and highlights I
think hourglass powder
I'm just gonna see as I go but hourglass
eyebrow blink brow clear brow gel
Topshop mascara and then this Too Faced
chocolate bar palette which I'm still
kind of testing out and looks like this
I completely forgot how amazing luminous
silk is I haven't used it for a while
and it just makes my skin look so glowy
and fresh
okay makeups done and nine sort on my
hair okay I think this is what I'm gonna
wear my leather leaves again which I
really don't wear that often parently
only one over log and this cocky green
shirt that I got from Topshop or Zara a
long time ago but I quite like cocky
green on me and yeah it's pretty simple
I don't really know what shoes I'm gonna
wear
it's just rushed me out the house it
definitely was
but we're on route to my friend Ben's
house we're having pizza and pre-drinks
and then we're going to East London hi

been like a granny for about a month so
looking forward to seeing everyone and
having some drinks
in the bathroom oh god I sound drunk can
we do that back I don't know how to blog
when I'm out because it's dark noisy and
no one else was doing my videos so I do
I would never try that I might stop
vlogging today because I feel like I'm
getting drunk and I'm gonna embarrass
myself hey Jemma the I hope you guys
have enjoyed today mark after you're
tired no morning guys it's Sunday and
not gonna lie I'm a little bit hungover
I mean I should drink that much it's
more tired hungover but we had fun when

and lotsa latte it's a pretty simple
makeup okay so we decided we desperately
needed a full English breakfast of

they wanted to go and they said yes so
we see mark and Ana again today because
well we just really love each other and
I'm gonna go have a big juice and
breakfast and that's gonna cure my
hangover I'm really excited
