Birmingham you are balancing on a water
bottle and there is no light the Sun is
kind of just rising so I'm sorry that
I'm very blue today is an extremely
special day that I just had to vlog
mainly because I want to watch it back
I'm in Bermuda because this is where I
went to university I graduated from
Birmingham City University around 7
years ago I think it's where me and rich
met and first year 10 years ago it's
where I started my blog which obviously
then started my youtube channel a few
years later and it was a massive part of
my life I'm sure you guys have heard the
story before but massively failed at
school never ever got a single-a at
school ever tried for uni somehow got in
and went study marketing advertising and
PR at Birmingham City University and
once I got there I realized it was
completely different to school you cool
your lectures by the first name I was
actually learning something I was
interested in and I absolutely loved it
I ended up getting at first and started
my blog and kind of going on to work in
marketing which a few years later down
the line as you guys know starts my
blogging YouTube full-time so my uni was
like a massive part of my career story
completely unknown to me I was never one
of those people that thought you have to
go to uni to get a job which obviously
you don't but it was such a huge part of
my journey I've been back to my uni a
few times to give talks and stuff
because obviously to them I'm like a
massive success story because because
they literally encouraged me to start my
blog and I'm now doing it full-time and
they really like to show me off as like
a end product of what you know could
happen if you do this course so I like
to go back and talk about my little
story my job and everything like that
and quite a lot of my viewers go to the
University they either they're already
or so many of you messaged me daily to
say that you've gone to Birmingham City
uni to do the mapper course because of
me so that is amazing so this year 2018
my University you've invited me back to
award me alumni of the year so I'm going
to the actual graduation ceremony and
you know you go to a graduation so many
there's like a few people sitting on
stage I'm gonna be one of those people I
have to sit on stage and then after
everyone's got their graduations typical
I then get
with my own certificate and a pin to say
that they've chosen me as the alumni of
the year I can't believe it like they
just pick one person from each was it
good like the business school they just
picked me it's completely mental I have
a massive mix of emotions
it feels very nostalgic to be here like
on graduation day I feel incredibly
proud of myself my younger self would be
so shocked
I feel like slightly embarrassed so many
of my friends Muni are doing amazing
jobs as well a hundred percent would not
ever accept that I am the most
successful student from my year at uni
that's just absolutely not true but I
think in their eyes I am a success story
so I'm very very grateful to be getting
alumni of the year I can't believe it I
have to wear a robe and a hat and
everything it's so weird because me and
rich on the way up here last night we
stayed in this hotel the night before we
were talking about our graduation day
and we stayed in a hotel and we were so
excited and we were so young and I found
some photos and videos that I just
thought was hilarious so I'm going to
show you guys this is I think I'd like
just going to blogging so I'm taking
some hilarious like mirror selfies but
this is the dress I wore to my
graduation day I'm gonna put it up on
the screen it's from Topshop and I
actually still have it now just as like
a memory but there's no way I would fit
into it it's a white kind of floaty
dress or with really thick black tights
and then it is black boots they all look
like my legs just go into my feet and my
hair was insanely long I found this
really funny video of us getting ready
in the hotel room now I hadn't started
my youtube channel at this point so I
was obviously like practicing or
something or just filming a video for my
family but I'm gonna put the video in
now because it's hilarious I said to
Donna and she was like dying
graduation day we're in our hotel that's
me you rich it's in his pastrami
sandwich ticket Zaru
you see my dress it's nice that's all
for now my favorite part of that is when
I'm like this is my chest you like it
I think it's nice my voice is so young
here is a photo of me and rich in our
gown and our hat looking very smart and
very very young and then I just got
loads of photos of me walking on stage
my parents are too cheap to buy the
official photos so they made me stand in
front of a blue wall afterwards so they
could try and replicate the official
photos that she's hilarious but we went
out after this little our friend that
night and it was just such an exciting
day and I feel like we're doing it all
over again like to come back here but as
alumni of the year and be sitting on
stage I just I can't really get over it
it doesn't really feel like me I feel
like I'm doing this all for someone else
it's very strange but like I said I'm
just so proud of myself I really am and
to be doing it the same year is I'm
bringing out my book and stuff ten years
on also to be coming back with rich when
we met uni and now we're married Richard
literally like he's my plus one he was
like if one person asked me what you
knew I went to I'm gonna kick off his so
no he's coming back as my plus-one he's
also in a great job so he should be
proud too we talked a lot about that on
the way up he's gonna kill me he's
downstairs having breakfast and we're
gonna be late so just got ready I had no
idea what to wear I don't wear dresses
and heels I just really really didn't
want to so I'm just wearing the shirt
and black trousers and make you Chi
loafers I feel like hopefully they're
smart enough no-one's gonna Chuck me out
hopefully but there's this whole like
routine of what I have to do Lenny Henry
is the Chancellor he's going to be
presenting the pin to me and I've got to
go up and stand adjacent to the thing
and look at him and shake his hand and
walk back and I can't remember any of my
rules I'm very nervous I have to go
understand reception waiting for Rich
he's just got to get some stuff from the
room I'm gonna check out a really close
was saying like right by the
roundabouts last time when we came from
graduation we stayed at the Radisson Blu
I really remember that and we could walk
there but it's a bit of a miserable day
look how smart rich looks in this suit
go for the no Tyler what a rebel my lips
were absolutely fine yesterday and today
they have swollen so much around the
edges literally that's like over lip
fillers this is the Revlon Ultra HD lip
color in sand okay now we're just stuck
in the car park come on Lady we're gonna
be so late
ah we're just driving to bored Street
which we didn't get a broad street that
much as much as other places for like
nights out but we used to go to walk
about a lot
they had like themed nights that's when
we started pop golf but and I think we
have a massive argument because you
shouted it because I would get down a
drink yeah we're at the ICC just heading
inside
guys I am wrote they have fancy velcro
now instead of pins this is my robe this
is my hat
I'm terribly terrible at measuring so
this doesn't fit me it's too big nap in
it was literally hasn't sent me at all
which is slightly worrying can I walk
the stage have been let's cool off so
funny in this slide where the cat again
and we're gonna go have a cup of tea we
just met the vice-chancellor very nice
man
all the students downstairs well I
wouldn't do it around everyone's like so
excited so funny I feel like I'm
dreaming that year this will be back
will she like the same basis
so I just had to run through stage
prevent of our laps and now I'm doing
just keep like slipping out those happen
to be upon the students lockers which is
very cool in everything that one out
there and now we're just waiting to be
doing on stages and how much
lemme have a little photo and now we're
getting ready to go down so I thought
I'd play you some of the speech again
mainly just because I want to watch this
back when I'm older our Birmingham City
University alumni of the Year scheme
recognizes graduates whose achievements
and contribution to the community have
been truly outstanding Lily pebbles
graduated with a BA Honours in marketing
advertising in public relations and
today we recognize her as one of our
alumni of the year in the category of
enterprise and innovation the world of
social media blogging blogging etc
etcetera may be fairly new to some of
yours yep I had to stand right at the
front of the stage it's at this point
where I start to die in this little bit
of embarrassment
I'm sure it's actually part and parcel
of daily life for many in the room here
but Lily here is one of the biggest
names in that field with her fashion
beauty and lifestyle posts attracting a
phenomenal and indeed appreciative
audience Lilly launched her blog back in
2010 as part of her degree here at
Birmingham City University in the module
on digital marketing which was in the
third year of her degree program in
marketing advertising and public
relations I know it's back because this
lady here is Charlotte Cary and she's
the one who made me start my blog the
blogs remained very personal to Lilly
however and if you look at it you see
it's actually deeply professional but
also incredibly personal to her in her
life and also has a life has changed and
evolved over the last several years so
indeed as a Content broadening from
fashion beauty tips to wider lifestyle
themes such as home decor food or even
sort of simply day-to-day life in London
and indeed beyond she was one of the
first people in the community to use
Facebook live when it launched which led
to actually be mentioned by Mark
Zuckerberg himself apparently fantastic
what a result as the industry computers
continues to move forward however and
petechiae such a rapid pace it remains
to be seen what the next big thing is in
online communication and the world of
vlogging Instagram Facebook etc but one
thing you can be sure of is that Lilly
will be at the forefront of it so it's
great pleasure for
me to invite the Chancellor to present
the commemorative parchment to honor
Boehm City University's alumni of the
year Lily pebbles
okay I'm back addy wrote that was I mean
I literally mentioned in my last vlog
that I don't take compliments well I had
to stand at the front of the stage what
they did an entire amazing speech all
about what I do and everything I was
literally like I didn't know what to do
with my face I'm so embarrassed
did I look embarrassed no funny and then
you're in the brochures
this is the brochure and there's a photo
of me a little bit about me so funny
wait let me show them my pin what I got
okay so I've got the certificate which
is rich holding in this fancy fancy tube
and then this this is my pin hey we are
just leaving
I met a couple of viewers on the way out
which is really nice I'm also they've
given us our photos I'm so happy oh my
god I have to show you guys these
me what does it afraid I just find like
photos like this so for me just admit
how to fake smile I've learned over the
years because of my work which does
about of Facebook actually yeah you just
can't smile on on demand genre we need
to go home what does it work to do but
I'm gonna go via Paper Chase because I
can't find those photo albums anywhere
in London if you follow me on instagram
you'll know I'm looking for these
specific photo albums I think they've
discontinued but maybe they have some in
Birmingham the one in the boring is huge
so I think so pretty sure there is a
Paper Chase maybe I'm gonna quickly do a
google in case I'm in Paper Chase that
they don't have them guys want to look
in the back for me look this is what I'm
asked if anyone sees any out but in a
four
this is like square I forgot to vlog
because I was having such a nice time
but I went out to the beauty workshop in
Selfridges say hi to my friend Rohit who
is watching my Nana's and Caroline's and
Evelyn's videos for ages but we've met
him a few events and were pretty much
like best friends now
and he worked in the beauty workshop in
Selfridges with our friend Rose as well
oh my god he gave me this this is like a
massive I hope it doesn't get in trouble
for this I think he's a lot I'm pretty
sure gave me like a massive bag of Sarah
ridden dr. jart moisturizer samples like
this sized samples of my favorite ever
moisturizer I'm gonna take these
everywhere with me all the time I'm so
excited Thank You Rohit you are the my
favorite person ever we're gonna head
home now oh it has been a crazy day
we're gonna drive it's like two hours to
get home traffic in the car home also if
you're watching peaky blinders more on
that in my February favourites I think
cuz I've got a different one for this
month but being back in Birmingham I see
in a whole different light also Brahmi
accent
peaky blinders have totally made it sexy
bit awkward because we're seeing mark on
Saturday I've just come to my mom's on
the way home so you guys could see the
pictures properly this is me and rich we
think that he looks like he's my dad or
something because I'm dressed up and
he's not it's very weird this is the one
that they gave me in the frame it's just
me and then where's the one of the three
of us ego good Lenny Henry I just came
back for my parents were a lot my post
gets sent and I got sent miss from
Charlotte Tilbury it's the brightening
Youth glow trying to figure out what it
does there's anti aging color correcting
and glow booster I think it's like a
primer I'm definitely gonna try this out
because I love Charlotte Tilbury stuff
so that's exciting I'm back home now
just had a shower and washed my hair and
I'm gonna end the vlog because I have
lots of emails to reply to and lots of
work to catch up on and then we're gonna
figure out dinner but I had a really
amazing day it all feels like a really
bizarre dream I hope this is interesting
