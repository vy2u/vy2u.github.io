and as I'm sure you guys are aware
tomorrow is Valentine's Day and I'm not
gonna lie I'm not the biggest fan of
Valentine's Day I've never really
acknowledged it more than just giving
rich a card but for the sake of making a
fun youtube video I thought it would be
nice to do Valentine's three ways so
hopefully there's gonna be something for
everyone here no matter how you are
spending Valentine's Day I'm gonna have
a desk to date option where I will
recommend products that you should take
to work with you if you're going
straight out on a date after work and
then got a really simple easy pasta
recipe if you are staying in with your
boyfriend and you just want to make an
easy meal at home which is probably what
I'll be doing and then I've also got an
option for if you are staying home alone
or if you've just got some girlfriends
coming around and I've got some kind of
pampering treats to show you so let's
get started with the bits that I
recommend you should pack into your
clutch bag before going to work if
you're going straight out on a date on
Friday night for Valentine's Day please
liddie procom I can't bear those so the
first thing that usually needs topping
up is my concealer and I love the Make
Up For Ever full cover concealer because
it's really covers so you don't need to
touch up your foundation you can just
use this in any kind of red patches or
blemishes if my eye makeup has faded
I'll use the Kiko eyeshadow stick just
to touch up underneath the eye and in
the corners and because this is so
creamy you can just apply it and then
blend out with your finger and it just
kind of adds that smokiness back in
that's faded throughout the days she is
wearing my blusher is always the first
thing to vanish from my face so I'm just
going to touch it up with my Max Factor
miracle touch creamy blush and this you
can just Pat on with your finger and it
just adds a really fresh flush to your
cheeks yes I think a pretty pink glosses
perfect Valentine's and this new one
from Urban Decay is in love child and
it's just really pretty and glossy and
brightens up the whole look and
never-bird
finally if my hair is looking a bit flat
I use the orb a dry texturizing spray
just in the roots to give my hair a bit
of oomph and texture and grits and it
really makes a difference
no good with loves then spritz on some
of your favorite perfume that makes you
feel good Minds eccentric molecule
molecule one Oh No you've let it show
reading they're relying upon my face is
if our
and not even night you know just why the
wind is taking so if you're staying in
with your boyfriend and you just want a
really easy simple but delicious meal
this is one of my favorite pasta dishes
and with a little bit of help from my
mom because I couldn't film and cook at
the same time I'm going to show you how
easy it is to make yes so what you'll
need for this recipe is some spaghetti
olive oil to courgettes Parmesan chilies
and some garlic I like to start by
grating the parmesan into a bowl because
this is the most boring part that takes
quite a while so just great a lot of
cheese into the small bowl try to sing
another turnover good
just then it's time to cut up the garlic
it's easier to peel the garlic if you
smash it first with the knife
no good with love sons
please don't
lady once the garlic's finally chops you
can meditate your courgettes and just
cut the ends off you can use a box
grater to grate the courgette but we
couldn't find us so we used our food
processor which is very quick and easy
to use
please when the courgettes are all
grated they should look something a bit
like this
I can't bear the way now it's time for
the chillies and you can't use a fresh
chilli we've used in frozen ones because
they're really easy and they don't sting
your eyes so we just used one on a
spoonful add some olive oil into your
pan so you will come spring when it
comes to frying your garlic wait till
the oil is hot but be very careful not
to burn it because it would taste really
bitter and horrible and once it's
bubbling like this you could add in the
courgettes mix all the causative well
with the garlic and then you can add in
the spoonful of chilli and mix again the
trees down killing any son of girl
and a meal
the sideshow yes I'm here waiting for
her side
a third while Cosette is cooking lightly
you can start doing the spaghetti later
try to sing
jeanna record um just don't forget to
add salt into your water because it'll
really make a difference in the taste of
the spaghetti
No so while spaghetti cooking go back to
the courgettes which should be nearly
done now and quite soft and added all
the parmesan and mix it up the more
parmesan the tastier I think you've read
it shall we eat in there real add as
much salt and pepper as you like
and not even
you know just why
the wind is taking me anywhere but where
I try and I'm waiting for okay so now
we're ready to serve and you'll see that
it looks like quite a plain pasta
there's not that much sauce to kind of
spread it around because it's such a
strong flavor with the garlic and the
chili it really don't really need it and
you can add some extra parmesan on top
to make it extra delicious now I
absolutely love this pasta and we didn't
try to sing to no record
just me
me
no good with love sons
please don't let April come I can't bear
the way she looks like she's
so if you're staying in by yourself or
having friends over giving yourself a
DIY face mask is a really nice idea and
I've posted a recipe for it avocado and
honey face mask on my blog so I will
link that down below and I'd really
recommend trying it because it made my
skin feel amazing and glowing and soft
it's also really kind of fun to do work
on an avocado face mask put on like a
really trashy DVD as you're sorted for
the night but also if you want to do
at-home manicure I think that's a really
nice idea especially if it's a Friday
because then you kind of give yourself a
three day nail detox over the weekend so
these are the products I'd recommend for
giving yourself an at-home manicure
board roll one second nail polish Arisa
a nail file Sally Hansen gel cuticle
remover a cuticle pusher backer the late
and any hand nail cream OPI cuticle oil
and the dr. Lu and Brennan L nail
strengthener yes we're now the trees
down killin Anissa I've also created an
anti Valentine's Day playlist on YouTube
so I'll link that playlist down below
and it's full of pretty much 90's angry
Alanis Morissette songs which is just
right out my street as the nights coming
to an end run yourself a really nice hot
bar light a candle use your all-time
favorite bath products mine is the
therapy bath salts because it makes me
sleep like a baby and just relax and I
think that is the best way to enjoy
Valentine's Day personally I really hope
you've enjoyed this video something a
little bit different for me please
comment below and let me know how you
are spending Valentine's Day this year
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
it and I'll see you in my next one
alright
me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
