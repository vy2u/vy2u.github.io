the LA vlog I didn't vlog yesterday
because I thought I'd have a little day
off but we actually had a really busy
and fun day
one thing I have to tell you about
yesterday we went to this lunch place
called Mara Chino farms which is
opposite the Grove and it's a sandwich
place I don't even like sandwiches but
my uncle recommended it he's like the
god of LA food apparently and it was
amazing I had pulled pork sandwich and
Lucy had pork belly Vietnamese sandwich
and we did half half and oh no the pork
belly one especially it was insane
amazing sandwiches to definitely go
there if you're in LA today we have a
fun day planned because we're gonna go
to the beach which is like a little bit
further out but I feel like it's a
different part of LA that I definitely
want to go see we are seeing one of my
friends who lives here and she's gonna
take us there and we're gonna have lunch
and then later this afternoon we're
meeting up with Sandra who is a youtuber
that me and Anna have loved for ages
Anna especially has literally been
watching her for years she introduced me
to her like three years ago and we've
been watching each other's videos for so
long so it'll be so nice to finally meet
her she's so sweet she's from Canada but
I have a feeling she's like lived in LA
because she seems to know her very well
so I'm looking forward to catching up
and hearing about why she knows so much
about LA and probably gonna do a bit of
shopping together as well
so we just went for lunch in this
amazing like green towns beautiful
restaurant and it was so so giving that
Ricardo and salmon on toast and I loved
it up there was really I've never been
anywhere like that and there's a pool
and be like secluded and then we found
this shop dancers with hook a tow hook a
tow and it's got just everyman metaphor
and I bought this marble daily like
diary of venom is amazing marble phone
case it was only for iPhone 6 but but it
one of us have together it's just
beautiful and I basically just don't
want to leave I think we're gonna go to
Koreatown now hopefully the house east
of there because I know Alan loves like
Japanese Korean mysterious
what's with the stars we've now come to
I shall have no idea where we I think we
should actually go to like the kool-aid
oh all right where are we now we're in
the arts district in downtown LA thank
you
and we found a big version of that shop
we were just in so we're really excited
about that
just walking around it's like party area
and there's so many different cool
wounds look like you're painting a
graffiti on we just stop in every wall
so I take pictures I love this area oh
my god look see
we just found yeah we just found a shop
and had loads of mascara Zanna bought -
yeah but apparently that's the way the
volumizing one and the length we want
and they use them together using
together use lengthening or you might
even want to do for the top amazing
amazing I'm sure Anna will be raving
about it she loves it and then we'll
never be able to get our hands on so we
left a doll that was such a fun day and
we've now taken an uber well we did uber
pool it was great yeah you were hoping
we're gonna meet some really cool people
but uses two girls who spoke perfect
English but chose to speak in another
language which i think is so rich and I
just don't wanna hear that the whole
journey so that was disappointing we're
now in a bikini which just feels like
the cute still like ever really cute and
we just stroked past the lemonade it
allowed people recommended lemonade or
hair all in my face oh well so we're
gonna go and sit down get a lemonade do
we and then we're gonna be Sondra
so we've met up with Sandra now looking
beautiful and we're just walking around
and I realized this piece video my Z of
Byron Bay and Australia which is why I
really like it so chilled and like hippy
pride and we've got a couple of hours to
dinner now so we're gonna walk to the
beach I think if you haven't seen the
beach yet on this trip
since I'm just taking us to this like
beautiful canal is right please very
quietly it's really peaceful but it's so
pretty this doesn't feel real
we're still waiting for me for dinner so
we've made like a stop fukin lemonade I
didn't have one last time so I'm having
the most delicious lemonade I've ever
had
he's never this trip this is the most
delicious thing about being at old
fashions which I don't what does that
mean it's like this cocktail they have
it all the time in them no I know the
cocktail I didn't know what the lemonade
like oh okay
and you've got that's that one so good
it's a new day and we are having
breakfast in our room because we haven't
got much time this morning and as fill
me to get ready with me video and then
we are means pack up cuz we're headed to
Anaheim today we leave in about one and
it should be about an hour half two hour
drive hopefully and apparently VidCon is
absolutely crazy and then we're gonna
get there I'm gonna film Fleur as soon
as I get there desperately try and
upload it because apparently the
Internet is terrible you imagine a huge
hotel full of hundreds of people trying
to upload videos it's like a bit crazy
and being a pig this morning and I got
french toast yeah I think we're all
packed up and we're gonna head to Trader
Joe's to get some snacks because we've
heard there is absolutely no decent food
in Anaheim it's just I hop and I love
junk food and the green room food isn't
great and you know me and my food I just
get hungry so we're gonna go stock up on
some food and yeah I think we're all
packed up our both our cases are really
full and overweight so hopefully we'll
be allowed on the plane there are no
local Trader Joe's snacks and drinks
done
and we're now officially in Anaheim and
we're gonna drive past is Neil and I
wish we could go we don't have enough
time
look Disney does Disneyland right
we're in our VidCon room we have a big
bed each this is very different from
before
we'd have to share a bed now it's very
exciting we have our like passes and
I've just got ready because I'm gonna go
film the flirt in her room in about 20
minutes and then we're going to go and
explore and everyone said it's very cold
in the convention center so I might take
my leather jacket with me which just
feels wrong I'm wearing jeans feels
weird when it's so hot outside but I'm
excited to see what's going on is like
the most bizarre thing I've ever been to
there's so many people and youtubers
everywhere I started making videos
thinking I was like I was like I don't
have anyone else does this whole video
thing on YouTube comes about something
that is there's like thousands of people
it's so weird I've completely forgotten
to vlog because we've been in fleurs
room for like over an hour now filming
cuz we helped me a lot so yeah we have
two videos for me in flow and then two
videos for an offer and in fact I have
chosen to do like the most complicated
videos as well so the taking pages but
we're kind of nearly done there's just
like one bit left to do okay well I
never fill in the rest their video I'm
gonna quickly try and edit because mine
and flowers video needs to go up in two
days time or like even a day so I
haven't got much time to edit that so
I'm just gonna do that now we're in a
bit of a rush but we're ready and we're
gonna I think grab some food before
going out to a party tonight we'll just
stop cool I haven't changed either
that's lovely now which is like a secret
clue to her and full of idiots about the
people I think these plugs really
freaked me out
I feel like they look like this we're
gonna go up dinner we're finding
somewhere
there's not a great choice around here
they were going for the steakhouse we
finished at dinner and I me and Anna
heading to this party but we're kind of
on our own and don't really know ready
we haven't even started the party so
we're gonna see if we could find anyone
else holding a vlogging camera because
that means they're probably heading in
the right direction and currently in
Downtown Disney isn't Minnie Mouse's
over here we're just leaving the Parsee
it was hilarious like I feel like I just
experienced my first proper LA party it
didn't have red cups there did you ever
sign even it was really fun it was only
boys tomorrow night now I have a panel
though I have to be there at 9:00 I can
wake up my god everybody knows that's
like it's like a lot of fun when it's
nearly 1:00 so we got ahead more name
here's my bed here's Anna's bed just
thought we should all right we've got
I've got a panel this morning knowing
you I'm saying but let's go and see what
this is all about if I drop the barbeque
see we draw the program I throw a
chicken sandwich out the window was
happening I've just finished my panel
and it was actually much better than I
thought it was really interesting
because I was like a book girl techie
guy a food guy and the enemy is like
these seats are interesting you go
inside and Dame drops I know a lie I
didn't know him before the panel my son
is to him and I loved him he was so nice
and hilariously cheeky the hockey I got
to hug him and get a photo and he took
one of me on you it was very exciting
so now I'm gonna have like a little
browse around VidCon and go look at the
lounges in the little speaker with a
little big room the big room downstairs
see what's going on but Harold done just
hanging out in the histogram loud you've
kind of been here for ages now they've
got food and drinks but Hannah's got her
camel in a minute
you looking for Todd are you thinking of
something interesting to say the other
night she says I'll definitely link her
channel down below because you should
check garage she's really really nice
girl and after the panel we change
issuing the rumors and doing like seeing
everyone from having a major afternoon
to Tulagi session and banner just
finished up a knowledge did really well
as we must watch huge mentioned me like
four times
bagging alone I don't like walking away
from the audience
we're gonna
gosh I fell down vlogging again I had to
get back to the hotel to schedule a
video for tomorrow and now we're coming
up for dinner at place loop the ranch
which looks quite nice for Anaheim we
struggle to find anywhere nice but this
actually looks really good dinner's
finished lots of cry laughing and we're
gonna head to the maker party but I
don't know how much blogging I'm going
to do I can't just want to enjoy like
seeing people and I'll try and make
wait okay but can we show them all away
yes so I'm wearing this Topshop dress
and my sandals because I thought it'd
better be comfy banana looks nice what's
the view a subscriber 21 month with ASUS
t-shirt where Oscar the supply Hillsboro
Attica with my future
we have returned to our room and the
makeup party was fun I mean I think for
like it was a little bit hyped up but
that always happens last night we had a
really good time and it was fun tonight
it was nice to see we met um Arden and
Will and they were really nice and
obviously we saw Alanna again she's
lovely oh gosh is laid on the bed now I
feel bad that I didn't film more and
like I feel like I haven't really
documented the real VidCon and what it's
like from my perspective but it's so
hard and I kind of wanted to just take
in and enjoy it and not have my camera
out the whole time so I'm sorry for that
but I hope that you guys enjoyed this
vlog anyway and got a little peek inside
VidCon and I think I'm gonna end it here
because tomorrow we're just flying home
and like you're probably take some
snazzy like window shots of us landing
but first it's an 11 hour flight
overnight I'm going to be exhausted and
I just feel like you've seen a plane
landing before you don't need to see
that again so I'm gonna end the vlog
here and I hope you've enjoyed my two la
vlogs if you haven't seen part one I
will link it below this video go check
that out and can you show on your leg we
had to like jump over a fence to get out
and it's like I want to scratch my leg
no that is not a scratch that's a
freaking like girl oh my gosh okay I'm
going this is but stop stretching it so
just okay
