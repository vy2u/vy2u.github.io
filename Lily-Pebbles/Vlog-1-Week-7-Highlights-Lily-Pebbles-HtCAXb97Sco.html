gonna be a little bit different I
haven't got that much going on this
weekend coming so instead of logging
over the weekend I'm gonna do the whole
week and I'm gonna highlight one thing
per day to vlog so I really hope you
enjoy this different format and let me
know what you think so for today my one
highlight is that I'm doing a little
talk at advertising week Europe which is
a whole kind of week-long convention
where marketing advertising people pay
to go and watch talks and I'm doing a
talk with a few other people on YouTube
so I'm super nervous I basically just
have to stand up and talk about what I
do quite nervous about having to stand
on a podium and do a proper speech but I
think being scared of doing something is
really important and if you're ever
nervous to do something that means you
have to do it because it means it's
going to be a good learning experience
and doing more talks like this I think
is really good practice for me just kind
of build up confidence and they always
come in handy knowing how to like do
public speaking so pretty nervous but
I'm gonna head into town it's at BAFTA
which is a really cool venue and I've
got a kind of little speech planned and
it's a little bit scary but I'm looking
forward to giving it a go hey so I'm
back at home no longer on a scary stage
with a microphone and hundreds of people
watching we was actually really good I
was really nervous before but once I got
on stage I was fine and the other people
speaking was Alfie deyes Bertie Gilbert
and Jack Howard and it was really
interesting I think it was a good mix of
people we all do very different kind of
videos so it was really cool to hear
them talk as well and it was cool just
talking about what I do and think people
find it interesting it'll work very
quickly and my god knows what I even
said but it's a good experience so that
was my one highlight from today and I'll
see you guys tomorrow
hey guys it's Tuesday day two and today
is being a stay at home working kind of
day my makeup did look nice I promise
but I had a mental breakdown and decided
to burst into tears around three o'clock
this afternoon I think will you girls
will understand how that feels when you
have no idea it's coming but then
suddenly you're crying about some paper
straws to cheer me up I'm going for
dinner with Anna and Amelia which is
really so nice so I just facing hey
while I've waited for everyone and I
picked up an Archie glow in a shade that
actually suits me because I have to in
the rotary dog and Anna's last blog
where she was wearing it made me want it
again so look who I've just found me
Leah and I are already deep so we picked
up a little magazine and ridiculous
price of food per day now we anticipated
time
the girls getting ice cream
we're back in the same place I've been
here before before and I'm not going to
get up if you know if I'm not getting
ice cream good what did you get I got I
think it's black cherry black cherry
go and try it live good we're currently
watching so of Anna's old videos it was
just so entertaining I have no eyebrows
now watching everything
Amelia's off goodbye so after sitting in
the ice-cream shop for an hour or an
hour and a half catching up from now
going to go to media and is here and I
think this is it for day two so I'll see
you tomorrow
hey it's Wednesday day three and
remember when I showed you that I was
having ice-skating lessons well it's 12
weeks later and I'm still having them me
and my sister have just really been
enjoying them for me it's like half an
hour out of the week where I lock my
phone away in a locker and it's
absolutely heaven and it's test week
again so today we're gonna see whether
we're gonna move from level 4 to level 5
we're still not taking it very seriously
but I'm pretty good at it so hopefully
we pass if not we're still gonna carry
on so I'm going to take you guys with me
ice skating if I can film a bit in there
so I'm in Alexandra Palace which is
where I do my ice-skating lesson I'm
whispering because it's very quiet I'm
just waiting for my sister to turn up
right I have my lucky skates on number
52 they're the ones I always wear I
don't know why they just fit me and so I
get them every time
this is where we ice skate I didn't show
you last time this is our test card so
what have we done so far we've basically
we're trying to do level 4 so then we'll
be on level 5 so I don't think I'm gonna
be able to feel much when I'm actually
doing my test but hopefully rich is
gonna come at the end and watch and I
might give him the camera to film me or
my sister if you can look who's here
how was your run bit smokey
which means at the end to their five
match starts again in a few weeks and
it's quite something tonight

halfway passed and I'm going home now to
you some dinner and that's it for day

working all day and filling videos it's
the afternoon now and I'm going off for
a couple of meetings and then I'm going
to a sauce headquarters to go to there I
think it's a spring summer press day I
didn't get to go to a lot of events
