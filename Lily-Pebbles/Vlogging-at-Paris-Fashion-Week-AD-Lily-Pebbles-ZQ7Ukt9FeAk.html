week but I'm in Paris we travelled up
this afternoon we got the Eurostar I
just love how easy it is you can just
jump on a train and then you're in Paris
it's completely genius I'm really happy
to be here I love Paris I think it's so
beautiful and so exciting unfortunately
the weather is terrible it's been
pouring with rain all afternoon we've be
sure has been like walking around the
shops and getting to know the area that
we're staying in this weekend is going
to be very busy I'm here with well a
professional you guys know this video is
in collaboration with Weller and so was
my last vlog on Thursday it's Paris
Fashion Week and I've never been to
Paris Fashion Week before I've been to
London Fashion Week I've been to New
York I've never done Paris so I'm really
looking forward to seeing that I'm going
to three shows two tomorrow one Sunday
I'm getting my hair done it's gonna be
really exciting but tonight it's like
the calm before the storm and we are
going out for dinner I suggested cafe
Mali because I always seem to go there
when I come to Paris my parents took me
quite a few years ago and I always go
back because it's just such a nice vibe
in there the food is great oh wait let
me show you what I'm wearing now this is
my Topshop spotty top my YSL bag my
Topshop jeans my June boots
and I'm gonna put on my top shot bomber
as well I don't love this top by itself
but once it's got a bomber on top it
looks quite cool like just peeking
through ooh
CAD light who looks like a snapchat
filter okay so this is George everybody
oh my she also works at Glee mother
going to dinner I just wanted to
introduce it to dojo is there in the dog
training and I forgot my umbrella
yet coming Mali now darling good morning
everyone
excuse my makeup free face and pyjamas
but I've just pretty much just woken up
and today is day one of Paris Fashion
Week I'm gonna be doing my makeup in a
minute but I just thought I'd show you
my outfit option for day one these are
my top shop culottes these are the shoes
that I bought in APSA damn I'll try and
find the brand name and link it below if
I can this top is from Topshop so either
way this will be like loose over the top
this sweater from auvergne outfits is
tucked in or this kind of high neck Zara
top that I got yesterday and tucked in
or not tucked in I'm gonna try them all
on and see but this is the option for
day one I'm gonna have very cold ankles
it's meant to be snowing today I'm not
gonna do my hair because I'm going to
get my hair done in a salon this morning
but let me do my makeup shower all of
that fun stuff and then I will come back
to you and kind of explain what is going
on today I'm nearly done with my makeup
I think I'm gonna leave my lipstick till
the end to see what goes with my outfit
probably put on a red lip and my hair
still looks horrendous but I thought I'd
show you my breakfast because it's just
arrived and I'm really excited about it
it's like a proper pitied is Rene I've
got fresh orange juice they just do the
best fresh orange juice in France loads
of pastries I actually just asked for a
pair shockula it doesn't oh there's a
mini Paschal Florina some soft boiled
eggs and jams and stuff and this looks
amazing so I didn't really explain why
I'm in Paris Fashion Week I kind of did
but I kind of didn't well er a
sponsoring three of the shows and
they're gonna be using their products I
me backstage so I'm here to like report
on that and film some of it and see the
hair looks they're global creative
director Eugene Salomon is going to be
doing the hair looks backstage but I'm
going to two shows today acne and
Vivienne Westwood I'm gonna go backstage
have a look at the hair and the makeup
and then I'm gonna go and watch the
shows as well but first of all I'm
heading to a salon so they can fix this
hair on my head I'm think I might go for
some kind of plat updo today I'm not
sure but I feel like this outfit could
probably take hair up like my hairs off
at the moment I think
alright it just you know doesn't okay my
head plus it the size and then never
loop it over the back pocket Georgia to
show you go to the back quite different
but I was like I'm gonna try something
up they're different
it'll go with my outfit so they use all
I new products today I will link below
the products that you use it's one that
you recommended I use on damp hair
because they whenever I go to head rest
of them at your hair so dry but yeah I
really like the finish look so we're
gonna go announce to the acne show and
I'm gonna go backstage and see what
they're doing with the hair
okay Georgia fainted that was very
dramatic
she fainted backstage so I sent her back
to the hotel I'm really worried about
her and I'm on my own but it's fine
I'm gonna go to the AXI show now so I
just went to the Acne show or I need to
reapply my lipstick it was really cool
crazy as always Fashion Week I'm a
little bit cold so I'm just kind of
getting warm in the car again and then
I'm gonna go to the Vivienne Westwood
show I'm gonna pop him backstage see
what the hair is like the Hef the last
one was like slicked down and then out
it's meant to look like when you take a
beanie off like hat hair so now I'm
gonna go to video
we've just been hanging out backstage at
Vivienne Westwood and chatting to Eugene
who is so nice and he told me he thought
I was really stylish which is much
compliment I went all red and
embarrassed he said he liked my shoes so
I'm glad I got the shoes mastered and
I'm now gonna go and watch the show but
if you go to it the hell it I think I'm
just gonna like change my clothes chill
catch up on social media and then I
think me and George are gonna take it
easy tonight cuz poor George ah he's
feeling much better now luckily but
we're gonna take easy and just eat
somewhere local and early tonight I am
not really up for like getting all
dressed up and going out we've got more
shows tomorrow and quite a busy day I
think I'm gonna leave my hair like this
until tonight and then take out because
tomorrow I think I'm just wearing it
kind of like normal so I need to somehow
brush out all the hairspray hopefully
without having to re wash it changed out
of fashion II clothes and into a comfy
jeans jumper big cozy furry coat
situation and it's only like 6 o'clock
but we're gonna go for a burger
this is are we gonna go to dinner
someone on Instagram recommended it
we just want something really easy
I keep doing that thing where I forget
to end the vlog but I will be back
tomorrow for day two Paris Fashion Week
so see you guys in the morning
we've just had a really nice breakfast
they have these little yogurts that I
used to eat all the time when I secure
France as a kid so that made me really
happy I'm just gonna pack up my stuff
now and then the hairdresser's coming to
my room at 12 which is very fancy he's
going to do my hair today and I think
I'm just gonna ask for like soft waves
like I usually wear it because the whole
idea of the I need brand is to kind of
express your individuality anyway and
that's kind of my signature look if I
were to have one so I'm gonna ask for
like some soft waves slightly textured
and you guys know how I normally wear my
hair and then I've got to figure out
what I'm wearing today I've just been
reading through all the lovely comments
and tweets from you guys on my Mother's
Day video so thank you very much
this is what my hair looks like kind of
my usual style but better because I'm
really bad at doing the back thanks for
helping with my hair I'm just gonna head
backstage at the roller Marais show to
see kind of what's going on I think
they've just started and this is quite a
big one for Eugene so I'm looking
forward to seeing what the hair look is
gonna be and I'm gonna go catch up with
him now
okay so just watch Eugene do the hair
and it's basically like very undone he
washed all the girls hairs before they
came and then the partying is like
really pulled forward and middle passing
and then like the hairs really like it's
a kind of busy elegant I think it's
gonna look really nice when they will be
down the catwalk erm he literally just
use hair spray in the hair and then like
really flattened the top of the hair as
well I've just been taking some like
street style photos outside if you guys
didn't see the finished photos on my
Instagram which is that Lenny pebbles so
go and have a look at that and I'm gonna
head to the front to actually go to the
show
I'm just gonna quickly talk through my
outfit for today I'm wearing my top shot
performer which are a friend of love
although I'm upset that I'm old hardware
my strategy or just hotland
I miss you shoes from Zara it says the
jeans and t find a girl and then the
skirt I found in a shop in Amsterdam
I think the shops good news I love that
shop and then the beach
so skirts been different for me but I
think it kind of works okay I'm back
from the show now I just ran back to the
hotel to quickly change into more
comfortable clothes because we are going
straight to the train station to get the
Euro style home we're just in the
Eurostar lounge and this is my favorite
place because they do these like mini
saucy song balls they look like this and
they're so delicious I'm having a great
time and they've got bad lines here I'm
gonna use this train journey to edit
this vlog because it's going to be
pretty epic and pretty long so I'll see
you guys on the other end on the other
side where you puts the same not the
other end I'm home and lovely rich has
made me dinner veggie chili with
cauliflower rice yeah I think I'm gonna
wrap up the vlog here because now I'm
home and I've got to unpack and I'm
feeling quite tired but I've had such a
good weekend at Paris Fashion Week thank
you so much the world professionals for
taking me it was just so exciting and I
loved every minute and I think it's been
a really good like collaboration I hope
you guys enjoyed it RI me the products

like and what this channel hopefully
represents so I think it works really
