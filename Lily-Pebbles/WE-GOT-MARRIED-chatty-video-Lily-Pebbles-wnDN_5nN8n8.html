done a video for a couple of weeks or
for a week or so and that's because me
and rich got married last weekend when
this video goes up it'll be Saturday
24th of September we got married quick
disclaimer we're both so tired very why
we might not seen that dizziest ik which
has a really bad cough so he might cough
throughout this whole video yeah Marie
currently in Soho farmhouse just like
recuperating because we are exhausted
but it was the best day ever the best
been biased we are so biased it was the
best wedding ever but we thought we'd
quickly just talk through like where
we've been what happened and then as I
told you guys I am going to be uploading
a video but all the videos and photos
takes so long to come when I'm desperate
to share everything with you guys I put
a couple of photos on Instagram but
until the rest come this is as much as
we can do we got married on the 24th of
September in Suffolk which is where
riches from stomping ground
yeah so rich war would you'd you were so
I got my suit from a place called Oscar
Milo in Spitalfields yeah I'm with cool
little designer shops got a full suit
from there got my shirts from Ted Baker
and a mai tai from a source yeah right
bargain yeah I'll wear my shoes I love
my shoes best shoes I've ever bought
they were from Justin Rees yeah maybe
we've liked blue lady laces and then
blue wingtips and very nice love them my
dress was from a brand called Katherine
Dean it was actually separate so it was
a skirt and like a bodice but I actually
gotten to sew it together because I was
worried it would kind of separate and
you'd see my stomach so it sewn together
and then I had a lace top as well so it
was three parts three separates um it
was much more affordable than I wanted
to spend I was so happy with it but I
didn't when I tried on I didn't really
try dancing and the third time I tried
it on I suddenly realized that my arms
are really restricted and I just didn't
want to be one of those Brides that was
like all night so I actually got another
top from needle and thread and I trained
I changed into that after the kind of
champagne reception for dinner and
dancing and I could just let my arms
free and dance and do
I let loose it was like a little sparkly
beaded number my shoes were from Steve
Madden I bought them in New York and I
changed into my converse in the evening
so Harrisons came and did my hair Shawn
from her seasons what a dude absolutely
love him he did my hair my mom and my
sisters incredible he did it up in like
this platter do I will share photos when
I have and put in some like Ivy and
little flowers I really really liked it
Sam Chapman from pixie woo did my makeup
which was so incredible such an honor it
was so nice to have her there in the
morning she was so calming and so lovely
she also did my mom's makeup Bobbie
Brown said Ashley and Amy who are both
pro artists to come and do my sisters my
sister-in-law and mother-in-law and a
few of my friends and they were
incredible such nice girls amazing
makeup artists so yeah thanks to Bobby
Brown because they absolutely loved that
I guess that's when the wedding started
so we got married in a venue that had
basically a big barn and a small barn so
the ceremony and the champagne reception
was it we're in a small barn and then
you moved into the big barn rich walked
in first with his parents all our
friends are there we had just over 100
guests so it was quite small I thought
and the whole place is just decorated
and like beautiful like ivy and
eucalyptus we walk down the aisle to
Beach Boys song one of my favs the kids
actually made it down the aisle yeah I
can't believe they like did rose petals
they were chucking the petals not on the
aisle but actually at the people salute
you without throwing it into the chair
the fact they walked down without having
a fit was just some kind of miracle and
then I walked in with my dad we got we
were gonna walk in with both parents but
that I was too narrow and I walked in
with my dad my best friend Jake actually
did the ceremony for us which was
incredible we wanted it to be really
personal and it was so incredible it was
so nice to have someone I've known my
whole life to the ceremony which
assisted at a reading my best friend SJ
and Andy from mamas Connie you probably
know did a song they sung at last by
Etta James it was so good so good and as
part of the ceremony as well and Jake
gathered some marriage advice from some
of our closest friends and family and
worked that into the ceremony and it was
so good that it was like a surprise for
us it was really funny and it was so
perfect makes seem funny and like
emotional as well Bailey was like the
ring bearer he bought the Rings for
and then at the end of the ceremony we
basically wanted to have a bit of a
singsong a bit of a sing-along and my
dad and our neighbor and Andy started
playing the guitar and we got everyone
to sing Hey Jude so good it was so
random but it worked it was so fun and
you know the end of the age when it's
like no no no no everyone was just
singing and coming up to hug us and we
walked out confetti and it was that bit
was like so good doesn't it house and it
was such a blur yeah that was probably
everyone says really just try and take
it in and just take every second in but
that literally went up from walking down
the aisle to then it took me about I was
like two minutes yeah the rest of it I
feel like I really remember that the
ceremony felt really fast to me because
it all just happened all of a sudden
everyone had like order of the day as
well I had a girl called Olivia
Whitworth who was incredible she did all
my stationery for me she was the girl
that rich found when he proposed with
the picture I'm going to be doing a blog
post because the invitations are saved
the dates the order of the day the menus
literally a dream and so I would
definitely share those designs with you
guys she was great
so the ceremony ended me and rich went
off to do like 20 minutes of photos we
had a lady called Razia as our
photographer and we had a company called
real vision do our videos those two
things are obviously incredibly
important for me I know some people just
get like friends and family to do it but
you guys know that was like one of the
main things I really wanted to invest in
so we went off to do 20 minutes of
photos together we didn't want to do
like loads of Posey photos with family
and friends because I think the natural
photos are the best and we really didn't
want to miss out on that kind of part of
the wedding so we had 20 minutes we
walked around oh we were so excited when
we went out we were like talking lift up
it was likely just one more minute shit
up 20 minutes no she was very patient we
were just good stuck talking yeah I feel
like grooms get sick after the wedding
boys get sick before my voice is a bit
funny because when I always lose my
voice and I'm singing so we did voters
and came back into the same bond where
everyone must aid after ceremony and
they had amazing canapes you had a
company called catering for Suffolk do
our food and it was so good on my way it
was all like utter lingu style like
middle-eastern delicious really
different food and we had like a pimp
your Prosecco stand like my sister may
decide and he had light cheese and
different
you raise and cordials that you can put
into your your Prosecco we also had the
table plan table there that was a mix of
like plants basically the whole wedding
there were loads of props from West Elm
and it was incredible looked amazing so
on that table plan there was like West
Elm planters with plants and I made all
these little flags with people's names
on and each table was named after a year
most of them are named after years of
family weddings so like the year our
grandparents got married or parents or
siblings so we also had loads of framed
photos of all those different weddings
as well that looks really cool that was
cool yeah we also during the champagne
reception had a live Cuban duo playing
we love like Cuban music I just thought
it'd be really nice we're not really the
string quartet kind of couple so we had
those and they play throughout and that
was really cool as well
so after the champagne reception it was
time for the guests to make their way
into the main barn no I think people at
that point were like wow the ceremony
was so cool and different but they had
no idea what was coming and when we
walked into the main barn like we pretty
much like designed the whole thing I
knew exactly what I wanted everything
was picked and designed by us but we had
a lady who created it on the day so we
didn't really know exactly what it would
look like I don't feel when you first
saw it like again not being vice but
when I walked in my mouth dropped I
don't normally get like that kind of
feeling I was like holy fuck
you can't say fuckin Y as I had done it
now I've done it
that's how I felt I was like whoa and
there's so much detail and because we
had Steph do it put it bring all
together chefs from a company called
revival rooms they are wedding planners
but we just used her foot on the day
coordination because I didn't want to
give all our friends like a million jobs
to do so she was there on the day to
decorate and make sure everything kind
of went on does a little flourish during
all of that but that barn was huge
really long and really high ceilings and
the actual bond itself is the oldest in
the UK and we looked at a lot of boxes I
think it's you hey okay okay I'm sure
Webber whatever career we looked at
loads of barns and some were really old
and rustic and a little bit too like
grimy and then some was so modern and
done up that they've lost all their
character and this was perfect it was
like felt like it'd been renovated and
it was nice
but it looks so incredible and like old
and like real as well so the whole barn
was decorated with festoon lighting
which is like those big bulbs that hang
fairy lights I basically wanted it to
like a forest that was like eucalyptus
and Ivy hanging everywhere pets potlucks
the lights yeah this the team who did
the lighting and it's good point
lighting don't worry when I do the
actual video I'm going to link all the
suppliers below see cuz they are I
recommend every single one of them yeah
they were brilliant more than but they
were just amazing just yeah they got it
then you're like the lighting guy he
came around and he goes right I'm gonna
pull these little spotlights around I
was like what spotlights enjoy trust me
watch this they pull the spotlights up
and he just lit up like with the flowers
and all the detail that we had put
together put together with Steph yeah it
just he just brought up all tonight hey
dance Phil yeah over the dancer was like
all these hanging festoon lights and
like loads of fairy lights behind where
the band we're going to be we also had
like a sofa area with like a West Elm
sofa and loads of deck or like the
detail and at the back of the bomb was
like a dessert table with lights that
said eat and we had all the dessert
there and we had like Livia's crumbles
Krispy Kreme Doughnuts I'm so good we
also had a photo booth later in the
evening from Romany called sweets and
treats which worked out so well so fun a
really good one so we went into the barn
and everyone kind of found their seats
and we had a few speeches but they were
in between courses rather than all
together at the end you did a speech yes
oh my gosh so the first speech was my
dad which was hilarious oh my god there
was one point in the speech where he
referred to me my mom my sister's as his
bitches and I don't have ever seen
anyone laugh so much in my life or so
funny
I did a speech to introduce richer
speech but it was it was like a proper
speech it's good really surprised it's
like a puppet yeah yeah I thought it was
gonna be like three or four minutes
because you said you're just going to
introduce me but it's not good it's long
no it was I made a minute yeah that's
what me not normal there's a good speech
and then written is yours are so so
impressed with your speech everyone was
laughing I thought you know speech is
good when people at the wedding who
don't know you that well you know
there's always a few people who aren't
completely like in the inner circle and
they were like really laughing yeah
and then nivo which is best friend our
best friend do
a best man's speech as well so the salsa
was like delicious like fig and
mozzarella
rocket salad and Parma ham and the
boards
yeah like homemade made fresh flat
breads and then like loads of hummus and
it made homemade dipping oils like basil
and chili oils and the main was also
like sharing so there was one person for
each table that was designated as the
Carver nay got owned hmm home apron like
a really nice gray apron and I made like
a little sheet of paper that told them
that there was a carver and so we had
this amazing like marinated
middle-eastern lamb and then loads of
bowls like these amazing West Elm bowls
filled with lots of different salads
there's like cauliflower sweet potato
green beans yeah what was the other like
quinoa yeah so everyone was just sharing
and getting stuck in it was quite good
for socializing as well a real feast
exactly and it was delicious oh my god I
wish on eating more everyone says that
you don't eat your wedding I really
tried it wasn't that I didn't have time
to eat it was like I just there's other
things I wanted to do I'm so excited
yeah I loved every minute of it
seriously after dinner
our friends actually surprised us my
sisters and not and our friends
surprised us with a video so they put
this huge projector and my sister Carly
had kind of organized this but everyone
had got involved and it was basically
this huge piss-take video out of me and
what I do and vlogging it was so funny
Anna like Deb's Hannah
sjakie all my friends were involved my
dad was in there they were basically
just like pretending to vlog I really
want to put out on my youtube channel
but I haven't quite decided if it's like
- I don't know I'm gonna think about it
but it was so funny bummer
at one point it was like hashtag ad in
the corner was just so good for autistic
it was so good yet and then and then we
did our first dance yeah we had a band
but it was kind of a band that been put
together by friends and a wedding band
it was Andy and his wife Jodi and then
they kind of got a few friends together
a couple of people from mom has gone a
couple of session musicians they were
incredible they played for an hour we
did our first dance - and the Eagles
love will keep us alive I can't believe
we actually did a first dance but when
we did a twelve we didn't use it at 12 I
did as well we were so nervous we can't
slow does everyone joined in it was fine
yeah and then it was just like crazy
dancing for an hour and then we had a
deal
J Zoe London DJs she's brilliant
everyone loved the playlist it was
basically a throwback playlist DJ set so
like lots of early 2000 you know Blu
Cantrell breathe that kind of stuff I
feel like I don't even know what we've
missed out but that was kind of it and
then it went on all night and we danced
at the end I really wanted the last song
to be take that never forget and I'm so
glad we did it because mark Ana's mark
and our friends Mike Paul and Ryan my
brother-in-law got up on stage as like a
take that tribute band and I'm
pretending my gig is like a gig the
videographer had gone home by that point
but the photographer was there it was
literally like they were doing a gig it
was so funny that was probably
definitely one my favorite bit yeah and
I hope you have a good I think we had
like a beer station the day station we
got our local brewery to do keg bring a
keg and loads of bottle beers and it's
all set out nicely it looked amazing we
also and had our in slow Gin free for a
year since last October we no one knew
know we've been collecting vintage shot
glasses from all these different charity
shops around the UK everyone's been
helping us so everyone had this vintage
shot glass and then last October we
actually picked slows from Hampstead
Heath in London and we had to like prick
every slow and we put it in gin and
sugar and made our own slow Jim heads
like shake it every six weeks and that's
been living in our flat for a year so
everyone had a shot of sloe gin at the
end of the best band speech and it was
delicious
yeah we made our own cocktails one was
called pebbles punch and one was called
the dancing Dudley righteous midrange
Dudley so funny I had my leather jacket
with me which I put on at the end of the
night to go home yeah so I feel like
that's kind of it I mean you just know
where you can even visualize how
incredible it looked until you see
photos and videos and I can't wait to
share all the photos and stuff with you
so sorry if I'm going to drive you mad
but it's been a year in the planning and
I've kept so secretive about everything
that now I just want to tell everyone
everything so I will be spamming you

really did it together and I'm so proud
that nothing went wrong wrong it was
perfect it was like the odd few
logistical things that I might have
changed looking back but nothing major
