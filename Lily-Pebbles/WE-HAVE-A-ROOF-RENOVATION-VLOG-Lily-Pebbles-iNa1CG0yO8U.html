to another renovation vlog update just
to give you a bit of context in terms of
time I just got back from my holiday in
Gran Canaria last night so we're really
excited to see the house because we
haven't seen it for a week
I think the extension is almost finished
I think they're going to do the roof
over the next few days and that will be
finished and we need to pop over now to
talk through the upstairs bathroom and
all the electrics for downstairs like
where we want plug sockets and stuff to
go which is something I find really
tricky because I don't even know I kind
of want them everywhere but then the new
kind of law if you're redoing your
electrics state that they have to be
quite high up in the wall so they're
really like obvious so I also don't
really want them to be everywhere but
you kind of need lots of plug sockets
Spence have more than unless I think so
we're getting ahead of the house now to
do that and I'm really excited they'll
probably be builders there I don't we
don't want a vlog in front of them so
I'll probably just take some clips and
then talk through them afterwards so he
went to the house and it was really cool
to see how it's developed in a week
they've pretty much built the extension
now both walls and the back wall which
means that we could get the door company
round to measure up the doors we're
going for aluminium black Krita Lisle
doors not steel mainly because they're
cheaper and they are warmer we're going
with a company called aspire so pay the
deposit and got a quote and stuff but we
couldn't kind of get them made until
that space was built so that was our
main priority and they've come round and
measured for that space it's really cool
now that that back wall has been knocked
down to see how big the area is where
our kitchens gonna go I'm I I'm not
shocked by it like I really had the
vision and it turned out just as I kind
of had hoped but it's really cool to see
other people's reactions when they come
over because they're like oh my god
there's so much more space and so happy
just like a small like three meters
isn't that much that's how much we've
extended out the back but it makes such
a difference in terms of like internal
space so yeah that was really exciting
all the floors been like ripped up so as
you can see in our lounge there's like
no floor there it's just like the joists
I think it's good we're gonna have
underfloor heating put in there
tomorrow's gonna be a really exciting
day because we've got a lot of surveys
happening we've got the kitchen company
people coming around so we're using
herringbone kitchens they're coming to a
survey we've got ripples bathrooms
coming around to talk to the builders
and show them what to do and how the
bottoms are going to be done because
we've been planning those for the
last few months and we've also got a
flooring company who are called parquet
flooring coming to measure up the space
so all these things that we've been
planning and talking to the ages are
actually starting to happen now so it's
all very exciting or not update to you
again tomorrow okay we're on our way to
the house and the first people meeting
are ripples bathrooms lovely bottom
designer Annabelle who I have just loved
working with her she is so common went
to a few different bathroom places had
some really terrible experiences and
then we man about and she was just great
like I feel like I want to be her friend
she really got my vision and she's
lovely to work with so she's now coming
over to kind of refile builders and
explain to them the layout the bottom
and how it should all be fit which is
really nice because it makes me feel
like a keys that they are gonna install
everything like we had discussed it
would look so that's the first thing is
happening and then Adrian from
herringbone kitchens and it's going
around to do survey of the space
obviously be extended so he needs to
come look at the space and just check
all the measurements right and we're
going to like maybe change a few things
in terms of like where the island is
going to go we want three hanging lights
above the island but because we've got
skylights kind of complicated me to move
that around as well and then at some
point today as well someone from Park a
fluorine are coming I'm so excited I
think that's going to make such a
massive difference to the house I can't
wait to have parking fluorine so it's
real wood sorry we're going on during
tunnel and we chose a colorful truffle
gray so it's like kind of cool
I didn't want anything to oranjee I
didn't want anything to like to keep
this somewhere in the middle and I think
it's gonna look great we also now
decided to have that in the hallway as
well as it's just throughout the
downstairs of the house we just came
from the house and I might pop in back
later to show you because I can't really
film when the builders are there but
they've already started and plastering
upstairs which is really exciting to see
the walls looking normal again and they
put like new joists down and down stairs
which look really good and really neat
and yeah we had went through a talked
through both bathrooms to talk through
the kitchen and there was like so much
information I didn't know what they were
talking about half the time but it's all
feeling really organized and on track if
not maybe a bit faster than scheduled
which is great okay you just popped to
the house I thought I'd quickly show you
an update of what's going on they've
started to build the roof of the
extensions so as you can see this is
where the skylight is gonna go which is
pretty cool to see it like that actually
so that's I think the main thing that's
been happening today I'll show you
upstairs as well you just come to the
house and they've plastered the room is
the bedroom it's so soft and smooth and
silky very excited about this makes it
look a bit proper again this is the this
is our living room floor right now it's
so crazy to see like it's held up by all
these bricks and it's so much lower down
and there's like you're loads of weird
stuff as well like under the floor you
don't even know about we've just come to
check the house and I wanted to show you
guys but there's literally like no
boards out for us to walk on this is the
the current floor situation rich just
balanced his way over there so I feel
like there's not much to show I'd might
take you upstairs the roof done yeah I
know I want to come see how did you do
that I feel like this is not good I've
got bad neck describe it to us the rest
of the house is still looking pretty
chaotic and we don't bring you upstairs
slightly concerned about this ladder
which is just like balancing here so
let's hope this doesn't fall on me
they've just redone this wall
yesterday this wall was exposed so
they've kind of put something there I'm
not really sure what that's about and
they've done the same here again don't
really know all that it's about but cool
and then my office has been plastered
yay is it wet little bit I mean some of
the rooms have been plastered now which
is amazing looking out of my office
window you can see the skylight and the
roof which is really cool okay it's a
Thursday I've had working from home day
so annoying any makeup but I'm gonna
head over to the house I actually went
there this morning to meet the
electricians but um I'm going back
because I want to measure up
dining-table space and see what size we
can get I would love an 8 seater but I
think we're gonna be able to fit six
seater
which is good because I reckon you
normally have like six people over but
it would be nice to have the option to
have more there are extendable tables
but I think because of where's our where
ours is going it won't be able to I'm
out of breath from walking up the stairs
this is a joke I think because of the
wall we won't be able to extend anyway
I'm gonna go measure that space and take
my parents around because they haven't
seen the house in a while also rich
gonna meet us there after work just got
to the house and they've plastered all
of the hallway that is so exciting
sorry I've used the word exciting a lot
in this video but I love a plastered
wall the little things pleased me now I
started doing the wall to the toilet
actually maybe that's just for privacy
I think that's privacy because they
using that temporary toilet there so
what's happened today I'll take you
upstairs because you can see the roof
from my office if you look out the
window we've started doing something to
the fireplace over there not sure of the
technical term so all of this has been
plastered including the ceiling which is
really really cool oh wow so they put
all these wooden boards down in the
bathroom and they've put the bars here I
guess it's just it says keep get out of
the way but it's weird to see it
actually in position so I'm kind of
leaning out the bathroom window here but
you can see rich what's this black stuff
that they put on the roof I think it's
like tar this is what makes it kind of
waterproof and
stuff you need to put on a roof
basically don't really know but that's
yes the other day when I showed you it's
just wood I think so that's now gone on
top of the wood there's loads of
deliveries here these are the tiles we
are having in our downstairs toilets
they're obviously dirty they're not
gonna like that but they're just like
slate hexagon tiles they did it really
cool I like those it's hard to keep
track of what's actually changed it's
the last time I came here but I've just
noticed that they've put the shower tray
down so this goes underneath the tiles
and it basically slopes slightly so that
you can have it like a walk-in kind of
wet room type thing and it just looks
like it's tiled I'm just at the house
you have to excuse what I look like
because it was Keisha's hen party last
night and I'm very tired and hungover
and there's not much to update you on I
don't think it's getting to that point
again where they're doing little things
I can't really notice and also until our
back doors come every time I come here
when the builders aren't here the back
is boarded up and it's like drilled in
so it's much darker when I'm here
vlogging and I can't go out the back so
it's quite tricky to film at the moment
but I'll show you around so the whole
hallway here is all been plastered I
think I might showing you that already
so let me take you downstairs
they started putting whoa sorry I nearly
fell over they started putting this down
on the floor and then I think the
underfloor heating is going to go on top
of that and then our wooden flooring
goes on top of that they've also started
doing the electrics down here for this
room I can't kind of go over there but
you can see they've chased for the plug
sockets and they've continued that all
the way downstairs and here they've also
done the plug sockets for the kitchen
we're just going to go along here and
then the roof I think is the same as it
was last time I came over they've also
been helped digging out our bamboo in
the back garden so not much of an update
today but electrics the stuff have gone
in also one over there they my
electricians really good and he
suggested that if we're sitting outside
in the garden at night and we come back
in and want to turn the light on he's
put a switch just there by the back door
which is really cool good morning
everyone I am gonna head to the house
later I'm gonna try go there while the
builders are there so that I can
actually film some stuff while the
boards on up I actually don't really
know what they're doing today but I will
see but I thought whilst I'm vlogging I
just put up my video of the first
renovation vlog yesterday
thank you so much for all of your kind
comments and for watching the video and
stuff I thought I would answer a few
questions I got as comments someone
asked if I could put the dates in from
when I'm vlogging but I kind of thought
a lot about how I'm gonna document this
beforehand and I feel like filming this
process as interesting as it is and I as
much don't want to do it it is a very
personal thing to do so I think my way
and even though if it makes sense but my
way of just keeping it a little bit
personal is by not putting the dates up
because then I'm not kind of telling the
whole world about what state my house is
at at this current time like the content
is slightly delayed so I won't be
putting dates up but when I'm done I
will talk through the whole renovation
and how long it took and yeah how long
the whole project took and our
expectations versus what happened all of
that so that's why there aren't dates
sorry that is a bit confusing but
hopefully you're still enjoying it
anyway just so many so many nice
comments let me see if there are any
other questions lots of people have said
we it looks like it's moving really fast
and yeah we've been really well I
wouldn't say lucky with our builders we
did a lot of research and we basically
got all of our potential builders from
recommendations from friends so we had
five recommendations like lots of
friends parents of stuff who have done
work to their houses and we basically
narrowed it down to three and then we
met up with all of them we talked
through the whole thing we got quotes
from them some came out a lot cheaper
but kind of only wanted cash and we
didn't really feel comfortable with that
and we basically just compared the three
different quotes but also we met up with
them and we got a feel you know one
person that we met up with made a really
like kind of rude comment about
something in the house and it just made
me feel uncomfortable so I was like even
though you know maybe he's more
affordable I didn't I didn't feel
comfortable with that you have to be
comfortable with these people so that's
how we picked ours and you know we're
really happy they've been doing an
amazing job so definitely kind of speak
to anyone else you know in your area who
is doing work sometimes if you walk
around like your local roads if
someone's having work done you can go in
and like ask for their card that's also
quite a good way of finding builders
quite a few comments of people just
being like no I can't believe you ripped
out the original fireplace
they weren't original fireplaces we're
keeping all the original features in the
house I love that about the house the
banisters the kind of skirting and the
corner scene and the doors but the
fireplaces were not original they were
installed a few years ago to go with
kind of really gothic theme of the house
so don't worry
they weren't original we really hated
them yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't have
ripped them out if they were beautiful
original fireplaces we're gonna put on
like a really simple mantelpiece that
looks like an original one someone asked
about saving the sash windows at the
back of the house and you're see because
of the sort of windows and doors were
having and we had to knock down that
kind of back door and window but they
were both actually really rotted and we
wouldn't be able to keep them anyway the
windows upstairs at the back of the
house are also completely destroyed so
we are having new windows at the back to
go with the back door but the front of
the house we're keeping all the original
sash windows which are terrible like the
windows and our bedroom is so paper-thin
they like rustle when you walk around
and it's freezing in our bedrooms so one
day we'll probably have to redo them but
they are so expensive so for now we're
just keeping them as they are yeah I
think that was about it a massive hats
off to anyone who's living in their
house while doing that kind of
renovation work we're just so lucky that
we can stay at my parents it's made such
a difference so a few people who
commented saying that they're living in
their house while doing that kind of
work like I don't know how you're doing
it so well done to you okay I just got
to the house and look all the bamboo
roots have been dug up this is
incredible they're all in the middle
here when we actually have like flat
soil so we can have like a shed back
here and some other staff very excited
about this who knew I'd be so excited
about bamboo roots but well look how
thick they are that's actually insane it
was actually not much else to show you
at the house they were just laying down
the kind of heating stuff was cooled
like the thermo stuff that goes under
the underfloor heating they were just
putting that all over the floor and the
plumber was upstairs kind of starting on
the bathroom and but just doing all like
plumbing stuff that you can't really see
but our wood floor sample has just
arrived our stairs I'll go show you they
kind of treated the wood and made up a
little sample for us but they're
currently making making it all for the
rest of the house so I'll show you the
sample it looks different in different
colors
in sunlight it looks a little like kind
of whitewashed I'm not in direct
sunlight
I prefer oh it looks like no indirect
sunlight but I like what looks like an
both it's really nice I just wanted
something cool toned I didn't want like
a warm wood I didn't want something
really really light to me it kind of
goes with the other colors in the house
like the navy blues that were having in
the whites and it feels like a little
bit like kind of mid-century to me I'm
going to show you example and you can
decide what you think this is what the
sample looks like obviously it's gonna
look really contrasting and different
with my parents floor which is quite a
warm wood so this one looks like I
really like the size of the the wood
because of the we're having parquet like
this and it looks quite grown camera
like I said it looks different in
different lights but I think it's really
nice and yeah I'm really happy with it
just gonna take an extra shot from back
here because when you're a bit further
away you can kind of see the tones
better I just came from the house and I
think this has been the first day that I
haven't been really excited about it and
just been a bit like oh I'm a control
freak a self-confessed control freak and
I am like that because I know that if
something is totally out of my control I
just get really stressed so I made loads
of big decisions early on about the
bathroom and kitchen and stuff so that I
wouldn't have to make like any quick
decisions but with a house renovation
like this is always going to be some
like quick decisions you have to make
and I went there today and they were
asking me about like thermostats and how
many thermostats could control the
underfloor heating to control the
upstairs radiators where I want the
lights and the front of the house and
like just things I really hadn't thought
about and I find it really difficult to
like form an opinion on stuff when I I
don't know
so that wasn't that funny and which had
knowledge me about thermostats and then
I fell through the ground like I asked
any walk on the beams I walked on like
the their kind of lining and I just my
leg went straight through the ground so
that was a bit shocking I'm fine but oh
I just I feel like I need a nap it's
like 10:30 in the morning and I'm like
mentally
shattered that's meant to be filming a
video today okay I think what I will do
before I end this video is show you guys
a kind of design of
bathrooms and wardrobes because that's
kind of where we're at bar teams are
started to get fitted and I went over
there yesterday with a friend of mine
who designs wardrobes but she doesn't
really do it as a living anymore so I
can't like link to her anything but
she's kind of doing me a favor and
helping design the wardress and then our
builders are just making them out of MDF
and we're just gonna paint them because
that's kind of the cheapest way to do
wardrobes especially if you're painting
them you don't really need them to be
made out of proper wood so I'm gonna
show you the designs for those and then
I think I'm gonna wrap up this video
because it's getting a little bit long I
feel like this one wasn't quite as
interesting as the first one because you
can't literally see as much happening
like when we built the extension it was
really exciting for is now they're kind
of putting in underfloor heating and
it's not stuff that you can really see
but hopefully the next video when things
start maybe getting like bathrooms to go
in and things might get decorated for
like the upstairs of the house is gonna
get done a lot quicker than the
downstairs because we have to wait for
things like doors in kitchens which kind
of delay the project there's always I
think a period of time during a
renovation where the builders can't
really do anything until certain stuff
like arrives so let me show you some
stuff that you might find interesting
sorry this is just on my phone but it's
the best way I can show you for now
so this is our downstairs toilet this is
where the sliding door is and this is
where the washer and dryer are gonna be
so I've already dirty nails it's gross
so as you see the toilets slightly to
the side because otherwise they'd be too
close to the sink so it's give me a
little bit of a gap here you might have
like a hanging plant or something and
the toilets built-in so it'd be a bit of
a Ledge back there and then we've got
the concrete sink on the wall with taps
and then a little rail for a towel so
this is the kind of design for the
toilet downstairs this is the design for
the upstairs bathroom so you walk in the
door we're switching the door round
there will be two sinks on the right
there with a mirrored cabinet the bath
going there across the window
Tweel affair we're having a bit of a
fancy toilet which I will talk you
through when it actually goes in rich
was desperate for this toilet and the
boil is gonna be above the toilet they
were gonna have a towel rail and then
like a walk-in shower with this that's
the kind of layout for the bathroom it
took us quite a while to figure out this
layout because it's a funny-shaped
bathroom but I think
it's gonna work really well under the
sinks we're having this like draw unit
and the Caesarstone works not the same
as our kitchen
Ripple's did some really great kind of
3d drawings which meant that we could
really see what the bottom was gonna
look like
these are little like recesses above the
bath and then for wardrobes this is a
very rough jewelry but we have the
chimney breasts in the middle we're
gonna be putting a TV on there so what
we've done is this is richer side it's
gonna have a mix of drawers and shelves
and two short hanging as some better top
for storage I wanted to go all the way
to the ceiling to get as much space as
possible and on my side I've got some
drawers shelves short hanging four tops
and jeans and trousers some long hanging
four dresses
bit of storage up there for some
handbags and storage by the top as well
and then in the middle these are
obviously going to be quite shallow
because of the chimney breasts but we're
gonna have a couple of drawers I think
and then just like open shelving haven't
quite decided whether to put doors or
non here because I'd need three doors
and it might be a bit busy so I might
just have open shelves I'm not sure yet
we're gonna decide that later so this is
the sort of thing we're gonna try and
build so I think I'm going to leave this
renovation vlog here I'm heading out of
the house later because I need to meet a
man with a drill who's gonna drill hole
into our like steel bath because our
builders were like we can't do that it's
quite risky I really hope the whole path
doesn't crack but apparently it's been
done before it's just so that we can
have a deck mounted shower when you like
one wash your hair or clean the bath and
so that's happening this afternoon and I
don't know what they're doing at the
house today but I guess I will start the
next vlog now so you will see that soon
I hope you guys enjoyed this video
I don't know let me know if you have any
other questions and I can answer them in
the next one I'm feeling a little bit
impatient now like I kind of it's at
that stage where there isn't like big
exciting things happening and I kind of
want to get back and I'm feeling a bit
like itchy living here now so yeah I'm
really looking forward to it being done
I'm also just really looking forward to
the floor going in I feel like that will
make me feel like it's more of a home we
also met up with a shutter man yesterday
to get a quote on some shutters so
that'll be cool
thanks for watching and I'll see you
guys in my next video sorry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
