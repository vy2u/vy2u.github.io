the 24th of July
I'm feeling pretty chirpy for a Monday
actually I thought I'd blog today
because as I said in my July favorites
video there might be a few more vlogs
around this end but I know you guys are
fine with that so thank you for all of
your comments on my July favorites video
it's 12 o'clock down so I've been
working all morning I got ready I've got
an event tonight quite exciting one
actually it's a glossier event I
actually can't wait to ask them is it
glossy er or glossy a that's going to be
my first question we're meeting the
founder Emily I can't wait glossy is
finally coming to the UK and they've
opened a showroom on Baker Street
why didn't open yet so that's where it
is the show because we're going through
a dinner there tonight and yeah I'm
really excited because you guys now I'm
really into the brand at the moment so
it will be great to chat about it and
hear about their plans for London and
then finally we can all get our hands on
the glossy a product without having to
go to New York so that's what I'm doing
tonight and then yeah and is going to be
there so it'd be nice to catch up with
her I'm going to my eyebrows done like
five o'clock at the blink brow bar in
Liberty they are in desperate need this
week is a bit crazy for me because it's
my best friend's hen this weekend the
one I've been talking about and planning
for so long is like taking over my life
or the stuff down here on the floor is
for the head my office is just full of
random stuff so really excited to that
when you guys watch this videos a hen
will be over and I'll be at a wedding or
wedding on Sunday after a two-day hen
I'm actually going to die angry so tired
but it's all very exciting so I've got
lots to do this week for that and I've
got lots of work on with them stuff so I
thought I would just Vogue today and get
it done at the beginning of the week
I've just straightened my hair and I'm
going to let it kind of rest for a bit
before I go in and add some waves and
hopefully they will last a bit longer
I'm wearing this top from Topshop which
I had for a while but I'm also wearing
like all of my Numa soma necklaces I've
got the little like Fang one this really
pretty little turquoise one I think
Ellimist sent me with a PR package and
in the horn
she'll wear all the time I also have
something really exciting to show you
guys I can't believe that I can finally
tell you about this so quite a while ago
when she was it
I don't remember that's really helpful
but Brides magazine got in touch with me
and they were like we would love to do a
piece on you and your wedding
I was like thank you so much I'm so
flattered but I feel like you guide them
already like seeing the wedding video I
just put them photos on my blog you kind
of know the deal when it comes to my
wedding what happened and everything
like that
so I just feel like that wasn't a very
interesting like angle and they said
well we're kind of up for anything what
would you like to do is we can kind of
collaborate somehow so I said well my
probably only regret from the whole
wedding process is that I didn't really
enjoy the whole wedding dress trying on
the thing and it was mainly because I
knew what budget I had which was quite
small and I knew what kind of dress I
wanted and what would go with the venue
you're kind of quite restricted on
budget and venue I think you know if I
tried on like a big princess dress and
fell in love with it I would have been
gutted because it just wouldn't have
gone with like barn wedding that I had
it was a very casual wedding so I kind
of just went to like I went to sample
sale it was absolute disaster everything
I tried on just looked like I was
playing fancy dress and then I went to
Kathryn Dean which is where I got my
dress and like the first one I tried on
I did all dance in it I felt great and I
was like this is perfect and it was like
under budget and it was great and that's
kind of it and I think after the wedding
was over my only regret was I didn't
really get to enjoy her I didn't like
take all my friends and everything I
mean they came to see my dress but I
didn't try on any ridiculous dresses you
know it's not like how you imagined it
is in the films and you're trying on a
million different dresses and you're
just having a great time you kind of
don't want to let yourself fall in love
with something that might not fit so I
kind of wished that I tried on a big
princess dress because you're only
really ever going to get to do that once
I told them this and they were like that
would make such a good piece for the
magazine you try on all these different
dresses that are completely different to
the actual dressing you've got and just
kind of seeing what you think of them I
was like this is an actual dream like
who gets a second opportunity to try on
wedding dresses and they're already
married that's what we did and we had
the most amazing shoot day the stylist
was great I loved her and I tried on all
these crazy dresses guys some of them
were like 8,000 pounds it was insane I
had such a fun time a lot of them are
like sample sizes so they were like
really really tight and some definitely
didn't suit me thank God I came away
from the day still still feeling like my
dress that I wore my actual wedding was
my
because that would have been really
worrying but I did try on some
incredible dresses there was some big
poufy princess ones there was like a
drop waist short one with ostrich
feathers which was I think the most
expensive
I loved it made me realize how much I
love drop waist which is why I then went
on to buy a sauce dress that I keep
wearing all the time it was such a fun
day and I have the magazine here they've
just sends it to me so I can actually
show you guys a little bit inside first
of all I'm going to do before I show you
a peek inside is insert some footage
from the actual shoot day because I
filmed on the day I'd keep all secret at
the time but I filmed in the day and I
kept the footage so that I could put it
in a vlog when the magazine came out so
I hope you enjoy having a little sneak
peek into the shoot that I did Brides
magazine and I'm going to insert footage
now I just arrived at the studio and I'm
really excited and we just consulting
hair and makeup I'm going to go try
stuff out good luck
so the lady that has to try and do
something with this thing which is
having some fruits and complete my mom's
actually coming to join me the doubtful
areas she never caught anything my work
related so I thought of trying on
wedding dresses so I have my mom here
but if we didn't really do this first
time around I tried on like three
dresses so she a lot bit I told her
she's not allowed to tell me when I look
all booked and after she does she'll be
like I was not to use all the makeup
brushes here
you
Hongki lovely we've let our God go and
tour the city LA which is breaking to
the lunch so far my favorite wanted a
short one with the ostrich feathers I
love that you are call me a better
company
this is the magazine I love it pink I'm
going to show you a little peek inside

like this when it says 1 by 16 gowns you
decide that's me that's me okay I need
to find it ok so if you go to page 1 5 9

picture of me enriched and then I'm just
going to show you one photo this is the
low-cut color injection this dress oh my

just so excited about this it's always
weird seen photos of yourself that you

want to go and get Brides magazine and
have a little look it's out now it's
been about 4 hours since I last vlog so
I've just been working away at my
computer and now it's 4 o'clock so I'm
going to head into town for my
appointment at 5:00 can't wait to get my
brows done they're going to look a
little bit red but at least they won't
look overgrown and then I've got a bit
of time in between so I think I'll go to
a few shops because I haven't been to
shops in like a month it feels like it's
just been a funny time of you and
actually even now still sales on but I
just feel like the weather has cooled
down massively in London in the UK in
general so I need to buy different
clothes to it I don't know I'm just
going to have a little browse I think
and see what's around it's been a weird
day because I know I'm going outside
