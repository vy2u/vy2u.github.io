and I'm up really early because we're
going to record another podcast this
week has been crazy we've had three
which is quite a busy week I don't think
that's going to be normal going forward
I hope not being on I've been on lots of
late-night calls trying to like plan
each episode and do lots of research but
today we are going to meet someone we've
met before but that we really admire and
I'm just so excited to hang out with her
I've just done my makeup and I've tried
to do it very well because I would like
to impress this lady and I'm just having
a quick bite to eat well so these
arrived yesterday the mattes long calm
they're like the juicy shakers that
matte so I'm going to give that a go in
a minute later I'm going to get my hair
done her since I can't wait I know you
guys have been complimenting me a lot on
my hair recently and I also really like
the length I'm going to tell them to
keep the length I just want like a trim
but it needs something because it's
really hard for dial and also any of my
gray hairs covered you are why I think
that's all I've got to update you on now
I picked up these flowers yesterday to
give our guests you would like to turn
off the flowers because I think going to
someone's home without flowers in this
case is kind of rude these are
procedures actually quite scared I was
in charge of this one Anna's way better
at flowers than I am I think they did
well I've just put on shade 270 I don't
know if it's my color a little bit
Coralie but I just really want to try it
smells amazing of course I use the liner
first which i think is key because that
advocate is quite large so you can't do
like a precise finish and also if you
use a liner there's less lip to fill in
so use the liner and then I just kind of
swipes this over it goes on really wet
like a liquid I'm just waiting to see
how fast it dries down it's taking a
little while I can't feel it drying and
it's not like crazy Matt it's it's a
nice kind of glowy Matt I think I really
like this we shall see I also have the
shades I got damaged and if it's the
full collection but I didn't love the
shades but I've got a nice red here and
then a kind of more peachy nude
here I found Anna in a press
she's very tired I mean I woke up on
holidays let me talk about like our
5-part my passions all of them just yeah
and as I talk to London a lot for me but
we are both feeling like this just in
like a tired way we've got them with us
famous are we come out sticks and sushi
because it's our favorite especially
when we want to have something special
on here oh yeah that's good I can't
think like I really have any writing so
sort of had it last night puzzling
planet Oh YUM this is the Hell's Kitchen
oh my god incredible thank you my
favorite sushi ever yes oh I love it
the tuna in the tempura shrimp and an
avocado and then a little spicy barbecue
I'm now in Harvey Nichols heading up -
you were decided that we like the lakes
and the color of my hair this is coming
in a refreshingly this color is going to
come in and add a few layers I just got
home and I don't know when I last vlog I
kind of forgot to vlog sorry about that
but my hair is done it always looks
different when you kind of get the
hairdresser to do it but I got the color
just refreshed we decided not to get too
high I got my grades covered but we left
that kind of my natural color and just
put in a bit more lighter color here but
not too light and then Sean cut it we
said we really liked the length so we
kept the length just kind of tidied it
up a bit added a few layers because it
gets a bit flat at the end of the day
I'm a bit like hot sweaty from the tube
I'm just making me enriched some dinner
I've got a lot of work to do tonight
so it's rich actually but I want to eat
healthy huh we've got oh well I just got
it
anyway I was saying I'm trying to eat
healthy because I have a photo shoot on
Tuesday that I need to not wear many
types for that makes it sound bad it's
not like a native shoot but I just
suddenly realized like what am i doing I
need to eat healthy this weekend and
exercise or do something to help it I'm
making some fun and then we've got over
here some salad I'm skipping
cucumber tomatoes and then his broccoli
is I'm going to seem like the microwave
this is what we've got salmon salad
broccoli running myself nice Bob and the
day we use in it and see this is a
products mayhem in here oh I think we
need their nails yard foaming bath you
can't see it but probably that's what it
is
I'm going to sign off today and take
your hot dog dance bar so I will see
them good morning everyone it is Friday
morning I am so so tired today I feel
really really tired I gave myself a
little mini lion I'm now going to make
some breakfast I think I'm gonna make
some avocado on toast that's all I've
got to update you on right now yeah
record I wasn't ripe so I'm going to
scrambled eggs instead Hannah and I are
meeting up again this afternoon to
record another podcast for the special
guests and so I'm going to sit and do
some work now I'm also really excited
for tonight remember I told you guys I
was going to see John Mayer well
originally me and my mom and dad and my
friend Gemma had tickets for last night
we got them like ages ago but then
really last minute Oh - offered me a box
and like enough seats to invite friends
and family which is crazy like I never
ever get plus ones and especially like
more than plus one and to a concert I
agreed you really want to go - I love
John Mayer so my dad went last night
with some friends and I'm now going
tonight instead my dad's coming again
and loads of friends of ours and we're
going to be in a box watching John Mayer
who I just love his music so I'm so
excited - that that's happening tonight
thank you very much - OH - and now I'm
just sit and do some work I just part of
my last Revlon video and you guys are
leaving me lovely comments thanks for
that right masculine okay I am now off
to record third podcast for this week I
think this one is going to be more of
like a business each hat it's going to
be really interesting actually to see
your reaction because I think each guest
is really different and I think there
will be some you guys are like really
close at about in the some that you may
not know that person but hopefully
you'll still listen anyway and you might
learn something really interesting out
of it it's just a massive mix obviously
when we approach other guests this
podcast didn't even exist so season two
might be really different we don't
really know but I do think every episode
will be quite different to the last this
one is more of a business each apt
from where in my MLS Co it's raining I
just echo umbrella a Gucci bag and this
white t-shirt some hush this necklace is
from the soma this necklace is from
Madhuri
good and then I got these jeans
yesterday from Topshop they've got this
like frame bear the bottom I'm really
liking I'm wearing my Topshop belt and
my jigsaw boots I'm going to head off
come accord a podcast just Melbourne
Anna she's got some lovely flowers okay
right like this
I specifically finished recording the
podcast and and it dragged me in Space
NK because she was by about 100 miles
off their album yes okay we're off to
John Mayer Richard Elam you have me
taken out for oh say thank you
who's about my friend Rob and had a beer
in the pub which is nice

these people and it was finished and I'm
weird ever met and I asked them exciting
I will no one with problems like pop and

it's so exciting we're in the box and
I'm with 13 friends I feel so lucky
right now let me show you the amazing
this is a book and everything you don't
mind if they just write that
this is the hallway close thanks to a
stasis
Oh
I was so so good I loved it it was I've
never really been to a concert like
actually it was kind of like a story he
did it in three sections he did like
full band a full section full band
acoustic trio and then full band again
and then he did it alone again it was
like it was like going to four different
concerts or something it was brilliant
at the end he had made rolling credits
of everyone involved in the production
include like security videography like
everything which I thought was so nice
he acknowledged everyone's behind the
scenes as like works so hard on the
whole production I think he's great he
is insane at Nick Toth I love all of his
songs I'm just like buzzing it was a
really really good concert wishes you to
it yeah and II really enjoyed it I'm
glad we contracts on them yeah I love
him he's just and also we're seeing it
my dad went last night and normally with
the customers is the same every night
but he said the setlist was completely
different last night which I was a bit
gutted about at first when I heard
because he's some daughters last night
which is like my favorite song and he
didn't sing it tonight which I was
gutted about but at the end I spoke to
my dad and he said it was so much better
tonight he thought you must have learned
from his mistakes last night apparently
a lot of things didn't really work last
night and it seemed a bit weird and it
was a weird choice of songs so I'm
really happy to live the good night and
it was so cool to be in a box
I just spokes a lot but I'm really happy
okay
we're home and we're going to end this
