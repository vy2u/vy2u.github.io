video at the end of moving day was a
good idea I'll never know so we have
moved whoo I'm just gonna have a sip if
you saw my Instagram on Friday I
announced it's not really announcement
that me and Richard moving today is
moving day
we've moved we've officially moved I
know it looks like the same server but
it's in a different place it's in a
house now I've actually been vlogging
all week which is what you're gonna see
today in this video so and I can't
really remember what I have what I've
said and what I haven't because I
haven't managed to edit it yet so I'm
sorry if I repeat myself but we have
moved we have moved from our two bird
flat into a house like a grown-up house
it's crazy we were in our flat for two
years which isn't really that long and
but I guess I moved out of my parents
house when I was 28 so and I'm 30 it was
a good good time to have a house and
it's been quite a long process we put
off flat on the market in May was it May
so it's been pretty like long but then
it all kind of sped up loads at the end
it's such a weird thing like we put our
hat on the market and then the general
election happened and it was just a very
funny time so I didn't say earlier
because we didn't really know what was
gonna happen whether we were actually
gonna move it was kind of like we talked
about it ages and then we actually did
it and then we found the perfect place
it has been a stressful week moving
trying to do this and kind of work and
everything at the same time it's been
crazy but I'm happy to be here we've
been working like crazy today to unpack
and try and make it feel homely what can
I say we have bought a Dewar upper
definitely do offer and I think that's
quite normal for like your second place
with our flat the developer had done it
up before so a path must lean to paint
it white it was all done and I was
exactly what I needed then I just was so
busy with work I just wanted somewhere I
could move into but with this place is
like probably gonna be like a 10-year er
so we had to get somewhere that needed
work so it's not like it's in good
condition but it's not to our taste at
all and we're not going to be able to do
it off straightaway maybe like within
six months we could maybe start thinking
about it but as of now we just have to
live with it as it is when we moved in
that they had wallpaper everywhere like
red red wallpaper on one wall yellow on
the other and then purple stripy
wallpaper in the hallway and I was like
I really can't deal with that but
there's no point us like getting someone
to strip the wallpaper or us to in
ourselves and replastering the walls
in six months time we're going to
hopefully do up the whole house
so we just painted over it so it all
looks a bit shabby our furniture doesn't
really fit but it's so exciting anyway
and yeah we have really exciting plans
to hopefully one day like extend the
downstairs and give ourselves a really
nice big kitchen with an island and all
these cool things but you have to save
up and kind of do it as we can as we go
over the years really so it's not like
beautiful like instagram-worthy
but it's just I love it anyway it's very
exciting
it's got weird things everywhere like
weird kind of like this like weird film
on the windows that looks like some old
granny lady print very gothic fireplaces
like black and gold I'm not sure if we
would keep those it's just all these
like funny little things all they're
like electrics or on the skirting board
we'll need to redo all the electrics at
some point there's a cat flap in the
back door we've had to cover up it's
very exciting and this week's video is
gonna be kind of moving vlogs and yes I
probably will do lots of home content
from now on because my channel has
always been a self named Channel Lily
pebbles it is whatever I'm into at the
time and now I've moved I'm very much
into kind of homey stuff so I probably
will be doing lots of home content and I
hope you guys like that so I really hope
you guys enjoy this vlog let's go good
morning everyone it is Sunday and we
have the keys a week early we're very
lucky because no one's living in the
house so we've been given the keys early
only to do like certain things but one
of the things we really want to do
before we put all our furniture in there
move all our boxes in is paint the
downstairs at the moment it's red
wallpaper on one wall yellow on the
other and then purple stripy textured
wallpaper up the hallway but we have
plans till I completely renovate the
house especially downstairs in like
maybe six months time so for us there's
no point like getting a decorator and
strip the wallpaper and like resurface
the walls and do it properly because
we're then gonna rip it all down anyway
so even though it's a really weird thing
to do we're just gonna paint over the
wallpaper for now because for me I just
can't live in a house with that
wallpaper so we've got wallpaper paint
and we just gonna paint over it white
eventually I don't think we'll actually
have it white that's probably a bit
going to be a bit like bright and like
plain
but for now we're just basically
deleting the wallpaper painting those
white we have no one helping us I've
asked all my friends and family to help
us pain and no one wants to I don't
blame them so it's just me and rich I've
got a little bit of bad back so I'm
hoping we can actually get this done
today and it's my nephew's birthday this
afternoon like his birthday tea so we
haven't got long okay we're heading over
to the house with a massive ladder which
is very excited this the first time he's
ever been able to buy a ladder because
we had nowhere nowhere to keep one in
the flat
you like my outfit guys I actually
thought it was getting really hard to
cover this red but this paint is really
good since a wallpaper cover-up it's
actually working but it's really weird
paint that like solidifies and water
just kind of makes us spread more over
your hands so I'm gonna look very
interesting at babies but they take this
afternoon I've got this very flattering
everyone try not to get all in my hair
cuz it's so hard to get out carry on
even small even when the stones over
here we still doing the first coat on
now onto this yellow but the red wool
has the first coat which is taking down
the curtains Mike is killing me
but looking better already okay it's
getting dark now I just went to baby's
birthday tea and we're doing the second
coat of white it's not gonna look
perfect but it's absolutely fine for now
and it's just just going and doing a bit
so I can't reach god it's made me
realize how unripe the ceiling is but
we're just leaving that for now okay now
we're gonna try and tackle this
wallpaper and we're gonna leave the
textured wallpaper moving they're both
textured we hate them all we're gonna
get rid of them all eventually but we're
gonna leave that for now we even gonna
leave they're like green wood parts
we're just gonna do one coat of this
wallpaper because I really I'd prefer
just like funny white paint than this so
this is gonna be my corner I'm gonna
work here and try and get one coat done
it's like 5:30 now
you just wanna drink - beer and garlic
yeah
we are shattered after a really long day
of painting it is Wednesday and I am
basically starting to pack up our
bathroom I'm feeling a bit panicky that
we're quite behind schedule which only
has Thursday and Friday off work and
we're moving on Friday and there's a lot
going on on Thursday so I'm trying to
encourage us to start packing in the
evenings rich is currently sitting on
the sofa eating crisps while I'm doing
the bathroom I've basically grabbed all
of my makeup bags see this is why it's
good that I hoard makeup bags so now
they're coming in handy especially the
glossy er ones I'm packing them and I'm
gonna put fragile on certain I think
smashes anything that has like an open
lid I've been rapping with cellotape
so I just need to finish doing this
luckily I actually had a clear-out
recently so I haven't got much stuff
this is kind of mmm that's kind of mine
and then this is rich so I'm just gonna
go through these cupboards now and yeah
pack everything into this box here oh so
my the only person that then you hoard
star importance I realized one day I had
so many I put them in slit foot sandwich
bags and literally have like look how
many green ones I have oh my god like
every time I get my beard I just buy
more tampons or it's just like you don't
need to buy any more you have more
tampons than you'll ever need
it's literally ridiculous tampons
everywhere I made some good progress
tonight this is the Box situation in
this room so we're kind of running out
of space and my office is full of boxes
but slowly getting there this is what my
office looks like at the moment very
cramped in here
I just watched Megan Ella B's movie
vlogs and thought how the hell does she
look so good when she was moving she had
like proper makeup done and a hair look
normal look at me it's Wednesday
I cried three times today I don't know
why I think I'm just a little bit a
little bit stressed there's lots of like
work stuff going on which I'm finding
difficult balance with house stuff but
rich is on his way back from work and I
packed up a few more boxes today
oh god my lips are so sore everything
just gets sore when I'm stressed and
yeah I'm gonna just keep packing I feel
like we're not really getting anywhere
but I know that we have to be because of
packing boxes so surely this stuff is
going somewhere
look how bear the shelves are in my
office so sad we like had all this stuff
built my office
I feel sad leaving it I'm definitely
starting to feel more emotional now
about leaving the flat I had any
thoughts about it much like I love this
place it's the first home in which got
together and so much happened here
including rich proposing to me
physically in this flat so it's like
kind of bittersweet leaving it I'm
obviously really excited for our next
place but it's not like in our first
move we were just so happy to like not
be living at home with my parents and to
have our own place I was a bit nervous
the first time around about being
homesick but I was just so excited was
now it's like I'm excited but I'm also
sad to be leaving this place because I
do love it it's just we've outgrown it
yeah what am i packing now lots of
advent calendars and stuff and it's like
bit I've got just bits in my office
everywhere and I'm like I keep seeing
things and thinking oh my god I put a
pack that and like shoes and stuff
literally everything is just such a mess
the makeup packing begins I've put
everything into sandwich bags like this
and then we're gonna put some bubble
wrap so they're hopefully they don't
will smash I become very good at making
up boxes I say as I struggle oh my god
I'm looking forward to not doing this
again for a very long time it's funny I
was messaging Anna today and she said
don't you remember when I moved I cried
for two weeks and actually I do remember
she cried for two weeks I don't know why
I think it's just like quite an
emotional thing and you're just so tired
like physically tired you know I'm not
used to like doing physical thing okay
box made well my Liberty advent calendar
literally fits like a glove I really
found that quite satisfying
today it is Thursday oh my god my face
I'm just breaking out allergies
everywhere from like the stress and the
dust like my lips
and my I are so sore look at that ah
anyway I look like a mess we're on our
way to being cute we need to get toilet
seat with the toilet seat I mean I
always think when you move into a new
place you should get a new toilet seat
but this one is particularly gross so
we're definitely getting a toilet see we
need to get some blinds in the meantime
just so we can sleep tomorrow night
without waking up really early well so
we're giving light bulbs that's the plan
now and then take all those things to
the house and then finish packing we've
got a lot of packing to do today
we've got this to cover up the old cap
wrap we've got a new toilet seat and
then loads of random things
oK we've come back to the flat taking
all my makeup off because my face is so
itchy I'm gonna keep on packing up the
kitchen because you've got some extra
stuff to pack and I think I'll just
leave you guys here to watch another
time-lapse
it
she currently got the takeaway going
we're literally sitting amongst the
boxes and there's nothing to cook with
we flip she's got those two balls left
and some cutlery hmm
Friday and it's moving day me rich I've
had one argument already and it's half
eight and but we're doing well but lots
of Vaseline on my lips right just taking
the TV and stuff down and there's just
stuff everywhere literally everywhere
just packed up with the last box it's my
bedroom I'm about to do the last one in
the office
and they're making removable skies
they're gonna arrive in a minute I feel
like we haven't had our like oh my last
moment and the flat maybe when they take
a little stuff out and flats empty yeah
we can like give it a little like pound
the wall I'm gonna miss these shutters
that we spend an absolute fortune on I
feel like you've only just finished
paying off for them we have to leave
them and look at the beautiful light
that they make one day I will have my
sister's back in my life one of the
rooms has been cleared very echoey in
here Wow it looks big bathroom is empty
but it's a young couple moving in so
I've left my copperfield sticker in the
shower so that she remembers the check
her boobs so I'll show you what our
wardrobes look like Quinn there's no
clothes it's very clever
we had some drawers down there and then
the top is literally just this bracket
stuck on the wall with this pipe in this
pipe coming out and then these dividers
so this is what it looks like and that
was her wardrobe that's literally all
the space we had for our clothes I'm
gonna get war Joe's built the new place
but not for a while so we're just using
the wood ribs they have there for now
like this room is empty so weird
everything's pretty much empty now I'm
gonna leave these mirrors these we got
from Ikea people always ask me they're
like eight stick on mirrors this is our
bedroom
feels like two years ago when we moved
in but a bit dustier which is filling
all the holes for the new people we've
filled with the holes but we didn't have
time to like sand them down so I've left
and we basically left the keys this is
really sad and we've left some sand
paper and I said hi we filled all the
holes but didn't dry in time so just use
this sand paper to sand them down enjoy
your new home we got engaged here so I
hope it brings you lots of good memories
too we don't even have one of these in
our new fund or we're gonna leave my
zoella and Reed diffusers down here
okay well the keys some of the
furnitures gone in but it's still chaos
so many boxes if you do if so long we
haven't even finished the kitchen it's
like I'm going to be here all night
and all weekend we're gonna put some
music on this is the most exciting thing
about moving I'm not even joking it's
one of my top things I've been looking
forward to I have one of these massive
massive dipti candles and a jello one
and I've been saving it for like this
one not for so long down below one for
years I've been saving it for when I
have a house I can actually burn this
candle now because that would have just
been overpowering for my flat I'm very
very excited about this okay family have
come in and out all day and been helping
us and very kind my dad's on his way now
we've decided to stop with the
downstairs we're gonna go up and do a
bedroom because I know I'm gonna get
tired and then I'm just gonna be sad I
haven't got a bedroom that feels like I
want to sleep in it so we're gonna go
like make the bed and like unpack our
clothes and try and do as much as we can
this is the current state of bedroom
with like random pieces of carpet
missing okay let's do this also smells
still smells funky in here even though
we cleaned it so I've got a little
candle burning over there
okay everyone has left us and now we're
just gonna live in our house I don't
know what we do I guess we gonna get
