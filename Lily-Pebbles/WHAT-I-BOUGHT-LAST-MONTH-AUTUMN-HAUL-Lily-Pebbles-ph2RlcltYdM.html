a haul video and showing you everything
I bought throughout October because I
wasn't making any videos so I did do a
bit of shopping and I obviously wasn't
able to share those things with you guys
so I kept a list on my phone so I could
do a little haul when I got back and I
was gonna do a vlog for today's video
but I'm just working from home today and
I haven't got anything to vlog so I
thought I would do like an old-school
haul
I've got mainly style like fashion stuff
for this video but I've got a few beauty
bits to show you as well okay let me
start with coats because I got two coats
last month and I'm kind of obsessed with
both of them first one you would have
already seen all over my Instagram and
trust me you will get bored of this
because I'm gonna wear it to death
because when I get a coat that I like I
obviously wear it a lot that's what it's
for this one is from Topshop and it's a
checked coat and I saw so many people
especially like fashion bloggers wearing
checked Blazers and I kind of struggle
with Blazers I did really want one but
then it kind of got to the point in the
UK especially where the weather kind of
changed and it got a lot colder and I
thought there's no point getting a
blazer because I'm gonna have to wear it
under a coat so I saw this one Topshop
and thought that is the perfect
compromise because I still get that look
but it can actually be my like outerwear
so I really like this it's
double-breasted I always wear our undone
it's kind of oversized and really long
which is how I really like my coats I'll
add in a little cutaway here so you can
see what it looks like on you guys have
seen this plenty of times but this is
what the code looks like I just love it
so much it's got the kind of old grandpa
feel to it I really like the check it's
right inoffensive and it goes to just
below my knee which is a really good
length it's got pockets you can see the
buttons I just think it's so smart but
not like overly small yeah I really
really like okay the next coat is from
whistles and I really wanted a new
Parker I used to have one from whistles
I bought maybe five years ago that was
Karki green and I loved it it looked
really cool but it was actually quite
thin so it didn't actually keep me warm
in like autumn winter so I gave that one
to my sister and I invested in a new one
and I know this is gonna last me for at
least another five years it's got a
really nice faux fur hood and a brown
kind of furry
hood as well and then it's just a black
Parker but what I really like is the
inside is line so it's so warm it's
perfect for going for walks I go for
walks in the weekend or just kind of the
less smart day so I'm not going to
meetings and stuff and I just want to be
warm it gets so cold here in the winter
so I'm really happy that I've got a
winter coat and it's also I don't know
if it's like waterproof but it's
definitely a water-resistant it's got
that kind of shiny material which means
the rain will kind of I slip off it I
literally can't hear a thing this is
what it looks like with the hood up I
look like a crazy wild animal but this
sort it's like with the hood down it's
so warm I like that it's not too long
it's just too below the bomb because I
think if it was long there but just like
overtake my whole body I also really
like how it's got sleeves like this
because my other one didn't and then all
the wind kind of throws off your arms it
also got these really big pockets which
really go specially if you are a dog
walker it's so cozy
okay now let's give into some clothes
and I picked up quite a few jumpers
obviously the weather has got a lot
colder and all I tend to wear this time
of year is jeans jumper and I don't
really mind because you can still make
that look cool if you just get some
really nice jumpers I really wanted to
get another red knit I'm really into red
at the moment I used to hate red I used
to always say that red made my like
eyebrows bushier and my hair frizzier in
it because I've got such dark features I
used to find the contrast it's just too
much but I don't know why I've got back
into red again and I really like it I
specially love it with blue denim this
jumper is from Topshop yeah I got it in
a 10
I'm usually a 10 to 12 but it depends on
what the item is like in top coat I got
12 because I knew I'd want to layer over
jumpers but in this jumper I probably
will either wear over a t-shirt or over
nothing so I got it in a 10 it's this
really pretty red knit like quite a
chunky knit as well but then the arms
like bellow out into I don't know what
the official term is but it just has
like really cool detail into it and then
the sleeves roll up what I also really
like about this jumper is it's cropped
it's not too cropped that you have to
like show your tummy but it's cropped
enough that you don't have to tuck it
into jeans because I find it quite hard
to tuck in at jump is this thick into
jeans so it sits perfectly with
high-waisted jeans and I've been wearing
this loads since I got it as you can see
the arms are quite
big which I really like it's just a
really relaxed fit but then the actual
body fits really nicely and it crops
just kind of just below where my jeans
do up which is the perfect length I
really like the neck on this and the
kind of chunky knit it's very
comfortable to wear that's what it looks
like from further away the next jump is
from whistles I picked this up on ASOS I
think this was quite expensive but the
material is so so nice what is it made
out of I think it's a mix of wool oh
yeah it's a mix it's 95% wool in 5%
cashmere so it's got this really nice
neckline and then it's kind of back wing
and then again it's crop although this
one is thin enough that you can tuck it
into jeans it's not a thick jumper so
you can wear it over t-shirts but I just
love the way it hangs and sits and again
I've been wearing this one to death
since I got it this is what the whistles
one that looks like my hair hidden
neckline is really flattering and what
I've done now is just tucked in one a
little side but you can actually tuck in
the whole jumper quite easily it's got
big sleeves like batwing but you can
also fold them up it's very relaxed fit
and easy so you can make roll up the
sleeves and it hangs really nicely so
that is what the whistles jumper looks
like I'm so in love with this one this
jump I was actually gifted next asked if
I wanted to pick anything from their
website and I asked if they could send
me this but I wanted to show you guys
because it is so nice I've got this in a
10 it's 25 pounds I think
and it's very colorful for me it's got
one of those kind of I don't know what
those are called funnel neck I think
where it's not quite like as high as a
turtleneck because that I find so
claustrophobic but just goes up a little
bit which is really flattering it's got
green grey kind of red grey and pink
stripes so many colors but they all work
so nicely together it's such a nice that
autumn color palette this one isn't
quite as soft actually it's definitely
not as soft as the whistles one and it's
not as kind of just feeling the tops on
the top Sean doesn't really feel of
anything this one has like a tiny bit of
itchiness to it if you're very sensitive
to HD fabrics you might find this too
itchy I normally am quite sensitive and
I think if I wore this over a t-shirt so
it was just kind of touching my arms I
think it'll be fine it's not like I'm
bare ibly edgy but it is a little bit
yeah but it looks so nice I think that
looks
nice like tucked into jeans for like a
weekend or Tom Nell walk I love the
colors on this one and actually I think
I would leave it untucked I like how the
sleeves go out and I think it's
flattering
sometimes stripes can make you look
quite big but I don't think this one
does I just love the mix of colors it's
actually not very itchy once it's on
it's just a shot further back for you to
see what it looks like this t-shirt as
well I've been wearing it a lot since I
got it
tucking it into jeans this is one of the
whistles t-shirts I find that the fit of
the whistles teachers are so nice
because they're loose and kind of heavy
so they just hang really nicely sorry
this kind of needs ironing
it's a white t-shirt and then it says in
black embroidery
Jinna SiC WA and it's simple and classic
and it goes with everything this has
just been my uniform like this jeans and
the whistles gray jumper I have worn so
much I also got this from ASOS this
t-shirt is just so comfortable I love
the length of the sleeves I love how it
looks tucked in and the writing just
there it's just so easy to wear I mean
this definitely needs an iron but that's
what it looks like
am i usually wear like this tucked into
jeans the next item are some trousers
and I never wear trousers as I said I
wear jeans all the time but I saw these
in Topshop and I thought I'll give them
a go I always want to try out trousers
just in case I find the right ones and
these fit really well so I'm so happy I
did they are black and white checked I
think that's what it's called and
they're really high-waisted which is why
I think they work they kind of cinch in
and they've got this detailing and then
they're just very loose and they roll up
at the bottom and I find that I can wear
these with like a little cropped jumper
I haven't really managed to figure out
how to like tuck in a jumper but I can
wear like these with a little white
t-shirt tucked in and then a jumper I
don't know I'm still trying to work out
the trouser thing but I have worn these
with my orange Topshop jumper like an
old one and that worked really nicely
and I wore it with high boots but I
think these soft risers can be worn with
trainers as well so I'm happy I've got a
good pair of trousers in my collection
because I don't have many of them so
this is the trousers with the orange
tops of jumpers telling you about so
they're just really relaxed fits very
comfortable but they've also kind of go
in at the waist here which means if you
want to talk
in there quite flattering they're
probably not the most flattering
charles's I've ever bought but I kind of
like them they're just easy to wear so
I'm moving around so much it's really
hard to show you like by the way the
links all of these products are going to
be linked below in the description box
and if they are sold out or particularly
expensive I'll try and find an
alternative link as well this one I've
been arming and Ari Nova I don't I think
I might have passed my like return date
now anyway but I wanted to have
something possibly for Christmas party
I've definitely got one Christmas party
coming up and there's always last-minute
invites and I haven't really got
anything this is a jumpsuit from Topshop
and it's black with white polka dots I
absolutely love polka dot print
especially this kind of like uneven
polka dot this is really nice it has
sleeves like this and then it has kind
of off the shoulder sleeve which is
really good if you don't kind of like
that part of your arm which I don't mind
but it kind of makes me feel I don't
like having too much skin out and then
it's got a tie around the waist I love
everything about it but the sleeves I
find really restricting like when
they're on I can't like I wouldn't be
able to go and hug someone and it's not
the size because the size of the
jumpsuit fits everywhere else and I
actually spoke to a lady who worked in
Topshop and she said she finds this a
lot with these kind of jumpsuits
it's very restricting on the arm and I
wasn't sure whether to go and see if I
can get it like tailored somewhere or
just like grin and bear it because maybe
sometimes when you wear a nice outfit
it can't be perfectly comfortable I
don't know I really like it so I didn't
want to take it back I'll try it on and
show you guys what I mean
but I think I'm gonna try and make it
work it just maybe won't be something I
wear all the time
yeah I would definitely wear this with a
strapless bra this is what the jumpsuit
looks like I think it's really I keep
going to put my hand in the pocket there
isn't any pockets it's a really nice
length nice kind of floating material
won't get sweaty in it it's got this
nice tie I like the sleeves and I like
the neckline and like you can see if I
went bigger these sleeves would be huge
for me but it's this bit I can't I can't
like put my arms forward it's very hard
and weird to explain but I like it so
much I think I'm just gonna wear it and
try not to move my arms because I can
kind of move them like that high and
that far forward just I can't do big
movements because it's kind of tight at
the back I think it's just kind of badly
made
topshop so donno what you can expect if
this was like everything expensive
jumpsuit it would fit like a glove
probably but I really like it I haven't
seen anything else like it so I keep
hold of it this is what it looks like
all in one looks a bit like pajamas okay
that's everything for fashion now on to
beauty I did pick up a few things
throughout the month first of all from
glossy a glossy a launched in the UK so
they now do shipping to the UK and
that's very exciting although I kind of
have everything I need there was only
two things I wanted to order first of
all the super pure serum I didn't get
this when I went to the showroom because
I don't really tend to have spotty skin
apart from now I don't know if you can
see this giant spot on my chin but I
usually get spotty once a month when I'm
hormonal and I thought it'd be good to
have a serum like this for when that
happens I really like it I find that I
don't need it all over my skin so I just
put like one drop and then I just pull
up my chin around my nose or wherever I
get spotty and then I'll put a hydrator
hydrating serum elsewhere but it's a
really nice really nice serum it says it
calms breakout prone calms breakout
prone skin and redness so Anna uses this
for her redness and I've been enjoying
that the other thing I got from glossier
is the body hero shower oil they
launched a few new body products I
didn't get the moisturizer because I
don't always moisturize my skin I try to
and I want to but I don't know I wasn't
sure I hadn't smelled the scent yet I
probably would order the body
moisturizer and now I've tried this this
is the daily oil wash and I love a
shower oil I think they're so luxurious
this one's really nice and love that it
comes with a pump it's so easy to use
and obviously the packaging is very cute
so I keep this in my shower rub it all
over my skin and it kind of lavas up and
it smells like it smells like rose
really really nice rose actually yeah I
really like that we went to the ordinary
store in Spitalfields market I really
like ordinary they've got some great
skincare and when I went the first time
around they were sold out the foundation
so I was really excited that they
actually had stock this time so I got
one of each the coverage foundation and
the serum foundation they're like $4.99
each they are so affordable and I
haven't quite decided yet how I feel
about them I got two point zero neutral
that's the shade that suits me they're
very helpful in the store very helpful
and getting you matched as well
packaging wise can you see how grubby
this is because it's like a matte black
with a foundation
a bit of a disaster but I guess you can
clean it up the serum foundation is very
light it's like a liquid which makes it
quite hard to kind of put it on your
hands before you apply it but it's a
really nice makeup no makeup makeup look
when you don't want to wear much
foundation and then the coverage
foundation is quite similar I find to
the it cosmetics I think if you have
really dry skin it can look quite cakey
but I have managed to make this work so
I can't decide which one I like because
they both have their pros and their cons
for me so I'm still giving them a go and
I will let you know the final thing for
beauty I picked up the other day from
the Suzanne pop-up shop in London it's
on South Molton Street
I love Suzanne and Anna took me to the
New York store when we were there and I
just fell in love so I picked up the
Valkyria Bell Korea / Rose candle oh my
god I can smell it already
it's so good let me open it up it's a
mix of peach green fig and tobacco leaf
dreamy combination first we'll look at
this candle it's like a matte blush pink
and the actual candle is pink as well it
smells incredible like I really want to
pick up another one just in case like
it's only a pop-up shop and they're only
gonna be there till like mid-december
and I'm worried that I'll finish this
and then I'll just miss it it smells so
good if that burns the same way that it
smells I would say that's one of my like
all-time favorite candle scents kind of
want like a perfume version of it and I
think that's everything for my haul yeah
that's everything I picked up in October
so don't worry you didn't miss anything
else that was all the shopping I did and
I'm really happy with my wardrobe at the
moment I'm enjoying this time of year
where it's getting colder but it's not
like unbearably cold yet and it's so
pretty
and all the leaves of fall alone I love
autumn so I'm kind of terrified of when
winter comes properly and I just want to
wear like a big cozy coat all the time
but I hope you guys enjoyed today's
video don't forget to check out the
description box for all the links and I
think I'm gonna see you on Wednesday for
my next video
so I'll see you then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
