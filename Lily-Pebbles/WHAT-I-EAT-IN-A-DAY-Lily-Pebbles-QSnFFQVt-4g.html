filming a what I eat in a day video so
I'll show you everything I'm eating
throughout the day and I'll put any
recipes down below or I'll link to any
cookbooks I'm using I wasn't planning on
filming this video but we've actually
been quite organized this week with our
meal planning and food shopping so
hopefully I'm going to eat some good
stuff today first thing I always do is
make a cup of tea I just have English
breakfast tea with skimmed milk I like
to really squeeze out the tea bag so the
actual tea is really strong but then I
put in quite a lot of milk
that's just how I like my tea and for
breakfast I'm sitting here eating it now
so I'll talk you through what I made
basically porridge oats and I like to
make my porridge with water I just
always have growing up so I don't feel
the need to use anything kind of
creamier because I quite like it with
water so one part porridge two parts
water and then I just keep mixing that
load so it gets really creamy in the
saucepan and then I've also cut up an
apple and kind of put that on the side
sometimes I'll add raspberries or
blackberries but I only have apples in
flat today and I really like the crunch
that Apple gives as well I'm a big Apple
fan
so once the porridge is done I put that
in a bowl along with a handful of
granola this is the By Owner hazelnut
granola that I really like I'm then
going to add in that Apple cubes and a
sprinkle of omega seeds as well which
again adds a nice crunch and then I also
like sponsor maple syrup on top I'm a
big bank of syrup fan so that is what
I'm having for breakfast right now
having it with my tea and I'm watching
some YouTube videos and then I'm gonna
get on with some work and I'll show you
guys what I'm gonna have for lunch now
eleven o'clock and I need to rush out at
12:30 for an appointment so I'm gonna
pre make lunch now so I can quick
quickly have some before I head out at
12:30 for always the timing stone works
I'm gonna make a quick gazpacho soup I
didn't wake up that early this morning
so I'm still pretty full from breakfast
so I don't need a big lunch that'll do
me
until my afternoon snack was it bear in
mind I work from home so I haven't
really done much I haven't like left the
flat yet today so I don't need like big
meals the recipe for the X Factor suit
is from the Amelia Freya book is this
one and I really like this book there's
loads of recipes I think a great so the
first thing I did was cut up the red
pepper cucumber and tomatoes I actually
forgot celery but I would normally put
in half a stick of celery into this as
well I'm leaving a bit of a peppery hue
comes inside just to garnish
at the end I'm basically going to add
all of the ingredients into my Vitamix
so into the soup is red pepper cucumber
tomatoes spring onion garlic basil
sherry vinegar Tabasco salt and pepper
so it's really easy because everything
just gets chopped up and then you throw
it into a food processor and leave it in
the fridge for a couple of hours
so it's really really quick and easy to
make a really good one for lunch you
haven't got much time so I've just made
the soup in my Vitamix and then I've
just put it in the fridge I'm going to
let it chill there for an hour or so and
then have something for a cut out the
soup is really delicious it said to put
half a clove of garlic in and I put a
whole one in and it's very garlicky but
I love garlicky foods so really I'm
gonna have some minutes and then I'm
gonna head to my appointment I
absolutely stink now though so I'm going
to have some gum I'm just meeting my mom
in Planet organic wanna waiting for her
I haven't any mommy beans and carrots
and celery
I'm just that Jojo and honey's house
plain you know and Jojo gave me this so
just to keep this video honest I'm going
to eat it I'm back home I've been doing
some work and I ate my lunch pretty
early like 11:30 and I didn't have much
so I'm gonna have a bit more soup now
and I picked up this olive bread from
Waitrose when I was out so I'm gonna dip
that in and it should be yummy okay it's
dinner time now and I was actually gonna
make the aubergine stew from Madeline
Shaw's book I think it's on the second
book of hers and I really recommend it
it's so so yummy it's like aubergine and
tomatoes and I have it with couscous but
rich is just called and said that he is
staying out at a work event so I think
I'll save that for another night when
we're both eating and I actually fancy
something a little bit more comforting
so I've just kind of had a rummage
around the fridge and I'm gonna make
myself some spaghetti so nothing fancy
I'm going to cut up the onion and the
garlic and add them into the sauce spoon
until you can smell the yummy garlic and
then I'm gonna add in some courgette and
aubergine and I'm gonna let that cook
away for a little bit
and then I'm actually adding a tin of
chopped tomatoes and seasoning it with
salt and pepper and that's pretty much
it I'm gonna serve that with spelt
spaghetti I really love spelt spaghetti
I find that it's quicker to cook it
doesn't make me feel as bloated and I
just enjoy the taste and the texture way
more I get the by owner white spelt
spaghetti so that is what I'm going to
be making for dinner and I'm very
excited to dig in this is literally the
most fun fancy pastor ever but it's just
really yummy and it's not that bad for
you really so tonight's dinner was gonna
be something a bit fancy but this time
having in the end and I'm very happy
about it I'm going to sit and watch TV
now and eat my pasta I also put a little
bit of parmesan on the top as well I'm
watching the bake-off and it's making me
crave something sweet so I'm going to
have one of these the brand is called
panda and they're basically natural
raspberry liquorice and I really like
them because they're you know there's no
narcy's in there you can see no
preservatives they're vegetarian vegan
and all that they don't taste too sweet
either I really like them so I'm going
to snack on one of these I'm now doing
some editing on the sofa and I've made
myself a nice cup of tea
English breakfast with skimmed milk
again so I'm going to end this video
here hope you guys like seeing what I
ate today every day is different
pretty much so this is just one example
of one of my days but let me know if you
like these kind of videos and I'll see
you guys in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
