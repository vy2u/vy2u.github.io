doing a sit-down popper video like this
with lights and everything because I
haven't done it in such a long time but
I've been thinking about doing this
video for a little while and I put it on
Instagram stories the other day and
pretty much all of you said yes please
do it so I'm going to be showing you
today what I got for my birthday and
I've never done a video like this in my
eight years of blogging or YouTube or
whatever normally I find them a little
bit cringe and there's just something
about them that doesn't sit right with
me which is why I don't do them every
year and normally I get pajamas and
socks and not even much like a little
book or something I really don't take
birthdays that seriously me and my
friends we don't kind of go all out
me and Richard never like spoilt each
other with presents we like so just save
our money for other things but I think
this year because it was my 30th
birthday a lot of my friends and family
wants to get me some really special
gifts and a lot of them asked me what I
wanted because they wanted to make sure
I got I got something I wanted so I got
some really amazing gifts and I thought
I would do this video one because it
might be good gift inspiration for those
of you who still haven't got Christmas
presents and two because I mentioned it
to all my friends and they're like oh
yeah please show I got you because I'm
so proud of it I think it's nice for
them as well for me to like show off my
gifts anyway you guys know I'm not
bragging so let me start with rich he
got me this really gorgeous ring from a
Brian called Maria black we saw it when
we were in Liberty it's a really nice
that mid range brand it's not crazy
crazy expensive and it's not High Street
it's like somewhere in between and I
thought that was really nice and a
little bit kind of cool and different
and I knew he was giving me that but as
an extra surprise he got me these
trainers which I've wanted since I saw
them they are incredible they're the
black vans but in leather which is so
perfect because I love wearing my vans
like every day but they've got so grubby
and this is having them in a black
leather makes them like a little bit
more smarter I wanted to get the black
fans anyway but when I saw them that
they came and leather I was like this is
perfect
they're kind of a bit smarter I feel
like they're they'll be more durable
especially in the rain I absolutely love
these I haven't worn them yet they're so
clean it's ridiculous I can't wait to
wear them my friend Deb's got me the
most gorgeous necklace to be fair I had
seen this in Suzanne and I told rich I
liked it Richard basically to keep him
nope everything I liked so I didn't know
who was gonna get me what but she got me
this necklace it's a really really long
gold chain and at the bottom it's got
little black beads and I don't know it's
really hard to describe it but I like
this necklace because there's so many
different ways to wear it
you can just wrap it round like this and
wear it like that you can kind of tie it
in a knot and wear it like that I just
thought it would be really nice to wear
especially with like an open shirt very
versatile and it comes in a few
different colors as well but I wanted
the one black so it goes with everything
and it's so pretty
I absolutely love it that was from Deb's
my friends SJ Rob Chairman Ben all
clumped together to get me a present
they got me like a jokey one and a
serious wire but they got me a little
puzzle because they know I love puzzles
this is a 500 piece one so I feel like
it's actually doable although it's like
a Christmas scene and it looks really
difficult but definitely gonna give that
a go and then they also got me this
mirror which I really really wanted from
Cox and Cox I absolutely love Cox and
Cox it's such a great website and this
is a which says on the website
full-length mirror so they got me this
mirror and I absolutely love it but
unfortunately when I took it out of the
box it's it's really not full-length
it's like half the size of my IKEA
full-length mirror which I currently
have is like an in-between one and so
when I stand in it because I normally
use mirrors to show you guys what I'm
wearing like your blogs and stuff and
when I stand in front of it is that she
cut off to there I don't know why I
could probably prop it up on something
but I feel like they spent so much money
that I want to get something perfect so
I think we're sending that back and then
looking for another full-length mirror
so if you guys know of any nice ones
that are similar please let me know but
such a generous and absolutely lovely
gift and yeah I'm really excited to find
the perfect mirror on the mirror theme
my sister Jojo got me a mirror for my
dressing-table I've currently got an
IKEA dressing table I probably will one
day get
so on but for now it's absolutely fine
to go on there I really wanted to mirror
it because the one I've got from Oliver
bonus is it's just too small I feel like
I have to get really close to do my
makeup so this is a really nice large
mirror where was this from I think this
might be from Cox and Cox as well it's
brass around the edges and then you can
see it's got this like triangular glass
bit and then I don't want to turn it and
blind you guys but it's just a huge huge
mirror there I am so it's great because
I can see when I'm doing a makeup and
hair and it looked really nice on my
dressing table as well I really love
that Anna got me the most ridiculous
gift ever
I mean so so generous and so so
thoughtful I was just like oh I was been
overwhelmed she gave it to me yeah I
just can't believe it she really liked
forward-thinking as well and just too
much I was like no I really you can't
give this to me she got me from one of
our favorite brands lingua franca lingua
franca I think it's pronounced she does
amazing cashmere jumpers with really
cool like sayings on it embroidered on
and I love them as they are I didn't
even realize that she does personalize
ones I don't know how Anna figured that
out genius so she got me a gorgeous gray
cashmere jumper perfect color choice and
then on the front embroidered is new kid
in town which is one of my favorite
equal songs and it's tattooed on my
wrist and I just think that's so
thoughtful these are really not cheap
it's a cashmere jumper it's personalized
I love the color combination she just
knows me so well I know she was so
excited to give this to me and it's
seriously one of the best presents I've
ever got so love it I'm actually like a
bit scared to wear it somebody what if I
have to wash it I really don't want an
embroidered bit to get ruined but I do
love it this gift that she came this
morning it was perfect timing which is
sister got me from ASOS some pajamas and
I love getting pajamas as a present I
can never have too many pajamas these
are grey and they've got white lips all
over them so it's a top and it's bottoms
and I'm going to put those on tonight I
can't wait very soft
cuddly oh I forgot to show you honey my
niece didn't meet the story that's me
and that's her and I'm guessing those
watermelons and I mean I think that
looks like a showering fruit I'm
obsessed of showering for you but I
think that'd be weird if she knew that
so maybe they're like oranges or
something not really sure but very cute
and we're gonna put this in my photo
album I took loads of photos over my
birthday so we're gonna print them off
put them in an album and put this into
because I think she'll find it funny
when she's older from my sister Carly
and her husband Ben
they got me an Amazon echo an Amazon
echo dot I don't know it's the one
that's just the little circular thing
because we've already got a sauna
speaker downstairs so we can just link
it to that and I really really wanted
one of these if you saw my Christmas
gift guide video I mentioned tell me and
Richard desperate for one whenever I'm
in the kitchen or just downstairs in
general I love to have music on so it's
so easy now because we could just say
I've whispered because I don't want it
to come on and then we can just be like
play Stevie Wonder and it plays Stevie
Wonder in the speakers and it's amazing
it's do loads of other things by love it
and ASA their son who is six that would
be hilarious to get me this he saw it
when they were in Urban Outfitters and
literally he was so excited to give me
this mug he was cracking up laughing his
head off and I've had like little boys
just think boobs are so hilarious but
joke's on him because I love this mug
and I really wanted to get it anyway I
already had my eyes on it and I just
think it's so cool I really like it it's
put on my desk so even though he just
got it because he thought it was really
silly and hilarious I genuinely think
this is one of my favorite gifts my mom
wanted to get me something for the house
and so took a little while to figure out
what I wanted and in the end she's
ordered me a really gorgeous blush pink
velvet pouf from me calm it's not gonna
be ready until February so I can I
should show you but I'll pop a picture
up on the screen it's so so gorgeous
I absolutely love it only problem is
it's doing that we have got a velvet
loveseat coming which is in the core
just like Keeley kind of bluey green
that's coming I don't know sometime in
the new year and I'm not sure if the
pink is gonna go but my thinking is I'll
put the pink pouf on the other side of
the living room
my leg gray little chair and if it still
doesn't go that I can always use the
poof like upstairs at my bedroom to sit
on when I do my makeup but I'm sure we
can make it work I absolutely love it
and I'm so excited for it to come but as
with my mom and she's ridiculous she
said she didn't want to have like
nothing to give me on my birthday so she
got me she may not like a cute box of
all these different things that she
thought I would like which is very sweet
one of them is from therapy a brand new
photo really love I've already figured
it out yet but it's basically like an an
illuminate ritual oil I need to look at
this properly but some kind of like oil
thingies on your face she also got me a
couple of books the little book of life
hacks how to make your life happier
healthier and more beautiful don't watch
try my hints at but it's a really really
nice book it's got so many like
beautiful illustrations in it Wow
I literally feel like I haven't looked
at it yet properly I need to go through
and look at every single page of little
gorgeous and then she also got me the
Lisa routine my relationship with food
recipe books 100 recipes in and my mom
makes the most incredible salads or
whenever I ask her like where to get the
recipe for this it's always from this
book there was so many great recipes in
here so I'm very excited for that and
she also got me some Primark PJ's these
are just black with white polka dots and
they're very soft so do I always get PJs
for presents these are also on my
favorite favorite gifts this is from
Rich's mum and dad I liked a lot of
candles at home and I always find myself
having to trim the wick with my scissors
and end up ruining the candle and the
cameras I have a quite expensive so I
want to look after them I think they
deserve her so she got me a wick trimmer
so they're like scissors but they're
specially designed to cut the wick on a
candle so it goes kind of way down so
you don't have to like get it into an
awkward position so that shows the wick
you should always trim the wick before
nice in your candle because if you ever
see your candle like really flickering
and going black around the edges that's
because you haven't trimmed the wick
first and then this is a candle snuffer
which puts out the candle you can
definitely blow the flame out but
sometimes I find that it blows the wax
as well and you end up with kind of
black bits from the wick in the candle
Oh so this one you just put it over and
it kind of gets rid of the flame because
of
there's no oxygen going to the flame and
because it moves you can do it from any
angle you can do it directly down or you
can do it like that it's also really
hard to find these in gold
the ones from tip seek a silver and I
just much of our gold so these are from
we are truther which is a website I
really really love so there's a really
cool I just now need to find a gold kind
of long lighter because I always run out
of matches so I think it's better to
just get a lighter and then the final
gift is from Hannah my friend and such a
creative and thoughtful gift she got me
a six-month subscription to bloom and
wild so every month I think is on a
Tuesday
a bouquet of flowers will be delivered
to my home and I just have so no
specialties now we've got our new home
and she knows I love flowers and might
actually been thinking about signing up
something like that for a while because
I always like to have fresh flowers in
the house it looks nice makes me feel
good and it's great for a photo prop as
well so now to know that I've always got
her flowers on the go it's just such a
nice gift I'm just really like made me
think well I'm definitely gonna give
that as a gift to someone else because I
think that is a really good one so I
think that is everything I got some
really really lovely thoughtful special
gifts this year I had such a nice time
for my 30th if you guys didn't see my
vlog which was up last week I will link
it up here now is such a fun time in
Norfolk with my friends I don't really
celebrate birthdays that much and I
haven't since I was a kid so it was
really nice to do it and it was
definitely one of my best birthdays yeah
now I'm just excited for Christmas
and I can't wait to eat everything I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
and I'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
