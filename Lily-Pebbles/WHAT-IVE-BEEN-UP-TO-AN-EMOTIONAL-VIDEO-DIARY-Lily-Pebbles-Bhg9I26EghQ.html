the day I announce my book I announce
tit a few hours ago and I'm just buzzing
from the response ten minutes until my
announcement I am like I feel like I'm
starting school today I'm terrified feel
sick oh my god I just tweeted my like
it's coming into a minute tweet I'm
really panicking it's nineteen twenty
nine is nine twenty nine I'm almost nine
thirty
it's nine thirty oh my god oh my god oh
my god is loads of tweets coming in on
amazing response I've just thought I'd
read and comment it's now almost ten
thank you so much I'm not gonna go on
for too long because this video is so
long but basically I have been blogging
the whole experience I thought you know
I'm always really honest with you guys
and I thought that you would find it
really interesting to know Mike from my
experience the process of writing a book
from beginning to well now by this point
I have finished writing the book but I
haven't got like the printed version or
anything like that so I vlog the whole
experience I thought you guys would like
to watch this and that's what this video
is gonna be so the next clip you're
gonna see is me back a long time ago and
it's a bit confusing because I'm talking
about a different book but you will see
why so that's what this video is gonna
be and I just wanted to say thank you so
much for your incredible response and
support on my launch last week it will
be for you guys
thank you to anyone who's pre-ordered
the book I know I don't usually
pre-order books I always think when
someone announces a book I'm like I'm
just gonna get it when it comes out but
I didn't realize until doing this the
reason why people always want to
pre-order because it actually really
helps for many reasons it kind of helps
towards the first week when the book
comes out it helps in terms of where the
book charts
it also helps push the book and make it
kind of recommend it to more people on
places like Amazon and Smiths and
waterstones
when you pre-order it tends to arrive on
the day of release so rather than
ordering it when it comes out and having
to wait a week so if you'd like to
pre-order the book that would massively
help me I'm gonna put links below to WH
Smith have some signed copies if they're
still available that's just UK only
we'll ship internationally and I'm not
sure about water as it might be UK only
but Amazon with definition
internationally so I'll put those links
and there's the description box if you'd
like to order your copy of the f-word
it's so weird to be talking about it but
this video is a diary of my whole
process it's an emotional roller coaster
just warn you and from now on I can just
blog normally when I'm doing book
related stuff which is a massive relief
for me thank you for all your support I
really really appreciate it
and the next clip is me a long time ago
hi everyone this is a little blast from
the past because today it's actually the
19th of July 2017 I think by now you
guys should have heard about my new book
I've announced a book which right now
really feels like quite a crazy thought
because I haven't even started writing
the book I wanted to kind of try and
vlog the whole process if I can and talk
to you guys as much as I can about what
it's like to write a book from like my
perspective so I really just now decided
to start this vlog but the whole journey
of writing a book started quite a while
ago for me maybe about a year ago
initially I had this idea it was an idea
that I just wanted it to be a thing and
I didn't really care if I did it or
someone else did it I just really wanted
to kind of like read it as a as a viewer
the idea at the time was to interview a
range of different women in all
different types of careers
I really felt quite passionate about
there being something out there for
young people who don't know about all
the different jobs there are available
who feel a bit restricted at school like
I did and I thought we really great to
have a book that was along those lines
it's a lot more detailed but I won't get
into that now so I actually worked for
how many remembered all the day so maybe
about six months on a proposal the whole
book writing things very different
depending on who you are some people
will spend four years writing a book
they'll have a finished book and then
they'll take it to a publisher to see if
they can get it published I'm very aware
that I'm in such a lucky position
because of you guys because I have my
business and a following it doesn't
exactly work that way for me and I
definitely have had times of guilt don't
get me wrong I have moments of guilt all
the time to thinking like I'm so lucky I
know I actually know people friends of
mine who have been writing books for
years who might
not even get it published so I'm well
aware of how lucky I am but I also did
work really hard for like seven years to
build up kind of my following and my
branding and stuff online so yeah I am
lucky so it worked a little bit
different for me I worked on a proposal
a proposal is kind of where you write
like an intro and a snippet of what the
book would be like and you come out some
chapter ideas and then I went along with
ABI who is a literary agent that works
with lead my management we went to all
the different publishers and we took my
idea I think by that point kind of six
months on you know I've interviewed
about three or four women I'd come up
with some different like profile ideas
and I was definitely feeling a little
bit doubtful I still really felt
passionate about the idea but I just
didn't feel like I was the right person
to do that I didn't feel like I'd had
maybe an enough career experience or I
just had all these different doubts and
I found it quite difficult to write
about the topic still laughs the idea it
just wasn't sure it was like me who
should be doing it and I think when we
went to the publishers that kind of came
across as well there was a lot there's
lots of there were lots of complicated
chats on like whether this could be like
a full-color book or a black-and-white
book and the behind-the-scenes stuff in
the book industry is mad I had no idea
how complicated it was I think it was
the third person that we'd seen where I
was discussing the book idea and she was
quite into it we were talking about
different ways it could be done but then
she said I've got a bit of a rogue idea
this is a book that I just think really
needs to be done I haven't found the
right person to kind of get behind it
let me know what you think and she
actually pitched the idea to me for my
book she said I think it would be great
if there was a book about female
friendships and it was a bit of a light
bulb moment I was a bit like oh my god
why hadn't I thought of that and
immediately we all lunch there was like
four of us in this meeting we all
launched into like an hour brainstorm of
all the different things I'd want to
talk about I suddenly you could see I
felt so passionate about topic I was
like that is one thing I feel like I am
an expert in you guys know me so well
for having like all my friends and my
videos and stuff and I just feel like
there's so much I want to talk about I
got so excited about the idea I went
home I felt like massive guilt over the
fact that I hadn't come up with the idea
I was like oh my god but this isn't my
idea looked into it more realized that
is so common in a
quad for an idea to be pitched to the
author and then they kind of run with it
so I felt better about that and I just
got really excited about writing like
topic ideas chapter ideas and yeah you
could just see I was so passionate about
it so we left the other idea at the side
which was sad because I've worked on it
for so long but I've seen other similar
books come out since so I feel better
about that and it's always content you
know with our podcast I feel like I've
done a similar thing with that I'm still
very very interested in women careers
and kind of opening up the eyes of
younger people to what jobs out there
but I really really loved the idea for
this female friendship book so I then
went and spent actually I had to do it
pretty quickly I probably spent about a
month and a half working on a brand new
proposal so that other proposal I worked
so I had to kind of put it in the bin
and start a brand new one so I wrote an
intro and then I wrote topics like all
the different topics and chapters I'd
want to do so by this point there was no
input from that editor who'd given me
the idea she literally had just said a
book about female friendships and I kind
of went with it
and wrote all that things I'd want to
talk about and I wrote like a paragraph
each chapter to say in this chapter I'm
gonna talk about this and then also in
the proposal you like write a little bit
of a bio about yourself and stuff and
then it's up to her so this is Brian II
from Hodder she has been taken to her
bosses and kind of see what they think
and financially work out if it's kind of
doable it took a little while but then
it came back and I got a book deal I got
a book offer which was just mad it all
happened so quickly towards the end
after talking about it for so long then
I'm kind of here that was like a few
months ago I've got a book deal I have
three months to write a book you're
probably watching this video in November
which I had to hand in this book on like
the first of November and then I think
that's when we're announcing it and it's
crazy I it's a bit of an emotional
roller coaster I'm I go through moments
of having like massive self-doubt
thinking like Who am I to think that I
can write a book you know I make videos
am i even a good writer and then I like
rights and stuff and be like this is so
boring this is like I'm just writing a
dictionary or something in the knife
moments normally when I'm not talking to
my friends about it where I'm like oh my
god I'm so passionate about this topic
and all like I'll read
my old diaries and be like oh my god I
love this is so fitting for my
personality I've always cared so much
about this topic I think it's just
because I'm at the beginning of the
process it's really hard to start with
like a blank page so I don't really know
how the whole process is going to go
I've done this little trick behind me on
the wall ride like stuck post-it notes
on the wall with like lots of different
ideas so I can refer to every now and
again I'm trying to find like an office
space that I can work from because I
find it's so hard to concentrate on like
writing when I'm at home
I pretty much have to send like 10,000
words a week to my editor I just don't
know how I'm gonna write 10,000 words a
week but I just have to get started and
see where it goes and hope that it turns
into something great so I'll try and
blog this process and check in every now
and again but at the moment I'm right in
the beginning I've written 2,000 words I
have no idea if it's good or not but I
really love what this book is about it's
gonna be hopefully a really positive
book I've got so many stories to share
and so many topics I think a lot of you
will relate to I'm excited by the fact
that it's quite different I think for
like a youtuber book but that also
terrifies me because I feel like you
guys on YouTube are used to me doing
like different things but it's quite
different I think anyway let's see where
it goes
I hope that I was allowed to share all
of those things I haven't even asked if
I but tomorrow actually tomorrow morning
we've got our first meeting about the
cover and the title which again blows my
mind because I've hardly started writing
the thing and we're already talking
about covers and titles but everything
moved so fast you kind of have to I
don't think we're gonna come up with a
cough I know title maybe just a holding
title but I'm gonna kind of tell them
what covers I like and what covers I
don't like yeah I think coming up the
title is gonna be really really hard cuz
I'm very fussy when it comes to things
like that so we will see I'm excited and
nervous for that meeting everything I'm
doing with this whole book is excited
and nervous and I find it quite hard
that I haven't been able to tell you
guys what I'm doing so I think for like
my videos haven't been great recently
and I can't really tell you why but I
hope that you understand now right
Thursday the 20th of July today
I'm a very quiet Waterstones in
Piccadilly Circus today I'm meeting
George oh he's my manager
Abbey who is my literary agent at gleam
and Briony who's my editor at Potter and
I think the aim of the meeting today is
to look around at different book covers
talk about things I like and don't like
maybe talk a little bit about the title
for the book as I said in the last clip
I think this is kind of crazy right at
the beginning of writing the book so it
all feels very early days to see to see
about title and covers but it's quite a
quick turnaround so we need to start
like getting some ideas in place so it's
nice to be in such an amazing bookshop
water sensitivity is huge and beautiful
and only 9:30 in the morning so it's
really quiet just got myself a little
cup of tea at the cafe and waited
everyone else to turn up and I'm excited
I love this part I love like the
creativity sort of meetings and we've
never really done anything like this yet
so really looking forward to it so the
main scene this morning when really well
we were in waterstones Piccadilly we sat
down and had a little chat and a
catch-up and then we were talking about
covers and Briony my editor said don't
worry it's gonna be really chilled are
gonna walk around the store and just
talk about things you like and don't
like and I actually did a little bit of
homework she was very impressed I was
impressed myself because I never
actually did homework when I was meant
to do homework but I printed out a
couple of pages on things that caught my
eye and I liked and didn't like it
actually it was quite helpful because
once I created everything on a page
there was a clear theme on a sort of
typography and photos and stuff that I
liked so I think even from that she got
quite a clear idea of what I like and
don't like and then we walked around the
store and we just picked up a few books
here and there and said like oh I don't
like it when the text is like a little
bit 3d she was like that's good to know
and I said I really like it when there's
like a block of color around the edge or
different like things really it was also
quite helpful in terms of thinking of a
name and a title and things like that
really um I think for now we're gonna
call it the f-word my plan for Friday is
to come up with like a skeleton of the
book so put an order like the chapter
ideas I have so I have more of a
skeleton to work from because at the
moment I'm just like going on nothing
so it'll be quite good when I have like
chapter I'd is to work towards and then
I will update you guys next time
something happens but for now I just
need to get writing really it is the
18th of August and it's Friday night and
I'm sitting at my desk waiting so I
thought it was about time I gave you
guys a bit of an update because it's
been a little while I think I can't even
remember now what I've said and what I
haven't said but by now I basically
handed in my first 10,000 words I think
I told you guys that we're gonna try and
do it like in 10000 batches because
that's meant to be less intimidating
although 10,000 words still feels like a
lot so the first 10,000 I sent to
Abbey's military agent and I wasn't
really sure what the feedback process
like would be whether she would like
rewrite things or just like write little
notes I didn't really know what to
expect so I sent her well I think was
8000 I couldn't quite get to ten I was
just like this is so hard like without
any feedback and stuff sent her that and
basically how it works she kind of would
read it and then put this is a really
interesting point why don't you
elaborate on this here and just give me
like little bits of encouragement or be
like this section is really nice I think
it's better if you put it after this
section so that was really fun it's
really interesting having like my first
batch of feedback and now I'm working on
the second 10,000 words it's weird
because I just have no idea like I had
no idea how fast or slow I would be at
writing I've obviously never done
anything this big before by myself and I
probably am a little bit on the slow
side sometimes I feel like I'll sit here
and write loads and then it would just
be like 400 words and I'm like how does
that even make sense I'm now on almost
3,000 so I need to get this up to 10,000
but I also want to make sure that what
I'm writing is good obviously I've put
loads of post-it notes on my wall to
like guide me on different chapters and
different ideas that I think of I'm
trying to chat to friends and people
whenever I can and some days I'll write
better than other days I've definitely
worked better in the evening which is
why I'm sitting here on a Friday night
and I have moments of panic where I feel
like I'm not really good enough and now
I have moments thinking oh my god I love
this idea I can't wait to share it with
everyone so it's a bit of an emotional
roller coaster but I'm gonna keep going
with it and I still feel like there's so
much to say
is good I think we're kind of working on
doing half the amount like half the book
before we send it to the editor who I
don't really know what happened then but
that's kind of what I'm working towards
now trying to not think too far ahead
because I get really intimidated so I'm
just doing it like a section at a time I
think that's all for my update today
hi everyone today is actually the 10th
of October and I have an updated you for
over a month I am very very sorry about
that but so much has changed since I
last updated you on the book September
was probably my busiest month that I've
ever had in my whole career I don't know
why but sometimes everything just
happens at the same time and I had a lot
of jobs and a lot of different things
going on and it was a crazy crazy month
so throughout that month I was
continuing my writing and trying to keep
up with these deadlines I had I'm gonna
be honest I had like a mini breakdown
and it did get to the point where I was
kind of staring at the screen not able
to write anything and just kind of
breaking down into tears in front of
people I was in the gleam office with
Tanya burr and just cried and I was not
in a good place
and I think you guys also sense that
online I actually decided to take a
little bit of an internet break this
month in October for many reasons and
I'm sure by now you would have seen a
video of me explaining why but there's a
lot going on right now and I was just so
behind with this book and I really
really want to do it and I want to do it
well and I want to make it a priority
and when I'm uploading regularly and
doing videos and Instagram and Twitter
it kind of takes over and it's it's hard
to do a bit of that so I just wanted to
see what it's like to do none of that
and just focus on the book just for this
month a month is quite a long time in
the internet world but really it's not
that long in terms of like deadlines so
it's the 10th I've done had over a week
of like no internet and just writing and
my speed of writing has definitely
improved I had a meeting yesterday with
Brian II my editor is only the second
time that I've had a meeting with her
really
and it was so successful as she was
she'd read like the first 20,000 words
I've written and she was so happy with
it and really impressed which was like a
real confidence boost for me because up
until that point I just had no idea if I
was doing anything right I know there's
no like right or wrong because it's my
book but as I've said before I've never
done this before so I like work really
well when I get a bit of encouragement
so that was really good and then I've
like smashed out another 10,000 words
and sent off today
so I've still got a long way to go I'm
kind of halfway there and the deadline
is looming my deadline is November sick
I have no idea if I'm gonna reach that
but we're gonna deal with that problem
when we get to it for now I'm just gonna
spend this entire month focusing on
writing and just trying my hardest to
hit that deadline the writing process
has been so interesting there's been
moments where I'm just like oh I just
don't know what to write or some days
where I just I feel like I haven't got
it in me and then other days I'll just
be flying and I'll love it and I'll be
so passionate about writing about that
specific topic but I think it comes
across in my writing as well as if so at
some point I'm gonna kind of go back
through I've written and just add to
that I'm so used to like short for media
that's what it's called you know like
blog posts and tweets and Instagram
captions that are quite short I did a
dissertation at uni but that's the last
time I've written something this long so
it's just getting used to the habit of
kind of elaborating really by feeling
really positive about it now and I'm as
you can hear I'm like getting over a
cold I've been ill for weeks I need to
start thinking about how I'm going to
announce this book and tell you guys I
really don't want to just kind of put on
Instagram or Twitter I want to do
something cool because I think it
deserves it so that's something I'm
trying to start thinking about like the
logistics of planning a video like that
I'm definitely gonna get someone to help
me because I have to write I'm quite
nervous for November when everything
else will start up again video social
media and everything else because in
September I did not do well at trying to
do everything but I'm just gonna focus
on this month for now in terms of the
title we're still going with the f-word
and I'm definitely going to love it
didn't ever not love it but I just
wanted to make sure that we had options
and feelings I can't think of anything
else and I think it kind of works it
works in like a female friendship way
but also it's like a bit like the f
words I like how friendships a bit of a
taboo subject that we don't talk about
enough the more people I keep like
telling my friends about it to see their
reactions so that's what I'm doing in
the moment at the moment I'm like
seeding it out getting like a feel for
people's reactions to it the hardest
thing about any project is naming it
it's the worst
so yeah I'm feeling good enjoying my
writing and just once an update you guys
sorry there were no updates in September
but I was an actual mess of a person
there was so much traveling in September
as well oh my god never again hi
everyone today is the 17th of October
I'm halfway through my month of not
uploading anything to the internet and
yeah I thank you all for being very
patient you're sending me some nice
messages but my head it feels so clear
I'm so glad I've done it because I
definitely feel like I'm in a better
like writing space at the moment I'm
still working through all the edits my
editor briny has given me but I'm
actually going today to meet her so we
can brainstorm some new topics kind of
start putting things in a better order
and I just got lots of questions and
stuff for her as well this week is felt
very much like a therapy session I can
didn't realize how much detail I'd have
to go into I mean that seems obvious but
it's just not something you think about
before and I guess I can't really talk
about my experiences without really
talking in detail about the experience
itself which means that I'm talking
about my friends in quite a lot of
detail so I'm having to first of all
check that they're happy with me to
share these stories and then ask them
loads of questions about it so say a
friend went through like a really hard
time I've been interviewing that friend
and talking about borrow which it's
quite like mentally exhausting to like
hear people's problems and issues and
then put it into my own words and it's
definitely quite like mentally tiring
which I didn't expect the tool in this
process but I'm really enjoying it right
now I'm enjoying like going in and
adding more detail rather than just like
working from a blank space so I'm going
to meet Briony today we've got like a
two-hour meeting gonna do lots of
brainstorming and I've got questions and
stuff for her and
yeah I'm just gonna get on with it for
the rest of the week and next week today
is 25th of October so I'm near the end
of my month of no internet so I'm very
out of practice when it comes to
vlogging but I wanted to bring you guys
along today because I'm actually leaving
my flat for the first time in a while I
have a meeting at Hodder my editor I'm
gonna meet briney first and we're gonna
go through some notes because feedback
so far as mainly just being like
elaborate here elaborate here and a
couple of them I just feel a bit stuck
and I'm not really sure how to elaborate
so we're gonna meet up and do a little
brainstorm and then I've got a meeting
with the marketing team a hardier I
haven't met anyone from the marketing
team I'm very nervous because I feel
like a bit of a control freak when it
comes to marketing it's kind of what I
love and I specialize in and when it
comes to like reaching out to bloggers
and asking people to read my book I feel
like I'm gonna have a lot to say about
it and I don't know if it's in this
meeting but we might be looking at some
like first sketches of the cover which
I'm also terrified for I'm excited but I
kind of wish I knew exactly what I
wanted because then I feel like it would
be easier but I just know what I don't
like and I'm not sure I do like I gave
them like a whole mood board of colors
and other book covers I like but we're
gonna have to just see what they come up
with and how we can kind of make it work
so we all like it
so I'm gonna head to embankment now by
the Thames that's where Hodder are based
and yeah writing is going well and
really in the flow of things I'm really
enjoying it I feel like it's really good
but it's also just also scary I feel
scared every day
it's actually the next day now sorry I
forgot to vlog when I got home from the
meeting but it was really good I met up
with Brian in my editor and we talked
through any questions I had we also
tried to come up like a strap line for
the book which is so hard I'm really bad
at like catchy things like that
I've told Anna to get her thinking cap
on because she's so good and then we had
a meeting with PR and marketing teams
they were all really really lovely and
there's so much more to it than I
thought like I was thinking about just
kind of reaching out to press and
journalists and bloggers and stuff but
they've obviously got to do PR for
retailers and booksellers and stuff as
well so it's like really complicated but
I had some ideas I put to them and they
kind of put some ideas to me and we just
started talking about it but they
haven't read the book yet so I feel like
once they do they'll understand that
even more I'll have a really twitchy eye
and that means I'm tired hey I'll get
back to you soon with another update
today the 27th of October it's a Friday
and I started to look at the footage
from this video yesterday for the first
time since I started and I realized
there were a few gaps along the way and
especially from September to the end of
October I didn't really explain kind of
how I got out of my writing rut you know
it's not really sure if I even remember
but I am in such a good place now and I
feel like I didn't mention that in the
video that um I kind of was at 20,000
words and then before I knew it I was
like 45,000 and that second twenty
thirty thousand was so much easier to
write I really got into the flow of
things and just really started to enjoy
it which is so good and now I'm on
55,000 and I'm kind of coming to the end
I'm finishing up like the edits that
Brian II my editor gave me and starting
to think about an outro which i think is
gonna be really hard because the intro
was really difficult I needed a B my
literary agent she helped me quite a lot
with the intro so I feel like I might
need help with the outro because I feel
like those are the two places like I
feel like trying to sum up this whole
book in an outro is gonna be quite hard
I really I really actually enjoyed the
past come a few weeks I've definitely
been in swing of things which is great
so yesterday I got sent the first ideas
for the cover and you guys saw earlier
in the video that we went to water
stones together to look at different
covers and I send them like a mood board
of things that I like so they have like
an in-house
designer and basically they sent me an
email with four different options and I
don't really know I didn't know what to
expect I didn't know if it was gonna be
exactly what I wanted or not at all I
wanted I guess it was somewhere in
between there were four options and I
kind of went through and said what I
liked and what I didn't like there were
some that had like polaroid pictures on
them which I wasn't really a fan of that
and then so much I didn't like the phone
some of them I thought like didn't look
like what the book was about it's
actually really hard because friendship
a lot of things that associated the
friendship are quite young I didn't want
it to be childish because it's not a
childish book it's about modern grown-up
female friendships so it's weed hard to
think of things that remind me of my
female friendships so they serve a few
options I didn't love any of them there
was something some parts of them that I
liked but it actually really inspired me
to start thinking about what I really do
want for the the cover and I don't know
if I was meant to do this on I think I
meant to leave it to professionals but I
said the whole night kind of drawing my
own idea of how I see the cover looking
I kind of want to speed it up just
because I really want to have a cover to
show people in my announcement video I
think that's very unrealistic but I
don't know we'll see and that's all I've
got to update you on look how happy I am
I am a changed woman today is the 6th of
November and it's deadline day when we
originally set this date as my deadline
it felt kind of so far away and I
couldn't ever imagine being at the point
where I'd actually have a written book
that I could send to someone and that's
today and yeah I've finished it I've
written an ending and I've read through
it and I've changed things and I sent it
off to my editor this morning and she
replied she's like I'm so excited I
can't believe you got here well done
congratulations rich sent me balloons
look which sent me balloons so it really
feels like I've achieved something today
I've written a book and I've sent it in
it's madness I don't even really know
what happens from here on out I think my
editor has it for two weeks she's gonna
edit it like make sure there's no
repetition and maybe change the order of
things and then she's gonna send it back
to me to check and kind of add more and
change I've got it for two weeks
and then after that I don't know I
reckon like a copy writer will look at
it someone from legal to make sure like
I haven't done anything illegal in it I
don't even know but I can't believe I've
like reached the finish line it's
madness I've written a book what the
hell from having my like breakdown - now
feels like a blip like I don't even
remember what's happened it's crazy it's
crazy today is the 8th of December and I
met up with Jacob who is helping me film
my announcement video purely because I'm
not good enough to be in it and director
and do everything and I haven't really
got any time to actually do the video so
I got him on board I never really have
other people do my videos for me but I'm
really excited about it because it's
something different and special and we
sat together today and recorded a
voiceover because I basically written
out a little script that will make it
like a trailer video hopefully by now
you guys have would have seen it so
y'all know what I'm talking about but he
came over helped me record the
voice-over and then we planned out the
scenes that we need to film and we're
gonna be filming tomorrow and Saturday
and there may be a bit next week if we
need to and I'm really excited I don't
know how much of the process I'm gonna
show because this video is gonna be mega
long but oh my god it's starting to feel
real the fact that I actually have to
announce it and tell people about it
terrifying my heart is like beating like
crazy today is the 9th of November and
we're gonna be filming my announcement
video I'm really excited
okay I'm here with Anna there hello and
Jacobs they're setting up and we're
gonna be filming some shots they were
gonna film me and Anna on the sofa
pretending to film video which we
actually haven't done ours at my head
which we actually haven't done in ages
like there's like a proper video he's
gonna look at probably these guys are
now in on the secret I know you guys
know but right now they don't know I
know it's so cool that now you know that
we know that you know that's like the
friends so today is the 21st of November
I announced my book this Sunday I can't
believe that I'm so terrified I've
realised I really need to learn how to
like describe the book was I've been
keeping it to myself for so long and
like not really talking to anyone about
it I'm starting to talk to people about
it and realize that I really need to
like describe it well because I get a
bit like panicky when I have to talk
about it so I'm going to try practice
that this week before everyone knows
about it on Sunday but today I'm going
back to Hodor we've got
meeting for quite a few things we're
going to talk about the cover so I sent
back my suggestions I showed you guys
and then they sent back some more
changes and I really liked them but now
we're discussing how to make it how to
make the cover reflect what's inside
it's really hard actually I kind of knew
it would be hard but yeah it was really
hard so we're gonna have a half-an-hour
meeting about the cover and then I've
got a meeting just me and brining my
editor to go through her notes obviously
I handed in my book two weeks ago so
that's what we're doing today this is
karma lighthouse and it's building up
you spending a lot of time in the last
few months so today's meeting was really
successful I just got back from Rich's
birthday dinner we talked about
everything from which retailers want me
to sign some of the books to just kind
of talking about the timeline of what's
gonna happen from now until March I'm
gonna get my best friend Hannah to read
through it which I still would be really
nice one because I want her to check you
know if she thinks anything's missing I
don't know I just I really want to get
her approval
so I'm gonna send that to her to read
through and yeah I'm announcing this
Sunday I am terrified I'm so excited but
I'm really really terrified this is the
biggest thing I've ever announced ever
like podcast is probably the second
biggest and but I was doing that with
Anna so we kind of went through every
emotion together which this is like
pretty much feels like it's just me I'm
very scared very excited I can't really
figure out what my emotions are I can't
believe next week I'm gonna be able to
talk about it openly I feel like it's
been such a secret for so long I haven't
even hinted about it I feel like I'm
worried I'm gonna forget to talk about
it so I feel like I might wrap this
video up because I'm sure it's been very
long and after you see this video I can
go back to normal vlogging and talk
about it as things happen you know I'm
gonna go to the printers and see my book
being printed I'm gonna sign some copies
apparently I'm gonna show you the cover
when that's done I'll just take you
along and let me know if you want me to
let me know if you enjoyed this video
and hearing about all the little steps
and the process involved with writing
and creating a book it's been an
absolute roller coaster so far I can't
believe I'm like even at this point I
feel like three months ago it was a very
different story and I'm
we proud of myself that I've managed to
write a book I can't believe it just
saying that I just it's crazy I don't
even know what there is left to say but
the announcement video hasn't got up yet
at this point so I'm not gonna say thank
you for real comments but I'm sure
you're all very supportive and I can't
wait to bring you all along on this
journey I can't wait for the book to
actually come out in March and that is
all for this very very long rambling
video thank you guys so much and I'll
see you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
