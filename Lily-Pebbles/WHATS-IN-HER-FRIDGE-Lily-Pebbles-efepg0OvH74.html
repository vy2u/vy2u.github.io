little bit different actually I've
always wanted to do what's in my fridge
because I love watching those sort
videos but me and rich are terrible
adults and we never food shop and we
always like panic food shop and we don't
know what to buy and my fridge is
basically always empty so I thought
instead I would do what's in my fridge
with one of my best friends Jemma you
guys probably know her from previous
videos she's a massive foodie she's
trained nutritionist as well but she's
not going to be giving nutritional
advice as such more just talking through
what's in her fridge and the sort of
things she likes to eat and snack on and
I think it'll be really fun just to kind
of go through her fridge and have a bit
of a look so I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video now I'm gonna head to
Gemma's and look in her fridge let's go
okay so I'm here at Gemma's now and
we're gonna look through her fridge okay
this is my fridge boring horrible great
fridge that's tiny so inside we have
talked you through like my staple things
you'll always find in my face so you'll
always find organic eggs I like my
little egg holder as well so eggs are
like one of those things that we always
turn to like if we didn't plan a meal or
on the weekend brunch or sometimes I'll
do them in a salad for lunch for work or
something or hard-boiled them as a snack
we just always have eggs in the fridge
so this I love almond milk you'll see a
lot of almond related not related really
products because I love almonds and
anything kind of not related so I'll
show you lots of things so this is the
rude health almond milk I love this one
it's it's kind of the only one that
tastes kind of almond D and not watery a
lot of them and also it doesn't have
sugar in which a lot of them do and this
one is organic and I personally prefer
to where possible eat organic food
especially kind of most of my protein so
my animal protein fish meat will be
organic or my dairy so keep so Ben has
normal milk so again organic
semi-skimmed so that's kind of that
stuff and then so on the dairy I eat so
my breakfast every day pretty much is
one of these I like the individual ones
because then it's just a portion and
it's just ready to go and I like to
sprinkle some flower seeds in it
sometimes I chop up a banana in it one
goes nuts I'll show you some other
things I pin it but pretty much
definitely in the working week I take
one of those to work that's like the
base of my breakfast and then we're
trying this at the moment because it's
higher in protein but it's just a bit
glad let me you like it so that's like
breakfast stuff from the fridge then at
the moment so this week so today is
Monday so this week's if Monday's quite
a good Dick's we usually get a food
delivery on a weekend and then we'll
plan our meals out for the whole week so
at the moment I thought I could
yesterday some organic salmon you can
see that's a meal that's lunch tomorrow
so that's the Ben that's whole wheat
noodles organic salmon and vegetables
like spinach carrots I think there's
some spring onions i grilled the salmon
I think with soy sauce and roasted seeds
and some honey maybe I think and then
that's the leftover two pieces which
I'll make a lunch of me from one and
then there's another meal there as well
so then we've got an organic beef
stir-fry pack so that's war and then
I'll mix that with really noisy sorry
quite like that one it's got a mixture
of broccoli cabbage spring onions
carrots kind of all different nice
colored different veg I get up with some
noodles or some quinoa or something like
that one evening and that would stretch
over there's probably about 2 or 3 meals
in that pack so I would stretch over a
dinner and a lunch maybe I'm quite into
tempeh I don't know if anyone's even
tried it I hadn't really tried it so
quite recently we went on holiday and a
sit there and it looks like a brain I
mean it looks so weird I don't know if
you can see that at all but it's
basically it's a cultured Sawyer product
so it's a vegetarian protein and I
really like the texture it's kind of
it's like it's not like tofu which I
find a bit to smooth it doesn't really
fill me up it's got a bit of grit like
because it's got pieces of soya bean in
it it kind of has a bit more of an
interesting texture to it so quite like
that sometimes then we'll have the beef
in a stir fry and I'll have something
like a tempeh which I'll just slice up
and fry in the stir-fry
then we've got we usually every meat
will pretty much always order a chicken
because it does for meals and just hung
it in the oven and we're good to go do
it with some sweet potato or something
so again this is a whipped Rose organic
chicken I would always buy organic meat
personally I prefer to eat as I said
before protein that is organic
so that would that we do that like one
evening and then that would be that
evenings meal and the next day's lunch
or something like that some hummus just
for snacking always have that in
approach there is some not very nice
looking but half-eaten mackerel I see
you been had the other half of lunch
today so that again would go in a salad
or maybe on the weekend we'd have it
with scrambled eggs and some I quite
like I'll show you my freezer I keep
right so I quite like scrambled egg on
rye bread with some mackerel that would
warm up in the oven or something
listen sliced watermelon at the moment
actually not very open it it's not very
nice one bit pale but yeah that was from
yesterday always some fruits and some
apples and they're just basic salad
stuff because we both work all week so
it always take five days a week we'll
take our own lunch
homemade into work so there'll be like
celery this week they mess up our order
usually I'd have some kale and some
spinach I think I've got a bit of
spinach left but they messed up the
order this week so for some reason they
sent us an iceberg lettuce so we'll just
have that this week instead veg so
there's some fat pack Troy and broccoli
baby corn chip snap peas I'd steam that
or something probably not back with the
chicken got like normal mustard and
mayonnaise and things like that in the
back but that's all boring you don't
really want to see that some lemons or
like squeeze sometimes squeeze it on
something we're cooking or make a
dressing with it or something like that
so I think that's kind of it for the
fridge and I I'm a real snacky person so
I'll show you some of my cupboard stuff
and my snacks and things that go with
our meals to kind of make them a bit
more filling and interesting so we'll
move over to the cupboard stuff so I
showed you the chicken before so we'd
always have something like some sweet
potato that I
cut up put a bit of oil on and put
coconut oil probably and put it in the
oven
I discovered a while ago now that you
can get naan like they take the flavor
out of coconut oil so if you don't like
the taste of it you can use the non
flavoured ones and it's just the same as
using any oil and it's so much better
for you so we'll just usually slice them
up like wedges put them in the oven at
the same time as you make a chicken and
then that makes quite a nice meal
together obviously it's better as well
and so cupboard stuff I'll start with
breakfast things and then I'll move on
to snacky things so every day Ben will
have porridge in the summer sometimes we
make a Bertram muesli with it so we'll
soak it overnight in some milk and
yoghurt and then the next day he'll add
some raisins or we'll grate an apple or
something like that I try not to add
juice I know a lot of recipes add like
orange juice or apple juice to it I try
not to do that because of its being high
in sugar and but every day anyway he'll
have oats with milk and then he'll
sprinkle some flax sunflower pumpkin
sesame and goji berry and this actually
isn't the one that he likes the best the
best one I think is the one with
cinnamon and if it's so hard to find you
can only find it in some health food
shops so this one is just easy to come
by so we have this one at the moment
he's sprinkle like a tablespoon of that
and then he'll put a big handful of
mixed nuts we go through a bag that size
a week I will snack on them easily all
the time and Ben hasn't practiced every
day so we'll go to about like that and
then I'll sprinkle some raisins usually
we try and buy organic again we're
trying to buy organic nuts but for some
reason the bags are way smaller so it
doesn't work out as economical so we
just say well it's it works out better
to buy normal chemical we do and and so
he'll have then some raisin so it makes
like a mixture of AM you see with the
porridge if you like every day and then
I will have the yoghurt that I showed
you before and then I'll have a sprinkle
of sunflower sea of pumpkin seeds rather
that I will take to work with me and
I'll add immediately like as I'm going
to eat it rather than soaking them I
really like them because
they're high in magnesium and they've
gotta meet three and I just find that
they are something that I I really like
the taste I really like the crunch and
they just seemed to satisfy with the
yogurt for me they satisfy that kind of
I want like a granola but I don't want
it to be really sugary so adding some
mix seeds or some mixed nuts kind of
does the same so sometimes in the summer
I'll soak chia seeds in almond milk and
it goes jellied and it makes like a
pudding I quite like that sometimes if I
want it something else instead of a
yogurt and then other things that will
you'll always find in our cupboard it's
an organic whole wheat actually that one
isn't holy well sometimes it will be
home eating sometimes it won't this week
I thought to bulk up our salads with
some vegetarian protein
I bought some mixed beans we could soak
our own sometimes we do we actually have
them in there to soak but it just takes
time and preparation so I just bought it
in this week because it's easier and
then snack wise I am so into these I
mean it's a bit naughty because they're
quite sugary they're basically it's
called
cashew cookie and it's just got cashews
and dates and that's it so it's quite
sugary because obviously dates are dried
fruit but it if I want a bar of
chocolate or something and I'm just not
going to have it because I don't need to
eat it every day or you know I've had
too much or I just want to be a bit
healthier I'll have something like that
because the nuts the cashews obviously
make it have protein in it and I just
think they yummy and then I'm really
into the pecan pie one as well at the
moment which is dates pecans and almonds
so again I said before almonds and my
thing so anything with almonds in it I'm
sold
and then I found these quite recently
which was quite impressed by cos they're
I'm the type of person that if I had a
jar of peanut butter in the house I'll
take a spoon to it and I'll just keep
eating out the jar because I love it so
much the same with almond butter
we just don't buy it because I will just
go through it so these are good because
they rash on you it's just a little 30
gram packet and then you know you can
finish it it's okay you didn't eat the
whole jar it's just a nice kind of size
so I quite like these this is the
coconut almond butter one but they do an
almond butter by itself they do a peanut
by itself and it doesn't have palm oil
in it which is I quite like that about
it and you can just take it on the go so
sometimes I'll have it before I go to
the gym because it kind of gives me a
bit of a boost or other times I'll just
have it as an afternoon snack or a
mid-morning snack it's quite good stuff
at work these been families recently
they're really young they are tiny
little so on the back they've got like
little balls that is what they look like
inside their tiny little balls have
rolled up with ingredients but they've
got let me read it to you so they
contain dates peanuts whey powder which
sub sleep protein powder and then
they've got some milk fruit juice
concentrate rice starch at a pinch of
Himalayan salt which for a protein snack
it's not so terrible and I just think
really gooey which I quite like if other
ones like these I don't find they've got
a bit more of an artificial taste like
they get sweetness in and I just don't
really like them as much been quite
lights please before the gym but I
prefer those ones they're probably not
that great for you but they're a nice
little protein put me up so that's my
fridge and my cupboards they weren't the
most full they've ever been but
hopefully got a bit of an insight into
what we eat and you can see that we kind
of try and keep it balanced and eat
normal food and not just you know really
really healthy or really really
unhealthy thanks for watching don't
anyway then I'll kill you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
