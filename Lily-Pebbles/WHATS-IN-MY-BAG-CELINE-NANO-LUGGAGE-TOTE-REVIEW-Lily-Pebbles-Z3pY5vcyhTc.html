to be doing a what's in my bag but also
a review of my saline nano luggage tote
handbag I don't know about you guys but
whenever I'm thinking about spending a
bit more money on an item it's usually
handbag sometimes tech like laptops or
phones I always go straight to YouTube
first to watch a review I rarely make a
purchase without watching video reviews
first and finding out pros and cons of
an item and just hearing what people
think of it plus seeing it like live and
a video form so I thought if it's such
an important thing for me then I want to
kind of put my opinion out there onto
the internet for other people who are
looking for thoughts about handbags and
things like that but I wanted to do it
in a way that felt right for me I don't
love unboxing videos because I'm not
sure exactly what the point of them are
I mean I love watching them but I just
don't really see the point of them and I
also find what's in my bags quite boring
these days as well there'll always be
something in the stole joke about what's
in my bag video but I wanted to kind of
review my bags for you guys I wanted to
do it after having them for quite a long
period of time so that I can actually
tell you really what I think of it and
how its kind of worked into my wardrobe
and just give loads of kind of honest
feedback so I hope you guys like this if
it's not for you don't worry there'll be
a new video soon but for those people
who type in saline nano luggage tote
handbag and want a review before they
buy it I'm hoping this video is helpful
for you guys so this is the bag and I
bought this about ten months ago and
buying the beginning of the year I
actually bought it in Paris I didn't
realize this but the bag was a bit
cheaper because I bought it in Paris I
don't know if that's the case with all
brands that obviously it's a French
brand but I got lucky and it was more
cheaper to buy in France and it was also
like a really special experience I was
there for Paris Fashion Week and it was
so nice to go into the Saline store I
feel like a lot of the pleasure of
buying something new is the actual
shopping so I feel like if you can go
into the store of the brand because you
get really good service and you can also
see all the different colors available
so this is the Nano luggage tote comes
in all different sizes this is the size
that I love
the most I didn't love this bag when it
first came out it's been out for a
really long time it kind of looks like a
face but I fell in love with it I've
already spoken briefly about this in my
handbag collection video so I'll try not
to repeat myself I'll quickly skim over
what this one looks like it's three
colors a kind of beige color black
leather and then this kind of softer
blue suede here I love the pop of color
because I always go for black bags just
because I always want to get my like
money's worth and make sure that I can
wear it with every outfit but with this
one I was a little bit brave and went
for a pop of color I love blue so I I
know that it's gonna go with the sort of
things I wear and it has two handles
which are kind of structured and just
sit there and then a long strap as well
I usually wear this crossbody and it
sits just by my hip I really like the
link that it sits up obviously that's
gonna be different depending on your
height and yeah this strap isn't
adjustable so although it works
perfectly for me that might be something
to consider if you're smaller or taller
you're kind of just stuck with the
length because it doesn't adjust it has
these little clips on the side I never
really take the strap off I always use
this one but it's nice to have the
option and I guess you could replace
this if you really want to disrupt that
was adjustable what I love about this
bag is although it's a small bag you can
fit so much in and the bag itself is
really really lightweight so you can
really stuff it full and it doesn't make
the bag too heavy suddenly to note is
because I got the lighter shade I found
that you can't actually see it that
badly anymore but when I first got it I
found that this part of the bag starts
to turn a bit blue where it rubbed on my
jeans I think because it's such a soft
leather
it just really catches kind of fabric
color very easily I like to kind of wear
my bags you know and I don't mind that
it looks worn I think I could probably
use some leather wipes if I wanted to
clean this up see honest doesn't look
that bad anymore I think it was just at
the beginning when this was so clean it
looked really obvious and I always wear
the bag kind of that way anyway so you
don't really see it but just something
to note when you are getting the lighter
leather color that probably will happen
good a little hook here maybe that's
when you want to hang your bag somewhere
I don't know I never really use that the
hardware is gold I always tend to go for
gold hardware if I can because all my
jewelry is gold or rose gold it's my
favorite kind of metal so me show you
what's in my bag but
the purpose of showing you how much can
fit in it because I did a little poll on
Twitter asking you guys if you'd prefer
just a review or what's in my bag and a
lot of people said what's in my bag said
that they can actually see how much it
holds and as I said this is a magic bag
it holds so much stuff so the zip kind
of comes up which gives it more space
and because the bag goes out on the side
that also gives it more space so I'm
just gonna open it up okay right on the
top here is an umbrella I love the fact
this bag fits an umbrella in because
it's always raining in London and I've
got frizzy curly hair so having the
security of an umbrella in my bag is
amazing and that's one of the reasons I
use this bag a lot this isn't like a
mini umbrella this is just the standard
small sized umbrella and yeah you can
easily fit that in that bag if I didn't
have the umbrella in my bag I could fit
my I could fit my notepad and my
external hard drive in there but I don't
really tend to have those and the
umbrella at the same time because things
get a little bit squishy I've also got a
little beauty bag this is just like I
got sent some Chanel makeup and it came
in this cute little bag so in here I
keep all my like little things just
quickly I've got some spoons
I've got ESOP hand sanitizer estee
lauder Victoria Beckham lip liner a
mirror
Alana lips lip balm Victoria Beckham
lipstick a very cute mini Urban Decay
concealer and a matte lipstick so just a
few lipstick lip balms that kind of
stuff in there I've also got some gloves
that I've rolled up I've got this for
Christmas last year they're like long
cashmere gloves my purse this is a
little Chanel purse I got this for my
graduation present this was the first
ever designer thing I got me and my mom
went Selfridges together and it was very
exciting
it's what silver hardware because back
in the day silver was my thing but I
still love it it's just a cute kind of
easy to pocket purse thing my keys car
keys and house keys and my phone and
this is the iPhone 7 plus so it's the
big phone so that's everything that's in
my bag pretty much everything I need to
be honest I'm not the sort of person
that carries that much in their bag you
could definitely fit the Olympus PEN
camera in here be honest you could
probably fit my SLR camera in here as
well if you didn't put much else in it
it's very like wide easy to open bag and
as I said it's very lightweight so you
can really pack it full and it doesn't
like really hurt your show
because it doesn't get that heavy it had
this little front pocket here but I
never use this it's tiny I'm not really
sure what its purpose is maybe like oh
I've got some curvy grips in here or
maybe like some pound coins I think it's
more just like decorative purposes and
it says Celine Paris there and gold what
else can I say about this bag I get so
much wear out of it I really do wear it
almost like every day just because it
fits so much in I love it I definitely
think it's a good purchase I'm very
happy with this bag after having it for
almost a year I do not regret purchasing
this I think it's a very handy bag and
it will last me a really long time I
like how it can sit by itself if you
place it on a table although I would
have liked it to have a little kind of
legs otherwise you just put it on the
floor and the leather goes straight on
the floor was I like it when there's a
little like metal legs to put it on
other than that other than little legs
and the fact that the leather marks
quite easily on the back I don't think
there's any like flaws with this bag the
zip doesn't do up completely so although
it does up and it doesn't very easily
once the zip is done up you can see
there's like two holes either side which
if it's pouring with rain could be
annoying although I wouldn't really want
to get this bag wet anyway so yeah I
don't think it's not like unsafe to have
those gaps there they're not big enough
also I've just noticed actually the blue
the blue suede is quite marked there
probably need to find a way of cleaning
that only there for some reason I'm not
sure why don't if you can see that I
think it's wearing pretty well actually
it's very kind of sturdy and yeah I'm
probably gonna leave it there that was
quicker than I thought it would be but
hopefully it's helpful for those of you
who have googled Selina nano luggage
tote and you want to know whether to buy
it I think it's a great bag and let me
know if you want me to do more of these
I have a few bags that I could kind of
review after having them for a long
period of time I don't know if this is
interesting to those of you who aren't
looking to buy the bag please do let me
know and if I've missed out anything
please leave me a question in the
comment section and I'll try and answer
it I'm not really planning on discussing
pricing in these sort of videos because
I don't know
I'm very English and don't love doing
those kind of things and I also think if
you're thinking about buying this bag
you've probably already looked into the
price and stuff so there's no need for
me to mention it pricing is different in
every country anyway thank you guys so
much for watching and please don't
forget to subscribe to my channel and
check out my last video if you would
like to I think that's all I'll see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
