to be doing a good old fashioned what's
in my bag video I've had this bag now
for a few months maybe I actually can't
remember I really should have looked
into that first and I thought I'd have
had it for a few months
it's the Gucci Soho disco bag and it is
a very very popular bag so I wanted to
add my opinion to the internet tell you
guys what I think of it show you what's
inside I like what your needs so I
thought you would too so as I said it's
called the Soho disco bag and it's by
Gucci my phone is ringing inside the bag
hello yeah I'm literally just filming
can I call you back
Thanks so my friend Livia very kindly
picked this up for me at Heathrow
Airport so I actually got 17 I think it
was about 17 percent of the original
price it's already quite an affordable
bag and when I say that I don't mean
affordable for a designer so Gucci it's
one of their lower priced bag so I
already have to get a bit of extra money
off that and it's totally been worth it
it would have been worth full price I've
worn this pretty much every day since I
got it and this is a big statement I
would say this is the bag
I am most happy with out of my entire
collection it's the most practical bag I
own and I love it it's all leather the
strap is also leather so they have one
chain this is the leather one it is
adjustable which is great because if
you're shorter or taller you can make it
longer longer longer or shorter I think
I put it on the shortest one and I wear
it either on my shoulder or crossbody
the only thing about having a leather
strap is I think it makes it a little
bit less smart if you're wearing it in
the evening than the chain but I feel it
is so much more practical for like a day
bag the only thing that's really wrong
with this bag which I knew before I
bought it so I've done loads of research
I'm going to watch those videos like
this is that this part kind of slapped
like that so what I've done is I've just
I undid it I added a little hairband and
then I just tuck it in but it did come
with a spare piece of leather so I'm
thinking going to get a little with the
cord like a little loop made so that I
could tuck it in I just haven't run to
doing that yet I also like that it's
attached at the bottom by a metal ring
which means it will be a bit more hard
wearing and it will last longer the
shape of it is this like cute little
rectangle and you can see if I so it
makes my
face how big is it has the Gucci logo
embossed on the front but because it's
black it's not that obvious and like
gold logo so it's kind of subtle but
really pretty and it's got gold hardware
but it's not yellow gold it's like a
mixed in silver in gold and then as it
is this tassel and when you're wearing
it if you're kind of right-handed you
are across the body that way the tassel
hangs at the back which I really like I
love this bag because you can fit so
much more in it than you'd think it's a
bit like my saline bag in that way it's
a bit of a magic bag you won't believe
how much stuff is in here when I start
showing you I think you'll be surprised
at how much I can really fit in here
which is why I keep wearing it I keep
going back to it because I always think
remember another bag I'll know that this
one I can fit my vlogging camera in my
tripod it's so great I really like that
in this grainy leather I always try to
go for that in a bag if I can just
because I know when it scratches easily
I've got Foundation and stuff on this
accidentally when I've been shopping and
it's just white straight off so I
literally have no marks on it which I'm
really really happy about I can't fit my
notebook in it mine's a size obviously I
can't fit like an iPad or anything like
that but it is so great and I'm going to
show you what inside so the zip open
very easily I think it was Megan Ella
B's video I was watching before I bought
this that said if it's not full zip
doesn't open as easier which is
something to note but my bag tends to be
quite full most the time I'm just going
to pull things out here and show you
guys how much I can really fit in this
is what I was packing to my bag in a
usual kind of weekday when I out and
about all day the first thing is my
phone this is the iPhone 7 plus there
are a lot of handbags that will not fit
the phone in which is very annoying but
I love it I love the phone so much I
love the size I love the camera quality
and still happy I got it and I have the
eye ring on it as well which makes it
more bulky but as you can see it fits
absolutely fine in this one I also have
a phone charger annoyingly Apple don't
make the charging cases for the 7 plus
and I don't really like those portable
chargers you have to charge because I
always forget to charge them so I just
have a normal app Achara
although this is the extra long lead
it's a 2 meter lead Claire from hey
Claire told me about this over Christmas
and it's changed my life it's just so
nice to have a lead that's really long
you can buy those in the ass
door yeah I've got my car keys on here
is a little key ring
shanell keyring which was a gift and an
anthropology keyring which is a gold l I
really like I've also got my purse which
is from Chanel I've shown you guys this
before it was a graduation present for
me when I was 21 I don't love it I use
it because well it's Chanel it was a
gift and I did love it for years but I
find it quite bulky now and I do want to
get something a bit smaller if I can but
I have that which has all my cards and
money and stuff in it and I've also got
aspinall of London
card holder that has LP on it this is a
gift and it's got my oyster card in it
or I use that for the tube I have some
Vaseline which is what my dermatologist
has been recommending I use on my lips
just because it's got nothing in it I
have oh I've got a snapper Jack's
wrapper I do if any of you guys used to
do this at school well clearly not at
school I still do it but when you're
finished with a crisp wrapper I wrap it
up into this tiny little mini triangle
and I really remember my friends jealous
from school teaching me how to do this
and then when you stick them on our
fingers and draw faces and use them as
finger puppet that is really sad it's a
true story I also have my vlogging
camera in here which is the canon g7x
mark two wrong with the flippy screens
that flips up and down this is actually
a replacement camera Canon has lent me
because my camera the audio started
going funny do we know what happened
that this one is going strong also have
my man frost oh tripod I mean this is
huge and it fits in the bag I'm still
going it's still stuff in here it's
crazy
this fit bike perfectly in this bag and
I use this when I'm vlogging either to
put my camera up on a table next to me
or somehow then hold it and vlog the
source and cars get further away this is
so good I much prefer this to the
gorilla pod because it's more sturdy the
Gorillapod I found just moved too much
it really kind of drove me a bit insane
this one is really good you can make it
wide to make it lower and if you press
this button this top box part moves
which means you can position the camera
up down sideways whatever this is great
I've also got some lip products this is
the duo from Charlotte Tilbury the
pillow-talk lip cheat lip pencil which
has been around for ages and I love it
and she's just bought out the
stick to go alongside it so this is the
pillow-talk lipstick I'm wearing them
both today really nice rose pink love
them I have 10 P and then there's a
little back pocket so there's a front
pocket which I sometimes never really
use the inside blinded like how about a
linen fabric which is nice if I finally
when it's leather it's just going to get
so grubby this will get grubby but it
kind of works as a pocket in the front
don't really use and then be slightly
bigger pocket on the back which I've got
a few things in I've got two hair bands
a sick one and a thin one and how does
this little mirror I would like to have
a mirror on me I can do my lipstick or
any check my face and I have two tampons
the yellow one and that's everything but
that is so much stuff so you can see it
opens really wide and it very looks
flexible sometimes I find I think it was
the same luron the sack bag or something
like that I Lipstadt a while ago when
you put your hand in it it kind of hurts
because it doesn't open wide nothing you
catch it on the zip or don't if that one
houses it I find some back isn't really
hard to get in sewers this one opens
really wide it's very very like movable
and flexible and well I fit one two
three four five six seven eight nine 10
11 like 12 things in it a camera phone a
purse a tripod lit pull up the charger
like big things as well so I'm really
really happy with this bag I've had
loads of messages from you guys asking
if I'd recommend it and I definitely
would I'm seriously happy with this
purchase so I really hope you guys
enjoyed the seen what's in my Gucci's
