I'm not happy to be up I'm just having
some avocado on toast forcing myself to
eat something because I know I will get
so hungry in like an hour and a half
this morning I'm going to the gym I
started with a new personal trainer and
she's a she and she's a friend of a
friend and it's going really well I
missed last week because I was a bit
like shaken up after the coughing but
before then it was going well I quite
like having a female trainer
I still hate working out though but I
don't like dread it and want to cry as
much I don't know we'll see how today
goes obviously because it's vlogmas i
will bring you guys along with me hoping
there's no one else in the gym allies
that would be really awkward
have a nice day at work dear this is my
new water bottle that I got from Urban
Outfitters but I've had to hide it and
just get it out every time rich like
leaves to work because I bought one for
him and gray for his sake and I don't
want him to see it so yeah this is my
like a secret or to put a bits glass so
it's good for you and all that okay
the time has come I need to go
Oh
taking
I was finished my training session and I
filmed a little bit I couldn't film too
much because last time we trained in the
gym it was empty but there were quite a
few people there today and I didn't want
to like get anyone in the shot and
people would just get freaked out and
they see a camera it was good there was
a section of the workout that involved a
plank that made me want to actually die
and she's pretty tough he's like get
back up she's a teacher as well as a
trainer so she can be scary but I did
well and I did it and it's over now for
a whole another week that is my reward
I'm gonna head home and have a shower
make my face look better and eat some
food I think I'm gonna make myself okay
I can go the healthy option which would
be like salmon avocado and eggs but we
also have bacon man I could really do
the bacon sandwich this is like big life
decisions right here obviously I went
for the bacon sandwich with ketchup I've
just been taking my Instagram shots I'm
gonna post it now actually looks like
this and these are my biscuits before ie
I think I'm gonna eat the reindeer one
first because it's my least favorite
this one was really fun to make because
you just use the piping icing to get all
the texture for the tree and then you
put sugar on it to make it look like
snow
this one looks the most complicated but
I found it the easiest I really enjoyed
doing the snowflake and it looks the
most impressive snowman's cute there's a
little arms on this one as well looks
way more impressive than it is you just
use the toothpick to do these bits the
Christmas pudding our DAC chili to fill
in these little bits and also the not IV
what's a good combo that's called but
it's really hard to do the president is
cute I really like my little bow and
gift tag and the other present the
reindeer was really hard not a big fan
at this one so I'm gonna eat this first
I guess we need to eat them all at some
point we're just like I don't know it's
like all that hard work just to eat it
I'm doing that gross thing where I'm
procrastinating having a shower because
I just want to get on with some work I'm
definitely gonna shower before I go out
but I think I'm gonna sit here and do
some editing and then shower and get
ready because I can't be bothered at the
moment oh so we got this little like
biscuit baking and icing
when we did the course and we got a
certificate biscuity school of icing
certificate of brilliance I love a
certificate because I never ever got
them at school we used to have a school
yellow and a green one one was for good
behavior ones for good work and I'd get
the good behavior one quite a lot I
never ever got the yellow one for good
work so I do love a certificate I've
just run out the shower quickly done my
hair and makeup and got dressed because
Caroline's doing a Facebook live on the
glamour Facebook page and I really
wanted to watch while I have my lunch
Caroline I'm doing something a little
bit different tonight made me just
straighten you up I'm going to one of
the hirtius ins hair salons because I'm
doing a talk by no Luke Harrison and he
asked me if I could come in and do a
talk for all of his stylists so all the
different hair stylists from the
different branches are gonna come to one
I'm gonna do a talk for them and I'm not
entirely sure what they're trying to
gain out of it but he wants them to
understand what I do and how it works
and how I started and all of that and
then do like an informal Q&amp;amp;A so I've
never ever done anything like this I
think it's gonna be pretty informal
banging it's really annoying I think
it's gonna be pretty informal it's not
like a big presentation or anything but
I need to prepare like an intro and a
bit where I talk about what I do know
these are so annoying so I'm just gonna
sit here now and talk to myself I think
when doing the talk it's really
important to practice it out loud as
many times as possible I've written
notes like Who I am how it started how
it continued after uni like little big
bullet points for me to follow if I need
to hopefully I won't have to look at it
but it's just something I have there's
like a bit of a security blanket so I'm
gonna sit in out sit down and so for now
I'll put you guys down here and I'm
gonna pretend to do my talk like a few
times
so Abbotsford that you guys had a while
I've just been sitting and doing what
we're trying to do work I've got
something like emails and stuff done but
honestly I'm having a bit of a blogging
block at the moment I just tweeted about
this I've got like five blog posts worth
of photos that I really want to get out
like especially before Christmas but
every time I go and tight I'm just like
well I can't think of anything like good
to say and I write it and that just
sounds so rubbish so I don't really know
what's going on I'm like not really in
love with blogging at the moment maybe
it's because i'm doing vlogmas and so
many videos and stuff I'm just used to
talking but I am ready to go now I'm
gonna head into town I want to find
something to wear tomorrow night Tania
and Jim Tanya burr and Jim Chapman if
you watch them on YouTube are having a
little Christmas get-together at their
house and I think like it's a little bit
like dressy rpu not like super small but
I think the girls kind of like make an
effort to like Christmas dress Christmas
party outfit kind of thing and I just
thought I might have a quick look in the
shops and see if there's anything that
is kind of right for a party in a house
rather than like a bar I also want to
pop into anthropology because I always
like to bring like a little gift like I
want to get a Tania Jim a little
Christmas gift I know exactly what I
want to get them I think this video will
be up like by the time the party starts
anyway so I don't have to worry about
giving it away but um there are a couple
of mugs in anthropology that I really
want to get one says Jay one that says
tea because I know that Tania loves her
mugs and these ones I just think a
beautiful I saw them and I had to polish
it a while ago I thought who can I get
one of those for and I think this is the
perfect time I'm wrapping up because it
looks really cold Ashley I'm gonna grab
an umbrella I think it's raining and
these are the gloves that my friends got
me for my birthday and love them there's
my old tripod things very handy
yeah I'm not being smart because this is
just like a really casual talk thing so
no need to dress up but I think I'm
pretty bored of doing like the little
travel sequence of like me going on the
tube thing so I'm sure you guys are
bored of it too so I'll just speak to
you when I'm in town just
pathology I thought I'll show you the
marks I'm gonna get you in Konya is this
one that says Jerry and this one says t9
hit they're really pretty it look like
this me like hand-painted and they're
really big as well so like guys top shop
it made it snow again now heading them
to came to pick up all my peer box stuff
from yesterday that's why I didn't show
you because I left it here I'll show you
tonight and then me and George you're
gonna go to Hurston's together there's
some kind of show going on in here today
so I've got a vlog it because there's no
other youtubers here I'm now and I've
had my hair washed I'm gonna get quick
blow-dry or I do
Jordan did my hair can use straightness
to get like a long soft wave and I
really like it now I have to talk to
everyone I am a blogger a youtuber an
instagramer snapchatter marketing people
call us influences that we hate there
and Americans cool as content creators
so I have no idea what my job title is
when people ask me I just like make
something up
I started my blog in January 2010
this is everyone guys I am home and the
talk was so good I've already gotten
company clothes but I can't talk my now
because my travel sickness levels are
about a seven I feel like I'm gonna
throw up everywhere and I haven't eaten
dinner and it's like it's half 9:00 my
hair smells so good ok I need to make
myself in food whilst breathing through
my nose and out through my mouth I'm
just making myself a quick chicken
stir-fry
got myself a chicken stir-fry that's
actually really quick to make and it
smells amazing so excited to eat this
and then I will chat to you guys I had
to tie up my hair I'm so sorry I know I
just got my hair done but it won't last
till tomorrow anyway because my hair
doesn't last overnight and you know I
told you my rule yesterday but I have my
hair up when I'm at home I'm gonna eat
my stir-fry and then I'll show you guys
what's in my peer box because I promised
that I would I'm all refueled I've eaten
I feel better car sickness is gone so
now I can tell you about the talk and I
really really enjoyed it actually
I had no idea how it was gonna go
because why don't really do talk that
often unless they're kind of like google
talks are just like a bit kind of bigger
this is very intimate and also I was
talking to people who kind of that being
rude don't really care like they want to
know like how they can make Instagram
stuff work for them but I guess I don't
know I wasn't sure how it was gonna go
so I started by doing like a little
introduction to myself and like how I
got started with my blog and how it will
work and how I made money and everything
and I think with the first like two
minutes I could see people a bit like
and then I remember like kind of looking
up and suddenly everyone was like locked
in and they they seemed really
interested so that was good and then
when it came to the Q&amp;amp;A there were so
many questions everyone's like
interrupting each other it was so chatty
I mean hairdressers is just so fun I
love them and I'm just so jealous that
they all get to work together and have
so much fun it was really interesting it
was interesting for me to hear the
questions they had and I think it was
helpful so that was fun and now I'm home
and I promise you guys I'll show you
what I got for my peer box this isn't
everything I got semi obviously can't
keep everything alright I don't even
know where I'd put it but I take things
that kind of
relevant for me and everything else goes
to friends and family and charity so I
will show you let me like to put you
down somewhere this is like seriously
balancing on a box is not safe I really
hope you don't go flying because you
will hit the glass table let me put this
here just in case okay so what have I
walked back home and my first thing is a
lamb go for life video first thing is a
lounge where for life jumper in a medium
because I didn't have one of these I
only had the no make up day one so this
is for me and I also have a large one
that it was just like a spare in the
office I'm gonna give it to my mum she
wants one we are gonna be restocking our
jumpers early Jan so stay tuned we will
let you know there will be more sizes
available and it would be a much
smoother process okay this was a gift
the girl who basically the Hurston's
talk tonight was like a massive favor
for the brand so to say thank you
she bought me a gift oh my god I was so
excited Dipti is like my favorite brand
ever and it feels heavy okay this is one
of the Christmas candles I'm not even
gonna try and pronounce the names
because they're all like jumbled up and
it's always really hard to know babe oh
my god Bay is literally this one in the
fig one of my favorite scents um Bay is
kind of quite like black currency I
think and I absolutely love it oh no I'm
so excited because I never burn my dipti
candles cuz I'm too sad that they're
gonna run out oh my god they've like
properly given me a I've been so amazing
working with you this year thank you for
doing Hairston's talks and I have an
amazing Christmas New Year see you in
2017 oh my god God they've actually
bought me like a proper present but I
thought it was just gonna be candles
this is a little dust bag and it says
Sophie home on it as in the handbag
brand oMG this is turning into a bit of
an unboxing wasn't planning that wow
that's so nice of them
it's my average handbag as well this is
so cute it's little and it's crossbody
which I love and I actually love that
it's red because I would never buy
myself a red bag because I wouldn't have
the guts to but it was a gift and I
would 100% wear a red bag and it's got
gold hardware which is very me is that
little little handles and is it loads of
space inside is so nice I literally need
to email them right now because I've
done loads of work that Harrison's over
the year like Shawn did my wedding hair
and I like go there all the time and
pimp Jason out because I love him he's
my colorist but I really enjoyed doing
the tool that is so lovely good sorry
it's got a bit like Gashi there but I
really was expecting like when dipti
candles was excited enough I thought it
was gonna be one of those big Dipti
candles or like this would be epic this
is even more epic okay I know you know
how to go on from there cuz I feel like
everything else is gonna be a bit of an
anti-climax
now I'm from there here's some bag of
products I have this which is new from V
chic which is a French skincare brand
and it's the ID Lea P Lane radiant
activating night peeling care so it's a
glycolic acid like peel and the PR that
I met was like this is new and it's
meant to be amazing so I'd love to say
about it now - haven't tried it but I'm
excited to try it this I'm excited to
try because this is new from LA
roche-posay it's a waterproof eye makeup
remover it's coming out in January and I
think it's like under 10 pounds it's
pretty affordable and I always love try
new waterproof eye makeup remover ana
China's last night she said it's amazing
so I'm gonna give it a go tonight I also
really like the packaging of that this
is from bliss I thought this looked
really interesting because it's blood
orange and white pepper and that sounds
like it's gonna smell YUM and it's a
soapy suds so it's a body wash but it's
also a bubble bath and I like ones that
do both because then you can like use it
in the bath but it also makes bubbles
woo
tangy it smells good though I love the
packaging for this go make such a mess
rich gonna kill me okay I'm gonna go
through these pretty speedy this is from
by Terry and it is her bombed rose
just like a range I love and the hand
cream I love a good hand cream look how
beautiful the packaging is to this I
just love the bomb diverse range so I
think that would be really nice as well
instant snow a common bought this came
with but I was like a lot of it of
instance know how fun would that be to
do with the kids I think you just add a
bit of water and it turns into smoke
this is from the wash pose a and it's
the Anthelios extra-large XL long as
these Jim bless me this is the 50-plus
SPF and I'm going away in January so I
would definitely use this because you
guys know I am very much into my SPF and
I really like lavash pose a SPFs as well
they're really good this is a manuka
honey it's from a brand called manuka
health oh yeah I think the brands good
manuka health manuka honey is so good so
many things I love it when I'm ill put
like spoonful into hot water with lemon
or just have the honey by itself it's
not like normal honey I think a lot of
people think that you can just have
honey but manuka honey is like a
specific type of honey really good for
you and it really helps in your L so
this will be very handy to have in the
cupboard oh yeah this is so cute I got a
package from Dior and inside was this
like really pretty box I thought it
might be a candle but then I opened it
up a minute it's a snow globe a Dior
snow globe it's got a gold Christmas
tree loads of presents a perfume and
like a chair with a handbag on it that
is so pretty which is gonna be like no
we are not having that in the flat and
I'm gonna be like yeah we are deal with
it okay
I also got sadness from Dior which is
they're backstage brush collection so I
haven't opened it yet but it comes with
a case and then on two three four five
little travel brushes in it and I feel
that was really nice this one was pretty
exciting and I always get more excited
when I get something like edible in my
pierre box this was sent from cordially
they have their own spa in bordeaux is
it bordeaux my parents have been and has
been everyone's been and i'm so jealous
i would love to go to the cordially spa
but they make their and wine there and
they actually sent this one to me so
it's a 2011
wine I'm gonna pretend unlike uh some
kind of wine connoisseur how'd you even
get this out this darling is 2011 gone
kook less a chateau Smith wait what sort
of wine is this oh no I don't know much
about wine but I like good wine this is
definitely a red and so I am going to
take this over to my parents house on
Christmas Eve me and rich are going
around there to spend the evening with
my parents I'm gonna leave my mom her
stocking and I think me give this to my
dad and we can open it up and all enjoy
it together because they've been there
they loved the wine there I think he'll
appreciate a good 2011 red 2011 a good
year I don't know I'm assuming so thank
you cordially by love being sent alcohol
obviously oh god how do I get this back
in okay there's any one more thing this
is this is kind of interesting actually
so I got this box I was like old net
support a it's not a nice supporter it's
a brand of beauty pie Sameach nom
oh no waaay back double knotted it so
it's this really cool box you open up
come to this little booklet and then
inside is this loads of makeup and it
all says beauty pie on it looks like
this kind of teeth of powder parts
mascara lip liner eyeliner lipsticks lip
products foundation so I'll into the
booklet and it says all your makeup
without the markup
I mean I'm learning with you guys on
December the 6th shopping for makeup
will change forever so that's already
been at beauty pie our mission is to
bring our members the world's best
beauty products at their totally
transparent factory cost no mumbo jumbo
no middleman no markups is like the
buyers club for beauty addicts so it's
ten pounds a month you sign up and you
get a box every month of makeup that
apparently as good quality as all the
other makeup we usually buy but it's ten
pounds a month month because they're
they're paying factory price and they're
not marking it up because obviously once
you put like a brand name on something
in the packaging and you make it all
fancy and you put a marketing campaign
to it the mark-up is like crazy which
isn't always a bad thing
we like being loyal to the brands that
we like but if it's just about the
makeup you're in tune the quality this
sounds pretty cool I don't know how it
works in terms of like skin color and
stuff golden world face illuminator
that's a powder whoo that's like a
really snazzy highlighter
yeah but sure what factory is it made in
not all makeups made in the same Factory
this is really interesting though
definitely something worth looking into
ten pounds a month to get all of this
it's pretty good
okay that is everything from my Pierre
box I hope you guys enjoyed it guys just
in case you're wondering because this is
the first time I've actually got my
hands on one this is how the large fits
so the photos of me and Anna wearing the
jumpers are in the you can see they're
quite fitted this is the large so it's a
bit more like a slouchy size maybe I'll
keep this one for myself it's just got
home and we used to always make fun of
my parents for watching TV in different
rooms and he was like 11 o'clock what we
doing now and I said well I want to
watch Nashville who's that I don't know
what suit I'm wearing the bedroom and
then he was like oh no different rooms
we're an old married couple already we
just got home every unseen year sat down
yeah I need to chill your bed I was your
name
I'm gonna watch Nashville I think I'll
blog again tomorrow because I'm going to
Tonya and Jim's Christmas party like I
might feel myself getting ready I don't
know what I'm wearing though I was I
don't know how much I'm gonna vlog that
I always feel like when I'm in a party
environment I just kind of forget and I
get a bit awkward anyway I will see you
guys tomorrow
thank you for watching rich do you have
anything to add to this vlog I haven't
