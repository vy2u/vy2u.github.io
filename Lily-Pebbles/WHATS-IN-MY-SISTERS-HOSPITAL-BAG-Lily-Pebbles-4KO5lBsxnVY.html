with my sister Jojo she actually
suggested coming on to my channel and
doing a what's in my hospital bag
because in case some of you don't know
she's pregnant you can't actually see
when you carry my ultimate you stand up
at some point
whoa so this is baby number three and I
have two older sisters Carly and Jojo
Carly got two kids so just got to
another one on the way and I feel like
this video needs a disclaimer because
Carly's the sister who has a baby and
then we don't really know what happened
but whatever she had a baby to end of it
jo doesn't exhibit tells me every detail
so you have to know she's the reason I'm
terrified of having kids
warning Hara 5 I'm not really sure they
know they know okay so we're going to
talk through what else to buy good I
don't know if I'll ever do a video like
this so it's fun to have you do it yeah
well I mean okay so this is the third
time the third time around I didn't
really know I was doing and I had you
know ideas of how I thought was going to
go second time around I have to have a
desire because the first time around
didn't end so well well ended well well
I did a gorgeous baby but for me didn't
end so well so that was a learning curve
because packing your bag first time
around not knowing what to expect a
second time I'm having severe in was
quite a shock so fair play man I have to
have another zero now I know what I
needed and hopefully some of these
things will be quite helpful to you so
this is the bags that you're taking is
actually Richard bike he's lending it to
her it's from Farber and he uses all the
time for weekend's away so handy is like
a huge duffel bag I love it back and it
doesn't look huge but actually you can
fit so much in it and the biggest thing
with packing for hospital is the things
you have to take a quite bulky so you
don't really want like a big suitcase or
police to quickly put your how you
opened up quite wide okay so let's go
for so that there's a lot okay over
there in sections that's for stuff from
the mummy
so I'm going in I know I'm having
cesarean I know I'm gonna have to wear a
hospital gown if you weren't having a
cesarean is having normal bear and let's
say you wanted to add to our pool but
I'd recommend taking a bikini because
you can't get in the water with us and
not
to you anything you can wear one after
but if you don't want to like be
completely naked and on show then
wherever he is happen you can get in the
vast I'm not taking that but I am
reacting Lee Kum Kee pajamas that after
I would have my operations and hopefully
align there with a lovely baby I thought
it'd be nice to wear nice comfy big
nothing to body hugging top and I got
this mother top I like that the
oversized t-shirt from the family still
and I thought this would be really comfy
because it's not clingy I'm going to be
a little bit sore and soft its soft it's
really soft and I'm going to attempt to
breastfeed this time I try first time
didn't go so well
second time I was scared that I'm gonna
coming to go so this I thought would be
really easy to kind of like yeah one
thing about having a baby
obviously it's amazing grow a person
it's got a little person at the end of
it but you know it's quite um what's
emerged romatic
know you really let yourself go what
happens to you the nine months does
suddenly you have no control over you
have to go with it so I'll let your body
do what it's going to do and whatever
way this baby wants to come out it's
coming out and what happens to you after
makes you feel a bit gross so things
that can help you feel less gross and a
bit nicer I have been helped everyone
that I've watched quite a few before
this one just feels like I want to see
what this video is all about Lizzie will
say just take what makes you feel good
yeah so I've looked at a lot of their
maternity stuff in the shops and that
doesn't make me feel good I feel like
it's because it says Maternity I have to
follow it but actually you don't
so our thumb for menswear I went into
gap I'm at least the men's department
and I brought these are so nice I want
me yeah oh I love the real Jean bottoms
why do I have to buy maternity Jharna
bottoms just because I family baby okay
that's not the elastic isn't like car
directly I just need a bigger size or
something
country something's going to make me
feel nice so they returned a few arms
which other bands are great when you're
pregnant but afterwards actually you
just want something cozy yeah so that's
going to be my pajamas this bit is a bit
unfortunate but here
you really have a cesarean obviously
it's an operation you're going to be
stall here so you don't want your liquor
bound to be on where the operation was
so I've gone for some really large pants
again finest you can go to all the shops
and they all have maternity knickers
which you can pull up over your stomach
but you know you've just seems you're
quite a trauma do you want this is that
pull up all the way into or do you want
normal missus in a larger size wherever
you find comes here we go back so I've
talked to do and that's all breathe I
don't know a size fourteen is gonna work
also so I like lots of both okay I feel
like we need to serve whoo yeah so let's
get start out as much I don't know what
I see not you know I take your weathers
yeah I mean lettuce it's as big as my
head the sanitary ware but you need to
wear off their babies rather thick so
you need is good kids in your pants
we're going to get on to three how
different male to normal and I tried the
one time you ladies realize you have to
just succumb to it and go you know what
can't lay my lacy brief Thursday these
are via luxury items see I was saying
that when when I was at school when I
had my expect before I started wearing
tampons when I to attach stuff I had to
wear like the Keeley shorts on top to
feel like I was secure I can't just like
rock up yeah I know the difference of
these these aren't the ones that you
would wear during periods and those not
know the nighttime ones oh I know Matt
someone's at night
I'll show you no no they are thicker
that's it yeah I mean there's a
subsistence right that's like I like it
good is it away it's not as bad in the
other generic we do not saw download you
can still go to toilet and white guitar
and you're not sort but you want to be
able to sit on the bed for longer and
you only need beads for like a couple
days and then you can move to the
regular one strip that's why you need
the bigger pants so it will go over
where my office is
and it will fit a big high right I think
that's because I'm hearing that way that
way so one thing I really really
remember in hospital is looking around
bare feet hopefully great I'm addressing
one of the cleanest places but do you
want to bet
no say that I never took these last time
but flip-flops you don't need this it's
going to say it better last time like
eclipses it is so hot and Russell and a
reparative ward is high up and it's
really hard because they want to keep
the babies warm so you don't need
surface clean after you've just watched
our way best thing ever so I just got my
normal Hutchison how do I have yarn I'll
be honest they're just not going to want
to clean the skin the way you usually
clean is compare evaluative of
immaterial obviously very illegal to but
I wouldn't I don't think your I'll have
the time I'm going to try and breastfeed
like I say I'm going to probably have my
mom my sisters and everyone coming to
meet this baby I just want to pick
quickly Joaquin but I'm allowing myself
get off make sure no I think I think I
think is actually fine in this situation
but these ones I find a lot of us
because they are they're quite wet and I
think this green ones are quite job oh
yeah I loved apply a derma wand but
people know like so all of a balancing
one and twenty days Wednesday hmm
I'm definitely going to want to be nice
and moisturized after and this is my
absolute fave Eucerin q10 active Jojo
gets pretty bad eczema by the way so
when she recommending about this there I
feel like I've tried so many different
ones responds kept my skin completely
red free itch free just lovely
absolutely love it and in my little bag
of goodies the more essentials so again
you know after it not having a period
for nine months it's quite a shock
doesn't employ toilet tissue uses but
also like feels lighter then I dried my
toilet paper on a very light just
quickly on freshener I get that so yeah
so that's gonna make me feel so much
better
me being me and being weird I probably
recommend getting slightly more expense
one gain ones that like pH balance if
you're going to you know well I've
actually might change this was I had to
get this on the way for video so I
wanted to show you that I'm being
probably good for like the forty if
you're going to use it down there yeah
now I probably would as a theorem it's
really hot in those hospitals one thing
I really really remember from first time
is my lips are so dry so I've come to
this one which is another one I like
this one
ultimately it it feels nice I don't have
to use my fingers and I think I do you
think we have to just fingers
potentially going down the coastal route
so I like that also I thought I might
not feel a bit grimy at times this is my
absolute fave thing ever for someone who
suffers from extra and can't use the gel
and the hand sanitizer gift is amazing
and it smells amazing it's the organic
different hand sprayed by Nia yard okay
and literally all you need and it's mmm
so nice like instantly it would make you
feel really fresh and clean it smells
nice this is again favorite at night you
might give it to me you just gone
through so much you're over here and
it's come out a bundle is crazy not
where your pillow with that it's the
this work sleep Club pillow spray and
all the smells to love I'm doing
everything and just make you feel really
like which I use at home so I imagine I
Eve I don't know you feel like you're at
home
yeah it's lucky you know it's not like
you're going to go to bed at 10 o'clock
and wake up the next day at 7:00 or not
when you have a baby so this will make
you feel like the night aren't as
painful as a little shocking is there
some other things and after an operation
in fact after any else is just a regular
childbirth your body has gone through
something massive it's never experienced
before even if it has that arms habit
really goes to like internal healing and
bruising everything just one of them
Michigan I love homeopathic Annika it
leaves a slight that's handy and I
thought this time round I might need
some of this for the realization
unannounced reaching the girls so I've
got the usual things as well like if I
get hot or my hair so it just looks
awful and let's be honest I'm not gonna
have time to do my hair and I'm glad
Ygritte and some likely staple hair
better than one that is a so much
pressure on that one hair bow to be
found a lovely I've got two sisters I
can say quick where we go I have like
five on my wrist that's like the one
thing only my hair at my face at all
time and my own toothpaste
I forgot on my to wash at home I will be
bringing it to those with ropes I
watched other people thank you very
lovely briefs and I'm gonna recommend
and up Sylvania great check out her
channel she has said that this is really
great for when your nipple muscle so I
mean it's an amazing thing that you can
make milk right but obviously a baby has
to suck quite hard so it's going to fit
your business school and everyone
tell me that this really really helps to
cracking and stop bleeding and
apparently you should choose it before
as well collect customs them off of it
we try oh my god I watch too much
YouTube again there's a senator and the
other thing which we recommended and I
went straight out and walk because I
think this is brilliant of all the
things maternity I wanted to buy this is
just as one and it's the Jojo mama baby
two packs of policing rods even if
you're not breastfeeding your boobs are
massive after you make baby and it's not
comfortable to sleep without a bra but
you all said I want to eat with a
regular bra because you get you know
that you have two bits in the world this
doesn't have the the bits
let's stop underline is that it minds
not my size bra and I'm a training bra
um used to be port this time I went
today only brought in for the cilantro
so look it's literally popped up base
nice so over the head there's no there's
no class at the back there's no class at
the top and I imagine you know again if
you're breastfeeding you can wear this
at night just for comfort stick a pardon
and feel great Maliki and then just you
know quickly but if you have to it's
like the best working from home Brian
Massey is great right yeah actually I
find it quite comfortable to sleep that
have something holding them at the
moment because they're yeah alright so
that's me
so you know regular fat but you get in
the pool with a baby conga amazing
c-section bit more complicated but still
fine or rotating a little bit more
traumatic either way we're all human
it's all going to come out what we need
after it's in chocolate oh great like
fruit yeah we want chocolate and one
thing I heard from first time round in
28 Halle Berry is they bring you a
beautiful toast I'm not even the likes
of of tea I think Holly had Sauron I the
groceries cost if you're a cup of tea
because there's no one not still could
give her a cup of tea like you should
that maybe daddy is something sweet
other mums always a winner right this is
for when the guests come fetch a gun if
your husband's there with Liam he's been
through as well he's tired and remember
he hasn't had nine months of a baby
kicking you and keeping you up at night
he's just a comment
for some homes we've had a few months to
do with it a little sugar so now I'm and
I love just one because you get the
strike the stick you know yeah what
isn't right was in funny sorry Ryan
fainted first time he did string let's
move on to baby wait you want to tell
them what you having
okay so I know how many more I'm the
most important impatient person in the
world
earlier every time about a baby at 12
weeks I've asked most people don't ask
because you went to wait for 20 weeks
when it's official until it's very clear
with the world girl but I twelve week I
are and these times it's all really time
if you're right so so she's got boys
girl and now in another thought is
another boy but we're not into like
gendered colors in the family informal
honey if you're obsessive tink but so in
babies are first war and you're even if
when you're in this boiling hot hospital
we have to wear hat also contra and
actually this is a two-part from baby up
and it's really good value hopefully you
need because they're only going to wear
these little hats for three four days
whatever time here when a baby's born
they have to wear vest and then a baby
growth so I've got three over weight how
to out sign my babies have weighed 74
613 and then listing answer is six weeks
if I assume it's going to be somewhere
in between so under the law I don't
remember any of the kids being this
little this one says up to seven and a
half pounds so let's hope it's not
bigger than those people because I live
do not benefit and then on top you have
a baby bro so again I've gone for free
looking that'd be enough
so I've gone to next and next to the
most gorgeous range from your baby's
growth they're quite pricey but for the
first one they're really soft really
nice yeah unlike make a bit good kids
clothes and junk yeah you can get a pack
again of like four which is actually
really good value to go to the back so
this one's my favorites I think as to be
the first one that's officially oh you
don't like that hope them have really
long legs might remember was only having
to cut the feet off because we did have
really non there yes I like wash them
before yeah I have while for rigid again
and there's a couple of Muslims and
these ones are just in this one and bomb
will be the thing that aid in MMA I love
there's many Muslims are so lucky and
they're so big but you can use it as a
blanket so if your baby wants this straw
dog and it's summer so I'm having mine
mid-may so it might be warm so it might
not want to read thick blanket you can
use that sort of cloth also handy for
the auntie if you want to cuddle and
don't want to ruin their whistles John
be a Superman the other favorite to have
to buy on groups kind of made it a bit
real I was leaving a long time
nothing I have to fight is brew my own
the villain on how this means for years
earth lucky they have black - it's like
toss - Keys growth and yes they tell you
use water and cooking water I'm hurtin
trying to clean black lolly - what's a
baby with piece of cotton wool is quite
tricky but they do have these now they
never had first a second line now
there's a water wipes and they are pure
water baby boy chemical free yes nothing
in it so that's good but good I remember
seeing you guys with is bold water in
the custom on balls and just it's such a
fast yeah so just going to go straight
to light I got a massive practices
Anderson's done stories not going to
make me so that's right and my massive
tips for new mums just before you think
you gonna go into labor like let's say
38 weeks maybe go and have a pedicure
because when you're in labor or after
he's had to baby if you look down at
your feet and they look happy you're
going to feel so much better and good
tips so yeah so don't treat yourself
suppose your services I'll tell for some
of you guys I definitely I mean I don't
need to learn any more about what it's
like to have a baby
seriously I think I've got heard enough
info by now today you guys so much for
watching I'll let you know she has a
baby today and I'll see you guys in the
next video
