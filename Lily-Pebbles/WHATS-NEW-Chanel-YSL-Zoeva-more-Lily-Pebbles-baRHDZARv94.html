talking to you guys about new in beauty
launches so let me start with some new
stuff from Real Techniques they put out
new collections or whole new range of
brushes I'm going to put all the info
for all these products in the
description box so that anything I say
that's wrong you can go and check the
details there the range is called the
multi pet collection and I've got
quietly brushes here to show you so I'm
going to quickly skim through them the
point triple-xl
so this is like a massive brush they're
so so soft
although brushing and synthetic but
seriously soft and is it real with the
white and black tip there's also a new
sponge and you guys know I love the
orange like complexion sponge this one
is black and it looks much smaller it
also comes with a little stand which i
think is so clever I put a little like
ring tray that I put my sponges in but
having a little stand come with the
sponge is kind of genius this one's a
little smaller if you probably use it
for like a cream blush or bronzer this
is the cheapest product in the range and
it's ten pounds then there's a couple of
individual brushes the large and
extra-large to see an idea of pricing
the large one is 16 pounds it's kind of
like the mid price point for this new
collection and they're really big fluffy
brushes I really like the handle I say
let me take one out for you so they're
really really sleek I love how they kind
of taper off at the top they've got this
cool angular bit bottom with a little
play button really really soft these
would be great like any powder product
and the final thing from that collection
is the set which is the most expensive
thing this set is 30 pounds it includes
the small extra small double extra small
and triple extra small brush so these
are pretty much all I brushes I reckon
you can use these twos for concealer as
well these two of them great size for
eyes again
primal to use you could use them for a
face or for eyes these looks great I
really can't wait to try them I think
that's big one will be so good for
buffing out concealer and it comes with
a stand again I just met such a nice
like extra detail but then I want to
talk about our from stealer and I know a
lot of people have been talking about
these but they are great so thereby
stealer and they're called the
Magnificent metals glitter and glow I've
only got two shades here there is a rose
gold shade that I am desperate to try
but here I've got kitten karma
and molten midnight so these are
basically liquid sister I thought
usually with these products you try them
out and it's just like chanted glitter
and it gets all over my cheeks and it's
so messy and I'm just like no but these
are genius there are eight shades
available and they're 23 pounds each
which is pricey but I think they're
worth it because they are great they
come in is really easy a little tube it
looks a bit like a lip gloss and it's
incredibly glittery but it's water-based
so it applies so smooth you can
literally spread it over your whole lid
and then I even took a brush and try to
blend out and there was no fallout and
no glitter anywhere it's just like solid
glitter that isn't chunky doesn't fall
anywhere and this shade in particular is
beautiful as kitten one it's kind of
like a golden peach this other one I
have here is like a black with silver
glitter so it's definitely for the more
daring but very cool for an evening look
I just think if you want to try out
glitter this is probably the easiest way
to do it because I find like loose
glitter is just impossible and other
products I've tried have been really
hard to apply next up is a palette from
Zoe that I love Zoe the cosmetics this
is their matte eyeshadow palette and you
guys know I love them that eyeshadow
palette look at this oh my god it is
beautiful it's 17 pound 50 so it's
cheaper they're like an urban decay
palette but more expensive than a
drugstore palette it kind of sits
somewhere in between and I was really
kind of intrigued by the palette I don't
I wouldn't say I love these two shades
this one I was probably use for
everything else I love today on my eyes
I am wearing I can't read any of these
shade name I've really bad I sat in the
front is really hard to read I'm wearing
this one all over the lid with a bit of
this one a bit of this one had a bit of
that one
so I'll insert a clip now of me applying
the eyeshadows and they're such good
quality if anything they're maybe a
little bit too big vented I always like
to tap off the excess before I apply it
because they give such strong color
payoff and I love how this palette has
some really nice orange shades in it
it's definitely a massive trend for its
spring summer a lot of the eyeshadow
palettes I see coming out have these
oranges in it and I think it can be
quite scary to wear orange on the eyelid
but orange isn't that different to brown
really it's in the same kind of color
family and if you know how to apply it
quite easy to work with I like to just
put a little bit in really blend it out
and then put a bit of brown in the
crease just to kind of make it look a
bit more wearable and I love that kind
of like sunset eyelids eyeshadow look I
think it's so pretty
I really like the eyeshadow that I have
on today I just got this brown eyeliner
and lots of mascara I will talk about in
a minute but what a gorgeous eyeshadow
palette ok let's talk about this launch
because I am NOT a massive fan of this
next one it's by benefit and benefit
it's such a strange brand to me there's
some products I absolutely love I just
need the marketing in general and the
kind of strategy of the brand is a
little bit strange they always seem to
try and like solve a problem which I
guess is a good thing but sometimes I
feel like they're trying to solve a
problem that isn't really there this
launch is to products and it's part of
the their real collection and it's got
the Douro shadow blender and the double
the lip so let's talk about the
eyeshadows first there are 8 shades of
these and I think they're 19 pound 50 so
let's princes they'd look like this it's
a little duo eyeshadow I don't really
mind the packaging is quite easy to
throw out your makeup eyes so you open
it up and what it is is a little eye
shadow duo there's a mirror in there
which is great and then an eye shadow
which is split into horizontally all the
eyeshadows are pretty shimmery if I
remember correctly and it comes with
this little foam applicator so you hold
it like that
and the idea is that you swipe it on the
products and then apply it on your lid
and it will give you that kind of shaded
crease and lighter lid look it doesn't
work like it just doesn't work for me
you end up with this kind of awful
strike and then you have to blend it out
and then the time you spend blending you
might as well have just put on a base
shadow and put on crease shadow I think
it's a little bit like not offensive but
I think people know how to apply a light
color and then a crease color I don't
think this is going to help anything and
I get what they were trying to get up
but for me this just doesn't work
sorry the next product that kind of
launched with that was the varial double
the lip and this is a lipstick problem
solver and similar idea there's two
shades in the lipstick one darker and
one lighter and when you apply it
meant to apply the darker shade around
the edge again I just don't really get
the point when you apply this it's very
harsh and it's very kind of like that
90s look of a road dark lip liner if you
blend it out it looks nice and like
ombre but um braids you know I mean like
darker and then lighter in the middle
and the colors are a bit strange that
they picked for the collection as well I
just don't think the sort of curve is
necessary I don't think it's needed I
guess it's good that they're trying to
do different things but this launched
unfortunately wasn't for me the double
the lips also come in eight shades and
they are sixteen pounds fifty I've got a
couple of new launches from Chanel to
show you the first one is Foundation and
I love Chanel foundations this is the
little ultra too new and I use the shade
20 I'm pretty sure this foundation is
meant to appeal to active women this is
kind of the pitch that they're going for
women who expect that foundation to last
from morning to evening but look great
on the skin and be skin like and not be
heavy and if there's ultra wear flawless
foundation it is 37 pounds and it comes
in a huge shade range I can't remember
exactly how many but I'm pretty sure
there's a really large collection of
shades to pick from now as I said I love
Chanel foundations and I wanted to love
this I love the idea of it I'll insert
the clip now of me applying it and as
long as a couple of times before and I
haven't really had a strong opinion
about it but actually this time when
applying it on camera and seeing it with
the studio light I could really see how
much this has clung to my skin I have
dry dehydrated skin I mean normal to
dehydrated actually and at the moment
it's quite spotty so sue shares not the
best representation of my skin I found
that this really clung around my nose
and it looked heavy on my skin and
unfortunately I don't know I really
wanted to like it but it just felt too
heavy and dry and I don't like to see my
foundation I had to spray on a lot of
kind of mist afterwards to make my skin
look glowy again I did apply it with a
wet sponge which should have helped but
I don't know why this just didn't really
work for me I will try again with my
skin's in a better condition but for now
I'm not sure with my favorite Chanel
foundation I really like the vital
Lumiere aqua Chanel have also lost their
spring summer 2017 collection which is
gorgeous I've got the whole collection
in here
and I'm not going to go through like
each individual thing because there's
loads the reason I wanted to talk about
this collection because I think it's
really clever and I really liked the
idea of it
Lucia pika I don't know that they plan
to name she's like the global creative
director of Chanel beauty now and I
really like the direction she's taking
chanel beauty in it definitely a bit
more daring a bit more exciting less
classic but still keeping within the
whole Chanel theme this collection is
called color codes and it's all about
the classic Chanel colors that Coco
Chanel herself was really into did I say
it's called color codes or Coco codes
British or called Coco codes so the five
iconic color codes they picked for this
are red black gold white and beige and
you can see on this little bit of paper
that it's like they're using the colors
as a code for the whole collection which
I really just like the idea of that and
I like all those colors as well together
so there's lots of different products
there are a few different nail polishes
there's like a blonde right a beige
black metamorphoses a Rouge red the
Chanel collection is always really big
there's a couple of lipsticks and
eyeliners the three standout products
are always the palette so let me quickly
show you those this is the eyeshadow
quad and it's very pretty so there's two
quite some of the gold colors actually a
brown and then a really pale gold the
Chanel quads are always really really
pretty
there's also a blusher that I think will
do really well called elegant it's quite
shimmery but it's really pretty pinky
beige with a bit of gold in it that's I
think that's really nice actually I
haven't actually used that yeah my
cheeks I just kind of watched it on my
hand and then the standout products is
definitely going to be the blush harmony
so this is the Coco code like big
standout product from the collection
it's like a blusher quad it's got this
kind of white highlight shade a tan
bronzer a gold highlight and a quite
ready pink blush I don't really know how
to first use this in the cutaway which
is an insert now I switched kind of
three bottom right colors together and
applied it to the high points of my
cheek and it's really nice but I find
that this pink red color is really
strong so you kind of have to be care
always you end up with really red cheeks
but maybe you're supposed to use these
individually but they're no quite small
either way it's definitely like a
collection piece it's absolutely
gorgeous if you're really into
collecting Chanel makeup this is
definitely one to pick up and the tones
are really nice you could probably use
those to its eyeshadows as well this
next launch I am so excited for because
I massively changed my mind about it the
white company is one of my favorite
shops ever for like home decor and
candles and lovely homey smelly
sometimes I just go and hang out in
there because it just smells so good I
got sent then use skincare brains and I
haven't heard that they were doing a
screen hair in so when it arrived I was
a bit judgmental about it I just hate
when brands try and do something that
they're not expert in and they just do
it badly so a little bit skeptical at
first but then I pretty quickly realized
that the white company created the
skincare range in collaboration with DES
ium which is a very well-respected brand
within the beauty industry for skincare
it also took me a year to develop these
products so I actually think they worked
really hard on it they've created a
small edit of products they haven't gone
crazy with a huge collection and when I
started trying them out I actually
thought wow this is really great so I'm
really excited for this I'm really happy
for the brands that they've created this
and it's done so well
well I think it will do so well there
are six products in the range and they
range from the price point of 20 pounds
to 40 pounds it's not crazy expensive
and we quickly go through the products
there is a super serum which is the most
expensive one I really like this
actually it's a very hydrating serum it
comes in very easy to use like dropping
applicator there is a nice oil I love
using oils in the evening so I'm really
glad they've got that in the collection
also very nice I haven't really used any
of these a lot yet I just tried them but
I revised is an eye serum I think I
remember that being really refreshing
under the eye there is an advanced
hydration moisturizer pretty standard
moisturizer and then the standout
product for me is certainly the super
bomb this is their cleanser first of all
I love that it comes in a tube like this
so much easier than having it in the tub
it comes out like a creamy gel and then
when you rub it into the skin it turns
into more like a bomb like an oil and
it's so good it's so
taking us a makeup makes the skin feel
really hydrated I think this is going to
definitely be the bestseller from the
range and I would really recommend
trying it okay finally the last one is a
new mascara from YSL I absolutely love
YSL mascara so I really wanted to try
this it's called the shock and quite
different packaging for them and it
should be served like the shock and then
it's got pink on the lid and the writing
it's 23 pounds and I think it's a great
mascara it's very similar to the
Charlotte Tilbury legendary lashes but I
don't think it will come off like the
Charlotte Tilbury mascara is if you've
got oily lids they really do go
everywhere and even with me I sometimes
get a bit mascara here and I have to
wipe it and then it stays but this one
is a bit more long-lasting a very
similar finish and it just gives really
huge lashes thick long black eyelashes
I'm wearing it now and I really like it
and I'm definitely going to continue
using this so those some of the new
beauty launches out at the moment I hope
