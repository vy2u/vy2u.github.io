good morning everyone today it is
Saturday I'm sorry to start this vlog
out on a bit of a negative note but I
haven't had the best week the week
started off aright I was being so
productive
Monday and Tuesday I was working on this
video if you follow me on snapchat you
would have seen it's on a makeup bag
video but coming at the end of the month
I spent two solid days filming and
editing it and I'm so happy with it so
it felt great and then on Wednesday I
got sick I won't bore you with the
details but I've certainly last three
days feeling really crap not being able
to move from the sofa and because of
what I had and like being on antibiotics
and stuff I kind of I think I like fell
asleep on the sofa and had a nap and and
I woke up with the worst neck pain and
then that made everything worse and that
gave me a headache
and I've kind of just been falling apart
over the past few days so that is the
only problem when you kind of dedicate
one vlog a week normally there's at
least one interesting day for me to vlog
but this week there hasn't been because
my interesting day was supposed to be
Thursday and I had to cancel everything
I did end up going to the preview of
lala land and it was like a screening at
Hannah old hotel and Ryan Gosling and
Emma Stone were actually there and it
was a really fun night but it literally
like when I came back got back into her
pajamas and so rubbish again so I
haven't really got anything to vlog
because I haven't done anything a week
and as we can we have zero plans so I'm
going to attempt to vlog today but just
a little disclaimer I have no plans I
have no idea what I'm doing today but
just woken up and had hair wash they
better tell you what I thought of lala
land I want to give it an honest review
first of all this film is far too hyped
up but that's not their fault I think
that just happens and I always feel like
when I films really hyped up you're kind
of setting yourself up for a few people
to be disappointed so that's thanks bear
in mind I think it was kind of more
hyped up than it maybe as worse I do
think they deserve all the awards they
won because it's just really different
it's like a really old-fashioned musical
but with a really modern feel to it I
don't really know how they got the
modern old fashioned thing but they
nailed it
the house scenery in cinematography and
colors and
the editing style was all great I
completely understand why they cast Ryan
Gosling and Emma Stone together because
their chemistry is amazing and I love
them both as actors
Ryan Gosling was incredible at learning
the piano for the role and I also think
he's a really good singer dancer Emma
Stone as much they love her as an
actress I don't think she's that strong
of a singer or dancer so for me that was
a little bit kind of off-putting because
every time she sang it just like
reminded me that she's not really a
singer that was kind of the only
negative I thought about the kind of
casting I really love all the songs and
I love the storyline I agree I've seen
some people say that there were a few
parts in the film where it dragged a
little bit and I do agree with that but
I think the second half was incredible
and it really picks up towards the end
so that's kind of my review I love LA
makes me excited to go back okay I need
to eat some breakfast this is the only
problem with being on antibiotics I have
to eat before I take these ones and you
guys know I hate eating breakfast so I'm
going to announcer force feed myself the
chat you in a bit
I've just been straightening my hair and
watching say yes the dress which was
definitely my guilty pleasure we are now
going to go to Primrose Hill and then
we're going to meet my parents in a pub
and have some lunch I really want some
soup so that it'll make me feel better
and rich ran to my parents this morning
pretty far how many miles would you say

to get my mum's car because we're going
to borrow it this weekend
