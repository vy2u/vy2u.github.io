good morning everyone today is Tuesday
the 20th of December we are getting very
close to Christmas Day exciting stuff
this is actually probably the first day
that I've noticed most people are out of
office
I feel like yesterday Friday was
probably a lot of people's last day but
then yesterday a few people like we're
still in the office doing some stuff and
then today it's very quiet it's nice to
me because my inbox is kind of empty no
one's emailing me normally I get like
hundreds of emails a day but also it's
quite frustrating because I'm kind of
still working but no one's getting back
to me on anything so I'm kind of forcing
myself to have a day not working today I
feel like this is probably my last
opportunity to get Christmas presents
sorted I feel like I'm pretty much
sorted but I've got a few extra things
that I want to get rich because I
wrapped all his presence yesterday and
put them in the stocking and then I
could kind of see how full or not full
it was and I laid out the presents to
see like waters missing it was actually
about to get him an Xbox game and I
thought this is the perfect present to
just like finish off his stocking I was
ready to go eat today and randomly last
night he said to me can you go to August
to pick something up for me because I've
ordered myself an xbox game for
Christmas I was like what and it was
exactly what I was gonna get him so he's
already bought that for himself so I
don't know he kind of wants clothes or
trainers but trainers is a bit
extravagant for a stocking I'm gonna go
have a look I also need to get a couple
of bits of my mom and I just feel like
this is gonna be the last day that I'm
probably near shops before Christmas
because I just want to start kind of not
going near shops and stuff so that is my
plan for this morning I'm gonna go to
next to get something and then I think
I'm meeting up with my mom and sister
and Grandma I haven't seen my grandma in
awhile that makes me sad so I'm gonna go
see her I think we're gonna have lunch I
need to find an urban outfitters but
they're all in town and I don't notice
town because I feel like when it's this
busy I get a little bit nervous going
into like central London especially
after the awful news of what happened in
Berlin yesterday so I'm gonna try and
find the most local urban outfitters
that I can serve vlogmas is nearly
coming to an end which is very sad I've
really enjoyed it this year a lot of you
guys have commented saying that you like
the way I've done it this year which
basically
means I've had like one or two days off
a week and yeah I agree I think it's
really kind of made it less like I'm
forced to do a video this week might be
quite hard content-wise I have no plans
so trying to like find things to vlog is
a little bit harder but I know you guys
don't mind the boring vlogs so I'm gonna
get on my day and head to NEX come to
Gales to meet my grandma my auntie my
mom my sister and my cousin runs off
work it's great it was I'm here with Jo
Jo look at her pregnant coming
well that's pushy just in Waitrose
helping my grandma do some food shopping
it'll be here just had a really weird
experience with my courtesy car and the
alarm just wouldn't stop going off like
I was driving it and the alarm was going
off and then I tried looking it and
unlocking it and I looked like crazy
person that didn't know how to use my
car which is correct I don't know how to
use this car but there's definitely some
kind of fault with it I had to bring my
brother in or like hell I've got an
anthropology voucher so I'm quickly
gonna pop in and see if there's anything
in there I'm gonna get this handle for a
cupboard I have in my office that hasn't
had a handle for a year I'm also going
to get this really cute elk earring that
means it's really pretty I added to the
L key ring on I think that's pretty
sweet
I'm gonna reprint the photos from
yesterday I've picked a different photo
that should work at this time okay
boots is so much better than sample
snacks so far
ripped some boxes from Levi's because we
going on about loving their boxes
sorry I haven't blogged much but I will
do a haul for you guys when I get home
hey that was a really productive
shopping trip I got something from rich
I got some wrappings and like ribbon and
some more wrapping paper I got some
pajamas they're not the ones I want I've
been looking everywhere for some wrecked
some wrecked some read checked festive
pajamas I saw an M&amp;amp;S they had some when
I went and still they didn't have my
size and then no one else has any like
festive pajamas I reckon because it's
like so near to Christmas now they just
want to get rid of all their stock and
everything sold out I found some in
Phoenix they're not quite as red as I
would hoped and they're a bit thin so
they're more like thin orange checked
pajamas but they're kind of festive
enough so I want to wear those on
Christmas morning and in the evening
else that I get well I'll show you when
I get home I'll do a little quick call
for you guys I'm gonna drive back now 24
o'clock god it feels like it's so late
I'm back home now and I think I had a
pretty successful shopping day it's now
half four so I've got enough time to
hopefully wrap presents before rich gets
back from work I think he's going to the
gym anyway I've just kind of put the
Christmas lights on I've lit this little
dip teak candle smells really really
nice I'm trying to get into the festive
mood I've got a film on I thought I
could show you guys what I picked up at
the shops I got some more wrapping paper
this one it's from Paper Chase I know
it's not this one's from Waitrose and
it's brown paper so all the presents
I've already wrapped up just plain brown
paper
this one's brown with like a white
pattern on and I might rewrap a couple
of presents I know that's really Layton
but I'm not happy with some of my
presents and I like to make an effort I
also got some other stuff and Paper
Chase to kind of make my presents look
prettier from Paper Chase
I had a huge variety I got a whole bunch
I've been organizing my office and just
sorting out all my loose papers and
stuff which is why I also got loads of
folders at the moment I've got two big
like lever arch files like a black one
and a white one but they just look so
like Officine I thought these were so
pretty I don't know if you can see the
print it's not really picking up on
camera but it's white with this gold
like geometric print on it and I
love it so they're much slimmer which is
why I got four so hopefully I can kind
of split things from that home work car
I don't know I just thought four of
those kind of lined up on my shelf would
look much nicer than white but now I got
some present toppers not many because I
only want to use them on a special like
big presents these from Paper Chase the
little red ribbon with a kind of fake
candy cane thing and I got four of those
to make my presents look a bit more
special I also bought some red ribbon
this is like curling ribbon because I've
got gold and I thought the red would
look really nice with it okay that's
everything from Paper Chase put a flag
here from next as well that's riches
bloody video game he bought himself oh
no I don't want to show these things
because there's some stuff for my mom
and stuff for my nephew and I don't want
to ruin the surprise so I've got some
sellotape from Poundland all that for a
pound I told you guys that I bought rich
some underwear from Levi's I don't know
why he like really like Levi's underwear
so round him doesn't buy his jeans from
there so I got him some stripey
underwear and I got him some blue ones I
don't know anything about boxes rich has
a Christmas party work tomorrow and the
theme is black and gold so I picked up
this t-shirt for him I did ask if it was
perfect
he was pretty excited about that I
showed you what I got from Anthropologie
and then I also found these pajamas
in Phoenix so I told you they're not
quite red enough and they're also quite
thin they're not as cozy as their M&amp;amp;S or
others but they will do so these are
probably for my Christmas pajamas this
year so prettily wrapped up every time I
bought so today they were like is this a
present and I was like no it's for
myself right I'm gonna get on with some
wrapping well I wonder if I can put this
on myself this is the handle for my
office cupboard
I think this is so pretty I really
really like it let's see if I can do
this without Rich's help this is the
cupboard this is the hole II hmm all
right let's see I might just put you
guys down who needs men hey I could be a
single woman look at that dah dah
finally my cupboard has a handle I'm so
happy I'm gonna wrap some presents I've
also got this washi tape that I just had
in my collection and I thought that I'd
be really pretty I'm gonna have some of
this as well this is big Tom it's my
absolute favorite tomato juice I
actually don't like any other tomato
juice it's pre spiced and it's
absolutely delicious gloss by the way
guys
look my lips are better after three
months think I've cured it Bioderma lip
balm it's incredible and for the cracks
there's still a little bit chapped on
the edges but I use that 0.1 percent
hydrocortisone which is not recommended
to use on lips so don't take my word for
it but I just used it three times a very
very small amount and I think my lips
are better but I'm gutted because I've
already filmed my new year's resolution
video which is going up on the 1st of
January and my lips look so bad in the
video I literally look a crazy person so
when you watch that I mean I'm sure
there's still be so many comments like
your lips like awful but just know it
was when they were awful and they're
better now but I've already pre filmed
that video because I don't want to have
to film on Year's Day oh my god guys
look what I just got then I'm literally
touching it like a baby I have always
always wanted one of these oh my god the
lovely people at dippity accept me a
huge bay and it's not just any Bay it's
like some kind of Christmas special Bay
there has like festive packaging with
these like cute little stars on it oh my
god it's so heavy
it's a giant Condor the actual candle is
black I literally I'm not putting this
down I'm hugging it
forever I love it oh this is epic I am
so happy thank you so much
diptych team this wrapping paper from
Paper Chase is genius
look there's grid lines on the inside so
you know you're cutting straight oh my
god that's so clever yes I am so much
happier with that looks like what the
gold ribbon and the red and then I've
got my little gift tags which are from
Kiki K and then this from Paper Chase
now that looks like a special present
grandma Christmas present attempt number
two I really like this for it so we're
just about to walk back down the aisle
I'm laughing my head off also I like
this one because so I'm gonna give this
to both grandparents for riches side
it's got like witches sister and which
is mom and in which is grandpa and it
also has my mom and my grandma in the
background so it's kind of got a bit of
everyone and we just look really happy
oh my Amazon order just came and I'm
very excited for this it is a very geeky
purchase that is much needed in this
flat it is Oh God so much packaging away
oh my god
some cycling Ben gets so full a box in a
box if you follow me on Twitter you
might know what this is it's upside down
it's a shredder I told you guys I was
clearing out my office a bit and trying
to get organized and I'm just so bored
of like tearing up bank statements my
bank won't let me go paperless I don't
know it's really complicated I won't
bore you with it so I get statements
every month and I don't think I need to
keep them I like to be digital which
means I need to shred them every month
so I'm very excited to have the shredder
I don't know where we're gonna keep it
hopefully I'll find somewhere to hide it
that was actually really enjoyable I'm
just sorting out my folders now and they
actually come with these really that's
what the inside of folders really put
see and they come with these dividers as
well that are really nice I'm gonna make
little labels for the side of my folders
yes I labeled my label maker I've had
this for ages this was 8 pounds and I
got it from Amazon I don't even know I
think it's dying yes time eh it's pretty
crappy to be honest it breaks all the
time but it was cheap and it does the
trick most the time so I'm just gonna
make a label that says like home and put
it on the side of this folder so I know
this is sort of like home stuff it's all
like boring paperwork for sofas and TVs
and stuff I'm gonna pause what I'm doing
because I need to go and make dinner I
haven't finished the filing yet but
looking nice so far I'm gonna line them
up here put like car health home I have
two more here which is not gonna be
happy with all of this recycling it's
just got home and I remembered that I
haven't blogged in a little while so I
just be making tomato sauce to really
like basic basically chopped onions
garlic and chopped tomatoes all in there
and I'm making it with some spot
spaghetti and I just realized that we
are running low luckily I have a million
backup it is our last backup pack
panic we so much pasta so I'm just gonna
put this in the kiln the jar and then we
must buy some more guys look what just
came in the post Merry Christmas from
the high runes our Christmas card from
Caroline and the farm love that they
have like personalized Christmas cards I
don't even send Christmas cards I'm
terrible person but this is very sweet
Thank You Caroline sorted out all my
folders so I've got four folders there I
think they look really nice I'm in
serious office organizing mode I'm just
like filing and clearing and sorting and
I'm never like this but this time of
year I always get better like this
because I think I get a bit nervous
that January is gonna come around and
I'll just want to kind of get on with
work and I'll feel like I want to do
this but I won't be motivated and
whereas now for some reason I feel
really motivated to get ready for
January so I'm just going with it
because this feeling doesn't come very
often so I'm like full-on tidying office
and sorting and I'm loving it got a
couple of pads of paper there that I
like to use to excreme' Lynne and not be
neat in my ruler I hope my thinking
cards this is from all over bonus as
well I've cleared this out so I only
have what I actually use in it and
everything else is stored away for when
these pens run out I have my bullet
journal and this new little notebook
which has LP on it I have to figure out
what I'm using that one for I'm now
going to sort out this which is just
where I shop or my stationery stuff and
like clearly there's not gonna close so
I need to kind of go through and sort
out what is in here I have like
calligraphy stuff in here as well
I just start with everything I'm now
sorting through all my external hard
drives and labeling them depending on
what's honest on them
Hannah's driving around and I think
we're gonna go to the pub because she is
gonna be out of London and I won't see
you for a while so we're gonna have a
little festive drink together and catch
up these are my glasses from Bailey
Nelson but this glasses case just does
not look pretty on my desk I don't know
is there such a thing of a pretty
glasses case but there is if anyone
knows of any pretty way to display your
glasses on your desk when you're not
wearing them let me know this little
corner is pleasing me greatly I don't
love this cup but

had a mulled wine and now I'm back I
didn't blog any of it but me and Hannah
were just catching up and then rich
