happy Sunday to everyone today I'm in a
bit of a different location I'm actually
sitting on my bed and let me just tell
you it is so comfortable I think I have
to film all my future videos here so me
and rich moved into our flat in I think
it was August and I haven't really shown
you around much I'm not going to do like
a flat tour but I do really want to kind
of show you bits and bobs around the
flat and I've just been putting it off
for so long because I feel like nothing
is really finished but then I came to
the realization that I don't think
anything will really feel finished and I
like that I like there's always things
we can improve on and add if everything
was just done I feel like I'd be bored
and I'd want to move again so I thought
I'm just gonna start showing you around
and some bits are gonna be unfinished
I'm sure things are gonna change as we
live here the next few years but I'm
just going to start anyway and I thought
I would start with a wardrobe tool I did
one of these like three years ago it's
the most embarrassing video ever but I
haven't done an updated one since now
our flat is pretty small and we didn't
have much choice of where our bedroom
was gonna go and I actually do really
like our room it's kind of a square
shape and you walk down a few steps to
get into it which I quite likes it feels
like a bit hidden at the back but the
first thing we both noticed when we
looked at the flat was there really
wasn't an obvious space for a wardrobe
and it was a bit of a worry of mine but
we love the flats so much that we
thought we'll just deal with it when we
move in so we've had to be quite
creative about how we store our clothes
and we have a really small flat so
you've had to be creative anyway with
storage there's like no cupboards or
storage anywhere so I thought I just
talked through where we store all our
clothes and how and the first thing that
we bought for our bedroom that was so
super important is a bed that lifts up
with storage underneath this one is a
half ottoman I'll put the link to the
bed below I absolutely love it they do
ones with a whole bed lifts up but I
thought there's a bit of a faff and I
actually don't think our ceiling is high
enough to take it and also I have a bit
of a bad back so we got one that has
half ottoman half lifts up the bottom
it's really easy to lift and I was so
surprised at how much space is
underneath the bed it is huge so we
store under there our shoes I have these
little IKEA boxes and I've actually
taken polaroid photos of the shoes so I
know which is in each box and then we
store like winter clothes bits and bobs
if you kind of want to
out the way it's a real mess at the
moment that's something that we really
need to sort out but at the moment I've
got like summer clothes in there I've
got some travel bits rich has like Xbox
things in there that's basically our
version of an attic it's small but it's
amazing just for putting stuff away out
of sight we also have a chest of drawers
and I really wanted like a really pretty
one I was looking for ages but in the
end we decided to get shutters in our
lounge and they are a fortune so we
decided to save on things like drawers
because these ones are from Ikea and I
think they're absolutely fine we did
have problems leveling it out because
flats in London if you live in London
you'll know they're hardly ever flat
they're all like on a hill so we had to
level it out but I really like it i
bought the glass top to go on top of it
and this is mainly for riches stuff I
really like to hang my clothes he's not
really that bothered either way so he
folds more of his clothes up the top two
drawers we have one each for underwear
and then the top drawer I have for my
pajamas loungewear and sportswear and
then the rest of the drawers all for
rich I like that this is also another
bit of surface area for me because on
top of the drawers I keep my jewelry I
have necklaces rings and a little mirror
from Urban Outfitters so let's talk
about the wardrobe that is behind me so
the space we had for a wardrobe is a
very awkward space I'll show you what it
looked like before we put a wardrobe in
it was a very small space with a sloping
roof so that means that we couldn't just
buy wardrobe and put it in because we
looked at so many the measurements
wouldn't fit
it would really stick out and be very
bulky in the room so it really felt like
we only had one option which was to have
a kind of open wardrobe and I did look
at the idea of just having like a
clothes rail but I don't think it was
enough storage space to me that wouldn't
be any way to put my bags or accessories
so a really good family friend of mine
actually owns a company called Manhattan
closets and they really don't do
anything like this so don't take this as
an example of their work they do amazing
like walk-in wardrobes but she helped us
out massively to create something just
for us so we looked at the space and I
kind of told her how much stuff I'd want
to hang that's like tops or dresses
because you need a longer space for
dresses and we came up with this so I'll
talk you through the Wardrobe first of
all I have
IKEA drawers at the bottom and I'd seen
this on Pinterest and they looked just
really good why'd they open really
smoothly so we got two drawers
and in the bottom jaw I keep my jeans
and I heap some vest tops in there and
then in the top drawer I keep some
long-sleeve tops and all of my t-shirts
I'm definitely a t-shirt holder by the
way I don't know what that is about but
I guess I wear them like every day just
above the IKEA drawers we put a long
rail there and that is for all of our
tops rich does hang some of his trousers
there as well and some of his suit
jackets and then a lot of my tops like
shirts long sleeve tops jumpers polo
necks basically most of my tops I like
to hang there I feel like if I fold them
they just get creased and I never wear
things that folded so I like having it
all out I think a lot of you are going
to ask like deal clothes get dusty if
you haven't got anything like any doors
and do you get moths or anything like
that I haven't had any problem I try to
clear out my wardrobe every season and
then I'll give it like a really good
wipe down then but yeah we haven't had
much problems with dust like on our
clothes someone suggested on Twitter
that I had a curtain go across the front
but I think that it would make the room
feel smaller and I really don't mind
seeing my clothes like no one else comes
into our bedroom and I don't mind seeing
it it's easy access so I quite like it
so just to the right of the tops is a
longer hanging section so here we can
hang trousers and dresses and I have a
few kind of long cardigans there as well
there's a bit of space underneath the
dresses so I tend to like put my
suitcase there because we haven't got
anywhere else to put it
so then above the clothes is a bit of
storage space and this is where I keep a
lot of my accessories so on the right
hand side I have my sunglasses and I
recently bought this perspex storage
unit for Muji it can be for anything
really but it fits sunglasses really
well so I keep all of my sunglasses in
there don't ask why I have so many
sunglasses it's never sunny in the UK
but I'm completely obsessed so I have a
couple of Dior sunglasses and then a few
pairs of ray-bans and these wild Fox
sunglasses that I never wear but they're
just too cool to give away I keep the
cases for the sunglasses behind in case
I ever want to kind of take them out put
them in my handbag then to the left of
the sunglasses I keep a few of my
scarves and some of Rich's belts in
there in case you're wondering we store
our coats in my office I have a coat
rail in there and then we put our shoes
underneath but we really need a shoe
rack because it's just such a mess in
there so on the top shelf I have all of
my handbags first of all I have a shoe
box where I keep my most worn black boot
I don't really know why they're there
but I suppose it's just easy to grab and
then I have all of my hand bags you'll
see most of them are black I've got an
aspen or of London bag I've got my Chloe
bag if you want me to do a full handbag
collection video I can but here's kind
of an overview of the handbags that I
have I do like to keep them in dust bags
most the time but for this video I took
them out of their dust bags apart of my
why I sell one but because they are like
out in the open I like to protect them
in their original bag so that's my
wardrobe I got through that far quicker
that I thought just to mention the
hangers that I use I get them from more
plan and then non-slip hangers they're
not that pretty but they just do the job
and I hate when my clothes slip off
hangers especially when it's open I
don't want them to fall into the floor
so these are really good to make sure
the clothes don't slip off I'm not sure
what else there is to say but if you
guys have any other questions on our
wardrobe and how we store our clothes in
our bedroom please let me know I did
want to make this video like really
fancy with me walking through my bedroom
and talking you through my wardrobe but
I just have no one to help me film I
wish I had a youtuber boyfriend I'm
gonna have to try and train rich up but
hopefully I'm gonna be able to show you
around some of the other bits in our
flat as well I'm thinking of doing a
lounge tour soon I just have to figure
out how I'm gonna film it but keep an
eye out for that and let me know what
else you'd like to see in our home
