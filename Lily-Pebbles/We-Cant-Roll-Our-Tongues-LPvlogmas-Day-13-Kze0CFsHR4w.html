quite a chill day today which is sister

about we just had a really chilled
morning I woke up quite late and then
edited my vlog which was a long one it
was quite hard to edit I hope you guys
enjoyed the X Factor vlog Annie's just

handbag very pretty oh I see what's
inside
but others have shown little pink of
course
Bailey story to me Oh lovely straight
hair sorry I'm a 215 image we've
just area Masood
Bailey's got chocolate ice cream is the
worst at drawing and meeting Bailey now
is finished early as the worst at
jewelry
we're talking about favorite Christmas
songs Bailey I'm telling you Claus is
coming to town yeah just popping into
Waitrose on the way home because you got
anything at home for riches oh I thought
they right now yeah one mate Richards
going away for a couple of days good
duck yeah why do they fly in a V oh my
god I think we learn that at school it's
nice to do so they can see where they go
is a coordination why do ducks fly in a
V formation that's just sort of today
it's just reminds you my teacher knew a
trolley
I mean a basket oh my god this is the
most exciting day of my life
they're back they're back no wait I need
one for the journey
cooking some of these up for our
afternoon snack honey and rosemary pork
chip a latte
so I said it wraps in smoked bacon
mm-hmm my life is now complete
again Oh this batch isn't as sweet as
the last one or maybe then it's not as
good as the M&amp;amp;S ones but okay that
normal grace is a slight sweet
aftertaste they're still better than
normal great so jess is literally just
left I'm already in my own Christmas
onesie which you might remember from
last year I can't I think my Tesco I
love it and we're dressing gown which I
just can't get enough of it's so cozy
good I love it
all right I have a long list of things
to do the first Easter is scheduled the
vlog because that hasn't been done yet
before I get on with the many tasks I
have to do I have to target the bedroom
because I think rich might actually
change his mind about marrying me unless
I do I'm I've just I was doing so well
but then my flawed robe started and it's
all spiraled out of control so I'm gonna
do a quick ride home
we're just watching home Alone's whoo
and I've been taking photos for a blog
post I've got coming up and the sausages
wrapped in bacon have just come doubt
the oven coming out come out the oven
they look the arm and they smell good
I'm just painting my nails of gold with
this Topshop heart of gold nail polish
whew very festive sit in front of the
tree my Jo Malone candle burning
watching home alone to rich has been
mostly in the bed so that we can make a
yummy soup and we've got the part what
means like the ginger it all together
but we can't find our ginger you can
find like the bottom bit which is this
but not the actual thing but rich we can
put in the Vitamix I just think in what
we have to do it batches you being all
domestic smells young little bit of
seasoning right something they're not
too much business top sorted by the way
we've killed our Ivy pond it's so crusty
and I'm really upset we have to get to
Ikea and buy another one yeah there's
definitely a special setting for soup
yeah it's the one that's got a picture
of a bowl and hot stuff coming out of it
that was so quick give it a little mix
and see if there's any big lumpy but ask
you a little taste she's got a bit my
stock yeah definite
smells good
okay close your eyes taste it this yeah
try some yeah
mmm Richie little Jamie Oliver Oh take
that spoon back in you just licked it
loads we're gonna have the soup than
these new amazing bowls that my sister
Carly got me for my birthday thank you I
think she got Korea yes
nope I think she might got them online I
did she got the chopsticks McCurry
either way they're amazing they're deep
they're heavy beautiful my perfect kind
of bowl
thank you yum yum yum The X Factor final
is about to start really excited but I
kind of want a snapchat as well and I'm
really torn a snapchat or vlog currently
do both you guys love my light lied X
Factor snapchatting so I might do that
and by the time this blog goes up the
snapchats will still hopefully be
available so you can find them on my
snapchat which is there's Lily pebbles
but I'll try and blog as well who do you
want to win losing the final Louise and
Reggie and burly mm-hmm britches door of
the day so that Simon Cowell's is a far
too big for him he'll need more to say
in the matter
they're just too big I don't understand
someone mean someone is a star him yeah
I hope that money in everything one day
actually just performed and it was
pretty emotional is the last performance
a little montage and everything all the
teenage girls in the world are probably
crying right now I'm on T making Gigi
every time I look at this plan I get sad
do you have it a normal t90 rich is
gonna have a TP chocolates in mint tea
hmm okay so we're at the break now where
Adele's gonna perform and then they're
gonna announce the winner so both Louisa
forgot with her name's Louise and
roshambo D have done their winner song
and I would just like to say that I
think it's ridiculous that they get
given the same song they're completely
different acts there's no way they could
see the same song and both do it well I
mean that one actually wasn't even
suited to either of them I think it was
a really bad song that they chose they
could pick from any
Simon Cowell could actually have his
pick from any songwriter in the whole
world and they chose that song and I
think it was really disappointing I
think it was really unfair and Reggie
and burly because you could tell they
didn't want to do it it was so on them
and what a sad way to work but like I
said last
performance I I think Louisa might win
now because of that I think a lot of
people were voting now in this break
that's all I have to say on the matter
Louisa 1 oh my god she's like
hysterically crying how could she even
process this it is time for bed
I'm gonna go wash my makeup off and get
to bed
rich I was gonna turn the camera on you
if you don't a thought of the day yeah
duck my highlight of the day was seeing
the kids at lunch it was really nice to
see them they're just such hilarious
little people that's all for of day 12
is it 13 I'm not sure you probably won't
see rich you definitely won't see rich
for the next couple of days because he's
off to Vienna tomorrow then I'm gonna go
join him on Wednesday so the next couple
of days might be I mean hope you're not
boring but it's pretty much gonna be
just me in the vlogs so I'm gonna be
very lonely but hopefully you guys can
keep me company I'll see you guys in
tomorrow's vlog thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
