Sunday hair on a Saturday greasy hair
the cardboard to wash and I'm massively
regretting it because I'm going out
tonight how that's gonna work but anyway
I have my hair and a half up barn and it
looks ridiculous down here I missed a
parcel I'm gonna get that now I didn't
vlog yesterday Friday had a bit with day
off but luckily it was good timing
because Thursday night my best best best
friend got engaged and it was the my
won't talk about much because it's her
thing that it was amazing she's like
FaceTime to us a half 11:00 at night we
were just crying I didn't sleep the
whole of Thursday night yesterday I was
exhausted
we saw them it was so so exciting I
can't explain how fun it is when your
friends start getting engaged to be
married
it's like a whole new level of
excitement I feel like such a grown-up
so we are kind of celebrating with them
tonight
who is my new strat free bag that came
that I'm gonna open up and show you guys
strawberry is really nice like small new
kind of new Scottish brand welcomes
those really pretty box ooh and ooh and
then like a nice duster bag now this is
what the bag looks like so it's like a
small black one it's got this really
cool handle look like this they're like
lick sover and then that opens like that
that's really cool it's a really nice
size actually this is what it looks like
on can you see can you see really nice
bag I think I really like this the way
it opens at that and that's really cool
actually I'll put the link to strawberry
in the description box below this video
if you want to look they've got some
really nice they really like
sophisticated bags I think so yeah go
check them out if you're interested I'm
having lunch in about an hour and a half
so I don't eat too much I think I'm just
gonna make two eggs I'll probably fry
them which isn't too healthy but I
really like fried eggs and ketchup and a
bit of salt I never know which aisle to
use there when I throw my eggs because
olive oil has too strong of a flavor
coconut oil I don't really like the
taste of it and I know you can get
odorless coconut oil but I think they
still stink of coconut oil it just makes
the whole egg smell like coconut oil not
reassure out the oil so let me know what
all you use in the pan of zero news
butter I'm never really sure with fried
eggs so I'm using olive oil just a tiny
bit but it will be a bit weird so I'm
gonna eat my eggs I'm gonna sell the
safer much better
be and then I'm gonna head out for lunch
are now any better I'm in cover garden
now and I'm gonna do something really
really round in this whole weekend has
been very wedding seemed in arrived very
embarrassing sudden there's lots of
people here and so we're now going to
look at wedding dresses as random as
that sounds but there is a reason we're
not none of us are getting married
its completion did some modeling so she
did lights amazing wedding gestures
should have ridiculous and then they'd
like mode on pictures and put them all
around this wedding just convention
thing so we're going to go
I've never looked at wedding dresses
before so I'm excited okay we found the
hotel let's go find Keisha her in a
wedding dress that was really cool I
wasn't allowed to film in there but I
did get so I got a couple of sleeve on
the shores of Keisha on these huge
ridiculously huge billboards which is
really cool and so the design was just
in Alexander we actually met him he's
really nice Kishin is in really well so
that was fun I don't know I still think
I'd be really weird in a wedding dress
but I don't know they were very pretty
see this video over here this video you
see this car over here
dynamos in that car we just saw him in
the driver's seat where's he going what
is he doing oh my god what is talking
about her in here
I like he doesn't really cool check how
good that be just over here
my dynamo
look at this crowd
we are included in this card right now
he just gonna ask for a photo
you're pretty fancy quiche
the magician is that we just cute and
you just got a photo you didn't say like
hi how are you like so if you can give
it that much time okay that's we talked
B hi brother sir
happy again that was pretty cool dynamo
just like rocked up I thought that was
good and rosy if we look on - it's in
there like dynamo just did a massive
chicken Silicon Valley no you walked
away from it
this is the predicament why did he just
walk up in his car and the center square
copper garden the busiest time of day on
a Saturday maybe citation I just know
that he would he knew he's moving in
that reaction and he's gonna true row he
wanted to see his friends should go ask
him we're gonna go back we're gonna go
back the Seavey's doing the trick cuz I
Justin convinced I just I don't think
he'd just randomly come shopping now
he's just post in her picture of her
dynamo which is like that and your
Instagram name is quisha underscored
that there you go can fill her the white
company now this is Keisha's in there
and you say they are not like some crazy
sieve model so far he's like three shops
that you're in there she is
she's in the photo frames to she's up
here - very cool that she's everywhere

her off
