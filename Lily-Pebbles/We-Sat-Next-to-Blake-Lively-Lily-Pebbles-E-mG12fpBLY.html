so I haven't blogged since Friday
technically I landed in Heathrow
yesterday morning Sunday morning after
like four hours sleep on the plane I
always find that the flight back from
New York is bit too short they have like
a full sleep so I felt a bit groggy but
the weather in London and the UK has
been incredible so I kind of got home
unpacked showered made myself feel human
again spared the day of my family having
a barbecue and then repacks because this
morning I'm heading back to Heathrow
imagine heading to the South of France
with Chanel we are staying in some pool
devons which I know really well it's an
area I went to growing up like every
year my absolutely loved it
we're staying in the most beautiful
hotel called column door which has been
around since like the 20s I think it's
incredible so I can't say I've eaten
there before but I've never stayed in
the hotel so I'm so excited
and then we are actually gonna go to
grass because I'm pretty sure this whole
trip is about perfume launch although we
haven't been told much about it yet
hashtag is new Chanel 5
so I'm guessing there's like an update
on Chanel number 5 perfume I don't know
but I am so excited I feel like the most
lucky girl in the world to be going on
this trip with Chanel staying in a
beautiful hotel in one of my favorite
places in the world so I can't wait I'm
just waiting for my cab to take me to
the airport and the best part of it all
is that Ana and Ruth are also gonna be
on this trip they're like way to fables
we're gonna have such a good time
together I can't wait to catch up I'm Z
Nana in ages so that would be really
nice
I only got to see rich for a day but
I'll be back on Wednesday and then I'm
here for the rest of the month
I'm at the airport and we're just
waiting for Anna to ride already hello
we're headed to the plane now and then
we're going to go on are very excited
that she was on the plane she really
looks really nice very fussy
carrier in CS you look up see beautiful
really cool shoes there was a baby who
was so cute very like fun sort of like I
know I'm not going to assume that she
was still have like but really cool and
then she wasn't like schlumpy clothes so
then we got off the fly and Anna went to
toilet and she saw a bleak in the toilet
then took all their millions of
suitcases to the car and her baby she
does an outfit change in the toilet and
then walked out which I will insert a
clip now of her walking out till all the
packs like private jet famous so I'm
very impressed I think she was really
cool great start to this true
and now we're in a really nice car and
we're gonna hit some Buddha books I'm in
my hotel room and it's so beautiful look
at this view out the window oh my god so
this is like some food at once it's so
pretty gonna do a little bit shopping
and mooch it around because it's not
quite sunny enough first in by the pool
so we're gonna head down there now I'm
back at the hotel and just realized that
my New York vlog that was scheduled is
only three minutes long something went
wrong along the way which is so annoying
so now I'm just trying to fix that and
the Wi-Fi here is terrible so I'm taking
I'm gonna be able to reload it while I'm
here I'm feeling very frustrated I'm
really stressed out you guys know I like
to be on time in my videos and now I
feel like by the time this video uploads
city on three percent it's gonna be like
you're gonna be asleep I'm gutted I'm
gonna leave it to upload while we go and
have dinner but yeah that's really
disappointing I just realized what
happened it's not that the upload went
wrong it's that the export from Final
Cut Pro X some reason it only exported
three minutes of the videos all you guys
thought was me at the end of the night
in my pajamas like how degree no I
you must have thought what the hell is
this video so now I'm just reading it
and then I'm gonna try upload it while
we're having dinner we're eating in the
hotel tonight and we're here with some
journalists as well and we haven't met
all of them yet so it would be nice to
catch up over dinner this has been a
little bit stressful but I'm hoping that
the video goes up tonight otherwise it's
gonna mess up the schedule of everything
I've set it to upload I'm gonna go
downstairs meet everyone for dinner and
just hope for the best trying to
FaceTime rich but this is all I'm
getting right now I'm back in the hotel
room and we've got quite an early start
tomorrow so I'm gonna get ready for bed
and get some good sleep in tomorrow I'm
not gonna vlog I think instead I'm gonna
try and make like a bit of a more
special video because we are going to
Chanel fields which is where they make
the perfume in grass they are
re-releasing Chanel number five a new
version they're keeping the original one
but they're releasing a new version
which is lighter and more modern I've
tried it I really like it and we're
going to be going to the Rose feels
because one of the notes in the
Hume is mayrose it's May Rose fields are
full of beautiful roses then we're gonna
pick some ourselves I just can't wait
and I want to really soak up and enjoy
every minute and I'm gonna film and take
some photos so server vlog like this I'm
gonna try to make it a bit more special
so I hope you guys will like that
hopefully that'll be up tomorrow sorry
for timings be messed up on these vlogs
but thank you for watching today and I
will see you guys tomorrow night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
