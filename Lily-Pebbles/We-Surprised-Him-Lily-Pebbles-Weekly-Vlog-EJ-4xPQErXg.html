a super busy day today I don't even have
enough time to really introduce this
vlog I'm gonna head now to Pilates which
is me where I used to live so now I
don't actually live that far so I've got
to leave quite early actually I'm lying
I'm going to the doctor's first and then
I'm going to put Artie's TMI but my
stomach cramps are getting worse and
worse every month and I thought they're
meant to get better as you get older and
I'm on the pill so I'm gonna go to the
nurse and check that out and just say
why the hell do I suffer so bad every
month so that's where I'm going now I
just realized I didn't explain why I'm
fully made up but half of me isn't I'm
going to Pilates but then I'm kind of
pretty much going straight to starless
live me and I are doing talk there I'll
explain it later which is why I'm
wearing so much makeup to do Pilates I
normally go bare face okay I'm home and
I didn't film any Pilates because it's
bit awkward there's other people in the
class really by did quite well this week
I've just rushed home and I haven't got
much time actually today is basically
sinus live stylus magazine if you guys
aren't from the UK UK only maybe it's
not but it started in London basically
it's a free magazine you get every
Wednesday and you it started off like
you just get on the tube I think it's
easier to get now and you can get on
iPads and stuff but it's like one of the
best magazines and it's free so I've
always loved stylists and they've got a
big like three-day event in London it's
cool stylus live and they've got talks
and stands and like all cool stuff going
on aimed at kind of eighteen to thirty
female demographic which is kind of what
the same audience that I have and so me
and Anna are gonna go and do like a
quick talk it's not really a beauty chat
because it's kind of a different setup
but I think we're gonna do like get to
know us Q&amp;amp;A type thing and we have no
idea how many people are coming because
we're not on the website so the only
people who know about it are the people
that we've told so it might be quite
small crowd which would be nice actually
so basically I've got to meet them there
in like an hour and I still look like
this that's why I have makeup on so I'm
going to have a quick kind of body
shower and I'm gonna do my hair and
figure out what to wear that rhymes in
the meantime I also have a phone call
about my best friend's hen that I'm
planning there's only a month left it's
getting intense okay my hair's done I
got a cup
the other day at hirtius ins I normally
go to the one in Harvey Nichols but my
hairdressers away for a month so it's
the one in conduit Street and had a guy
put primly and he was great and he was
hilarious it made the whole thing you
were very fast and yeah I like it short
all right I need to pick what to wear I
just don't know I don't know maybe dress
and tights okay I think I'm gonna wear
this kind of high-necked jumper dress
thing I don't have to be smart I just
have to kind of look like me I do need
to touch up my face makeup there I think
my eyes are okay I need to put some
contour on phone calls it longer than I
thought and now I'm sure like I'm gonna
be late which I probably won't never
late I'm gonna rush there now I'm here
at the design center in Islington must
turn right and not crash a little bit
late I need to get some crisps or
something I'm sorry
look how big it is
I'm gonna go for a walk around
afterwards but we've got like 10 minutes
and I think we're talking in that stage
there
Geronimo Goering is the beauty editor of
stylists gonna kind of intro us to do a
lot Q&amp;amp;A tomorrow Ana's joined us you
made it ohh
ready finger pink elephant
for this great vlogging material you
looking for - are trapped on stage all
right we're going to head down to the
stage we've got a 15 minute Q&amp;amp;A chat and
then 15 minute meet-and-greet if there's
anyone there to meetin's hurry
we've finished our little Q&amp;amp;A thing that
was so good
Joanna McGarry was a really good
interview it wasn't she it was really
fun I could have talked to agent then we
met loads of you guys after I said thank
you any of you guys who came it was
lovely at the HERA mouth I might try and
quickly have a look around then Rihanna
I feel like I think I'm going to gather
the parameters with Mustafa Knights go
home you can play you can pose and take
you on the front cover of stylus there's
so much stuff there
all right yeah I'm gonna go home that
was probably one of my favorite events
that me and Anna ever spoken at just
because it's such a cool event there was
so much cool stuff going on and I feel
like every one of the audience was just
like a 20-something Londoner which is
basically me so I felt like I had so
much in common with everyone and it was
really great to chat and lets people who
like we're working there also read our
blogs met some really cool people and it
was very short but sweet I wish I
could've spent longer there I am now
rushing home because I need to pack a
suitcase oh my god I take long I
normally take weeks to pack so this has
really rushed to me I need to pack a
suitcase for the weekend have I told you
guys what we're doing today I don't
think we have we are going to Daylesford
farm for the weekend there's the farms
like a brand you can buy the food and
shops but they also have cottages you
can stay out at the weekend that's in
the Cotswolds and we're going as a
surprise my one of my really good
friends xxx this has been a surprise for
about a year he hasn't known we've kept
it quiet his wife he's my best friend
organized it it has been so hard to keep
it secret I nearly ruined it this
weekend this week because I messaged the
wrong whatsapp group say like Oh Rob
hates us because he thinks that we
haven't done anything for his 30th I
sent that to the group that Rob was in
but I saved it and it's been really
awkward and now he thinks that I've like
got problems with him it's just so
awkward all for this bloody surprise I
can't wait tonight when we turn up we're
gonna knock on the door he's already
gonna be there and we're gonna surprise
him and then we're gonna spend the whole
weekend together there's like two four
six eight of us yeah eight of us going

and cozy when I play board games eat
amazing food I can't wait
so and he's head home pack finish up for
the day finish doing my emails and then
we're driving to the Cotswolds so
excited I'm sitting down having some
pasta and butter and Parmesan cuz that's
all we have we have no food chopper you
here and I'm so hungry I haven't eaten
all day really so this is the plan I
have an hour to pack so it's gonna be
like supermarket sweep and we're gonna
go into our bathroom grab whatever
naturally feels like to pop my day
routine it up okay I have my Disney
hoodie to relax in and some cashmere
socks my pajamas are currently drawing
I've got like a comfy shirt for Sunday
that I'm gonna wear with black jeans
blue jeans for tomorrow that I'm gonna
wear with my big comfy potent neck

been
Oxford or Cotswolds wherever I'm going

tracksuit bottoms and then that's my
makeup that's all my skincare body care
hair care straighteners I think that's
everything go take my hat it's meant to
be it's meant to be very cold this
weekend so this should come in handy oh
my god I was just emptying my handbag
and transferring stuff into another bag
for the weekend and I've just realized
that my Sophie home bag which was an
absolute fortune from Liberty should I
get something out and I realized that ok
you can't receive maybe you can there
there's a giant rip
that's one big massive hole you see that
what the hell I'm gonna take it back to
Liberty because they normally really
good with things like this so I really
hope they can do something about that I
don't have a traveler at the moment none
of my perfumes are small enough to
travel with so when that's the case I
normally just hit my perfume and
basically spray it onto my case so that
my clothes smell of my perfume for the
weekend this really nice girl came up to
us at the slightest event this morning
and she I remember she owns a brand or
works on the brand Macy she gave us some
really lovely gifts so I thought I'd
show you the brands called Maria Allen

jewelry look how cute this necklace is
she was wearing this now it's it you
love it no any other things I'll show
you what else she gave us so so sweet

make a really quick drink and then we
are going we're gonna go meet Gemma at
my parents house cuz like a middle
ground place and then we're gonna drive
together after the Cotswolds
and we're gonna surprise Rob he has no
idea we're coming it's so funny he's
like we're trying to arrange like a fake
birthday thing on Sunday night so he
doesn't like like think doesn't suspect
anything but he really isn't anyway he
probably thinks we're just insane Sunday
night so I can't wait to see his face I
don't know how much I'm gonna vlog when
I'm there I'm gonna try and vlog it so
that you guys can see it because it's a
really cool place but I don't know if
everyone who I'm with wants to be in the
vlog so it might be that's of kind of
montage and stuff but I'll try my best
to vlog as much as I can
taking some still was so much time pain
cuz we moved in and got engaged at the
same time so we have loads of champagne
