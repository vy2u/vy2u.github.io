morning I thought I'd do a little
weekend vlogs I haven't done one of
those in a while you will say that you
miss rich and everyone although I'm not
really seen rich much this weekend but
anyway Saturday morning I've got ready
quite quickly
my hair is driving me mad because it's
like freshly washed so it just has
nothing going for it right now
but I'm going to the vogue festival
today it's in Kensington Gardens and I'm
so excited because I'm going to watch a
talk with Charlotte Tilbury and Kim
Kardashian Charlotte Tilbury hilarious
and I really like Kim Kardashian so I'm
looking forward to that and then think
I'm watching one with Alexa Chung Anna's
going to be there I think there's some
other bloggers it feels really weird
doing this on a weekend I don't normally
see like bloggers friends on the weekend
pop man or of course so that would be
nice and tonight is my friend Esther
day's birthday tomorrow I think we're
going dress shopping with my sister so
I'm going to try and capture it all for
you guys a little update on my older
sister Carly who's pregnant I think I
updated you in the last vlog
she's now one day overdue her baby was
due yesterday as I said she has been
ready to pop for weeks her baby is more
than fully grown and she went for a
check-up yesterday I will spare you the
gory details but that baby is coming I
think they said that she's been in labor
for a few weeks now gradually so they
said as soon as she starts having proper
contractions she has to get to hospital
fast because that baby's gonna come out
quick so she's in Covent Garden now
having acupuncture and my mom's
convinced that as soon as she starts
having acupuncture she's gonna go into
labor so my mom's like driving to Covent
Garden ready to be there because
obviously she's got a sim we've got to
look after ASA why she's having a baby
it's all very exciting stuff so I really
hope she has the baby this weekend I
still think it's gonna be a girl my bet
is definitely on a girl rich you think
it's a girl or a boy rich thinks is a
girl okay so I'm just getting ready and
then I think we're gonna head into town
this is what I'm wearing to the Vogue
Festival kind of smartcash I don't like
to get too small on the weekends rich
what are your plans today while I'm
hanging out Kim hyun-joong what eat food
yeah and go to gym yeah when am I gonna
eat food I just wanted to show you guys
something we're on our way to Kensington
my
parents wedding photos oh my grandpa's
not alive anymore my grandma is you if
you see follow me on instagram you
probably seen a photo of her she's
incredible their wedding photo got
scribbled on basically where my auntie
was little she scribbled on their faces
and if you can see like with blue pen
which is such a shame because sorry for
the Pompeian let's look how beautiful
this wedding photo is so I actually took
it snappy snaps to get it fixed they did
quite a good job like considering I
can't believe that you can actually do
something like that I mean I think my
grandpa looks a bit like he's had his
always done my grandma looks a little
bit like she's got beard but I'm
impressed so this is the new copy and
they've got rid of all the scribbles so
now it just looks like a really nice
wedding photo I'm very impressed
I love this photo okay I've arrived at
the both world I think we need to pick
up my tickets I have no idea who I'm
meeting a where I'm going but and
obviously we shut the ticket had a quick
mooch around there's a shop in there
with jumpers it's a folk and I really
want them freeze here in London today
whoo and I like a dungarees thank you
look very uncommon expression you do
look fresh on are we gonna head over
currently I think words about the Kim
Kardashian's here there's a huge crowd
huge queue we probably can be sat in the
back and not be up here exactly
so as I can see her go into the Royal
Society
everyone's getting very excited could
kill me aren't you just
and phones and cameras like crazy we got
terrible
you tell us your photo you got I mean
that's great
sparkly dress bum you could sell it oh
yeah oh my god this looks fancy I'm
looking carnea tear and everyone's just
taking photos I mean I can only get back
with head
where we come back we went to the Kim
Kardashian a Charlotte Tilbury talk and
it was so good I mean I already loved
him Kardashian I feel like if you were a
bit skeptical than that thought would
have really made me fall in love with
her she was really charming and very
funny and very professional and relaxed
and took every question like in her
stride I really enjoyed it
did you enjoy it there was so good thank
you
yeah she was very funny yeah she did and
she would fill up how she's really in
flight natural makeup a moment that's
not so much like contouring Oh fake
eyelashes no fake hair extensions like
not non Doreen yeah that's so good sorry
yeah so we're actually starting because
it's 3 o'clock I haven't eaten since
breakfast so you come to come to our
Lebanese I think is another year so it's
waiting for a table I've integrated
cameras and aubergine tagine which I've
also made an order cuz it's my face off
I'm back now with rich and we're heading
to one of my favorite shops which is
good home and pantry because we need to
buy my friend SJ birthday presents her
it's her birthday today
so it's a really nice shop I think that
I'll be able to find something in there
that she'll like we get into that age
now and nobody needs anything or once
anything so we just define like nice
little things you couldn't find anything
I'm always terrible at buying presents
but I feel like has to be really
something meaningful I can't buy
anything even though we don't you can do
presents anymore I don't know I think we
go east off shop because I feel like
she'd really like some of the ESOP post
Poudre ops it's a really random prison
but I think she'd really like we're in
the ESOP store and I got her the post
food drops and the nomina the hand wash
the reverence hand wash which is the
exfoliating hand wash I think she's
going to love them the store is
beautiful it's going to catch up with
some work reply to some comments and
schedule tomorrow morning's video and
get all of that sorted before we head
out tonight going to pop tonight for
drinks for s J's birthday which should
be really nice I think we're having
dinner as well we've got loads of
alcohol left from our wedding wine and
Prosecco tasting so which is having an
afternoon class at Prosecco yes here
we're heading out to the pub for drinks
with esterday I've just changed into a
leather jacket and my saline bag and I
have her ESOP present here and I forgot
to get a card so I had to write on the
box but you know she's not she's not
really the card keeper kind of person
that this was Gemma I would literally
have to go out buy a card because she
cares more about the card than the
frozen I think SJ would just be happy
that I've got her anything I'm getting
quite hungry now so looking forward to a
nice pop dinner
this is Tash and she made much the most
amazing cake I showed it Hey yes it's
good isn't it yummy
we're demolishing this cake is nearly Oh
God whoops I forgot to finish my vlog
I'm home now had a really nice evening
for Ashley's birthday in the pub had
some drinks and had some birthday cake
and now I'm home I'm gonna go to sleep
no update on the baby she hasn't had it
yet oh I'm servation I just wanted to
have it tomorrow hopefully when I wake
up there'll be a message saying Carly
went into labor it three mmm she's had
the baby or something like that I don't
know see you guys tomorrow
hi good morning everyone it is Sunday I
don't know what's going on my hair it's
that really awkward length which is why
it's doing this weird like flicky I'm
trying to grow it a little bit just
because I'm not sure yet what I want to
do with my hair for the wedding so until
I have any kind of hair trial or
whatever I don't want to cut my hair
just in case um definitely not growing
it growing it but just not too sure yeah
it just needs to get past this awkward
stage there's no baby yet she is so
nearly having this baby but it seems
that quite a nice sunny day today I'm
just waiting for Rich's sister to get
here she's driving down from Suffolk and
then today me and Jess Jessa's richer
sister and my sister Jojo are all going
shopping because Jody needs to find a
dress to wear to our wedding so I said
I'd go with and help her we starting up
at Topshop
we've got a personal shopping and thing
booked but she's 34 35 I don't know how
old she is but I feel too old for
Topshop so I feel like she will too
although she has slightly younger tastes
and dresses than me Jojo loves her like
sparkly tight dresses so maybe she will
find something if not we're gonna be in
like ox a circus area so we can look
around and some of the other shops so
this should be a nice shopping day
hopefully baby will come we can all go
there this afternoon see the baby I'm
desperately trying to work this into my
routine Oh doorbell we're in town but
it's 11 o'clock and nothing's open so
we're just wandering around trying to
find some juice
Jojo and Josie oh yeah Brian Wilson Pet
Sounds Jojo and Jessa here hello and on
the hunt to find a dress for Jojo he
just want to find some shoes to go with
her dress what are you looking for in a
dress
something that doesn't make me look like
a teenager or like an old mother or in
the detox kitchen giving some juices I
remember the bright beautiful because I
always get that Jojo Jess I've never
been here so they're taking much longer
to decide just tell me if you like it
was too vegetable even I get I've
finished my juice but these two are
being pathetic they've had to put sugar
cube in it to try and make it Teresa
we're all being very sad and waiting for
Topshop to open this is very uncool
we're in the shoe department of Topshop
so disappointment isn't for another 20
minutes
I need a pair like black semi heeled
shoes just trying on these Steve Madden
shoes they're really comfortable I've no
idea how they do up so I'm going to come
back and try the one another time we are
in the personal shopping section and
being just taking a seat outside while
jodas gone into suite number three and
hopefully hopefully they can find a
dress there's not that many kind of
wedding appropriate dresses and top
shops you might have to look around but
planning is a sweet smart rich one that
I've chopped it's actually really nice
to try it on quite a few dresses now I'm
not sure any of them are quite right or
they should try on please do she really
likes it she might get about Jojo is
gonna get this I don't know if it's
money for a wedding but it's a really
nice jumpsuit we've been into and other
stories oasis jigsaw Karen Millen Ted
Baker nothing yet
we're going to go get some beautiful
Leone and then go and look at needle and
thread and liberty and then Kate Paige
hi I'm going to go for Eddie katsu deep
fried prawns with spicy sauce
7/7 charm there's one of my other
favorite dishes right there in Liberty
now amateur on needle and thread stuff
which is all here oh this is dress
number one
my critique is actually really Lucy
you're in Liberty right now guys look
how nice this dress is I so could have
worn this to my wedding oh it's so
pretty
maybe I am I could have won this too I
would happily wear wedding dress like
this yeah she really liked that dress
but I think it's the wrong size we're
trying to find it online which is also
going to try on this long black one in
the meantime it's very pretty
but it doesn't really fit you
and also it's very formal
we're in Selfridges we've been trying on
some other dresses all same then we
still have found one which is very
annoying but I just went to the Saline
counter to ask them about my bag and
they were so rude and I'm helpful I
wasn't expecting them to like instantly
make my bag better but she was like it's
nothing we can do take it to a dry
cleaners if you want I just been really
rude and she said it's your fault
wearing jeans she said it's your jeans
fault
and I was like wow moment walk around
holding my handbag like this anyway it's
good to know it probably won't be buying
about saline again because customer
service wasn't happy and such a shame
when you're investing in as president
handbag you expect it to be like better
customer service and it was probably
worse than other places
I got myself a jam donut and then these
guys are you getting cupcake no that's
why the minis are four we've popped back
home and said goodbye to Rich's sister I
actually went to my parents and we saw
the kids briefly and kind of gave them
dinner but I kind of forgot to vlog in
our home and I feel like I haven't had a
proper like Sunday because you've been
shopping which is really not like a
Sunday thing to do so we actually gonna
go see SJ and Rob again even though we
saw them yesterday I don't want the
weekend to be over yet and I don't want
to stay at home tonight you'll be so
boring so we're gonna go have dinner and
watch britain's got talent together and
it'll be really nice i forgot to vlog
din and we went to franco Manko which is
sourdough pizzas and it was really yummy
and then I needed to buy some chocolate
because I needed to and I got these
shell kinder chocolate bites and now
we're gonna watch Britain's Got Talent
on my tester days and Rob's but I might
just blog when I get home later so I
didn't vlog much up this evening but we
were just chilling out with friends and
it just didn't feel appropriate to get
the camera up because it wasn't really
much to vlog we watched Ricky Gervais
animals which either I have never seen
or haven't seen in like ten years I
can't really remember Carly still hasn't
had the baby and she is not happy about
it so hopefully tomorrow or the next day
I'm sure if she hasn't had a by Tuesday
something will be done but I just hope
she has it like tonight or tomorrow for
her sake she's not a happy bunny I don't
know if I'm vlogging I will let you guys
know if not I'll probably like tweet or
something oh maybe - my phone goes I'm
like ah oh no no baby okay I hope you
guys liked this vlog I will see you in
tomorrow's video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
