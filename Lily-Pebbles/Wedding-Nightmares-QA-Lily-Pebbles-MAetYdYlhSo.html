be doing a Q&amp;amp;A video I haven't done one
of these in a while I asked you guys on
Instagram and Twitter for some questions
and wow I got about 456 questions on
Instagram which is crazy I did not
expect to get that many at all I used to
get questions like what's your favorite
makeup brand now they're like really
deep intense long questions but I love
it thank you so much for leaving a
comment with your question if you did I
feel terrible that I can't answer them
all but I'm gonna answer as many as I
possibly can so this will probably be a
really long video but I spent a long
time going through them I picked out
some of my favorites and I'm gonna stop
rambling and just get on with it
there's no order to these I've just
screenshots of my favorites and I'm
going to start with this one
what are some of your favorite apps at
the moment besides snapchat Instagram
and other social media so on my phone I
really like mosaic er it's a really good
app for scheduling your Instagram posts
so not only can you see the layout but
you can also pre kind of edit and write
the caption for your photo so that if
you're in the middle of dinner and you
need to put an Instagram up you you can
just press publish and it kind of goes
up automatically you don't have to write
the caption so that's really good for me
I've also been loving the reminders app
which comes on your phone anyway you can
create all different lists I've been
using that a lot for the web bean it's
really good because you could just tick
off the boxes when you've done what you
need to do it's really satisfying and I
just find it really easy to have all the
lists on my phone on my iPad Pro very
fancy I have been loving the procreate
app so this is the app that I've been
using for drawing and calligraphy I drew
this one for my friend Lucy recently
when she was going to Ibiza so that's a
really fun app to play with different
kind of here this is the Apple pen so I
can do drawing and write some cool
things I've also really been enjoying
mainly Murata's coloring adventures so
that's like the coloring book which you
can find in stores but it's so nice to
color it on the iPad you can change how
big your pencil is you can rub things
out it's just so satisfying and I find
it really relaxing with all your social
media and vlogging do you ever thought
you missed out on me time if so how do
you overcome that feeling yes I
definitely feel like I do when I'm out
with friends I really make a conscious
effort to try and not to look at my
phone all the time because I don't want
to be like that as a friend but with
rich at my
I think they know that it's all part of
my job and I'm very aware that I spend
too much time working and too much time
on my phone and filming but for me the
way I think about it is this isn't gonna
last forever and I'm now in this crucial
time where you know I'm possibly at the
peak of my career really enjoying what
I'm doing having many kids I haven't got
that many responsibilities in terms of
like me time so I can be a bit selfish
and spend a lot of time on my work and
it's not gonna be forever so that's the
way I think about it but I'm definitely
need to get better at putting my phone
away in the evenings because I find that
I look at my phone whilst watching TV
and then think oh I better put my phone
away and then within seconds I've picked
it up again and I find it really hard to
switch off will there be a little video
about your wedding day or deeper keeping
it private there is gonna be a video
after looking for a really long time I
found a videographer that was happy to
make a separate video for my youtube
channel because obviously I don't want
to put my wedding video on my youtube
channel because there's going to be some
private moments and people in the video
that might not want to be on the
Internet
so I'm having a separate video made that
will hopefully kind of capture the
atmosphere of the day in little details
and moments I want to share it with you
guys you know I'm not that private I've
shared so much so I don't know why I
would keep this private the reason I
haven't talked about the wedding much
just because I don't really want
everyone's opinions and what's right and
wrong but after after the wedding style
I'm sure I'm gonna be like oversharing
you guys are gonna get very bored about
hearing about the wedding if you could
be any age again for a week what age
would it be if I like I've had this
question before and I would have
probably said like 18 19 when I was at
my gap year but actually I think like 10
years old which might sound crazy to
some of you but I loved my primary
school I went prime school with my
friends SJ and Keyshia and Jenny and if
you guys know them from my videos we'd
loved school we had like such fun we had
like a girl gang we still like perform
on the steps to sing Spice Girls and
like life was so easy then you thought
it was difficult if like a boy didn't
fancy you but it was just so fun you'd
go back to each other's houses after
school and yeah I just love to relive
that feeling of like having no care in
the world have you had any wedding
nightmares I get married in nine months
and I've joked about no one turning up
because I forgot the invites I've had
two wedding nightmares one of them was I
forgot to invite people and pretty sure
that was what it was I can't really
remember that one but the other one I
really remember I often wear like black
vest tops under my clothes more in like
autumn winter time just as like a bit of
a security another layer of warmth I
just have so many black best tops and I
always wear them and I had a dream that
I was walking down the aisle and I'd
forgotten to take my black vest top off
from underneath my wedding dress you
could see that I was wearing a black
dress top and then a wedding dress on
top and it was awful
what a weird dream I had that one like
ages ago so if I mean if you haven't
watched stranger things yet fast-forward
like 30 seconds I'll give you a minutes
do it do you think 11 is still alive yes
I think 11 is definitely still alive it
was that whole bit at the end with the
waffle definitely also she's too good of
an actress to like kill her off already
okay I'm waving my hands in the air to
the people that are fast forwarded you
can you can listen now what's the most
amount you've ever had on your boots
card and what did you purchase with it I
never spend my boots points I'm so bad
like that but I think it's the best like
points reward scheme that there is I
think the most points I've ever had is
80 pounds and I still got like leftovers
from that but I suddenly noticed one day
I had 80 pounds so I bought Chanel
vitalina aqua foundation and still got
quite a few points on there as the
wedding approaches what is the one thing
about rich do you find the most unique
and the fact that he hasn't got one
ounce of insecurity in him I find that
really attractive in someone when I
think insecurity is the cause of many
problems in life and if you're
completely secure with who you are then
it changes your relationships with
everyone and rich is not at all insecure
he's not at all cocky or overly
confident but he's secure with who he is
and that's I think his best quality how
are you managing work and wedding
planning not well I just don't know how
I'm very lucky because I work for myself
that I can be flexible when I do wedding
stuff I think if I had a normal office
job it would be really hard to just do
things in the evenings and weekends when
other people might not be at work
because that's the problem I'm finding
is that you're relying on other people
to email you back and face
then everything's delayed I've been
struggling which is why maybe my videos
and blog posts haven't been as good as
normal because I feel like I'm spending
all my time doing wedding planning and
I'm really looking forward to getting
back into work I think if you have a
really boring job that you hate wedding
planning could be so funny you put all
your time and effort into it but I think
if you love your job then wedding
planning is just a distraction and I'm
really looking forward to getting back
into work I love my job and I miss
working on it full-time have you ever
felt envy how do you deal with that kind
of negative feelings definitely I think
everyone has felt envy and jealousy and
at least once in their life but yeah
definitely and I think when I started
out in blogging and blogging became more
popular and new blogger started coming
around definitely that was something
that I struggled with but I realized
quite a few years ago now that that
feeling of jealousy and envy is such a
horrible feeling to have it doesn't
benefit you as a person and actually if
yeah if there's someone you're jealous
of reaching out to that person say
someone else won something or beat you
reaching out to that person to say
congratulations I'm so happy for you
leaves you feeling so much happier as a
person then it would if you were just at
home jealous and bitter so although that
may be a selfish way to think about it I
think that's a good place to start
that's where I started I actually made
me feel better to to comfort someone or
congratulate someone when I was feeling
jealous and that's something I always
try and remind myself as someone's doing
something that I'm jealous of if I
proactively show that I'm happy for them
it makes me feel better too and I I just
realized that it's not something worth
being jealous over I hope any of that
made sense what is your favorite cheesy
pop song from the 90s
first one that comes to my head is
Hanson Bop classic when you're scared to
do something new what do you do to
convince yourself to go ahead and try it
well I think something that really helps
with that is being surrounded by the
right people I'll never forget the first
press trip I was ever invited to when I
was working full time I was invited to
Morocco with a group of journalists I'd
never met and I really didn't want to go
I was just so nervous and rich said to
me if you don't go I'm gonna break up
with you which sounds harsh but he
pushed me and encouraged me to do it and
I
that really helps when you're around
when you're around people like that it
helps with trying new things but also
just think about what you're gonna get
out of it new experiences are so
valuable I'm someone who really thinks
about the fact that we only live once I
think we only live once and there's this
one life and you need to make the most
out of it
so saying no to things and passing on
good opportunities just it was like such
a waste of a life do you think you and
rich will continue to live in London
after you're married I had so many
questions about do you think you much do
this after you're married do you think
you'll be like this after you're married
nothing is going to change we've been
together for nine years now marriage to
us is just a very normal next step
neither as a nervous or scared about it
we're just excited to put on a big party
to celebrate our relationship nothing's
gonna change we're not moving we're not
our relationship won't change we're just
getting married it's really it's not
gonna change how we are so that answers
that question was yes we're gonna stay
living in London are you going on your
honeymoon straight after the wedding or
are you waiting for a while we're going
away somewhere in the UK just for like
three days after the wedding just to
like so we don't have to go straight
back to work basically but we haven't
planned a honeymoon yet we both really
want to go on one we haven't quite
decided where but we definitely will we
just haven't had time to plan it I don't
know how people have time and money to
plan a honeymoon whilst planning a
wedding but soon as the wedding is over
we're going to assess the situation and
start planning and thinking about where
to go who's the most down-to-earth and
likeable person you've met who is a
famous youtuber well I guess it depends
how you define a famous youtuber but I
like the big like youtubers that have
been doing it for a long time and have a
lot of viewers Tyler Oakley was such a
nice guy I've met him a few times and
he's always so friendly and humble great
guy really really liked him I met Jen in
recently in LA and she was such a babe
so so nice it's rare that I meet someone
whose videos I like and I'm disappointed
in them I feel like most people love
themselves and videos favorite pasta
dish and pizza toppings if it's like a
cheap pizza like a domino style then I
like pepperoni and mushroom if it's like
a fancy pizza I like rocket and salami
yeah that kind of thing you know there's
always like a salami rocket option pasta
I like arrabiata which is like a spicy
tomato sauce or
chiana which is like tomato with onions
and little bacon bits oh I love pasta I
also love pesto or like linguini with
prawns he has named like four pastures
sorry have you ever dealt with
homesickness and was it hard for you to
start living your own adult life yes I
really suffer from homesickness I used
to a lot I used to go on camp when I was
teenager even though I was so so
homesick and I still get it now
sometimes I sometimes get it when I'm
just sitting on the sofa at Rich I'll
say oh I feel a little bit like homesick
he's like what are you on about
sometimes I just get that feeling in
terms of like living my own I love life
moving out away from my parents
it didn't really suffer with that I
thought I would be really homesick but I
think when you find someone who you
truly truly love and feel comfortable
with they sort of take over from your
mum you feel like no one's ever gonna
replace your mom and no one's ever gonna
make you feel as safe as your mum does
or dad but then you find someone and
they do so being at home with rich like
it's comforting to me and I don't feel
like oh I wish I was at home in my
parents yeah what TV series would you
recommend I've recently really enjoyed
stranger things I thought that was
brilliant
now cos I don't really know how to say
that but that was good and then the
second series coming soon for like funny
TV shows I love modern family bloodline
I started watching that I didn't finish
it but I really liked it that's all I
can think of for now those are the
questions that felt really quick was it
quick I don't know you can never tell
when you're filming if that was really
quick or really long but those are the
questions that kind of stood out to me
and I hope you guys found it interesting
hearing my answers thank you so much for
sending all your questions to me if you
like my makeup today I actually just
filmed a makeup tutorial and that's
gonna go up next Sunday so don't forget
