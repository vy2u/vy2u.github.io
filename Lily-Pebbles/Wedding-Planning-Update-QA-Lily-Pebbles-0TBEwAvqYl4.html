doing a Q&amp;amp;A and I asked you guys on
Twitter to send me some of your
questions I said ask me anything could
be beauty related normal you two related
anything random so I collected some of
my favorite questions to answer in
today's video just quickly a couple of
disclaimers I know that this setting is
really weird don't worry I probably
won't do it again
just trying out something new and it's
probably a good thing that I'm not that
close because my eyebrows are in such a
state at the moment so let me know what
you think but I'm pretty sure I'm gonna
go back to being a bit closer I feel a
bit far away also this lipstick which is
stealer liquid lipstick in patina I just
think it looks a bit weird on me so if
my face looks a bit strange I think it's
because the color of this lipstick
doesn't quite suit me but apart from
those two things I'm ready to film this
Q&amp;amp;A video I've printed out one of your
questions here and I'm just gonna get
into it Rodgers asked chunky chips or
skinny fries definitely skinny fries
Harry asked favorite place you've ever
been also where is the next place you
want to visit so my favorite country
that I've ever been to is probably
Thailand and the next place I really
want to go is South Africa I've never
been I've always wanted to go me in
which there may be looking into doing
that for our honeymoon we're not really
sure yet but it's definitely on my list
of places to visit India and merely
asked have you ever had braces yes I
think I pretty much had every brace that
exists when I was 14 I got braces I had
a retainer
I had elastics I had headgear train
tracks and I had them for four years I
didn't wear my retainer properly so my
teeth kind of got messed up again so if
you are a teenager I really recommend
wearing your retainer so then a couple
years ago I also got clear guide braces
which are like the clear ones that you
put in you can't really see them they're
like a retainer and they really
straightens up my teeth my Boston teeth
were so so wonky and now they're pretty
much straight I'm so happy with them I
used to have the worst teeth that I was
younger I finished the course of braces
now so my dentist fixed a brace to the
inside of my bottom teeth that they
don't move back and then I wear my top
one at night still a lot of people ask
me how much those costs it really
depends on what you need so I would say
just go and find your nearest dentist
that offers those kind of braces
they'll kind of price up for you Melanie
asked what can you say in French bonjour
je m'appelle lilies upbeat song blue
tear jiggled ray on punish Alcala por la
petit dejeuner Sifu play pretty basic I
should speak better French considering
how long I've been going there for my
favorite French word is definitely
grapefruit which is
Pomplamoose Charlotte asks what do you
think you'd be doing in your life if you
never got into YouTube I get this
question a lot and I think I'd be doing
exactly the same thing but instead of
running the social media and marketing
for my own brand I would be doing it for
another brand so I'd be working for a
company and running their social media
channels coming up with marketing
campaigns and new ideas of how to
promote the company it's pretty much the
same thing I just do it for myself in a
weird kind of way
Marketing has always been what I've been
good at I'm definitely an ideas person
and I love the digital world in social
media by the way no one asked if I'm the
big spoon or the little spoon I am
definitely the big spoon and proud girls
can be big spoons too Kayla asked how's
the wedding planning going it's going
good I think we've got a lot of the big
things sorted like venue caterer dress
we're being quite organized because I
always like to be ahead with these kind
of things but now it's just kind of
sorting out the little details which are
the really nice part of a wedding I
think we're trying to make it very
casual and personal but I have to say I
personally don't find wedding planning
as glamorous and exciting as people make
it out to be I think it's quite
stressful when you have to do it
alongside a job if you've always known
what sort of wedding you want then I
guess it's different because you maybe
have like a scrapbook of ideas but I'm
just not that kind of girl and I found
myself having to make these like big
decisions on things that I'm not sure I
really have a strong opinion about so
that's been quite hard and I'm really
looking forward to the actual wedding
but not loving the planning so much
Emily asked what's your favorite season
probably either spring or autumn maybe
autumn because I don't really like
extreme so I don't like being really hot
and I don't like being really cold
autumn in London is beautiful Robin
asked how do you manage your spending
finances I get so drawn into buying
things and run
money so quickly I've always been a
saver ever since my first job when I was
about 15 or 16 I loved the idea of
saving my money whether I'm saving up
for something or just having it aside in
case of emergencies I don't know where I
got that from but it's always means
something I've been quite strict or
myself with so I would just suggest open
up like an e savings account with your
bank and every month when you get paid
or every week whenever just put a little
bit aside and even if it's just like 10
pounds a month at least that's something
and then you can eventually gradually
build on it when you can't afford to I
think having savings is so important you
can always reach into it if you need to
but it's really good to have that there
it's important just to keep an eye on
your finances get online banking check
it every Friday and just keep on top of
things
Melanie asked what jobs did you want to
do when you're a kid when I was a kid I
wanted to be a singer and a pop star
I still love singing but I think there's
a big difference between being able to
sing in tune and being a great singer
and a lot of people at my family work in
the music industry so I was never naive
about the fact that yeah I could sing
but I didn't ever had a unique special
tone to my voice that was gonna make me
successful in such a difficult industry
so that dream very quickly got pushed
aside I'm a realist so I didn't want to
chase something that probably would
never happen
that sounds really depressing but
there's always karaoke I do love karaoke
Kesha asks do you see your channel
evolving either with content or spinning
off a book or business I sense a change
and I'm excited I think my channels
always evolving and I think it always
has since I began if you've been with me
since the beginning I think you'll see
this massive change now - when I started
I think the beauty of having a YouTube
channel is as I grow my channel will
grow with me and the contents always
changing depending on what I'm
interested in I'm sure you guys noticed
at the moment there's not so much beauty
stuff because I'm just a bit more
interested in lifestyle and food and
home interior and I've never really
committed to one category because of
that it's the Lily pebbles Channel it's
an extension of my personality and
whatever I'm into at the time I'll make
content about it and I really appreciate
you guys for letting me do that and just
allowing me to make videos about what I
want to make I definitely think it would
change as I grow up as for projects and
books and things like that there's
nothing major on the cards at the moment
I really don't want to rush into
anything big like that unless it's
perfect I am a perfectionist so who
knows if something comes up that fits
I'm up for something new and exciting
but in the moment I just want to work on
making my content as good as it can be
and enjoying what I do
Becky asks what's the color scheme for
your wedding we're not really having the
kind of wedding that would have a color
scheme as I said it can be very relaxed
and personal although I do want it to
look aesthetically pleasing obviously I
don't think there is a color scheme I
think it's gonna be very kind of a
neutral you know these sort of questions
that stressed me out Marie asked who is
your favorite friend's character such a
hard question but the first person I
thought of was Ross Geller he just
really makes me laugh Terra asks did you
have a 20-something crisis what do you
do when you feel totally lost about life
have you ever felt this way definitely I
think people who say they've never had
that kind of life crisis feeling
especially in their 20s I mean I don't
know who those people are but they're
very lucky because I think no matter
what situation you're in you always have
that feeling and for me it was those
couple of years after uni when I really
felt the pressure to find my career path
and figure out what job I wanted to do
in the future and I felt really lost and
I wasn't sure what industry I wanted to
work in but the way I dealt with that
was suggest put my fingers in all the
pies is that a saying I can't remember
what the same is but I wanted to try
everything because I thought as soon as
I get stuck in a job as soon as I start
renting I'm gonna have all these
responsibilities and I won't be able to
try new things
so while I'm living with my parents I'm
gonna try as many different types of
jobs as I can and find the thing that
works for you you know I got what I
thought was my dream internship for
three months and after a week I decided
I didn't like it so I quit and I tried
something else because there's no time
to waste I feel like those years are so
crucial
so try as many things as you can build
up your CV and that's how I kind of got
through my early twenties also don't
compare yourself to other people that is
just a terrible thing to do everyone is
so different so don't look at people and
think all they're doing so well because
everyone has their own time to do stuff
Alice asked what did you do for GCSEs
and what grades did you get for those of
you who are from the UK GCSEs are there
like exams at school they're spread over
two years and how old you are like maybe
15 16 when you take them so there's
certain subjects you have to do like
English language and literature science
maths I can't even remember I've like
blocked out my memory I was forced to do
single science by my teachers which
means that instead of getting two grades
I just got one but it meant that I was
more likely to pass so I've got a C in
science the extra subjects that I did
were French art music and then I started
Italian which I loved but I really
clashed with my teacher and ended up
quitting the subject because we just
really didn't get on so until I had
seven GCSEs which is quite low most
people do 8 9 some people do 10 I've got
five B's and to cease the annoying thing
about GCSEs in the UK is they take your
mock grades which is the grades that
your teachers predict you're gonna get
and those are the grades that allow you
to change school if you want to change
school for a levels so I didn't get into
any of the schools I wanted to go to
because my teachers predicted to such
low grades I just think that whole
system is so messed up Jenna asked what
was it about rich that made you want to
initially go out with him I think when I
met rich I hadn't really ever met
someone like him before just from my
like friendship group at home he seemed
really mature and grownup and not at all
insecure that is something I love about
rich there isn't an ounce of him that's
insecure
he's not cocky or overly confident but
he's just really secure with himself and
I found that really attractive and he's
just so kind
he's like the kindest person so selfless
he'll do anything for other people you
guys know what rich is like I love him
Ashley asked are you still doing project
life a lot of people ask me this project
life for those of you don't know is like
a scrapbooking project I did a video
about it maybe a year or so ago when I
did that video I had been doing it for
two years and after that video I didn't
carry it on and I don't think I really
was ever going to I really enjoyed doing
it
two years but I kind of had enough by
then you know came a bit mature and I
just found other things that I wanted to
do instead and I think that's the best
thing about hobbies finding lots of
different things you want to do and kind
of moving on to different hobbies as
well if you're into scrapbooking I think
project life is amazing at the moment my
obsession is with a bullet journal if
you haven't seen my blog post on my
bullet journal I will link it down below
it's like a system for your notebook
makes you feel very organized about life
and I'm loving it the last question is
from Holly she asks what are your key
tips for lasting friendships well I
guess I have really long strong
friendships with friends I've known my
friends Jake and Hannah my entire life
I've known my friend ed since I was
three and I've known my friends Keisha
SJ and Jenny since I was before and
we've all gone to different schools and
different universities and stayed really
close and I think some of my tips for a
lasting friendship would be to not be
overly sensitive about things
I hardly ever argue with my friends
because even if they say something that
I think is a bit like oh I don't cause a
big argument about it if if it really
upsets me I'll just talk to them and
then we move on you know don't hold
grudges I'm really not into holding
grudges and I think just making an
effort I mean I'm not growing at phoning
my friends but will always text and chat
and I don't really know what else why
I've stayed friends with my friends for
so long I think you just have to pick
the right friends really that even if
you don't see each other for three
months it feels like you saw each other
yesterday so those are all the questions
I hope you guys enjoyed this Q&amp;amp;A video

up I'm finding it a bit weird to be so
far away so I might not do this again

little armchair over here thank you so
