has come to an end and I feel like
throughout the month because I was so
busy doing daily videos I wasn't as
responsive on my social media channels
like Twitter Instagram snapchat
I can't always reply to everyone I
really do read every comment and every
tweet and every snapchat but I think if
I reply to every single one I would
never get anything done so I thought it
would be a nice way to kind of round up
everyday May by doing a Q&amp;amp;A video and I
asked you guys I think I asked on all
the different platforms actually to send
me some questions and I said it could be
about anything UT lifestyle whatever you
wanted I asked and loads of good
questions came in it's so funny how
things have changed because I used to
just get questions like what's your
favorite lipstick if you could only use
one brand for the rest of your life what
would it be and now all the questions
are about weddings and babies so clearly
I have aged on YouTube but there are so
many good questions I couldn't just pick
like ten it didn't feel like enough so
I've got loads of questions here I'll
probably end up editing the video down
but it's gonna be a long one I like
watching long videos so I feel like you
guys will too and I'm just gonna get
straight into it always we're gonna be
here forever
don't ever forgotten okay let's start
with an easy one what's first on your
scone cream or Jam also I think I say
scone instead of scorn I don't know what
the correct way is so apparently it's
Cornish or Devon depends on whether you
put your cream first I put cream first
and then jam I think it looks prettier
so much like neater and less messy and
now I really want a scone will you be
doing updates on your wedding planning
and possibly sharing your wedding day
with us I know most youtubers say they
wish to keep it private but after
following you for so long it would mean
so much to be involved that kind of hit
the nail on the head it is a very
private day getting married but I've
been sharing my life now for like six
years so I think it would feel weird to
not share anything I'm sure you guys can
tell by now that I'm showing bits and
bobs when I feel comfortable with it I'm
not gonna be telling people the date of
my wedding and I think that's just will
add to the nerves of people like wishing
me luck or tweeting me like the day
before but it's a huge part of my life
and I love sharing my life that's why I
do this so I will definitely be sharing
some stuff I just feel like I'll
probably be sharing it after the wedding
I feel like once we're married and it's
done I'll probably want to tell everyone
everything and show you guys photos and
videos and like scream about it but now
I don't feel that comfortable telling
too much just because I feel like
there's so many
and if people were to say they didn't
like something you know gets a bit
confusing in your head it's a big thing
to plan anyway so too many opinions can
get a little bit messy so I'm more
likely to share after the wedding then
lead up to it what is the one thing you
can do today you couldn't do this time
last year work out I started getting a
personal trainer nothing drastic I only
do it once a week but I'm getting quite
into boxing and I can do squats and
push-ups and sit-ups and I definitely
couldn't do that this time last year so
I'm very impressed with myself and I
feel much better for it hi Lily just a
question for your Q&amp;amp;A what's your
favorite song and Beyonce's new album oh
my god that is so hard to pick I think I
like to hold up I love daddy lessons
that's like really bluesy
have you chosen your wedding dress if so
was it a lengthy process or did you find
it easy
so the wedding dress thing was strange I
always said growing up that I don't want
a white wedding dress I just want to go
to Selfridges and buy a nice dress
that's actually harder than it sounds I
was really really shocked at how
expensive wedding dresses are I thought
let's just go to wedding dress shops and
try some stuff on and see how I feel and
everything I looked at was 2,000 pounds
and up and that to me is crazy
I know wedding too expensive but
personally I like to spend the wedding
budget on things are gonna benefit
everyone and there's no way I would feel
comfortable spending anything like that
on a wedding dress so I was already a
bit confused by that I've had friends
that said that they went to 14 different
shops to try on dresses and they hated
everything so I was kind of expecting
that but actually I found that
everything I tried on I quite liked they
were all really pretty and some were
really elegant and some were really
casual and I think what I found is that
it wasn't so much about finding a dress
that looked nice because they all look
nice I feel like wearing a beautiful
long white dress is lovely but it has to
fit the wedding and the vibe and the
venue and when I put on my dress
I did like a little dance and luck my
friends have said that they did the same
thing they just started dancing and
that's how they knew it was the one and
I just felt comfortable and it was very
casual and very me and I know I don't
feel like I'm dressing up in someone
else's dress I'm really happy with my
dress you guys will see it at some point
I'm sure why did beauty shop stop with
viviana makeup would you ever start
again so in case you guys don't know me
and Anna used to do monthly videos
together called beauty chats and they
just came to an end because we've been
doing it for like two years and we felt
like we were just repeating ourselves
and answering the same questions over
and over again we felt like we were
annoying you guys but I asking on
Twitter for more questions every month
and it started to feel a little bit
forced also animoves away so it's much
harder for us to get together as often
but we never want to do something just
for the sake of it so we put that on
pause to work on other more exciting
things that we're planning for the
future but we do need to fill more
together we would just forget because
we're both so busy so if you guys have
any ideas of what you want to film
together I love filming with Anna so
that is definitely on the cards did you
do a levels if so which ones and how did
you find them so a levels in the UK or
what you take at school from the ages of
17 16 to 18 it's like split between two
years so in the first year I did art
drama studies or theater studies I think
it was called music technology and
psychology
I got a you in psychology which is
unclassified so that doesn't even count
as a grade in the second year I ended up
with a C and art a D and drama and a D
and music technology and what I found
with a levels is I got to the point
where I had to make a decision and the
only things I was interested in school
with the arts and actually those are
really hard subjects because you can't
really learn how to be good at art you
have to have a raw natural talent for it
and I was finding that although I was
creating like what I thought were quite
good pieces with art a level you have to
be able to really describe what you've
created as well and that was always the
bit that I really struggled with found
the whole thing really frustrating music
technology was so hard that's all like
the behind the scenes stuff so like
recording studios and it was a new
subject to my school the teacher didn't
really know what the curriculum entailed
and we all kind of did quite badly I
really enjoyed it but I just didn't do
great at it and drama again it was
really fun but clearly wasn't that great
at it anyway I never did well with
grades but what to do if you could have
a dinner party with three youtubers who
you've never met before who would you
invite L for what's up mums kc nice tat
let me look through my subscriber list
Tom Fletcher he'd be fun Katie nice that
Tom Fletcher and elfin what's up mums
that is the most random dinner party
ever
could be like a double date are you
having a hen do a hen do for you guys
who are from the UK is a
bachelorette-party so girls will get
together and have a fun night out before
they get married and can't have fun
nights out anymore got all these wedding
things are so old-fashioned but anyway I
do love a hen do yes I'm having one
my friends Hannah Deb's and Gemma along
with my sisters are planning it and I
didn't want anything too extravagant
like sometimes I get invited on Hindus
and you have to spend like 250 pounds
300 for the weekend and it's so
ridiculous everyone's so busy so I said
I really don't want a huge thing I don't
want too expensive but like set a budget
I asked if I could pay to you but they
won't let me so I have no idea what's
happening they're very very secretive
none of the guests know either but I
think it's gonna be pretty messy I've
said no strippers please and I don't
think they care I think so yeah you'll
probably be seeing me on social media
sometime soon looking at worse for wear
apologies in advance I'm doing marketing
advertising and PR at Birmingham City
University and you are my inspiration
thank you
how would you recommend to build up a
profile to be so successful and get
placements in digital marketing so as
soon as I left uni I really wanted to go
travelling but I resisted the urge
although I would recommend if you want
to you know you're going to be working
for the rest of your life so enjoy it
while you can but I launched myself
straight into internships and I just
took anything I could get I was
definitely at an advantage because I was
living in London and I had my parents to
stay with but find someone to stay with
if you don't and just try and get your
foot in the door anywhere a lot of
places offer a month internship ask if
you can stay for longer I used to always
asked if I could extend it just be
really proactive meet people go out and
talk to people often it my parents
friends parties I'd end up talking to
someone who worked at an advertising
agency and I would just ask can I come
and do a work experience for a couple of
weeks you just have to be so pushy for
those couple of years after you you just
have to push your way into any door and
then you'll find your way to something
from there look on Twitter as well I
think I found one of my jobs on Twitter
I often retweet internships Lulu
Guinness just tweeted about an
internship and I retweeted it so you'll
definitely add an advantage now with the
internet and it's an exciting time so
just be passionate about it and get
I recently got a job that's three days
working from home what are the pros and
cons of having a job where you work
partly from home love your channel thank
you there are definitely pros and cons
and it's very important to think about
that before you launch yourself into a
job where you work from home because
it's definitely something I never wanted
to do my sister was a makeup artist when
I was growing up and I saw how hard it
was for her to be freelance so it was
never on the cards for me I've just
ended up with a job where I work from
home but I knew that I wouldn't like it
so for me the cons are very much
having no colleagues and having no
office I really really miss that office
environment and I think you take it for
granted when you have it I know how it
feels because I've had previous jobs and
you're just sitting there and you hear
voices and no conversations and you get
involved and you're constantly learning
about things and having new
conversations and new experiences and
chatting and when you're working from a
home that is completely gone you're
literally just alone all day so I feel
like I'm missing out on what's going on
in the world because I'm not talking to
people and meeting new people and I even
feel like I've taken a step back in
terms of social skills which is so
ironic because what I do is so social
but it's also really not so I really
miss engaging and interacting with real
people on a daily basis I do try and get
out as much as I can and go work in the
gleam office so if you see me in there
that is why you also have to be a lot
more strict on yourself you have to get
into a real routine it's obviously quite
tempting to just not work because no
one's gonna you know make you do it or
sit on the sofa and watch TV so you have
to be quite a strict person which I'm
quite good at because I want to upload a
video so I'll make time to do it and all
of those things you know it has to be
done but you don't really have anyone
around you encouraging you to do that
work there's definitely pros I mean such
a simple pro but I remember when I was
working in the office just getting a
dentist appointment or going to the doc
so it was such a hassle you had to tell
your boss that you needed time off to go
the doctor and then it's like a waste of
time off just for the doctor so all of
that I mean it's so easy I can just pop
out whenever I like to do whatever I
want and that side of it is amazing I
could probably talk about this forever
in terms of working for yourself but the
question was more about working from
home so I would say those are the two
obvious pros and cons how do you feel
you've changed over your YouTube career
well I think my YouTube career and my
life pretty much go hand in hand so how
I've changed over the last six years
affected my YouTube career and I think
that's just the case of growing up I
definitely make content more for myself
now than for views or subscribers I
think I've got to the point where I
realized I'm not that sort of channel
that's gonna get million subscribers and
my views are gonna go crazy and I'm so
okay with that and I just come to the
realization that I just have to be happy
with the videos I'm making and it's a
much like more calming feeling I take
everything a lot less personally and I
just try and enjoy what I'm doing feel
like I'm being myself a lot more I think
at the beginning I didn't really show my
personality much because I didn't know
that people wanted to see my personality
I thought it was more about what I was
talking about but actually I realized
it's more about how I talk about it and
I think I've just figured out a way to
make YouTube and blogging work within my
life
there was like a year where it was in my
life and I wasn't seeing friends and
family and I wasn't doing anything else
but blogging in YouTube and I think
that's really not what it's about life
is so important so I found a way to do
this and live at the same time did any
of that make sense how is it dealing
with a lot of hate do you get used to it
or is it easier to brush off I get its
question a lot especially when we do
like Beauty chat live people always want
to know how we deal with the hate
because I think that's the one thing
that always puts people off starting a
YouTube channel and it is definitely
something to consider
you know whenever you guys always
comment saying like Jojo and Hannah and
Deb's to suck should start a YouTube
channel but there's a lot to consider
when starting a YouTube channel as well
as all the skills you need to figure out
like filming editing all of that it's a
lot to take on a lot of people don't
want to put their themselves on the
internet because you are gonna get
people's opinions and you are gonna get
hate unfortunately and you have to be a
very strong person to deal with it I am
NOT going to pretend that I'm always
okay with that sometimes I get really
angry it's not so much I would never
like cry about a hate comment but I get
really angry because I feel like I don't
have the opportunity to explain myself a
talk back because no matter what you say
you end up in this is argument and you
always end up looking like the bad
person so I find it quite frustrating
more than anything it's really nice to
have friends like a nerds talk about
when I'm in that sort of mood sometimes
you just feel a bit misunderstood
something would have you would have said
something slightly wrong and people
completely misunderstood it and then
they think you're a terrible person and
the fact that there's websites where
people just
bitch about you it's really horrible at
all for definitely would say one of the
worst parts of this job but not bad
enough to make me quit and I think it's
the same with everyone else there's so
many more positive comments and positive
people out there that it's completely
balances out although the one hate
comment always gets you more than the
hundreds of lovely comments I think
that's just human nature
are you enjoying thinking more
creatively about your videos and do you
think everyday may has influenced how
you think about your content I can
definitely see your channel evolving and
I'm loving it thank you so much
definitely I think every day made only
way I can make daily videos work is by
being flexible and being spontaneous so
taking my camera with me and made some
content out of whatever I'm doing and
that's why I like everyday May it's so
hard to do but I definitely always
finish the month feeling like inspired
to change my content and it makes me
realize that I don't have to do these
big like beefy videos with everything in
it I can make smaller videos like the
Chanel video that was about one thing
one day and it went down really well or
my weekend lookbook I just took the
camera out with me that weekend and made
a video about what I was doing so rather
than canceling all my plans and staying
in all we can to make videos I try and
bring the camera with me and make a
video about what I'm already doing
that's kind of my plan it's hard to make
more creative videos because of the
whole music on YouTube thing it
definitely limits me but yeah I think
everyday may is always quite an
interesting experiment it's good for me
to see which videos you guys like and
which ones I like filming and then
trying to find a balance
are you enriched going on a honeymoon
after the wedding if yes where the
honeymoon pressure is seriously intense
so many people ask you about your
honeymoon and we would absolutely love
to go on a honeymoon we both really want
to do South Africa but paying for a
wedding is expensive and it's a lot to
plan as well so I don't have much time
to plan a honeymoon and we're putting
all the money into the wedding so we're
just gonna think about it after we've
get after we get married we're gonna
assess things and then plan it from
there and probably go the year after I
don't know how people go straight on a
honeymoon after their wedding I would
love to we're probably gonna go
somewhere for a few days off to us just
so we'd have to go back to work
straightaway but yeah we priced up South
Africa and I don't think they'll be
happening just yet but hopefully in
hi daily I love your folks and videos
I'm a bit embarrassed to say that I'm
mid-40s do you think you have many older
followers and do you mind sorry this is
so random Helen Walker this is also
something that comes up all the time
when we do i abuse chat live events
people always say our I'm your oldest
subscriber in like 40
that's not even old you're seriously not
our older subscriber Helen at 40 you are
not old first of all my mom and a lot of
her friends watch my videos and they are
much older than you sorry mom but this
is no age on subscribers I personally
love having all ages it's really nice to
have people younger than me and older
than me I don't really think what I'm
thinking about who I'm talking to I'm
not thinking of someone with a specific
age so my theory is if you like my
videos and you like watching them then
welcome it doesn't matter how old you
are seriously more the merrier I think
it's so good that slightly older people
are getting more into YouTube now
because I think it's such a shame that
it's still not that clear how to
subscribe to YouTube channel and people
still think that subscribed means you
have to pay for it so every time I hear
about you know people in their 40s
watching videos in YouTube I think it is
great and I'm all for it I know how much
you love food if you could only eat one
cuisine for the rest of your life what
would it be people love these rest of
your life questions don't they I think
would have to be Thai as the first thing
that came into my head I love Italian
and I love all different cuisines but
Thai is Thai as the one I'm not sure
whether you would want to share this
information or not but the question I
have your Q&amp;amp;A video is will Keshia Deb's
and SJ be your bridesmaids for your
wedding or will it be your sisters or
someone else so I'm not having
bridesmaids or if that's controversial
I'm sure you guys know by now that I'm
not really into the wedding traditions
well some of them I am but I just
thought you don't have to do things just
for the sake of it and I've been a
bridesmaid before for my sisters and I
know how it feels to be put in a dress
that you don't want to wear so my
sisters my best closest friends they
know who they are they're gonna be in my
room with me when I'm getting ready
they're gonna be dancing with me all
night
I send more letters when I got engaged
actually to let them know how important
they are to me I don't think I need to
give them a label or put them in a dress
they hate or give them jobs to do on the
day just so they know they're important
I want my friends out of everyone to
enjoy it the most my sisters are my
friends I want
the best time and I don't want them to
be worrying about whether they've got to
move a table or put my flowers somewhere
I just I'm really not into the whole
like jobs on a wedding day thing I want
everyone to just enjoy it and let loose
and not be nervous or worried about
anything
so I'm not having official bridesmaids
but they all know who they are what is
your go-to easy dinner recipe I think if
I don't know what to make and having a
much time and I've bit of a panic I
would get a big baking tray and I would
put in chicken thighs like four chicken
thighs I putting garlic sweet potato
cherry tomatoes a red onion drizzle
olive oil over it salt and pepper throw
it in the oven for 30 minutes and it's
done you can put chriskiss with it if
you want but I tend to just have it like
chicken and veg and it just tastes yummy
and home-cooked and it's very easy
because you have to do anything apart
from put it in the oven I'm glad you
voice your opinion on a know traditional
wedding was this always the plan or did
it just happen along the way during
planning well I knew that all the
weddings I'd been to growing up I knew
like what I liked and why didn't like
from them and I think when it came to
planning my own there was just so many
traditions that I just started to
question naturally like why do I have to
be there anyone walking down the aisle
or how come you're doing the speech I
can't do one and these pressures just
kept coming up so we said well you can
or he can so we're just doing what we
what feels right and I feel like some of
the guests who have only been
traditional weddings might be a bit like
what is going on here but we just like
to be ourselves it's going to be really
chilled some of the traditions just
don't make any sense it's 2016 so we're
just doing what feels right and we're
both very lucky that we have very
chilled out parents you just want us to
do whatever we want final question what
a question to end on do you want to have
kids after being married please this is
a this is a notice to all my subscribers
when I get married please don't start
asking me if I'm pregnant all the time
I see this happen to all the other
youtubers it's so unfair we just want to
get married and then enjoy being married
I don't know when I'm having kids yeah
we definitely want to have kids but not
yet definitely not yet and I think
getting married is big enough for me
right now so there's all the questions
I've been cutting them off as I go so I
hope
you haven't missed any thank you so much
for all the questions there were so many
good ones I hope I picked a nice mix of
you guys I didn't want to ignore all the
wedding questions there were so many if
you haven't seen my last video it was a
vlog so you can click here to watch it
if you would like to and also there is a
playlist with all my everyday made
videos so you can catch up on those if
you think you missed any I think I'm
gonna stick to my Tuesday night Sunday
morning routine but I might throw in an
extra video every now and again or I
might mix it up I know that you guys
aren't so much worried about the
schedule from the feedback I got on my
last video so I will bear that in mind
and be a bit more flexible with it
please don't forget to subscribe if you
haven't yet and I will see you guys in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
