evening and I was thinking what video
should I do for Tuesday and I did what I
eat in a day last week and I really
enjoyed making that video I wanted it to
be like a fancy video that was filmed or
nicely I just wanted to give it a go I
did I swear my life it was complete
honest reflection of what I ate that day
but obviously cuz it's a Sunday and I
spent the whole day with rich and we had
a picnic I'm always a little bit more
healthier than I am during the week but
also I felt like because I was filming
it quite fancy I wanted to have a
purpose um once you guys have the
recipes that you could try for yourself
but you watch my vlogs you guys know how
I eat you see me on snapchat so I
thought I would do more of a food diary
I feel like the why I eat in the day
videos aren't really for me but I feel
like more of a food diary is much more
my style so I'm gonna try a weekend food
diary and I'm gonna film everything I
eat and nothing is planned apart from
dinner tonight we have no plan so I have
no idea what I'm gonna eat this weekend
I'm not going to vlog in between because
I've got lots of important things I need
to do this weekend and I can't have a
fully concentrate when I'm vlogging so
it's gonna look like I'm eating loads
because it's just gonna be meal up the
meal off the snack off the snack I'm
gonna start with dinner tonight we are
going to a seafood restaurant we've
never been to I'm not a massive fish fan
but I do like some seafood so I'm just
gonna give it a go
I only just put the camera down I'm
already hungry but I'll show you guys
what's in our fridge because me and rich
rarely eat in on a weekend we normally
just eat out I don't know why it's just
a habit I have from growing up my family
we will eat out a lot this is what's in
our fridge there's really not much here
like a bit of yogurt fruit Philadelphia
but nothing for it to go on bottle of
wine cucumber and some random veg and
then other random stuff here so I'm
gonna have some cucumbers keep me going
till dinner
good morning guys it's Saturday morning
I am starting the day with a cup of tea
PG tipps and skimmed milk and for
breakfast we don't actually usually make
breakfast like this but we kind of
bought some stuff yes slate we thought
we'd be hungry sourdough bread with
scrambled eggs smashed up avocado and
bacon and ketchup
I have ketchup with like everything my
family have always made bacon in the
microwave and I know people think it's
really weird but we like crispy
american-style bacon and that's the best
way to get it in the microwave like five
minutes since I'm going to have a
breakfast yum it always happens being
rich plan to just stay in today and
chill and then my sister takes me saying
we're going for lunch do you want to
join us and then I get family FOMO so
we're heading to an Italian restaurant
for lunch not that hungry though so I'm
going to try not to go order
we came to Kings Cross just to get some
stuff from Mac I'm going to do a little
ball on my snapchat go follow me there I
think we're going to go and get a cup of
coffee or tea or cake or something now
because it's like 4 o'clock which is tea
time especially in the UK there weren't
any night cakes so I just went for a
single shot Bart a rich black white just
an update which is somehow convinced me
at 6:00 p.m. on Saturday to go for a
workout I don't know how well or
terribly this is going to go because
unlike the personal trainer I could just
say no to rich so I probably will end up
just doing nothing but he convinced me
with the promise of a takeaway so that's
probably what we're going to end up
eating tonight we're gonna go do some
kind of workout and then i'll update you
guys on dinner ok we're back from the
work how we did some serious like
running up steps and jumping lunge
things and step i have no idea what we
did right exhausted I'm just I'm running
too so I feel good and we got some
takeaway we got big band back which is a
Korean dish of like rice and wonderful
stuff
I got deep-fried pawns rice kimchi kara
all different things in here - Korean
dish absolutely delicious and some spicy
dressing YUM
good morning everyone it's Sunday and
I've just been lying in bed watching
videos Anna actually just put up a
vlogging star ye in a day and it's
brilliant I feel like our videos are
very different so it's fine that they're
going up is similar time this is
definitely more of a food diary if you
want some inspiration on how to light
meal prep and eat healthily when you are
at home go with Anna's video it's
brilliant it's just I feel like I'm
failing at life but I'm going to try
very hard to learn to be more like her
because that food are really good it's
not breakfast time I have no idea what
we've got but I'm just gonna have a look
actually haven't had a bacon sandwich
for ages and still is my parents but
since it's Sunday and we have bacon
leftover from yesterday I've treated
myself to a sourdough bacon sandwich
with ketchup I just picked up Oh mixed
berry iced tea which is very nice and
refreshing whoa we're now going to head
over to my parents my sister Jo Jo's
birthday today and we're going to have a
barbecue for lunch the weather's quite
good
which is lucky so I don't know what
we're eating my mom is making lunch but
I'm looking forward to it because I bet
beats on the yummy she's a very good
cook we've got sausages on the barbecue
and was that loud yeah
Sunday night I'm prepping to go to LA
tomorrow hair wash riches Carly made
some dinner I think we've got a meatball
and courgette tomato sauce going on here
and we're going to have that with some
rice

looking like this I didn't really plan
that but that is where the video is
going to end I don't need to show you
the final result its vices tomatoey

food diary just to show you a true
reflection of what I've eaten all
