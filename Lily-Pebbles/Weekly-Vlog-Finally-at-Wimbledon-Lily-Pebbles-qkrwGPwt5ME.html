weekly vlog today is Tuesday and I have
a couple of things to go out for I've
just been working this morning it's now
at nearly eleven o'clock I'm gonna head
to the Charlotte Tilbury press tape rest
days for those of you who don't know are
for journalists and bloggers and anyone
who's part of the press to show them new
products that are coming out to explain
how they work so that we can then
communicate to you guys if we want to
about any new products
I don't always go to them because there
are about ten a day and I just can't
possibly keep up I wouldn't get any work
done otherwise what I absolutely love
Charlotte's help your products so I
definitely want to go and check out her
new stuff and then whilst I'm out I have
booked in for a facial at one old witch
which is a hotel in Covent Garden and I
haven't had a facial for about a year I
hardly ever have them because they're
kind of a luxury treat really but also I
find that most salons and spas and stuff
like that use fines like deklay or and
dermatology Dermalogica that's what I
meant and I don't really like this kind
of brands that this one and the spa in
one Aldwych use Askia which is a brand I
love and so I really want to try out an
auskey a facial and see what that's like
and see how it works when a professional
is using the products I'm really really
excited for that that's later this
afternoon so I'm just getting ready cuz
I was gonna give me a lift of the
station and then I'm head to South West
London where the Charlotte Tilbury event
is
I'm at Hyde Park Corner so I'm just
trying to find it's normally the events
anomalies show it to his house I think
this time it's out at the restaurant
I'm at the Charlotte Tilbury launch and
Amelia's here right now and planets
there sheesh okay Cameron chose this
environment sticking with this one
location on a screen yeah you're
especially the techie stuff you instead
that is good
we're just waiting for Charlotte's I'm
actually gonna have to agree the door
the 12 days of Christmas and every day
you've got to make up a bit of makeup
magic and a bit of skincare magic all
through there isn't that fabulous
leaving the charlotte tilbury event it
was really good let's try lots of makeup
and in the planner we're gonna go grab
some sushi because she's got meeting at
4:00 and I've got the facial 1/2 4 so
I'm gonna see your facial you wanna
track no no way so nice having lunch at
Conner and I'm just in one or it's
waiting it's my patients in about half
an hour so I'm just using emails now and
it really excites it's just switch off
my phone for like an hour and a half and
just enjoy a baby
I'm home now so I thought I'd tell you
how the fascia went because it was
absolutely amazing I felt a bit guilty
just before I went in because I had a
bit of work JAMA going on and I very
nearly cats at the facial but I thought
you know what I'm sure the world will
survive for an hour and 15 minutes I
literally never ever turn my phone off
even when I'm in the bath so I just
really need this at that time and it it
was nice because while I was having it I
really did switch off I didn't like to
think about anything and it's a really
lovely facial they use all austere
products including the candle which has
melts down into an oil and you really
get your money's worth because it's not
just a facial but she kind of stretches
out your legs and arms she gives you an
arm scrub and a back massage and the
head massage and they steam your skin
literally puts like a steamer and she
does a bit of extraction if you want it
you don't have to have that I'm not
normally that into it but I found it
didn't really hurt that much
and my skin just feels amazing and looks
very glowy and I loved it I then came
out and the work drama started again and
I feel I'm Chris again but it's fine
because I felt really really lovely
whilst I was in that room so I
definitely recommend it I had to the
think it was the glow facial I can't
remember
I'll write up what a is in there in the
description box because I told my mom
that she needs to go and have that
because she would absolutely love it
it's a real treat I think it's nice
sometimes to just treat yourself to a
facial or a massage we can just actually
switch off for like an hour
I always forget until I have one how
good though anyway I'm just doing some
work now it's like 7:30 I think I might
in the vlog because I feeling a bit
funny you feel a little bit funny the
past two days a bit like can't explain
it but I will vlog again some other day
this week today is officially the most
exciting day that I have had for a very
very long time yesterday very last
minute I got an email from the PR at
Evian which in itself was so exciting
because everyone is in like my top 5
browser ever wanted to work with so just
being able to know someone there it's
really exciting I bloody love everything
but always that they invited me to
Wimbledon and I'm the biggest tennis fan
it's my favorite sport to play too
watched everything and I absolutely
can't wait because everyone had like a
proper suite there and you can like sit
their special seats and drink their
water and there's a lunch and I can't
wait
and I get to bring a plus-one so me and
rich are going and we're gonna have the
best day I've just done my makeup I've
used the Jaclyn hill and Becca highlight
so it I don't know if you can see but
I'm obsessed with it it's beautiful I
know it's a bit intense for a Saturday
daytime but I just love it too much that
I have to use every day I must put some
setting spray on though it's very hot
today for like makeup so ml awful so I
woke up at 5 a.m. this morning pollen
count is so high so I'm taking my pills
with me but I hope I'm not sneezing all
over the place I saw that Tonya Jim went
through the Evian suite earlier in the
week and someone from one direction was
this I feel like there might be a bit of
celeb spotting today I'm not sure I
won't be vlogging them because that was
really embarrassing but I'm gonna vlog
throughout the day wherever I can and I
can't wait I just need to straighten my
hair and everything we're gonna go
okay we have got to Wembley the tube was
packed
I haven't heard of it yet today looks so
smart he looks so smart his white shirt
and Charles's gold dressed up for the
occasion I don't know if I've said but
we're going to watch the women's final
sensical and Serena Williams paints why
my favorite players so many faces I'll
be cheering her on you looking forward
to this yes into the strawberries and
cream of hymns of course for those of
you who are from the UK well then is

Wimbledon and saw such a great match as

touch up my makeup and redo my hair and
change my outfit because we have got one
of our best friends engagement parties
