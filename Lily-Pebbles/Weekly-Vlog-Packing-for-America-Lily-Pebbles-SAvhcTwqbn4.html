I'm actually feeling quite sprightly
from Monday morning I'm normally neither
a morning person or a Monday person but
I'm very likely today woke up pretty
early and I feel like I've I've got
stuff done I've just exported my vlog
that's gonna go tomorrow I'm so late for
tonight when I come back I need to do
the thumbnail and schedule it and
everything but today I'm doing something
a little bit different which I didn't
really know I was gonna be doing until
last minute and last week because they
contacted me and I thought that sounds
like something worth getting involved in
it's basically I don't know what the
official name for it is but it's a
competition run by child net which is
like a model of it's classed as a
charity but a company which helps make
the internet safer for children and it's
a really cool competition where kids
from primary school as a secondary
school have entered in little videos to
win this competition so there's all
these different kind of judges and they
wanted me to be a judge as well because
I haven't got any other kind of
youtubers and we basically have to watch
the little short films and announce the
winners and judge them and I have been
watching the videos cuz we got sent them
last week and they're really cute and
some of them are really really good as
well
so I'm gonna go to South Bank which is
all the way in town to judge this
competition I don't know anyone else
going literally just rocking up on
myself but it should be good and I think
it's something worth getting involved in
and promoting because we all want a
safer internet for our children so that
is what I'm doing this morning
what a horrible miserable day I've just
got South Bank though and realized that
I forgot to charge my camera battery
last night watching so ever get to film
this
here just come out from the competition
I've been there a few hours and I had to
go to judge the videos and then announce
the winner of her scary actually but it
was so good I was so impressed with the
quality of the films for such young kids
and it was a really cute little one and
I just need to take him home he was so
happy
cute but windy I think you can hear me
I'm home now but for a second before I
pop out again I'm going for a hand
meeting I am planning my best friend's
hen party with her sister if you don't
know what hen party is it's a
bachelorette party all about in America
so I'm going to have a head a party
meeting I'm going to drive all the way
to Mill Hill which is an area like very
North London because my friend has just
opened a cafe there you've probably seen
on my vlog before that I went to
bluebells in Portobello he's now opened
one in Mill Hill too so we're gonna go
meet there because it's a really lovely
cafe so if you do live in that area
definitely go check out bluebells it's a
really nice cafe like really good food
and I'm hungry so I go eat
I'm home now couldn't really feel much
our little meeting this day is turned
into a day that really isn't worth
vlogging but I'm kind of still going
with it hoping that there's something
interesting
I'm just making pasta it's literally
quarter to three but I haven't eaten
anything since this morning so I'm just
making a little bit of pasta and then
I'm gonna do some work and then I need
to go and do a bit of shopping for LA
I've got to change the money and get
some bits and stuff and today's the only
day I can do it so we do not later I
mentioned this on my Twitter recently
but since having my Brazilian blow-dry
permanently Joe ever you call it it's
amazing this change my life I was still
happy I had it but I think it's given me
dandruff which is something I've never
had before I delicious I thought I had
knit I didn't know what like white bits
were in my hair but they're like big
toys as bit gross it's like big flakes
um and I've never ever had that before
so it's really strange so I'm gonna when
I go to boots see if I can buy some
stuff dandruff products but also has to
be sulfate free
it's really quite annoying it must have
just dried out my scalp but quite a few
people said that it goes away so if you
see any flaky bits of my hair I'm sorry
I do wash I swear it's nothing to do
with that it's something to do with the
chemicals in the blow-dry thing just in
the Topshop change room trying on a
couple of things I need some new denim
so it's minor social I just realized I
haven't blogs as I go back I forgot I
was vlogging today because it's just
being one of those days what did I get
I couldn't find anything in Boots I
didn't have any like travel mini sizes
left I got some flight socks flights or
flights Ochs very important cross ladies
toothbrush protector this is for the
toothbrush that cleans my braces I found
a Travel electric toothbrush nada you
guys said they do them in Boots there
was a cheap one which looked okay but
this one was a bit more expensive and it
looks amazing
so I can come in and I feel like I'll
use it on her I feel like I'll use it in
all my trips it was 30 pounds yeah it's
expensive but I travel a lot and it's
like Percival's gold and wait there's a
reason why it's 30 pounds is because
it's USB I'm talking to rich by the way
it's us be chargeable there you can
charge with the USB that is so cool
I got some
like clear plastic pots and stuff and
some benadryl so they got from boots I
got honey my niece is her birthday
almost like you not gonna have to see it
can you see that it's a really creepy
head I was like a Barbie head but it's
huge and you can like color and
straighten the hair she'll love that and
I bought some more of these pajamas from
Topshop because Dixie ate my shorts and
rerender them and I bought some new
denim shorts and Topshop because my
other ones are like really bums showing
these these are a bit better and they're
a little bit longer and I bought white
surely it looks a bit like the Navy man
night one haven't you tried it on this
couldn't be bothered in the shop but
it's like brushed cotton and it's got
these nice buttons on it so I'm looking
forward to trying that and that is all I
bought so I think mean rich are gonna
now watch entourage which were a little
bit obsessed with where are we up to you
now six season six and we started maybe
we're doing well so I will vlog again
sometime this week I'm not sure when
right morning sorry for my morning hair
and face but it is Wednesday morning
today and I think I'm gonna vlog today
because I haven't got much planned this
whole week but I need to have another
day to film and today I think I'm gonna
pack for LA and as boring as I find
packing I feel like you guys might find
it interesting to see my packing process
my kind of real non edited non fancy
video packing video so I think today I'm
gonna I like to pack over a few days I
don't really pack all in one go which I
know really kind of strings out but
that's the way I like to do it so my
first step is picking outfits normally
so I like to just kind of try on all my
different outfits and try and plan an
outfit for each day and evening and lay
out on the floor soy de mon by didn't
sleep very well because really really
hurt my neck and shoulder I've no idea
how but I'm really hoping it gets better
before an 11 hour flight because that
will not be
so anyway I'm gonna kind of get up get
dressed have some breakfast and then get
packing because what I'm doing is laying
out all the clothes that I think I want
to take but I'm kind of over laying
because then I'm gonna go through and
put them into outfits and kind of take
things out but as I go I'm trying things
on this is the place you I bought from
Czar yesterday oh my mattress it's got
this kind of polka dot if you can see
underlay and it's V and it's got this
kind of crop top you bit I don't know I
kind of like I wasn't sure but I just
heard my mom and sister and they really
like it this dress is a bit hippie here
but I do kind of like it I feel like
it's good to have some dresses because I
think parity when you're in Anaheim at
VidCon there's a few kind of parties in
the evenings so I might take this way
that's one of the kind of evening
options so this can be another outfit
River right on top with Topshop shorts
they need to iron these these sandals
are basically and go at everything so
that's very handy this top can also go
with my denim shorts which I found on
Topshop I'm going to take this dress
because I love this dress and everyone
always compliments me on it when I wear
it I like the shoulder detail and I like
the print and it's very what's the word
floaty again goes at the sand it was
fine this dress from Topshop I'm not
sure whether to take or not I think I
might take it maybe to wear at the beach
at live event it's quite thin to pack so
I might take it just in case I feel like
you can't have too many dresses but I
just don't know how flattering it is in
photos because it kind of just hangs and
I'm not sure this is my Topshop top blue
top I love the color of this top with
LED the skirt that I got however is from
a beat option was our last year that
could be a nice evening outfit now this
I don't know about it's like a two-piece
long sleeve than shorts I just don't
know if it'll be too hot for this but
then maybe I can write it the evening I
don't know and also I look a bit like a
picnic table oh I really like these
shorts from Evan Outfitters but the only
problem is they just look like pajamas
now I know what I wear them with they
just look like pajamas this is the
long-sleeve novum and night top I think
it's all too like baggy but even with
like a tighter top I don't know I might
take them with because they're pretty
and they're comfy
this is what it looks like with a black
top bit better they still look like
pajamas
this is what happens when I pack I
suddenly just find myself sitting on the
bed looking at my phone I didn't know
how that happened so I think I'm going
to take these shoes and the same pair in
nude when I can find them and my weird
and heel things as well just in case I'm
not sure if I'll wear these but just in
case I want a bit of height then I think
bag wise I'm gonna take my brandy
melville fringe bag this new one from
Zara which is like perspex it's really
weird but it's small and I need just
something like Khalid and then this one
which is stress free
that's like casual black smart black
daytime you like to colored okay so I
put the Zara bag in the brandy Melville
bag and then I've put two pairs of
sunglasses in the bag because this one
can't squish down anyway so you might as
well fill it with stuff it's very
important that I don't forget this this
is my Sephora card I've still got like
the papery wrong sums it up shop there
that often but I'm gonna take this with
me cuz I'm definitely gonna be doing
some Sephora shopping mall on there also
this I'm obviously not gonna show you my
card number this is a Caxton card and
this is really good if you're travelling
in a board you basically load money onto
it and use it like a debit card but it
doesn't charge you because obviously a
lot of UK banks will charge you to use
your card abroad so texts and FX is
really cool okay I've got bored of
packing clothes so I've moved on to kind
of hand luggage stuff I'm gonna take
this Aspen all of London bag but I'm
also gonna take a little suitcase cause
we're going on virgin see you can take a
handbag and a suitcase honest hand
luggage I always think it's good to from
going to melech America and I know I'm
going to shop in just in case I need the
extra space but in my luggage
I'm gonna take my this is from wild fox
it's one of those what they could buy
masks and it's literally the softest
thing in the world I love it
I'm gonna use this as my purse I don't
think my Chanel one just in case I lose
it and my sunglasses and then I'm gonna
take a clear plastic bag for my liquids
then I'm gonna take a shower to every
makeup bag for all the other Beauty bits
I need just like wet wipes and tissues
and makeup remover I'm so impressed with
this travel electric toothbrush that the
lid comes off like that looks like that
need to fair just kind of vibrates
doesn't really do more than that but you
basically pull down this bottom bit and
that's where you charge it with this
little cable yeah that's so clever this
is essential for me when it comes to
flying it's that this works deep sleep
stress less rollable it just smells like
relaxing
and stops me from freaking out and gets
rid of the horrible aeroplanes now I'm
going to take the lana lips
antibacterial hand cream because it's
moisturizing but it's also antibacterial
which is good if you are eating and
stuff on the flight hey I'm starving and
I'm so happy because I think I'm gonna
make war Pad Thai my friend Meg who has
the blog lips a facto has a recipe up
from like years ago that I'm going to
use and I think I've got all the
ingredients I need I'm not sure but I
bought a spiralizer last night where's
it gone someone put it in a drawer hmm
no actually have to find the spiralizer
oh yes it's the one I bought yesterday
Stevie Cameron this is only 25 pounds
which compared to like the big ones my
things but cheaper but also it's just
the size that's like quite a big deal
because that it's just handheld and
capacitors huge machines that no one has
baseball and I use it last night when I
made quiddity and it was great so I'm
going to try it again and I'm gonna make
raw Pad Thai and here the first thing
I'm gonna do is I've kind of got the raw
ingredients a few things missing we're
going to spiralize the courgette and two
carrots
they're peeled carrots for now I'm going
to spiral out those two okay I've added
in my spring onion okay now I need to
use this little blender thing is my
mum's I'm gonna have to bite what I'm
adding because it's so handy this into
here goes a clove garlic the juice of
one lime which I'm going to use this
this thing is amazing my own thing going
on a bit up so long and I was kind of
ignoring her but she's right it really
like squeezes out every last bit of
juice from a lemon or lime and captures
all the seeds I'm gonna use this into
here now it says you can use peanut
butter all about it or cashew butter and
we have all this almond butter that we
need to use up then which we've got from
Costco so is this 2 tablespoons of this
going in with the lime and garlic okay
so that's what the almond butter looks
like in there a tablespoon of soy sauce
teaspoon of sesame oil I love this stuff
a little bit of honey like it says the
third of a teaspoon I'm gonna be like
half a teaspoon and then just a few
chili flakes I don't have any fresh
chili and I really now we need to blend
this all together I think I need to add
a little bit of water to make it a bit
runny and then my arm but I was quite
runny I'm just gonna add a tablespoon
okay I've just given it a taste and
added a bit more honey and a bit more
chili because it was very lime blimey
I'm gonna add this now to the courgettes
I'm gonna pour this onto here
make suggests putting on top some
avocado sesame seeds and coriander which
I have none of so I'm gonna have to
leave mine just like this but it still
looks yummy and this it's gonna taste
good
you can add chicken and porns and
whatever in it as well this is a really
quick lunch and I'm just kind of giving
it a go but I'll definitely try making
it again with all the stuff now I need
to tidy up the mess that I've created
I'm also going to put a bit of this Thai
chilli sauce on top cuz I'm obsessed
with it I love it yeah let me go eat
this now okay while I have Casey nice
that's video wrestling there for me to
watch I can't really do anything without
having like a video on in the background
is really bad I need to learn how to
like I'm like deal with silence anyway a
little tip for packing shoes that you
don't want to get squished stuff them
with underwear this is an underwear this
is like a crop top thing but yeah I'm
stuffing my sandals so that they kind of
keep their shape I think I'm gonna take
this on as like my check-in luggage and
then I'm gonna take a little one as hand
luggage which I never once and people do
that able to turn up so therefore with
like 500 different suitcases but this is
like a work trip so not only do I have
to take like a lot of outfits cuz
normally if I go on holiday I just wear
the same thing every day I know dat care
but this is different of what like
events to go to and stuff so I'm taking
a lot of stuff and I want to keep
groomed to buy stuff and I just hate
that panicky feeling of whether my
suitcase is gonna be overweight or
whether I'm not gonna ask for everything
in so taking that as a hand luggage is
easy especially cuz I only take all my
camera equipment so I'll probably put it
on here so it doesn't get damaged in
here dry I'm doing quite well I'm not
using packing cubes this time cuz I
think sometimes they actually take up
more space I'm just kind of working with
what I've got for me to use that space
somehow yeah I haven't put any beauty
stuff in yet I haven't packed any of
that yeah which is normally the heavy
stuff but I think it's going okay okay
this is what I'm gonna take skincare
wires by derma cotton pads these skin
Iceland a gels Sarah Chapman serum oski
Renaissance cleansing gel Luna facial
oil in there and I decanted some ESOP
Parsi seed mask moisturizer and the
other origins cuz I just finished my
Kate Somerville one just in time for
trip to Sephora and some shampoo and
conditioner by the way finding mini
shampoo conditioner that sulfate free is
impossible I rinse boots and all of the
men
he's had sulfur in and because I've had
a resilient blow-dryer I can't use
sulfate so something to note very hard
to find so I'm now gonna just label
these up using my trusty label maker
that I love
I know exactly what all these products
are they definitely do not need labels
but any other stationery lovers out they
will understand the need to label these
things
this is incredibly satisfying I'm gonna
put the possibly could leak items in
this little clear plastic bag the
forbidden in here I think I'm just gonna
take in this kind of Chanel plastic
thing because I don't know I always take
those big Muji bags and they take up
somewhere space I was I bought some of
these Champa knees Muslim cloths I think
you get three in here because whenever I
take my own when I take out some space
and these are already really compact so
I'm just gonna pop those in it like that
oh god I just realized I forgot to
finish the vlog I've just been kind of
eating dinner and I don't know I've been
doing but I'm now gonna go downstairs to
watch Nashville and I think this is the
end of the vlog I haven't really got
anything else to say I'm still packing I
haven't finished that's about where
that's come to and I've got stuff all
over the bed rich isn't happy about it
can you rich and you pick that back
please put it over here because I can't
thanks so I'm gonna end the vlog here

been boring but I've just been getting
ready to go away but next week there are
gonna be two vlogs la part 1 and la part
