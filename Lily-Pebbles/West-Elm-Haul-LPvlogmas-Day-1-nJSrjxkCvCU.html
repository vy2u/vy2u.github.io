so I hope you liked the new vlogmas
intro I made that really last minute
last week but I was pretty happy with
how it came out so Christmassy and I
haven't daily vlog since everyday May so
this feels weird and exciting I'm a bit
nervous but I really hope you guys enjoy
the next 24 days there will be some
really interesting fun busy days and
there will also be some days where I
don't really leave the flat so come
along with the ride I'm sorry for
anything I say to offend anybody I am
human and I'm gonna try and just
completely be myself throughout this
vlogging thing the first thing I need to
do because it's the first of December
it's open my advent calendar I'm very
lucky I have two of the best Advent
colors I actually haven't got chocolate
one this year I need to get one and I
always just get the Cadbury's Dairy Milk
one but I've got the house of Jo Malone
oh my god I literally got this last week
as a gift and it's incredible and I have
Charlotte Tilbury so I'm gonna open day
one and show you guys what's inside
where's day one on this one is so nice
oh there's a mini perfume and it's the
woods agency so that's one of my
favorite perfumes a really cute travel
size love that back because it just
looks too cute and then number one for
Charlotte Tilbury in here is a travel
size of the goddess skin clay mask that
would be really good for when I go away
actually I really like this mask
especially for before doing makeup cute
still need my chocolate though I have
quite a busy out today today in town and
the first thing I'm doing is going to
Selfridges because they've got a pop-up
make your own pennyboard
stand and I actually the big long board
that I have I've like led to mark
because he's so much taller than me the
long boards work for him so I'm gonna
customize myself a little penny boards
at me and rich can I have matching penny
boards and yeah
really fun it's really good I differ a
Christmas present I think and I think
it's up in the toy floor in Selfridges
so I'm gonna go and check that out now
I've got some mean scenes I've got an
event tonight so I'm just going to stay
out in town and take my laptop with me
and probably work in the gleam office I
need to grab some breakfast before I go
the first thing I always do for a girl
is check the weather forecast see if any
umbrella the met weather app is the best
song because it literally shows you by
the hour what the weather is like so I'm
gonna be out from 11:00 so it's just
cloudy today I think great no umbrella
no frizzy hair today's Breakfast is
avocado on matzo when I break into the
Spanish things in yet been trying to
carry a cup of tea and my phone and
camera I've needed up the camera like
three times already but I'm now in town
you're gonna head sausages and see if I
can find the
personalized penny board section to
spend 48 pounds on a bra modified that
happen you're aware thighs are so
annoying
yeah I'm now heading up to the toy floor
to find the penny board oh my god the
Christmas shops open have to have a look
methane Chris has music okay I'm
freaking out my penny board I've got
these four colors to fit from and then
all these different wheels and then all
these millions of options like outside
going girly I've gone pink and then like
silver bottom things and then you pick a
sticker
it goes underneath like that I went
black wheels
all right got my skateboard pink black
wheels and the sticker it looks really
cool actually now I just have to learn
how to use it so if you want to go make
your own pony board just go
Selfridges top floor it's really cool we
just took a quick look around the
Selfridges - galleries because I really
need some shoes for weddings I don't
have any smart shoes that I actually
can't really be dancing but I couldn't
find anything today I'm just gonna have
a quick nuture answer which is your mane
I'm gonna walk to the clean office job
off my bags I've got no meetings and
things agin had by the way I've got a
new camera I've got the g7x with the
flip up screen I'm still getting used to
it so sorry things are a bit weird and
different I dropped off my bags and I do
love a good time I clap so obviously
company KC and I start to massively
inspired but they have really enjoyable
to watch so I will try and do that I can
if you're ever around the Charlotte
Street area especially around lunchtime
I'd really recommend going there is near
like talking cool Road and at the top of
Oxford Street there's so many good lunch
places my next meeting is with a brand
called Lilly a Lionel that I spoken
about before and I really like I kind of
just discovered them
and I'm going to a place on kingly
Street just behind Carnaby Street called
the urban Tea Rooms
I don't think I've ever been here before
so I'll let you know what it's like
besides to come into hmmm home his man
mentioned last minute decided to get
Christmas tree this year we have no
decorations because they're all at my
mom and dad's so hopeful device machine
and fifty ones an H&amp;amp;M home
we had a few nice ones in there but not
a massive selection I'm just gonna make
a slight
while I read it with okay I'm back in
the gleam office and I'm going to do
some work this afternoon but quickly I
thought I'd do a little because I've
popped into West and just have a look
and ended up spending so much money I
can't believe what I've just done but
pretty happy with what I got
first of all from Urban Outfitters I got
a new phone case so a marble phone case
doesn't feel like it's actually going to
save my phone if it drops on the floor
but it will look pretty now this is my
West Elm a bag first thing I got are so
much more tree decorations I found some
in H&amp;amp;M home but they weren't that nice
and I only got a few we're only gonna
get like a two maybe two three fir tree
but we still have to fill it Haven trees
aren't like full of decoration so I got
these like gold sparkling stars also we
really need some coasters because our
coffee tables glass and we keep making
such terrible marks on it and it just
when you put your glass down to be like
clunky so I got some of these really
pretty Sedona coasters
I'm gonna get one out to show you they
look like this and they've got little
eye Stoppers underneath
and I think rich will like them to the
quite masculine but those are really
really nice so I've got box so there's
uni at four we already need more than
four hope you can hear me I feel like I
can't talk too loud because I'm really
embarrassed just in case everyone in the
office can hear me doing a whole video
they were doing 30% off candles and you
know I love my campus so the first one I
got is Ivy Burch and they're they're
cameras all soy which means they burn
really nicely but this one I love the
packaging it's like a beige kind of
stone and I think they look so pretty
and it smells kind of like men's
deodorant but in a really nice fresh way
I really really like this in and then I
also this is a bit of a last-minute add
to the basket kind of thing this is one
of their three wit candles so this isn't
a gorgeous mint kind of green again will
look so pretty I'll definitely keep the
bowls once the candles burnt down use of
other things
so this one is mint Cyprus smells so
fresh so so nice I can't wait to burn
that so that's a three-way candle and it
looks like that and then two more things
a little our ornament and a little L
ornament Lilian rich I think nose would
look really pretty on the tree that's
everything I got from West Elm I kind of
showed a quick clip of why I got an H&amp;amp;M
home so you should have seen those
ornaments already I'm gonna get my
laptop out and I'm gonna start editing
this vlog Leon from the lis machines is
gonna come in and say hi to me and maybe
I'll see some other people but I'm gonna
stay here until about 6 o'clock when I
bought a germ alone at Christmas event

spontaneous haul my bank account

little spin yeah I'm just getting used
to the speed of this new chair okay I'm
