a what I eat in a day video but this
isn't just any day this was filmed on a
Sunday
I've never been a huge fan of breakfast
but I've tried to get myself into a
routine now so the first thing I do is
make the cup of tea I like to drink
English breakfast tea with skimmed milk
Oh
I usually have a couple of spoonfuls of
plain yogurts and then on top I put some
honey some blueberries some raspberries
and my favorite granola which is the
Bayona hazelnut granola it's nothing
fancy and it's not big but it keeps my
stomach full until lunchtime which is a
meal I much prefer
so for lunch we actually had a family
picnic so I wanted to make few different
things first of all my quinoa salad
which is a recipe that's been on my blog
for a few years now I start by rinsing
the quinoa to get rid of the bitter
outer coating and then I put it into a
saucepan with the measured amount of
water
I let that boil up and then turn it down
to simmer for around 12 minutes
quinoa was the only thing in this recipe
that you actually have to cook so while
that's boiling away I cut up the rest of
the ingredients and the salad is so easy
to make because it's pretty much just
preparing all the foods
I also prep the dressing and then what's
the quinoa is cooked I can combine all
of the ingredients together
so starting with the plain quinoa I then
add my flat leaf parsley and mint and I
mix that in I then going with the grated
carrots the dried cranberries and spring
onions I then add pomegranate seeds and
roasted pine nuts and a little bit of
cinnamon and new spice
I also wanted to take some crudité and
pizza bread and hummus along with me on
the picnic so I'm just cutting up some
cucumber and celery and pepper
we have this really cute picnic basket
that rich bought it's like a picnic for
two so I'm taking that along with me and
just packing that with all of my food
and drink I also bought some pineapple
and mango dessert and then for drinks
I'm taking a big tub which is a pre
spiced tomato juice that I love and
keppra some because they're fun and
remind me of being a child
turns out I didn't really need to pretty
much food because my family are crazy
and it was an epic picnic so for dinner
I'm using a recipe from the Lee machines
book I'm kind of working my way through
this book and this one I haven't done
yet it's the vegetable red Thai curry
and I start by cutting out the butternut
squash or asking rich too because I
didn't have the strength and then in a
pan I combine the coconut oil the curry
paste and the butternut squash until
fragrant I then add the aubergine and
the measured boiling hot water and let
that cook for a little while I'm going
to add the full recipe for this in the
description box so if you want to make
yourself that all the details will be
there and then adding the coconut milk
and the palm sugar and again letting
that cook and soften the lid on
you're adding the rest of the
ingredients
and it's a beautiful colorful curry
I like to serve that with rice and I
really liked it actually tastes really
fresh and like perfect for a Sunday
evening so I really hope you guys
