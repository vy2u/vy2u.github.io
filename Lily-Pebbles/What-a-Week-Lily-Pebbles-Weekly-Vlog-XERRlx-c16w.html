planning on vlogging today but then I
thought I'm actually doing quite a few
things today I'm not sure what else is
going on the rest of the week so I
thought I would vlog today and and I've
woken up feeling a little bit sad
because my doggy died yesterday she had
to be put down because we found out that
she had lymphoma which is a type of
cancer she is 13 years old so she was
quite old for its best interior but with
dogs that size they get ill really
quickly so she got ill last week and
then she whenever she gets in she just
stops eating when she stops eating she
loses so much weight tips the vet and
they just found loads of lumps and she
started getting really kind of
disorientated and it's just so mean for
dogs and they're like that so she
suddenly had to be put down yesterday
which was really sad pata since I was 16
I'm 27 now so we will feel a bit funny
today like there's just something
missing but I feel like it's next week
when we're really gonna kind of realise
that she's gone now it's all a bit it
just feels like she's up the vet I think
we're gonna have a little ceremony for
her maybe tomorrow
so today I'm doing a few different
things I'm sure you guys know by now me
and rich are gonna be moving which is
very exciting and we're not gonna be
living there until it's ready really but
there's not that much to do which is
really lucky but I am I gonna head over
there today because we're having someone
come around to measure up the windows
for possible shutters that kind of give
us a quote all that kind of boring stuff
so I'm heading there to do that and then
I'm gonna head into town because my old
University BC you want to take some
photos for me not for me they wanted
some photos of me it's kind of put
around the university things like that I
don't really know to say like Lille
Purple's went here and she started her
blog uni and I think that's really cool
as I've said before I did terribly at
school and my teachers all thought I was
gonna failed so to have my university
what kind of showed me off is very
flattering I'm very happy people help
that so I'm gonna go into town to take
some photos and then tonight me and
Richard going out for dinner with Anna
and Mark we literally just decided last
night we haven't seen them in ages
they're both up in London for the day so
that's gonna be so nice so I'll take you
guys along with me today oh I forgot to
mention that I've been nominated for a
blog loving awards which is really
exciting so I don't think I've ever been
nominated for an award maybe years ago I
definitely never won any kind of
blogging award and I just think
very exciting to be put up against like
so many good people there's really good
people in my category I'm up for best
vlogger I think I've already voted for
Anna obviously so if you guys want to
vote for me or Anna or anyone else I
will put the links down below I think
it's really fun just to take part and
vote and yeah it's really exciting just
to be a part of it okay I'm at the flat
and by the way is flat not house
everyone's like actually it was on my
house that doesn't really happen in
London I'm just having some sushi
actually break this up on the way I'm so
hungry and it's absolutely delicious so
obviously I'll show you guys the flat
ones have moved in and stuff I want to
take like before-and-after photos and
videos and all of that but I'm just here
now it's so had curry because there's
nothing in here waiting for the blinds
people to come and it's just so bright
in here during the day I love it put on
that were like blanket and the Sun
really kind of shines in here it's very
bright and happy and of it that was very
successful and I'm now going to head
into town for my photo shoot
to me again and we just I think you can
actually refer to me vlogging so I'm
showing it was after Poway vlog I think
you forgot to blog we met up with Ana
remark and in here Christina Smith and I
have the biggest blister on my foot ever
I had to walk really far and my feet
were absolutely killing me it's like an
extra toe I'm so sorry that I've been
such a failed for knocking today
especially after my like how to make a
weekly vlog video I need to like hit
myself on the head or something
today's just being a bit like all over
the place and I don't know why I have
forgotten to vlog I guess I've logged on
the weekend and then I forgot how to do
this we keep midweek once anyway no
excuse I am currently wearing Rich's
trainers and if I did not make that
clear earlier I have a blister that's
about that big it's like a huge balloon
on my little toe I just don't know what
I'm gonna do and I get home I think I
need to pop it and I'm absolutely
petrified it's so gross it was so nice
to see and remark for dinner then we
haven't seen them for so long and that's
why I forgot to vlog we were just like
chatting away didn't look at my phone
once it was really nice so I'm gonna
head home now I have nothing else to
vlog because it's been the shortest day
ever
viola vlog again some other day this
week I've really been struggling to wake
up recently in the mornings I don't know
what it is if it's the weather but it's
a real struggle and this morning I'm up
a little bit earlier for Pilates my
instructors been away for a month or
three weeks so I'm really out of
practice I should have been practicing
while she was away but I haven't so it's
gonna be really tough to get back into
it today but I'm dressed and I'm ready I
wouldn't normally wear makeup to do
Pilates but I'm gonna go straight out
afterwards well after obviously I like
to shower off my body but I haven't got
time to read you my makeup so I'm gonna
head there this morning
Tippett Pilates and then rich has the
day of work today because we have lots
of flat stuff to do you need to paint
some samples on the wall we need to go
get a sofa and we need to get a mattress
as well so like the big things we're
gonna get today and I thought I'd bring
you guys along with me
our first task of the day is to go and
find a mattress we went to there's a
huge warehouse in Essex it's like 45
minutes away baby and you basically have
to lie on lots of different dates and
pretend to sleep and see how popular
they are even going outside medium
I don't really know they're like
spring stuff I've never really thought
that much about mattress so
you might wonder why we are driving all
the way to Essex to buy a mattress when
you can buy them pretty much anywhere
that's because we know someone well
someone's recommended this place it's
like a factory and a very liberally
cheap because the mattress is really
expensive so that's why over driving all
the way statistics for a mattress we are
here in what rich is called decided to
call it mattress world that's not even
cooled that it just heard it's a place
we've got some mattresses food city beds
warehouse
my mom is said we have to both lie on
the bed and move around and if when he
moves I move it's not a good mattress
because alloys will drive you mad
so many mattresses and they all feel the
same to me
I really can't tell the difference and
the winner is no this one that one this
one 1400 pocket spring medium um
so that ended abruptly the last thing I
filmed was in a mattress warehouse in
Essex and then it ended and oh I don't
really I don't know how these things
work I've never had done it before
oh okay let me just explain from the
beginning oh we left mattress world and
Essex it's now Sunday and that was on
Friday we went to our new place and to
paint some samples on the wall and then
we were gonna go pick up my mom and then
go buy a sofa so we went to the flat and
I walked in as you saw I was in my
Mickey Mouse t-shirt greasy hair we're
having a boring errands day I walked
into the flat and I said oh this
something spilt on the floor and I
walked around the corner and they were
dried flowers and like they look like
peonies but it's not in season so I know
they were just like pink dried flowers
all along the floor and then like
twinkle lights and cushions and this
thing on the wall that I couldn't really
see what it was because I'm really blind
I was so 50 I don't understand what's
happening turned around looked at rich
and he was crying his eyes out which is
not fried in the seven years I've known
him so I was like oh my god what is
happening I got really scared straight
away I was like boy I don't understand I
kept saying to understand yeah rich
asked me to marry him easier by the way
yeah I was in complete shock I obviously
said of Corti look she said of course I
will
I didn't say yes I said of course I will
and I had no idea he has been planning
this since May so it's like he's had it
all planned I can't even explain my
friend recently got engaged she knew she
really had like a feeling that's
happening I had no idea
I thought we'd move in and then a few
months later maybe it was a complete
shock my managers knew about it because
the ad like block out the day and my
diary your anointment all these like
things had gone wrong along the way
because I was like trying to get my mom
to come along for the day and it was it
was so obviously I said oh I said that
yes oh my god I don't even know how I
meant to tell you guys because I've
never done this before but he he bought
me a amazing vintage diamond that we're
gonna go get my own ring made and at the
moment I'm wearing my grandma's
engagement ring which she gave to me
about a year ago and she said that she
wants me to have yeah it was really nice
of rich but this like reset to fit me
and feels very weird to wear a ring and
we're gonna get married this week we've
like got a new place my dog died and I
got engaged all in the same week it's
very overwhelming but we're so happy
it's the basis of it yeah
davin a Friday we had some lovely time
together we kind of went I told my
friends and told my family we had big
dinner with my family on Friday night
and we stayed in a really nice hotel in
London for the night our friends came
for drinks like my friends and family
have been so nice and so many of my
friends have just like flocked all their
plans so that we can just come and see
us and celebrate and yesterday what did
we do yesterday
tiling new kitchen and the flat like
things kind of carried her is normal but
rich family came down from Suffolk but
we saw them all day and just family
coming in and out and last night we went
out for drinks with friends it's been
mental life is such a control freak like
me this weekend did not go how I thought
I couldn't be painting today so it's now
Sunday I feel like I'm now the Shockers
worn off and I'm just really excited and
happy now
and we're having like a little barbecue
with friends we're not gonna have a big
engagement party which is having a very
kind of casual barbecue so we're gonna
go get some food this morning oh my god
I missed like the most important part of
the story the picture oh yeah so the
thing on the wall that I couldn't quite
see off that he said will you marry me
and I said course I will and he was like
go look at the picture so Richard
basically got in contact with an
illustrator and had they if he'd like
sent her a brief and had her make this
illustrators picture that says Lily will
you marry me and it basically has
illustrations of all like things that
mean to do with us I mean this is really
personal but I want to share with you
guys because you know everything else
about means them as well you have to
have me
yeah exactly so it says Lily will you
marry me and then it says joyful July
which is like hard to explain what it's
like a fun day out says the date which
is why you couldn't change it even
though my dog had just died
my grandma's ring rageh mamas which is
where we had our first date because he
come from Suffolk and he'd never heard
of wagon woman so I took him there all
these other like funny things that mean
stuff to us like Antibes and thailand
places we've loved going together eagles
Stevie Wonder Dave Taylor it's I mean
Rick was like trust you could be more
excited about a picture than you are
about a ring because I've been like
carrying this around showing everyone I
love that I can just keep it put it on
the wall and like remember it forever I
just can't believe we're gonna get
married I mean not anytime soon we need
to buy a safer first but it's so
exciting the past few days have been mad
I really can't believe it when I'm
talking to people about it I just feel
like I'm talking about someone else and
thanks for all your tweets and Instagram
comments oh my god that was all so
overwhelming I feel like for normal
people they just have to tell their
friends and family but I suddenly
thought oh gosh I guess I need to kind
of tell people on Instagram and stuff I
mean I just stopped vlogging and I
didn't wasn't really a conscious thing I
just forgot that I was vlogging that day
until now and I realized oh gosh I was
vlogging I forgot
so I hasn't felt appropriate until now
to really kind of get my camera out but
I wanted to Instagram and tweet on the
Friday night and you it was very very
sweet so thank you people have since
said such nice things new okay I have
verbal diarrhea must stop to pee now
we're gonna go to Costco and buy some
drinks and have a little partay
just a gathering just to gather any time
I need to sleep wait so it does look
like four months worth of like hype
there's always literally been deflated
the past couple of days whereas I'm like
what's that just found out about this I
hate surprises so much okay right let's
go now I've told you that bits done here
in cost
little bit distracted because they have
like older Ramsey plates and bowls we
thought actually that's pretty handy
said it was cheap we're getting millions
and drinks there's like lemonade's and
waters going on but if you've ever been
to Costco you'll know how overwhelming
it is
like a members-only kind of trade place
all right this is what we came out of
Costco is plates and bowls and then lots
of drink and random food now home to
make a big quinoa salad and we're gonna
make everything else we just got
pre-made I'm home now and we've just
finished making some food and I'm gonna
end my vlog because I keep forgetting to
vlog I'm not really with it blog wise
I'm just gonna enjoy the day we're
having friends coming around to eat some
food and drink some champagne and sorry
if this week's vlog has been short but
for obvious reasons
I will be back to vlogging normally next
week and I'm glad I could share the good
news with you guys I'm really excited
about it
and I have no idea how much wedding
stuff I'm gonna share I've literally
never done this before I'll see kind of
just how it feels at the time what feels
natural so thank you for watching and
I'll see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
