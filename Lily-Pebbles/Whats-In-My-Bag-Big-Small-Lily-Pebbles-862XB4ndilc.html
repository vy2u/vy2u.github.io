gonna be a what's in my bag and I
haven't done one of these for ages so I
thought I would do both my bags my
smaller one and my larger one and spread
it over two days so I can actually show
you what I'm carrying that day in my bag
so let's rewind to yesterday when I had
my smaller bag on me and I really hope
you enjoy it
hi it's Wednesday today and I thought I
would show you what's inside my small
handbag so you guys have probably seen
this before it's my Rebecca Minkoff bag
I can't mine but it's called but I'll
link it down below and I bought this to
myself as a treat to my birthday last
year and I absolutely love it it's
really durable like hard leather so I
know what get ruined when I'm out and
about in London and it has a long strap
so I can just wear it on my shoulder and
it's really easy and comfortable to wear
so let me show you what's inside it has
this little class 4 that opens on the
front and I thought that would be
annoying but it's actually really easy
to get used to it opens with like a
magnet and has this nice kind of blue
leopard print inside so there's a pocket
on the front which I really like this
just opens again with a magnet and
inside here I keep my krista card and I
have a whistles Oyster card holder for
those of you who don't know what an
oyster card is it's basically what we
use for the London cheap to pay for our
fare so this has black on one side and
lilac on the other and I just keep my
Oyster card in the middle there so then
inside the main part of the bag there
are two sections a front one and a back
I'm gonna start with the back and in
here I've got my phone which is the
iPhone 5s nothing much exciting there
but I've got a Kate Spade phone case I
love Kate Spade phone cases I always
find it so hard to pick one but I got
this one before Christmas and it is
quite Christmasy but I've still got it
on and I really like it also got a hand
sanitizer this is the soap &amp;amp; Glory
handmade which is my favourite one
because it doesn't smell like alcohol it
smells really nice and like perfumed and
I like to keep this on me because I go
on the tube a lot and I like to just
keep my hands clean in case I eat too
popcorn or something that I'm using my
hands for I also have my purse in the
back and I have two main purses and I
just swapped between them I'm a big one
and a small one and for when I have a
small
I used this and this is from Chanel is
the only thing from Chanel I own and
probably ever will and I got this as a
graduation present from my parents when
I finished uni and I got a first but
they were really proud of me and they
bought me this and I was over the moon I
was so happy I didn't expect to get a
present or anything like that so I was
really happy and I like the size of this
it's just so good when I'm carrying
small bags it has like two sections in
it and you can actually fit quite a lot
in this is a bit full at the moment for
the receipts but I really like this it's
like lambs leather I think and it's just
really amazing quality so in the front
pocket is I will tell you let me have a
look inside first thing I have is by
Terry Baume De Rose which is a lip balm
and I really like this at the moment
because my lips are still really sore
and this has like a nice pale pink sheen
to it I think it looks really nice on
and it tastes nice and it feels good so
I like to carry that around with me I
also have another lip product a Mac boy
bate lip balm which is just the perfect
nude lip gloss not a lip balm it's a lip
gloss and I just carry this with me
today in case I need something a little
bit fancier for my lips but I have no
lipstick on me because I just knew I
wasn't gonna wear lipstick today I also
like to carry a little mirror with me
but instead of having a compact mirror
which can sometimes be quite large I
have used one of my old Bobbi Brown
concealers and I just cleaned up cleaned
it up after I finished it and it's got a
little mirror in the lid and it's like
the perfect sized mirror for my handbag
so I just keep that in my handbag I
think I have two so one for this handbag
one for a bigger one I also have some
chewing gum extra Wrigley's Extra this
is my favorite color
chewing gum it's just the yummiest and I
also have a pen I like to be that mummy
type of person that always carries a pen
because you never know when you're gonna
need one and I don't like having to ask
people for pens I was over hairband
because my hair stresses me out and I
like to tie it up on the way home on the
tube and then I have this which I forgot
was in here this is from Charlotte
Tilbury and I think this is from
Christmas maybe or maybe Valentine's Day
and it's basically
little lips with red lipstick on that
you can just kiss like that and it will
transfer the color onto your lips so you
can only use it once I haven't used it
yet but just in case of emergency if I
need a red lipstick this is always in my
handbag and I think that's everything so
that's everything in there's quite a lot
of stuff for a small bag but it's
compact and that's why I like it it
forces me to not take the whole world
out in my handbag during the day so
that's what's in my small handbag today
and I'll see you tomorrow when I will
probably have my big handbag with me
okay so it's Thursday today and I'm
going to show you what I'm carrying in
my handbag today I'm about to go out and
I have my big bag with me here first of
all it's sorry about my lips I don't
know if you've noticed but they've
doubled in size I've had such a bad
reaction there dinner what's going on
with my lips at the moment but I look
like a fish anyway this is the bag I
have with me today
it's from Topshop I've shown it before
in a video
it's big and slouchy it's faux leather
it just carries a lot and you can hold
it like from the top handle I really
like it and when I have big bags I tend
to kind of throw a lot of stuff in and
it had some stuff in already so I don't
really know what's in here probably a
lot of random stuff but I'm just gonna
pull stuff on the bag and show you so
the first thing I have is my portable
phone charger I try to keep this on me
all the time unless I'm carrying a
really small bag because my phone tends
to just die and then I freaked out that
I have no phone on me just in case I
need to cool someone or I get lost I
don't know why I would get lost by
always carried on me I also had my
headphones today and these are quite new
actually I got these from Amazon they
are Sony and I absolutely love them
they fold up so they're really compact
and then there's sound cancelling so if
you want a plane or a train you know if
you're nervous about traveling they're
really good because you just flick the
switch and then you can't hear anything
and it's really good if you're like a
night flight I just look ridiculous now
they definitely don't look cool on me
but they're really good quality and they
were like 30 pounds which I think makes
that bad I have a random photo of my
sister and nephew in there and I guess
to go along with that I've got my
Polaroid camera and I like takes up with
me sometimes because I'm trying to kind
of take more photos this year
in capture every moment so you never
know if I've got room then I'll just
throw this in and it's a Fujifilm Instax
Mini 8 and I got this just after
Christmas and this was the only color
left but I quite like it you can that's
getting a bit grubby these are just
really good the photos come out like
this you can get wide ones as well
but I really like this I feel like it
really like captures genuine emotions
and you can't like you know when you
take a vote of someone they say oh I
don't like it retake it you can't do
that so I really like these I also have
my purse and as I said yesterday I've
got a small purse from my small bag get
a big person my big bag this one is from
you knew I got this three or four years
ago when I had Selfridges voucher and I
wanted to get something quite special
and add a bit of money to it so I got
this it wasn't all scratched up when I
got it but I knew that was gonna happen
because my friend has this purse and I
quite like that it looks quite worn so
it opens its navy blue and opens it's
kind of so many pink inside and then
it's got loads of space for cards and
stuff I love this purse I feel like I'm
gonna use this forever I also have my
sunglasses these are ray-ban Wayfarers
which I just love and I think they kind
of go with everything I've got my by
Terri lip balm which I'm not going to
used today because I just think my lips
are so sore I need to it's like a
dermatologist or something can get
proper cream I have perfume this is
Stella perfume and I don't wear this one
either time but I like to carry it in my
handbag because it's just the perfect
handbag size and I know it's not gonna
spill and it's really lightweight and I
really like the cute packaging if you
haven't tried Stella perfume before you
should it's really nice I've got a hair
clip or when I was a teenager we used to
call these Becky clips and let me know
if you know what that means
I also have my Wister card that you saw
yesterday in my whistles case I've got
my vlogging camera as well because I
think I'm going to be vlogging today and
the one I have is a canon exes 2:30 HS
and I think Zoe's zoella recommended
this one to me like a year ago or
something and so I went and got it and
I'm really happy with it I really like
it
had took me a while to get used to the
autofocus but if I'm vlogging myself I
just have to kind of hold it there press
record and wait a second to make sure it
focuses and then everything else is fine
and it's just so small and compact I
also have something I've torn out of
Grazia magazine which is the 25% off
whistles code just in case I find myself
in whistles today when I'm in town
I have some gloves these are my cashmere
gloves from masters fences I got for my
grandma for my birthday I have a hand
cream this one's new actually so I've
thrown in so I can test it out it's from
Val Ada and it's the sea buckthorn hand
cream and I gave this a go yesterday and
it's very zingy
orangey and zesty I like actually
doesn't scale the center's don't know
sea buckthorn ascent I'm not really sure
about that I also have a unique nail
file around me but it's kind of worn
down it's really do anything oh my god
I have a hair bag and I have the nail
polish that I'm wearing today I'm not
really wanting to touch up if I get
chips but I obviously threw this in
there this morning it's from L'Oreal I
think its new is the color riche and
it's been lemon meringue it looks kind
of white with a yellowy off kind of tint
and I really like it actually I have my
phone and my Kate Spade phone case that
you saw yesterday I have - little Bobby
Brown mirror this is the other one I was
talking about it's kind of lives in this
bag
I've got my small travel size and dry
shampoo in case things get a little bit
greasy and I think that's everything
it's empty quite a lot of stuff I told
you my big bags tend to kind of carry my
life in them which is why I'd like to
have a break and carry a small bag every
now and again but that's everything from
my big bag and I need to rush out now
and go into town thank you so much for
watching I really hope you enjoy seeing
what is in both of my bags don't forget
