time since I've done a what's in my bag
video I think my last one was actually
an airport edition so I haven't really
done just a general what's in my bag
video for a really long time I haven't
got a new bag
I know people normally wait till they
have a new bag to do this but I thought
I'd just show you like genuinely what's
in my everyday bag
I haven't tinkered with it I haven't put
anything in and just grabbed my bag from
upstairs and I thought I'd show you
what's inside this is my Urban
Outfitters rucksack you may have seen
this in my vlogs or in photos because
I've had it made me for about a year now
actually I picked it up and I was in
Manchester with Anna last year cotton
room when that was I really wanted a
rucksack and I love this one it's from a
brand called
or can't remember now I'm gonna put the
link below because it's still on the
Urban Outfitters website which is really
cool so if you do like it you can get it
it's black and it has a clip so it kind
of folds up and clips but you can also
clip it down so that the zip is exposed
but if you're from London
I'd recommend clipping it up I love this
I find it's so nice to have both my
hands-free I've never had a backpack
before because they were like school
bags back in the day and now they're
trendy I thought I'd give one a go and
it's really nice to have both arms free
at the moment I'm loving this one so let
me talk you through what's inside there
is a zip at the back but I don't have
anything in there and there are two zips
on the side so as you can see there I'm
gonna show you what's in there first
this side oh I have my phone I have my
Kate Spade phone case that you guys have
seen this to the hello sunshine
it's kind of broken now but I love it
because it's as a mirror on the back
which is so handy because if you need to
just lift your lipstick oh dear
should have done that before filming
then you could just look at the back of
your phone and everyone always says nice
phone case so I like that and I also
have my camera in here which has turned
itself on this is the canon s120
it's really great i really like it it's
really good quality although i find in
dim light it's not great everyone seems
to be getting the Canon g7 at the moment
which has a screen that flips up so you
can see yourself and I do like the look
of it although I find it quite large so
I was gonna buy that one but it is quite
expensive so I think I'm gonna sit back
see maybe what else comes out because I
find that a little bit bulkier the thing
I like about this one because it's so
small you can just kind of put it in
your back pocket which is great when you
are daily vlogging in the other pocket
is a hand sanitizer I think when you
live in a city you always need to carry
out a hand sanitizer on you and I'm
going on the tube and then I get for
lunch it's just so easy this one is from
the body shop it's the pink grapefruit
one everyone always says oh my god what
is that smell it's not so good I hate
that chemically alcohol smell of kind of
normal hand sanitizers I really like
this one that smells that's not so good
so it kind of encourages me to use it
more I also have my braces in here I
have a really boring white case um but I
always keep those on me okay so now into
the main part I just kind of unhook it
there and zip down and I think that
makes it feel just a little bit more
safe than a normal backpack so I'm just
gonna dig in and pull stuff out in no
particular order the first thing is my
oyster card this is in a little whistles
case that I have I really like this
thing it's very smart I also have my
glasses this case says love is blind if
I got this from Tiger I got my glasses
from Specsavers it was like a
two-for-one deal so I now have three
glasses I still don't wear them I have
one on my desk one in my car and one in
my handbag I thought it might help me
wear them more but now I always forget
or they're very dirty this is what this
palette like they're literally
Specsavers own brands they were really
affordable I think they're kind of cool
they should probably wear them more
often but I don't because I am like a
teenager these are my Bose headphones I
got these last year when I was in the
airport with rich where did we go on
holiday Greece yeah I bought these in
the airport because I had my big Sony
ones sometimes those are a bit annoying
so you can't let lean your head and I
just quite like having like any ear ones
as well but the Apple ones I hate
because you can hear when I hear people
on the tube with the Apple headphones I
actually want to punch them so these are
really good because they're just small
and they kind of if they're weak on fit
just fit in your ear nicely so I have
those and in this pouch I also have a
headphone splitter because I always have
an ax or rich or someone with me and we
always want to watch something together
or listen to something together I also
have my little memory card adapter as
well which is for my macbook air because
there's no slot for a memory card so I
put this in the little USB slot and then
I put my memory card in there and that's
why I get all my photos or videos onto
my computer I have sunglasses in here I
don't know why because there's never any
Sun in the UK but when there is everyone
just kicks themself if they have
mothered sunglasses on them because it's
like the one opportunity to wear them so
I just keep mine in my bag
time these actually new they're the
ray-ban erica's and the farm and
sunglasses shop website I really like
these they're very lightweight but I'd
really like the shape of them as well
they're tortoise shell which is kind of
different for me for sunglasses I
normally get black sunglasses like my
ray-ban Wayfarers but I thought these
are a bit softer and they kind of match
my hair color it's just a different look
and I really like them mark Anna's
boyfriend has these actually and when we
went to France together I remember
thinking those look nice I want some I
have some Wrigley's extra long lasting
flavor sweet watermelon chewing gum I
got this in America you guys in America
has some like crazy flavors or whatever
I go to America I always pick up loads
of sweet skin gum because there's such
good stuff there's only two left it's
one of those things you don't want to
take out when you're with people because
then everyone will ask for one I like to
just keep these to myself this so good
my purse is in here it is the same purse
that I've had pretty much my whole time
since I've been on YouTube it's from
Union I had a voucher to Westfield a few
years ago and I put it towards getting a
good person I knew would last forever it
didn't have a scratch on it when I
bought it but I knew it was one of those
fabrics that was gonna scratch and I
quite liked the beaten up look this is
just like packed full of crap but apart
from my cards and receipts and
everything else they keep in here I have
a little cluster of kirby grips that are
tied up with a hairband
just in case see if I have any
interesting cards in here I have my link
card because they get my eyebrows
threaded I've probably been through
about ten of these I've got two stamps
on there when you get five stamps you
get a free eyebrow thread which i think
is really good I have my boots card as
well which is probably the best loyalty
card I think in the UK this is a little
purse from forever 21 and if I'm honest
this is where I keep my tampons I don't
like to just kind of put them in my bag
to like just be because then when you
take things out one might like fling out
with it so I just keep them all in this
little purse and I also find it's less
awkward when you need to go to the
toilet I always think when you take your
whole hand back with you to the toilet
it's like so obvious it's like she's on
a period whereas if you could just put a
little wick purse in your back pocket or
something it just you know just looks
like a purse so that's what I do but now
you're all gonna know that if you ever
seen you at that purse I've also got a
little notepad this is a farm smite so
my thing
Oh sis smithson let me get some ice and
it's a little black book it says my name
on it so I think that's really cute this
is a gift from Estee Lauder
and I like to keep it with me to take
notes when I'm in meetings or if I think
of a blogpost idea or a video idea to
write it down in there or I also have
some starboard he needs a leftover from
our beauty chat live tour because we
worked on lots of trains and I just
bought is a snacks these are the trop
cords when the fan of these and that's
why I haven't finished them I think I
prefer the original flavors instead I
have a pen this is my portable phone
charger
it's from anchor it doesn't keep that
many charges I think it only does like
two or three but I just plug it into my
computer to charge at the moment my
priority is having something small over
having something that can charge a
million times because some of the ones
that can charge more of really big and I
just find my bags all really quite heavy
so I'm happy with this one for now I
have one more thing in here and that's
my little beauty bag I change this up
all the time sometimes I have a bigger
bag I got one from Tom Ford that's like
a big makeup bag sometimes I just use
the clear Muji cases at the moment I'm
just using this one which is from Erin
and this is more of like a lip stick
sized bag because I haven't got that
much stuff in there at the moment I
always tend to put more in than I
actually need so I'm trying to cut down
on that because it really does weigh
down my bag I'll usually put in the
lipstick that I'm wearing that day I
forgot that is Friday which means that
my neighbor has a leaf blower come to
her house who needs a leaf blower
seriously I'm just gonna carry on I'm
really sorry for the leaf blowing noise
in the background oh it stopped so this
is where I keep my kind of lip products
I'm just gonna dig in here started again
the toys are feeling youtuber okay so I
have my Elizabeth and James perfume in
here this is little wrong long version
of the big one I have it's like a really
nice rosy scent and I like to have a
little perfume just in case or top it up
throughout the day this I but there's a
little goodie bag recently is so cute I
think it's Givenchy I know it's girl and
it's girl and it is a tiny weeny
lipstick look at this it's insanely cute
it's Holly red lipstick I don't think I
can ever bring myself to use it but
maybe if I need to top up my red
lipstick or something like that
I just working that and my bag it's so
cute I also have a hand cream this one
is from growing Alchemist which is a new
bra
they sell it on coke beauty is quite
interesting I didn't love the skincare
that I tried but this is their vanilla
and orange peel hand cream it's a little
travel size and I really like this it
smells great I have a Tanya burr lip
gloss this one is in sparkling two drops
I just like to have a range of lipsticks
this is a nude option this is the new
one from fights beauty that I bought in
amaretto it's like a little matte cream
pencil and then I also have my bite
agave lip mask which I've used a little
bit I still haven't tried out properly
but it's a nice lip balm option I don't
have this from CRA which is new it's
part of a new kind of treatment range
which I really really like I've written
about on my blog this is their beautiful
cuticles so it's a marula oil cuticle
care just just a little brush you wind
up at the bottom like a t-shirt club and
you apply it on your cuticles I get such
drawing nails and that's why they start
breaking and flaking so I'm trying to
get better at just kind of putting oil
on my cuticles whenever I can remember
so that's it that's everything from my
handbag sorry for the leafblower at the
end there he seems to have stops now
maybe he sensed my vibes but I thought
you guys would enjoy this casual video I
love a good what's in my handbag it's a
great video to start with if you are
thinking of starting a YouTube channel
it just feels very relaxing to sit and
talk through what's in your handbag so
hope you enjoyed it come back on Sunday
at 9:30 in the morning for my next video
we're just going to be a monthly makeup
routine and it's actually the look that
I'm wearing today so if you want to see
how I did that come back and watch that
video and I'll see you guys then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
