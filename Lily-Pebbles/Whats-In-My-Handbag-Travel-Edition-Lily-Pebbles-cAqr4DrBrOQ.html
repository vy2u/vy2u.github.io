having a really good new year so far as
you guys are watching this I'm currently
in France on a skiing holiday with
riches family and I haven't been skiing
for 17 years the last time I went ski
and I was 11 I think I was alright but I
was very much a beginner so I am
terrified but hopefully I haven't broken
anything so far I'm talking to like
future Lille right now I always like to
do a what's in my bag especially when
I'm traveling because I think in my
day-to-day bag there's just really
boring stuff in there but when I'm going
away I kind of mix it up a bit and the
bag I'm showing you today is so
beautiful you can see a peak of the
color now it's from Aspen all of London
and it's there I can't remember it's
called a new link at below but it's like
something techy and I'll show you why
it's called that first of all look at
the color it is so beautiful it's like a
cobalt blue I am in love with the color
you're definitely never gonna lose this
behind that's for sure that's why I
think it's really good for traveling the
handle is quite short which can be quite
annoying because can't put on your
shoulder but I always like to just rest
it on my suitcase if I'm traveling with
a suitcase or just hold it down by my
side and it's huge you can fit so much
stuff in here it's great if you're going
on a long-haul flight the flight to
France is really short so I actually
don't have that much stuff to take with
me but I really wanted an excuse to wear
this bag it's so pretty I wish that the
hardware was goals because I'm
definitely more of a gold person than
silver but it's still gorgeous so I'm
gonna just dig in and show you what's
inside and the reason this bag is called
the tech bag or whatever it's cool is
because there's a really clever slot on
the side of the bag where a phone
charger can like stick through the hole
I'll show you here so it just sticks out
there and you can use a portable phone
charger you can tied it in the secret
pocket and then easily plug your phone
into charge and I absolutely love that
because I always need to charge my phone
especially when I'm traveling I get
really anxious about having no battery
on my phone because I have to listen to
music on takeoff and landing so that's
really important and there's loads of
cool pockets for like techy stuff
because I always travel with my laptop
and all that stuff so the first thing I
will show you is my phone charger it's
got a really cute astronaut london case
i think comes with a bag and then it's
just a morphe portable phone charger
this was okay i've never really found
like the perfect phone
this one I think there's a couple of
charges but I still always feel like I
need to charge up at my computer then I
have my phone it's just the iPhone 6
this mobile phone case was from Urban
Outfitters and I really like it but it's
completely scratching away the sides but
I'm really disappointed out because I
haven't had it for that long so really
annoying I'm probably going to switch
back to my Apple case soon and on the
back here I have this thing called that
I ring my sister got this for me for my
birthday I thought it was really weird
at first but actually it's so so good
the whole Ring idea is a bit weird like
you can hold your phone you can put all
your finger to hold your phone and it
means you won't drop your phone that's
quite handy but what I use it for most
of time is as a stand you can like lean
it that way or that way
I always watch videos when I'm kind of
do my skincare routine or when I'm doing
my makeup or just all the time basically
and it's so nice to just have a little
stand of your phone without having to
like rest it on awkward things I'm
always resting on my camera so I do
really love my little I ring I've also
got my hat in here this one I actually
got this Mizoram men's because all the
women's hats were really awful it's a
little bit too big for me but it's just
a written Sol G grey hat I also have my
lillian line of scarf I love traveling
with big scarf so I can kind of cozy up
with it our flight is was like the 6
a.m. one so we had to wake up at 3 in
the morning I'm kind of dreading it so I
will definitely be napping on the plane
with my scarf I also have my camera I'm
not really gonna be vlogging but I'm
hoping to make some kind of video out of
the holiday I'm not really sure what yet
but I always like to take my camera with
just in case this is the canon g7x I use
this throughout vlogmas and i really
like it actually it's just so good to be
able to see yourself look when you turn
it on you can see yourself that's my
light and my camera you can see all in
the screen and it makes positioning
yourself and focusing much easier I've
got my keys and then I've also got this
little black zip bag which I always
travel with it's my little essentials
bag
it's a Bose bag and this is what my
headphones came in so inside I've got my
Bose headphones and I do have the over
ear ones from Sony I really want the
Bose wireless ones but I also sometimes
find them a bit annoying because you
commonly like lean and stuff and they're
a bit big so these ones are really good
they sit in your ear really comfortably
and they have a really good sound i've
got a cable for my external hard
very boring spare battery for my camera
and then this little memory card adapter
for my computer that's my look like
techy bag it's got all the important
bits if I ever lost this I would cry and
I've also got my external hard drive
these ones are called the rugged LaCie
hard drives I think I get like the one
terabyte one I have a couple of these it
just keeps all my video footage so that
I'd have to clog my computer full I've
got my MacBook Air
I've maybe not to do much work on this
holiday it's meant to be like a relaxing
family holiday but I have to take with
me just in case I would be so panicked
if I didn't have it and I'll probably
have to do a few emails here in there
I've also got my notebook this year for
my like blogging YouTube book I've
decided to downsize because I want a
book I can just take around with me I
love my martha stewart staples one but
it's really chunky and heavy it's more
of a desk book but i like to be able to
see my kind of video schedule all the
time whenever i need to so I'm just
using this like really floppy notebook
it's from chroma stationary they do like
personalized notebooks and this one just
says LP in the bottom and it's just a
really simple lined notebook so I can
make notes in there check my video
schedules make sure everything's going
up on time when I'm away and then I've
got my little clear bag of beauty stuff
I lost my Muji clear bag I don't know
where it's gone and then when I went to
Muji they said that they stopped doing
them but then you guys on Twitter said
they haven't so I don't really know
what's going on with that but in the
meantime I'm just using a really ugly
IKEA sandwich bag but it will do the
trick it's probably too big but I
haven't I feel like that much stuff in
here I don't just put my liquids in here
I just like to have everything in one
place so I've got a hairband I've got a
mini jo Malone blackberry and babe
perfume that I got in my advent calendar
these minis are so handy I've got a
chordally mini beauty elixir which is
just nice to spritz on on the plane when
I'm traveling even when I'm on holiday I
think it'll be nice it's like a
refresher for my skin a little mini
Clarins instant light lip Perfector
these are so cute I've got this in a
Clarence
Christmas cracker I have a black biro
always good to have a pen and I've also
got a Muji mirror this is just a thin
one that flips open I broke my Chanel no
I didn't break my Chanel and I lost it
at when I went to the x-factor final it
dropped out of my pocket I'm so sad but
this is just a simple flip mirror I've
got a hand sanitizer
the sugar crush one former soap &amp;amp; Glory
rule what the smells like sweet lime and
vanilla yeah it's nice it's kind of
smells like a sweet cocktail I've put my
this works Stressless deep sleep
rollerball this it's just a rollerball
of like a really nice relaxing stress
less scent and I always take this
traveling with me I don't always use it
if I'm feeling a bit panicky on the
plane this scent insolently relaxes me
so I always carry this with me and then
I've got a couple of lip balms one for
on the slopes this is the UV stat SPF 50
Sun care lip screen high protection UVA
UVB all of that stuff so nothing fancy
but it's just good for when I'm in the
snow in the Sun and then I've also got
the Charlotte's Hill brie lick magic and
this came in the Charlotte Tilbury
advent calendar it's okay it's not like
the best lip balm I've ever used but it
smells good it smells like cocoa butter
and it's a nice small size to travel in
so I just threw that in there as well so
that's everything oh the most important
thing I forgot the most important thing
oh wait I've got a couple there's so
many pockets in this bag I keep like
missing stuff I also have my purse
obviously this is a new purse that I got
from Topshop in the sale for five pounds
I just wanted something little that I
didn't mind losing if I lost it I really
hope I don't lose my purse but it's good
to have a cheap person thing and then my
passport this is in a smartisan orange
possible cover which is really handy
because I can't really lose it if it's
bright orange and you open it up and you
can slot your passport in one side and
your boarding pass in the other although
I never have boarding passes anymore
they're always on my phone I always have
some kind of paper that I need to put in
there whether it's like my suitcase
ticket or something like that and my
passport I always think it's funny when
I watch youtubers from other countries
show their passport I'm like what is
that possible it looks weird obviously
we will have different passports this is
what a British passport looks like
you're not very pretty are they
passports so I've got that in there and
I think that's everything I need that's
the bag empty so I hope you enjoyed seen
what's in my handbag and I'll have
another video coming up on Sunday at
9:30 a.m. so please make sure you are
subscribed to my channel to see that and
as I said I'm gonna try and make a video
out of the skiing holiday I'll try and
whip something up no promises though
wish me luck on the slopes and I'll see
you guys in my neck
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
