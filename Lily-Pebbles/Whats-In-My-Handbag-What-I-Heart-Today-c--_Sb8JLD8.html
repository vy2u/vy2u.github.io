handbag video I haven't done one of
these for a while and I love watching
that so I'm gonna start my bag is from
Zara um you may have seen it in an
outfit post at my blog or I've had it
for quite a while now it basically looks
like a copy of the Prada bag and square
with a small handle and then it has like
three zips and three compartments and I
saw this in Zara and I wanted it for
ages but then they sold out by the time
I'd made up my mind and it was sold out
online and I registered to be alerted
when it came back and when it came back
online I ordered it and then it arrived
and some reason even though I had seen
it store I really didn't like it it felt
far too wide and I don't know it's
really like if I try it on so I was
going to send it back but then I saw
Sabrina from a little obsessed with bag
with things in it and it looked so
different when it was full so I went
home and packed it full and then I loved
it so I really do like this bag it's a
bit annoying this and you've got a short
handle because it's really heavy once
you have everything in it and it does
have my own but I kind of use this for
like smarter days like I've just got
back from town and this is just
everything that's in my bag from there
and yeah I use it when I want to look a
little bit smarter but I do really like
it so I'm gonna talk you through what's
inside a lot of stuff I tend to pack my
bags full unless I make a point of
taking everything out but this is just
kind of what's already in it so I'm sure
there's a lot Robert in there I'm just
going to grab what's here so I have my
hat this is my Topshop like bugging me
hat which is an essential just in case
I'm going for walks or anything I also
have this is very exciting my knee baby
this is my new iPad that I got for my
birthday app so you love it and this is
a Kate Spade case let me take it out
I've got the white one so this is the
case it's bright orange with pink inside
it says Kate Spade New York there I
really like this and this is the iPad
obviously you know
looks like on the back it says Lily
pebbles my parents got in any pebbles
and grooves on the back it's just sweet
actually someone asked me the other day
to show them what apps I have so quickly
go through with you guys well I actually
have one here I haven't had it for long
said not much just all the normal stuff
I've got a lower magazine and company
magazine on my newsstand I've got the
Zara app which I really really like I
have like a little folder called
photography where I have my Instagram
and pick stitch which is why I used to
like edit some photos sometimes I have a
little photo blog and I have blood
loving blogger pages for Facebook I
really haven't put my stuff on there I
use blog blogging to follow blog blogs
that rather than having like an app for
each blog YouTube I have Beauty lish app
which is actually really good leaders to
tell about one the list is my favorite
app for making lists I'm absolutely
obsessed with making lists Twitter
Facebook tube map is good if you live in
London and pages I bought for like $2.99
I think it's worth that if I need to
actually do some work when I'm out and
about I want to have like a proper I
don't just use the notes anyway okay
back to the bag I also have this little
clingy zipper bag and I use this for my
lip products it's very sweet and inside
I just have two lipsticks this is a
chubby stick intense roomiest rose which
I'm wearing now and this is Max plum
full which I'm absolutely loving at the
moment it's just a really pretty plum
color and really like that lipstick so
yeah those are the two that I just have
in there at the moment I kind of change
it up I always put the one I'm wearing
on the day and they're so I can top it
up unless I have it here my phone and
this is my case to ground case with all
my Instagram photos on and my Oyster
card this is like one of the holders
from the Olympics I have my ipod I don't
really use this anymore I kind of just
let use my phone but this has kind of
been here anywhere you normally only use
this what I'm going a holiday but it's
just like one of the old nanos in green
and my
phones which are not the Apple ones
absolutely hate yeah poor headphones
because you can always hear what people
are listening to it drives you mad so I
made a point of buying separate
headphones I always carry a charger on
me because my iPhone battery is just
awful it always dies towards the end of
the day so I always keep it charged on
me just in case oh I've got my Lucas
poor poor Eggman which I don't really
use as much anymore because it's the
other thing in here yes this this is
called Palma divine this is the best
stuff let's save my lips so I don't
really use this anymore and this is
always in my handbag it's huge it will
last me forever but if I do ever run out
I'm going to buy another one straight
away from cult beauty because it's
incredible so there's a couple tubes
that are in there what is this I have a
wristband oh that's from when we went to
ice bar in London and that was like a
little entry thing don't know why that's
still in there and that's everything
from that site around a little toe
buried and it's a dark rocket launcher I
don't even like so that's gonna go in
the bin yeah on the other side I have a
little mini Evian bottle I love at the
end I'm a water snob I always pick
everyone over anything else I have my
Muji gloves the ones I showed at my cool
which everyone commented I said really
handy yes I did not realise I said that
and every video I say something stupid I
have my Kiehl's ultimate strength hand
self which is literally immediately
finished I think there's a little bit in
there I kind of try to put off finishing
it I love it so much and so that's in
there I have my umbrella
this is the cap Gibson one with a nice
light blue floral print
always carry an umbrella if you live in
London you'll understand why so
unpredictable this weather and I don't
want to end up with frizzy hair
I have a pen this is a clinic pen
I have some merits glossybox Mira and
this is a really pretty pretty mirror
from Asus it has like a nice little
curve pattern thing on it I have 10
cents and herand
when did I go any weather has since I
remember maybe paris paris v derma hand
cream i always carry some kind of hand
cream on me and this is the one that's
in there at the moment really nice easy
oh I've got two hand creams maybe that's
why I'm not finishing the Kiehl's long
as I keep using this on and Stella
McCartney perfume I don't wear this
every day but I keep it my homeboy for
what I need it I haven't put your
perfume on today so that's going on I
mean nice reminds me of Jenna from
gensokyo say every time I wear it I just
feel like I smell like her another
mirror Wow three mirrors I'm not vain at
all am i I just don't clear on my bag
often enough and then in the middle
compartment which is like it there so I
keep things that I don't want to be
stolen I mean I don't any of this I've
got perfect more mouth I don't want
anything to be stolen but you never know
in London so I keep in the middle zip
like my purse this is my me me wallet
which I love love love I bought it a
year ago maybe a couple years ago and
I'm really really really happy with it
blue and pink on the inside
don't anything interesting to show you I
have my driving license I have a Topshop
voucher I have like my AAA card my
normal cause driving licence mac pro
card which is very nice I have lots of
business cards for other people I also
have my own business cards I don't
really use these anymore
but I think it's quite good to have just
something because if you end up talking
to people about your blog it's quite
nice when they say oh how am I gonna
remember the name just say yeah take a
card it's a good little tip if you're
like starting blogging definitely get
some cards are you know worth it okay
that's my purse I have my sunglasses
these are the rain band Wayfarers
that's what they're called and this is
what they look like they really don't go
with this outfit but I love them they're
so comfortable I'm really weighed with
like sunglasses and how they feel on and
I really like this ones they don't feel
like they're gonna fall off like some of
my others do I have my keys this is like
a giant hearing from juicy I didn't buy
this I think it was a gift
it's Fifi Lipan who only you like I'm
rich hate this game because it's so huge
and when he drives the card like this is
so ridiculous I had my little Marc
Jacobs keyring
which these are all the same from last
time I did this little video I think my
Barclays Boras bike key which is worth
getting if you do mean I hardly ever
ride the Boris bikes but I got this it
is on water top-up so whatever I do what
so I just dip it in and it was a
masculine child you have to worry about
all that ticket stuff because it's so
complicated I'm an MI copy anything else
in this pocket and literally I'm going
to show you I have random cards and
receipts in that pocket
I need sort of that now I think that's
everything
let me just search through to make sure
I haven't forgotten anything
nope that's all everything is empty oh
my god this bag for so much nicer when
it's empty but yeah so hope you like
seen what's in my bag I love watching
