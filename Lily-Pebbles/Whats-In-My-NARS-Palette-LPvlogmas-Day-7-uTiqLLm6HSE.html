the different sense
we're just waiting for Carly to come and
meet us so I'm taking JJ to we built the
city which is that amazing illustration
shop on Carnaby Street that I it makes
me wanna go silly and
we decided to share one Ben's cooking
but now you have to decide it on the
same 150 I know I'm beautiful
right now 23 no chocolate
we have done a little bit more shopping
and Carly's come to meet us over there
and we're gonna go to Home Slice because
I just would try to think of worth go
for lunch and I just realized that
there's another branch in Fitzroy yeah
I'm so excited pizza by the slice I'm
not gonna go for a full 22-inch for
lunch I didn't in our got them I'm gonna
get the slices I'm excited and I'm

Home Slice and look it's a choc whole
thing is chalkboard I'm gonna write
something right Lily pebbles wars ear
cream we're doing that and like here
Lily pear but this is in the Home Slice
it fits very few if any almost the
Christian Lily Purple's so I see like a
big circle around it now dear heart I'll
follow this rule it's never been so fun
I just came out of the loo and jojos
written Jojo sister with an arrow Carly
didn't think this was enough for four
people does it look how big it compared
to your face she's pregnant so it makes
sense
thank you so this one is braised brisket
with pickles on a barbecue base and this
one is pumpkin broccoli pecorino and
crispy onions I've tried this lineup
have enjoyed this one burn westerman
JoJo's never been here before
it's amazing isn't it look at this tree
I'm now home I quickly popped home but I
actually have to drive now to the
politician because I'm gonna get some
more laser done just on my face and my
mustache because you know we've got to
do these things every now and again
especially when you're filming yourself
I feel like when I look at myself a
camera
I see shadow even though in real life
may not be that bad
definitely picks up on camera more so
I'm just gonna get a little top up and
then oh god oh he's Edit tonight's blog
mas I think we didn't want to come back
I should have time I'm home and I'm a
bit panicky because it's 10 plus 5 and I
haven't even started editing the vlogs
and when it could you do that I hope it
goes up by 6:30 because you guys know I
don't like to miss a deadline it's very
important to me and then I need to pack
and wash my hair
tomorrow is the gleam Christmas party
and it's out of London so I need to pack
for a night today throw exciting and
then I'll show you guys what I bought
today as well as something else special
that I have from nars that I Instagram
today and I want to show you guys timing
is tight I've just finished editing it's
602 I'm now exporting and then please
let my internet speed be fast enough for
it to upload by 6:30 I really really
hope so I just realized that I haven't
done day 7 yet just today so it's in
here oh it's another little perfume
these are my favorite this is red roses
that's not my favorite cologne by itself
but this one is a great one for mixing
German own like pride themselves on
mixing scents and red roses mixes really
well with a lot of things that's very
cute while I'm waiting for that to
export I'll show you what I bought today
I kind of showed you this jumper in
Topshop it's a black kind of sweater
that says dear Santa I can explain and
I've seen a few people have this and I
love it it's so me it's like I have not
been good sorry
oh well I also got a comedy I bought two
Christmas jumpers which is gonna kill me
but I just saw this one in Marks and
Spencers and I fell in love it's really
soft gray sweater and then it has bills
sequins Santa's on it it's like a really
nice subtle Christmas jumper I'm gonna
wear this tomorrow I love it also
well I have you this is new from Nast
they've started doing refillable pallets
which i think is so exciting
I absolutely love NAS as a brand so it's
really nice to be able to have kind of
all your NARS products in one this is
the large one they do a small in a large
purse
I think this is too large it's like I
mean it's like a kind of book that you
take to school is huge but for makeup
artists the large one will obviously be
the preferred size so this is inside I
was very kindly given like a huge
voucher to spend so I kind of went wild
but I do have some NARS products that I
might kind of decant and put in here if
I can figure out how to do that with the
magnets now I just realized I don't
think these oh yes they say their name
on the bottom genius if you buy the
refills from NARS they say the name on
the bottom which is perfect so let me
show you I got I know the name of this
one so I don't need to get out this is
nas bronzer I'd literally in my head I
thought I said the name there it's not
nas bronzer it's Laguna bronzer that's
what I was meant to say one of my
favorite bronzers I love it
my phone is ringing and it's rich hi I
was just phoning to say if you can can
you get more of those Cadbury's things
to hang on the Christmas tree okay okay
and then I got four what basically I
wanted a highlight six I thought it's
always good in a palette to have a
highlighter let's move these about a bit
but I don't love Miss Liberty I've tried
that before it's too literary form II so
I thought I'd try alabaster but it looks
like it's gonna be far too pale for me
NARS really need a nice golden
highlighter this really isn't my kind of
highlighter shade so I might regret that
purchase but I've got four brushes NARS
blush is on my absolute fave this one I
have never tried this is a sin and it's
a really nice shade this one I think is
a more yep which is kind of a brighter
pink and then one of these is deep
throat one of them's orgasm these names
are terrible please sorry I'm over this
such a strong liking it this one's deep
throat which is one of my favorite
blushes I love it and then orgasm I've
never tried either because it's got
quite a lot of gold and shimmer in it so
I've always kind of stayed away from it
but actually it looks really lovely so
I'm looking forward to trying that I
don't know what the best way to organize
these are but I'm just gonna put them
like that for now and then I got four
other single eyeshadows this one here is
like a really pretty slightly purpley
Brown it's but it's like a chocolatey
plum and that's
in New York that's really nice and then
this one is a matte dark brown this is
called Sofia that's very pretty this is
really interesting because it's a light
it's a kind of soft matte brown but as
you can see especially in the camera is
picking up the real like olive tones in
it which i think is really interesting
this is called blonde or Jesus but
that's good for eyebrows that's probably
why it's good blonde and then this one
this is so hard to handle this is like a
taupe it's a bit like SAP Mac satin
taupe shimmery taupe and it's called
ashes to ashes this is like a lot of
people talk about that IRA shadow from
NARS I've heard it many times and then I
got a couple of the kind of Jarosz as
well I think this one's called is
alhambra I think one of them's cool is
old and one of them's called
something else hot remember they're the
two Gio's really pretty shimmery
eyeshadows I love these ones this one
especially I've been using a lot on my
on my lid so this is what the palette
looks like this is what I've put it in
it so far I don't know how I'm gonna
arrange it
how I'm gonna fill it up but for now
this is a great way to start I'll
probably put like blushes oh that's a
good way to do it I'll do like bronze
our highlight it and then blushes going
all the way down and then maybe shadows
I don't really know but I thought I
would let you guys know that this is
happening
NARS have a few freestanding stores
there's definitely one in London New
York few places around the world and if
I were you I would do it in an our store
because then you get like really good
advice as well so that's pretty damn
exciting it's 6:30 to and it's only at
38% and I'm gutted the most exciting
thing just happened and I couldn't vlog
it because I was importing the footage
but rich just came home and I was in
such a bad mood I was like my blog is
late and I have to edit tomorrow's vlog
and icepack wash my hair and I turned
around and look
yeah so whilst Lily deep in editing mode
I thought I'd hijack the camera and give
you a bit of a lowdown on one cooking
tonight it is pasta sorry really hard
tryna and in this is the tomato sauce
are making the sauce at the moment which
has caused yet onions a little bit red
wine letting that simmer simmer it down
so it becomes nice and shiny texture
it's already getting that and then we've
got spelt pasta which is really tasty I
also forgot I'm got a little basil plant
I'm growing and I've just Chuck that in
there you guys enjoy Rich's little vlog
take over there
we're just watching Hollyoaks in the
background and he's making some dinner
I'm editing his log from today because I
won't be able to uploaded tomorrow's I'm
also waking my way through the -
calendar one day three and this is so
exciting that literally I can't believe
someone so happy has made my Christmas
case any of you are wondering lily is
such a pig she had two slices of pizza
at the lunch and I was having pasta yeah
that's true because we were meant to be
having salmon but the salmon was off so
now we have no food like we're so bad at
food shopping especially this time of
year when we're out most the time anyway
cuz normally we will order food online
but we haven't done food shop in ages we
literally just have pasta so yes I am
being a pig by only had two slices of
pizza we shared that massive bond
between four of us Carly ate most of it
she's pregnant and yeah I am a pig but
it's spelt pasta right the home slice
the new one thanks rich oh my gosh it's
delicious say thank you hot sauce okay
before I pack my bag
cuz I think I might be filming a main
video it wasn't there may be I feel like
it's such a waste at hotel room when I
don't I'm gonna wash my hair and I
wanted to tell you guys actually I'll
probably mention this in my December
favorites video but I am loving using
the bumble bumble Sunday
at the moment I use it every time I wash
my hair it's the only thing that makes
my hair feel properly clean and I'm so
happy I have one in my life again so I'm
gonna get my hair a good wash have a
good shower and I'll come back to you
and show you my packing does anyone else
just like take a seat
after having a shower and washing your
hair and then half an hour later you're
still here and I'm watching YouTube
videos whoops I need to pack my bag when
I showed you what I bought earlier I
forgot to show you this hat that I got
for Marks and Spencers I really like it
I always get like a funny winter hat and
this is my choice for this year oh my
god I'm mortified
I just went to try on the dress that I
bought from Topshop awhile ago they I
haven't worn yet vital information and
it smells of Bo on my mind and also do
this is my pop dress to wear tomorrow
night smother Bo oh hey I'm just packing
all my stuff up I think I'm gonna sign
off the vlog now because I'm just gonna
pack and then go to bed but tomorrow's
vlog should be fun going to the
Christmas party and then it's a birthday
boom so my highlight of the day is
probably been having a morning shopping
and having lunch with my sisters that
was really nice very rare that it's just
us three like no kids or anyone else so
that was nice and rich said he doesn't
have a thought of the day I am looking
rough in there see you guys tomorrow
