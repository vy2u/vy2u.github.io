just wanted to apologize for the very
loud leaf blower that is just outside
that window there it's very annoying and
he doesn't seem to be stopping so I'm
gonna go ahead anyway
today's video I'm gonna be showing you
what's inside my handbag and this is a
airport aeroplane edition I think by the
time you watch this video I would have
been back from my holiday and hopefully
a little bit more times than I am now
but I went to Greece or I'm going to
Greece yeah I thought I'd show you
what's in my bag especially because I
have a new handbag and it's very special
I'll give you a sneak peek I'm going to
show you the handbag at the end of the
video so stay tuned after I've gone
through all the stuff and I will show
you my brand new handbag and talk to you
more about it so it's just a short haul
flight that I'm going on so I haven't
got any kind of face mask or skincare
routine or anything that I would use on
a long-haul flight and it's pretty easy
to pack for a short haul flight but I
thought I'd show you what's inside
anyway first thing is my laptop because
I can't pack this in my suitcase because
it would just break and this is a
MacBook Air so it's very thin and light
I actually need to get a better case for
it this one is quite bulky I might try
find one of those later but yeah really
thin like laptop I'm gonna try and not
work on holiday but I like to stick with
in case of emergencies and also it's
good if I wanna watch films on the plane
I also have a packet starburst I would
like to have some sweets or snacks on
the plane because I hate playing food
and on easyJet short haul flights you
don't even really get food anyway so I
like to have these especially they're
really good for your ears your ears pop
on takeoff and landing it's nice to have
like chewy sweets then I always get
loads of magazines for the flights I
like to read them on takeoff and landing
to distract me from being on a plane
because I'm very scared of flying these
are normally the ones I get this is
glamour which I came with a free little
Clinique mascara travel sized which is
very good say glamour company magazine
which is probably my favorite look which
I like for fashion oh can you hear the
leaf blower and Grazia which is an old
favorite of mine seriously what is the
point of a leaf blower you're just
moving the leaves from here to there
I've never understood them it should be
like a leaf vacuum not a blower so
anyway I wanted a book for holiday when
I was in Malta I read The Fault in Our
Stars by John Green so you guys
suggested that I looked at some of his
other books and I
a little read of the back of the books
but they all seemed a little bit Sh'ma
she and couples falling in love I think
I've had my fair share of that from The
Fault in Our Stars I really wanted to
read the Steve Jobs autobiography but
it's huge like too big to take a holiday
in a handbag so I picked this up which
is by Sinead variety
it's called Mad About You and I don't
know it looks like it might not be
amazing and I read the back in it seems
quite interesting so I might buy another
book at the airport as a backup in case
I don't enjoy this but I just wanted
something light and easy to read when
I'm by the pool I have my Sony
headphones with me and these are great
because they fold up so they get for
traveling they fold up like this and
then they are tangled apart and being
tangled they're really comfy to wear and
they're noise cancelling they've got
this a little bit here that you put
triple-a battery in and you can switch
on and it cancels out all the horrible
plane noise that makes me scared of
flying these are really comfy so I
always take these away with me I also
have my purse when I go on holiday I
don't like to take my big main person me
because I don't really need that much
stuff I just need my ID debit card and
some euros so this isn't there within
this little purse form at forever 21
that's nice and pineapple and watermelon
II I also have my braces if you don't
know I have clear braces I'm using a
brand called clear guide I think I'm
about halfway through my treatment now
so I might do a blog post telling you
guys all about it so if you have any
questions about braces these are like
the clear ones that slotted and just
comment down below and I will try and
answer those questions in my blog post I
have my vlogging camera I don't think
I'll actually be vlogging but I want to
take some personal pictures for me and
rich to keep from our holiday this
little case I found in tiger and I
really like it looks like a camera on
both sides and it fits my little canon
s120 perfectly inside it's been making
some funny clicking noise recently if
you watched my video with my friend
Keisha I'm sorry for the sound it was a
bit annoying with the clicking but I
think I figured out a way to stop that
now I also have my passport of course
this case is from Aspen all of London
and I really like it's very smart I also
have a headphone splitter and I think I
got this one from boots it's good
because it has one two three four five
six different slots in it so you
technically have six people listening to
the same thing it's good with me and
rich to want to watch a film together on
the plane or listen to music women by
the pool so I love a good headphone
splitter I also have my portable phone
charger this one is from anchor and I
got it from Amazon I like it because
it's really small it's literally this
size but only really lasts for like two
full charges and I feel like it runs out
very quickly and it's normally like now
it's got nothing no charge in it keep
forgetting to charge it so it's probably
not the best one to get but it's good
for size I have a pen always need a pen
just in case and then I have my
sunglasses I think for getting your
sunglasses on holidays probably like the
worst thing these are just ray-ban
Wayfarers they are very dirty and they
need to clean but they're pretty kind of
classic shape they kind of go with
everything and they're not too heavy on
the face which is something that is
really annoying I think when you're hot
on holiday
they're very comfortable to wear have my
phone of course I also have my clear bag
you always have to have a clear bag when
you go on airplanes and it's not some
muti is like the the proper size that
you're allowed in the airports so I'll
just show you what is in here nothing
drastic really but I've got some pills I
have like new phone in case I get cramps
or a headache
I have parties such as allergy pills and
if I get crazy allergies hay fever or
anything and I have quills Kells or
however you say it which the travel
sickness pills that I always take when
I'm flying
I had body shop grapefruit hand
sanitizer tissues in case anyone needs
to blow their nose a little mirror not
sure why but it's very annoying when you
need a mirror and you can't find one a
lip balm this one it's Burt's Bees and
it's the coconut and pear it's so
delicious it smells just like holiday so
that would be nice on the plane I have
my this works stress less rollerball
which I always have when I'm flying
because it makes me feel calm and smells
like a spa perixx refreshing wipes in
case you need to refresh myself or I
spill anything you never know I have my
wild fox
sleeping mask I probably won't sleep on
this flight because it's very short but
just in case this is really nice if you
want to block out all the lights and
then I have a hair band and a hair clip
for when I'm on the plane and I want my
hair out of my face
and that's everything in here so now let
me show you my handbag and if you follow
me on Twitter you see that a couple of
weeks ago of telling you guys how I'm
just I'm such a saver
not want to spend money on big things
apart from computers and cameras because
I've always had a bit of a techie thing
but I've never been one to like splash
out on really expensive have handbags or
clothes I like to save my money but I
really thought that I deserved the treat
recently and I've never bought a proper
proper designer bag before so I thought
why not I've been saving for a long time
and it's beautiful I don't know if it's
worth it I don't think it ever is but
I'm really really happy with it so this
is the bag
it's from Chloe and it's this made out
this amazing like soft leather I love
the handles because they're quite long
so you can put it over your shoulder
like this and it's a really nice shape
it's got really like soft material
inside and then it has this really nice
zip on the front that goes into a little
pouch inside so when you're holding it
like this you can put your phone or
passport anything important in there and
it'll be really easy to get to but it's
also good because then no one can reach
into your bag and take it it's beautiful
and I will look after it forever and I
think it's quite a classic shape and
obviously it's black so it will last me
forever hopefully and I can hand it down
to my daughter and I think Chloe is a
really good brand it won't kind of lose
its value or anything like that
so yes the guilt is humongous but I
think I worked hard for it and I'm
really happy I treated myself but
that'll be it for a while definitely
back to Topshop so that's everything
that's in my carry-on Airport aeroplane
bag I hope you enjoyed having a little
peek inside my handbag I love watching
what's inside my handbag videos so
hopefully you guys enjoyed this - thanks
so much for watching and I'll see you in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
