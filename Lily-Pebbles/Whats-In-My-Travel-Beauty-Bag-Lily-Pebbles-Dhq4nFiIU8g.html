previous video I am off to New York this
Thursday I'm going with one of my best
friends Gemma and another one of my best
friends Keisha actually lives out there
so I'm so excited to see her I thought I
would show you what I'm taking with me
in my travel beauty bags that includes
makeup hair skin for D I have literally
been on the hunt for the perfect kind of
beauty bag for so long and I still
haven't found it this is the one I'm
gonna be using and it's from Percy and
Reed I think it was actually designed
for haircare but it's really good you
could fit a lot in it's definitely not
perfect and I think the zips are a
little bit dodgy and a few people have
said that zips have broken I do like the
compartments but it's not perfect but
it'll do for now
I've tried really hard not to take too
much stuff I am going to New York so I
can buy a lot of stuff out there if I
don't have it I don't want to kind of
have to buy stuff so I am taking teeth
basic cetera but if I need something
else I can easily buy it and I've also
tried to bear in mind I'm going to
probably buy a lot of makeup while I'm
there so I've taken minimum amount I
think I don't know it's still a lot of
stuff it's quite heavy this but it is
quite compact so I'll show you the bag
it opens in half a bit like a briefcase
and then inside it's a clear pouch and
I'm going to using this my makeup
brushes so that's really easy to grab
the one I want at the top there's
another zip compartment and at the
bottom there's two sort of heat proof
bags so let's go through the first bag
and I'm just going to open this up as I
said the zips are a little bit kind of
delicate I'd say so for haircare I'm
going to taking with me the bumble and
bumble invisible oil range so I've got
the mini shampoo the mini conditioner
and the mini hair primer and these all
come in a set you can get them at Boots
I'm also taking a dry shampoo this one
is from collab which is Ruth Crowley's
new range I'm so so proud of her it's
amazing and this is the mini one you can
get minis in a little set and this is
the scent New York there's loads of
different scents for obviously I have to
take the New York one which says has a
fruity fragrance let's give it a go
that's really nice
it sounds a bit like DKNY perfume I also
have in here some Kobe grips and around
them I've wrapped to spare hair bands I
have my brush this is the wet brush so I
can use this one when my hair is wet to
detangle it but I'll also be using this
one when I straighten it when it's dry
because I don't
take two brushes cold beauty are going
to be selling the travel-size wet brush
soon but it didn't come out in time for
me to film this video and before I go to
New York so hopefully I'll get my hands
on one of those for my next trip I also
have to take my Bumble and Bumble semi
sumo I can't live without this my hair
just looks really boring and fluffy
without it I like to use it in the ends
to give it a bit of texture but I'm not
going to take a dry texturizing spray
with me because I really want to buy the
Oscar Blandi one when I'm there so I'm
going to leave that one at home
the last thing for hair is this from vo5
and it's nourish my shine it says
Miracle illuminator and I really like
this because it's a heat defense so you
can put it on your hair when it's dry in
the morning before you straighten it
it's not very wet product it kind of
feels a little bit silicon based so it's
quite easy to put on dry hair without
making it wet and it gives a really
gorgeous shine to the hair you can see
when you put the product in your hand
then it's got it's kind of like
illuminating cream so I've really been
enjoying using this and I'd like to take
some kind of styling product in case my
hair looks a little bit fluffy okay on
to the next bag and I think in here is
skincare yeah the first thing that's
popping out some cotton wool pads and
I've just tied them together with one of
those kind of soft hair bands I've taken
three per day because I like to use one
in the morning and sometimes two in the
evening for my eyes I don't always use
cotton wool and Bioderma which is in
here somewhere
so it is a mini Bioderma I love these
size but I bought them just in case I
don't really wanna have to buy pots and
wall that's really annoying and I can
always leave them there I don't have to
bring them home with me so yeah custom
wool and a mini Bioderma for my eyes and
for the mornings I have my toothbrush
I've actually never taken an electric
toothbrush away me before because me and
rich have always shared one so I've
always had to buy like a proper
toothbrush to take away which is always
really annoying especially now I have
braces I like to actually brush my teeth
properly all the time even when I'm on
holiday so I got another toothbrush this
one's from oral break or BRE
this one's from oral-b and it's like
crazy vibrating it kind of like I've got
quite sensitive teeth it's still a bit
of a shock I'm getting used to it but
it's really good and the charge on this
I think last 7 days it says in the
packet so I shouldn't have to take my
charger with me which is great I also
have a mini toothpaste this one's from
Colgate my deodorant this one's from
Mitchum I actually need a new one I feel
like it's runny now and I always like to
take apart if you've away with me even
though it's slightly bulky this one's
from Dipti in its philosophies but I'm
kind of nearly finished so
I figured if I finish it on holiday I
can just throw the bottle away and leave
it there but I'm going to see I wanted a
scent I can wear during the day and the
evening this one's very like fig based
so I think it's appropriate for day and
night I'm also bringing with me this
Elemis frangipani shower cream so this
is like a little shower cream gel I
always have many travel sizes like liner
on my bathroom because I always save
them when they come with like gift with
purchase or you get a free sample
I keep the more little box for when I go
on holiday and I just grab whichever one
I'm feeling at the time so I fancy a
shower cream on this trip I always have
my Venus shaver
but that's something it's on my list to
get what I'm in America they do let the
travel sized shavers which look genius
I'm definitely gonna get some of those
for skincare I wanted to keep it really
simple I have my Bioderma already but I
also wanted to bring a proper cleanser
this one's from LMS and it's their pro
collagen cleansing balm so it's a
cleansing balm but this is a tiny mini
travel size that came in like a travel
sets I think this is really great you
want between your hands it tears it to
an oil and it removes all your makeup
and leaves your skin very moisturized so
I just have a cleansing balm I also
really wanted to bring a serum because
when my skin's feeling dry that's the
thing that really helps and I hate
having dry skin so I'm going to take
with my Sara Chapman intense hydrating
booster this one's actually I think
nearly finished so I might pick up
another one just before I go away that's
definitely going to come with me and
finally a moisturizer and SPF all in one
this one's from first aid beauty and
it's their 5 on 1 face cream SPF 30 it's
just a really nice kind of simple
harmless moisturizer that has a good SPF
in it so I'll be using that in the
morning ok so these are the brushes I'm
taking with me I've tried to take as
many small travel sized brushes as I can
the first brush is from Bobbi Brown this
is their full coverage face brush I use
this for foundation I've talked about it
before it's really great and it's
perfect size for traveling for bronzer
I'm going to use this girl and brush
this came with a little travel set I
once got like years ago and I've always
kept it because it's super soft and it's
the perfect kind of small size for
traveling it slightly smaller than my
normal ones are but brush but it'll be
good for contouring or blusher I'm going
to use this Bobbi Brown face brush this
came with a shimmer brick set at
Christmas one year I kept it because
again it's great for traveling and it's
very soft but concealer there's only one
brush that I like so I have to take is
the Real Techniques setting brush
it's very skinny and thin so it wouldn't
be too heavy to travel with it's just
a little bit long I'm taking one kind of
bold lipstick with me so I wanted to
bring a lip brush just in case because
sometimes I prefer use in a brush this
was really small there and easy to throw
in it's from japonesque
and you just pull it apart and the lip
brush pops at the end and it's really
great I love this brush and then for
eyes I'm taking four which might seem
excessive but I'm going to be wearing
eye shadow every day and I just like
using different blending brushes so I'm
taking three kind of blending ones I
think they're all from zoeva yep and
also another brush from zoeva this is a
two three one luxe petit crease and this
one's great for under the eye right into
the top section and the first thing I
have in here are my straighteners these
are from ghg HD in there the periwinkle
color and obviously I can't be without
those although I need to figure out the
voltage thing and make sure they don't
blow up when I'm in America and then I
also have in this top section my makeup
bag I could have used one of these bags
for my makeup but I found it was a
little bit too big and I wanted to use
that for my body skin in hair so I've
just thrown this bag in that top zip
this my mom got for me when she was in
America I'll put the link to where it's
from down below so I wrote quite a
strict list for what I wanted to take so
there is some kind of order to this but
I'm just gonna grab whatever's here so
there might not be an order the way I
show it first of all brow products that
anastagia someone corrected me it's not
Anastasia's anastagia I just feel like
I'm pretending I'm really posh when I
say that a nostalgia brow is in dark
brown and the rmk clear brow gel but I
might try and find a clear brow gel
while I'm in America because I don't
really like this mom I'm bringing three
lip products one day one kind of medium
and one bold red so the day one is from
Dior and it's the three six three no
three five three blush absolutely love
this lipstick the one I'm wearing today
I hardly have any left of it I've had
this for years and I absolutely love it
it's just really easy moisturizing
everyday pink I'm also bringing a new
one I got from the NARS audacious range
this one is Vera Vera I think and it's
like a berry kind of pink and I think
that's really nice for during the day or
the night you can kind of build it up
for the night or put it on during the
day and dab your lips the tissue and
it's quite subtle berry and then of
course in case I want a bold red lip I
bought my Sephora lip cream which I will
definitely be buy more of when I'm there
this one is in 0-1 and really wanted to
take my Burberry foundation away with me
but the packaging is just way too heavy
in
he it's like a big glass thing so
instead I'm going to take my Charlotte
Tilbury like Towanda which is really
good packaging for traveling and I
really like this as well you can put on
with your fingers which makes putting
your makeup on really fast for concealer
I'm taking my NARS creamy radiant
concealer and my makeup forever full
cover which I will probably get another
one off when I'm in America and my
mascara of choice is the Tarte gifted
mascara I didn't want to take too many
eye products with me so I just chose to
this one for the evenings but I want
something a little bit more special and
sparkly is the by Thierry ombre black
star in misty rock and this is a really
nice kind of pink glittery just looks
really gorgeous on that on the lids I'm
also taking the white cell culture
palette in two and this is because I'd
say this is the smallest eyeshadow
palette that I have where I would wear
every single shade so they're really
nice just easy Browns I can kind of
build it up in the evening if I want a
really smokey eye or just wear this
shade here on my lids during the day and
I think this is a really good one for
traveling I am going to bring my
Charlotte Tilbury film-star bronze &amp;amp;
Glow with me because it has a contour
and highlight all in one which is really
useful but you may think it's strange
I'm also going to bring bronzer with me
my soap &amp;amp; Glory solar powder because I
find the Charlotte Tilbury contours a
little bit too cool to use all over your
face it's great for contouring but if
you just want on all over bronze during
the day I love the super glory solar
powder and it's very lightweight anyway
but blush and bring in saying this very
small lightweight and easy to travel
with is font the bomb and it's the frat
boy blush it's very kind of light
cardboard packaging is very thin and
it's very easy everyday blush I think on
this trip I'm going to be doing eyes and
lips a lot so I just wanted to bring an
easy blush I also have a mini Foundation
Prime in here I don't always use primer
but when I go away my skin can get quite
dry and therefore it just kind of drinks
up the foundation so I just brought with
me my Laura Mercier foundation primer
and this is the travel size I have my
Urban Decay primer potion to prime my
eyes I'm going to be having long days
and evening so I want my makeup to last
and for eyeliner I have my Tom Ford
black liquid eyeliner which is great
when I do want to do a liquid line maybe
in the evenings but for day I have my
Charlotte Tilbury
Verushka mink which is kind of like a
grey eyeliner I'm wearing it today and I
think it goes really nice with brown eye
shadow but if I do want to wear a brown
liner I'm also bringing my make up
forevers eyeliner into L and this
so little it doesn't really matter I can
just fit it in there okay finally just
two little kind of tools my mini
tweezerman tweezers and a little Chanel
sharpener for the eyeliners it may sound
like a lot but I actually have like one
product from each categories there's not
that much stuff because I know I'm going
to be doing a lot of shopping when I'm
there so hope you enjoyed seeing what
I'm taking with me on my trip to New
York of course if I do some shopping I
would do a big haul video for you guys
I'm going to take my camera with just in
case I film it when I'm there so thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
