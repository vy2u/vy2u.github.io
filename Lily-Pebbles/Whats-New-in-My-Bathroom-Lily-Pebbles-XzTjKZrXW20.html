I'm going to be showing you what's new
in my bathroom so some of the products
that I'm currently testing and what I
think of them so far right let's head
inside and show you what's in here as
most of you noticed i did get some color
put into my hair about a month ago maybe
some lighter parts put in towards the
end so i wanted to make sure I properly
looked after it and made sure the color
stayed as it was because I have quite
dark hair when i get my hair colored
with light a bit it tends to go a bit
orange on me so i wanted to get a purple
shampoo or conditioner so i ended up
getting the silver conditioner which is
like a purple conditioner from bleach
london which you can get from boots the
purple tones down any kind of brassy
tones or orange tones that might come
out in your hair so i've been using this
mixed with just a normal conditioner
every time i wash my hair and its really
been amazing as you can see my colors
lasted really well and it's still the
same sort of blonde that i had put in
there's no kind of brassy Orange e tones
in there so I'm really happy with this
and I didn't actually realize i bought
the conditioner i thought i bought the
shampoo but i don't really think it
matters whether you use a purple shampoo
or conditioner but this is actually
really nice nourishing conditioner as
well so i'm glad i picked this up the
next thing in my shower is the imperial
leather phone burst and this is their
luxurious body wash i really like this
because the only does it look nice in
the shower i really like the packaging
for this but it's a gel to lava so it
comes out like a gel and then kind of
foams up like a lava which means that
not only can use it as a body wash which
is really nice for a body wash it's
really kind of nourishing and
moisturizing it also doubles up as a
shaving gel which is so handy it means
you don't have to buy a separate shaving
gel so i really like this for that this
is the sweet vanilla and cherry blossom
scent which i really like it reminds me
of cherry drops the sweets i don't know
if any of you guys ever used to get
cherry jobs but they really remind me of
school so the scent of this is really
nostalgic to me apparently this one can
will last up to 40 showers so that's
really good to know because i hate
having to repurchase shower gels all the
time so this has been living in my
shower and I've really enjoyed using it
talking of shaving I yesterday went to
repurchase the shaver is it weird I'm
going to show you my shaver I think it
probably is but oh well I always use the
Venus shavers and they're my favorite
and I really like the spa breeze one at
the robot
the pink one and it has one of those
kind of funny tops were moisturizes your
legs so I've been using this with the
imperial leather shower gel and these
work really well together another thing
I like about the shavers apart from
their kind of fancy moisturizing heads
is it comes with a little sticky things
put in your shower to hold the shaver
and such a simple thing has just changed
my life because normally I end up losing
my shavers all over the place and it's
really annoying but now I just keep them
in my shower and they look nice and I
know exactly where my shaver lives the
final shower related product are these
gloves from he she--hey she's a tanning
brand which is meant to be for guys or
girl they actually do really nice hands
but these are their exfoliating gloves
and I absolutely love these it's getting
slightly sunnier in the UK and you never
really know when the sun's going to come
out but if it suddenly gets sunny I'm
always unlike overdrive like quick time
so i get these gloves are these are so
handy for exfoliating when you're in the
shower you just pop one on let me put
one on for you so they just look like
normal gloves and you can use either
just a body wash like the imperial
leather one or an exfoliator and just
use the glove and it gets of all the
like top layer of dead skin and it just
your skin feels so nice afterwards and
it's really handy i find these easier
than the kind of what they called those
like ball things you have in the shower
I always like drop those they've got
getting really messy these are so easy
just pop them on and that's it okay now
let's talk about skin care as you guys
know I've raved about the askia
cleansing gel for so long absolutely
love it it's my favorite morning time
cleanser and I realized that they also
do a cleansing balm which looks like
this it's called the perfect cleanser
and I really wanted to try that because
i love cleansing bombs i like that it
comes in achieve most cleansing balm is
coming to top and i find it really
annoying so this is really handy
packaging although you need a lot of
effort to get it out it's a really thick
formula i'm not entirely sure what i
think of this cleanser yet I'm still
giving it a go but my first kind of
impressions are there's quite a thick
bomb so I think this would work really
well on dry skin but for normal to oily
skin it does leave a bit of a film it
does take your makeup off well but even
after using a muslin cloth in water I
feel like you can still feel a bit of
product on your skin which I find a
little bit
annoying but it is really kind of
moisturizing for the skin so I'm torn
I'm not entirely sure yet I love Askia
as a brand so I'm going to keep trying
this out but so far i prefer the
cleansing gel to the cleansing balm i
recently started trying out some benefit
skincare they've actually done skincare
quite a while but I've never really been
drawn to it i think the packaging is a
little bit gimmicky for me but actually
after trying out some of this stuff it
is pretty good i really like the serum
as well but this is the dream screen SPF
45 and i have been using this I really
like like the tiny packaging it's quite
cute you have to shake it up because
it's really liquidy it's quite different
to the keels one which is more kind of
moisturizing like cream this is quite
liquidy but it does sink into the skin
quite quickly i actually really like it
i just nice to have another option for a
high SPF I've been trying out a lot of
drug store skincare products as well
recently and one of the ones I picked up
from boots when I went and bought a lot
of stuff is the Nippon fab glycolic
scrub fix so this is a chemical and a
physical scrub and what I mean by that
is it's a physical scrub it's got actual
little kind of scrubby beads in it so
you can feel your skin being exfoliated
as you use it this also got glycolic
acid in it it's actually got three
percent in so that helps with like a
chemical exfoliant as well I do like
this I feel like it's quite harsh I'm
not really used to using physical scrubs
I don't really like the feeling of kind
of scrubbing my face because it just
feels a bit too sensitive my skin didn't
react to this it didn't go red or
anything it did actually feel quite nice
afterwards I'm just not sure how much I
enjoy using it I'm still kind of giving
it a go I definitely do think it's a
good kind of drug store want to try out
because it's not too expensive and it
has got really nice ingredients in it
Nippon fab is a really nice Brian so I'm
looking forward to trying more things
from them soon and I'll let you know how
I get on with this it will probably pop
up on my blog sometime soon final
product is from LMS and it's their pro
collagen hydrogel I masks now I love
these kind of eye masks but I've never
really found any that I have fallen in
love with I always end up kind of giving
up on them but these ones I've really
been enjoying so they come like this you
get six sets in a box and you just tear
them open and then there's small kind of
masks that just sit under the eye
sockets and they feel so comfortable on
I feel like with these ones they don't
slide off a lot of them kind of end up
sliding around your
these fit really nicely under my eye and
they just kind of stayed put and I lay
on my bed and relaxed for I think it was
how long's you leave this on for maybe
20 minutes yeah and it made my under eye
area feel so moisturized and refreshed
and it may conceal it applying much
better the following day I'm not
entirely sure how much these are right
now but I will find out and pop it below
in the description bar because it's
elemis it's not going to be cheap but i
really like these and i haven't found a
drugstore turn ative these kind of eye
masks yes so let me know if you know of
any but yet i've been loving using these
and I don't want to finish the pack so I
hope you enjoyed seeing into my bathroom
and the current products that I'm
testing out and hearing what I think of
them let me know what your recent kind
of bathroom product favorites have been
recently and i'll see you guys in my
next video thanks bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
