and if you already read my blog then
you'll know about my what's on my face
posts which are blog posts where I show
you all the makeup that I'm wearing so
instead of calling and everyday makeup
tutorial I just call it what's on my
face so I thought would be a good idea
to do a video version of what's on my
face post and just show you the makeup
that I'm wearing at the moment and this
one's kind of a long wearing smokey eye
I think I'll call it it's a lot of
products that I always wear but with one
new kind of star I product that I'm
looking forward to showing you so to
start I'm going to prime the skin and to
do this I'm going to use the hourglass
veil mineral primer which is oil-free
and this is a really strange primer I
can't even explain the texture you have
to go into a store and get samples to
try it for yourself
it's really kind of silky but I don't it
comes out like a liquid when you put on
your skin it like evaporate it makes
your skin feel really smooth and it's
really hard to explain but it it's a
really nice primer so I just put this
all over the skin and then use a BB
cream and today I'm using the dual skin
nude be between which is a new one for
me and I'm absolutely in love with it
it's quite a thick texture it reminds me
of a tinted moisturizer but it's also
quite like a lot of the lighter
foundations that I have I absolutely
love the texture of it and I just buff
this into the skin using my Real
Techniques buffing brush and it leaves a
really natural flawless skin and it kind
of lets your real skin show through but
makes it look really smooth and flawless
I really like it I have a shade 0:02
which is a perfect match for me and I
just blend it all over my skin and then
if I need to I just reapply a little bit
in the places where I need more coverage
it's really easy to build and I find
using the buffing brush it's best rather
than your hands and I absolutely love
this be between I've been using it all
the time it has SPF 10 as well which is
quite good then going onto my concealer
and to start with I always use the Bobbi
Brown corrector in light bisque it's a
really good base for getting rid of any
dark circles so I just apply this under
my eye and then blend it out I then go
on top with origins plant scripture
concealer just to get rid of all my dark
circles I put it under my eye and I
my nose and on my chin and down my nose
and then I just blend it out with the
real techniques setting brush which I
really like to use a concealer then I
like to do my face before my eyes so I'm
gonna use my NARS Laguna bronzer which I
just love it gives all the color to my
face and as you can see it completely
kind of transforms the look and it takes
my pale skin to a nice kind of golden
glow and I love using knobs Laguna so I
use my Real Techniques blush a brush and
just put it kind of in the contours of
my cheek and up to my temples down my
chin and my nose and kind of all over
Italy then for blush I'm using a cream
blusher and this is a new one that I've
completely fallen in love with I wrote
about it on my blog stop at the link
below
it's the Max Factor miracle touch creamy
blush and although the packaging is
really rubbish the blusher is amazing
it's a cream plush and this is the color
soft pink take quite a bit onto my
finger and dab it onto my cheek and then
sort of Pat it in and then blend it out
using the Real Techniques contour brush
and I found this the best way to do it
so I take quite a bit on my finger pack
it on and then just blend the edges out
because I find with cream blushes they
don't really last as long so I put more
on in the morning so that our lasts
throughout the day and just blend that
out on both cheeks and I just think it
gives a really pretty pink flush really
natural color and I love the texture of
these blushes they're kind of like lip
balms they're very soft and easy to
blend so I've been loving this one
recently then for a bit of highlights
I'm just taking a bit of the soap &amp;amp;
Glory glow all out which is a says it's
a luminizing radiant face powder is
quite peachy and quite shimmery so I
don't really like to use it all over I
just use it on the tops of my cheekbones
using a little highlighter brush and I
really like this it's very subtle but
really pretty
before I go on for the eyes I just like
to groom my brows with the blink clear
brow gel and I like to brush my hair
upwards because I makeup artists once
told me that if you brush your high brow
hairs upwards it kind of lifts the whole
face so I brush them up and then some
groom them to the side and this brow gel
just keeps the hairs all in place and
doesn't leave any white bits so next
onto the eyes I'm going to be using this
star product which there's a Rimmel
product that's not actually out until
July but it's amazing and it's worth
waiting for
it's the scandalize eyeshadow paint and
this is the color rich russet
it's like a liquid eyeshadow so how I
apply it is I put a little bit on to the
eyelid and then quickly blend it out
with a brush I say quickly because it
does set really quickly it comes out
very like a thick liquid but as soon as
it set it does not budge so I blend that
out quickly all the way into the crease
all over the lid and it's a gorgeous
metallic II bronze color the reason I
love this because when it sets I am not
joking it does not budge all day it
doesn't move it doesn't crease it's the
best long-lasting eye product I've ever
ever tried hands down I'm so impressed
with it the other colors aren't amazing
this is definitely the best one in my
opinion but I really like it so I've
been using this a lot for a smoky eye
recently so I blend that all over the
lid on both eyes and then I like to just
give it a bit more dimension a bit more
warmth so I'm going to be using Mac
texture just on the crease I'm going to
take a blending brush take a little bit
of Mac texture and just blend it into
the crease so that has a nice oranjee
tone to it it's brown but it's very
orangey so I like to just blend that
into the crease and I really like the
effect it gives and I'm also taking that
under the eye as well just on top of the
scandalizes which I also put a little
bit under my eye I'm just using a
Louie's young brush to finish the smokey
eye I can't be without the brown
eyeliner and for this one I like to use
a dark brown because I just feel like it
works better than my makeup forever one
which is a bit lighter so I'm gonna be
using Mac teddy which is a really
gorgeous dark chocolate brown and just
rubbing that all over the top of the
lash line right get right into the
lashes I don't like to do too thick of a
line but I lighted it quite hard so it's
a dark line and then take a little brush
and blend it out and when I blend out my
eyeliner I like to sort of blend upwards
so it flatters my eye shape better so
I'm just blending that so that's really
soft and there's no harsh edges and it
just blends into the Rimmel eyeshadow
and doing that on both eyes and I really
like the brown smokey effect that that
gives and it's definitely kind of a
daytime look but that can also be worn
at night you can definitely smoke up
more if you want to was there going to
take a little bit of the eyeliner
underneath the eye and just blend that
out as well to finish the eyes I'm going
to be using a Laura Mercier mascara
which I got recently I've never tried a
Laura Mercier
was going for and I'm really impressed
this is just the false lash mascara and
it's really good for length it's not
amazing for volume but if you've got
quite thick lashes then this is a really
good one because it just gives crazy
length like straightaway as you can see
and yeah I really like it's got a really
big brush a bit like the origins one so
the last thing is lips and I'm going to
using a Revlon lip butter because the
eyes are quite strong so I want to keep
the lips quite natural and this is one
of the new shades and juicy papaya which
is just like a orangie peachy shade and
I just put that all over and then I
always like to blend it in with my
finger just so it's a bit more natural
and doesn't let you lip sticky so that's
it and this is the final look so I hope
you like it I seriously cannot rave
enough about that Rimmel eye shadow it's
incredible this will not move all day
now no matter what the weather is it's
amazing I'm so excited for them to come
on July and for you guys to try them so
I hope you like seeing the makeup that
I've been wearing at the moment let me
