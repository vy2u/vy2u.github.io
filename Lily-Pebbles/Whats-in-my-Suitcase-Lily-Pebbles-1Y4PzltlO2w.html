today I'm in a different location as I'm
sure you can tell I'm actually in LA at
the moment me and Anna are spending a
week out here we're going to VidCon this
weekend and we've just spent five days
beforehand enjoying LA so I'm in my
hotel room right now and I hope you've
enjoyed all my la content so far I was
trying to think about what's a film and
I thought it might be nice to do some
kind of what's in my suitcase a bit of a
play on the what's in my handbag but
showing you highlights of things I
bought with me to LA so I'm not gonna
literally talk you through my entire
suitcase but I've picked out a few style
pieces Beauty things that I want to talk
through to you guys and show you what I
bought with me so first of all let's
talk through some of the style bits I
bought with me actually first of all
let's talk about what I'm wearing
this is a place suit that I bought from
Urban Outfitters it's strappy at the top
but then it has this cold shoulder look
thing with these long sleeves that kind
of drape off your arms it's really
really comfy I find loose places like
they're so comfortable to wear I'm not
sure if this flatters me I'm just not
used to having so much kind of skin out
I don't really get this part of my body
out that often so it feels a little bit
weird but I just like the place suit
overall so I bought this recently and I
thought I'd bring it with me I'm wearing
a strapless bra with it for any of you
bigger boob girls that find it hard to
find a strapless bra I found some in
Marks and Spencers that I think of great
so I will link them down below what
they're called by the way I've had to
turn the air con off to film this video
and I'm already feeling myself like over
he is so hot in LA so so if I get bit
shiny throughout this video I also
picked up these sandals from Topshop
recently and I'm so happy I did I really
like them they very much go with the
style of this sort of play see this is
very on trend at the moment but they're
just flat plain sandals they're very
comfortable probably not so too much
walking because they are so flat but in
LA no one walks anyway they're red and
brown kind of interesting looking I
think they look more expensive than they
are they're just Topshop and I really
like them the strap goes behind your
foot so they've got quite good support I
think I bought this top near the
beginning of the year it's from Topshop
and it's a navy blue lacy cami now I
have my strapless bra I could wear it
without a new look much better because
before you could really see my bra
straps it's silky it's navy blue and it
has this really nice lace detail at the
top and bottom of the top I think this
is so nice in the summer just to wear
with jeans skinny jeans or baggy jeans
it's very simple piece that's something
I get so much wear out of I think it
looks really nice when you have a tan as
well
okay let's talk denim because I bought
quite a lot of denim pieces with me I
also bought my denim jacket from Topshop
but the two things I want to talk to you
about our denim shorts and jeans these
are both very summery so first of all
the shorts these are from Topshop I feel
like everything in this video is from
Topshop they are the girlfriend jeans I
don't know how they described them on
the website I'll link them down below
but they are high-waisted but not too
short
I hate denim shorts where you can
literally see Bob cheek hanging out no
one wants to see your bottom cheeks
these are really flattering
they're not too tight they're not too
long they're not too short they're kind
of just perfect I've got them in the
light denim wash because I think that's
more summery and more daytime
appropriate
see these are so easy to wear with a
little cami top or t-shirt or just with
your bikini and I like this fray effect
they have on the bottom as well with a
slight roll-up and jeans also from
Topshop these are the Lukas jeans and I
just bought these for the first time
they are a boyfriend fit but they're not
too baggy I'd say they're mid rise maybe
they're not too high waisted and they're
not low I can't wear low-rise jeans at
all so these are very comfortable
they're cropped as well which is a bit
weird for me I haven't worn cropped
jeans as I was a teenager but they look
nice they're slightly rolled up on the
bottom and they have ripped at the knees
and a slight rip at the top as well I
got them in the light wash I think
they're really flattering and they're
very comfortable it's a very soft
movable denim which I really appreciate
I also brought with me my swimming
costume for Marks and Spencers and this
bikini that I picked up in Victoria
Secrets a lot of you guys recommended
going to Victoria's Secrets for bikinis
and I was quite successful that should
I've got two bikinis from there and this
one's definitely my favourite it's just
the bottoms are just plain black and
then this is the top so it's black and
it's a halter neck it does up at the
back which can be quite annoying but
because they do them in bra sizes I know
that it fits me the whole today it's
really flattering and it has this really
nice like scalloped edge to it
it's underwire so it feels like a bra
and this little ruched in section of the
middle is very flattering and also what
I really like is that it comes down a
little bit lower underneath which means
that it sits really nicely I just find
this bikini to be really flattering I'm
very happy with it and I wore it
yesterday by the pool and it was great
and then I knew that we might be doing
some working out while we
here so I bought some sweaty Betty
leggings because all the leggings I have
are really long and thick so I got these
ones because they're much more like
breathable and summer friendly they have
this like breathable section at the top
and then they're multicolored and stripy
and then they also have this breathable
section at the back of the knee which is
so handy because that is where you get
extra sweaty they're also short which is
really good they come just below the
knee they're very comfy and soft and
they're not they're not that kind of
material that soaks up sweat that well
so if you are getting really sweaty they
do feel a little bit wet which is gross
but they do dry and they were very
comfortable to wear so let's go on to
the beauty bits that I bought with me
just a few highlights you know I bought
like three bags of beauty stuff with me
I always overpack some of the highlights
first of all this balm Lauria
professional this is the mythic oil dry
conditioner so it's got orange oil and
sunflower oil in it this is so nice it's
just a spray these spray onto your hair
but it conditions the hair it doesn't
like a dry shampoo that dries it out
this conditions your hair so it makes
your hair feel so so soft I love this
and when I'm away and I'm in the Sun my
hair is already so dry so it just dries
out even more and I bought this with to
protect my hair give it some like
conditioning and seriously when I use
this stuff makes my hair so incredibly
soft like I've never felt it before so
really glad I brought that with me as
well and my toothbrush I recently got a
new toothbrush from Phillips I've been
converted to an electric toothbrush for
a couple of years now it's literally
life-changing I can never go back again
but it's quite annoying when you have to
travel to take your electric toothbrush
and charger and everything Philips make
it so easy because they have this little
case that comes with the toothbrush and
it just slots in there so this is what
the main bottom toothbrush and then the
head and then to charge it the wire just
plugs into this case directly so you
just leave it in there you plug it into
your laptop and you can charge the
toothbrush like that which is so so
handy I really have been enjoying using
this I've only had it for a couple of
weeks it's got like five settings I use
the sensitive gum settings a lot because
I do have sensitive gums and I think
it's a great toothbrush so I brought
that with as well but one thing that
skin care to show you my Chanel UV
essential SPF 50
obviously bringing some cream is so
important I've got one for my body as
well but it's just like a random
salt on one but this one is so nice for
my face I really like it it doesn't
break me out it's not too heavy but it's
not so light that I feel like it's not
doing anything it is quite white but it
rubs into the skin well it's not scented
or anything it's just a really good SPF
very small and light which is good for
traveling I bought a couple of German
own perfumes as well these minis are for
my Christmas advent calendar but they do
30 mil size I've run out of all my
favorite perfumes in the 30ml but I
might get some one airport on the way
back I want my two favorite summer
scents blackberry and Bay and wood sage
and sea salt both so summery as I
haven't put any on say I'm gonna put I
wore would say Jersey so yesterday so
I'm gonna wear black Bruin Bay I smell
so nice
such a clean smell okay let's go on to
makeup and before he came out here I
tweeted asking for everyone's
recommendations for a waterproof mascara
I've tried so many and I always find
that waterproof of scars don't give me
the volume that normal mascaras do they
give me length the eyelashes feel so
natural and I like a lot of volume flow
and flow divorce actually tweeted me
saying have you tried the Too Faced
better than sex mascara in the
waterproof version and I actually
applied then yes and I didn't like it
but then I thought actually did I really
try it and I went and dug it out for my
collection somewhere gave it another go
and actually I do really like it so I
don't know why I thought that I tried it
and didn't like it but it's really good
it's actually just like the original so
much volume the brush is absolutely huge
like a big fluffy brush I'm wearing it
today
it gives loads of volume and length and
it's waterproof I haven't tested how
waterproof it is but so far I haven't
had any mascara down my face situations
and it's very hot and sweaty in LA right
now before I came I put together this
Mac palette you guys might seen it if
you follow me on snapchat I've had a lot
of messages recently saying it's not
fair that I do so much on a snapchat
because you guys don't want to have to
follow me on another platform but I
really really enjoy snapchat I just
think I like it's so instant
for example I've bought a few things in
Sephora when I was here it's not enough
to make a whole video on it and I
haven't got time and my schedule to do a
video on it so I just quickly did a
snapchat haul and I think it's really
nice to have another way to follow me in
my video form so sorry for those of you
that don't use snapchat I love it though
and I showed this palette on snapchat
last week it's one of their like square
palette
you can put the inserts in so I put in a
six I shadow pan insert and a two
blusher insert so I've bought six
eyeshadows with me all that glitters
expensive pink and the lights would wink
cork and hoax that was very well
remembered and then I have two blushes
the powder one is maca and the cream one
is vintage rose the cream blushes are a
bit smaller which is why it doesn't fit
but I think it's a really nice palette
and I've been using that on this trip
really nice I share those and stuff and
then finally I thought you might like to
see what lip products I brought with me
I'm always interested to know what lip
products people take away because you
just want to take the best ones the ones
you think I'm gonna get the most use out
of I've completely gone off red lips I
haven't worn a red lip in so long so I
didn't bring any red lip with me first
time I bought is rush by Urban Decay
really love this pink emo color they're
all very similar to each other actually
and then I bought Mac's syrup which I'm
wearing today you guys know this is my
absolute favorite MAC lipstick so easy
to wear I bought with my kylie jenner
lip kit in candy kay I haven't worn this
yet on this trip but I love it for a
long-lasting matte lip and then Chanel
Adrien which is a really beautiful very
easy to wear nude so those before lip
products I brought with me on this trip
and that everything just a little peek
into my suitcase the beauty and star
bits I brought with me and loved and
wanted to show you guys if you haven't
checked out my other la videos I will
link them up here so go check them out
