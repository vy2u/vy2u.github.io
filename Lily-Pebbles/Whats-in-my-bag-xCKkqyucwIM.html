video I got a new bag recently so I
thought this is a good way of showing
you guys my new bag which I love mmm so
I got it
in sale I've basically been saving for a
multi bag but it kills me the thought
spending about 800 pounds on a bag so I
have also been looking in the sort of
mid-range shops as well as just to see
if there's anything that I liked as much
and I went into Zhou daguan Voltaire in
Westfield and saw a bag I loved and then
my boyfriend pointed out that it was 30%
off so I got it I love it Macie looks
like this it's black really soft leather
with quite long handle it's not too long
so meat on the handle it's got like nice
light few starts looks like that it's
quite big it's got there so digging
voter written there and then it sort of
does up with a magnet so that's my back
and then I'll show you what's in it so I
have my mole skin diary
I mainly use my phone for my personal
diary but I use this for my blocks of
writing down ideas monthly favorites so
if I receive any packages when I receive
them so I know so I keep that all in
here it's a big size really like it I've
got my phone which is new my new white
iPhone 4s which I love and nice picture
of me and my boyfriend on there I've got
my oyster card which I keep in glossy
box Oyster card thing and I actually
carry my phone charger army which is
really weird but because iPhone battery
dies really quickly and I don't want to
be without a phone so just in case I
carry that on me my keys
so I've got a Marc Jacobs keyring which
I actually got from the market by market
flip store in town sort of near Bond
Street it's about three pounds it's the
best shot everything's really cheap and
it's quite quite like it oh and I have
my Barkley bikes key for the London
bikes versus in here I have my Tresemme
mini dry shampoo which is probably quite
gross oh good I don't have that greasy
hair but you never know if you need it
and it's only smaller so I carry that
around as well my purse which is my nimi
purse I love it it's so got really
scratched but I quite like that effect I
may be playing opening itself right to
cut it inside and I keep all my cards
money I also got my business cards like
that just in case for everything in
there it's really packed full I have my
Kindle which I read every morning on the
tube and on the way back from work and I
can't remember what immediate moment I
find with the Kindle it's really hard to
know the name of the book because it
doesn't say it unless you go to the home
page before I go to sleep it's good it's
very good so that's my Kindle nice and
thin and weighs absolutely nothing I
always think it's gonna blow away
whenever the tube goes fast and then I
have my headphones for my phone which I
listen to my music on my phone mr. time
and I don't use the apple headphones
because I hate them in here everything
when someone's wearing them on the tube
which drives me mad and they hurt my ear
so I used these which have like this
sort of thing like that that goes in and
then I'm all the bits are on my back I
used to just let bits farm everywhere
and it was really messy but then I
copied my friends idea and for Christmas
my boyfriend bought me a shower gel and
a body lotion from
TV became in this pretty cute little
Hudson bag so I use this to keep all the
bits that fly around my back inside so
it's looks like that
yes you got me the Philosopher's body
lotion and shower gel really nice in
here
makes me really really weird but have
candy whites like a moment ago
I'm not a mom by the way I've had you
watched just in case you never know
I have hand cream which is are born fc5
hand cream which is nearly finished but
I really like that hair clips just in
case um hands drive me mad this is the
EOS lip-balm
which is like this which is really nice
you just know that watermelon mmm
I have a little mirror like this I have
my dip teak rollable perfume so that
comes like that's first circus so don't
let's carry my whole perfume around with
maybe this like you just top up it
smells so good
it's fake so I just keep that in there
and last I have I've got one of my
Revlon lip butters this is the very
smooth one it's really nice if I want to
put this lip color on and so I nobody
carry much makeup around me just got two
lip things with me this is one of my new
MAC lipsticks this is syrup which looks
like that
she was gonna wear in this video but I
forgot but it's really nice and then
I've got about ten curvy grips as well I
would never leave the house without
these I need them they're like me
Savior so I have lots of those on me as
well and I keep them all in this bag I
think that's it yes my bag is empty now
so that's everything I carry around oh
and my camera but I'm using my thumb
right now so obviously I'll show you
that I always carry my camera around
with me so that's all hope you enjoyed
it and let me know if you have a video
of what's in your bag
post underneath I'd love to see it I
hope you enjoyed it thanks bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
