and i have a morning voice on I'm not
hung over but like I'm not gonna lie of
a little bit of a wine headache so I
even just like two glasses of wine gives
you that sort of like wine eight on the
side of your head but I am ready to go
out there's a breakfast I think I'm
going me at come two people down there
rich already had his breakfast because
he woke up early to do some work morning
yeah so I'm gonna go meet some other
peeps down for breakfast and rich has
already pre warned me that it's meant to
be amazing boiled eggs with smiley faces
on or something like that um so I'm
gonna go out there and find everyone now
and I'm hungry bye rich wasn't lying
about the exits mighty faces on them
it's really weird
breakfast was really nice I'm so tired
though I didn't really look because I
think it's just so awkward vlogging when
you're around that many like other
vloggers it's just too many cameras and
awkwardness but I'm gonna go get my
laptop and see how rich is doing and
then there are stairs to edit is this
long
okay just got back to the room and I
didn't think I'm actually gonna go
downstairs to work because rich needs to
head home wings to head to work so I'll
just have to edit when I get home okay
home time work time
yeah I just got home and it's half 11:00
and I'm just gonna get strands editing
from putting of a panicky about the fact
that I haven't even edited my vlog or
uploaded or anything for tonight
normally I've done it the night before
so I'm gonna do that now and make sure
everything is just done and then I can
carry on with the rest of my day okay
it's a couple of hours later and I'm
still sitting here editing and something
my external hard drive unplugged
accidentally so then loads of my files I
was editing said like missing files so
I'd like rien port the moorland there's
better pain but I'm now just uploaded to
YouTube and fill in in the description
box and I think I've also just had an
idea for my Nia's Eve video I think my
makeup - I might be a bit boring I
thought I'd lots of other people are
gonna do that so I've thought of a
different idea I'm not going to tell you
except I want to ruin it
but it's gonna be more of like a
difficult one to like edit and stuff a
bit kind of fancy and fun so I'm just
gonna plan it out now in my head and
like write it down at my phone which is
why I usually do okay video uploaded
description box thumb tweets Facebook
scheduled it's actually dark outside now
I realized that it's now 3:00 o'clock
gonna have them eaten since breakfast so
I'm gonna go and make some kind of food
but I haven't had today's I've been
calendar 17
we're not very good at finding them here
you go it's just the perfect amount of
chocolate we're gonna make myself some
spelt penne and I know it's really weird
but I've been eating in my whole life my
arm used to make it for me when I was
ill off school but my favorite kind of
like comfort food like I'm a little bit
hungover so I'm feeling a bit sensitive
um is pasta with ketchup and Parmesan
and I know that sounds disgusting but
it's not it's amazing
Emilie's have been upstairs yet since I
got back this morning I've just I don't
even know I've just been editing I've
just realized that what I supposed to
open so I'm going to do that and then I
think of my trap which is a stocking
present okay I'm gonna wrap rich
stocking presents now because they've
been sitting at the end of our bed for
so long in oliver bones Baggins getting
really annoyed that he knows are there
and he's not looking and I'm not making
any effort to help them when he's like
hidden mine all over the house so I'm
gonna wrap those whilst watching in the
second half of the Ed Sheeran
documentary on YouTube because I started
what you think yesterday morning when I
was waiting for Anna to arrive and I
didn't finish it and it was amazing so I
definitely want to finish watching that
I'll leave the link to that down below
by the way if you want to watch it cuz
it's really good if you like Ed Sheeran
it's a good documentary it's weird cuz I
have loads of work stuff to do but I
just I'm such a night owl like I keep
saying I'll do it I'll do it later
because I just know in the evening I'm
gonna be way more in the mood for like
working
it's just weird I don't know what it is
that my body just wants to work at night
so we wrap now and then do work
okay it's a little bit later now and
I've wrapped up which is president and a
couple of others as well and now I
really need to tackle my suitcase
because it's like four o'clock now and I
haven't unpacked yet it's just a big fat
mess and so we're gonna do that now just
tidying up my desk area because there's
makeup everywhere and I wanted to show
you guys I've got some new Tanya burr
lip glosses together these four okay so
this one is I found Nemo which has the
cutest name ever
this one is Aphrodite this one which
looks black bitten oh I can't read that
black writing on a dark lip gloss
this one is sparkling Dew drops then I
think I've got berry one as well this is
my handbag some of these I haven't tried
yet I love tiny about lip glosses so
looking forward to trying some new
shades I forgot to say that I was
actually meant to be going to the lush
bar today I was taking my mom for her
birthday but obviously I couldn't go
because I wouldn't be back in time from
the Christmas party and I didn't know
that was happening I didn't want her to
miss out so instead my auntie went with
her and they went into the lush spa on
Kings Road and had a treatment called
hard day's night which is it's quite
cool I think I've talked about it when I
was there they used like ribbons to
re-enact own like Cirque du Soleil
because all the music is like beetles
that's why I've called hard day's night
and it's pretty amazing and you get
heated pajamas and slippers to wear so
she's not back yet but I'm really
looking forward to hearing and how it
went and she loves going for spa so I
hope they both enjoyed it yeah somehow
found myself at my desk it's 10:00 to
5:00 so I will it be here for a couple
of hours just catching up on everything
I'm just reading through some of the
comments from yesterday's vlog because I
didn't have time while I was at the
hotel a lot of you guys are commenting
about printing photos obviously I know
that printing online is much cheaper the
only reason I printed boots because
normally it's like I need them to do my
scrapbook straightaway and I when you do
them online always takes so long to come
by that point I'll probably can't bother
the scrapbook anymore so it's just like
when I want to print them or print them
that's why I usually print them away
over
it's good well I'm really surprised I
just tweeted you guys asking if you'd
prefer my 2014 favorites to be just
might like all my favorites from the
year or if you want like a Hall of Fame
where it's like favorite primer favorite
foundation favorite lipstick and you're
pretty much all of us a Hall of Fame
which I'm really surprised because I
don't know if that's the one that I
prefer to watch just because SATA like I
might not even have a favorite primer
actually I don't have a favorite primer
from this year because I haven't used
primer so it's a bit of a weird one and
I like to know what you guys think and a
lot of you saying Hall of Fame so I have
to think about that one let me know what
you guys would prefer on here cuz you
might not be on Twitter okay it's 7
o'clock now and I'm still at my desk but
I think I'm gonna go downstairs because
it's not good to be sitting in a desk
I'm gonna take my laptop downstairs with
me carry on but at least I can sit on
the sofa and see my family
I thought I'd do a quick little what's
on my iPhone click because I haven't
done much today and a lot of people
always ask me to show what's on my
iPhone and I think it was Tanya bird
that actually said in real life like you
should do what's an iPhone because the
happy parking app that I mentioned in
another vlog family useful so I'm gonna
do that now for you and show you like
everything that's on my phone so I'm
going to start at the top and this up
here is Caxton FX this is a card that I
use when I'm traveling basically means
you don't get charged to spend money
abroad and the app that comes with it's
really good because you can check your
balance when you're away the second app
I have here is the YouTube creator
studio app and this is if your content
creator on YouTube you can get this lit
up here this is what I use to check my
comments and my analytics and I can edit
videos on here it kind of has everything
you need in one place then I've got my
vodafone app which just shows me my
phone bill and my usage etc and then I
have my YouTube app which is where I
watch all my videos and subscriptions
and check out my own videos I then have
my calendar which I live by everything
is at my calendar I literally cannot
live it disappeared recently and I
thought the world is gonna end but I got
it back then I have my clock which I
used for my alarms I have the earliest I
have this 4 a.m. I must be getting a
flight and the latest I have is 1 p.m. I
must have been napping after a long
flight I think got my settings and notes
I use notes a lot for making notes on
blog posts
writing lists to-do lists I have like
Wi-Fi passwords it's just kind of my
everything in there then I had Google
Maps I much prefer Google Maps to the
maps that come on the iPhone I find it's
so easy to use like a sat-nav I use it
when I'm driving when I'm walking it's
really really handy and then I have the
Met Office app which shows me the
weather and this one's good because it
shows you the weather kind of by the
hour and then have photos and whatsapp
which I use a lot to chat to my friends
to I don't really know why because I
have three messages but what's up
you can send photos and stuff and it's
really quick and instant that's what I
like I've then got the Facebook mentions
app which I think it's not probably out
yet but Facebook allowed me to use it
early and it's basically if you have a
Facebook page it's an easy way for me to
kind of manage my page check comments
when you guys reply to comments here's
my page here and it's just like I kind
of see everything in one place and I
know that I won't be commenting as for
my personal page then I have Facebook
there which is just the standard app
where I use for my personal Facebook and
Safari for internet and then Facebook
Messenger
which I really hate you have to do that
set for it it's very annoying but I have
that because I have to do and then got
the uber app although I'm not massive
fan of uber and I don't really use it
that often but it's there in case
because I once had to use it and then
this is just a link to my website just
so I could check the blog prices have
gone up every day I then have my camera
and my Instagram I ignore mele take
photos on camera mode on square and then
I'm editing upload to Instagram I don't
take them on Instagram I'm not sure why
I think it's because I don't want to
lose them or it's just a kind of habit
down at the bottom the four most
important ones I just have messages
phone Twitter and I eat the Gmail app
instead of the Apple app because I've
never completed but it's easier for me
then up here I have photography in there
I've got pic junto which joins pictures
to get together party party which I
don't really use but I bought it just to
like support a beautiful mess and also
their their original app vsco cam which
I used to edit photos on Instagram and -
lapse which like speeds up photos and
makes a little video I've actually done
a blog post on how I like to edit my
Instagram so I will link that down below
in music I've just got my music iTunes
and Spotify actually recently started
using specify and I really like it and
then business I've just got kind of bank
accounts PayPal boring things like that
and then general this all the stuff that
I just don't use it comes with the
iPhone you can't delete then utilities
again more things that I don't use and
then I've got the chromecast app because
I have a chromecast linked to my TV
downstairs which is basically something
you could plug into the back of your TV
to watch youtube videos on your TV
I had the pasaba app which is like one
of my favorite restaurants and their app
is really good you can pay on the app
and it's really quick and easy
I have calculator in travel I've got my
tube map because I was looking at this
one's quite good because it can show you
like the quickest route and then I've
got the normal maps I don't use a P
parking which is what I was talking
about earlier this shows you like where
you can a Compaq in London and then it
British Airways app because sometimes I
fly with them contacts heads-up which is
like my favorite favorite game I don't
have any other games on my phone
this is Ellen DeGeneres this game and
it's like charades and accents and you
hold up to your head is basically a
hilarious game FaceTime blog loving I
don't really use the app as much because
I prefer just looking it on my laptop of
blogs but I do have it there an app
store and timehop which is a hilarious
new app that I started using that
basically shows you old Facebook
Instagram and Twitter posts from like
two three four five years ago and it's
hilarious and that's it I don't really
like to overcrowd my phone so there's
not that much on it I think looking at
my phone is incredibly boring but a lot
of you guys have asked for it and I know
that's kind of interesting having a peek
into someone's phone so maybe found like
one or two interesting apps than that so
I'm gonna head downstairs now with my
laptop and chill out with a TV and eat
some dinner yummy soup for dinner okay
I've seen it loads of you guys have
commented asking for rich to give a
proper tea tutorial and I will get him
to do that in another blog he's out
another Christmas party tonight but in
the meantime I'll show you how I make it
tea kiss it's pretty similar we always
use a filter I'm not sure why I think
it's just because always the kettle gets
all like lime scaly so
if this is full which never is I just
fill up the capsule so I'm making tea
for me and my mom I like to have English
breakfast tea and she drinks it all
great I think everyone in my family a
floppy matrix L very okay next step is
obviously to pour the water room I think
the key to a good cup of tea is letting
another time key a key to a good cup of
tea it's letting it sit for a couple of
minutes before you do anything else so
I'm gonna let that sit I'm desperate to
take these stars of my nails so I'm
gonna run upstairs to get some nail
polish remover here now it's been
sitting for a couple of minutes I like
to give it good squeeze I like my tea to
be quite strong but then I have a lot of
milk in it so like the actual tea bag I
want it to be strained a lot but then
with quite a lot of milk and really
shouldn't be using the same spoon
because different tea now we use skimmed
milk in our house not for any particular
reason just because we always have and
now I'm used to the taste so anything
else it tastes like cream to me so oh
great always go is a really weird funny
color
my mom just likes a little bit of milk
and it always looks horrible that's kind
of how she likes it I like quite a lot
of milk and my team like that so that's
definitely not the best way of making
tea that's just my way but I'll try and
get rich to give you guys a proper rich
tea tutorial if you're not English and
you find this whole English tea thing
fascinating then let me know what you'd
like him to show you and I'll get him to
show you next time he makes tea all
right I'm removing the stars I'm having
to wrap my nails in foil and I think I'm
going to leave it on for about 20
minutes for the Stuart riches back and
you're not freezing well or you know
sore throat headache what are you making
honey and when I make you be poor you
know while you're that I think we're
gonna end States look now you're just
gonna go to bed and I'll see you guys
tomorrow
but going to start it now something
stuff see you guys tomorrow you've
