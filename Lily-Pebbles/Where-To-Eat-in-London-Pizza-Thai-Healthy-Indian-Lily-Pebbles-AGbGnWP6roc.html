this video is a little bit different and
I know it's quite specific so a lot of
people won't love it but for those of
you who are either from London or
traveling to London planning a trip I
thought this could be really handy you
guys know that I love food I love et now
and try new restaurants so for today's
video I want to talk through some of my
favorite places to eat out in London
I've tried not to include like two niche
places these are a little bit Cheney so
I feel like Londoners would be like why
are you talking about these places
there's so many cool like little
restaurants but for the first video and
this kind of thing I wanted to do places
that are easy to get to and there's a
few scattered around London they're all
so so good though I eat it all of them
regularly and I can't wait to tell you
about them so let me start with the
first one assume have quite a few
branches around London and the idea is
it's based on the old traditional cafes
in Bombay Indian food I feel like in
London has a really bad tradition of
just being too cliche I feel like we've
ruined it with our kind of pub football
lifestyle and assume is the first Indian
kind of big chain restaurant has brought
true Indian food back and it's
incredible the atmosphere is amazing one
thing to know is you do have to queue
they have this insane queueing system
where they always make you queue and
they take your name but they do give you
hot drinks while you wait and it's never
as long as they say it's going to be
they always say it's gonna be two hours
and you end up waiting like 20 minutes
but it is really worth the wait and I
always try to go like off-peak so in the
afternoon for like early dinner just
don't go on like a Friday night for
dinner because you will have to queue I
do like how the system works so they
take your name down they give you a hot
drink and they invite you in they
welcome you with your name that's
already on the iPad and then they took
us downstairs to the bar for a drink
we did have to wait down there for quite
a long time but we had a nice drink and
just enjoyed ourselves
eventually we sat at our table and the
whole restaurant is just amazing to look
around there's so much to look at the
decor is incredible the toilets even
feel like quite authentic and the food
is just amazing it's very much like you
can share if you're into sharing I think
that's the best thing to do this kind of
restaurant order lots of small dishes
and share with whoever you
all eating with a lot of food is quite
spicy so if you don't like spicy food
definitely ask your waiter to have it
non spicy but we got like a couple of
chicken dishes a couple of rice dishes
some nons
some dolls and I absolutely love the
food I really like the dish I'm in Kings
Cross I think that's the really good one
and the waiters and waitresses are all
really friendly it's definitely an
interesting one to try if you do like
Indian food
I mean don't expect to go there and get
calmer and peel our ice like it's not
that kind of India and it's interesting
be open-minded to try new things and ask
your waiter for what they recommend I
always think that's the best thing to do
the detox kitchen is quite a new and
trendy one it was started by a girl
called Lily
I think and maybe her her boyfriend or
husband I probably shoulda done my
research first but I went to the launch
there was one is one in kingly core but
now there's also one near good Street as
well which is the one I filmed in and
it's slightly bigger the details kitchen
is just the best place to go for a
healthy lunch it's not cheap be warned
it's definitely not cheap you can get
like a small medium or large box and
there's amazing different kind of Middle
Eastern healthy salads there's like
baked aubergine pomegranates quinoa
salads like healthy slaws well so is
there like sweet potato butternut squash
all different salads and you can just
like fill your box you pick a protein
like chicken or fish and then you add
like two or three salads along with it
they've got loads of different healthy
juices nice coffee and it's a really
positive happy environment as well they
do like yoga classes downstairs and it's
always pretty busy at lunch it's right
underneath Estee Lauder offices so try
again and go like off-peak but it's such
a good way to have like a healthy meal
and so much to pick from it's really
exciting I really shouldn't be filming
this video what I haven't had lunch yet
it's just making me like salivate I'm so
hungry but it's really nice to support
like new young businesses and I think
they're doing really well the cookbook
is also really good I've got that and I
use it quite a lot
Grainne drunko is a new one for me I've
only tried it recently but I thought it
was definitely quite interesting I
didn't have the best experience in terms
of like the waiters like the one I had
was really quite rude we were waiting
for a long
the table but there wasn't like a
designated waiting area so we really
just felt in the way which was awkward
but all that aside the food was really
great it's really interesting like it's
an Australian company but it's
definitely got a lot of like Asian
influence in it so you can go there for
brunch but then there's like rice and
egg dishes that you'd have for brunch
really interesting food definitely check
out the menu for all of these places I'm
going to link all the restaurants down
below in the description box grain Junko
is a good one to go for brunch or lunch
but I think all of these places do every
meal I mean - oome also does breakfast
which is so interesting and I loved it
you get like a naan wrap so it's like an
egg and bacon naan wrap anyway I love
the shoe Grainger unko the food was
really good they do really good hot
chocolate as well definitely one to go
and check out if you watch my vlogs
you'll definitely know about besar berry
Thai because I'm there all the time Thai
is definitely one of my favorite types
of food and I think they do Thai on a
big scale very well it's not like a
Chinese takeaway it's like really good
quality Thai food the flavors are all
there it's so authentic I've been to
Thailand quite a few times so I know
that it's really authentic Thai food I
absolutely love the deep-fried prawns I
love the pad thai it's so delicious
everything that I've tried there I
really liked they do big like square
tables that you share so it's quite nice
to go with a big group of friends they
are everywhere there's branches
everywhere and it all pretty much the
same so there isn't like one I would
recommend over the other but if you're
into Thai food that's definitely the
place to go and I would recommend it
over wagamama I think it's more
authentic and less like I do like
wagamama but why Guam is a bit of a
factory they just like churn out the
same things because I feel like cassava
has a bit more love and authenticity in
it finally home slice again another one
you'll know if you watch my vlogs this
is the place that I would recommend for
pizza in London
the first budget was Covent Garden but
they've got a few others now and they do
22 inch pizzas so that's a huge pizza
that you can either split down the
middle and get two different toppings
and share with someone or you can buy
the pizzas by the slice which is great
especially if you want it for like
takeaway for lunch every topping I've
tried has been amazing
and they're so interesting it's not like
pepperoni or vegetables it's like goats
cheese and think or like some of them
have really interesting bass instead of
tomato like really different pizza
toppings and they're so delicious the
pizza the bass is amazing you don't
leave there feeling like you're full and
you've been like really naughty and had
like a really unhealthy Pizza it's just
such good quality stuff really cool like
vibe in there very relaxed nice to go
for like a Friday night dinner or just
for lunch
none of these restaurants are
particularly posh actually none of them
are I've told the team is probably the
most like sit-down one but they're all
very casual you can have lunch or dinner
there and none of them are crazy
expensive detox kitchen is quite
expensive for what it is but all of
these restaurants are like mid-range so
I'm going to link below all of the
restaurants that I've spoken about and
I'm also going to write a little bit
about what I think of each one just in
case I forgot to say anything and the
dishes that I would recommend buying
each one is basically going to be a lot
of info down there so go and check out
the description box if you haven't done
that yet if you haven't seen my last
video I will link it here so go ahead
and have a watch of that and if you
