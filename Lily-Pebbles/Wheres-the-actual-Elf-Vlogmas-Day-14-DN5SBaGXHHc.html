Greenbury to meet Anna mark Tonya and
Jim whenever I say Tonya Jim I just want
to say where's the engine Rosie and Jim
every time I have the most painful
period pains I feel like I can say that
because half the population knows what
I'm talking about and 98.9% of you guys
watching Oh women so it's fine I can say
that it's very painful I need to take
some of your faith and then we're off
I'm looking forward to having a soup I
think a sweet potato and chorizo fritter

egg what are you gonna have also really
need a good warm cup of tea my coke

I'm just reading through your comments
and they're so nice I'm so glad you guys
enjoyed it it took a long time to film
and edit as you guys saw in the vlog
ever though he's at low that wasn't
English there were loads of comments of
you guys saying I could see the string
it was really funny because if I wasn't
blogging you wouldn't know about things
like that bike I like that so I'm glad
you guys enjoyed the video and it came
out right I was quite happy with it I
could have done it
if it wasn't blogging every day but it
was the best I could do at the time
okay I think Ana remark running a bit
late but Tania and Jim said they'll be
here on time so let's go find them I
think is giving hilarious me for
youtubers one breakfast place they're
not gonna know what hit them or gonna be
getting our cameras out with five
seconds I always think it looks so funny
when there's more than one vlog or in
one place news Greenbury

I'm getting a tea and now they're a
little bit late but we pre ordered their
food soon thanks Chuck shook up this is
mine the treats and sleep rate of return

stars as well and like this el
