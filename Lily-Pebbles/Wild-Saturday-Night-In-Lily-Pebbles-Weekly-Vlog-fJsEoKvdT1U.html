did a blog all week because I don't
really have anything to blog so thought
I'd wait to the weekend but actually we
haven't really got that much going on
this weekend either so this is gonna be
one of those like normal I think that
exciting happens vlog oh my god I'm
acting really weird because I've woken
up with the most sore neck I'm one of
those people that's always prone to
likes pulling their muscle in my neck or
hurting my back I always have been since
I was like really young and I've just
woken up this morning and I can't like
turn my head which is really annoying
because I have stuff to do today that I
had to cancel because I just caught me I
always put like Biofreeze on so mean
rich fu kind of errands to run this
morning and it's not gonna work well
with vlogging is it let's see how the
weekend goes
just getting ready ridiculous as you can
see in my office still not really my
office it's such a mess so I think not
something we're gonna try and do this
weekend but we still got internet so I'm
like in between my place my parents
place
I love how sunny our front room is but
you walk towards it and it's just like
oh I think I'm gonna wear this top today
which is from Urban Outfitters it's like
a poner Nick but I just I feel very on
me and yeah I feel like a clever student
he's going to the library which is not
me for sure but I kind of like it
I don't know I've got a high-waisted
skirt little bit lovely without as
commonly work to wear that's they so I
think I'm dressing like the clever
person today
we actually changed my top it just
didn't feel grow me so now I'm wearing a
blue kind of checked shirt thing I think
the other top will just get better with
skirts if anyone else has a bathroom
without shaver plugs you'll know why our
electric toothbrushes are currently
sitting in the kitchen charging I've
just popped back to my parents to pick
up a few things and then I think we're
going to go to this design and find the
tickets that I remember what it's called
two shows of pure design I think it's
like a home interior design festival at
the old Truman brewery which is I read
last week for the friends thing which is
with but I think we're gonna go there
now with my sister and brother
ruin Brick Lane and we found a parking
spot it's best in parking Monday to
Friday and Sunday it's like opposite of
what normally it's free on Sunday and on
Saturday so if we're gonna get a ticket
or that was an amazing parking space
we're just walking now I think we gonna
go to the street food bit and get some
bits to eat
I went for chicken strips and chips this
is the party's good bit of food market
rate I'll show you after sorry I would
like behind the children
there's a little pop-up Etsy shop here
so we're gonna go have a look and
there's also a little pop-up H&amp;amp;M that
lets likes but all the best stuff so
we're gonna go see what's inside
so we now come into this design show
thing we're going to have another
collapse we get richer this bag
it's a little bit later now and I'm back
it flat I'm sitting on our beanbag and
we've still got but it was a fair
haven't come yet but we're getting that
cheese day that's very exciting
they're Design Show things really cool
actually it was just like all different
interior designers and we saw few things
that we liked and took cards you can
like buy stuff there you have to go and
look at the brands and I'm sure they're
gonna forward you I took a few cards
just in case or some nice bedside tables
it's just really nice to look around I'm
really into that kind of thing at the
moment so we've been back at the flat
for a little while just kind of clearing
up and doing boring house things and
then I think tonight we're gonna go to
the cinema and have dinner we haven't
really decided yet what film
I'm so hungry so just making some crispy
kale while I wait for Gemma inventor
arrived Gemma's got an obsession with
many things but not just many things
many things compared to the the big
things so give her this like Chanel
bronzer sample and not obsessively
comparing the suit open them up this is
their just been to the shop I'll show
you what I got cherry tomatoes is
spaghetti so I can make dinner
look T pig's licorice peppermint tea so
everyone Sapna overpriced stuff now
crying is cheaper elsewhere I'll
remember that next time well
granola and guinea apple juice Gemma got
edamame coconut chunks snack I really
struggle to eat that quick about chunk
snack has in my hand mmm first area
baits not right I'm just making a pasta
sauce cherry tomatoes garlic courgette
and I'm gonna have spaghetti
okay so Jenna wants to basically and
then I just mine everything every oh it
means I'm I always wondered if that we
both have hairy arms and then you guys
saw them ambulating when I got big
fictive and I told her that she should
do it
she's gonna she doesn't have to do it
you may just not like an evil person I
make in a wedding this okay so we're
gonna try she's using the wrong one this
is like the entry number one so yeah
it's for where I still kept alive so
you're gonna give it its name is Apple
yes she does okay so I've warned her
first time you do is the worst you get
hot and bumpy's it is deeper um and then
it gets better from there
and you're gonna get very hot high
priority sure yeah oh you know anything
yeah really man up to very well
look at the difference between this song
and this up by the way was it's fine to
have hair yeah we've had it oh my god so
1927 yeah yeah I have never had an issue
then around please don't feel you have
to it's just for fun just wedding you
don't even
I've been taking Polaroids of everyone
who's coming to the flat German Ben
don't like their ones we gonna do we're
gonna do round two using this little
poll I'd it was so-so German Ben have
gone home and I'm going to finish the
vlog now and I probably vlog again
tomorrow but again I don't think we're
doing I'm not interesting but I know you
guys don't mind but I'll see you guys
tomorrow for another day of vlogging
night
so I've been having to think about
vlogmas I get tweets from you guys all
the time saying your watch watching last
year's vlogmas vlogmas and asking me
from doing it again this year
and if I'm honest I haven't really
decided yet I'm thinking probably not
just to kind of give you a heads up I
might change my mind but it's a hard one
vlogmas like I've been I wrote down like
the pros and cons and obviously I love
uploading everyday you get real
satisfaction over uploading the video
every day I love reading nuke your
comments I feel like it always brings us
a little bit closer because you get to
know me better but it's really hard it's
a really hard time of year to do it
because Christmas December my birthday
you kind of want to be spending time
with friends and family and I was
working so hard last year to get videos
up every day and then on the 24th of
December as soon as I finished I had so
much work to do because normally at
Christmas I would kind of pre write all
my blog posts and videos so that I get
some time off but because of vlogmas I
didn't have time to do that so it all
got a bit on top of me and this year I'm
going away in January so I feel like it
might make the whole thing a bit more
stressful and I like to just kind of
enjoy the Christmas time with friends
and families so that's something that's
making me not want to do it it's also
really intense like vlogging everyday
and opening yourself up the internet get
a lot of kind of comments and it's very
easy to get misunderstood on vlogs I
don't know if I really can take those
comments every day it's quite a lot to
deal with
so I don't know I might just do like two
vlogs a week I love watching vlogmas
videos I love the idea of doing them but
there's so much harder than they seem
and I just wish it was like a different
month December it's just not that sort
of month that you want to give up I
don't know I'm still thinking about it I
thought I'd let you guys know but I
might not do it this year today I'm
wearing this polo neck jumper from white
company last year with a little kind of
H&amp;amp;M long sleeve top underneath jeans and
boots I think we're gonna go to the
market with my sister maybe her whole
family thing really ill recently and
they're only now feeling a little bit
better so you might go see them and then
we're gonna go back to my parents and
get all the stuff for my office and
bring in because my office is just a
mess so I want to try and make it into
my office today even though I sold
have internet we just picked up some
sushi for lunch and these are lightly
pickled cucumbers and they're absolutely
delicious
the back of my parents which means we
can watch TV our TV of the woodwork yep
so we're gonna sit and have sushi and
watch TV I also picked up this sauce I
found it in a shop and I literally
didn't realize I couldn't live without
this and said I didn't have it and
leaned it back in my life we're gonna
put up some shelves and he's got a
couple more picture shelves and some
shelves in our bedroom as well although
we don't actually have anything to put
on them yet but I feel like it's good to
have something storage we said look the
company fire box sent me an emoji
cushion I really really love that it's
not like you're gonna go with the lounge
theme but I'm putting it there for now I
got this from home that was in my old
office and I think I'm gonna put it in
one of these little frames here that
looks kind of cool it's really hard to
decide what to put here but I'm just
kind of building up and then I'll pony
move things around but sweet then it may
be a bit like ooh look at us we're a
couple
I'm not sure oh maybe I'll put this one
next to the picture that rich proposed
to me with I might do that that'll make
more sense than with a bunny err forest
my computer's here now which I'm very
happy about I'm not sure that this
lampshade goes though it's kind of too
big and to have like one of those cool
trendy bulbs in it just makes it not
very good like for working with an you
know I'm find it a bit annoying which is
a bit annoying because I just bought it
or a shoe thought about that more but
maybe I can find somewhere else for it
to go and I can get a different kind of
small lamp just here I'm not sure oh
well it's like I've done well I didn't
make any other mistakes and the lamp was
the only mistake so far it just put this
stuff up I put the really really marry
me picture if I put that there
that's pretty cute isn't it so these
little cable things I bought from the
Container Store in LA so you stick them
and basically it's a way of controlling
all your cables so I've just pump on
here and for my external hard drive
wait nuts charging so that I'll take
this around for that will always just
kind of stay like that and then I can
just plug it in there when I need it
these are gonna stay on my desk for the
moment the pixi hydrates
he missed which I love the Oscar
Renaissance hand cream and this is
aromatherapy support oil though I like
to sniff when I'm feeling stressed
slowly but surely organizing my desk
keep forgiving that unblocking I'm
having too much fun like singing away to
Adele's first album it just reminds me
of first year uni we turn it down for a
minute I'm actually just labeling my
drawers now I have a bit of time I've
like put my perfumes out and yeah I'm
just like labeling them like daily base
with my beloved dynamo label maker love
this Lily's label maker I'll probably
see a full video though on my makeup
storage collection and stuff so I won't
say too much but I'm just making metal
labels just logging on to Anna's blog
because last Saturday she posted a blog
post there it is with a marble desktop
background and that sounds right up my
street because at the moment at the
moment I've got a really messy this
background it's just not calming so I'm
gonna download her marble one thanks
Anna
perfect actually it says Apps logo Docs
and work and I don't really use those so
I'm gonna kind of do some of the thing
but change the titles yeah I just put
work photos personal my office is
looking a bit more like my office now
apart from the side which is still a
mess like behind the door hair is always
gonna be like this but hopefully not
where do we put things like this you've
got this to clean the floor I just don't
know where we're gonna put her we have
zero storage in this flat that I have to
stay behind the door for a while I put
this picture on top of my desk I wanted
to put one of those shelves thing but we
attempted to put that up as you can see
here I'm gonna have to cover that in a
minute and this wall is just not tough
enough and it was kind of just falling
apart and shredding
so we've just put up the couple of nails
instead I think I'm gonna clock off now
because I'm going to Hoover the flat and
then
still making dinner and shallow and
watch X Factor so hip you guys have
enjoyed this blog and I will see you on
Thursday for another video I need to go
