weekend this is so exciting
we've actually been invited by Niels
yard which is so nice of them me and
Richie here and a few other bloggers and
I've never I don't have ever actually
even stayed at festival but I've never
been told earnest and it looks right up
my street it's all like well-being and
foodie music he and we are saying in one
of these amazing tents I mean this is
just ridiculous it's like it's like a
dream festival this is where we're
staying that bring you inside
I've got like a little bed and my nice
Neal's Yard things we're just so happy
to be we're gonna go take a look around
and just kind of get settled in and
we're here three days
still fairly not quite lunchtime so I've
just seen a grilled cheese sandwich
stand and would definitely get one of
those
we've just found out some really good
news so you managed to hunt down a
little bit champagne too good shot
this whole weekend is going to consist
of a lot of eating just a warning I'm
now having a Buddha bowl which is like
an Indian flute and free like rice and
potato massaman curry kind of Asian dish
and rich which did you go for liter
burger for the obser double taxi with
black pudding and after lunch we're
gonna head into the nails yard ten just
there and we're gonna have a little
workshop I think we're making our in
speaker just a rich as always wouldn't
it
I think I'll actually enjoy her actually
I bumped into my lovely look brilliant
it's just some to up completely if I had
to describe my fifth floor in the story
and we're a healer town she's gonna make
this have a short speaker
five o'clock now so we're gonna head
back to our tents we have some water and
Christmas in case you get hungry which
is impossible I'm so full we haven't
stopped eating this is so many amazing
places to the E is like making me panic
on it even though we're gonna head back
and have a bit of a lie down and relax
before dinner tonight
now just in our tents and I look a state
already idyllic to the mirror city day
one but I really like I can't express
enough how much I would recommend this
festival it's I mean obviously we're
doing like the VIP which is amazing but
I've already decided with all my friends
and they're all in that we're gonna come
back next year and definitely do like
the boutique campaign like it's worth it
to make it your summer holiday and
coming from that Thursday the
accommodation is so nice the food is
amazing there's just so many cool things
here so I'm really happy to be here
and I'm just gonna have some chill-out
time now this tent is so nice and Isis
lie here in the car after few minutes
Keeler's we haven't quite made it to 1
a.m. which is when the valley opens it's
like couldn't was 12 we're gonna make
the long walk back to the tent
and have our first night sleep my knees
gonna be really cold by what Alma John
was I had a really fun night we had a
delicious dinner
amazing and have some fun dancing I've
lost my voice as usual and that's day
one done
it's day two we are walking around in
the beautiful sunshine we've been so
lucky with the weather people are doing
yoga everywhere this is so bizarre
we're like there was a big key for a
smoothie place it's just the most like
healthy festival ever we are on the hunt
for some breakfast and then we're gonna
spend the morning in the spa there's
like a lovely outside spar with hot tubs
and you can swim in the lake which I'm
not sure yet if I'm brave enough to do
but rich definitely will and I think
will be really nice relaxing morning
they watch this that he's changed they
what's there to eat
the rise and fall
keep
this outdoor spa is just a little bit
ridiculous it's insane it's amazing I
just sat on a hot tub rich dumped into
the lake eats forever I just I feel like
I'm in another country so in America we
just watched Jeremy loops on the main
stage and we're now gonna get our first
lunch we've decided referee to lunch
then early lunch and a late lunch I'm
going to try and pad - I can't possibly
get across in video or photos how many
things are going on here there's like
two small start bands now were there
they have like a wire and they teach
people how to sing and then there's like
foraging and there's a cricket match
going on there there's always like
different things scattered around it's
so so hot so we're gonna head over to
the little expand and Lincoln is
actually a friend of mine in company and
if I slowly so if you have some little
aches at festivals definitely try it out
because there's delicious kind of
natural good for you ice lollies I got
watermelon and Kiwis called the wills
and Kate and it's delicious actually
tastes like real watermelon there's like
nothing we are back at the tent now and
we've just been to the toilet and seen
there's a sign that says the showers are
now not working which is great only one
day to go maybe you weren't smelled that
bad I don't know I'm pretty sweaty I've
just kind of got ready for the evening
I'll show you my outfit in a minute I'm
attempting this kind of hair thing but I
can't French plats or Dutch braids to
save my life this is like my third
attempt kind of looks okay from the
front but from the back oh my god of ABC
like the biggest mess ever it doesn't
even make sense that it's terrible but
it's off my neck and that's all that
really matters better than just having
it in a bun we're gonna go to the main
stage because apparently someone really
good is on at 6:00 we don't really know
any of the people playing but we're
gonna go check it out it's still quite
warm outside but it gets quite cold in
the evening so I'm gonna take my jacket
and we're just gonna have a fun night
last night was quite heavy so I think we
probably gonna take easy tonight
last night was a much chillier sleep and
today it's definitely colder yesterday
was a really hot day
I mean t-shirt jeans and I'm kind of
shivering but we're hoping it's gonna
warm up a bit it's our last day we have
a nother Neal's Yard workshop this
morning and then we have a lovely
massage this afternoon for heading home
so we thought today in my hair has not
made it to the final day it's looking
horrible but we've woken up early so
that we can go to really flat breakfast
then we get avocado on toast with
poached eggs
spent the morning whilst I found some as
charge my camera battery at the Neil's
yards can have you know aromatherapy
kind of central ores Coppola's class
everything you know like don't have to
give each other our massages and how to
use oils properly actually if we're
really inspired I want to get into
essentials now and then we just sat and
listened to some really nice music at
the kind of chill out Folk Music tent
and living a fun time to eat now on may
be thinking partying but we've just
eaten so much this weekend I love it
we've really got the word that wrong
today it's beautiful and sunny now so
you have to commit back to the changes
what you're about to see here is a giant
game of musical chairs and it's
hilarious
oh and I forgot to mention that there
was a middle-aged guy running around
naked throughout the game that was fun
and so oiled up from a massage when I
was here these late news yard product
alright there's been a lack of but my
taxes are there like one out set up with
white shoulders
in a good way so we're gonna head back
to the ten or pack up soon and then here
trust me I'm gonna head home I've had
such a good time and I'm just loving
walking around safety miss Lilly while
we're still here this is how I'm
choosing to spend my last hour here got
the duvet out the 10 nice and sweet I'm
pretty happy right now this is what I
can see we've got the way rich not you
learn pretty tent
it's time to go but I don't want to go
I'm so comfy here

braces in but I had the most amazing
