guide and don't forget to watch to the
end because I have something quite
exciting to tell you about so soon as my
autumn style guide video went down so
well I thought I'd do another one for
winter so it works just the same I've
got three categories style home and
nails and I love you asked where I
didn't include makeup or beauty and it's
because that's what I always talk about
so I don't want to be repeating myself
and talking about the same products
again and again
so hopefully you like these categories
I've picked out and I'm gonna start with
style so obviously in winter hats and
gloves are very important I still
haven't found a perfect scarf I love my
Zara one but I want one that's a little
bit thinner and maybe Kashmir I've got a
birthday coming up so I'm trying to hint
to people but I've got my hat and gloves
sorted and actually the same ones that I
wore last year they're not very exciting
they're quite plain but they do the job
well and they work perfectly for me my
hat is from American Apparel and it's
one of their beanies and some people
hate these some people love them they
kind of go come up a bit high on the
head but I really like them because
they're really kind of snug they fit my
head well and they look quite smart
thing they go with the sort of outfits I
wear and it's just really plain and
simple it keeps your head warm and I
really like it my gloves are from Muji
and they look like this they're just
black with grey stripes and they're not
very exciting but the reason I love
these because you can use your touch
screen like iPhone phone with them and
that is just the lifesaver there's no
point in having really soft warm gloves
if you have to keep taking them off
every time you need to check your phone
it's really annoying your hands get
really cold gets really cold like
January February in the UK so you can't
take your gloves off and yeah this is
really good I think it's because they've
got a metal threaded into the fingertip
so you can't feel it but it means you
can use the iPhone so these are perfect
these are looking a little bit old and
dusty from last year so I might get a
new pair they've got a few different
patterns but they're all quite plain
which I like anyway the next winter
style essential a good pair of warm
tights and I think you all know what's
coming up it's the Primark super cozy
tights everyone talks about these and
it's for good reason they are the best
things ever if you haven't tried these
tights seriously you have to they're
only three pounds
and they're probably the warmest things
were ever pulling your legs in your life
basically fleece-lined but they don't
make your hot and sweaty you don't feel
like overheated they're just perfect and
on the outside they just look like
normal kind of opaque tight but they're
so soft and they keep your legs so warm
I have one of these in the snow before
and I couldn't feel any cold on my legs
they're amazing and only three pound
fifty so I always stock up that winter
final item for the star category is a
good winter handbag probably not
essential but I like to buy a new
handbag during the winter months and I
have found such a bargain handbag at
Marks and Spencers which is somewhere I
never go to buy clothes or accessories
or anything but I went in it to buy some
tights and saw this bag and went back
the next day to buy it it looks like
this so it's pretty big it's quite long
and it's got a handle that you probably
could wear over your shoulder if you
wanted but you can also just kind of
hold it on your arm like that I really
like it it's pretty much a ripoff of the
Sophie whom one of the things they say
this was only 35 pounds which is such a
good deal I really love the big gold
buckles and this sign it has a pocket on
the front as well just loads of space
inside it's good if I'm lugging around
my camera or my notepad or my laptop
it's so nice and really smart and chic
and I love that kind of smart winter
look okay so now onto home and
decorating your home for winter and
Christmas is just the best I don't know
how I pitched three things in this
category because I could probably go on
for a whole video about home Christmas
winter decoration the first thing is a
candle again because I love a good
candle
this one is from the white company the
white company do amazing winter
Christmas stuff so I'm going to be going
on about them a little bit too much in
this video and I know they're expensive
but if you're wanting a nice present or
you want to treat yourself it's a really
good place to go so this is the wild
mint peppermint spearmint and white tea
candle it comes in this white kind of
matte chalky thing with a lid and you
probably can't see from there but it's
got wild mints got the name of the
candle embossed on the front and this is
just the most incredible smell it's not
particularly Christmassy I don't really
love Christmasy sense because I'm not a
big cinnamon fan but this is really
fresh and smells a little bit like
pine Coney it's just ridiculously fresh
I can't explain the smell but it's so so
nice and like minty and it smells like a
good cup of mint tea I really like this
and the white company handles a really
good quality and just fill the room with
scent and I think this one looks really
nice as well so obviously if you do
celebrate Christmas you're going to want
some tree decorations to decorate your
home decorate your tree and just make
the whole house that really Christmassy
there are so many places to go for two
decorations I absolutely love the
Selfridges Christmas Emporium they've
got at the moment they have an elf
fridges section where they have people
wrapping Christmas presents are so cute
but they've got a whole Christmas
section that I went to look at with
pretty reindeers and wrapping paper and
cards and tree decorations I really like
the sort of delicate glass tree
decorations I saw really nice form while
I was there I've been going there like
every week to get my Christmas fix I
also noticed that Paper Chase has some
good tree decorations which is somewhere
I don't think people would necessarily
go for that but I went to get a birthday
card I saw they have loads of nice
Christmas things here are some I really
like these let me take them out the
patio oh wow it's one I thought these
were set by tree decorations that's
really cute there's much easier to hang
so they go around the tree like this you
could probably hang this around your
house as well if you wanted they're
basically little fabric trees all with
different prints on them
I love the whole red green white thing I
think you come up with a theme for your
tree most people do that I think we're
gonna go to silver and maybe this year
so these probably have to go elsewhere
but where else do not repeat I think
Primark do good tree decorations as well
there's just so many places so go and
find some nicer ones for I really like
these and they're from Paper Chase so
the final thing for the home category is
this and again it's from the white
company I'm really sorry I know it's
expensive but it's so so nice at
Christmas this is their potpourri so
potpourri is come in like dried up fruit
and leaves and things like that the
purple and it makes the room look pretty
nice pause this smell really nice this
one's from our winter collection which
is their kind of Christmasy scent and
it's got cinnamon clove and orange and
it comes to this pretty bag in the
ribbon so it'd probably be a really nice
present as well but it's just got like
pinecones and OH
close that cinnamon and it's really
pretty to put in a nice bowl it makes
the room smell really Christmassy and
just I really like this it's kind of
something a bit different as well
there's been now onto the final category
which is nails my favorite you know I
love now I've kind of cheated here I
haven't got three polishes but they kind
of split into three the first these
minis from Essie and this is their mini
winter 2013 collection I love when they
do minis I found mine at boots I don't
know I think super job probably do them
as well but they're so good because who
uses a whole bottle of Polish anyway so
in this collection is shearling darling
Parker perfect and toggle to the top
which is like a dark red kind of pale
muted down blue and raspberry glitter
shimmery polish and these are so nice
and so Christmasy and I've loved using
these I kept them in the packet just for
this video but I've been taking them out
and using them kind of everyday and
they're so nice I also did a blog post
on this so I'll link that below but
that's a really nice stocking filler as
my next winter nail polish pick is from
Topshop but I haven't actually borne
outputs from Topshop in quite a while
but I went in that the other day saw so
many nice winter shades that I liked
this one is called rumors and lies and
it's kind of a deep raspberry ready
burgundy so known as dark as something
like Revlon vixen which I've been
wearing a lot but it's it's still really
nice and wintery and just really nice
color I really really like this and tops
don't have some great colors the one I'm
wearing now is actually from the Topshop
in it's their matte navy blue that's
also really nice and finally from nails
a couple of polishes from wild about
beauty which I haven't spoken about on
here before but I do really like wild
about Beauty there but some really good
products and these two nail polishes in
particular are so lovely for Christmas
they're called Rachel and Lauren funny
me obviously name their polishes after
girls names which is a bit weird
Rachel is a kind of black green with
gold glitter in it it's really weird
really unique have we seen anything like
it it looks really nice it's very good
for like Christmas parties and Lauren
this one Lauren yeah is just a nice gold
glitter and I think everyone needs gold
glitter
for winter Christmas I think on
Christmas Day I'll do something with
so it's nice to use when your accent
nail as well I've also done a blog post
using this so I'll link that below and I
just took a really small amount another
brush and put a thin layer of gold
glitter over my ring finger and it's
really nice especially with a polish
like the Topshop one so that's been my
winter style guide and I probably won't
do another video like this until spring
which seems crazy but I wanted to get
this one done before Christmas I
promised you guys some exciting news so

makeup are going to be hosting a
