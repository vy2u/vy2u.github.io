have two hours to get ready for this
wedding let's do this okay the first
thing I do when I've got a night owl or
wedding or something like that is my
hair and makeup because that's a that
that takes the longest and the very
first thing I do is straighten my hair
completely because if I make it straight
then I feel like it gives it time to
just getting used to being straight and
fluffy and then I can come back to it
and curl it later and that always works
much better for me than just
straightening and curling it straight
away so I'm gonna go straight to my hair
then I think I'm gonna do my makeup I
should probably have breakfast actually
rich will come home and tell me on
fulfill a breakfast and go straighten my
hair first
okay I'm gonna quickly open my jo Malone
advent calendar also can you guys tell
me I think I've made a massive mistake
Charlotte Tilbury calendar is the 12
days of Christmas so I just assumed that
you open it from the 1st of December and
you and you have 12 days but am I really
wrong I meant is I meant with the 12
days leading up to Christmas or the 12
days after Christmas can you let me know
because I'm like very confused I'm not
gonna open it today I'm gonna wake your
comments to let me know
Gudrun yeah well my vlog is just
exported so I need to upload that now
I'm gonna add my um day 5 gym alone and
it over the black one that's like one of
the expensive ones
this is dark amber and ginger lily which
you might like that one yeah rich is
making an egg which is making 8 and 7
I'm just gonna have another card a good
weekend I'm not we're not gonna have a
lunch Joey when we drive in over lunch
on my avocado on toast waiting for my
vlog to upload quickly fill in all the
description box schedule tweets and
Facebook and then I really get ready
because I've got like an hour now oh my
god your breakfast it's so much better
than mine you're not gonna get hungry
think I'm gonna put my dress on because
I want to do my makeup and I hate doing
my makeup first and then putting the
dress on because I might get makeup on
it actually it goes on from the bottom
so I can all that and we do my makeup my
dressing gown but I'll show you I
decided to wear this dress the one that
I'm wearing to my friend's wedding in
February if there was a good excuse to
have try out and if I find it really
annoying I can't lift my arms up then I
have to find it another dress my
friend's wedding which would be a shame
but it's so pretty I'm gonna wear these
shoes which these are my top shop heels
with them I think I'll just look better
probably gonna wear like uggs there
because we're getting a lift so I can
leave them in the car and change into
these sewed up to wear them the whole
time and then this this is my new baby
now let me explain the story of this bag
I had the Sophie home bucket bag and I
showed in a vlog that I went inside the
bag and found a huge rip in the bag and
I was so upset so disappointed had
hardly worn it and he had up like seven
months and so I took it back to Liberty
where I bought it from and they were
really really helpful they said they're
gonna send about Sophie home and see if
they can get it fixed they no longer
sell that specific bucket bag anymore
which is weird because the new one
really isn't as nice but anyway they
sent it back and then they called me
like a month later saying it can't be
fixed in the UK if if I want it thick
they have to sent to Spain and it would
take like two or three months to come
back and it's like a real autumn winter
bags and by the time it comes back it'll
be like spring again so they said I was
expecting to say like you can have a
credit note but they actually said you
could have a full refund or you can send
it back to Spain so I was like it's a
shame because I like that bag but I'll
have a refund to get a new bag so I
added a little bit to that and I got
myself this bag which I absolutely love
it's from YSL it's really little and I
don't have a bag that I can wear to like
weddings and nights out where you just
kind of put your phone money keys in it
and it's got a long gold chain it's so
beautiful it's the sort of bag it's a
bit like a Chanel bag you kind of keep
forever and hand on to your daughter and
it's such good quality leather it's all
grainy so it won't scratch easily and
you can also wear it like a clutch you
can wear it crossbody on your shoulder
there's always you can wear it I love it
it doesn't really go with this dress
because it's gold and the dress is
silver but you know what I don't care
because it's first our team
and I really want to wear it oh it's
love for my god so much makeup this
isn't this is just like the base stuff
as well but as I said we're driving up
to Hamish this morning so I need my
makeup to last pretty much all day and
all night which is very difficult so I'm
gonna hit use a glowy primer good
foundation concealer powder it I'm gonna
use like a really nice natural blush
bronzer contour and going all out I
haven't decided yet if I want to do like
a nice warm smoky eye with maybe like
Mac Mayer lipstick or if I want to do
like a slightly glittery eye maybe
that'll be too much with the dress I
don't know I'm not really good at the
whole match and makeup with my outfit
thing let me go and look at the dress
again this is Urban Decay diamond dog
which is a really pretty eye shadow and
I'm wondering if just a little bit of
that patted on top of my eyes would go
with the dress I think I might think I
might your warm smoky eye with a tiny
bit of this it's like a nice taupe color
come on camera you can do it you can do
it
no it literally can't do it
oh there you go if I touch the screen it
focuses so yeah I think a little bit of
that would be really nice and festive
Rich's panicking so I told him check
last week whether dinner suits means bow
tie or tie you just checked and it means
bow tie you're gonna go out and buy one
oh my god you look hilarious and a bow
tie even want a bow ties it's odd our
dance first year uni I guess on my face
which gasps by beta by I've done my base
so we'll agree with once but as I said
in Easter last it will kind of go down a
little bit I'm gonna do warms my heroes
with a little bit of that glitter on top
now and then a black liquid eyeliner
look how pretty that open secure
eyeshadow is I don't if you can see it
properly but it's like the gorgeous
taupe e-gift has got like silver flecks
in it it makes your eyelid look a little
bit wet I love it eyes are done kind of
warm brown with a bit of topi glitter
black eyeliner quite a bit of eyeshadow
underneath and now I'm just gonna do my
lips
wearing Mac saw and mer together I
haven't worn them both together for
quite a while I wear mare
but this kind of just himself a bit
makes it a bit more like that so is a
lovely color just by itself it's a
little bit drying I find that when you
put mare on top is a bit more hydrating
even though it's a matte lipstick I find
that Mac matte lipsticks can be quite
hydrating as well that's what they look
on together so Mayer just makes it a
little bit more plumbing less brown and
I really like it okay my hair is done
God Matt says I've had it cut haven't
they think I've called it properly and
it goes social but I like it that'll do
it's a bit messy but it will all drop in
a minute anyway
I'm gonna go put on my dress and my
jewellery and stuff just so you know
rich is still in his gym clothes we have
about half an hour till he needs leave
yeah five minutes you're just saying
that because you're running late we have
a slight problem this bag would be great
if I just taking my phone money keys
lipstick but because of bloody vlogmas
and his take a camera I'm even trying to
fit in my like smaller camera and it
does kind of fit but then if I can't put
the chain inside and where it's a clutch
hmm I'm gonna put my dress on and see if
I can solve this problem I've put loads
of rings on this one is from I think
this I got this one market and then the
ones that Miss finger are from my love
just forgotten everything it's like an
online shop oh my god I can't remember
these are all from the same place and
then the big ones of Monarch of an eider
and the small ones from shop ban on me
and I really like all these rings I
managed to fit the small camera in my
bag so I'm going to take a small camera
with me so I'm going to switch over from
this one to this one these are what
these shoes look like with the dress
much better than flats that definitely
not as comfortable or secure but I don't
know if I'll be dancing crazy at this
wedding so really happy with the outfit
I'm gonna wear my big fur coat on top
just waiting to leave the flat but
someone's taking their time polishing
their shoes oh did you shave yeah no I
tried to keep it no one else hates it
with her boyfriend shaves I so much
prefer it's done understand I tried to
do it but this new I got a new shaver
and the stubble thing came off and it
went left like a powder a clean patch
here so I had to shake it all off I'm
gonna put my uggs on I'm gonna be
absolutely ridiculous but I'm gonna keep
them on all the way for the drive to
Cambridge and then I'll change my shoes
they'll keep my feet warm I think
just get this and honks snazzy we really
danced at a wedding
oh my god imagine I'm so comfortable
rich I think our dress code should be
ugh she answered that this is the dress
that I said I can't be lift my arms up
when I look to their this big it's so
tight that it feels like it's gonna rip
I know if it's just the design of the
dress or because it's too small for me
and I have to get a 10 because they
didn't have a 12 and it's really
annoying because it actually fits like
it fits my waist it's not too tight it's
just I think because I've got slightly
broad shoulders although the shoulders
fit as well so annoying I think I
remember to it I mean like in between a
six and a seven shoes I think I'm in
between a 10 and a 12 like parts of my
body a 10 but then because I've got big
boobs like sometimes like this I think
it's quite tight up here because of that
it's too late to take it back now they
don't never have the receipt but dinner
just have to be careful okay I've
switched back to my old s120 camera it's
weird not to be able to see myself but
it actually feels like coming home I
feel used to carrying this camera it's
nice and small I think we're gonna go
soon rich is fat fain he I've been ready
for ages here's Papa Papa fluffing but
we are gonna have to get the overground
to Essex where we're meeting our friend
John who's then driving us to Cambridge
I also don't know how much I'm gonna
have to film itself so your weddings I'm
not gonna like whit my camera out at
awkward times but maybe there'll be
opportunities where I can I'm just glad
to play it by ear
okay rich is still rapping but it's
nearly there the system opening his new
tie buy something really exciting just
half of it happened I realized this
dress has pockets let me show you in the
mirror putting a wire makes me excited
because I'm not gonna be all spending in
them all my days pockets pockets in a
posh dress genius which is looking very
smart in his suit we have a bit of spy
on yet we're sending a car we're in uber
so then we just have to get on an
overground
and in a car
eventually we'll be there okay we've got
a slight problem the Train just lets the
other grants 15 minutes of the next
train we're already meant to be there
five minutes I'm really annoyed at
richness that we should leave early and
I'm jonesing and the window my hair is
going frizzy so we asked an uber not s
expense of 20 minutes which means we're
gonna be 20 minutes late for the ride
and I just really hope for the word
we're finally in the car on the way to
Cambridge until interest again that kind
of have forgiven him and John's driving
and alpha City Mayor John Rich lived
with John at uni and I lifted out flee
and second tier unity so we all like

frizzy hair okay we're here we found a
space everyone's putting their ties on
