Winterlicious tag i wasn't actually
tagged to do this but I've seen the tag
going around and it looks like a really
good one I wanted to do a Christmas tag
for a while but none of them I didn't
really like any of them so this one is
all I really liked it oh I hope this
video comes out well I'm in a different
room because I wanted to film front of
my christmas tree I'm trying out a new
light so I probably look really pale and
I've just realized that I think my voice
is really echoey so this could be a
massive disaster but I have my senses
how long and that's all that matters I
hope rich when it got this to me from
the pawn shop which is very nice but I
love it can't do Christmas video without
Santa's hound so I'm gonna get started
there's 12 questions and let me just
check with a archon remember these when
you i pod very exciting and the first
question is favorite winter nail polish
and I was thinking about this one I
don't really have like a favorite winter
nail polish I change my nails like every
two to three days and I like to try
everything so I don't really have like a
favorite one but these two I am really
loving in sort of autumn winter months
the first one is leighton denny and this
is called temptress and it's a purple
and black glitter but it comes out
really gloopy and gel like in it just
leaves a really nice flat finish it's
not like a really glittery finish and I
love lessons in nail polish is a really
good quality and whenever I put my nails
this and put photos on Instagram you
guys always go crazy for it so I think
this is going to be really popular one
and also really like revlon vixen which
is more of an autumn color but i think
it works throughout all the kind of
colder months and it's just like a
really nice burger deep plum color quite
grown-up and sophisticated I think
that's a really nice one as well the
second question is favorite winter lip
product again this is a hard one but
I've actually even though it's not that
Christmasy I think it's Mac plum fall
because I got this recently and I just
every single day it's obviously as the
name suggests a really nice plum color
it's kind of not my lips are better
because it's more of a stronger color
but it's just really flattering I love
it I know sdfm st boston also loves this
lipstick she did a really good review on
her blog and I think this is quickly
become one of my favorite MAC lipsticks
and the one I'm wearing today is a
Revlon lip butter and cherry top which
is really nice red for how to put a
little red in for Christmas so the third
question is most worn winter clothing
piece and this is easy not very
glamorous but my Primark super cozy
tights I talk about this all the time
they're literally the best things in the
world the best place I've ever bought
they're really cheap so from Primark
they're really thick and they have like
a fleece lining inside but you don't get
too hot in them they're just perfect but
I actually love them and I wear them
like every day throughout the winter
most worn winter accessory I'll try have
a thing at the moment it's this hat
which is my top top hat that i showed in
a haul video i really liked it and i've
been wearing it loads but i haven't
really got puffing this i haven't really
got like a most worn winter accessory I
don't think probably remember something
off this video but yeah I really like
this one and I'm getting quite into hats
at the moment favorite scent or candle
this one is easy we have this one
burning in my lounge for a few weeks now
and with more than halfway through it
realtor obsessed with in my house and is
the germ alone roasted chestnut candle
and this is the big one and it
absolutely incredible it literally
smells like Christmas like cold and
yumminess it smells a bit like a wood
fire as well it's just the most perfect
Christmas candle and this is literally
always lit in my land and ever
and have warms the room as well because
so big just absolutely love this candle
favorite winter beverage I think I've
got not in to let the starbucks drinks I
don't you drink coffee and I have love
sweet drinks so I think it has to be
mulled wine ever actually really like
mulled wine and it's week because I'm
not red wine lover to I wish I was it's
really i like the thought of drinking
red wine but i don't actually really
like it but i really like my wine and I
always kind of get one for any other
christmas market and we make it at home
as well and it's really on me i really
like it well it's our favorite christmas
holiday movie it is hard it's too hard
to pick one anything anyone elses picked
one I've watched our videos so i have
like 30 first one is like a complete
joke one and it could i'll be home for
christmas I don't if any of you guys
would have even heard of it it's one of
those films that came on the sin amor
for a minute and then knowing what's
here but me and my friend Hannah just
some reason had this weird tradition
that we watch this film every year and
we know all the words you know it's one
of the ones we literally know all the
words and all the songs in it and it's
rhys tupid crappy film but we love it
but I actually don't have even watched
it for a while because I had it on tape
and we didn't have a tape player anymore
so I might have a bio DVD I'm sure it's
like 50 p or Amazon or something I also
love the Grinch of course everyone loves
the Grinch I seem to watch that every
years always on TV elf is obviously the
best absolutely love elf and the holiday
which is Cameron Diaz and however his
name literally had a blank but the
really good looking guy and I like that
phone that's all like cozy cottage II
and snowy and just all these functions
for minor Christmas so I always liked
them favorite Christmas holiday song we
normally play like around Christmas we
played like James Taylor Christmas album
and I really like the she in him
Christmas album which is zooey
deschanel's band and we like kind of
nice versions of Christmas songs like
that obviously all the cheesy ones are
good too but I don't think I
have learned of the evidence or they're
just always on the radio favorite
holiday food or treat I think treat
sorry I shall keep looking down I burned
my finger this morning on my
straightness and it's absolutely
throbbing it's kind of getting worse
throughout this video so that's why I'm
looking down I think treat before we
leave mince pies they're really unlike
me they're not something I would think
that I would like but I do and I love
them heated up with cream and yeah
that's quite a nice Christmas treats
food wise my mom makes the most amazing
like on Christmas Day she makes the most
amazing stuffing I didn't even know if
it's like what stuff he should be like
because it's just white needs to but it
tastes like you can see what else he's
not soup texture it's like stuffing a
number it's just delicious and she also
makes carrot and sweet potato mash I
think that's what's in it I don't know I
call it shoosh I'm always like oh can
you pass you some smush I don't know I
just want to call it but it's delicious
so there's too much will always my
favorite things at Christmas Day but I
also really like Brussels sprouts I
think my family though you people that
actually like them but they're all kind
of a big fan of them I think they're
nice fish beads and more than once a
year what's your favorite Christmas
decoration this year and let me grab it
off the tree I think it's this boo exes
are a hoe imagine if you guys saw my
vlog and bought some tree decorations
and I think these are so cute they read
with your white snowflakes that kind of
look like polka dots from far and this
is the rain doing one there was like a
star a bell all these other ones but I
like the reindeer one's the best um I
think these are really cute what's at
the top of your Christmas list nothing
because I don't know my birthday's you
guys know if you're going on about
enough as the ninth of number so I've
obviously always had but they just roll
Christmas so I kind of get everything I
want for my birthday and then I harder
to look forward to Christmas I look
forward to giving presents that sounds
really cheesy but in love Gibby
that you go through the effort of
thinking of something wrapping it it's
really exciting till I see people's
reactions we do Secret Santa my family
and because it kind of got to the point
where we are either in poor by the end
of it or we would find like cheap
presents and normal you got anything
they wanted so we do you see the Sun so
we will pick a name out hat and have to
buy that one person a gift with red spam
budgets everyone kind of gets one really
good thing and so yeah I like giving
presence and I haven't really people
been asking out would you what would you
want I haven't got anything that I want
I can't I don't I got an ipad for my
birth but that's all I really wanted and
yeah anything really so I haven't really
got anything on my list it's more about
like seeing family and eating food and
stuff what are your plans for the
holiday this year so this year we're at
home osseo we were in Miami for
Christmas so it wasn't really like
christmas day it was really hot and we
didn't mean to proper lunch and this
year we're home and rich is staying here
in London this year so as we the first
time I think he's probably had Christmas
here because he was with us in Miami but
it wasn't like our proper Christmas at
home so we normally wake up in the
morning dew stockings I'm not sure if
I'm getting stuff kids this year think
I'm a little bit old now but I know my
mom quite help myself and my sisters
come over with all the kids and stuff
and we do a big lunch with all the usual
kind of turkey stuffing yummy things my
mom when I makes table it really pretty
puts a little crackers on the table and
then we do presence after lunch I know a
lot people do presence in the morning
but we will think that kind of if you
depress in the morning and then have a
lot
the afternoons normally a bit depressed
and have all kind of fools asleep on the
sofa and I don't know I find that part
of Christmas really depressing so we
changed it for years ago so that we open
our presents after lunch so that
something to do and it just kind of you
know when you're full of the lunch and
they see afternoon a lot nicer and then
we normally play games and stuff and
watch christmas films Christmas TV and
that's about it I think Christmas Eve we
normally go out for drinks like to a pub
or something with friends I'm not sure
if that's happening this year but that's
normally our tradition so yeah that's
kind of my Christmas Day really and I
think that's everything from this time
that's everything so I hope you like a
little Christmas video I dressed up to
the occasion so I hope you guys liked it
so thank you for watching and I hope
you'll have a very Merry Christmas and a
lovely day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
