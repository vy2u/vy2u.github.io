current work makeup routine first of all
I apologize for my hair I've just thrown
up size out my
it's just the mess but I wanted to show
you the soft makeup I wear to work at
the moment I change up every couple of
weeks but this is the sort of thing I'm
going for at the moment quite summer
Jimmy look so I hope you enjoy it thanks
for watching so I've already used the
origins brighter by nature SPF 35
because it's a sunny day so I wanted to
use a SPF under my makeup I then used
the Laura Mercier foundation primer all
over my face using the flat of my hands
I'd just sort of smooth it over my face
just like a canvas really and it's
making for my makeup lasts all day
I then use the warrior cell-22 clock
Foundation which is the new one in b14
and just use my hands to apply that at
first just sort of smoothing it over my
face
I then use the Real Techniques buffing
brush to sort of blend out the edges and
just make it more of a flawless look
making sure it all blended in in the
places where it needs to be I then use
my Bobbi Brown corrector in light bisque
with my gemma kid number seven brush to
just cover my dark circles is a really
nice pinky cream concealer
I then use my Mac two to four brush to
blend the sin
I then use my collection perfecting
concealer just on any blemishes or red
marks around my face and a little bit
more under my eyes because the Bobbi
Brown corrector is a little bit too
light so I use that anywhere that needs
it and then again use the Mac two to
four blur brush to blend it in this is
my favorite brush to use for concealer
because I think it really gets a nice
flawless finish
I then use an HD brows brow Pizza to
just smooth out my eyebrows keep them in
place all day
I then use my Gemma kid Jiri glow
all-over radiance creme in rose gold
this is a really nice cream highlighter
and I just use my finger to apply it to
my cheekbones and now my nose and this
gives a really nice of summer dewy glow
and then go with my NARS Laguna bronzer
using my Real Techniques blush brush and
just sort of apply this to the contours
of my cheek and up to my forehead and
just run outside of my face to warm up a
bit I find this brush really good to use
because it's quite long and pointed so
it's good for contouring
for blusher I like to use NARS deep
throats it's a really nice peachy color
with my japonesque three to four brush
which I really love for blusher and I
just apply this to the top of my
cheekbones because I think that she
suits my shape face the best then I used
MUA eye primer before putting on any
eyeshadow because this really makes it
last all day and it's a really nice eye
primer and it's very cheap so I just
apply this to my eyelids and underneath
if I'm going to be using shadow and then
just blend it in with my finger
for eyeshadow I'm using the Mac jaunty
eyeshadow from the hey sailor collection
with Mac two one seven brush and just
putting that all over the lid it's a
really nice champagne color
I'm then using from my Inglot palette
that in Glock 42 - which is a matte
color and again with a Mac t17 I'm just
using that on the crease of my eye just
on the outside and sort of blending it
in a bit just for a bit of contour a bit
of shadow but it's still quite natural
I then use my cleaner to 1-7 brush I
have to to blend that in a bit more just
adding a bit more of our shadow into the
corners and then using a royal and
langnickel gl4 smudger brush to use the
same eyeshadow just underneath the lash
line and slightly more on the top then
using my soap and glory super cat's
liquid eyeliner I apply a very thin line
to the top of my eye I couldn't really
film this bit because I'm so blind I had
to get really close to the camera
but then I go in with my makeup forever
smoky lash mascara which is one of my
favorite mascara is for the daytime and
just apply this all over my lashes I
don't really use a color during the week
it's just another step I can't really be
bothered to do so this is fine on its
own and you can kind of see I've got a
really thin line of liner above my eye
then to finish it off I'm using the
Loreal Rouge caress lip butter in dating
coral which is a nice summer color and
that's the final look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
