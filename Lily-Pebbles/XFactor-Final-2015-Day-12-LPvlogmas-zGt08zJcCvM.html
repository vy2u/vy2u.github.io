morning everyone its blog mas de 12
first thing I'd say this morning it's so
funny you know that my mom got me a lumi
like for my birthday and always raised
about hers and she wakes up at like 5:00
in the morning so I thought maybe this
is the thing that's gonna make me a
morning person and a parent so the light
that comes on half an hour for your
alarm wakes you up gradually all of that
turns out light doesn't affect me or
wake you up look at this photo Richard
this is this morning of me I'm fast
asleep and the whole bedroom was so
bright and I literally didn't bat an
eyelid didn't wind me up at all bit of a
disappointment let's see what's in my
Jamie lone advent calendar today was it
the 12th I just said it but I can't
remember
orange blossom body cream that's nice
and my dairy milk I can calendar
I really recommend getting it out the
cons are late because you appreciate it
so much more every day okay we're gonna
head it into town to do some shopping
this is what I'm wearing today my
Topshop jeans my Steve Madden boots this
is a dress from November night but I'm
wearing it it's like a long top I'm also
wearing an H&amp;amp;M hoodie underneath just
because I think it's going to be
spitting of its rip tonight today I like
to have a hood my a sauce leather jacket
this beautiful scarf you can't really
see it it's kind of gray and black and
it has a few subtle star prints on it
this is from a Lillian Lionel and it's
so soft and cozy I absolutely love it
they gave it to me for my birthday and I
was just so happy it came yesterday and
my bag is stress free of Scotland and
that's about it really I'm wearing a
Laura Mercier spy stories lipstick today
which I really liked and I just left my
hair straight comedy bullets kylix I
hope
curl it later we're probably either
gonna go to like the surface area or
Covent Garden and just look around some
shops really because I think this is
probably the last time I'm gonna go into
town shopping before Christmas so I like
being in town even though it's busy it's
quite Christmasy because of all the
Christmas lights and I don't know about
you guys at this time of year I just
want to go shopping
always so I just want to look around
some shops really we've decided instead
of going to town to go to Westfield in
Stratford because it's starting to rain
and it's just not fun walking around
town when it's raining with an umbrella
you don't hit everyone with your
umbrella so we're just heading that way
now we're at Westfield and I have a list
of Christmas presents that I used to get
so I think we're gonna walk around this
one's way bigger than the other one no
trace you can go and see Santa oh the
food cool style is laughs I know you
would have enjoyed that there's
Renaissance it's got to get so fancy and
digital you guys get early enough there
is actually pretty empty
Richard demonstrates in the emptiness a
lot of stuff combined today's Christmas
present so I can't me show you but I
mean because at the moment I'm looking
for myself if I love it in it just
trying on this long black coat I have a
coke addiction I really like this
definitely missing some at least my
wardrobe very successful I thought my
grandma present and rich is carrying
honey's this is present as well she's
got a lover who are getting a bit of
hungry now so we're gonna head outside -
there's so many options here we've come
to the tsavorite eye and it's so early
but only just for 12 so it's like
everything here but Jeff's never had
Basava attire and you know it's mine and
me to say place so you could be bringing
her and I ordered the same thing every
time so I'll show you what you're
getting at
do you like Thai food yes you know how
to tie food oh my god
interesting I hope you like it I always
get the same thing I always get breaded
king prawns with chili lime sauce and
then the Pad Thai but without dried
shrimp I don't mind the porns but the
dried shrimp artificially they're all
really good
I am properly defeated I'm going to ask
this in a takeaway box too good toys
we're gonna pay using the app it's so
easy and you can might split it and you
don't need to like the waitress or
anything so definitely download the
Basava app have it leo
justin Uniqlo buying loads of heat tech
stuff cuz we're going skiing in January
and these like special Japanese
technology so it keeps you warm when
you're cold but it keeps it cool in your
heart it's really good something like a
long sleeve and a best opera polo neck
we're gonna head to the white company
because rich hasn't bought me a birthday
present yet and I really want a
dressing-gown
I never you see us dressing gowns when I
lived at home I think that's because my
house was warmer than our little flat I
come out the shower and it's so cold and
now I finally know why people have
dressing outs and I really want one
and the dressing gowns this is the
dressing and I want it's like super soft
it's got hurt and it's long so snuggly
while I'm waiting to find out if they
have my size I looked up and Keisha's
model in the dressing gown that I'm
buying how ridiculous is that we ended
up going for the dark grey dressing I
didn't have any white I did throw the
white but it was 20% off at the moment
and they didn't have a garden store
either so we thought we just get it
could be saved like 15 million with the
turning so really excited to wear that
just paying for parking and someone just
left their phone recharging there's no
one around you can't decide if someone's
really trustworthy or they've forgotten
that their phone was there weird ice
skating rink is up at Somerset House so
pretty also always fully booked but
we're now in Covent Garden me and Jess
both want to go to the Burberry beauty
box and
Robin Space NK original silicon a winter
coat
it's literally there are so many
tourists here there is actually mental
it's not like Londoners every London has
no better that's come to common garden
on Saturday like a couple of eats for
Christmas but it was so many tourists
right I've got some presents and spacing
cake I'll show you what's inside and our
way in brandy melville coz is a new one
a couple garden
they were gonna head into the Burberry
box cuz Jess wants Foundation and I want
an eye shadow I'm finally gonna give
into the pale barley height and just buy
it everyone runs on about how good this
eye shadow is I'm just giving the
Burberry candles a sniff and this one
fire embers is amazing
Jess do you like smell of this loafer
it's so nice sounds like an open fire
love that there was a lovely girl in the
Berkeley shop with Zara who helped us
and she works on weekends because she's
a mother and I've actually met her
before and she was really really lovely
so thank you Sarah and if you guys over
in Covent Garden on the weekend very
same right to Zara in the burger shop to
his trains big enough we rushed home and
I could get got changed because we're
gonna stay excited to find out we have
to be there like 5:30 really early
because there's like a post-show party
thing so I just quickly topped up my
makeup and a bit more eyeliner put a bit
of that pale barley eyeshadow red
lipstick and I'm wearing my nearly in
line or shirt my wire cell bag black
jeans and boots I feel like this is kind
of smart enough I don't really know what
I'm going to but yeah I kinda like that
person's fine jacket and I'm gonna wear
a scarf I'm just gonna wear my coach of
azor Londo and my lily and lionel scarf
a very Lillian Lionel today and my boots
from Jude and we're ready to go my
sister was just round and she said oh my
god you're so lucky
Adele's performing one Direction's
before me I was like I call it death and
cold player got so excited and then we
realize that Sunday night not tonight
gusted apparently all that like X passed
X Factor winner's or something a
performing so it should be good not
quite as good as Adele way we're just
coming up to the Hilton which is right
next to em buddy now how excited on a
scale of ones telling you
security is a little bit intense so I
hope I can film tonight guys that can be
got the letter did not really but say
it's more of a ticket

bar there's like ice cream any people or
and chocolate and a speaker makes and a
queue

back to be on the food stolen I'm really
hungry now but we had a really good time
I'm really jealous I'm not gonna be a
tomorrow night what a Dell
I'm now home and we had a really fun
night Reggie and boli and Louisa are in
the final I love them both I think I
think raging Bodi would benefit more
from winning I feel like this person
comes second does better anyway so the
reason we'll be fine either way but
Reggie or bony I think would really
appreciate winning so I I'm kind of
rooting for that so even though I think
Louise is better it was really fun and
I'm home now and my highlight of the day
probably buying a dressing-gown because
I can't wait to put it on I'm just
running myself a bath ya know I really
want to have eleven okay I'm so cold my
budget was so cold everyone had a bar
that carries half 11 I'll be really
quick maybe what's new cheap videos in
the last rich ever thought of the day
you have one earlier you're thought of
the day richest thought of the day was
that he had his work Christmas party on
Friday and he said that he felt in
general that people were happier he's
looking around I never was happy
he's of this last year you didn't think
people were here Christmas
they were career in the recession wasn't
me yes thought more Christmasy more
festive my cab driver had a thought of
the day but I didn't think it was
appropriate to film him he was very
angry about this about the lanes near
Wembley that says like when there's an
event you can't drive in that Lane he
was like how you meant to know like what
counts as an event like how do you know
what's an event is if there's lots of
events in member Lee and he was really
angry that one thought of the day I'm
gonna sign up now tomorrow morning and
when I wake up and chill and edit this
vlog and then who knows what the day
holds but hopefully not much because I
want shell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
