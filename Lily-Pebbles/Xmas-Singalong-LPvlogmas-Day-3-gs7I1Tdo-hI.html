doing something very unblockable so I'm
back home now and welcome to vlogmas day
3 today like a beauty maintenance day
I've been to the beautician and I'm
going to have a pedicure this afternoon
I have two weddings this weekend and
only one pair of shoes that are
definitely open-toe and my feet are in
like real winter neglecting situation
going on down there right now I'm gonna
check my emails and do a bit of work do
a bit of planning I just remembered that
I haven't opened up my appetizers today
so I'll go do that now and show you guys
what I got
ok day three is a little peony and blush
swayed body and hand wash and then
Charlotte's Hillberry this one's always
much harder to get out number three this
is a wonder glow instant soft focus
beauty flash I don't think I've ever
tried the Wonder glow so that's exciting
I like getting a new product that I
haven't tried before
good Beauty pics from today I'm also
planning out my 2015 best in beauty
which is my like one video I do every at
the beginning of January to sum up my
favorites from the entire year and I'm
writing my list and honestly most of the
stuff is high-end just because I feel
like I love a lot of jobs or stuff but
if I was really to pick my absolute
favorites they more likely to be
high-end so would you guys prefer me to
throw in just a few drugstore things or
just kind of keep it as is and just have
one like epically luxury high-end yearly
favorites because I don't know it's not
so much like this is not so much like a
recommendation video just that honest
like favorites from the year so I'm just
writing up my list now I don't know when
I'll film that but it's hard to pick
like the best favorites in the year but
I think I've got a good list going
you're gonna know them all anyway
because they're all like the best things
from each monthly favorites video
you know I really want leftover pizza
from last night
oh yeah I've put my Charlotte Tilbury
Bond girl lipstick which I really like
and I'm gonna pop over to my sister's
for lunch because I didn't get to see
honey yesterday and I want to see her
I'm gonna have lunch there and then I'm
gonna go for my pedicure I'm so I did
put the pedicure it's unreal I just
tweeted this but I really just like
Christmas small chat like the amount of
people that are like so because your
Christmas presents yeah that's what it's
too early I'm just so not Christmas yet
I'm sorry for anyone who's watching
vlogmas to get in the Christmas spirit
but it's like the 2nd of December the
3rd or whatever it is it's crazy trying
to listen to smooth the Christmas radio
to get myself in the Christmas mood and
I am loving the Christmas music I feel
like the internet gets Christmasy way
earlier than like real life not all my
friends and family are even like
thinking about Christmas yet but all the
bloggers and youtubers they're like but
their Christmas trees they'll die if I
get my Christmas tree now it'll
definitely die by Christmas Day anyway
that's my Christmas thought for the day
this nation pays O'Connor Christmas
songs
I'm out JoJo's what is this oh my god
watching Balamory I'm just gonna have a
snack to eat and then I'm gonna go and
have my pedicure oh my god you do not
need all of these look how many other
condors they have how many dairy milks
all I want is one and you have three you
need for you where comes yours honey
in my heart
I'm here at cowshed now I'm going for my
pedicure absolutely heavenly seriously
if you want a good pedicure cow shed do
the best ones they just my feeling like
different feet seriously I need to learn
how to look off my feet better but it
was so relaxing they let you sit there
and let your nails dry for like as long
as you want and the chairs are so comfy
so I just closed my eyes and had a bit
of a rest and it was lovely actually I
think I'm gonna have the afternoon off
vlogging I'm gonna go and try on some
shoes see if I can find some shoes for
this we're doing this weekend and just
do a bit of mooching and probably not
vlog it because it will just be boring
montages shots but I'll come back to you
guys later but I'm gonna put smooth
Christmas back on and I'll see you guys
in a bit Christmas okay I'm just in the
carpark leaving the shopping centre
actually had a really nice afternoon
just kind of mooching and shopping with
my mom and it was nice not to feel like
I had to vlog but I met quite a few
viewers actually I met like three or
four viewers which was really nice and
I'll show you guys what I bought when I
got home because I did find a pair of
shoes oh I bought some fake tan from
boots just the San Tropez one but I'll
show you when I get home I'm gonna go
home now I'll start making dinner for
rich I'm really glad I made the decision
not to go out tonight because I'm having
one of those days sorry's complain I
have nothing to complain about I had a
really nice pedicure today but I'm
having one of those days where you like
drop something and then smash a lake and
then you just want to cry and everything
seems to be kind of going wrong I just
went to the supermarket to buy some
spelt spaghetti walked out supermarket
dropped the packet of spaghetti which
then decided to we didn't just drop on
the floor then I would have considered
eating it because obviously gonna boil
the spaghetti its splattered across the
whole floor like spaghetti all over the
street it was really quite a no he
decided to go buy another packet so I've
just come home and I'm just gonna sit
and chill for sec and I will show you in
a minute what I bought and then I'm
gonna crack on I'm gonna make spaghetti
err tomato sauce of Meatballs I think
rich is that some work drinks so
hopefully about tummy comes back dinner
will be ready so the first thing I
bought was the San Tropez tan and this
is kind of the only one I use now
because I find it really easy to apply
it's a mousse it doesn't stay wet for
long but I basically apply it leave it
on for a couple of hours and then wash
off which I like I don't like leaving
the product on my skin like you do with
the lotions I also think I'm going
through the hassle of tanning I wanted
to actually show up and this shows up
but it isn't streaky at all and doesn't
kind of come off in patchy so I really
like that tan and I bought a mitt to go
if there are definitely cheaper ones but
I just couldn't will to look around
boots for it so I got the sun's pay one
god I told you I'm dropping everything
now I thought I'd show you the shoes
that I got from office the problem I
have is I'm quite tall I'm 5 7 not like
crazy crazy tool but I'm tall enough
that I don't have to wear heels for a
high treason and I hate wearing heels
just because I never wore them as a
teenager when all my friends were like
wearing heels and getting used to them I
wasn't and so when I became an adult and
starts to having to wear heels to things
like weddings I'm just in agony and I'm
not the sort of person that would just
deal with the pain because it looks good
I'll just be miserable all night so it's
hard to find heels that are comfortable
and I find that like heels are like that
high just look a bit weird and they
don't flatter my legs I think high heels
are really flattering but they're really
painful and I find if I get a really
kind of clumpy heel then it's more
comfortable but then that doesn't
necessarily go with dresses and it's
always a bit of a struggle I do have one
pair of heels I like but I also wanted
to have some kind of smart flats then
maybe I can get away with wearing with a
dress for a wedding and I don't think
it's essential to wear heels to a
wedding I don't know where that kind of
rule came from but I don't think wearing
heels is kind of part of a dress code so
I wanted some smart flats and I really
like these they're from office this is
what they look like they're really
comfortable well so far they're like
paint and black lace-up they kind of
look like bronze but they've got this
cutout on the side which just makes them
a little bit smarter and a bit more kind
of dress appropriate I tried them on it
looks really nice but I haven't tried
them on with a dress yet so we will see
I think I might actually try the dress
on with the shoes just to see because if
Annie's hit in the back I might do that
tomorrow no this does not work why
there's something about flat shoes not
working with dresses oh it's so fun
raising I don't one away here there are
some dresses that actually does go it
this is like a silk dress from whistles
I know everyone says too casual for
wedding like I dress casual that's just
what I do and does go with this dress
but for the wedding I'm going to this
weekend and one of them is like proper
proper proper smart so I don't think
I'll get away with this unfortunately I
find it really hard when people have
like really really smart dress codes at
weddings like I get that you just have
what you want but when you have to let
my men have like higher dinner suits
it's just a little bit stressful but
I'll wedding the dress code is
definitely gonna be wear whatever you
want so this is the dress of mine it's
my friend's wedding in February it's
like my best friend this is needle and
thread is beautiful it's all like
embroidered and I love it so I'm just
trying it on with this one obviously I'm
not gonna wear these shoes to my
friend's wedding
but maybe this weekend I feel like with
this dress it's not that bad I know
people will hate it but for comfort
reasons I don't think that it's that bad
the dress is kind of nice enough that it
doesn't matter if I'm wearing flats I
don't know maybe I'll just take two
pairs of shoes with me I think the shoes
work with this black dress that's a
really bad will showing you from above
but I think that kind of looks alright
if I wear like a really bold lip and
those jewelry I'll look more dressed up
one of the most rewarding things about
what I do is the moment that I upload a
new video and the anticipation of what
the comments are gonna be like and then
when I start reading them if they're
nice it's such a nice feeling so that's
one of the main reasons I like vlogmas
because I get that feeling everyday and
it's really it's really exciting now and
I've got a new video up and there's
loads of comments to read and I feel
like I'm chatting with you guys every
day so even though it's been a boring
crappy day today it's so nice to read
all comments I'm watching everyone
else's blog misses on the TV while I
finish cooking dinner okay spaghetti
meatballs done it looks fine maybe not
the best thing ever but edible I'm
watching The Secret Life of
six-year-olds if you may start service
Secret Life of three year olds they
needed four and five and six and it's
the best program it's on Thursday nights
on channel 4 and it's so brilliant they
basically get all these kids together
and they put them in a nursery and they
film them and then two psychiatrists or
psychologists mmm not sure I know the
difference sorry for being stupid but
they
kind of assess them and it's just so
funny kids are hilarious so if you
haven't seen it watch it on for ID
because it's the most brilliant TV show
me and rich to sit here laughing the
whole time rich is home since we get to
your meatballs that I made he said that
he has a thought of the day yeah
what is it someone commented today by
the way saying don't really care about
the highlight of the day but definitely
want riches thought of the ditches this
one happened down the pub after work
this thought I came about and it's about
synchronization and it's about women's
synchronization oh how we're in sync
periods oh yeah Wow that's a to add
periods were like grass make I don't
know how but because it happens it does
happen if you spend a lot of time with
like another girl your periods will go
and sink yeah why how it says that your
question it's more a question though why
why does that happen
no one knows those were like it's the
pheromones releasing that good God I
really didn't think the thought of the
day would be about periods I mean you
know it caught me thinking if someone
let me know so I never eat the dark
brown Gillian I only ever have the light
ones I don't know I don't know why I
just assumed that they were like darker
chocolate are they actually all the same
yes are you sure I don't believe you it
don't you believe people to comment on
my videos can someone tell me with
whether they're all the same or not
I normally only these ones oh my god how
many of you had already rich I've won
and feel sick you eat like two in a row
we carry on watching six year olds
we're now watching I'm a celebrity get
me out of here yeah but rich hasn't
having a fast forwarding all the good
bits like Ant and Dec talkie bit buzz
there who do you want to win oh don't
lie don't lie did you want to win I
think why this is funny
okay so difficult evasion but phone for
I'm a celebrity get me out of here and
us Essex her skin is amazing imagine
what she did to it
okay yesterday's vlog was so boring and
I was in a bad mood all day and I'm
feeling much happier now that Rich's
home and I've had dinner and everything
I thought I'd show you my evening
skincare routine so that you guys would
like that I haven't done a video on it
for a while so I'm still wearing my full
face of makeup although it's not looking
too great so basically hovering over the
toilet right now I'm gonna start off by
taking it off my eye makeup one cotton
pad I'm so the sort first in the boat
refill my cotton pad thing let me just
get one no surprise first I'm in my
office okay I'm gonna take off my eye
makeup first because I'm wearing
eyeliner so sometimes when I've got like
black or dark colors I don't want to
smudge all over my face I think up
separately I'm gonna use my Clarins
instant eye makeup remover shake out
first the ones that are split into two
you always have to shake first to
activate I often see people are not
shaking it and it's just not gonna work
as well so I'm just gonna hold those
over my eye for a few seconds and then
swipe an don't drag too hard this area
around your eye is really sensitive so
you don't start dragging it yeah that's
pretty much removed like the bulk of it
but now you go
my eyes with my cleanser anyway so I've
already washed my hands really important
to wash your hands a free touch face and
I think I'm going to use my oski
Renaissance cleansing gel which is just
my favorite cleansing gel it's a gel
that turns into an oil once you will
start rubbing up the skins it's really
hydrating it's so nice it smells amazing
just rub that all into my skin and then
take a bit of my eyes just there's
always a bit of excess mascara taking a
muslin cloth I'm soaking it in warm
water I love the little muslin color
semi saved I'm gonna use tonight I'm
loving this Chi press like Kris brand at
the moment like he talking about
I'm use the moonlight or me moonlit
moonlight catalyst refine and renew
that's a nice noise I'm gonna take a
little bit of that and just work it into
the skin and then I'm just gonna take
some oil and I might leave it there I've
become really lazy with them I creams
and all that stuff but my skin is just
really enjoying this at the moment and
the oil seems to sort everything out so
this is the beauty elixir one it's got a
thousand roses in it apparently amazing
oil and that's it that's all I do at the
moment cleanse serum or something and
then I don't well this is my born
epilator that I use I still shave
sometimes but I mainly epilate and if I
can bear the pain and I never really
know until I try sometimes it doesn't
hurt sometimes it really hurts I think
it depends on hormones so I'm gonna give
it a go and I'm gonna do my arms this is
really sorry if there are any like
people watching that find this TMI but
oh well my arms are quite hairy at the
moment it's fine to have hairy arms but
I did this once just as a tester and I
really liked it so I thought I might as
well just keep going if I can although I
really haven't done it in a while so be
lazy and it's gonna hurt way more doing
like all of this at one time well then
if you just do it as the hair grows back
it doesn't hurt as much so that was very
silly of me let's just give it a go and
see
ok I'm done and it was not bad it's only
the first bit it's always painful my
arms always go so red and blotchy
afterwards I'm gonna do my legs now I'm
gonna leave it here because I really
don't sell vlogs beep about me removing
hair off my body sorry if this is being
a boring vlog actually I'm gonna say
sorry everyone has their days i i've had
actually a really nice day but you know
we just feel crap all day you can't
appreciate the niceness of it but
obviously my highlight of the day was
the incredible pedicure cow shed it was
amazing i really really recommend going
there thank you so much for watching day
3 and i will see you tomorrow the day
fleur de Flore day for vlogmas</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
