I'm aware I haven't blogged my face yes
because it's Monday and I can't deal
with Monday morning is that rich is
working from home today so can plug his
face I'm gonna have lunch actually even
though it's only 11:30 I didn't have
breakfast and there's like a salad thing
left over from yesterday I'm gonna have
this rainbow salad I love this from M&amp;amp;S
it's like my favorite salad rainbow
vegetable salad I'm gonna eat that and
then I'll probably get ready and I will
show my face then maybe I think it's
about time I put some makeup on I need
to head out this afternoon to get my
eyebrows threaded because I haven't done
them in ages I know a lot of you guys
comment on my eyebrows saying that I
should trim them and I should thread up
here I like the way I do my eyebrows I
will get them trimmed I don't like to do
it myself so I only get it done when I
go to get them threaded I don't like
doing the top because it means just more
maintenance to me because if that starts
wearing back and I've got a pluck it I
also think it makes overall eyebrows
look thinner this is my brows without
filling them in so they're not too thick
but they do fill in this top part I just
like the way I do it so that's how I get
it done I get the underneath that I did
and I get it a bit trimmed and the
middle threaded so I'm gonna go do that
this afternoon I'm gonna put on a boat
makeup though now not too much obviously
cuz I'm getting threaded and then I
think tonight we're having a little
barbecue it's why we had our first
barbecue last night because the weather
was really nice and I think it's getting
really nice today as well so we're gonna
have a little barbecue Nevada and potato
but all of you guys asked me to update
you on this Maria nila brand I found the
shampoo and conditioner that I used a
little bit too heavy you know a feeling
when your hair just doesn't feel quite
clean I haven't tried this mask yet
there but the shampoo conditioner I'm
not sure I'm a massive fan of I'm gonna
go get my eyebrows that's right in a
pretty sunny that it's really not a good
idea to go to a shopping center but I
would have been staying in anyway I got
my coconut water I'm just gonna head out
now I just wanted to quickly say
completely forgot it was exam season at
the moment I wish I'd known I would have
done a video about it but I just wanted
to say I just tweeted to say good luck
to everyone who has exams at the moment
just be confident be positive don't kind
of set yourself up my fate for failure
by thinking olive oil failed or I used
to do and just be calm and take the time
is always rushed my way get panicky
wouldn't read questions correctly so
just chill take it slowly and do the
best that you can do and be confident
and that's the best thing you can do if
I see my friend Hannah at some point
this week I'll see if she can give you
guys some tips on revision last in a
revision because she was really really
good at it
so if I see her I'll get her to do a
little bit in the vlog about that this
eyebrows done and this one is that you
could be the difference remember I've
logged this when I went to some as a
house the lovely brand oh dear send me
the list send me like third prepared a
paper so maybe we can vote to using this
I think hilarious some eyebrows all done
now and I go to blink brow bar I know a
lot of you guys think it's like crazy
expensive but they have a really good
loyalty scheme so I get it done for free
every now and again and also it's just
like it's like a hairdresser lie once
you find someone you trust you don't
really want to try like I've had some
really bad eyebrow experiences in the
past and I'm prepared to pay a little
bit more to make sure they don't mess up
my face cuz it's not like hair hair just
grows if you get bad haircut eyebrows
once you take too much away is so hard
to grow them back so I trust blink Baba
they always do a really good job for me
okay I'm aware I haven't really done
much today I've literally just been
working sitting at my desk and there
hasn't been anything to vlog but I want
to do something a bit different today
because I've been really getting into
snapchat and on Friday night when I was
babysitting with Keisha my sister
I found the setting we
can make it so anyone can send me a
snapchat which I didn't realize I could
do that and suddenly people were sending
through photos and videos and I can't
explain how it feels because you guys
see me all the time so you know exactly
what I look like what I sound like but
apart from meetups every now and again I
don't ever see you guys so it was the
most amazing feeling having videos and
like people from all over the world and
be able to see what you actually look
like and how you sound and how old you
are and it was so it was so much fun and
so interesting and so I'm gonna do a
snapchat now asking you guys or whoever
follows me on snapchat to send me a
video telling me your highlight of the
day so far and then I'm gonna film them
and put you guys in the floor because I
think you might also find it really
interesting to see each other and we can
be a little bit more like a little
community and it's really nice and it's
not just me all the time so I'm just
gonna film that now I have a favor to
ask you guys if you want to be in my
vlog tomorrow please send me a snapchat
video telling me what your highlight of
the day has been so far today Thanks
yeah I had to re-film it but this is
what is this is what it's like okay so
I'm going to post that now and then
let's see what happens
yeah this exciting I can't wait to savor
all the videos I don't know what my
highlight of the day will be today I
haven't done anything interesting yet I
will find something that it was my
mission every day I would find something

first you get idea okay now I'm just
planning a video tomorrow I am staying
at hotel for the night there's an urban
decay event at the Rosewood Hotel and so
I'm gonna stay there for the night and
I'm gonna film some videos while I'm
there I always take the opportunity to
film when I'm in a hotel
apart from Paris because I wasn't well
so I'm gonna film a video that I'm not
gonna schedule in because I'm gonna try
and make it quite cool and see what
happens in it normally when you do that
either
it is amazing or fails so I'm not gonna
schedule it just in case it fails and me
and I know gonna film our Beauty chat
video that we didn't film last week when
we were in Paris so I'm just planning
the video now and I'm writing a list of
all the things I need pack and take with
me
I think I'm gonna need quite a few
things I'm kind of planning the video
that I also just want to go with the
flow a bit like my day in the life one I
didn't really plan that and it worked
out really well so bit of planning a bit
of spontaneousness spontaneity that is
the word I meant and hopefully it will
work out all right okay so getting the
BBQ ready now and we're making fish I'm
having a salmon because this one's a bit
too fishy for me and we've got some nice
cool Jets over here we thought that all
the fish in our pond had died because
there was a herring that came and ate
them all where we had someone come and
clean the pond out today and a parent
there are two big fish left right at the
bottom of the pond but they're a bit
traumatized and there was a little foggy
in here earlier as well so what the pond
looks like covered it all up now so the
fish don't get eaten by the evil hairy
potatoes I've got the salmon I'm gonna
have some potatoes and salad and coax
dinner is delicious
and now we're going to cut up these
lovely peaches to have dessert so many
peaches I'm gonna go into the lounge and
eat these
we've got revenge to watch and I think
it might be the last revenge ever I'm
not sure so I'm gonna go watch that I'm
gonna finish my vlog here the highlight
of my day was definitely watching all of
your highlights of your days it was so
much fun and I've just been showing my
parents all Mike's like to think it's
amazing to see all of you guys on
snapchat and I hope he liked that little
segment on the vlog there's a little bit
long but I think that you guys would
want to see all of them as many as
possible so I wants to leave as many as
I could in there for you guys to watch
I'll see you tomorrow for another vlog
and thanks for watching this one I just
got a coffee from ginger and white
single shot latte it's all I can manage
was did you get with soy milk that is
like the most nutty bleep</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
