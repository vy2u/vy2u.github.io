where I left off it's the morning after
the premiere and it's Wednesday today
it's just a work from home day having a
bit of like a post holiday blog video
dry period I'm struggling to come up
with any ideas this always happens when
I go away it's very frustrating so I'm
just trying to get back into things and
today is my day of brainstorming ideas
taking photos etc so you haven't missed
much so far this morning I've just been
doing a little bit of editing's my vlogs
going up tomorrow and I've had breakfast
I had a bagel with butter and Marmite in
case you know I wondered and now I need
to do my morning skincare routine
because I haven't done that yet okay my
makeups done and I'm doing a specific
blog post today so I look very bronzed
and a little bit 70s it's quite over the
top but it came out well in photographs
I forgot to show you guys my sister made
me a loom band
I'm so happy okay it's about 12:30 which
is quite early to eat lunch but I always
get hungry early so I'm going to see
what's in the finish taking my makeup
off the games are a bit hard to work
with a full face of makeup hmm I just
laid out this wood I've got on the safer
and then I've got tissue paper a bit of
string and a few of like the images from
the campaign and I'm just laid them out
like this and I'm gonna take a photo
from above like this I think they look
nice and full I think full photos where
there's a lot going on and my favorite
types okay so I'm gonna attempt to do
some exercises today as you guys know
I'm not very good for my fitness I like
competitive sport but I'm not very good
when I'm by myself so last week when I
was with Anna she made me wear shouldn't
make me I wanted to but we went to buy
some weights and a yoga mat because she
said the exercises she doesn't YouTube
but really easy and fun to do so I've
got the chromecast thing already that
you plug into a TV so you connect your
phone YouTube TV so I'm gonna put this
like Fitness blender YouTube video on my
TV I've got my little mat here and my my
am 2 kg weights so let's see if I could
do this out at least
so I tried all mixer sizer I did those I
think I probably look stupid plated them
and then I just couldn't couldn't do the
ab work and then Bailey and honey came
around it distracted me and they were
hilarious as you saw and now they're
just dancing twofer ISM so that's what
happens in my house good morning guys
it's Friday and so far today I've just
woken up and have breakfast and done a
bit of work I now need to film two
videos and then this afternoon at my
heading into town to get my hair cut why
Ralph's breath I've just worked up like
one set of stairs let me just catch my
breath I was letting my hair grow a
little bit for holiday because when my
hair's curly it needs a bit of length
but now I'm back I need to get it
chopped again it needs like that much
off badly so I'm gonna head into town to
hirtius and salons get it chopped
it was very Mediterranean style lunch
today so I'm just off to have my haircut
and I'm really excited to get my hair
washed I also bought a new phone case in
Liberty so I've been looking for new on
pages and I thought this one was very
pretty and bright okay so I'm home now
and I've had my head chopped off there
looks very healthy he didn't put any
waves or anything he just blowed out it
straight so it always looks kind of more
me when I do it myself but feeling very
healthy and it was a good haircut like I
felt like he really knew what he was
doing but he was definitely a
perfectionist because he sectioned my
hair in some crazy way and kept making
me stand up and down to get it like the
exactly laden it was kind of a strange
experience but he was very good I'd
definitely recommend Harrison's I've
just put my new phone cover on and I
really like it it's like neon flowers so
I just found out that Ana has been
nominated for the blog loving blog which
is so exciting I think that's like the
best of wards ever and she's up for Best
Beauty blog I really hope she wins she
seriously deserves it so I'm gonna put
