or welcome if you happen to be new
today's video is going to be 10
self-care activities that you can do at
home that are super easy you can do them
right now to help you feel more
empowered more self-love more
self-awareness and just feel overall
better so hopefully you guys enjoyed
this video please give it a thumbs up
and let's get started
number one is to write a list of things
you want to let go of rent and letter to
yourself just break down things that you
are tired of stick up that you're doing
bad habits people you want to let go of
anything you want to let go this is
something I like to do all the time when
I feel like I'm doing bad things I don't
want to do I'm feeling bad about myself
which way does the flight or work and
after you write it all down I like to
fold the paper up and I like to burn it
like this and then I actually have a
candle on our porch because I literally
do that that often and you are literally
letting it go number two is to write an
empowered letter to your future self
even if it's just like almost from your
future self and read to yourself daily
so for an example I can write like dear
Lindsay I am so proud of the successful
successful kind kind ambitious young
woman you've become
I'm so glad you've worked so hard I like
pretending to write I'm really really
writing works so hard to make your
dreams come true you are so lucky to
have a fiance that loves you could put
husband so it's for a future tense
friends and family that's poor you and a
job that gives you financial freedom to
travel the world helps you influence
young females to follow their dreams and
helps you live a fulfilled life that
makes me feel so good and work on my
goals accomplish my goals
never I'm feeling down I'm feeling not
good about myself it reminds me from a
time when I'm in a great mood of how
much great things I have in my life and
it helps you kind of stop dwelling on
the negative and really focus on the
positive number three is to make a
vision board this is my vision board no
this is up here this is right in front
of her bed so every single morning we
wake up and we see these they say
visualizing stuff obviously keeps it in
your mind helps you manifest more
visualization it's key number four is to
meditate now I know I've said this a
million times the meditation is so great
one that I particularly learned in a
meditation class is to close your eyes
and breathe in 4 1 2 3 4 hold your
breath for 1 2 3 4 breathe out 4 1 2 3 4
and then hold again for 1 2 3 4 and then
you just repeat that as many times as
you like and that is meditating
sometimes when I find myself super
stressed out or anxious and I'm on the
go I will stop do that one time at least
a whole 16 seconds I guess and then I
feel even just in that 16 seconds so
much better number five is a 1-minute
visualization I have an entire video on
this but what I like to do is set my
alarm my phone for one minute and during
that 1 minute I just try to picture
myself in tons of different things that
I see myself where I want to see myself
doing within the next year such a quick
way to really feel good about your goals
it's also a really great way to manifest
your goals and keep them like on your
mind
number six is one that I actually
learned on a podcast from Daymond John
from shark tank and it's something that
he does every morning and every night
every night before he goes to bed and
every morning when he wakes up he lifts
out or says to himself six of his goals
he said he will do three short-term
goals maybe three for the day or three
for the week of the month and then three
long-term goals maybe one to five year
goals and he repeats them every morning
every night and they're on his mind
throughout the day and when he goes to
sleep number seven is to write down
three things you're grateful for and I
actually like to do this one
single day I don't always write them
down sometimes I say it to someone if
you have someone you can tell it to
that's even better you don't just want
to say I'm grateful for my health my
family my love and that move on you want
to say I'm grateful for my job that lets
me work from home and do something that
I'm proud of and that makes me feel good
about myself and makes me feel like I
can really help someone by putting these
videos out there and that I have such a
loving audience that is so supportive
and kind to me that's a good thing to be
grateful for or number two I can say I
am so grateful that today not I just
booked our flight to Greece for our
wedding that makes me feel so great to
be grateful for and when you are
grateful you'll find that everything
just seems to go more right in your life
so find your gratefulness write it down
and tell someone see what happens
Brie's an act of kindness now this does
not have to be some lavish extreme thing
it can be but it doesn't have to be
there's gonna be a little thing all the
time for example nobody's held the door
open for someone a minute ago or
whenever we're out about and I see a
stranger and I like their outfit or I
like their shoes or their hair I make
sure to stop and tell them never die
it's going to be clean something out or
clean something up
they say a messy life leads to a messy
mind and that's probably true whenever
the house gets really messy even just a
lot I feel extra stress and extra
overwhelmed so I try and keep everything
cleaned up number 10 is repeating a
mantra now honestly I'll be honest I
don't do this one all the time but Noah
does and he loves this one you can just
be walking to class in your head repeat
repeating I am strong I am strong I am
strong some people like to do multiple
like I am strong I am successful I am
happy I am safe I am loved I am healthy
just little things you repeating your
minds here when you're walking instead
of thinking about anything and
everything you think about little things
that make you feel better now honestly
this is a great one for anyone to do
because it is so simple but it's so
simple that I forget to do it so it's
definitely one to remember and I'm gonna
try and remember to do it as well
