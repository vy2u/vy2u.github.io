hi guys and welcome back or welcome if
you are new today's video is a hair mask
for you and not just your typical hair
hacks I mean maybe I don't know we'll
see this is going to be useful hair
hacks that actually do something for you
the work that are good for your hair so
little really be he's coming into my lab
you guys haven't seen him in so long say
I'm a big bully now we're still tiny but
like H full-grown he's no longer
clapping still a puppy but you know what
I'm saying
anyway in today's video is going to be a
hair 1/2 these are ones that I find
useful and helpful and good for your
hair we're is attacking my hand if you
didn't know I actually had a master in
cosmetology license basically I am like
certified and hair skin and nails I
don't really use it very much but for
things like this I do think it's useful
to give you the tips and tricks that I
know that's what I'm doing today number
one is clipping in your extensions
properly I used to just clip them all
over my head I would actually clip the
majority of them on the sides of my head
I would get headaches they would hurt
you would always be my clips but now I
found that you're actually both the clip
and the majority of your extensions in
the back of your head you sort of like
the nape of your neck and work up to
your crown and put most of the
extensions that way and then put a few
small ones in the front and that makes
it look more natural and they blend a
lot easier and you don't tend to see the
clips because they're hidden by the
majority of your hair my exit is to
tease over and under your extensions I
like to tease under every single clip
that way they have a nice grip and then
it what I like to do is not on not on
all the extensions just the ones I put
right here usually put two on each side
that's it I will keys on top of those
that way that nobody sees my clips and
then it looks like my sentence might be
real even though they're definitely not
next one is when you want to change your
hair part now I see a lot of people
telling you if you want volume just
change your hair part and for some
people it might be that easy but for me
if I just change my hair part it goes
right back to where it was the hair just
falls back over it it does not like to
change so a way to change your hair part
your hair is a little bit more like
doesn't want to work with you is to what
you're here first or when you get out of
the shower and then that changed
hair part look with a comb and then
blow-dry it just like that and then it
will stay if you have a color treated
hair the thing to do to keep it from
fading and is to rinse it in cold water
now doesn't have the ice cold but at
least cooler than like steaming hot
you'll notice your color will last a lot
longer the next one is a bit of a Miss
Buster if that makes sense now I'm not
telling you not to cut your hair but I'm
just telling you that cutting your hair
does not make it grow faster I feel like
people saying if you feel like your hair
is not growing or something cut it it's
not actually true your hair grows from
your Scouts not from the ends so cutting
your hair technically doesn't make it
grow any faster however cutting your
hair does make it look healthier and
look better and cutting off your dead
ends is still probably good for your
hair but it does not make it grow any
faster if you're going to make your hair
grow faster a good thing to do is trying
an inverted scalp massage which
basically just massaging your scalp you
can look it up and find more information
about it but it just causes more
circulation and more blood flow to your
scalp which is supposed to make your
hair grow a little bit faster now most
likely you have princess on before but I
had to include it if your hair gets
really staticky use a dryer sheet just
like you would use it in a dryer it gets
rid of static instantly using a good
shampoo honestly it's so important it is
kind of like hair food shampoo and
conditioner can really protect your hair
help it grow faster keep make it more
manageable I honestly recommend like
investing in a good shampoo more than
investing in some of those like split in
menders and stuff like that because
usually those don't work but a good
shampoo and a good conditioner can keep
your hair from getting damaged and also
help it grow and stay healthier a lot
longer next our vitamins I you probably
all heard of the sugar bear hair
vitamins I do take them but I'm not
going to lie to you guys and not someone
who's going to tell you something if I
don't really recommend it now I am
taking it in to our difference yes I've
seen a huge difference my hair has grown
really fast my hair has been really
manageable and it's also very soft
doesn't tangle sigh do you think if you
are looking for good vitamins the sugar
bear hair ones are really good however I
did take them to my salon and she
basically told me that for the price of
what you're paying if you look at the
ingredients it's basically just biotin
and b6 so what you could also do is just
go to the store and buy biotin and b6
which is kind of the same thing and a
lot cheaper so most likely when I
out of my sugar bear hair vitamins I
will probably save money and just buy
the actual vitamins instead next one is
don't overcook your hair I feed a lot of
people talk about this and it's a great
one you don't typically overcook your
food so why overcook your here think
about it with an egg an oven I've heard
miss Tiffany ma use this reference and
it was so great you don't typically put
your oven at 450 degrees unless you're
really cooking something so why would
you cook your hair at 450 degrees so try
and put your straightener or your
curling iron at a lower temperature it
will still do the same job and might not
fry it as much and also use a heat
protectant that is a must I think they
like to put conditioner all over my hair
but if you feel like your hair feels
really limp or maybe doesn't have a lot
of volume a lot of conditioners can
weigh your hair down so try putting just
your conditioner from maybe like your
eyebrows down and you'll see that you
might have a lot more volume in your
hair another thing is you can actually
curl your hair with a straightener a lot
of people talk about this but a lot of
people don't really know the proper
method so I'm actually going to show you
the exact method that I learned in
cosmetology on how to curl your hair
with a straightener and that's great
because then you only need one tool
especially in Europe when you're
traveling but one thing in your suitcase
if you don't want to buy both you really
don't have to okay so all you do is
clamp your straightener down onto a
strand of hair flip it all the way over
to the screen is back at the bottom and
then slide your straightener down the
strand of hair while slightly just
slightly angling your straightener as
you see that I'm doing so here I like
slightly turn it as I slide it down and
then wallah take it off and you have a
curl and last mounties if you find that
your curling iron or your straightener
isn't working as well try cleaning them
because your hair products that they get
all over your your like hair tools it
can cause your straightener and your
curling iron to not work as well because
it's covered in those hair products so
just take some like warm water and so
for some people use rubbing alcohol a
ton of different things you can use just
clean the metal part of your hair tool
you might see that they work a lot
better okay guys that is everything for
