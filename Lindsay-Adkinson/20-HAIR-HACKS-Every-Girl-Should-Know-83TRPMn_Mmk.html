and I know my background has literally
changed in every single video over the
past two weeks I just can't decide
exactly what I want to do I'm working on
it but I think this looks really good I
think I'm like looking at viewfinder
sorry but I'm like finally I don't look
ridiculously pale because I am pale but
I'm not that pale in my last video I was
looking like Frosty the Snowman or
something so it was a little much but
anyways today's video is 20 life hacks
for your hair 20 hair acts because yeah
I think saving time and saving damage
for your hair is awesome so yeah let's
go ahead and get right into the hex
number one is to put dry shampoo in your
hair the night before if you know you're
not going to have time or if you're just
not going to wash your hair the next
morning what that's going to do is it's
going to absorb the oils that are
produced while you're sleeping that way
it's not as oily when you first wake up
and also it's going to be a lot more
voluminous when you wake up and it's not
going to be so limp and lifeless so yeah
I definitely recommend putting dry
shampoo in the night before you go to
sleep if you're not washing your hair in
the next morning if you run out of dry
shampoo don't worry most the time I
don't even use dry shampoo I use a baby
powder
some people say you can use cornstarch
but I don't like using food products and
I hear that's a little that's a little
too much but baby powder is excellent
for dry shampoo just put a little on
your hands rub it in some scrub it to
your hair of your roots and then your
hair is going to be clean look clean
looking and clean feeling for the entire
day now whenever I do a fishtail I feel
like I missed so many pieces and by the
time I'm at the bottom I find so many
pieces in the back and that I missed
what you can do is put your hair into a
side ponytail first and then fishtail
braid your hair and then once you've
gone to the bottom and once you've
secured your fishtail you can take off
the top elastic and your hair is in a
perfect fishtail it was a lot easier and
you probably didn't miss as many or even
at or even any pieces of your hair if
you have thin hair you're wanting to
make your braid look a lot fuller all
you need to do is do a regular braid and
then pull the braid apart you can pull
it apart as much as you want that's
going to make it look a lot fuller and
like you have thicker hair and a thicker
braid if you want super full looking
curls when you're done I do this all the
time by the way flip your hair onto the
top of your head and hairspray the
underneath
of your curls let it sit like that for
just a minute and then flip it back over
and your hair is gonna be super full all
day I don't know how it does now I don't
know what it does I think it's because
your hair spraying the underneath so
it's kind of holding all together but it
works it makes your curls super full and
voluminous looking all the way through
and not just at the top using a towel
can actually be sort of detrimental to
your hair if you're someone who has
damaged hair like I do a good thing you
can do is use something that is made out
of cotton to dry your hair at instead
I'm pretty sure they do sell like cotton
towels online I'm pretty sure I've seen
that but what I like to do is which is a
lot cheaper and easier is use a t-shirt
use an old cotton t-shirt make sure it's
clean obviously wrap it around your hair
and let your hair dry that way it's a
lot healthier for your hair it's a lot
less damaging and not going to cause as
much frizz and yeah also when you are
drying your hair make sure to Pat your
hair instead of rubbing it padding is
actually going to dry it faster and when
you're rubbing it's actually causing
friction between your hair in the towel
which will cause your hair to become
damaged frazzled and frizzy if you have
color treated hair that you find is
raining pretty fastly try rinsing your
hair in cold water instead of hot water
or warm water I know that's what easier
said than done because no one likes
taking cold showers but when I had red
hair fades so fast so I washed my hair
in cold water and that would usually
make my hair go from having to diet
every six weeks to dyeing it every about
eight to twelve weeks as long as you
wash it in cold water another thing you
can do if your hair color fades really
fast is use coconut oil before you wash
your hair take a little bit of coconut
oil put it on your hair about an hour
before you take a shower and then when
you wash your hair for some somehow the
coconut oil like penetrates your hair
and it helps hold in the color while
you're washing your hair so less of your
color will fade out during your shampoo
bobby pins actually are made to go in a
specific way most people just take a
bobby pin like open it up and smack into
their hair trust me I do it all the time
but the correct way to do is actually
with a groovy side down the flat side is
not meant to hold any of your hair
it's just meant to be flat against the
top of your head also if you have extra
fine or thin hair and you find that your
bobby pins are still slipping out put a
little bit of hairspray on your bobby
pins slip it in and then it's going to
kind of coat it and make it stick here
and it's going to have a lot less chance
of it falling out you're most likely
gonna have that bobby pin in your head
the rest of the evening
another thing involving hairspray is
putting a little bit of hairspray on
your comb and then brushing it over the
top of your hair is going to get rid of
all of your flyaways because I promise
you I have so many flyaways that's what
I always do I just spray a little bit of
hairspray on my comb I brush it down on
my hair and then I'm good to go you can
also do it with the toothbrush but I
find a comb is better because I don't
want to put hairspray on a toothbrush
because I'd rather just use a comb you
know if your hair gets really staticky
all you need to do is take a dryer sheet
which is made for static in your laundry
hey hey and just rub it on the top of
your head and all your static is going
to be gone oh I've actually done this
for so long
I remember in like 7th or 8th grade
whenever I'd have staticky hair after I
straightened it I would run and grab a
dryer sheet and like rub it all over my
head and my static will be gone and
seventh or eighth grade was a long time
ago for me guys so I have really been
doing this one for a very long time if
you are out in public and you finds your
hair is getting frizzy or it's getting
like staticky what you can do is take a
little bit of your hand lotion because
most likely when you're out and about
you're not going to have like frizz ease
or a dryer sheet with you so if you're
if you carry a little bit of hand lotion
in your purse which I do anyways or if
not sure one of your friends will have a
little bit of lotion take a tiny bit of
hand lotion put it in your hand and rub
it through hair and that's going to get
rid of any frizz and it's going to make
your hair look sleek and smooth again
the next one is upbraiding your hair
before you go to sleep a lot of people
think you can just do a regular braid
and sleep on it for like waves but the
cool thing is no matter what type of
braid you do you can still make curls so
if you wash your hair the night before
pick any kind of braid you want if you
do a fishtail you can do french braids
you can do small braids big braids and
depending on the type of braid you do
that's going to be the type of curls you
get so if you do spin if you do it
little bitty braids all over you can
have really tight curls if you do big
braids you have loose curls you can do a
French braid and it's going to be curls
that start all over your head if you
want like an all-over curl you can do
fishtail braids which is going to give
you more of a mermaid look basically you
can do any type of braid
before with your hair wet sleep on it
you're gonna have some type of curl in
the morning it's a really cool way to
try out different braids at night to see
what kind of curls you like and what
kind of curls you can get curl your hair
from the middle instead of the bottom
and you're going to have longer lasting
curls think about it when you use a wand
your curls typically last a lot longer
and that's because you're curling from
the middle so it's getting a lot more
heat in the middle of your hair and when
you use an old type of curling iron and
you curl from the bottom the middle of
your hair is being curled last so it's
not getting enough heat so when you use
a wand or use any kind of curling iron
just try and curl your hair from the top
down instead of from the bottom a trick
I like to do probably my hair to be
super voluminous the next day is when my
hair is damp but not super white but
when my hair is damp I will throw my
hair up into a big bun on top of my head
I will sleep on the bun in the next
morning I will blow-dry my roots in the
bun still so my hair will be in a bun
I'll blow-dry my roots with the bun up
top take my hair down and I will have
lots of volume if you find that your
ponytail is limp and not very voluminous
you can take two bobby pins or even one
regular clip and just put it underneath
your ponytail it's going to give it a
lot more volume and a lot more OOP if
you hate that crunchy hairspray feel
when you put hairspray all over your
hair instead of spring the hairspray
straight onto your hair spray into your
hands first rub it through your hands
and then to put it through your hair
that way you're getting a lot less
hairspray but you're still getting all
over your hair and you're not going to
have that super crunchy feeling instead
blow-dry your hair with your head upside
down when you're blow-drying your hair
and you're standing up straight like
this you're actually just blowing your
hair flat onto your head but if you flip
your hair upside down you're blowing the
hair away from your scalp which school
which is going to cause it to be
variable luminous when you're all done
and when you flip it back over alright
