is time for my one month back squad but
basically 20 outfits for Beck school
aka my name is Friday outfits for an
entire month
now obviously let's first just scream or
I know everyone has different dress
codes I tried to make this outfit that
you can wear for college and also some
outfits that you wear for high schools I
get a little bit of both so somehow is
don't fit for your dress code I
apologize but hopefully have something
in there for everyone hopefully to have
a huge effect school giveaway going on
if you'd like to enter that stay tuned
to the very end of the video and I will
have all the links of at the very end
and let's go ahead and get started but
first off it I was going for more like a
grungy casual look so I paired this a
t-shirt is like rocker tea from
forever21 with a cutout with some black
jeans that I have like the holes in the
knees I got from Nordstrom Rack a while
ago and I just paired this with some
really cute shoes I got these from new
shoe I love these it felt like a good
combat boot vibe but they're a lot more
comfortable and they're not like going
to make your feet slide because they
have like the holes in them which is
perfect for the warm weather and then
he's added this rat bracelet that I got
from a brand called same sky what a
second outfit I decided to just pair
this denim skirt with a really cute
t-shirt that I got from Daisy LA and I
added a white belt just cuz I feel like
bells can look really like change up and
outfit and make it a little bit just a
little cuter I also paired it with my
plain white tennis shoes I love playing
white tennis shoes for so many different
outfits I have these from the brand
grace I think it's like great brand and
that has also added some simple bangles
from Charming Charlie
for a super lazy day I just picked to
some really cute navy blue like
form-fitting sweatpants not sure what
you call these you know it's either
called let me know in comments I can't
remember I also made sure they were
high-waisted because I paired them with
a really cute oversized t-shirt and I
tied it at the front just to make it a
little bit cuter and that added my
favorite slip farm just because these
are just the coziest and on like a lazy
day like this honestly comfort is key
and then I just added my hair and some
cute braids which i think is perfect for
lazy days and still looks cute and put
together and of course on a day like
this you need some coffee so I obviously
grabbed some iced coffee as well this
next outfit is super casual and perfect
for any grade or just anyone I just took
these plain light-colored pee jeans from
Topshop and appeared it with this really
cute Kim flossed t-shirt that I got from
PacSun actually has an alien on it but
it's fitting for my hair but it's super
cute and it's created with some white
tennis shoes as well
for a fun game day type look I took this
oversized Jersey t-shirt you can totally
use one for your own school or something
because you have one and paired it with
some all black leggings now I was
actually filming this in a not too safe
area and I realized I forgot my shoes so
let's just pretend my flip flops are my
usual white sneakers but yeah I totally
love this look this next outfit might be
one of my favorites I just paired those
same black teen skinny jeans from before
with a denim shirt that I got from
Topshop I love little bedazzles on top
and I spared this with some slip-on
black shoes something like vans would
also work perfect I got these from the
brand grace
for a girlier look this day I decided to
go with this floral bodysuit I love the
pale blue on this so pretty and I print
this bodysuit with some white skiing
jeans as well and then I also added a
brown belt these really cute like
Western booty these are probably my
favorite shoes and then it added some
cute bangles as well this next outfit I
took an oversized mob shirt and tie it
at the bottom for some Flair feel free
to leave it untied for your dress code
obviously and I also added a cube rolla
underneath just to add something a
little extra
and then I paired this with some gray
holey skinny jeans that I rolled up at
the bottom and my all white sneakers
this next book I call like edgy office
casual I don't know why just took my
black skin games you've seen many times
before and paired it with this striped a
button-up that I got from Express on
sale a while back and then I added my
same black slip-ons you've seen a
million times and a cool choker as well
also can you please look at rooster
digging under the door in this clip this
might be the cutest thing I've ever seen
the special I took a brown tank top
bodysuit and tucked into some destroyed
denim shorts for the links I actually
just followed the fingertip rule I know
a lot of schools use and these were okay
for me but obviously check with your own
dress code beforehand I know some
schools are super strict I also added a
cozy cardigan to cover up my shoulders
also for dress codes also how silly is
that dress code rule come on guys their
shoulders and I finished it off with
some flip-flops a necklace and a simple
valve was my style we have some serious
army Barbie vibes going on here I just
have these really cute camouflage ripped
up skinny jeans that I got from fashion
of last year but you can find like army
pants like this kind of everywhere and I
sprayed this with this really cute
Barbie teacher they actually got an
extra-large from a kid section and I
just paired that with these really cute
like combat looking type shoes that I
have and it also added my same wrap
bracelet from the same sky
for another edgy business cache type out
but I took these maybe blue cropped
pants that I got from Toby comm with
really fun zippers at the bottom and I
paired this with a fun trouble graphic
t-shirt from fashion OVA and tucked it
in with a black belt
super cute love this outfit and as
always I'm wearing my same white
sneakers but put some jewelry added a
black choker some huge silver hoops love
my hoops and a black bracelet as well
and tons of rings this next one may be
one of the cutest outfits I've ever worn
I did wear something like this on
Instagram and everyone loved it so I
made a more school appropriate version
for this video I just took this really
fun like racing graphic tee from fashion
Nova and paired it with my black skinny
jeans and slip-on but I also added a
really cute bandana in my hair for a fun
accessory
this house that I took my favorite
olive-green joggers and paired them with
a fun tucked in Guns and Roses t-shirt
that I got at forever 21 a long time ago
and I paired this look with my white
sneakers and a few gold chokers
this next up it might be one of my
favorites I just paired of these brown
suede pants that I got from Express this
is really pretty slow a white top it
actually is a little too low-cut so I
did add a a for all let but you might
want to add a pink up for your school I
actually just totally have any tank tops
anymore now that I'm out of school but I
probably should get some for these types
of videos but anyways I just paired it
with some really cute sandals and that
was pretty much it for this element next
for a sporty or vibe this day I took a
bright orange hoodie and a fun story I
ordered it online it actually did not
have a hole in the hoodie in the photo
online but it did come in like this I
didn't really have time to send it back
for the video let's just pretend it's
not there yellow but I wore some all
white jeans and some orange and white
Nikes and added a chunkier necklace as
well
for something a little dressier but
still comfy I opted for this bodycon
dress it's pretty long that I got from
PacSun actually tied it in the front
just to make it a little bit shorter but
obviously if you have a dress code and
it doesn't allow it you can leave it
untied and I just paired it with some
flat booties that I have from Matisse
from a long time ago and that is pretty
much it this next outfit actually has
some help from you guys to help pick
this out I just chose these straight
pants from fashion OVA they're so fun
and colorful I love them indicated with
this flowy white tank top from Hollister
and then some tan booties that I have I
don't have no idea where these are from
because I had some fun Bengals and from
Charlie and this purse I have from
agachi plus next one I just took this
rose gold metallic really pretty romper
from Windsor and I paired it with a
kimono that I got from free people that
I've literally had for like five million
years because I spent way too much on it
and you guys know how cheap I am and I
refuse to get rid of it but hey it
totally works for this look and then I
just paired a really sign of black
children with this and these really cute
fringy black sandals that I got from a
zoo shoe
this last thought of it may be my
absolute favorite I just took these a
pink mauve shorts that I got from
fashion OVA as always make sure they
will fit your dress code and I added
just really super freaking cute over the
shoulder bodysuit I also got from
fashion OVA but just in case I did add a
bralette underneath because it doesn't
have anything on like the shoulder area
obviously if this does not go to your
dress code you could do like a sicker
tank top or something like that or maybe
just do something that still doesn't
cover your shoulders because dress codes
are crazy sometimes who knows why and
then I did a ton of jewelry to make this
super fun and girly I had three gold
chokers I added a Q watch and I paired
it with my same white sneakers in a
really cute purse all right so I hope
