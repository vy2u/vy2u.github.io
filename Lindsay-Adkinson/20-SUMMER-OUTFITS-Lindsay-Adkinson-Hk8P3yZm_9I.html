ahead and get started
so for outfit one I started off with
this really cute tie front flowy top
that I got from princess Polly and I
paired it with some comfy white shorts
and some white sandals this is perfect
like a beach day or just a day when
you're out shopping or honestly kind of
anything out the - something I plan to
wear in Italy it is this really cute
polka-dotted
wrap dress I love flowy dresses in the
summertime to keep you really cool and I
paired it with some white tennis shoes
you could also do heels but I love
tennis shoes and dresses it makes the
dress also very a function a perfect
airport outfit or maybe running errands
outfit is a comfy 2-piece set this one
has a skirt but it's actually really
comfortable and very easy to move in I
got this from fashion Nova and I love
the bright mint color and I also paired
it with my same great white tennis shoes
a really cute but casual outfit if
you're still wearing jeans in the
summertime are these cute ripped up
jeans I got from can-can and then I
paired with a fun a flowy frilly white
tank top that I got from forever 21 in
my really casual super dirty slides
I love sets like this especially for
nights out you don't have to worry about
your outfit or have to worry about
trying to put something together cuz
it's all good and ready to go this one
is from edgy shop I'm pretty sure it's
sold out but I'll find something similar
and link it below and then I paired it
with some really cute white booties
a staple summer outfit for me is a cute
pair of cutoff shorts and a tied-up
white button-up especially if I'm going
to the pool I will put this over my
swimsuit and I also paired it with some
white booties but obviously if I was
going to a pool I would just grab some
flip-flops off the shoulder tops were
extremely in last summer and I do not
think they're going anywhere anytime
soon I love this one from Urban
Outfitters that I paired with those same
white shorts and my white tennis shoes
another fun set this one is more of a
casual one a perfect for like a music
festival or just an outdoor event this
one is also from princess Polly it is so
cute and fun for summer I love the
orange color and just some white sandals
to go with it now rompers are a must I
love simple easy throw on rompers this
one is floral and frilly from Nasty Gal
really nice for like a family event and
again my same white tennis one of my
favorite outfits
I love these pink tie-up shorts and that
is paired it with a black tube top I
love tube tops especially with like
kimonos but I just paired this one with
that one and I added my black platform
slides and some fun black sunglasses
fruit print is so in right now and the
bright fun print is so perfect for
summer I love this lemon tube top that I
got from forever 21 and then I just
paired it with my same white shorts
these are also by the way from forever
21 and I've had them on and like almost
every outfit they're like eight bucks
and then my same staple white tennis
shoes if you're looking for something a
little bit more edgier I have this
cutoff plaid button-up that I got from
again forever 21 and then I have these
thrifted high-waisted shorts and my
high-top vans which I honestly wear
these like every day they are so
comfortable and go with almost anything
this is pretty much my everyday staple
outfit in the summertime I just took
those same high-waisted shorts I
thrifted with my same a high-top fans
and I took a really fun t-shirt and tied
it up you guys love when I wear outfits
like this whenever I wear them on to
Instagram they get the most saves and
likes out of all my photos definitely a
staple in my wardrobe is such a fun and
cute a simple everyday outfit and it
skirts have been super in lately so I
have this really fun red black and white
moto skirt from beginning boutique I
just paired it with a really cute red
tank top and then those same black a
platform slides that I got from Steven
Madden I love this super cute denim
skirt that I found from Abercrombie it
honestly goes with so many outfits from
super casual to super dressy I paired it
with this really fun floral yellow
ruched top from PacSun and these cute
little wedge slides I don't know where I
got them from but you can honestly find
these everywhere right now super easy
way to grab an outfit out the door is
some cutoff shorts a really cute blouse
this one is from princess Polly and some
flip-flops and some sunglasses perfect
for a casual on-the-go day in the
summertime a cute tank top I got this
one from PacSun those same shorts my
great white tissues and a cute little
backpack that I got from a little
Shoetique perfect for carrying around
your wallet maybe a camera some snacks a
water bottle whatever you are doing for
some summer activities this next stop is
one of my favorites even though my hair
looks like a mess in these clips but the
same shorts I paired with a plain white
t-shirt some slides and your really fun
grey hat I've been really into hats
lately because one they protect your
face from the heat and also they keep
your hair from fading in the heat if you
have colored hair like I do I also love
really casual dresses appeared with
something tied around my waist like a
jacket or this really cute denim jacket
that I have and I also use my same white
tennis shoes and this dress is from a
fashion oba in a super super soft and
flattering
and last but not least you have to have
an everyday pool outfit I love dressing
my swimsuits up when I'm heading to the
pool especially if I'm not getting right
in the water I just use this really cute
like scarf type thing that I tied around
my waist like a skirt added some cute
flip-flops and a really fun Beach hat a
beach bag is also a must but I forgot to
grab one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
