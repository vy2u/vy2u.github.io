welcome with your our new my name is
Lindsay Marie say feels going to be a
little different than usual I mean not
that different all my videos are kind of
different
they say there's going to be 21 if you
know 20 or 21 things that I think every
20 something-year-old needs to know now
I just turned 24 also real quick make
sure to stay tuned to the end for a
little bit of an announcement and yeah
let's go ahead and get started make sure
give it a thumbs up if you don't mind as
well boys do not solve your problems
that is something and it's so hard to
learn I don't know why it took me so
long but boys are never going to be the
answer I jumped in and out of
relationships for so long I searched for
relationships I begged for boys I want
him to feel the same way about me as I
thought I felt about them to learn right
to love myself the way I wanted a guy
love me for myself to ever really be
loved by someone else for me to know my
Worth and find the right kind of guy you
have to love you first go out of your
way to make friends because we all want
friendships I remember when I started
college all the time I see girls like
know hanging out and I didn't really
have friends through college and I was
like ah they probably don't to be my
friend
oh I probably don't want to talk to me
but they probably do most of us want new
friends more friendships and want to
meet new people and to talk to people
and communication so if you want to make
friends with people make friends first
you want to wait for someone to be come
up to you or talk to you we are all just
as nervous on the inside are all scared
about these kind of things and we
shouldn't be we should all just want to
be friends with everyone it's completely
and 100% totally acceptable to dance
around your living room and your
underwear it is like the key to life to
have fun isn't it it is also completely
acceptable to have days where you just
want to order takeout
and binge watch a TV show all day I have
had those days I still have those days I
used to think it was bad to have those
days I wasn't allow them we are allowed
in life is hard let yourself do the
things you want to do it is absolutely
okay to cry for no reason at all most
likely there is a reason most likely
there's lots of reasons you're probably
like picked up all these emotions and
angst and stress and worries
we bring on to ourselves and it's okay
to let it out I used to think I was weak
and I pride but I realized it's not I'm
not weak you're not weak we are not weak
we are strong life is tough and
sometimes I cry really fixes your
problems I'm not saying you should try
and cry but if you need to cry girl let
it out it is not your fault if someone's
mean to you or doesn't like you it's
their fault it's their problem so don't
even worry about it it's not your it's
not even your issue next is to one by
the shoes but also learn to save your
money
you guys you deserve to buy the shoes or
the things you want but you also got to
realize it's kind of irresponsible and
also start to say for the important
things in life
next is eat the cake that you want to
eat but also eat your veggies so if you
can tell us and Alaska what I'm trying
to tell you is learn to balance things
clean out whenever you can if you can
clean out old clothes old shoes old
makeup old job from your dong tours to
and cleaning out get rid of bad mojo and
bad juju and just bad feelings in fact
vibes and it just feels so good and
you'll feel so good just clean out all
the things that don't bring you
happiness so let go of inner baggage it
is never going to benefit you or anyone
else to hold on to all the bad things
that have happened or all the crappy
things that have happened because we all
go through crappy times I used to lean
onto my bad experiences at the crotch
like oh no I can't do this because this
happened to me that you know when I was
younger that is the bull crap it is bull
crap and we all know it we we can be in
great relationships we can make
friendships we can trust people we can
love we can do so many great things it
doesn't matter what happened to it does
matter first off know your feelings are
valid they are valid but you got to let
them go you got to forgive you got to
forget and you got to move on work on
yourself grow yourself because you
should always be blooming and growing
and bettering yourself but also give
yourself great because know that
yourself is right where you should be
and don't strive to you don't have to
strive to be perfect or perfection of
yourself grades and know that you are
doing what you can you are doing your
best while you continue to grow yourself
and give yourself just a little bit of
room a little bit of a pat on the back
every now and then this one seems a
little harsh
maybe I hope not but your beliefs your
bow
you your thoughts are never are never an
excuse to be mean to anyone else never
because just because you were grown up
to think something and someone else was
growing up to think something different
doesn't mean the other right to be mean
to them belittle someone we have no
right we were never given the right to
be mean to people to put people down to
make them feel were like not worthy
because we have different values
opinions beliefs thoughts we are all
different we're all supposed to be
different there is so much beauty and
difference and uniqueness and the
difference of life we should all be okay
too we should all feel allowed to be
ourselves and be proud of ourselves and
be confident we should always be kind of
each other for no matter what because
difference is beautiful uniqueness is
beautiful
kindness is beautiful and kindness is
free the next one is dressed how you
want to draft wear what you want to wear
do what you want to do if the old ladies
stare at you and give you me to look in
the grocery store let us let them it is
your time to live how you want to live
and wear what you want to wear oh just
do what you want I spent too much time I
literally used to change my outfit if
someone thought like I look at
appropriate or if I looked you know
stupid I'd like oh I shouldn't wear this
ever again because they comment on my
outfit no girl dress how you want to
dress rock it
it is okay to not like something it is
okay to figure out what you like and
don't like I don't like wine I don't
really like to out like alcohol but I
still like to go out and dance so the
longest time I thought I couldn't go out
with my friends because they were
drinking I don't really like drinking I
get hangovers with like one drink one
drink and I'm literally pooping the next
day so I realize I can go out and I can
dance with my friends and not drink and
they can drink and dance mad at the time
but we can all have fun you get you're
allowed not like things and you're
allowed to spill hope to learn to not
like them probably make time for your
family make time for your family or your
mom your dad your brothers your sisters
your grandparents because they're not
always going to be here we're not always
going to be here and I had to learn this
one too like I moved from Georgia to
California and in that in the last two
years I've seen my family twice on
Christmas and that
this so I used to make sure you make
that time for them I have to make sure
like even if I think I'm too busy for a
phone call
I'm not make the time to call them and
visit and then go to your brother's
football games and do those things and
you can whenever you can because those
things matter which leads to my next one
and that is getting your priorities in
order
know what matters the most view even if
you have to write a list know what
matters the most what matters the least
my priority just to be so wrong it used
to be you know making sure everyone
liked to me making making sure I was
getting views on YouTube making sure
someone look at mad at me and then it
would be you know my real relationships
and friends and family know it's got to
be loving yourself your friends your
family your relationships it is
absolutely okay to not have everything
figured out I do not have everything
figured out you know there's beauty and
the journey of life not in just where
you need to be so trust your process
trust your journey trust your path
because it's all going to be okay and
it's okay to not know every single
answer and everything you think you need
to know right now next one is comparison
sucks it sucks
it is never going to help you it is
never going to help anyone or any
situation you've got to stop thinking
just because someone else is so maybe
farther than you think that you aren't
far enough because you have to idolize
yourself the way you idolize other
people or you're never going to love
yourself well you need to love yourself
think about what you have and what
you're doing and you'll notice that
those things will start to flourish and
become so much better and so much more
of what you want will be there when you
focus on what you have and now it's not
what someone else has the next one is
taking your own advice and obviously I
mean this to myself as well if you find
that you're always telling your friends
to love themselves and don't settle and
you know put themselves first and go
after their goals wholeheartedly
maybe you should also think am i doing
those things they say that often the
teacher teaches what they need to learn
and I really believe that I teach all
these things about love and passion and
kindness but I also have to remember to
remind myself to do those things as well
and last but not least is to live it up
when I told someone when I talked about
my age with someone and they're also 24
they're like oh my gosh don't
everyone our age they're going taking
poor to old that we're getting old I'm
like what no we're not you are as young
as you feel
leave it up this is the time to do what
you want live your life do what you want
to do go after your goals don't settle
love yourself love others be happy
because let's goes by super fast and you
deserve to feel worthy of all those
things so I hope you guys enjoyed this
