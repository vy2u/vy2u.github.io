don't blame me Matt I'm gonna be
colorful AF maybe I'm just trying way
too hard to make this cute let's just
let's just say it's enough hey guys and
welcome back to my channel or welcome if
you're new today's video is going to be
a testing / to try on haul from romwe
your girl spend way too much money and
I'm pretty nervous but I'm also pretty
excited okay I mean like look at this I
got all stop I got a lot of stuff so
Mike should give this video a thumbs up
and let's go ahead and get started okay
so the first thing is this yellow like
almost cropped hoodie not gonna be like
a crewneck and then it's got these
really cute like rose floral sleeves
Jeff wasn't sure if I was gonna like
them when I first opened this but on
this is totally cute I'll totally wear
this like this is so cute even with
these jeans let me see if I can like
zoom me out or something I don't know
about this it's like I like the sleeves
okay the sleeves are cute I like these
kind of sleeves but this is just really
like like kind of big on me which is
fine if it's like a sweatshirt this is
it supposed to be like a like a
form-fitting like cute sure I feel like
I could wear this like with these jeans
right yeah I feel like I could wear this
with these jeans and it'd be kind of
casual kind of mix like a plain
long-sleeve t-shirt look a little cuter
I think I just thought it supposed to be
a blouse not t-shirt but more like a
t-shirt with some style I know you guys
are all probably thinking what were you
thinking I remember seeing this whole
the website and thinking like why am i
why do I like this I don't know but I
like it maybe it's because I've never
really gotten a sweater season guys and
I wanted to go all out I wanted to go
all out I wanted every color of the
rainbow on my sweater and I got it
again this sweater is surprisingly very
thick thicker than the last one
girls gonna be warm toasty it's already
a little too hot but I like this one I
really like it now at first I put it on
and I was like what was I thinking but
then I looked at over
second I was like I was thinking I'm
gonna be colorful AF yeah I couldn't do
that I'm not sure why I just tried that
um but I do like this I like all like
the colors on the neckline
I like the colorful sleeves and the
front I just think this is fun okay
drives me all you want I think it's fun
I think it's cute I like it
don't you in this okay I will give this
one an 8 out of 10 I feel like this is
cute for fall I feel like this is pretty
cute for fall I like the bell sleeves I
kind of like the pattern I don't I don't
hate it like I didn't like up close I
don't like this but like this
what do you think I'd like this one and
it's different for me too it's not
something I would typically wear but I
feel like this is hue like oh no no how
do you even can eat can you eat honey
okay do I have backwards I don't think
so but it's at home I'm gonna try
turning it around let's for training
around but I don't I don't know if
there's any reason this is definitely a
no and not even for looks as I might
have it on backwards but like it is so
stiff this is not happy material I don't
know if I got the wrong size but like
whatever why why are there two buttons
right here on to the shirt I forgot
about this I didn't know this was how
this worked okay let's see what what
what okay so to be fair it does look
pretty similar to the photo I guess I
mean it's a little different I mean this
is like it's similar but these buttons
aren't as huge is that these are here
either way it's definitely not
flattering on I definitely wouldn't wear
it there's a few issues like there's
tons of little threads like coming out
kind of everywhere
for the buttons maybe maybe it's the
buttons I maybe I'm just trying way too
hard to make this cute let's just let's
just say it's a No
we'll just say no we'll move on okay so
this next one is just really cute like
tight fitted sweater with a big like
bloc yellow a black stripe thing going
on here and then it's got like a really
cute like cutout collar and same for the
sleeves I like this one so the material
feels really nice it feels really nice
and it looks really cute on I like this
I really love the neckline it will
totally wear this this is really cute
simple good I like it okay so the next
shirt is this blouse it is a little seat
there but let me tell you about it first
bad sure it's like okay it's just that I
think this is supposed to be like a
choker neckline I have you seen it's
pretty loose oh it kind of is kind of
matte hey man it just kind of hangs you
know so I don't think that's super
flattering if you could like get this
back here like I don't know like pin it
back it might be a little bit cuter and
the only other thing I really don't like
about this is the material it's that
same material as that oh there sure
that's like really stiff and it feels
like if you were to move your arms up
too fast I would rip and that's not cool
that's not cool okay so next I just had
this like loungy striped sweater
guys this is doing it for me I like this
yeah I like things that are like casual
and comfy like this this is really
comfortable it is pretty soft and it's
actually surprisingly very thick I was
expecting this to be like one of those
really thin sweaters that are like it
looks like a sweater but it's really not
going to keep your warm no this is
actually pretty warmly I'm actually kind
of sweating now
I love the stripes this is cute I think
this is cute I would totally wear this
also the slightest driving me nuts it's
warm its cozy okay
this one I am not mad about I'm glad
about okay okay haunt me drink some my
soda I'm sniffling I'm thirsty
all right all right this is what we're
working with this is just a big yellow
what are these kind of shirts called up
button up it's just a button up oh look
an eye kept pointing knew that okay it's
just a big yellow button up I really
like the color yellow the mustardy
colors right now let me look in here I
like this it does have a few low strings
coming off but I like it it's very
valiant stuff but I feel like if I
didn't have it buttoned up up with a
tank top on this could be really cute I
actually really like the pocket detail
because it's got like all the frayed
detail going on out on but I like the
material it feels nice it's not stiff it
definitely feels like you can move
around I can move I can groove I say yes
I vote yes I look really short I am
really short this feels really company
by the way this is a very Kyle of this I
love this
oh my gosh this is so cute okay
definitely in a cute card again very
stylish very cute material I need to
like make it where you guys can fully
see this deep red and black oh it is
birth it's a soda not my fault
don't blame me go away okay anyway
bottom line is I like this it's cozy
it's casual it's comfortable nah not
this much cereal again okay what what
okay what what is this I want to check
my phone to see what this looks like
online there's no way I bought this
right no I think it was supposed to be
this long in this color I did something
you're supposed to be this much material
this could literally wrap my whole body
a few times
aha aha I found it okay so here is a
picture of it on the website
it's supposed to be one of those like
one-size-fits-all we all know that is
such a dumb thing okay so these are 1489
some black ripped skinny jeans oh my
gosh look at these okay so I am so
impressed these pants were $14
they're extremely high quality they look
just like the photo they feel really
good they look really nice I will
totally be buying their pants again
I am extremely impressed with these
jeans what do you guys think
okay so pair of jeans number two also
sorry there's like trash everywhere from
a triangle and stuff on also really
impressed okay so I will confidently say
I will probably be buying more of their
denim
I'm very impressed in those two pairs of
pants
I love these I love these okay so the
next item is just as oversized like
mustardy t-shirt dress I'm actually
usually a the opposite of a fan of
t-shirt dresses on me I usually think
they look really bad buy notice online
this one was made kind of be like it's
definite sense at the waist but it's
smaller most teachers are just like
on me this one has got a little bit in
and before it goes out this is cute I
think this is cute I can wear this was
some cute like brown boots for the Fall
okay so this is good quality it's soft I
like the cut of it I like the feel of it
I like the fit of it I like this okay so
I hate in on a bad no but like it's what
I was taking the photo so what it is
definitely a baggy err jumpsuit I will
admit and also I don't think the buttons
were supposed to have holes so that's
fine
it's just not the same I like I'll make
show you see what I'm saying just it's
way too big off first I was way too big
and I got the smallest size so I have
the small size still way too big and
it's weird because the band part where
goes around your waist
this is perfectly tight how it's
supposed to be it's just the pants are
too big and the top is too big I just
think I'm gonna have to say you know to
this in a zipper
I can't get it to zip so it's like a
hole right here hope you see that I
can't get it to zip up I don't know if
it's oh so I think I just forgot to put
the zipper part there yeah so the
zippered just there's a zipper here but
there's no thing to zip this is gonna
have to be a no for me this is a
definite now this is so this is pretty
bad but now this ah be my least favorite
thing I got just because it's not that I
picked out the wrong thing this doesn't
it looks similar to the photo but the
guys you can tell they copied something
from something from like somewhere else
but it's not the item in the photo it's
definitely not but just say buyer beware
if you're gonna buy stuff know that
there is a risk definitely look at the
items maybe look at the reviews of the
items I did notice that a lot of the
things I liked did have reviews of
people saying they also liked it look at
reviews people can also submit them
submit photos of themselves wearing
things but sometimes you get something
really nice but sometimes you get this
and you're like hey girl nah okay guys
that is it for my try on around
whitehall I hope you guys enjoyed it let
me know in the comments what are your
thoughts do you want to see another one
