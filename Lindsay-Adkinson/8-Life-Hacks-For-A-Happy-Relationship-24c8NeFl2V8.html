our welcome if you you are new today's
video is a relationship hack that's are
just things that make your life easier
and I think having a happy relationship
if you're in a relationship makes your
life easier also today's video is
sponsored by you cam fun which is a
really fun app that I'm going to tell
you about really quickly so you just
want to open the you cam fun app and you
can go to the fun cam and take photos or
videos with tons of fun and unique
filters they have so many to choose from
you can also upload them to Instagram
Facebook and more also you can go to
photo fun and play around the photos
you've already taken you can add fun
animal filters you can put your photos
and different scenes and even different
frames you can also play around the
light filters and the grunge filters to
make your photos really really artsy I
think the light part is definitely my
favorite in the app so definitely check
out you can fun if you haven't already I
will put a link to the app down below
this video is also a collab with Nicole
doing testing life hacks and DIYs Parris
and Roxy doing secret exam hacks
Courtney doing DIY emoji stress balls
Kerri doing a DIY mermaid hair Laura is
testing out like tough Halloween makeup
Lauren is doing it life hacks for girls
and Savannah is doing 25 DIYs real quick
also before we get started no one I have
a vlog channel makes use video a thumbs
up and let's go ahead and get started
number one decisions can be a really
tough in a relationship I know we have
spent times arguing over where we're
going to go eat and that's that's
pointless so make a decision game out of
your decisions instead of just sitting
there like arguing over it arguing about
it over and over
make a game at like what what we'll do
is we'll pick five places first and then
he will narrow it down to three places
and then I will narrow it down to one
place I don't know babe ready oh my
goodness we can't pick why don't we just
do pick five okay um Chinese Mexican
Panera KFC or pizza
let's do pizza KFC or Panera Panera
alright the elephants good
so the second hack is turning tours into
a favor so Lindsey actually hates doing
dishes and I hate vacuuming so usually
we just switch it up I'll do the dishes
for and she vacuums
everything works out I'm not doing this
I'm actually not doing this I'm actually
not doing okay so another thing is to
take each other out go to the movies go
to dinner go wow it's always fun um but
you guys don't always have to split the
bill and the guy always doesn't always
have to pay for it either
yeah you can make it fair you can make
it fair um it just makes it easier and
makes relationships work better if all
the pressure isn't on one person and you
take turns is no I usually pays more
than I do he does he's a gentleman but
you know sometimes it's not fair if
after like years and years of a knee and
one person is paid for everything that
can give a little hefty on one person
different is to use gift-giving
occasions or holidays a new meaning a
lot of times holidays can turn into
competitions on who buys a better gift
to buy the more expensive thing turn it
more into who can have the most fun with
it
this year we have set a very low fifty
dollar limit and also it can be
something you make have to have a lot of
meaning and you can't go with it over
fifty dollars that way we can't compete
it's not anything like we're not doing
anything spiteful but who gets something
better
this will be fun and we're gonna enjoy
it and stops gonna have a lot more
meaning behind it the next one is more
of a hack style one and this is to take
a break in the middle of fighting think
of a common ground word think of a safe
word that if one of you says it in the
middle of an argument you have to pause
the argument for 15 minutes so what
that's gonna do is give you time to calm
down rethink regroup and usually at the
end of those 15 minutes you're gonna
wonder like it's just argument even
worth it you'll most likely be a lot
calmer and it's gonna be a lot easier to
resolve relationship so think of a
fighting or argument safe word shut up
like you just stop talking about it you
just never listen to me you've never
agreed it was nonsense you talk about
garbage all the time yeah I swear to God
maybe if you'd actually listened yeah
yeah I mean okay so the next one is also
to reward honesty and courage courage
there's a lot sometimes it's really
tough to tell each other embarrassing
things about yourself or to open up or
to tell each other hard things you know
it's hard to share with other people but
I make it where it's fun to share those
things so every time make it a rule make
it an honesty or courageous rule that if
one of you share something really open
or personal about the other person about
yourself to the other one that you're
going to get more
with ice cream we're a back massage I
like back tickles game yeah you remember
in the car earlier and it's not kind of
mad yeah okay it was me i cued it babe
I know I can't help it yeah that was so
strong I make it honest let me make it a
back people right yeah it does another
hack is to try not to correct your
partner when they make a mistake um I
never sing song lyrics right
I always make up my own words and on I
Lindsay sometimes that's a hard time not
correcting me I know it hurts or not you
know better is our relationship concrete
jungle wet dream tomato hey what hey
that's what you know what it was great
that's great thanks I appreciate it and
the next one and probably the last one
is to make a bucket list because
sometimes after a long time of being
someone you're gonna get bored during me
doing the same thing just so good I love
each other but you might need something
new to do so make a bucket list as long
as soon as you want you can add to it
whenever you want and every time you
guys get bored pick something off the
list you know you could do at that time
or maybe you need to plan to do it and
come to it okay guys that is it for our
relationship hacks we hope you enjoyed
