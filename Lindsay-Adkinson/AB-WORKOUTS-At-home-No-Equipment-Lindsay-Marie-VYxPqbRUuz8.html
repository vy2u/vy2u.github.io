today I'm doing a toe tap workout
routine now this is gonna be five or six
workouts or five or six different
exercises that anyone can do from
beginner to like expert mode this is not
a video game but like beginner to
advanced that anyone can do it's just
going to depend on how many you do based
on your body type your how in shape you
are how fit you are it's gonna duct
gonna depend on you I recommend starting
out if you're like a beginner I would
recommend maybe doing 25 of each and
then I should get more advanced as you
keep doing more and more I should feel
better then do as many as you want to do
that's up to you but I would say
starting out I would do about maybe 25
of each so without further ado let's go
ahead and get into the video I start out
with a plank I like to hold mine for
about a couple of minutes but every
thirty seconds I take a break and do
some knee touches which is also a good
exercise for your thighs but it also
kind of breaks up your plank so that
you're not holding it for too long and
stressing yourself out too much planks
are great for building deep inner core
muscles they're also really good at
reducing back pain and they also help
improve your posture and your balance
touching I like to move on to heel
touches this is great for working out
your obliques as well as some more core
strength first like to work out on one
heel at a time and then after that I
like to go back and do a set of
alternates
I love heel touches they feel really
good it really makes you feel like it's
getting a serious workout and then I
like to stop and take a dancing break
who doesn't do that in between and then
want someone walked in and I was done
moving on to leg raises you just simply
bring your legs up all the way to the
air and then almost bring them down to
the floor but stopping just before you
reach the floor and bringing them back
up this is great for your lower abdomen
as well as your hip flexors and this
actually feels pretty good next we're
moving on to flutter kicks for these
make sure you leave your hands flat on
the floor and your back as straight as
possible if not you're not gonna really
get the full benefit of it basically you
just kick your legs back and forth as
well just like the leg raises you don't
ever want to bring your legs completely
to the mat
and last but totally not least IND it
with some nice cross crunches this is
really going to work your entire abdomen
section you're just going to bring one
elbow to the opposite knee and you just
do this back and forth I like to do two
sets at a time and then switch to the
other knee and this is really really
gonna work out your entire abdomen
region alright guys so that was my toned
out workout routine that's just five or
six easy things anyone can do to get a
nice toned AB abdomen abs six whatever
you want to call it
make sure when you're done to stretch
drink plenty of water and then rest
because you always want to rest after a
workout I hope you guys enjoyed this
