for welcome to fear news today we were
doing a huge collab so Laura had this
great idea sorts of tests out amber
Scholl DIY when she told me I was like
that's such a good idea
I'm like a pretty too gamer Scholl fan
actually met her once an event I like
stand out was so nursing we both felt
like her DIYs are pretty like what
people want to do that I think you want
to make them definitely make sure after
to check out Laura's channel what kind
of videos you make good news also make
fashion videos on my fashions travel so
you know you want to watch them so go
check them out of our Instagram is so
cool you don't little popular links down
below make sure give this a thumbs up
and it's going get started okay so for
this first DIY that were testing I'm
doing it kind of two so I ever had two
rows he had the two a DIY robe should
one don't like the angel main one for
towards your fashion shows and she has a
sugar daddy robe that she just sold on
the successor boa around me but I can't
sew so chickens are don't be awesome
and what I didn't know what I wanted to
do is I thought why not combine them
into both I mean why not and this would
be a super extra row but not okay as
zones really easy once you do it once to
be like a look you literally just
Express the neon then just go out like
what we did with silver right or I'm
yeah it's really just so for this of all
I got was just like a plain black I
wanted to just animals when I have
Victoria Secret that I've had forever
and then
deeper so hard to find these are the
rhinestone letters I ended up to find
with Michaels we were hard to find that
I went to so many urban floors and I
probably found them they're like 2 bucks
so these are really cheap the feather
ball is like 3 bucks I got a ton of it
because I wasn't sure how much I would
need and then I got the crystals now I
would recommend amber and hers got hers
off of Amazon and hers were just like
sticker 1 there was like a an iron on
but I couldn't find an iron on one in a
store anyway have time to buy it from
Amazon so I got like some serious
crystal wings so hopefully you're going
to be pins I feel like we always had a
heavy so they're getting heavy much so
we'll see if they fit well be weights
going on alright so you just take the
end and sometimes you have to look at to
make it go through
and then you just have to try and poke
it through this little thing right here
there's actually a hole in a little hole
okay yeah so you just like poke it
through
okay so then once you have it through
like that you just like pull it
basically because we're going to need a
lot of this basically just so it true
like that and pull it and then she just
kept doing like that yeah yeah and she
said she did it pretty like yeah far
apart yeah it looks pretty good the only
problem I know that's gonna I feel like
the far apart they don't really like
it's not gonna secure that well if you
might want to almost do it I quote it's
a little closer okay basically we just
sold the entire feather boa around the
trim of the robe I ended up meeting two
of the Boas I bought for Michael's I
think in told I use about nine feet of a
feather boa but super simple to sew it
down and it's lasted extremely well and
then on the back we just glued on the
letters the LME M I didn't do my entire
name just because I thought it would
look look - like four are spaced out I
don't know but I'd load them down with a
six thousand glue and then I also glued
down the wings that I got and also just
to make sure they were extra secure I
also took some thread again and I sewed
the edges of the wings down as well just
to make sure it's like super super
secure overall I actually really love
this I love rings around I feel super
glam when I wear this all that was very
doable I definitely take some time it's
impatient but I thought it was really
fun I think it's really cute I do wish I
had sewn on and I glued on the LM and
the wings a little higher up but that's
obviously just my fault and just like a
personal preference but overall give
this one a big like any plus and I
thought it was really fun I wear it all
the time
oh we're trying out the marble table
countertop thing so I found this at
Lowe's and I actually had to ask for ice
for a wallpaper at first and I found out
no you actually asked for contact paper
and that made it a lot easier to find
it's a heads up but we just bought a
rolled it was super inexpensive and I
basically just rolled it out over my
table to measure it please excuse how
gross our dishwasher looks oh my gosh
that's embarrassing Tim you don't see it
but we just cut it into like the correct
size with a little bit of room left over
and literally just peel off the backing
and stick it on to the table looks so
simple I did not I didn't think it's
gonna be the symbol but it really was
then you just smooth out all the bubbles
and it's so that's like pretty much it I
do think the next time I might just be a
little bit more precise I might have
been a little too messy with it but
honestly we've already gotten so many
compliments who had family over and
friends over and everyone is like whoa
they were to buy that out and I'm like
no we made this ourselves
amber told E I watch you know so I'm
pretty impressed I definitely am glad we
did this I think it's really cute and I
also give this one a huge a fly thank
