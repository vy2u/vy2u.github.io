video is a back-to-school vide yo no
space video is a another back to school
video and this is a what's in my
backpack video and it also includes a
giveaway so make sure you watch the
entire video excite will talk about the
giveaway stuff in the end and without
further ado let me go ahead and show you
what is in my bookbag the first thing in
here is a binder and of course it is
silver and sparkly because I like to
feel like a princess if at all possible
so a silver sparkly binder is
appropriate I think correct I think so
next is this colorful paper I don't
really know what this is for but I know
it's like lying notebook paper but it's
colorful I don't know of any teachers
whatever really let you use this I had
pretty strict teacher especially in high
school so I don't know if I'd be allowed
to use it but it's colorful and I like
colorful stuff so that's why next is
this fire or like a what are these
called accordion files this was really
one dollar so I was like a must-have so
cute but I keep a lot of random things I
need like just random notes and stuff so
if i have like index cards all over the
place or random post it notes i wrote on
post-it notes a lot more of like a
teacher write something down and hands
it to me i'll lose it unless I put it in
something so I like these little
accordion file things because you can
just put like random papers in there and
obviously you have to have a non
colorful paper besides my you know neon
paper because they're not probably not
going to accept that so I just have this
really pretty notebook this is a UV
notebook just got it from target I love
chevron French so and I love this color
if you haven't seen my apartment tour
you should go watch it but this color
that's a darker teal color is actually
the color of my wall on my living room
because I love this color so much so
yeah I love this notebook because well
it's so cute and it's so colorful and
last but not least in the big top pocket
there are two boulders both of these are
also UV folders these are like the
cutest brain it's like I don't know if
it's like new but I've been seeing it
target this year super colorful like a
neon yellow eat green one and a really
pretty purple because as you can see
here umm I don't slack in the code
apartment with my school supplies so
gotta keep it funky and fresh
um so that is the empty bag a pocket now
when you zip up the big pocket so i can
show you the rest of it so then we have
this second pocket right here okay this
just have has a bunch of randoms in it i
will just go through it as well so first
index cards because studying and whatnot
and yeah so i need to study so i need
index cards and that's how i roll and i
am the one who gives a lot of bad like
sinus problems in school and I'm always
the one who's sniffling so Kleenex on
deck on flake on hand what would that be
I don't know I'm not very good with
these slang terms but I got it in you
come to my pencil case or my pencil
holder or my like schools what is this
car thing is called pencil holder but it
holds a lot more than pencils so let me
show you what this little guy holds okay
first things first paper clips because
um like handing in papers and stuff I
don't like to just hand a teacher like
six finger paper I don't have a stapler
and I guess teacher should have safe
place but just in case taper clips for
putting paper together and i also have
pencils because why wouldn't you have
pencils if you're going to school in
your backpack obviously I have pencils
um these are so cute you see these
pimples there's so freaking cute though
it's the glow sticks because who wants
to use boring um school glue and you can
use pink funky glue sticks on your own
and obviously you have to have
highlighters I think I mean I need them
in school I highlight my notes a lot I
like to make my notes as pretty as
possible because then if maybe I'll
actually pay attention in class and
actually read them if I just write them
all down that I will probably never look
at them again and I probably won't
really take notes but I'm getting to
highlight things that I'm most likely
gonna pay attention so you have to have
a pencil sharpener even though I just
realized that a pencil sharpener but I
don't have any wooden pencils Aspen at
least lots of many erasers
good even if you don't have a wooden
pencil you so eraser tips are so tiny
like you even see that focus on this
focus on the pencils whatever these
little erasers are not enough so I have
to have all of these little you know
extra ones for my last little pocket
here I have some hand lotion because we
all need hand lotion when hands get so
dry at school um hand sanitizer because
people are gross and you don't want to
touch hands with someone who's gross now
thank you for gross but if someone you
don't know what germs people have so
can't say tensor is necessary and
chapstick so an EOS lip balm obviously
because you need this in your life
because it's an EOS lip balm and your
lips get chapped right in the very last
thing that I think everyone has at
school if you don't then you should
because this is how you make friends
it's how you let's just go okay the last
thing I have my book bag is gone because
if you're not gonna make me friends and
you want to make friends poo water pack
of gum and the whole entire school is
going to flock to you and then you just
like well you want a piece of gum be my
friend what now that is everything that
is in my book bag and now here comes the
fun part this is actually a giveaway I
am no longer in school I just recently
graduated so therefore I need none of
this stuff meaning one of you guys is
