I'm doing a summer fitness motivation
video now this is just going to be two
things that I like to do to keep myself
motivated and keeping myself in shape
and fit and all that good stuff now I
know how hard it is to get motivated to
get off the couch and go work out I
really do I know how hard it is to pick
a healthy snack over a snack you really
want to eat trust me I have been there I
have failed many times and I finally
gotten to the point in my life where I
think I'm doing really good now the
first thing I'm going to be talking
about in this video is a yoga a lot of
people don't realize how good Yoga is
for you it detox is your body it clears
your mind it helps you become balanced
flexible toned and shame Yoga requires
no equipment you don't have to go to a
gym you can pretty much do this in the
living room of your own home in your PJs
if you want I'm gonna start by bringing
my hands up to the sky into Mountain
Pose who stretch my back then I'll bring
my hands back down to Center and then
slowly move into a chair pose which is
sort of like a lower squat then moving
my hands down to the floor for a forward
bend
next I'm going to move my hands forward
and walk into a lower plank hold this
for about 30 to 45 seconds then I'll
come up off my forearms onto my hands
and then I will move myself into my
first upward dog to stretch my back from
up dog I'm going to move my butt
straight into the air into my first
downward dog next I'm going to take my
first leg and lift it straight up into
the ceiling all the way to the sky as
tall as I can and I'm going to swing
that leg slowly in between my hands from
there I'm gonna bring my hands up
towards the sky and I'm now doing my a
crescent moon I'm then gonna come off
the ground and bring out my back leg and
stretch my arms out into my warrior two
of pose
I'm going back into downward dog pose
and then I'm going to walk my feet
forward and slowly roll up off of my mat
bringing my hands up slowly and then I'm
going to go out into my warrior three
pose by sticking one leg out behind me
and bringing my arms straight in front
of me so onto the snack portion of this
video I recently found a one brand that
I am obsessed with when it comes to like
healthy snacking now this brain is
called back to nature and I found mine
at Whole Foods I know they also have a
website so I will link the website down
below but you can also I think it's at
Whole Foods I got him in my Whole Foods
now my favorite thing about this brand
is they don't have any artificial
ingredients no artificial preservatives
no artificial flavoring they have no
high fructose corn syrup you can get a
lot of organic and gluten-free options
they have really good options and
choices and I let me just tell you I've
been eating everything from this brand
when it comes to snack wise so here are
my top five favorite snacks from back to
nature now I first number one Bay back
to nature or definitely the Chocolate
Chunk cookies I find myself reaching for
these like all the time probably too
much but hey at least I'm least a
guilt-free right so these are made from
wheat flour and rain forest Alliance
certified semi-sweet chocolate so it is
all natural stuff no artificial
ingredients these are delicious ten
times better than any Chips Ahoy cookies
you're ever gonna eat in your entire
life
I definitely think if you like chocolate
chip cookies which I'm sure you do who
doesn't then you should try these now my
second favorite are these spinach and
roasted garlic crackers these are so
good it even tells you it's made with
real vegetables so okay there get your
servings I really like to eat these with
Swiss cheese hummus
spinach dip I like to eat them with
cheese dip like pimento cheese dip these
are pretty much go butts anything these
are a great dipping cracker but they're
also really good by themselves because
of the roasted garlic and the spinach so
they have a lot of flavor
these are mmm my third favorite is
because I am definitely a Girl Scout
cookie lover these are the fudge man
cookies and these say they're made with
a crisp chocolate flavored cookie baked
with a hint of peppermint oil covered in
smooth rich fudge and sweetened with
cane juice so no artificial ingredients
and sugars no nasty stuff just natural
real good yumminess and these are to die
for
in my last but definitely not least
favorite from a back to nature are the
stone ground wheat crackers oh my gosh
so these are made with organic stone
ground wheat flour safflower oil whole
ground flaxseed and sea salt these are
also organic just so you know they do
have a lot of organic whole-grain and
gluten-free options anyways these are so
good these are probably my um like these
are like my alternative to Ritz crackers
I tend to eat these with everything
again these are really good with pimento
cheese dip I love Meadow cheese dip so
these definitely come in handy if you
just only like some plain cracker just
to dip things in if you're someone who
likes chip dip or cracker dip you need
some kind of a cracker to go with
everything and these are your go-to
crackers
these are super good so those are my top
5 things to get from back to nature I
definitely recommend this brand of snack
that's really good to find one good
brand that you know you can trust and
really go to and you're looking for a
good snack now I hope you guys enjoyed
