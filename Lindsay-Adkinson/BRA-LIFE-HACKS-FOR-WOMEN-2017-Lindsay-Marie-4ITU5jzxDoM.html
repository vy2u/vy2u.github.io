or welcome if you are new today's video
is a bra has or boob acts for girls
because you guys have been requesting
this is so so much honestly first a
little nervous is it to do this because
I thought there'd be a lot of creepers
and stuff but I just love it honestly
97% of my audiences female so I was like
okay why not
now also don't forget to enter it this
month to give away the prize is going to
be the Jackson Hills morphe palette all
you have to do to enter is want to be
subscribed to my channel in to follow me
on Instagram so I will put all the
details linked down below and yes check
that out now number one is the most
simple of all the hats and that is to
make sure you fitted for your bra this
one might seem very simple and
common-sense but I feel like a lot of
people don't know how do you fitted for
a bra so all you have to do is go into
like Victoria's Secret or somewhere
where you can buy a bra you don't even
have to buy a bra just go through one of
the sales ladies as I was going into
Victoria's Secret I feel a little bit
like because I just like I've always
just gone to Victoria Secret to do it
but you just simply go up to one of the
sales associate is usually they will
come in when you come in the store and
ask if you need me thing and just tell
them that you're shopping for a bra but
you don't actually know what your sizes
they will take you to the back they will
tell you a size your bras and then
you're free to go you don't even have to
purchase a bra to do that number two is
if you have any of those bra less or way
too thin and kind of like what's even
the point cuz it doesn't do anything but
you still want to wear it because it's
really cute
what you can do is take the padding out
of it old swimsuit that you don't want
anymore and to stick that in to the
bralette and wall up and voila it is no
longer super thin and it gives a lot
more coverage and padding if for some
reason you plan to wear something
strapless but you forgot to get a
strapless bra and you really don't know
where pasties are not wear bra what you
can do is one use a strapless bikini or
two will just take your regular bra and
take the straps off and just tuck them
in or even you could use a bobby pin to
pin your straps down and that way it
seems like you have a strapless bra and
you didn't have to go out and buy one if
you're going on vacation or something
and you don't have too much room to pass
what you can do is use some of your cute
swimsuit as bra less or even bra that
way you can save room in your suitcase
and just pack one thing and it kind of
works for everything I've been wanting
to go braless if you want your boobs
kind of held in place try wearing a
super tight fitted shirt that has a lot
of pattern on it because the tightening
part is going to keep your boobs in
place but these pattern is going to make
it where there's just too much going on
and the one's really going to be able to
tell that your mixers out or like your
boobs are out and they're not wearing a
bra a lot easier to hide now if you're
someone who'd like to go braless a lot
what I recommend doing besides just
getting a bralette is also getting these
small pieces or the petals which is what
you do with those you simply just stick
them right on your nipple it doesn't
cover your whole boob and then you can
wear like pretty much any shirt without
a bra and no one wanted to see your nips
and those are kind of like lifesavers to
me another thing if you do wear pasties
already and you find they're not
sticking what I like to do is when I
take that first off I keep the package
that it comes in the little plastic
container and whenever I take them off I
will rinse them under some cool water
and then stick them back on to the
package and when I put them on next time
they seem to be completely sticky again
and that makes them last like for a long
time I've literally had the same case
due to like two years and they still
stick completely like the same and I
wear this all the time okay so if you've
ever wear like white shirts and you
notice that you can see your bra through
them or like a white drive or something
it's also works for your underwear and
you don't want people to see your bra
through it but you also don't want to
wear a slip or like a tank upper limb
say Oh pick up sorry what you can do is
wear a skin colored bra or panties it
works for both because what happens is
when you're wearing a white see-through
type shirt and then like a white bra
you're see the contrast between your
skin it makes the bra more visible and
makes your skin more visible but I
learned that if you wear a bra that
matches your skin tone under the white
top it is less likely to be noticeable
and it's just going to look like a plain
white shirt and it won't look
see-through and you won't see you bro
this has actually saved me so many times
honestly all right Harrison those are
some of my favorite bra and boot hacks
tips and tricks and all that good stuff
I hope you guys enjoyed it please make
