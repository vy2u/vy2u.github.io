getting our plus in shape and literally
I need our butts bikini season is riding
around the ride around the corner and
who doesn't want a cute bikini booty I
know I do so I thought what better way
than all of us doing it together oh this
is going to be a workout slash challenge
where I am going to challenge you and
myself to come back and do the same
workout every day for 30 days well not
every day but we're gonna do three days
take a break three days take a break
three days take a break for a full month
so mark your calendars starting today
don't wait any longer start right now
today when you're watching this video
and we're gonna start doing this bikini
butt workout starting today for the next
month now we're gonna start off with
some simple hip flip you just don't want
to do 20 of these if you want to do more
go ahead but I think Coney is a really
good number make sure you're really
activating your butt muscles and you're
really using your glutes to really lift
your hips up there and try not to use
too much of other muscles around your
body really focus on using your butt and
all that region now I'd say do around 20
of these and once you've done about 20
hip lifts let's start by lifting one leg
off the ground I like to start with my
right leg just simply lift off the
ground wherever comfortable and keep
doing 20 more hip lifts on each side
with each leg and just keep that foot up
in the air that is adds a little bit
more resistance so that you are just
pushing a little bit harder
next we'll be moving on to knee lunges
they're pretty much going to do it in
lines except you're not going to be
walking forward you're just going to dip
your knee down tap the ground or go
right above it and do this 20 times on
for each knee like we did for the past
one I think 20 is a great number and
don't worry if you're starting to feel
it of course I feel it oh I'm pretty
sure I was so sore at this time I just
got out of bar class but don't worry you
can do it now for the last thing just
lie on all fours and simply simply kick
your foot up in the air tap your knee
back down on the ground and keep doing
that 20 on each leg you've got this
now for the last part of this video
we're going to be doing squats now
everyone knows squat to work squats are
what everyone does they want a nice butt
now this is gonna be a little different
than the rest of the workout because
what you're gonna want to do is pick a
number
I say 25 or 50 are really good starting
out numbers and every single time you
come back to this video add 5 more
squats so if this is your first time
watching this video so you do 25 squats
come back tomorrow and do 30 come back
to the next day and do 35 take a break
come back the next day do 40 45 50 take
a break now just to explain a little bit
more you can always do regular squats if
you'd like to do regular squats I
personally like to do plie squats which
is where you keep your legs wider apart
instead of in a chair tabletop because I
feel like this tone should legs a little
bit more than a normal squat so I like
to keep my legs far apart and squat down
which really really activates your butt
muscles and this is probably probably
one of the best workouts you can do to
really help a tone and tie in your butt
thank you guys so much for watching make
sure you bookmark this video save it for
later so you can come back and watch
