haul video and this is going to be a
clothing haul only it's pretty much only
clothes and a few pairs of shoes it is
back-to-school season or almost
back-to-school season for some of you
let me have a why all the lucky ones now
just because of the items I bought
aren't school appropriate for you
doesn't mean they aren't school program
for other people just remember that when
I say aspect to school haul it means it
back to school sales back to school
shopping time stuff like that I'm 22
years old in college dress codes are way
different than high school dress codes
and so yeah
first I got some stuff from lookbook
story now this is a wholesale site but
when it comes to wholesale sites it's
one of the hole so sites that I like a
lot this stuff is really inexpensive
like all whole sub sites but this stuff
is a really good quality still first I
got this really cute gray tank top it's
got a huge split down the middle I think
this would be really really really cute
like a black bra let and I also got this
really gorgeous necklace I think this
would look pretty with that tank top I
just think this is like absolutely
stunning it's like a coin necklace and
it's super heavy but girl I'm gonna wear
it I also got this pink crochet crop top
this is seriously adorable just like a
baby pink and then it's got a crochet
little pattern got this really cute top
I absolutely love like the design in the
middle and then I really love the
sleeves I love all kind of cutout sleeve
so this will be really cute with like
some denim that set from there which is
like a pair of shorts but also like a
sure they like goes together so the
shorts look like this they're so cute
I have to love the crochet and then it
also came with this same top which is
like it goes off of the shoulders but
then it has the bells sleeves to come
with the exact same like pattern as the
shorts this is so cute together I'm
gonna be wearing in a video soon it
might already be up if it is I linked it
such a cute outfit that's what this I'm
shopping at forever 21 twice
so bricks I bought a lot of stuff online
and then I later on went back to the
summer and got more
so I'm just gonna show you everything
that I got from burning one got two
pairs of shorts because I really needed
some new shorts it's so hot out and all
of my shorts seem to be like destroyed
dinner I needed something that we're
like high-waisted it's like Q butts
still not destroyed if that makes sense
so first I got these that don't have a
go button or anything in the front but
they have a zipper on the side and this
these are so high-waisted but they're
not too short like if you see them on
they're really not that short they're
really cute really simple got the second
pair of these aren't as high-waisted but
they're still really cute and they're
darker and yeah I've seen a bunch of
short so I went ahead and got two pair I
got two of these sweater crop tops I got
this white one right here and then I
also got the one that I'm wearing as you
can tell they're the exact same shirt so
I got one in white and then also in this
like reddish corley color these are just
super cute the pair was like honestly
anything I just feel like I always need
crop tops there always needs like simple
basic tank tops and these just kind of
go with everything I love like the high
neckline
I was recently watching a video I was
talking about how if you ever see a
piece you really want to wear but you're
nervous I need you just go for it so I
went for it I don't know really what
I'll wear this with if you have any
ideas let me know because I mean they're
super cute I just don't know like how
I'm gonna pay them or how they're gonna
look on me I have actually tried this on
yet but there are some really cute on
like a model online and I just wanted to
get them and they're on sale also got
this shirt which is honestly not really
my style but sometimes we go to nights
of dinners we go nicer places and I need
like nicer tops and so I still got it
anyways I mean it's still really cute I
really like the color and I also like
the like tassels on the front
I just wanted don't wear a lot of stuff
like this but it'll be nice for nicer
nights out then I also got this cropped
tank top right here it's just why would
they believe the floral type pattern
it's got like a little second layer on
the front as well really cute super
simple cute then I'm shorts or with
anything or whatever you want to wear I
also got this really cute black top so
it's got these straps right here but it
also has like this lace detail that goes
all the way around the front and also
like hangs onto your shoulder so it
hangs right around here
super cute so nice looking on I think
it's
cute I've said cute a million times but
I mean it's it's cute this top is super
cute that I got it's really simple it's
just a crop top but it's also got like
cutout sleeves on the side really simple
and not something I would wear like
anywhere fancy obviously but it's cute
it's like some black jeans or just like
something simple I also got this white
distressed racerback type tank top it's
got a little bitty main hole it's all
through it but they're on purpose
obviously this is super cute it's nice
when you want to look good more ntx top
I absolutely love it's a really nice
peachy tank top and then at the bottom
it's got some black lace that is
see-through it's so freakin cute this is
nice for like a date night or something
but I just think this is so cute on and
I had to get this one also got this at
yellow tank top I actually wore this in
a recent video super cute really simple
I've been trying to buy a lot more like
simple basic tops just because it's
summertime and I don't know I just find
a lot of funky stuff all the time and I
need to stop doing that I mean it's good
to buy those things but you don't want
everything in your closet being crazy
patterns last I got this really cute
blue tank top this is so soft like oh my
goodness I wore this yep it has really
really big cutoff sleeves on the side I
was pretty long everywhere there's like
leggings or something and maybe even
like to work out in by who knows I also
got two new pairs of shoes from fabric
fabric is my favorite place to get shoes
hands out the first pair look like this
they're so cute like nude pinky wedges
they have a really cute like cutout
design at the front and they also have
the laces up the front as well
super cute these are so nice they're
actually kind of hard to walk in to be
honest I don't know what it is about
these but they're just not very
comfortable I think it's like the bottom
is so flat to the ground then when foot
2 starts over it a little bit but
they're so cute they're worth it the
next pair of these so freakin adorable
black wedges I actually wear these all
the time these are actually pretty
comfortable I think it's because they're
so padded that my foot just feels fine I
really love it really thick straps I
don't know why but these just make me
feel like on top of the road when I wear
these I wear these all the time and
they're cute and if you want these I'll
link them down below because they're
mean they make you feel fabulous and you
all need everyone needs a pair of shoes
that makes them feel fabulous I also
went to the store sage that is like a
local boutique I actually got one thing
from there
this really cute romper I actually
thought this was a dress in the store
but then I realize it does have shorts
at the bottom you just can't really tell
it's really flowy and it's a really
really cute pattern it's great black and
white it's got like an ombre kind of
splatter looking pattern to it I also
got a new pair of tennis shoes because I
just need a pair and these were so cute
do you see these so for some reason on
camera they've been showing up as blue I
don't know I'm not looking at the camera
right now hopefully these don't come off
as blue because they aren't purple but
they have the light blue a teal and like
purple and pink designs all over it so
