hey guys welcome back to my channel
today we are doing a back to school
hairstyles because you guys have
requested this so I'm gonna do it um all
of us know how much of a struggle is
getting up in the morning and trying to
figure out what you're doing to your
hair what takes the least amount of time
but what still looks cute and all that
good stuff so here are like my favorite
hairstyle I like to do for early
mornings i'm specifically back to school
or going to work or anything like that
it's kind of work for anything but it's
back-to-school season so it's provide to
school i love you guys so much i hope
you enjoyed this and let's go ahead and
get started this first hairstyle is
super easy all i'm doing is taking a
cute headband that I got from forever 21
and I'm putting this over the top of my
head I'm going to pull out my bangs and
then I'm just going to take the
remainder of my hair and pull it into a
ponytail in the back of my head and then
I'm just going to pull it into the size
sort of like a side ponytail but I
wanted to still start from the back and
that is it for the first hairstyle
second you're showing you like put your
hair into an elastic and then you want
to put a hole above the elastic and take
all of your hair and loop it through
this is going to make like a faux
fishtail and it takes a lot less time
with in a regular fishtail and then you
just want to do this exact same thing
all the way down the strain of your hair
adding a new elastic and then looping
the rest of your hair through do this
three or four times or as long as your
hair is and it's gonna be super cute
like an easy fishtail braid but a lot
less time
you got your tour
for this 30 our song you just want to
take the top section of your hair and
put it into two pieces and then you want
to literally double knot your hair so
I'm just going to tie into two nods like
you can see here and then I'm going to
pull this hair back just in two and add
it back into a ponytail and then I'm
going to secure all of my hair with an
elastic and that is it it's just a
really cute way of adding like a little
knob before your ponytail really simple
but also really fun what a sports
hairstyle want to take my head to beat
and put it around the top of my head and
then I was taking my front two sections
of my hair and I'm going to loop it
through really cute as like a little
headband to your hairstyle really
bohemian girly and really simple
this next one is super simple I'm doing
is taking the top section in my hair I'm
tasting it just a little bit to give it
some volume pulling it back and I'm
actually just going to loop it with an
elastic into a little bun and that is it
a cute way to get my hair out of my face
but also have it down and so girly and
fun and a little bit more put together I
just want to get my bangs out of my face
I just like to take the front two
sections on my hair and put them into a
quick messy braid and once I have it all
braided I'm going to pull it apart and
make it super messy so that way just
looks more boho and messy and like it's
messy on purpose and then I'm just going
to take these two braided strands after
I messed them up but I'm just going to
pin them in the back of my head this is
a good way to get all of my hair out of
my face it adds a little headband it's
really cute and it's also really easy to
do before you were out the door
for this next one I'm just taking my
hair putting into three sections and I'm
going to grade each individual section
at on its own so I have three different
braids and then I'm just going to take
all three of these braids and gather
them in the back of my head I'm going to
wrap them around into a big braided bun
this is such a fun way to have a classy
braided bun really find it really simple
and really easy and then I'm just going
to a bobby pin it down mine takes a ton
of bobby pins but it stays it's really
easy to get to stay and really secure
really cute and it's really fun and
different buddy knows how the story goes
but fabry for this next hairstyle I'm
taking the same three braids I'm going
to just pin them on the top of my head
like a headband you can also just do
this with one or two braids if you want
but I already had the three braids done
I just pinned all the end zone with
bobby pins and then I'm good to go super
easy to keep your hair to your face for
gym class and just super easy and fun
and girly
for this last hair so I'm just gonna put
my hair into a side ponytail and then
I'm gonna go down about two inches and
added another elastic and then I'm going
to pull that hair part and make it sort
of like a bubble and then I'm going to
go down two more inches or cute more
inches and i'm going to add another
elastic i'm gonna do the same thing
where wrap it around and then I pull the
hair out to make you kind of like a
bubble this is called a bubble braid or
a Jasmine braids really simple really
cute but also really fun this was one of
my favorites but it takes like two
minutes and that is it
