or welcome if you are new but today's
video is my bikini body routine but this
is not like how to get a bikini body
because top secret you already have a
bikini body you should know that your
body is perfect just how it is you are
already ready to put on bikini you can
already put one on right now and look
fine and perfect and beautiful because
you are ready you already are perfect as
you are
so this is not going to be a video on
how to change your body type to look
like this so that you feel better in
about swimsuit because no no no no this
is just going to be things I like to do
but I already have a bikini body just
like you do just to approve myself a
little bit and take care of myself
before I go to the pool or the beach or
put on a swimsuit because it was winter
season there's some things I need to
take care of like my super-hearing legs
these are just the things I do to feel
more confident and clean and comfortable
when I'm wearing a swimsuit number one
is to find a swimsuit or wear swimsuits
that make you feel good I do not wear
swim to because someone else tells me
that it fits my body shape I do not wear
a swimsuit because someone else likes it
on me
I wear a swimsuit that makes me feel
good about me if you look in the mirror
and you're wearing a swimsuit you're
like oh I feel okay in it you don't want
to wear it you want to put the one on
that makes you feel like oh my god this
is a swimsuit for me
number two is shaving obviously shaving
is optional if you do not like to shave
you not want to shave you do not have to
I personally do like to shave before
wring swimsuit in the summertime and
yeah I like to be pretty hair free I
personally feel like whenever I have
stubble or something and I go to the
pool I feel very self-conscious
especially bikini area stubble I just
feel like everyone notices and they
probably don't the pro not paying
attention but just to make me feel more
confident and comfortable I do like to
be appreciated and here free I believe
that life is all about balance and
eating the foods you want but also
eating the foods that your body needs I
like to have a good balance of
everything but I do like to make sure
I'm taking a little bit extra care of
myself when I'm going out in the
summertime like to try and eat a little
bit healthier
a few extra salads extra green smoothies
I also like to make sure I'm getting in
my vitamins I it is crazy that I
realized if you stop taking vitamins
you may not realize how it affects you
but then when you start taking them
again you will realize how much better
you feel you'll notice your skin is more
glowing you will notice that your nails
grow faster your hair grows faster you
will definitely notice a difference so I
actually like to get all of my vitamins
and health food products and things like
nutritional products at the Vitamin
Shoppe it's kind of like a one-stop shop
for everyone they have stuff for
everybody but it's actually in
partnership with them but I do love
going to the vitamin shop and getting
all of my nutritional needs I love that
all the people that work there like
health enthusiasts if you go to them and
tell them what you're looking for what
your fitness goals are what you're
looking to achieve they can tell you
which products are for you which
products are not for you they can also
they're very nice if you tell them what
your budget is your price range it will
take you exactly to the products that
work for you you can afford and are good
for you my favorite products from
vitamin shoppe are my orbit vitamins
these are great vitamins to take daily
this is the women's multi and fish oil
vitamins these are the coolest little
things ever it's like a little capsule
but it also has like little bubbles in
them so basically the point of these is
it's a time-release vitamin so it
releases little doses of your vitamin
all day long and you know I don't check
out of the vitamin shop without grabbing
a complete cookie
I love the birthday cake one this
literally just tastes like a birthday
cake cookie they also have other flavors
that are all delicious
these have 16 grams of protein and it
says like baked nutrition there's no egg
no dairy no soy non GMO they're vegan 10
grams of fiber these are basically like
a healthy cookie that tastes like it's
not healthy and how could you complain
about that definitely make sure to check
out the vitamin shop and yours to you
they also have an online website to do
all of your purchasing as well and they
do have a blog filled with recipes and
tips and stuff like that
I will have all their links down below x
is trying a face mask out but not on
your face most people don't realize you
can use face masks on other parts of
your skin I actually learned this from
Alexandra's girly talk I love her
channel now I use my masks that I know
work for my acne and stuff like that
on other problem areas of my body and it
is life-changing if you are looking to
get a little bit more in shape there's
nothing wrong with that however you want
to make sure your your goal is to be a
have a healthy body not a body like
someone else and not a body that looks a
certain way a healthy body is different
for everyone but if you are looking to
get a little bit healthier my favorite
things to do is cardio which is running
I love running especially when it's warm
outside go for a run outside or a jog or
even a walk
all of it counts one thing that I did
some people may think I am crazy for is
I actually cut out the majority of my
salt intake now if I go to a restaurant
obviously they already put salt on a lot
of things if I buy packaged food it
already has salt on it but that is the
only salt I consume I no longer use
table salt on anything no and I actually
do not even own salt in our house
anymore
and at first it was really weird because
you do if you are someone who likes
salty food you kind of want to put it on
everything I used to put salt on
everything growing up that's just
something my family did and I was used
to but I notice now that I cut it out it
was weird at first but now I don't even
think about it I don't even taste the
difference it but when you eliminate
salt you can eliminate a lot of bloating
now not everyone bloats but girl me when
I have a lot of salt I bloat so badly
it's actually kind of painful my stomach
would get really really full my face
would get really round and I have a lot
of salt so cutting it out just made it
so much easier for me to stay hydrated
and not bloated but you also like to
apply some self-tanner I get lots of
questions on how are you so taint all
your out girl it is not real I just put
on a little bit of self-tanner like once
a week once every week and a half now as
I get more of like a tan from being
outside in the summer I will stop
applying it but in the beginning of
spring and summer I do like to use it I
love the loving tan in the shade dark I
do also like to apply self-tanner in the
spring and summer just to give myself a
little bit of an extra glow I get
questions all the time but how I'm so
tan and am i girl that it's not real as
I do I like to apply a little bit of
self-tanner and my favorite is the
loving tan in the shade dark it is so
good I play about every week until I get
a natural tan in the summer time and
the last thing I like to do to get ready
to feel confident and beautiful in sexy
and my bikini is use some accessories I
like to accessorize my clothes except
for saying my plain white tee but I also
like to accessorize at my swimsuit I
like to use scarves or like big type
scarf things to wrap around my waist
kind of like a skirt or cute kimonos you
can also use cute hats cute sunglasses
cute flip-flops cute beach bags to carry
your stuff in there's so many fun ways
to accessorize your swimsuit just to
feel a little bit more confident and
cute if you want to especially getting
some photos while you're there why not I
