welcome with your new today's video is a
trial haul there's also crazy with the
texting out review video because I got a
bunch of sources from The Fool I see a
bunch of people trying their swimsuits
and buying them and I've seen them all
over Instagram and I thought I was
trying to get basically for the price of
one Victoria Secrets with secrets on
foods you can buy right ten some suits
on my website sells as well is that so
we can be true or whoa are these
incredible so I thought we would try
them out and we'll find out so for
instance is a high-waisted halter top
bikini the bottoms have a really cool
funky pattern I don't really love the
pattern I think it's really flattering
on and it has really cool straps on the
back as well this is just subsist an
interesting bikini and also has with
tons of straps for the top it has a push
up it looking under wires that way kind
of gives you some but don't gadot guess
you want that you know everyone likes
different types of bikinis now the good
thing about this one is it was really
good quality I didn't just draft
definitely are my colleagues they don't
feel like they're falling apart
it doesn't seem like it's going to rip
so I'd give it from an A+ and I think
it's so cute on now the next one is a
one-piece and this is literally one of
my favorites I actually already wore
this for a photo queue and I love this
is a lot if you just got a floral top
and in the connecting blue bottom I love
the column it opens it makes it a little
bit more like a showy the kind I mean
girl so show what you got if you want to
show it so it means I'm gonna show here
I think it's really cute I think it's
really fun I love the colors really
earthy tones and I know I thought this
was all jacket difficult to put on
because they have so many different
straps around it if I figure out what
goes where but once I got on it like was
totally worth it and definitely good
quality from through this is really
simple orange bikini I've actually been
wearing this away too much but it is
kind of dirty just because I've
literally been wearing it almost every
day of the pool just because of one of
those it's really perfect for laying out
because it's no I doesn't doesn't cover
up a lot honestly which is great for
laying out but it doesn't you know cover
up too much
yeah you go I'm saying I really do love
this one I think it's really cute I love
the neon orange and it's very so it's
very simple is very small kind of a
cheeky bottom which I like sometimes
sometimes I get a little nervous I do
like them this always also really is
qualities I get that it's a little dirty
because I've worn it so much but I
definitely think for the price like yeah
oh my gosh room is actually
currently burrowing himself into my
Victoria Secret duffel bag through what
are you doing what are you doing in here
this is remembe aquino right now are you
taking an arrow so this is a bed now how
about if you sure cute ha alright you
can have the madness okay okay go back
to the swimsuit next one is this square
cut out like mesh type something I love
this one I think it's really edgy I had
it was a little loose for me actually I
just realized I didn't tighten the strap
so that's probably defined not loose on
me probably seen tightness drops what is
that it's very edgy it doesn't happen to
a puffle or time about what's back is is
really convenient because sometimes is
buckled and like ties I get nervous like
what if it was fun times and there's a
pool and like all up on the top comes
off but this one has with no buckles no
ties flip it over head time this drop
and you're good to go so with no
accidents
you saw accident-prone in the bottom is
are also the same super cute I love this
one I was next one is my favorite but
it's kind of sad because it doesn't fit
me it's like too big and it doesn't if
you can't work everything in a size
small but this one said it came in in a
medium so I'm also not sure if like
maybe I ordered a medium my accident I
probably did I'm probably like I ordered
a medium by accident but it is so cute
however I had made it fit enough for a
photo shoot waiting for this it's been
tying it in the back a little you just
tied straps together to make it fit and
honestly I'm okay doing that because
it's so cute it's worth it because
honestly this one piece is like swimming
in a nice one is a really simple
swimsuit it's all blue like whiteout
lighting on the strap I love for sewing
I think it's really cute really simple
which I love I liked it as a halter top
as well it's also got some padding so it
gives you a little bit more of a push up
if you want that and it's really
flattering a tie in the back and then
buckles in the back as well and I
definitely like that one is incredible
quality this one feels like I'm being
made from like any sort is you're
typically buying some this one's it from
the next one who is so freaking cute
basically this is a bandeau top but also
has a little cups for your sleeves oh my
gosh is a super sailor esque
I wore the
virtue yesterday and I felt like a
sailor and it had the same like you know
black and white stripe bottom but the
top is literally to die for and it's
actually super incredible quality
it definitely stays up its got like it's
nice tight elastic bands I'm not afraid
is going to slip so great quality super
look interesting like different than
most women to think this is really cute
really stands out I love it oh no I love
you okay
and it actually took me a long time to
put it on I was a little confused but
it's I love it
and well oh my gosh I love everything so
this one has been really sought a
pattern this is a light grayish powder
with white I think the honestly I do
think this one was supposed to be black
and white but it's more like a faded
black but it's still really cool and it
has the black top with wraps around so
you have to like figure out how this
goes on but once you get it on just oh
okay I love it and it is one of my
favorites is this a simple white line I
love this one it's really simple but so
pretty odd in why I make you look so tan
I love the top and the love the little
cutouts on the front and it's just a
simple so if sivanna is a cheeky bottom
and the straps have little Kyle's as
well so it's like a little little skimpy
size but I love it it makes me feel
really tan I look really pale right now
but I think it's just the lightning
doesn't actually pretty tan not like
that they not want to like don't get
ahead of yourself Lindsay but I mean I'm
not in that tail Maikel Franco is one of
my favorites is a blues white a halter
top but it has like the lace up detail
all to the mill it ties the back and
also buckles since it's a halter and
then it's not really interesting in a
detailed pattern I really like the
pattern and the base for the bottom just
match the side pattern if you can't tell
like it's a little you know mixed masse
but it's like supposed to Miss Matthews
but it's still Matthews of that make
sense I was like too much out all over
the place
well I do like this in a lot is all my
favorites and I still an awful end up
wearing that one a lot and Alaska is one
of my favorites as well I feel like
they're all of my favorites you're
probably like Josh Lindsay like did you
have someone else will say no I can't
help it go so simple why swimsuit but I
have to mesh cutouts and I love the mesh
I really liked it and like I said white
makes you look really tan and then the
top is pretty much the same except for
it's like the white plain wipe the
covers up like your nips and stuff but
then just cut mesh along the sides
really fine I love the gold little bows
on it that sounds weird but it's really
cute make sure
pan in the photos and Anila rain yeah so
basically the the cupola conclusion as I
love all the swimsuits ugly I would give
it like a nine point five out of ten the
shipping was super fast it came like
like five different packages I ordered
so many like two per package that came
really fast super affordable
they look good they're pretty good
quality they last and they wash them so
far they look really good in photo shoot
so I thought was not for the fullest oh
