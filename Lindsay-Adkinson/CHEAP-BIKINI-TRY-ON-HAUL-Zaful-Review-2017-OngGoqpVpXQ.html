welcome to see our new my name is
lindsey marie and make sure you hit that
subscribe button because I upload new
videos every Thursday and Sunday
now if you don't know already I already
uploaded another a first the full bikini
try on haul and you guys really like it
however there's kind of like confliction
because a lot of you guys were confused
because know the bull did not sponsor me
in that video they did not pay from me
to make a video it was not required to
make a video but as I told you guys
yes the fool did send me the bikinis so
long do you guys like hey you know I
haven't had very good experiences listen
I would love for you to buy some suits
on your own and then tell us what you
think and I was like ok that's a good
idea
now also another thing to think about
before use this video if there was
another youtuber who did the full haul a
few years ago and in heard the full hole
she hated them she hated them but then
she made seconds of full whole years
later a few years later instead of the
video this is a recent video I just
watched it today that she heard as a
fool I completely changed their company
like they were altered by someone new
and they're shipping a change and their
quality had changes like a whole new
better company so she decided to try
them again I will link her video down
below she decided to try the pool again
and this time she said she loved this
piece of the shipping a lot faster the
quality was a lot better now I comes to
shipping my things came in three
packages which was kind of weird I
ordered twelve is I call swimsuits might
be fifteen what was 13 some suits the
first package I got within three or four
days it has to simplicity I was a little
confused but then about a week later I
got a second package with about ten
swimsuits in it
Oh most of my folks were in that package
I actually thought that was old my
bikini those ready to film but then like
two days ago
I got another package in the mail with
two more swimsuits so overall it took
about two weeks for all of my clothes to
arrive okay feel free so soon eggs it's
really pretty blue one now I love this
blue I just love this color I don't know
why this is B blue colors are my
favorite I think they look really cool
with my hair - maybe that's why I love
it now this one is actually a little big
on me because I don't know why this is a
size small yet it's a very small but it
was a little big but not
that's where I can't wear it it's just
the straps are not adjustable and
they're kind of long so they just paint
a little loose but I honestly think I'll
still wear this because it's so cute and
it's really good material it doesn't
feel like it's going to break I can
stretch it apart like nothing happens I
definitely feel like this is a good
quality material that's just like just
messily stripe swimsuit or bikini I love
this one the quality books so good if
you don't like Victoria Secret swimsuit
the padding is really nice and really
well done the strings are adjustable
which I love I love them they're
adjustable that was nice philosophy is
not my style but that's not as a fold
fault that's like my fault because I
picked it out I kind of knew that wasn't
my fault but I figured like one of you
guys it might be your style so why not
try it out anyways this is a really baby
pink and it has like ruffles or frilled
on the side of the bottom and also on
the cuff of the boot part but a just
really good material the straps feel
really good the stitching looks really
perfect nothing looks bad about all the
padding and underlining is really nice
quality now is next when you may or may
not have seen before because Laura DIY I
was been wearing this on her Instagram
know I don't know if she got it from the
pool but she does have the same swimsuit
now that's just a really pretty like
least pattern on the bottom and then it
has like a mismatch of peachy pink top I
love this long as it's almost a corally
pink especially is actually my favorite
is a really pretty pale blue so I'm
doing a hat is really pretty like a
floral design it's all really pale
neutral colors like my corals and tans
and grays and blues and the blue isn't
really mutual is that I don't know but I
love it okay I love this one
you got to be probably seen this on my
Instagram if you follow me is not you
should follow me I imporantly up in like
three or four photos because I love this
swimsuit
now this next one's a little weird
because if you watched my first as a
pool hall
you know I ordered one I got one item in
the wrong size and I thought maybe it
was my fault now I'm actually not sure
because I did order this swimsuit in the
small I checked and I got this one in a
medium but actually it doesn't really
matter too much because the straps are
adjustable and this is super stretchy so
it does actually still fit however my
only problem with that is like
I would rather a company like reach out
to me and tell me if they don't have my
size and just send me the next size
because what is this didn't fit you know
minute what have you my fault I'm gonna
have to handle like shipping it back all
that stuff this neckties are really
pretty like deep turquoise orchid Depot
kind of like a deep sea green a sea
green blue does that make sense but I
love it's really different and very very
very like low-cut low v-neck like it's
very open but it's like that one for a
bit so it's definitely is very like
let's show your chest the kind of look
so make sure you like that if you order
the phones but I really like I think
it's really pretty and very flattering I
love this color I love the tie rope
detailing on the straps and same on the
bikini bottom this one is cheeky but
it's not too cheeky which I like next
day just gorgeous like or me hunter
green one I love this color is so pretty
oh okay sorry but I love this line level
two straps on the top super strappy
super cute gorgeous color if you like
army green or like hunter green I do
kind and all the color I forgot that's
like the term now I didn't know what
color this is called talk about the
lace-up detailing on the bottom so it's
really pretty and matching also not
super cheeky which I like for this one
next one a be super neon yellow
highlighter top and the bottom is a
really pretty like bright floral pattern
with like yellows and purples and blues
in all different colors I do like this
one a lot I feel like highlighter colors
you can only really wear with like
swimsuits and workout clothes you know
I'm saying they just look kind of
bunched up in the middle like they're
not spaced out weather so I really think
it didn't space out the laces enough
when they sewed them so they're kind of
like they don't stand straight across
your chest they kind of all bunch up
when you're wearing them so I just think
maybe there's one so then for their part
I'm not sure you know ways and so where
there's nothing wrong with it it just
looks it looks slightly different on the
laces than offline
like I said slightly different not
because he was different so for the
price you're still getting a great some
food next is this gorgeous like tan
brown line I love this one I love this
color super gorgeous color I love this
this one is adjustable so hallelujah
adjustable straps because I look at
short shoulders maybe and then I also
have a super this is a cheekiest bottom
of all the bottoms that I have um but
you're like girl Rocco but nobody not
talk about my talking about Dell but
yeah I'm creeping I'm skating downward
but I think this we were cheeky but I
mean that's okay um girls just wanna
have fun that made no sense this next
one is a really cute like thicker top
and me like sicker as like this not like
string bikini and on Contras you call
these tops manali string ones but
they're really pretty tight I blue I do
love that think the color is stunning
it's also got like a thicker bottom
which I like to view I don't want to
always show all my goodies and them
outside
I think it's really pretty I think this
looks really flattering on I really
don't wear this a lot I like it a lot
principle is really good quality
definitely feels like an expensive some
who doesn't feel like something that's
cheap now this next one
let the hair in my mouth it was a pretty
burnt orange on this line I do have a
little bit of a problem it is made just
like that blue one however the cuffs on
my foot are like kind of messed up with
the padding is like here in here like I
don't know if you can tell the padding
is just kind of far apart doesn't really
the padding doesn't really cover up your
nips it kind of covers up the size of
your boob so I like to Pat me just a
little too far apart you know wait I do
still see myself wearing is I do love
the color I think it's really pretty
maybe I'll just wear this like when I'm
going to the hot tub or something like
that just so like it for some reason
like you've got a little bit of like
nipple popping through that no one's
right I like talking that that's kind
weird
thanks I'm still gonna wear that there
is a little bit of like padding issue in
here but what can I say and last one of
these is the wrist case one of all and
this is this really cool like netted
title on a second net material so we
just feed it through on a proper date
sequin a rose pattern on the boobs and
it is really good quality with the
netting feels really good like you can
stretch on it and it's not ripping which
is good because you know this is
important not to rip when you're wearing
something like this and the straps go
really good and then I love the bottom
because they're just a simple black one
but with this really cute row orchid up
rose really cute with hard detail on the
side
like all end up wearing these bottles
with like all my other mismatching black
ones just goes it's so cute but this is
a little risky riskier I don't know how
I don't know how often I would wear this
out I kind of got just because I want to
see what it was like in person I maybe I
can wear like Kristin this is like Vegas
or something I don't know but if you
like a girl do your thing okay guys well
they're all my swimsuits overall I say
the pool is still really good quality my
opinion for the price I think you do get
really good swimsuits like I said a lot
of people have said their quality of
chains or shipping exchange their
company has changed maybe try them again
and let me know in the comment doctor
you shop with them in 2017 what you
think because I think it is interesting
how the other girl did say they've
changed their company so that makes me
wonder if maybe that's why some people
didn't like them before what people are
really liking them now that would make a
lot of sense make sure to hit that
