clean today and doesn't want me to put
her down but she's fluffy and soft so
that is ok so today I am doing a DIY
Mother's Day gift ideas Mother's Day is
in two days so these are all going to be
last-minute easy quick ideas but they're
also still meaningful and thoughtful so
hope this video helps you guys out for
this Mother's Mother's Day holiday and
without further ado let's get into the
video for this first DIY I was taking a
simple white playing coffee mug and I'm
pasting down an initial you can do your
mom's initial you can do a full name
whatever you want I just went for a
simple initial there's take a Sharpie
pen I'm just dotting all around with a
stencil you can do whatever kind of
pattern you want I tend to do like
tighter circles by the stencil to make
them a little bit scattered as you get
farther apart and then you should want
to take your stencil off when you're
done doing all your little polka dots
then you just want to bake your cup for
about 30 minutes in the oven I will have
a full list of instructions on how to
bake it down below then you can just
fill your mug up with candy or whatever
kind of treats you want for your mom and
you're good to go for the first DIY next
is an assorted gift basket the first
thing I did was take a container and
fill it with some nail polish you can do
whatever you want and then I took a
silver bucket and I filled it with candy
a loofah some bath products and then I
stuffed in my basket for my little
bucket filled with nail polish and I
also added in some lip gloss now you can
make this as personalized as you want
and you can also find really cute cheap
things at Family Dollar and so you don't
have to spend a ton of money on this and
the last thing is going to be for
someone who wants to buy something like
flowers for your mom or candy this is
just something you can add an extra like
a personalized card so what I did is I
added some stickers to write the word
mom and I wrote a cute little note on it
added some extra stickers and then on
the back I wrote a to-do list for
Mother's Day like going out to dinner
and getting facials eating cake and
stuff like that so you can suck that in
with your flowers and make it a little
bit more personalized
