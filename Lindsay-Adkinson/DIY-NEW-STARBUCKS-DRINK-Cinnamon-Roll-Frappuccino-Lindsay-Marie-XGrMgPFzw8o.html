doing a DIY cinnamon roll Frappuccino if
you didn't know like I said in
yesterday's video
Starbucks brought out six brand new
flavors they're called the fan flavors
which are basically secret menu items
that they brought onto their official
menu for a limited time now yesterday I
created the red velvet cake frappe and
today I'm doing these salmon roll frappe
and without further ado let's get into
the video now for your frappe you just
want to add coffee milk the more milk of
the less coffee taste is gonna have then
you wanna add ice the more ice you have
the thicker it's going to be next you
just want to add cinnamon toast Aesir up
in white mocha sauce the white mocha
sauce comes from the sundae section and
any kind of grocery store then you just
want to blend it up and pour it into
your cup flashes want to top it with
some yummy whipped cream if you like
whipped cream some cinnamon sugar and
you are ready to enjoy
