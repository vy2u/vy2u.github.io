to make sure they'll say I'm doing a DIY
room decor also this is a cloud with my
new friend Savannah her channel is
Savannah and stuff you'll love her video
she's also doing a dollar store DIY and
i'm pretty sure everything in her DIY
will be coming from the dollar store so
that's very inexpensive super cheap you
doesn't want to check it out so after
watching my video go check out her
channel i'll link it down below and all
that stuff so you definitely wanna go
watch it and without further ado let's
get into with the video this first year
is super easy I need our scissors so
washi tape or cute decorative tape and
then you also need some sort of pictures
these can be printed out from the
internet they give me magazine clippings
that can be pictures you've taken
yourself that you print it off with your
printer or a costco or something like
that any kind of photos at all now all
you want to do is take your tape and you
want to tape these down onto your wall
pretty good you know simple and
self-explanatory you can do all sorts of
designs you can do any kind of theme you
want it's such a cute and easy way to
really jazz up and decorate your room
without spending any money really at all
and it's super cute in very simple to do
yeah
for this next DIY all you're doing is
taking a wooden letter I found mine at
Michael's for like three dollars and
then I'm taking some flowers some fake
flowers that I got from the dollar store
I just cut off the stems and then
usually take some glue and glue down the
flowers onto your wooden letter and you
are done for this next DIY you will need
tissue paper string and scissors now you
will take one piece of tissue paper at a
time fold it hotdogs and hamburgers all
over and over until it comes to hot dog
style and these want to cut slits into
the open side of the tissue paper until
the top two inches then you want to
unfold the individual piece of tissue
paper and cut the one sheet into
different sections until you have three
or four separate sections depending on
how big your tissue paper is nice you
want to roll each individual section and
then glue the middle to secure it that
is going to create your tackle you won't
do the same thing over and over until
you have enough castle I think I had
about 12 or 15 then you just want to
take each individual tassel and hang
them on your string and then she's gonna
hang up your string and you are done and
you have a really cute like line of
tassels or pom pom hagan thing I don't
know what you call it this is super cute
to hang in your room or even hang it
over your bed and it's barely it's
pretty easy just takes a little bit of
time a little bit of practice
