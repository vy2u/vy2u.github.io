you are new if you didn't know Starbucks
just came out with six new flavors onto
their menu now these are called the fan
flavors so basically these are flavors
or drinks that we kind of already knew
about because they were sort of on the
secret menu but now they have brought
them out for a limited time on to their
actual official menu and today I'm gonna
be doing a DIY on the red velvet cake
frappe so without further ado let's go
ahead and get started
for my wrap I am starting out with ice
and milk you can use any kind of milk
coconut milk almond milk skim milk
whatever milk you have I'm just using 2%
and then I'm going in with raspberry
syrup
I love the torini brand because it's
inexpensive and very good next I'm just
adding chocolate chips and chocolate
sauce my chocolate sauce is Nesquik and
my chocolate chips are like Walmart
brand and then I'm going in with some
vanilla syrup this is also from the
Turanian brand and then I'm just going
to blend all this up in my nutribullet
PS I might be having a nutribullet
giveaway very soon so stay tuned for
that then I'm going to blend all this up
and it's going to become the perfect red
velvet cake frappin property no
consistency whatever it's delicious okay
next I'm just going to pour it into my
Starbucks cup and yes I made a mess I
literally just went into Starbucks and
asked them if they could let me borrow a
few cups and they were super nice about
it next I'm going to top it with whipped
cream and then I have the perfect red
velvet cake Frappuccino I hope you guys
enjoy it it was super super delicious
