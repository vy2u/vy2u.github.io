video from one of my favorite youtubers
called ten ways to be prettier and
honestly when I saw the title I assumed
it was going to be all about like inner
beauty and positivity and then I clicked
it I'm not gonna lie I was a little
letdown now I'm not putting down this
video in any way shape or form I'm not
putting the video down
actually that youtuber that made this is
one of my very very favorite youtubers I
think she is so beautiful inside and now
I think she's actually one of the most I
think she's one of the prettiest girls
I've ever seen and you can tell from
watching her videos that she has a
really good heart
now I'm assuming when she made this
video that she just wanted to show you
ways to enhance your beauty you know
through hair extensions and you know
fake eyelashes and like stuff like that
or like highlighter stuff like that I
can understand making a video all about
ways to enhance your beauty I understand
that but the title is ten ways to be
prettier so that she probably was
thinking like that's a clickbait title
people are gonna click that I can
understand that how and and I think a
lot of you a lot of people get lost in
the clickbait titles and like trying to
be catchy on YouTube I've done that
myself but the thing is there's so many
young minds out there watching videos
that people don't realize sometimes the
content they put out can really
physically and mentally hurt someone now
if you if you don't know much about my
past or much about me somebody I know a
lot of you guys do oops sorry
rude I actually was very very depressed
and I was younger and some of you guys
say don't see the press unless you've
been diagnosed I was diagnosed so
there's that before you go and leave
that comment I was diagnosed with
depression when I was younger I was very
depressed I was very insecure and
honestly still to this day I find myself
being very insecure we all have
insecurities and we all like to make
ourselves feel better and yes hair
extensions I have them I think eyelashes
I'm wearing them today highlighter oh
it's up it can make you feel so good
about yourself it can make you feel
confident yes but I want you to
understand that beauty is not on the
outside I'll give a flying Frick who you
are you are beautiful you are pretty you
are gorgeous you are stunning I could
literally cry thinking about that
because I think about myself as a young
girl
um if I'd watched that video I would
think that I need to go and do all those
things for myself to be pretty and I
don't want you thinking that no I also
don't think you shouldn't just I don't
think you should dislike that video at
all I think it has a lot of good tips to
enhance your beauty if you'd like to but
it's not going to make you prettier it's
not gonna make you pretty um it might
make you feel more confident yes but
it's not oh I just look so I'm actually
I'm just gonna share with you I know I'm
just sitting down a rambling honestly
I'm gonna share with you 10 ways that I
think that will make you prettier number
one smile because happy girls are the
prettiest get yourself in a good freakin
mood be happy just be happy are we Alex
Miley hope so if not I hope you smile
anyways number two is to spread kindness
everywhere you go
be kind to people kindness is pretty
being kind girl it's not even a girl and
I think sigh brother being kind is
pretty being kind is beautiful be kind
to everyone number three be kind to
yourself do not put yourself down
do not call yourself mean words do not
ever call yourself ugly do not ever call
yourself fat do not ever call yourself
any negative word because you are not
those negative words I'm really gonna
cry you are beautiful you are perfect
exactly how you are okay you might think
that that's weird that I'm saying that
with all these things on cuz yeah I am
John insecurities just like you do but
that's not this is not what makes me me
like this is not what makes me pretty at
all the next one is to be confident and
if for some reason getting hair
extensions and stuff makes you confident
then do it that's fine but do not rely
on those things to make you happy and to
make you feel prettier in life do not
rely on those things do just don't okay
think you have to spend money on
extensions and makeup to be pretty
because you don't but if for some reason
you think it makes you feel more
confident that is okay so I'm not
putting down a video at all I think her
video is all about how to make yourself
feel better but know that you should not
be relying on superficial items to make
yourself feel whole on the inside okay
please know that as I as a young girl I
relied on that stuff
it like broke me down as that you know
as a kid and like as a teenager and even
today sometimes like feeling like I had
to do all these things to be pretty and
like being afraid to go outside like
don't make a bond I'm feeling like it
just it broke me down and some people
are confident enough you know some
people are confident enough to watch
those videos and it doesn't do anything
to them but I know there are some girls
out there that will watch videos like
that and think that they are not good
enough and I don't want you thinking
that okay because you are the next one
she does mention something about um she
likes waking up in the morning and her
you know her boyfriend like are seeing
her Rd glam girl I understand that I get
that so much I've had a guy over and I
wake up and like oh gotta run to
the bathroom put on my concealer put on
my mascara clip in my hair lay back down
and so he wakes up and he's like oh now
that is okay I understand that I
completely get it but do not ever
surround yourself with people that make
you feel you have to do that now I'm not
saying she does because you can tell
from watching her video she has it she's
a goals boyfriend her boyfriend is goals
he literally brings her breakfast and
stuff he's goals but I'm just saying in
general do not think that you need a guy
that makes you feel like you have to
wake up and put on makeup okay but know
that in the long run you want someone
that thinks you are bomb as hell with
all of your makeup gone all the stuff
all the superficial things gone you want
someone who thinks you are just as sexy
like that okay I'm probably not gonna
have ten ways because that's that's
really it it's just to be happy be
confident smile love yourself love
others and you are already beautiful
okay that's literally it now like I said
I have a no way shape or form putting
out her video please don't think that I
would hate for someone to think I was
putting them down I think her video had
good intentions I think has great
intentions I just think with a title
being a you know like a clickbait I when
she admitted it was a clickbait title in
a snap I don't think I think sometimes
people forget that those clickbait
titles can really mess with someone who
has low self-esteem
you know um just like the how to get a
bikini body I think those videos have
good intentions but you can click it and
if you have low self-esteem you might
actually think that those things are
what you need to be a bikini body and
none of those things are true you are
perfect just how you are okay if you
want to put on makeup if you want to put
on extensions you go for a girl go
you do your thing I love makeup I love
hair extensions but do not ever think
that you need it okay because you
freakin dog okay I love you so much
whoever you are I love you so much
please be confident do not ever don't
ever just be happy okay Tammy and your
selfies I just spit on myself Georgia
little girl to spit on my face tag me in
your selfies if you want and I will tell
you how freakin hot you are hot might be
a weird word I'll tell you how beautiful
you are my girl you are how to I don't
care okay I don't care tag me in your
selfies on this room if you want it
doesn't matter I will let you know how
freakin bomb you are I love you guys

hope you understand it is meant to be
happy and positive and nothing negative

thumbs up if you liked it leave any
