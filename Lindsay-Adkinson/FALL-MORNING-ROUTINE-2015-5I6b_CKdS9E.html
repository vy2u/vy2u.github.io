night of dreaming of pizza and Austin
Butler it's time for me to wake up and
start my day I typically start off by
yawning a ton instructing in my bed and
of course loving on my dogs and after a
few minutes of that it is time for me to
finally get out of bed and once again
but I will immediately make my bed or at
least like halfway make it because if I
don't then we all know I am going right
back in there so that is not happening
so now it's time for me to head into the
living room and first thing this morning
I lit a candle this is my marshmallow
fireside because it smells delicious and
now it's time for me to make coffee
because first always is coffee I
actually really love instant coffee
don't judge me until you've tried it is
so good um I always use the dry like non
like the kind you don't put in the
fridge kind of creamer and then I use
the Terranea vanilla syrup I like my
coffee with a lot of creamer and just a
little bit of syrup and yeah so I also
obviously have to have my coffee to
start my date or I'm not gonna be in a
good mood
so once my coffee is made I will
typically take it over to my bar stool
in my kitchen and I will sit on my phone
for a little bit and drink my coffee
this gives me a little bit of time to
wake up and just feel a little bit more
of myself and then it's time for my
morning workout I like to use this app
called sworkit it's super helpful for me
basically you can choose what part of
your body and how long you want to
workout for anytime between like five to
sixty plus minutes they have things from
strength training yoga Pilates
stretching workouts and you don't need
any equipment which is great because I
don't have any equipment and they also
have really awesome video demonstrations
with like real personal trainers they
and it also has like verbal instructions
and cues so it's super helpful if you
need something like to boost you along
in your workout which really helps me
and you can also design custom workouts
and they also have pre-made work
workouts as well which are kind of like
my favorite and you can even connect it
to your Spotify so you can listen to
music on the way so what I like to do is
pick up my workout for the morning all
my sworkit app and then I would just
follow along on my phone and I'll just
do all the things it gives me like
little instructions this morning I did a
intermediate full body workout and then
afterwards I did a little bit of
stretching and I felt really really good
afterwards and I was just super vitalize
and I just felt like I got all of my
workout done a first thing in the more
so yeah smart get is super helpful if
you're trying to get in shape but it's
really helped me stay motivated so yeah
definitely check outs work in the app
and Android store of you are interested
snapped I'm done getting all sweaty from
my workout it's time for me to take my
shower in the morning basically I
already have a shower routine on my
channel make sure to check it out if you
haven't already seen that and I will
also brush my teeth while I'm in the
shower all that good stuff and then I
will get out and I will immediately
blow-dry my hair just because my hair
takes forever to dry so I'll go ahead
and get that out of the way and then
this time for you go back into the
bedroom to finish my hair and my makeup
first I'm just going in with my tinted
moisturizer from pure minerals and then
my concealer from benefit I'm just going
to blend all of this out
now I actually got a lot of new makeup
really recently that I really wanted to
try out I got a 12 piece and natural
hair brush set from Katy and then also
from Katy website I got a blush and
bronzer so I basically just used my
brushes that I got from Carrie and the
bronzer and I applied this two of these
yeah two of the contours of my cheek as
well as my temple and I really like that
the bronzer in this kit is super like
not like natural and nice and easy to
blend out and the brushes were also
really really nice as well and then I
just used the three of the blushes from
the set because they were all so pretty
so I couldn't decide and now it's time
for me to go in with my eyebrows and
then I'm also using these Smoke palette
is also from candy and I'm just going to
apply my eyeshadows this Lily has so
many gorgeous shadows I can't wait to
play around with this a little bit more
and I'm sure you'll see this and plenty
of my Halloween tutorial videos as well
so I'm just doing my eye shadow also
using the brushes from my carroty kit
and then going back and I'm doing
currently my lashes and going in with my
favorite mascara and to top it back off
I got this cute little personalized
lipstick from finding Ferdinand is that
what I think that's what it's called
and now it's time for me to do my hair I
was going in with a heat protector
obviously and then next I'm putting in
my bombay hair extensions I got these
really recently but literally they match
my hair so perfectly so I'm just going
to clip all of these in I think I clip
in like five left
they're super thick all the way from
like the top where the clips are all the
way down these are hands down the best
extensions I have ever used I will
honestly never go back to any other
brand and I was like just section off my
hair and I'm also using my new bomb
curling wands this is from the gold is
it like a gold collection but out either
way it's a little beautiful I just use
this and I wrap big sections around the
wand isn't the one beautiful with the
gold anyways and this just produces
really natural and nice curls you can
also make them like a lot tighter if you
hold it on a little bit longer but I
like having like loose natural curls I
think this is absolutely stunning and
the curls last me honestly like three
days don't tell anyone but it's the
truth
next it is time for some relaxation for
a little bit that is typically when I
drink my tiny tea from your tea this is
basically one of the most gentle teas to
help you detox I'm supposed to help you
with bloating digestion healthy weight
loss and energy I'm currently on the 28
day detox I've seen such a difference
I've lost a lot of stubborn ways that
I've had on my stomach area and on my
thighs and I've also been a lot more
energetic and I've had no bloating I
plan to do a before and after as soon as
I'm done with a 28 day detox from tiny
tea as well so make sure let me know if
you guys want to see that but yeah I
definitely recommend tiny tea if you're
looking for a good detox tea and then
once I'm done drinking that and spending
some time to myself and it's time for me
to bake make a breakfast typically I
will have a bigger breakfast but I was
going out to meet some friends for
brunch so I decided to just make a quick
smoothie and then sit down on the couch
and finish that while watching an
episode of scandal and after that it is
just that is it for my morning so hope
