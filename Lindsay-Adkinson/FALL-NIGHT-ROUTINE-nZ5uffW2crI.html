or welcome if you're new today's video
is my night routine so typically when I
first come in and always lock my door
and I go straight to my computer
depending on if I was out somewhere if I
was just already at home I always like
to do my emails and like typical
computer stuff first so today I'm just
writing some emails checking up on some
YouTube stuff replying to comments all
of the usual
and then before you know my stomach is
growling and I am hungry so it's time
for me to make some dinner now what I
like to do is meal prep just because I'm
a little busy at night so I'm eating one
of my meal prep just something I've
cooked at the beginning of the week just
so that I have stuff ready this is a
great idea if you're someone who is
always on the go I can make a video more
in depth about meal prepping if you'd
like me to just let me know in the
comments down below so once that is done
heating up but it's time for you to eat
it I'm so excited because I'm usually so
hungry but obviously here I am looking
my phone first so obviously I wasn't too
hungry
and now it's time to relax and unwind a
little bit and pretty much just let my
stomach settle so I'm just with sitting
down and checking my phone or watching a
little bit of TV sometimes I'll sit down
for an hour sometimes I'll sit down for
three hours it depends on my mood and
you know how tired I am we're just
probably a.m.
so I was just sitting down and I was up
checking my phone and watching Gossip
Girl this is like my fourth time we
watching the show and literally I am
still just as obsessed and depending on
what day of the week it is sometimes I
like to go out at nighttime and workout
so today I was just changing in for my
regular clothes into my workout clothes
putting on my shoes throwing my clothes
in the dirty hamper grabbing some
headphones and heading out the door to
go for a ride
so once I come back in all hot sweaty
and let's be serious a little smelly it
is time for me to do it to do anymore
pampering things I have to do it for the
night obviously there are different
things I do different nights but tonight
in particular I wanted to whiten my
teeth because Miley Miley did actually
send me a teeth whitening tray or teeth
whitening kit and I was pretty excited
so Bertha first I just took the two
trays and I molded them to fit my teeth
are you sticking in some hot water it's
super simple and easy I felt like a pro
oh and then I stuck put in the teeth
whitening gel onto the tray they put
them into my mouth and then you just use
like a little LED light that comes with
it just to put on your teeth as well
just to make it go a little bit faster
this was really awesome I did get really
incredible results so if you want to see
my full results I will be posting
pictures on Twitter and Instagram soon
but now I'm going to go ahead and while
I'm waiting for my teeth continue I'm
just going to take off my makeup with my
cleansing oil and wash all my makeup off
in once I have all my makeup off I am
gonna go in and do a face mask now I
don't really know the name of the face
mask that I use I kind of forgot and I'm
a little too lazy to go look I was just
one of the glam glow ones I will list it
down below it's the one that makes your
face pretty much look like the Tin Man
and I was really excited to use this
collection everyone use it and I finally
decided to find it and try it out and if
you're wondering yes Noah actually did a
face mask with me as well I found this
little clip he did behind the scenes I
was like oh my gosh what are you doing
yeah we did face masks together so once
I have all that arms gonna hang out my
room read some books on my face mask
dries and while my teeth are whitening
away
after a peel off my mask which is
actually the best part and rinse out my
smiling my teeth whitener it's time for
me to shower for my hair I'm loving my
bio taro which is actually a
professional brand but the value option
to matrix by Lodge they're actually
doing a huge relaunch of their products
in October and calling it the feel-good
hit of the year in man and by loving
their new lines I look like a crazy
fanatic when it comes to shampoos and
conditioners and I'm always trying new
ones and these are by far my favorite
they've all actually been reformulated
to have more botanicals more extracts
and absolutely zero parabens which is to
die for
and I'm currently using the long and
healthy line and yeah so then I'm going
on to shave my legs and wash my body and
all that good stuff
and let's take it out I'm going to go
ahead and brush my teeth to drive my
hair up a little bit I actually just let
it dry while I sleep tonight cuz girl is
lazy and I'm also going to put on a
little bit of lotion just on my arms or
my legs if that scam feeling baby soft
and baby because just because I feel
like it okay and then when I'm done with
that I will grab myself a glass of water
and head to my bedroom where I'll sit
there usually on my phone for like
thirty minutes sometimes longer so I'm
ready to go to sleep and then I will put
down my glass of water and just keep it
there in case I wake up extra thirsty
during that I could grow as first
now once I get all snuggled up in my bed
it's time for me to go to sleep but
before I do so make sure to give this
