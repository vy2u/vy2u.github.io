information and let's get started okay
so first first first first versus this
video just had a quick sponsorship with
Papa Martha let's be serious you can all
see me use Poshmark five million
bajillion times so this is like the best
sponsorship for me I remember there the
time you guys like okay Lindsey chill
out because I didn't realize every time
I was posting to Poshmark I was sharing
into my Twitter and I realized I had
shared like 500 million posts to Twitter
in like to 20 minutes and I'm like oh
sorry guys I just wanted everyone see
what that just shows how much I already
honestly love the abso Papa Mark is an
app that you can apply and sell your
clothing and accessories
I love Poshmark it is a great way to
make like tons of money I will link pop
art in the description box so you can
download it just an app is free to
download basically you can take picture

points how much you want to sell it for
how much you originally paid for it fits
middle with tags all of them ourselves
we tied a brand and stuff you post it
woloson shares your twitter facebook
instagram if you like and I have had
such great luck with this and I have
sold so much as such a great way to make
money it's such a great way to recycle
your clothes get rid of things you're
not using anymore I love pot market it's
super easy because you lock like make a
shipping label or anything they do all
that for you all you have to do is print
the shipping label once someone buys
your stuff that goes straight to send
your shipping label to your email you
print it out and you're not you don't
have to pay anything for shipping which
is so so nice I will be adding a bunch
of new stuff my Poshmark

California to Ohio I told you guys that
I would be adding a ton of stuff anyway

up my closet so I have
stuff I will be adding on there so you

go ahead and feel free to leave your
username and down below and I will check
yours out maybe I'll share some of your
stuff on there and yeah but anyways guys
maybe do is a Casanova try on whole
actually got a few requests for this in
my last video and I was like well good
honey because I just got a bunch of
stuff in budget or what those could tie
me and I've always you know you guys
know that I will give you my complete
100% honest review but I was super
excited to do this number one we have V
style Paolo striped pants these are
definitely out of my comfort zone but I
was like these are so cute online
they're so cute on the model I've got to
try these and I love them first off I
think they think anyone's legs look
super good because the stripes kind of
elongate your legs you know because just
makes your legs look like they're look
longer I guess it is pretty high waisted
so if you go with any kind of like
regular top or crop top I plan to wear
this maybe was like a white cropped top
I think that'd be really cute oh I
actually really love these I was really
surprised because I was nervous I'd get
them but dangit Lizzie why'd you do this
you knew you weren't gonna wear
something so crazy but honestly I see
myself wearing is pretty soon check my
Instagram see if I wear them too and let
me know if not reminding you to wear
them next was surprise surprise I got a
body food you guys know I have so many
biases just because I love tucking
shirts into my shorts and my pants so
body suits just makes that a little bit
easier so this is a very beautiful like
light mocha color I love the color this
is gorgeous
I love the color it's just a type pretty
simple why food with like that buckles
at the bottom so grateful for the
buckles at the bottom I hate when you
after like you have to pee and there's
no buckle and you have to like get on
directors like that is like why I'm
going to do love this blog it's pretty
simple but I think if you pair it with
some cute jewelry works like some casual
jeans you could really really make this
super cute and actually soft actually
it's like super soft
surprise surprise everybody dude there's
no one said girl power it's got like two
lightning bolts and stars at the bottom
this one does not have the buckles I was
a little sad but like it's okay I will
deal with it so really cute I knew I
didn't have buckles my fellow online but
I was like
getting that because I'm totally 100%
about girl power so how could I pack
this up and I love the bright colors
this is super bold super like hey
statement shirt and I was really five
especially for the summertime
the bright colors look awesome so I
really end up going in order of all my
body foods because here is age number
one don't worry I have a lot more than
just icing this one has a pink bodysuit
pretty similar to the last one
same exact like design is kind of like a
tank top t-shirt tight bodysuit very
casual this one says California Republic
and obviously since I just moved back
from California I felt like I had to
have it and in my top of my final blogs
dude you may have seen this on my
Instagram story because I if you can
play try this on I was in love with it
this is a super cute stripe to buy food
it has a lace-up tie in the front I love
this house a really chunky tie almost
work is like a long that goes in my
opinion I love the colors it really
pretty like pale pink and like a navy
blue love this for summer the screen
summer to me it's so pretty on it's very
form-fitting very just makes your body
look good cuz its form-fitting and the
materials a little bit thicker which I
like it's not super fit it feels
extremely well quality so I'm very happy
with it oh it comes with the buckles
yeah got this rubber this is one of my
favorite and look what the direct
actually looks like a summer dress but
it is a romper and they've really
gorgeous cut out in the front just
around your stomach area with also a
little like short but not short the mini
lace-up like scrunched design right here
with some ties my front I love the
floral pattern I love how Chloe the
bottom Lars is so cute for a date night
actually I did wear this already on date
night when I went out me no one else
likes you nice go and I loved it I felt
super cuteness next is a feature that
you absolutely happy knowing Instagram
because I posted it on my regular day if
you fall non-trans you're not what do
you do with school ball we love you self
promo this is just a really cute
mah t-shirt super casual of obviously
this is you can wear it just like this
if you want but it is very slouchy at
the top so it kind of meant to be over
there over your shoulders which is how I
saw online that's how it was online is
over
shoulder at the top and also they tie
the bottom and well which is what I did
when I try it on because I kind of
wanted to mimic out look behind to see
how it's supposed to be but you could
just wear this as a plain casualty but I
liked wearing it the way or so on line
like I said I loved this so very
versatile very great to just throw on
your heading outfits out the door with
like some casual jeans or something
that's what I feared with that same
shirt on my Instagram are these are
shorts right here these are called what
are these called I don't know I already
ripped the tag off oops
anyways these are like those new trendy
like long shorts almost capri type
things I was also nervous about fees
because I didn't have anything like this
but I love them I love them I love them
I think these are so cute I love the
rips at the bottom I love to cut out me
I love that they're longer in the back I
think these are very staple statement
standout trendy
very foundation they've got lots of
compliments on these when I was wearing
them and you guys gave me lots of
compliments online on my Instagram I
think these are perfect and honestly I
love this a sizing on these it's always
perfect as well
I always just follows a little sizing
guide when I'm ordering stuff online the
member does me wrong they always fit
exactly like they're supposed to
definitely an A+ for these next I have
this floral two-piece this is black and
yellow black and yellow black against
art this was very similar to another
two-piece you might have seen on
Instagram before it was like what's I
think it has like sunflowers on it or
lemons I think mines in limit either way
let's bring them or something I already
had which is my fault is getting
something but it's different up that I'm
still going to wear it so it's okay
and I do really love this I love the
black and yellow color I love the really
floral e roughly mischievous
I love the fact that it's a two-piece I
love two pieces because they're so easy
when you're looking for a really cute
outfit to just grab it and go your
outfits already done just okay also kind
of like romper Taylor just so easy and
this is really comfy as well and comfy
is key and this is great for summertime
as well but it's very breezy next and I
think this is absolutely my 100% of
favorite thing I got this is a very long
maxi type dress kind of like a dress
black romper it is this gorgeous mustard
color it is very very low the front you
could wear a nice bra
with it it goes all the way down to the
floor but underneath and it does have
yellow short so it underneath it is a
raw fur and then the lace that goes down
to the floor is actually a bit
see-through so you can see the shore
through it so it's like a robber with a
dress on top but I love this I felt like
I was in collecting awareness and Italy
that makes no sense oh that makes sense
I just think this is so gorgeous it very
much screams like where this one's a
pretty vacation looking out over the
beach beautiful photos I don't know I
love it I love the color I've been
loving mustard color originally this is
so pretty I don't know how many know how
to describe it I love all the lace I
love all the details is a so detail such
good quality is so stunning I love it I
just wanna wear this all the time I
better have a reason or that's really
soon and that is another fave I feel
like this would be so great to wear like
downtown or something it is also a
two-piece it is a like thicker type
material I love the colors it's white
with almost like blues and greens and
peach colors I love the toes of this it
is a two-piece it is strapless as well
but then also has these little but these
lace outlays for peace cause like ribbon
with two ribbons on each side of the
shirt that you tie around your arm to
make this pleasers I think it's so cool
so fun
I feel like this look like I said would
be perfect to wear downtown or something
with some cute heels I am very much
where this is also something you could
wear out one night this is very very
like sexy girl work it so this looks
very flattering on it's like anyone
would wear this and you would look bomb
a F so definitely an A+ for this one I
plan to wear this one I'm very very Sam
