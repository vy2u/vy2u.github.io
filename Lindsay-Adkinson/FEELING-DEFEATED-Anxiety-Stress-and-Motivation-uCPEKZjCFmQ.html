feel bad we feel sad we feel upset you
feel defeated but feeling defeated
doesn't mean you are defeated maybe it
means you got the best of you maybe it
means something went wrong or your needs
weren't met or you let stress get
overwhelming or you were anxious or you
didn't meet a goal you wanted and let's
be real it does not feel the greatest
like feeling defeated or bad or
depressed or down or anxious or stressed
lot of it feels good it's like it's so
weird that we all pretend like it
doesn't happen not everyone but the
majority of people don't show that they
feel defeated or they're sad including
me most of us want the whole world of
things that we feel happy that we're
filled with love and that we're
successful and for the most part for the
most part I am but everyone feels sad
sometimes everyone has bad days
everyone has times that make them feel
not so great and because no one shares
those feelings everyone feels more alone
you know it makes you feel overall we
feel like a failure because you think no
one else is failing you feel like
everyone is doing so great like why
aren't I
for like some fleeting moment and then
later on obviously you realize like no
no that's just my mindset and of course
everyone says like it's the power of the
mind it's your mind get a change your
mind you got to change your attitude
nice preach this every day and you
should but sometimes we just have that
moment or that feeling and just so you
know you're not alone I have days where
just like everyone else where I don't
want to get out of bed I have days that
I should be going to the gym and I end
up on the couch all day binge watching
TV I have cried myself to sleep before I
have struggled to pay bills I have had
awful breakups I have had breakups where
I went crazy and called them multiple
times like I have been there
and I still get there just click
everyone else and it's like of course
all my showed of the world is the good
the great the love the happiness because
that's what I want to show because
nobody wants a pity party
nobody wants some people to feel bad for
presence softly I don't want you to ever
feel bad for me because my life is great
so what you have to do is let yourself
feel those feelings if you need to cry
cry if you need to yell scream into your
pillow is louder to meet you you don't
want to make your bed don't make your
damn bed because it's okay to have a day
and right now and then where you just
feel and but here's what we don't do we
don't stay in those days we don't stay
to those ways we get it out of our
system whether you need an hour what do
you need 20 minutes whether you just
need a whole day let yourself feel and
then nourish yourself like you would
nourish a friend you see a friend having
a bad day what do you do tell them to go
really well the light a candle eat some
chocolate you know watch your funny
movie
tell yourself those things because you
are worthy of that happiness you are
worthy of feeling good again and always
feeling good as much as possible so you
go read a book and eat some chocolate go
to bed early get some rest nourish your
body nourish your mind like you know
take the hottest back of your life if
you want you know watch a million funny
movies not a million that would take too
long read a good self love book and
remind yourself things are working out
things are going to be fine
all the things you stress about or going
to work out and you know you know they
will in the back of your mind you know
everything is going to be okay but
sometimes we follow that weakness and
that is okay because we're a human we
are real and they're all in this
together one thing we can all do is be
kind to each other and remember that as
much as everyone shows their happiness
at home everyone has sadness as well
nobody is perfect everyone is human we
all have those days so I love you guys
very much yes I was having a bit of a
bad day yesterday I cried for like every
other hour because I was comparing my
YouTube channel to everyone else and I
felt
failure and I realize I'm not a failure
you know I just can be a little too hard
on myself or I can you know I can I'm my
worst critic we are always we are our
own worst critics and you got to work on
that I've got to work on that you know
so of course after a few hours of
beating myself up I finally realized 1z
no you know you work hard it's going to
pay off and you work hard it's going to
pay off so whatever you're fretting
about please know it's all going to be
okay I love you very much
maybe I'll make some my next video will
be something where next video like this
will be something on how to get out of a
bad day how to get out of a rut let me
