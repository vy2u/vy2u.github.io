channel today I'm doing a fitness
motivation you guys have asked so many
times like how do you stay motivated how
do you push yourself to get up in the
morning and go work out and yeah that's
why I'm going to be telling you guys
today now the first thing is to make a
schedule I feel like I don't I don't
workout if I just wake up in the morning
inside hey I think I should go work out
I mean if you wake up in the morning and
think can you feel like working out
that's a good day to go work out because
you're motivated but I'm saying like I
don't wake up in the morning and things
like okay I'm gonna work out you know I
just I make a schedule of the days I'm
going to work out a week ahead a week in
advance so that way I know which days
I'm going to work out it's kind of like
instead of making it like a chore it
just becomes part of my daily schedule
and next is to have some cute
personalized accessories now one thing
you can do is a personalized water
bottle now all you do is take the water
bottle and what I did is I took one that
I had from Whole Foods a 79 cent water
bottle I told I tore the little peeling
off and then I just took paint
splattered it on the bottle and I took a
straw to blow around the paint which
gives like a watercolor effect and then
because I wanted to I added a few
stickers just because and then I have a
really cute personalized water bottle
and another thing I like to do is take a
little workout plane with me I just take
some card stock that I got from just any
kind of like Michaels Hobby Lobby and
then I put like a little paper clip on
it just so I can find it easily in my
purse and it makes it even cuter and
what I like to do is on the front I like
to plan out my work out the exact
workouts I want to do if I'm going to
the gym instead of a workout class and
then on the back of the card I like to
write out some sort of inspirational
quote so whenever I pull out my workout
list to see what I have left to do I can
turn it around and have one little extra
thing to like boost my motivation number
three is to find motivation in outside
sources things like Instagram Tumblr
Pinterest there's so many different
blogs and boards and everything of
motivational things you can follow I
personally like to do it or on Instagram
I don't really use Tumblr Pinterest much
but I like to follow a bunch of like
fitness gurus or people that I like in
my era you know that kind of stuff so I
will list my favorite Instagram is down
below if I remember if I don't comment
let me know and then I will do it I
definitely think finding someone or some
some people some posts you can look up
to it
really good idea because then when
you're scrolling through Instagram or
scrolling on tumblr you're gonna be like
oh wait hey this gives me a reminder I
want to you know I can do this too I can
look just like this I can be like this I
can be healthy strong except so the next
thing I'd like to tell you is to find
cute workout clothes now this doesn't
have to be crazy expensive you can get
workout clothes anywhere but I just
think I don't I like to dress nice but I
like to look cute when I go out you want
to go to the you know go work out on the
gym it's like I don't feel as motivated
when I mention ET shirt and shorts but
what I'm in like q yoga pants and a cute
top I feel more motivated to go because
I'm I want to get out the house it's
like hey I look cute let's go now one
thing I really like is my new jumpsuit
that I got from a shallow Jade I really
wanted one of these for like forever so
I finally got one and I still like it
because the company and stuff itself is
like a really good company it's two
women that are really all about
empowering each other and empowering
women which is a great thing and their
actual like a meaning for their company
is that Shawna Jade is a lifestyle that
seeks enlightenment through the practice
of unconditional love for oneself and
others I just love that like but these
are so freakin comfortable these are
like really perfect for any kind of
fitness I really like them for yoga
they're really comfortable these are so
comfortable they're super stretchy which
is like perfect they're like
form-fitting it's almost like a second
skin if that makes sense like I almost
feel like it's part of me so I can move
around really easily and I sweat a ton
like girl I get stinky when I work out
let me just be honest I sweat so much
and you sweating it more when you do
yoga it's like a long story but you
really do you sweat so much when you do
yoga and this like instantly makes me
dry I really like that I know I think
it's like the material it's kind of like
the triangle swimsuits where it's just
like instantly like the water just like
dries I I love that because girl I don't
like when my shirt gets all like that's
gross what I like to do as well as
whenever I feel like I don't want to go
to the gym I like to tell myself okay
you don't have to go to the gym if you
can name five to ten reasons why you why
you can't go and all my reasons if I've
ever made is I don't want to like or
it's going to be hard like and that's
not an excuse so I think that's a really
good ways whenever you feel like you
can't do it
name the reasons why you can't and
you'll realize there really aren't any
reasons there's only excuses and I
really hope this video helped you guys I
love you so
much you're beautiful you're awesome no
matter who you are no matter what you
doin I don't care green pizza bowl walk
to this you're still beautiful I love
pizza so you want to share probably not
because I don't live with you but yeah I
love you guys so much and I will see you
all in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
