and wait a minute I should probably not
lift up my arms like that anyways happy
2016 guys I hope you had a wonderful
start to your new year today's video is
a tips and inspirations on getting our
butts in shape and staying in shape now
I was doing really good with fitness as
well in 2015 I think for about eight or
nine months of the year I was really on
track I was working out like four days a
week I was getting really healthy but
let me be honest when Foster and I broke
up if you didn't know I mentioned that
videos before but sometimes I don't
think everyone watches every video you
don't follow my social media so you
might not have known but false and I
broke up a few months ago and I kind of
just slacked a ton um I stopped working
out kind of completely I didn't work out
at all for a few months I was eating
back for just one so I was little I
ordered pizza and Chinese like every
night really bad really bad but
sometimes you need to binge and just let
yourself go for a little bit so it's
okay but sorry 2016 I'm getting back on
track and I'm hoping you guys want to do
it with me
like I said 2016 is getting really
different in a good way I don't want to
just do videos about morning routines
and stuff that you guys may care about
but it really doesn't do anything for
you so I really wanted to do a lot more
things so let me know in the comments
any videos you want to see for 2016
maybe I can do a video about breakup
since I just went through one is that an
idea of me all right I love you guys
very very very very much and let's go
ahead and get into the video the first
thing is to start immediately obviously
if you are watching this video maybe you
just stumbled upon this video but
whenever you start thinking like oh my
gosh oh my ear itches every day start
thinking I want to get in shape I want
to get healthier start then unless
you're like on a bus home from school or
like a driving home from work then wait
till you get home but start immediately
start immediately or as soon as possible
because that's when you're inspired and
where you're like motivated that's the
time to do it because you're wanting to
do it so don't get motivated to work out
and then think like oh I'll start in two
days just because it's like a certain
like say say you're like oh I'm gonna
start on Friday know if you're
motivating now start now
then also you need to work to keep
yourself inspired because that's what's
going to keep you going
it's feeling motivated and feeling
inspired to do something make sure when
I get up and do it because it puts you
in a good mood about it I'm here to help
your happy about doing something you
want to do it that makes sense obviously
like if when you don't want to work out
it's really hard to work out so keep
yourself inspired follow lots of like
fitness blogs subscribe to a fitness
magazine hang up posters make like
inspiration boards make your phone
background something that inspires your
workout just do something every few days
it keeps you inspired and keeps you
wanting to continue your journey next
our progress photos some people are
really anti progress photos and I say
who cares
because if seeing yourself and your
progress makes you want to keep going
then do it honestly I'm telling you
seeing your results really pushes you
it's like the results are what keeps you
going because you're seeing like oh my
gosh my body's making a change or I feel
better all that stuff like it really
really does help so take a photo the day
you start working out right before you
go and then maybe once a week keep
taking photos or every few days or
however often you want to and you're
gonna see you don't have to post them
anywhere if you don't want to but if you
want to post them girl post them or boy
post them if your boy watching this you
can watch it too you can also take
progress photos I seen the boys post and
those little yeah we know you do it too
we know but seriously
posting or share and keep them for
yourself just just take them so you can
like feel good about yourself like wow
look at this change that I made in my
body go me and next is to write down how
you feel afterwards now you don't have
to do this every single day but maybe
once a week write down how you feel when
you're done working out because a lot of
times I would wake up in the morning and
I'm like oh I really don't want to go
work out and like you have these
negative thoughts about why you don't
want to go like oh I just don't want to
I don't feel like it yadda yadda yadda
yadda you know like stupid things that
like I just you feel
you hate it when you first wake up like
oh I hate working out they hate it but
then typically after you work out you
feel really happy I was like oh my gosh
I did it I completed it I feel good
about myself it was awesome I feel
pumped and exhausted but in a good way
so typically when you're done working
out you feel really good so write down
how you feel after your workout so those
mornings when you wake up and you like
oh my gosh I really don't want to do it
I feel like it's gonna be terrible look
at your like written response from
before how you feel afterwards and it
might remind you like oh my gosh I'm
hating it now but when it's over with
I'm gonna be really glad that I did it
next is to make it fun you don't have to
do push-ups and squats um being healthy
it's just about being active and taking
care of yourself
honestly if you want to dance around in
your living room for an hour
that's literally fine and you are
someone who's gonna be going to a gym or
working out with other people
I do recommend getting cute workout
clothes that always sounds so silly to
me when I would watch these like um
fitness motivation videos last year when
I was trying to get like in shape but it
really does work because I would notice
that I get to the gym and like my
t-shirt and like my old yoga pants and
everyone else a lot of people look
really cute and I'd feel kind of like oh
so conscious like Daniel action of you
know looked a little better I don't know
it is such like oh that's such a weird
thing to think about but it's the truth
so I went to Target and it's really like
they have pretty inexpensive workout
clothes and then the next time I went to
the gym I was like whoa I feel so much
better I feel like I'm looking good at
the gym I'm confident and I love cute
and what's better than that the
confidence is key to everything so if
you want to buy cute workout clothes if
you're going out with people or just for
yourself at home buy cute workout
clothes I don't have to be expensive but
get do what you want the next thing is
to remember the ABS are made in the
kitchen now you can't have um this huge
fitness journey and workout every day
and then go home and eat like junk food
all the time
it's kind of just going to counteract it
and it's not really gonna do any good
for you you're not really going to see
results make sure you're drinking all of
your water make sure you getting your
daily servings of fruits and vegetables
and that way your when you are eating
junk food you're not eating a whole bag
of chips but instead maybe you're
getting like a little plastic baggie of
chips instead and you're just making it
more proportioned and just just remember
abs are made in the kitchen it's easier
said than done
I know trust me I know it's easier said
than done but just remind yourself
like when you're eating that that's
really going to be a big part of your
fitness journey is your diet now if
you'd like me to make some healthy food
recipe videos we know in the comments or
give this video a thumbs up and I can do
that as well because I know the eating
can be expensive it's hard to think of
like fun or recipes but healthy foods
can still taste really good so let me
know if you do want to see healthy foods
video and I can do that as well and the
last one is reward yourself for doing
good reward yourself in any way that
makes you feel good get let yourself
like buy that extra special thing you're
wanting to buy or reward yourself with
like a piece of cake honestly like if
you've been eating really healthy all
week reward yourself with a piece of
cake and that's gonna remind you like oh
my gosh if I do really good for a few
days I get cake that is all of my tips
and inspiration and motivation for
staying on track of this New Year's and
getting yourself in shape if you'd like
me to do some fitness workout routine
videos maybe workouts to do at home
healthy food videos all that good stuff
let me know the comments and also give
this video a thumbs up and this video
waits to 1,000 thumbs up but we can do
that then I know that you guys want to
see more healthy lifestyle videos that I
will keep those coming for you I know
for a while I was doing the
transformation Tuesdays which is where I
was doing like healthy stuff all the
time and I stopped doing those I need to
get back on track like I said life was
hectic
