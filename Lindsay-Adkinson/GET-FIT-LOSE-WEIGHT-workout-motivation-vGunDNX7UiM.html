video I want you to know you are
beautiful never think that you have to
have a certain body type body shape
Bonnie wait anything to go to where some
Susan you're perfect how you are these
are just the tips and workout that I do
to stay in shape and to stay healthy
there is nothing wrong going to be
healthy but know that being healthy does
not mean trying to look like someone
else so just know you already have a
bikini body just how it is this is just
ways to feel more confident and maybe
feel a little bit healthier and good and
happy I love you very much I mean
everyone the bottom of my heart and I
the thing like that staining to say that
make myself feel better I want you to
know you truly are beautiful the way you
are I don't want you ever coming to my
videos and feeling bad about yourself
because they love you now let's go ahead
and decide and watch the video
okay guys so having good workout
equipment and cute workout clothes and
accessories really really does help keep
you on track and motivated for working
out now I've recently become in love and
obsessed with Ellie which is a seasonal
fitness subscription box which for 49.99
you get a full box of teal workout here
and I mean you can't even get a shirt at
Lululemon for that cost so I mean it's
pretty great
now this month I got some really awesome
Fitness fans a massage roller a really
really cute workout outfit including
these for all you see I'm wearing in the
video and at the best water bottle of my
entire life literally my drinks have
stayed cold for all all day let me look
at that rose gold color hi guys now
cardio is your best friend when it comes
to getting healthy and noticing the
biggest change in yourself and I love
running particularly on the treadmill
but you can also go outside or with a
friend go to cool places it's so good
for your body but also for your mind I'm
really always in the best mood when I'm
done running so definitely get outside
and go run or just do some type of
cardio
on to the rest of my workout I always
make sure to start out with stretching
maybe even some light yoga if you prefer
and I also love love love using my
massage roller from Ellie because I had
a really tight back first I'm using the
resistance bands from my box to do some
arm workouts you could also use weights
then I'm doing some variations of table
top leg lifts to work my butt but again
you can also add some resistance which
is why I freaking love these bands
because they're so versatile now you
obviously can't forget your squats
because hey da booty da
moving on I always do pelvic lift
sometimes we'll even add a ball in
between my thighs for some inner thigh
work at the gym but because I would sell
me the pool to look cool I did not have
one handy so I use my resistance bands
as well and also really like to doing
that as well now to strengthen my core I
love playing I can do them on I'll do
them on my hand my forearms and then on
my side just for as long as I can or
till I feel like I'm gonna collapse or
like die
now for my obliques I love doing heel
touches next I'll do some crunches now
remember I do have back issues so my
crunches kind of suck and I kind of
we're doing that but I do my best then
I'll finish off with some leg lifts and
some scissor kicks drinking water is so
easy it's so important I know it's the
biggest difference when I started
drinking a full amount of water every
day and honestly with my le bottle I
honestly drink even more because it's so
pretty to you and I just bring it
everywhere but yes drink all of your
water is so important
last but not least and most important is
your confidence go out and rock your
swimsuit be happy love yourself put a
smile on your beautiful face you are hot
sexy pretty cute every attitude that you
want to be so love yourself and realize
the biggest health change starts with
your mind you're so beautiful and I love
you and I hope you have a beautiful
