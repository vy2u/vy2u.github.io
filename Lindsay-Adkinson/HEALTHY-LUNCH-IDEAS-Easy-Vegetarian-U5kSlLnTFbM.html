healthy lunch ideas I find the lunch is
the hardest time for it was the hardest
time for me to eat healthy because I'd
be out and about and so I'd pick up fast
food so watch has been the place I've
really tried to focus on getting
healthier because that's really helped
me and my whole fitness transformation
journey so today I'm gonna be showing
you three or four of my favourite
healthy lunch ideas let me know in the
description box what your favorite
healthy foods are and bean kind of swap
ideas and help each other and also to do
this is also a collab with my good
friend the classy girl first off she's
gorgeous she is so gorgeous she makes a
really awesome video she has the cutest
voice on the planet I just want to watch

so sweet

I eat in a day video so after you watch

her video give her a thumbs up subscribe
to her all that good stuff you won't
regret it and if you are new to my
channel from her channel welcome and I
hope you subscribe and without further
ado let's get into the video so for this
first one I just cut open a croissant
and then I toast it on both sides and
then I decide to fried 2 eggs and put
the eggs on top of the croissant and
then last I decide to dice up an avocado
I should have used the full avocado but
I just used half and I cut it up into
some big chunks and then I just put it
on top of my egg do another thing you
can also do is submerge the avocado and
kind of use it like a paste and put it
underneath the egg but this is the way I
prefer to do it but either way is super
delicious and I also added a Waymon a
which is a probiotic chai tea drink
super delicious they're really good for
you you can get them at Whole Foods and
for the second one I just used a penne
pasta and I use about 3/4 cup and I
boiled it in a pot of water for about 12
minutes and then I also sauteed some
mushrooms with a little bit of olive oil
and some seasoning and then last I took
one tablespoon of Greek seasoning or
Greek dressing put them in a bowl and I
was all done and then by the way I did
realize all of these recipes only take a
three ingredients so how easy is that
this last one is one of my favorites for
lunch I just heated up some black beans
and some corn in a pot on the stove and
then I decided to cut up a yellow pepper
you can also use green peppers red
peppers tomatoes whatever else you have
in whatever you want to use this is just
what I had and what I wanted and I just
add all three of these into a bowl mix
it up add some black pepper and I'm good
to go this is so delicious and so easy
