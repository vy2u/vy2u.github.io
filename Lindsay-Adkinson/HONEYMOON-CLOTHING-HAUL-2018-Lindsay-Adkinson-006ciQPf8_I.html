welcome if you are new when you are
watching this video know and I will
officially be married and on our
honeymoon which is amazing two things
but what right now we actually currently
have about five days until we leave to
go get married and for our honeymoon if
you guys don't know we are getting
married in Santorini Greece and then
honeymooning and Paris and Venice and
they also have like a few days in New
York before we come home as well so I
obviously had to do a good bit of
shopping not a good but I'm wearing a
lot of things that argue in my closet
but I did want some things because we
will be gone for so long the first thing
is that we're doing a lot of stuff
online from a store called valishia
katana which I'm probably not saying it
correctly this video is sponsored by the
LIA katana just want to let you guys
know that but all opinions are my own
but leha katana is a very super cute and
unique clothing brand from Puerto Rico
now their clothes are perfect for spring
and summer could have a very like beachy
boho vibe and I love their stuff because
it is amazing that their stuff is hand
printed and died on rayon fabric from
Bali eliminated quantities of everything
so when you wear something from them
you're not pretty much gonna see very
many people also wearing it so you feel
very unique when you're wearing their
items first up is very beautiful blue
and white like bussiere type crop top I
love the pattern on this it's like blue
and white flowers with little bitty
yellow accents if you look close enough
I love the ruffle on the shoulders if
you plan on wearing that crop top with
these shorts right here these are some
high-waisted white like cinch type
shorts are actually pretty flowy at the
bottom next I got this beautiful orange
dress I told you guys earlier orange and
yellow are like my two favorite colors
for spring and summer I love that this
is not like super low cuff it is a
little bit lower cut it also has a
cutout details on the side I also got
this gorgeous white maxi dress this is
so pretty I'm actually someone who
doesn't tend to wear a lot of maxi
dresses but I did find that I bought a
lot of them before this trip because I
feel like they're gonna look so good for
the locations I'm gonna be at this also
has a really beautiful like delicate
lace I've got a beautiful layered
necklace they have some of the prettiest
jewelry probably my favorite things they
get is their jewelry because this looks
so so delicate and so
and we'll really really good with all
the pieces that I think out oh girl it's
so cute I thought this was gonna be tiny
I love that it's not as small they
thought it was gonna be oh so cute I
also pick out this pendant necklace it's
got a cute little sunshine on it I love
that it's gold oh girl I also got a pair
of shoes from the Levi's Gitana
but the bottom of them are very very
soft almost like a foam like so I mean
very comfy to walk in and walk on all
day especially when I'm traveling
walking around I'm not someone who likes
to wear tennis shoes I ain't know most
people with my hair is a mess like to
wear tennis shoes and they're walking
around
I cannot stand tennis shoes my feet get
all sweaty and gross and I don't like it
so I love wearing like slides and
sandals these are so cute comfy I feel
like these will honestly go with
everything I'll definitely check out the
leha katanas website I will have the
link to their site and all the items
that I picked out and down below alright
and then I would something at Macy's and
a Nordstrom
so avenues actually just got one a pair
of jeans I am look pretty cheap and I
usually don't buy expensive denim
however I have really wanted a pair of
like really simple light wash jeans if
it being really really nice and these
fit so so well everyone has told me
these are gonna fit really nicely they
look really good on I wanted them
without any rips and then because I have
most of my jeans are ripped out but all
I has is just this one rip in the knee
so I feel like that's not a big deal and
they looked so good on they look so good
on girl got a booty in these jeans I
ain't mad about it and I did get an RV
I'm guys this is my first time ever
shopping at Nordstrom and awkward
there's a little hygiene thing on you
hope that's mine
then that's gonna turn that around
you're gonna wash my hands be right back
and we're not gonna touch that again
okay I'm back just washing my hands
because I don't hold us mine
anything it is there's no slim sis in
here that's kind of gross I get this one
yellow dress from the Topshop section
and it's very cute very simple and flowy
gonna be perfect with like some white
sandals and my white tennis shoes I also
got it really pretty like peachy a
floral tie front top I love the way this
looks on it's very like romantic vibe
and the last thing I got also from the
brand be Phe I'll say never heard of
that brand before but they have some
really pretty stuff is this really
beautiful floral Romberg I love the
colors when I saw on the hanger I wasn't
sure if I love the court with the color
combination but I really loved it on
it's like a really pretty nude of blue
it's like up some pops of purple and
brown and some peach colors in there
alright and then I got some stuff from
footer ever 21 you know I had to go and
get some stuff there first thing out
which is really simple like Rouge tank
top it's got little roses all over I
could tell that was roses or cherries
totally roses I thought this would be
really cute like on the plane maybe with
those new Levi's and some tennis shoes
and I also got this really pretty camera
mouth blue dress from forever 21 I was
so excited about this because I did see
something just like this at Nordstrom
but guys it was like 160 dollars and I
was like no so if I found this at
forever 21 for $20 and it looked
honestly so similar to the one I saw at
Nordstrom the last thing that I got from
everyone is this really a pretty maxi
dress I love the colors of this I loved
it has a slit the bottom I don't know
why I have so many maxi dresses I'm so
I'm such a jeans and t-shirt kind of
girl but I feel like when you go on
vacation it's nice to like wear dressier
flowy your stuff so I'm really excited
to try them on and like get out of my
comfort zone and lasting at least I got
some stuff from a dolls kill and I know
what you is thinking Lindsey what do
they have adults killed as your style
and honestly when I was looking in their
site they do have a lot of things that I
personally would never wear but hey if
you have the confidence to rock it rock
it but it's not my style but they do go
honestly still carry some really cute
stuff that isn't as like out there the
other pieces and a little bit more like
my style
the first thing I'm really a pretty sad
look really pretty white blue and this
little floral of those floral patterns I
don't know got a really fun
and really fun and really pretty I think
it looks really good on it's very
flattering and then I've got the
icebreaker cropped t-shirt I just really
like simple t-shirts like this I love
stripe teachers I think they're so cute
this one is really comfy what I was
really excited about so it is another
two-piece said it comes with a really
pretty white skirt and then also has a
white top now I haven't tried on you
I'll try it on in a second and then I'll
put the clips on I can tell this is
gonna fit me or not it looks like it
might be a little too big but it might
not we'll see you I'll be trying it on
we'll find out right next I'm really
into sets right now because it like it's
very easy to just have an outfit ready
to go I love this on days a bright
yellow and white like plaid set it's got
really kind of flowy type though
straight legged flowy tight pants and
it's like a tighter little top I love
this set I love the bright yellow this
is such a fun summer set I cannot wait
