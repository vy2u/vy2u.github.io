and I'm so excited hope you guys are too
and let's just go to with the video
alright guys so welcome back to my
channel or welcome to your new today
videos how to be popular now and
realignment deep down wants to be
popular you can call that whatever you
like you can call you want to be like
you want to have friends or people to
notice you everybody wants that feeling
and you can deny all you want
what's the truth now here's the thing
popularity is not being a cool kids does
mean to people popularity is not being a
certain friend group popularity is
having lots of people that like you
respect you and being a genuinely nice
person back now I'm going to tell you
high school middle school are tough call
it a diva tough especially when it comes
the whole world is tough everyone is
constantly judging everyone going off
with their parents tell them to think
you know trying to be cool and that is
not the way to go first off before we
get into this - I hadn't really let's be
honest a really shitty time in Middle
School in high school to the point that
I graduated high school one semester
early because I couldn't stand being
there any longer a to the point that I
dropped out of college was just going to
end up going back a year later for the
same exact degree which is what caused
me to you know to take
longer in school everything because I
didn't like being on people that weren't
necessarily the nicest it really sucks
that people judge others because of
where they live the clothes they wear
all that kind of stuff because it
happened is we need to fix that and if
you don't start by actively fixing it
that you aren't helping so I think that
knowing what I have gone through knowing
that people didn't like me sometimes
because of the help that I got off the
bus at because I wasn't always wearing
the most popular name brand clothes that
some of it or the cars of my mom or my
family dropped me often then I didn't
always have the most friends or people
didn't really like me and I don't think
that should be the case so today I'm
going to give you tips on how to
actually be a good positive popular
person someone that has a lot of people
that like them that are some that is
genuine someone that has good lots of
good friends and someone that also goes
out of their way to be a good person to
everyone else someone that makes other
people feel as if they have a lot of
friends we're pleased to my number one
that is to be generally nice to everyone
that means no matter what if they're
mean to you if your friends are mean to
them you'd be nice to everyone because
when you are the person that people know
is genuinely at night there tends to
want to spit by you they tend to want to
be around you because they feel like
they're near you you're going to be nice
and that niceness might robot roll off
on them make them feel good you don't
want people to ever be afraid to sit
near you or be around you so you want to
always be a generally nice person so
also the worst case I think some people
think that popularity means the Amin
cool-kid that's not true because the
worst kind of friendships are when
people are friends with you because
they're scared of you I literally was
best friends with this one girl for a
very long time because I was paired
terrified of her she would start so much
drama to the point that girl once came
to my house and threw rocks at my window
screaming horrid things I would solve
myself to sleep because of it and I was
still the next day go back and be this
girl's friend they were times that she
wouldn't let me sit at the table with
everyone and I would go sit by myself at
lunch and I never told her to stop
because I was afraid if I stood up for
myself and she wouldn't be my friend
again and it isn't the worst kind of
friendship now that I'm older I realized
why did I want to be friends with
someone because I was
to them so just be generally nine don't
be that person that's mean to people be
the person that tonight see the person
eyes open open arms welcoming to
everyone
number two is be confident confidence is
key to so much in life that means that
when hubero people are mean to be
confident if people say it want to like
the way you dress it'll it I love it
doesn't matter don't even listen to it
you need to walk around with your own
mental mix tape always telling yourself
how awesome you are and you'll notice
just being confident in saying those
things and making stuff feel confident
will make where you are a nicer person
happier and in a generally better mood
and that is going to be talking more
friends and being in better situations
so always be called by literally if you
have the stand up are near mirrors I
used to have to do and tell yourself I
am pretty I am smart I'm funny I'm a
nice person you know my situation where
I live does not define me then do those
things we're tall police in my next one
which is don't let anyone ever put you
down
if someone humor friends that is mean to
you stand up for yourself people if you
have random bullies that are meat you
stand up for yourself so do what it
takes to make sure that people can not
put you down do not lessen you don't
need to be violent I hate violence
violence is never the answer but stand
up for yourself if people are being mean
to you at a certain lunch table move to
another lunch table start your own lunch
table so when you actually make new
friends is try complimenting people if
you are trying to make a new friend
maybe walk up to someone and tell them
you like their hair maybe someone who
doesn't have as many friends walk up and
tell them hey I like the way you're
dressed or I like your binder I like
this or you know this gift of a combo
you have a nice smile because the
compliment going to make someone feel
good and you never know how that can
affect their day it will in turn if you
feel this for saying something nice even
if you're nervous
if are if you will feel so good
afterwards and that is a good way to get
someone to really open with a nice
person let their guard down and maybe
start to strike up a conversation and
make a new friend another way to meet
new people is maybe to join groups or
clubs usually people that Hin to be in
like certain groups and clubs are a good
way to find out people with similar
interests so even if you are in college
who can join like tons and groups in
clubs and different types of things to
meet new people the next thing is don't
talk about BA and you want because
a quick way to lose any friendships if
you're a widow and who is talking bad
about someone it doesn't mean you can't
be their friend anymore but don't
partake in their gossip if they are
talking about about so-and-so say I'm
sorry I don't feel comfortable talking
about them they're not here right now
and if you don't want to have that for
conflict you could also just not say
anything change the subject
perfect oh my gosh did you see what's
valium is where anything
I know not really but hey did you watch
the last episode of The Bachelorette
what do you think and eventually if you
keep changing the subject don't realize
that they are perk up they won't be bad
because they'll realize you just keep
changing a subject that you probably
shouldn't be talking about and they will
realize they will probably just forget
about it and talk about those things
with someone else which is great because
most likely girls talk about people when
they're jealous and you don't want to
you don't want to get caught talking bad
about Sally because maybe you just talk
about it with your friend because you
don't want to hurt her feelings with any
of her Italians and you may lose the
friendship so make sure to never gossip
or talk bad about anyone
another thing is just doing a nice
gesture for like the whole class when I
after I dropped out of college I
eventually realized I was on a bad path
don't worry guys I will be making a draw
my life very soon if you guys would like
to hear my whole life story please let
me help comments I'm kind of nervous to
do it I'm actually terrified but I feel
like it would be a good video if you
guys to finally know about my life so
let me know like to see that but when I
was back to college I realized that I
wanted to make friends this time I
wanted to do it the right way so my
first day it was a boy at first classes
I brought a bunch of like doughnuts for
everyone and everybody over half of so
nice thank you everyone's laughing the
teacher gave was like five is eat our
doughnuts and we were always having
conversations and I will tell you my
last graduating my graduating class from
college I had so many friends I made not
honestly I didn't make best friends for
the rest of my life but I had good
friendships and relationships so the
entire crust I would say that I was
generally was light and light everyone
in my class
why was that some people were very
different for me but I didn't judge them
and I didn't talk bad about them I
didn't for taking gossip I majored be
nice to everyone and very welcoming I
all the times strike up conversations
with everyone in the class I would
compliment girls to look like they may
need a compliment so from doing all
those things I had
greatest college experience in the end
and tons of friends I know I'm rambling
I just want you guys to know how much I
love you and how worthy you are and when
you all have a wonderful school year
whether you are going into middle school
