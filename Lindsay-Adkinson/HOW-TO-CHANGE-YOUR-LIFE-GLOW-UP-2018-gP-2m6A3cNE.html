entire video and realized it wasn't a
microphone on my camera and it was good
it was so good
hello beautiful babes I'm gonna call you
that today today's video is going to be
how to transform your life
sorry Milo's hair is always everywhere
because we all deserve to live a
fantastic financially free successful
loved worthy sexy that doesn't make
sense but incredible life okay we
deserve to live a life like that and if
you're wanting to transfer transform
your life whether it is due to finance
problems
I almost said money problems that's the
same thing getting in shape getting the
job you want having the friends you want
having the relationships you want
anything like that or just all of it
definitely watch this video and let's
just go ahead and get right into it
number one is actually super simple and
that is to changer I once to your I am
so often we say I want to go to the gym
I think I might need to film a video
today or I think I should call so-and-so
to set up a meeting I really want to
work with her I really want to work with
so-and-so when instead it should be I am
going to the gym today I am filming a
video today I am going to get off my
butt and call so-and-so and set up a
meeting and I am going to land my dream
job because when you say I am it is an
affirmative action it makes your mind
get more excited about it and think okay
we're actually doing this we're not
thinking about it oh Michael it's cute
we're not taking the backseat on it we
are taking the driver's seat and we are
going full force into whatever we're
trying to do and we are actually doing
it so use affirmative actions which
actually really sets you up for success
or - it's honestly a really serious one
and that is not being mean so many
people are mean in this world and this
may not apply to you but it does apply
to you please listen up there's nothing
cool about being mean there's nothing
nothing cool about gossiping there's
nothing cool about just mean being a
mean person I have people all the time
literally all the time that I know even
influencers that will say that they
think I'm fake lean ice or that I'm not
that nice in real life and the thing is
that's their problem not mine because if
you think someone's fakely nice you got
to ask yourself what is wrong with me to
think someone being nice isn't real
I really am a nice person because I
think being kind is cool and I think the
word
it's filled with so much hate especially
right now that we all need to play our
part to be nice to each other everyone
every single person has insecurities and
wants to feel 100 percent they want to
feel like they're just as good as
everyone out so go out of your way to be
nice to people make them feel worthy if
there's someone who's hanging out by
themselves in a party go introduce
yourself and say hi just like just like
if you're at a party and you're by
yourself you're probably wishing someone
else would come up to say hi to you you
know so play your part in the world and
realize that also if someone is being
mean to you that is on them not on you
that means they have some kind of issue
insecurity or fear that they need to
work on if someone isn't nice to you
don't even let it bother you because
obviously it bothers them enough that
they need to work on their issues and
you need to keep living your fabulous
100% incredible
what aren't you doing back there you're
incredible worthy like number three is
to do the work and I mean do the work so
many people not even kidding
I've messaged me when I talk about
manifestation and visible visualization
be like well I watch the secret and I
tried to manifest it and I visualize but
then I didn't get in shape or I didn't
get the job I want it or I didn't get
the work done I'm like well what did you
do after that and they'll be like well I
watched the secret and I made a vision
board and I visualize and I meditate
they're like well what else did you do
and sometimes people think that's what
you have to do no honey the world does
not come - you have to go to it if you
want to get stuff done you got to get
stuff done you got to get off your
bootay it took me a long time to do this
stuff I me too
I got to get off your butt and do what
the work if you want to live an
incredible incredible life you got to
work hard you know the good things in
life don't always come not easy so
sometimes you gotta if you want to land
your dream job you got to go to that
place and you got a harassment not
literally don't not literally but you've
got to go there you got to show up for
the interviews you got to make the
meetings you got a call you gotta get
out of your comfort zone you've got to
go to the gym you got to eat healthy you
got to do the work if you want your life
to work for you you have to do the work
- you've got to show up for yourself
which I know can be really
hard especially if you're not in a good
place if you're not in a good place just
remind yourself like okay I'm going to
do this work and it's gonna pay off the
next one is that it's okay to ask for
help hire someone or let your life be a
little easier so that means say if
you're youtuber you need to hire a video
editor say you need to hire someone to
help you clean your house or say you
need an intern or an assistant or
another thing no one I just actually
recently started doing this is using
hellofresh now I am partnering with them
on this video so we love using
hellofresh because it is so convenient
is delivered right to your door in
prepackaged pre-measure bags that are
insulated in recyclable and you can
choose your delivery day so you know
it'll be there for your busy schedule or
your busy week or your busy days so how
fresh makes it easy to cook balanced
delicious meals without having to meal
prep or grocery shop and for under ten
dollars a meal we love it because you
can try a new recipes and get out of
your comfort zone but it comes with step
by step directions so you know exactly
what you're doing
let you also get to try new things they
have three different styles of classic
veggie and family love it because it is
simple quick delicious and easy because
all the meals are designed to take
around 30 minutes some even 20 minutes
so it is super simple and quick if you'd
like thirty dollars off your first week
of hellofresh just go to their website
and enter promo code Lindsey Murray 30
next is knowing that your time is
important which means stop
procrastinating don't be on your phone
while you're doing other tasks or doing
multiple things at once get one task
done at a time I used to edit my videos
while watching other people's YouTube
videos and I would go back and forth and
realize that a project that state would
take an hour would end up taking
multiple hours because I was so busy
looking at other things and not getting
my work done your time is so important
you have just as many hours in the day
as anyone else so what are you gonna
make of that time you know I think it's
crazy when I look back and I think about
like last year even that I would spend
hours on hours on my phone and looking
at other stuff instead of getting my
work done when instead you should get
one task done at a time mark it off and
move on to the next that way you get
your stuff done it is over with and then
you can enjoy your own life enjoy your
time you also wanna make sure you're
taking care of yourself mentally and
physically so many people worry about
their life
stop thinking to take care of themselves
you've got to take care of your mental
health and your physical health make
sure you're eating your fruits and
veggies drinking enough water
going to the gym staying active
meditating but not just meditating you
know taking care of you you need that
time to feel good on the inside and take
care of your body you might not even
realize until you start being more
active and a little bit healthier how
much better it feels when you are taking
care of yourself and when you are
feeling at your peak or your bed your
utmost self you're gonna be able to do
more anyways you've also got to stop
comparing your progress and yourself to
other people comparing your progress is
always going to make you feel like
you're not doing enough but here's the
thing say that you let's put it in like
a race say that you're on mile five yes
there may be someone on mile 20 and that
makes you feel like you're not good
enough but there's also someone on mile
1 in mile 2 who might be thinking that
they are not good enough while you're
over here worrying but if we all just
worried about ourselves we'd all get a
lot more done we'd all realize that our
paths are meant to go at different paces
in different times also don't compare
yourself to people in general because
that is going to cause you to be
spiteful and negative and that goes back
to that being kind of being mean thing a
lot of time I feel like if someone's
being mean to me or they're talking
about about someone usually they have
their own issue and they're probably
comparing theirselves that's probably
something that brings out something if
you weren't comparing yourself to
someone you'd have no reason to talk
about that you wouldn't be thinking
about them they wouldn't be on your
radar like that you know so don't
compare yourself to anyone but yourself
which makes no sense so just don't
compare yourself you know your success
will come and it will come it is coming
if it's not here and it's on its way
love yourself cherish yourself and know
that there's no reason to obsess over
someone else's life because when you are
doing that you're not focusing on your
own life and last not least is learn to
be happy right now so often we think I
will be happy when I get to this point
in my life I will be happy when I reach
this milestone no girl cuz you know
what's gonna happen you will never be
happy that way because what's gonna
happen is you're gonna reach that if
you're just waiting for something to
happen to be happy you're gonna get to
that point in life and you're gonna wait
for the next mile
to be happy you will never be happy
unless you start being happy right now
be happy with your everyday life and not
waiting for something to come you know
we should be celebrating the small
things every single day we should be
celebrating the small wins the things
were grateful for the people around us
the fact that we're breathing and we're
alive every day so don't sweat the small
stuff don't think that you won't be
happy till you get somewhere and focus
on being happy right now right now get
out of your head be present love your
life you are so worthy of an amazing
life and I just hope that you really
really take that away from today I
really do and really work hard on these
things if you really feel like you know
you deserve a better life because you do
then write these things down and really
actively go for it they say you can make
a change in two weeks so try doing these
things every day for two weeks and just
see how much your life changes coz who
knows like if you were to change one
percent a day in a hundred days you'd be
a whole new person okay nothing you need
to be a whole new person you're
incredible but you get what I'm saying
you can go from being super negative to
the most positive person in that amount
of time so try these little things I
hope they work for you if you are new I
would love it if you'd like my content
