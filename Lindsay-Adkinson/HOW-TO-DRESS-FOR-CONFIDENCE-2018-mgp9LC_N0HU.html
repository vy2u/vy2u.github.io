or welcome if you are new today's video
is all about how to dress for confidence
now my stomach might be growling some in
this video I'm so hungry but I had to
get this done first so life is all about
trying to feel confident being confident
can affect so many different areas of
your life without you realizing it it
can affect your attitude your work mode
how you act toward your friends how you
act in relationships how you how nice
you are to yourself you know how happy
you are on a day to day basis feeling
confident and self worth is so important
now let me be serious and I am not the
most confident person on a day to day
basis I struggle daily just like
everyone else and I can struggle a lot
especially with my job being on social
media whenever we feel unconfident
usually have something to do with being
afraid or just our mind being a bit
jumbled it usually comes down to some
other issue and I definitely think you
have to work on confidence first before
you figure out how to dress her
confidence but I do think the outfits
you wear can encourage more confidence
and help you feel more confident on a
day to day basis now before we continue
make sure you are subscribed for
notifications on I do weekly subscriber
shoutouts so those of you who are the
most active on my videos so make sure
you go ahead and do that and let's
continue on this leads to number one
which is to be confident before you put
any clothes on in the morning when your
bare butt naked you gotta be confident
already or when you're in your PJs
whatever and the first way to be
confident is to work on your inner self
worth self confidence now there's so
many different ways to do that it is to
monitor to monitor the way you speak to
yourself monitor the way you talk about
others meditating can help and one thing
you can do is indulge in tons of
positive material and one thing I love
our audiobooks I love listening to
audiobooks when I'm getting ready in the
morning in the car or when I'm working
out and that is actually why I partnered
with audible because audible has an
unmatched election of audiobooks and
it's a great way to help bettering
yourself or help you be a better you but
my favourite audiobooks are you are a
badass big magic you're about us I'm
making money how to be a boss when you
use audible you get a credit every
single month to put towards any of their
books in their store now if you don't
like the audiobook you picked out you
can exchange them and also if you don't
use your credit that month it does roll
over to the next month plus with audible
all of your audiobooks are yours to keep
you can go back and re-listen any single
time you want
now audible is going to offer you guys a
30-day free trial plus one free
audiobook all you have to do is go to
audible.com slash Lindsey Marie or Tex

so number two is listening to your inner
voice when you try things on we all have
an inner voice that it's just trying to
help us out sometimes it doesn't put the
most part it does so a lot of times that
will try stuff on and bread I'm here
right over here no but yeah this is okay
I like it enough I mean it's it's not my
favorite but I mean it's fine I don't
like changing and then I'll go to
wherever I'm supposed to be going an
event or just to dinner or to the mall
and I feel like man I feel kind of
closed off reserved I don't feel my most
confident most wonderful self that I am
and you are too and I just don't feel
the best that could be however if I
switched out my outfit is something that
made me feel bad a or just my most
confident self I just sent that like
five times then I would feel a lot
better in those situations so I have
learned if you put something on whether
you're trying it on at home or trying
something on in a store if you don't
feel 100% about it then 100% take it off
next is to analyze your own closet and
see what you already have the most stuff
and what you already wear the most stuff
for me if you look at my closet I have
tons of tennis shoes and flat shoes I
have tons of skinny jeans I have tons of
crap crap tops crop tops graphic
t-shirts and button ups those are things
I wear a lot of and I wear a lot a lot
of the time if I pair any of those
together I tend to feel pretty great
with my outfit however if you look in my
closet I don't really think I have more
than one or two dresses and they hardly
ever get worn and pretty much anytime I
wear a dress or buy a dress
I don't feel too confident about it and
I don't really I'm not really happy that
I wore it and I always end up wishing I
wore something else so listen to what
you already own as well as or what you
own the most of and wear the most of
next is figuring out what you appreciate
versus what you actually want to wear
that was a big one for me because a lot
a lot of people can appreciate different
styles but doesn't mean you have to wear
them I struggled with that for a very
long time because when I first got on
YouTube
I was insecure AF and they took me a few
years to really realize that I would see
all these influencers wearing really
really girly fashion super pretty flowy
dresses and frills and boho stuff and I
was like that looks so good on them so
that means I should probably wear that
stuff so I buy all these items and then
I would feel so insecure in it I would
not feel confident I would not feel
myself and I finally started to realize
that when I listen to my own voice and
wore what I wanted I felt better so just
realize that just because you like
something on someone else does not mean
you have to wear it if you like
something on someone ask yourself do I
like that on her and I'm just
appreciating her and how she looks or
his or her style or am i wanting to put
that on my body and maybe that will help
you figure out what you appreciate
versus what you actually want to wear
next is that it is okay to use pinterest
and style icons that helped lead the way
just make sure to go back to the
previous one where I said appreciate
versus wear if you're looking for people
to help you put together your outfits
because listen just like no one just is
born with a million YouTube subscribers
no one is born with a fashion sense it
takes time and it took me a long time to
figure out how to even put a t-shirt and
jeans together so I found tons of people
whose style I felt like I really
resonated with and I really felt like
even looking at her photos or her style
made me feel confident I was like oh
that's such a confident outfit firm that
I knew that that meant that is a style I
should be looking at so it is okay to
find style icons using Pinterest just
make sure you're really listening to
your inner voice with the kind of style
and help that along the way if that
makes sense
and last not least is showing off your
confidence even if you're not feeling
perfect all the time when you're going
out somewhere or going anywhere
make sure you know walking really
reserved with a frown on your face and
you know seeming having a bad attitude
because that's not gonna make you seem
confident either so make sure to walk
around with the power pose hand on your
hips big smiles or whatever you you're
confident faces positive thoughts in
your head positive thoughts in your
heart and being nice to everyone around
you is also going to help as well but
hopefully this helps you guys and hope
