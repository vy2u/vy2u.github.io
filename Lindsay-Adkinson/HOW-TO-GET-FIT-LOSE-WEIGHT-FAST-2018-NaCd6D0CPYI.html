video today's video is all about how to
get fit now this is not my exact workout
routine but more like tips and tricks
you can use to get yourself in shape if
you would like to see it my workout
routine as well make sure to give this
video a thumbs up and I will know to do
that as my next fitness video obviously
I want to stress as much as I can that
all body shapes in sight sizes and types
are beautiful do not ever think by a me
making these types of videos that I am
saying that you need to look like
someone else or be someone else because
that is not true my very first tip is
actually gonna be a body positivity tip
and that is to stop comparing yourself
to other people and don't want to look
like someone else
I think it's perfectly perfectly okay to
want to better yourself we're not even
better yourself cuz you're perfect how
you are it's okay to want to get
healthier it's okay to want to put good
food into your body and fuel your body
but it is not okay to say I want to look
like this person you know I'm saying
which is kind of why I've slowed down on
testing those celebrity fitness videos I
think those are really fun videos to do
to see if their fitness routine works
but I think when I did that a lot of
people started thinking like oh well I
need to try it and look like this person
are you trying to look like this person
and I never want you to think that and I
don't want to do that to myself either
so that's why I stopped doing those for
a little while you know we are all meant
to have different bodies shapes sizes
everything like that so you got to
embrace what you got and learn to it
love the body you have and that is the
quickest way you're ever going to get
healthier is to love the body you
actually have already because once you
start loving yourself and really
cherishing yourself you'll want to take
care of yourself even more number two is
absolutely no shortcuts shortcuts are
the quickest way to not get in get in
shape or get fit all of those things are
below me they usually do not last and if
you do get results you will not see them
forever the quickest and only way to
stay healthy is to eat healthy and be
active that is the only real way to be
healthy is to be healthy there's no
magic pill that you can take and then
eat a bunch of Ben and Jerry's and then
your problems are all saw but I wish it
like that but it doesn't so you have to
be willing to do the work that it takes
to put in and promise you it makes seem
really tough in the beginning and it is
tough in the beginning it was tough for
me but you will see results and as you
see results you will feel better about
it and you will be more motivated to do
those things the next one is knowing
that abs are made in the kitchen I had a
really terrible diet for a long time but
I would still go to the gym and I would
see a little bit of results but not what
I really wanted I see a little bit of
definition but that was it and I was
like I'm doing so much work and it
finally hit me like it is my diet
everyone says abs are made in the
kitchen guys they are made in the
kitchen once you stop putting all of
that overly processed too much sugar too
much salt too much fried food in your
body that is when the real results will
happen you gotta know abs are made in
the kitchen you gotta be willing to make
a lifestyle change and not just a diet
if you really want to see results it
kind of is like going back to that no
shortcuts is you have to actually make a
lifestyle change not a diet when you're
saying I am gonna diet for two weeks
that is telling yourself okay I'm gonna
do for two weeks and then it's over and
that's not really gonna last you want to
say okay I'm gonna make a lifestyle
change I'm not gonna be some crazy
person that goes in calorie counts all
day and it's miserable I'm just simply
going to wake up eat some fruits and
veggies throughout my day along with my
other foods and I'm gonna make sure
drink enough water I'm gonna be active
and your start doing that forever and
make a lifestyle change and that's where
you're gonna see the forever long
results the next step is a little
different because that is actually kind
of the opposite of what I just said but
that is to also give yourself a break
let yourself be balanced I am like the
queen of a balanced lifestyle I will
never be someone that only eats fruits
and veggies 24/7 and I will also never
be someone who only eats junk food if I
eat too much of one I can't do it I
can't handle it I get too sick of either
one of them I have to live a balanced
lifestyle why because I want to and I
think it makes my life better I think
you have to give yourself cheat days or
cheat meals or donut you have to give
yourself things you want in life life
it's so short you want to enjoy life too
I personally think if I was to tell
myself
okay starting today I'm never allowed to
eat a doughnut I'm never allowed to get
fried food or any of this stuff again I
wouldn't stick with it within a few days
I'd be so frustrated I would just go and
binge on all of it what I used to do was
taking six doughnuts home and eating
them right then I will get one doughnut
or maybe two and have one that night and
one the next night but I have learned to
moderate it I don't eat a whole bag of
chips in one sitting like I used to I
would pour a little bit other chips in a
bowl take the bowl with me or take a few
Oreos onto a plate instead of the whole
Oreo bag and I hate to say it but you're
one of the people that leaves those
comments like I'd rather eat the whole
bag of chips that's fine you live your
life you'd do that but you aren't gonna
see the change and if you click on this
video I'm imagining you want to make the
change and so often people want to
sugarcoat things and say like oh no yeah
you do whatever you want honey that's
great we're not gonna get anywhere in
life if you live like that you've got to
have some discipline if you know like
you got to have discipline but you've
also got to let yourself live so you've
got to find that fine line that balance
of okay you know what I'm gonna eat my
veggies so I'm gonna eat my salad I'm
gonna eat my sweet potatoes I'm gonna do
all that I'm gonna drink all my water
and then tonight I'm gonna eat my donut
or my ice cream or whatever you want I'm
gonna enjoy it it's making sure you're
getting in some cardio in your workout I
hated cardio for so long honestly cardio
will make the biggest difference in your
workout now I'm not saying you have to
do a lot of cardio I hate to run I hate
to run so what I do is I will walk
completely all the way up I'll do like
the uphill on the treadmill as far as up
as it goes and I will like fast walk and
I will do that for like literally ten
minutes and then at the end I will run
for three minutes
that is try it I know a lot people hate
cardio I hate cardio what you got to do
it which leads me to my next point which
is workout the way that works for you
what am i doing now some people love to
workout at home and they hate going to
the gym so then if you want to do that
workout at home some people hate going
to the gym but they'll go to the gym and
they won't really want to workout and
they'll be nervous so then don't do that
do what works for you I have to go to
the gym because I know myself that if I
say I'm gonna workout at home
I'm not going to do it I will roll out
that mat I will lay down to do a crunch
and I will turn on Vampire Diaries and I
will lay on the floor for the next hour
there is a third I just don't do it I
know myself that if I say I'm gonna
workout at home it does not happen so I
need to go to a gym I need to be
surrounded by people and I need to have
people around me to feel motivated so do
what works for you listen to yourself
know yourself and last but not least is
trying to be a little bit more active in
your day to day lifestyle already will
make a huge difference no and I do not
take the elevator anymore we live on the
fifth floor and we go up and down the
stairs whenever we need to go outside
and walk the dogs that's good for the
dogs it's good for us actually you have
to carry Roo down the stairs but if
you're still taking the stairs instead
of the elevator we go on longer walks
with the dogs which is again good for
the dogs good for us or we walk to do
stuff for example we live in a pretty
walkable area we could walk five minutes
to get our coffee or drive a minute and
sometimes we like to make sure we walk
and get our coffee if we want to go to
Starbucks so we walk to a bookstore or
we walk to all the different restaurants
around here getting just a little bit
more active in your lifestyle can also
make a huge change so I hope this video
