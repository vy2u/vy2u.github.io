you are new to my channel real quick
before we get started I do have a big
back-to-school giveaway going on the
block back to school supplies so anyone
from middle school college so check that
out in the description box when you're
done watching this if you'd like to
enter and also let's I guess that's kind
of it yeah so today's video is kind of
low up for back-to-school this works
from any age high school college is like
my main audience so that's largely gonna
focus on it kind of works for everyone
um I graduated college last year and I
feel like I definitely learned a lot
through my time in high school middle
school college and I thought I would
just share some my tips for you guys I
definitely was not someone who had a
glow up in high school and not meaning
like I just didn't care about my
appearance I didn't take time out of my
parent I'll be on it was a very sad high
school Kip high schooler I was very
unhappy for my shirt just keep like open
it up hello I was a very unhappy sad
person I think during high school I
always have hair or something going on I
think a lot of times I thought back then
that my happiness was controlled by
everyone else like if people like me if
people are nice to me and let's be
serious let's be real honest here that
is not the case your happiness is
dependent on you it's your attitude your
confidence level how you feel about
yourself and how you treat other people
that is going to contribute a lot more
to how you feel about yourself so I
thought overall I would give you some
tips and tricks tips and tricks that I
wish I had followed more closely when I
was younger or that I use now and stuff
so yeah hopefully this helps you guys
and let's get started number one might
be the most typical thing you put your
card from every single video but that is
to be confident and I'm not someone
who's just gonna make all the because it
allows yourself a move on you guys so
I'm not like that I'm going to tell you
the real deal like it's like a serious
thing like it's honestly like I know
it's harder it's not it sounds harder
than it is or it sounds easier than is
one of those I don't know but you have
to love yourself and become fit first
for everything and I wish I'd learned
that younger because I literally was
always so happy thinking old no one else
likes me or like they don't think I'm
pretty so I can't be
how it works you know like if you think
you're beautiful if you think you're
confident if you think you're nice and
you are those things be what you want to
be you are whoever you want to be you
are gorgeous you are hot you are you are
awesome you're strong you're independent
you just have to know those things about
yourself because the thing about high
school middle school college every age
so now is a lot of people are mean to
people because they are insecure so just
because someone doesn't think
certificate someone tells you or makes
you feel unworthy doesn't mean you're
unworthy it means that person has some
kind of insecurity and trying to make
themselves feel better they you know may
try to make you feel bad to make
themselves feel better which is shitty
on their part let's be serious
but you can't let those things affect
you I know everyone's situation is
different and trust me before you leave
comments like you don't know what my
life is like like my life is so hard
yada yada my life was really hard
I do planned and I could draw my life
eventually but I did have any really
crappy I'll be honest I didn't have the
best high school middle school
experience I had very little friends and
I've actually since I've been on YouTube
had like ten girls reach out to me
apologize to me because now they know
that I'm on social media they know how
mean they were to me so I know what it's
like for girls we mean I know what
that's like so don't think I don't know
I do know but just know you've got to
hold your head high you got to be
confident when you're mom telling it's
because they're jealous it's true you
know it is absolutely true
so if you have to stand in the mirror
every single day and tell yourself how
beautiful you are do that put post-it
notes all over your mirror with like
positive things about yourself tell
yourself every morning before school
three things you love about yourself
tell yourself those things at night and
so on I promise even if you don't feel
like it's true if you keep repeating it
before you know you're going to be like
oh my gosh that's totally true I am
beautiful oh my gosh I am small smart oh
my gosh I am independent you know and
you'll start to realize how true those
things are because you are you are
beautiful strong smart independent
awesome kind friendly hilarious
everything you want to be if you are
already chose things number two this is
a really good tip for me because I look
it was a good tip which I'm followed is
to plan out your outfit I know that
sounds really simple but I would
literally wake up and be like girl I
don't feel like getting ready
I'm going to school and mockingjays I
would go to school I would like wake up
in slug pants and a t-shirt and I would
sometimes go to school in that
sweatpants and also it pants that
t-shirt now I'm not saying there's
anything wrong with that but if you were
trying to make yourself feel better and
you like glowing up snaps then you've
got to put some different clothes on
girl um you know plan out your outfit so
it's easier to grab something and go I
actually like to plan out like five
outfits in advance I could you have a
whole life hack for like getting ready
that would make you if you guys would
like that for back to school let me know
in the comments and the next one is
taking care of your skin as best as you
can now I still have acne so I know acne
is stressful so just make sure to take
care of your skin as best as you can
I'm talking about like you think say
washing off your makeup every night
exfoliating every few days moisturizing
every morning if you have a bad
under-eye circles trying to under eye
cream any of those things will really
make your skin look more refreshed
glowing radiant and healthy which is up
also having good hygiene is very
important I'm not going to lie I went to
school a few times not very hygienic we
all have those days we just don't want
to shower and like that's not that's not
good so make sure you have good hygiene
nobody wants to smell your vo how make
sure Tom deodorant a little we can do a
spritz of like a light perfume take
showers invest in some dry shampoo go
with your someone who doesn't like to
wash her hair every day I wash my hair
like every two days also I skip like two
days in between because of my red hair
and I think skipping days with hair
washing is great so it's best to some
dry shampoo you can get two one I think
the dumb one or the small one is like a
dollar at Walmart and that changed
changes like my anyone's life I actually
just don't think we had her chance me
when I was back in high school and that
makes me really upset
maybe we did lie just didn't know about
it I don't remember us having it back
then and that would have changed my life
if we had because I definitely went to
school with some greasy hair every now
and then and looking back now like why
did I do that I don't know when it comes
to hair makeup I would say figure out
the easiest hair and makeup for you now
I do have a 2028 achelous hairstyles for
back-to-school I just put on recently
check that out if he's like 20
hairstyles to do back-to-school all they
took under five minutes so these are 20
hairstyles you can
do in five minutes before school to look
more put together like you took time to
do something in your hair will be like
people figure out a bit and even if you
don't order your hair at least brush it
maybe a puzzle pipe
I was a really go to school straight out
of bed with my hair like in the same but
I want to sleep in so like maybe at
least brush it and put it back in your
bun if you're going to do that but
honestly if you're wanting to feel
confident I don't want to say that I
want to say like if you want really feel
calm in it like make yourself feel
confident that's okay like take time
when your hair if you want to literally
five minutes to do like a cute braid is
not that long if you really want to do
it I know some people think like that I
get all the commas like and that five
minutes asleep isn't worth it well then
that's that's your life that's okay but
for me I wish I had spent the extra five
minutes in the morning not sleeping so
that I could do my hair and feel a
little bit more confident during the day
and now that I do those things I feel so
much more confident now I make sure to
take time for my hair my outfits and
stuff and if people want to say that's
cheesy it's okay because it makes me
feel good and that's all that matters no
it comes to makeup but I like to do is
set out my exact makeup the night before
some tips as if you are and you know
aren't doing a prepare you want to wear
makeup that's something that's okay to
not be mad at that they're just just
care about you but if you are in the age
where you are wearing makeup and you
don't know where to start I would say
concealer if you have you're trying to
cover up acne or under-eye circles they
have a cheap elf concealers like a
dollar and I use that for the longest
time it works great and mascara is
another way to make yourself look a lot
more awake and alive for the day I love
mascara and I used to use be is either
NYC or went wild has one this is like a
purple tube for a dollar that was always
also my go-to like all through high
school in college so that's another
really good one
and that's not leaves what you have all
that stuff is to go out with a great
attitude stand out be yourself I'm
saying walk around with a great power
poles it's proven the power post with
your hands on your hips and stuff it's
going to keep build more confident and
kind of like holding your arms in if
you're going to if you need a morning
coffee every now and then to make
yourself feel good and feel confident go
grab yourself a morning coffee be a good
mood jana jam out to music before you go
to school tell yourself how awesome you
are look in there and be like girl you
look so good and then go to school and
don't be afraid to stand out be yourself
stand up for yourself love yourself all
those good things little things matter
