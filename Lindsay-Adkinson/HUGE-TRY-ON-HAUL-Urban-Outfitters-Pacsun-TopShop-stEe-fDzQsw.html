also got something to slow down
thank you as a whole to try alcohol I
think it's going to be a part 1 in a
part 2 I'm gonna let you guys decide but
say it's a part 1 for sure just going to
all my facts and stuff I bought in a few
accessories and if you want to see a
part - let me know down below I do have
a bunch of new swimsuit in Fitness
self-images a fitness hole plus a try on
swimsuits the only reason I might not do
it I was a little nervous is because it
is January and compete will might be
like swimsuit in January but I don't
want to see as you can be honest let me
know in the comments below
Park - all yes or no I say yes I might
do it anyways but okay anyways I feel
like it's our insolence video isn't
extremely long first half of stuff from
where all I found them on Instagram and
he has like a lot of followers it's a
really cute stuff and so I bought from
stirrup first thing I just really cute
leather miniskirt I've already worn this
a million times and it's super duper
cute got buttons all the way down and up
the frames also that this really pretty
all the top is a super SuperDuper
cropped crop top it's got really pretty
like flowy
belfry's I've actually been carrying
this with that skirt as well I also got
a pair of jeans that I could wear them
right now but we know to be showing you
on screen they're just black skinny
jeans there's a little bit of like Oh
acid washes like cuts on the knees I
love them I have an obsessive ever since
I put them on probably my new go-to
their jeans so yeah we got we're all I
love you
next I went to topic I wanna be serious
a girl is cheap a s
I never really leave the under 30 or
under 50 section because specific like
it should get to things there but like
this and both
fail any everything I did mom say
elephant okay so I got a pair of the
Joanie jeans I've always seen these on
tons of youtubers a fairly last really
really long time and they're really good
quality so got myself a pair doesn't
really casual height not casual kaitos
yes really simple high waisted a really
light wash jeans there's no rips of it
or no hold just because I realized I
don't want a pair of denim jeans that
holes move so I thought it was time I
was they got Gotham Topshop also on sale
this was $15 it's really really cute and
I'm sure look a denim jacket I'll
probably wear ads like a jacket instead
of a shirt maybe you'll be both you know
I know could get crazy Jenny we like to
express also got a lot of things on bill
they were having some crazy good sales
like girl seriously I didn't know they
have a just whole rack of like
everything it's like 50% off actors army
been marked down don't got some good fun
so first I got a really really cute like
button down strike sure I really don't
ever wear so like this but I just had a
vision with the pants I'm wearing now I
had a vision of this with a black black
and you like a tank top I don't know all
right I got it
I also has a huge cozy comfy sweater I
actually got this in a medium which I'm
usually like a small layer but I got
this little bit oversized and I want to
wear it like with a cup a little bit
lower with a cool like bando or bralette
I got this because it just looks so soft
like a blanket oh my gosh it's so comfy
and then I also got a really pretty
Thomas is another like green so like an
emerald color it's not really all if
it's also got be choker and the cutout
and long sleeves a little flowy at the
bottom a roofie rooster wants to join
Commission age the last thing I got from
Express with this really pretty black
top - they're really simple black
sweater to be honest when we move it
from Ohio to LA I didn't think out eight
long sleeves because I talk about Halle
lays really warm and I got in here I'm
like this it's definitely warmer than
Ohio but I still need some sweater so
what I'm adding darks like a simple
black Fleur doesn't kind of throw on
with anything that was why I don't shop
with touch charlotte russe i don't know
why i justed
i didn't really know what they had in
there but now that I've gone there and
to use like how I'm in extended to
something
now cute it is I will be going back so
this is originally $15.99 done on sale
for five bucks really cute like pan a
crop top is really cute cut off on the
side I decide to you twice and like
under two seconds oh my gosh that little
wrap top crop top also I was like cut
out on the side I don't know hey I got
this black cropped up as well
I don't know about the sleeve it has
really weird shoulders with my shoulders
are really short you know it's interior
is not very long on me so it strap
aren't adjustable in there long like
this usually it won't fit me use it or
like hang down too low
but oh no I didn't try it on that's I'm
lazy so we'll see hopefully if it is not
I just make anything for Faldo and then
from Charlie Rhodes as well
these are 1699 and I'm gonna have to
exchange them or something these are a
size small and I thought they were gonna
fit me I don't know I thought they were
going to fit me and then I realized I
couldn't fit them over my my thighs and
my butt or anything I don't know I I
guess I probably think they have a
medium there I guess not to go back
exchange them but you guys should have
seen me trying to put this on for a
whopping dollar ninety-nine I did get
this black floral like banjo crop top I
guess this is really funky really
probably that funky but it's really cool
and really colorful watch it like it
could be like really funky I honestly
have no idea what I was thinking when I
bought this so this is also L are 99 it
is a Buddhist palm again nobody's
calling my buffalo under from Atlanta
but I hopefully help this body - I know
what I was thinking I bought they just
got some weird stuff going on it's got a
call all your shoulders got cut out on
your back it's gotta cut out somewhere
else and then it buckles underneath but
it was a dollar ninety-nine so I thought
it might be cool I don't know we're
going to find out so I went to Urban
Outfitters and this was a sign this fund
adventure because while my card was
declined twice and I was excluding
they're blaming the guy this is with a
guy like I was putting my car into
machine before it was like going through
you Tony pulls out look no no no no for
MasterCard you do it differently you
slide if you put it in backwards I'm
like no no they're not making this up I
was like nah they hope to do so he's
like don't bleep let me try it sweets
what you split
Oh cards three times backwards and they
almost have my car keys work to the same
declines and like what you do I'm gonna
have to call the bank no like yeah he
hasn't been some suspicious activity
going on out there you'll hear carbon
through a few times like to think it was
a not to do it
so yeah but my card is fine now but
anyways that was embarrassing because
they're all looking at me like are you
gonna buy this or not
no but Noah can you help so her
manometers expensive as always but cute
always I always I always shop the sales
I don't I never leave the sales rack of
any store because she's besides I am so
cheap but I really like this dress so
this is they're really pretty like baby
blue and white dress look like a cone
with a snakeskin pattern up close I
don't quite know is like a polka dami
thing but it's really pretty super flowy
at the bottom so I don't want any flowy
things and I'm getting into that right
now this was originally a hint 69 and I
got on so 420 so I thought it could be
cute though
I also got a bralette because I realized
I don't own a black bra let enough weird
so I bought a black one really pretty
simple lady I liked it it was $20 not
too bad so that was not on sale on
different ones I would have been happier
busking and I also got a cardigan or was
a sweater just because like I said it is
chilly in LA and I have tons of pain
tops and t-shirts my bra and row and
indeed find one other staying for Urban
Outfitters
no one knows when stop so I did
finally queue pair of khaki pants and I
was going to show you but after walking
around the arts district in these khaki
pants for a good hour we get back home
and I was like oh my god you're going to
be so pissed I was likewise like you sat
in dog poop before we left the house so
there is a brown brows real poop stain
on my side the entire time to walk
around we're just fine that's why it's
like it's a favorite thing we will be
with guys creating the whole roll the
Charlie what on there but dokku dog poop
so yeah we also went to the H&amp;amp;M this one
is great
great
saving from a because one eye not soft
the time when I went come oculus because
I marked already wearing them I lose
every pair soft so I ever own I will go
through all these beliefs and not know
where they're at but I got some soft and
I also got these two okay are you hoping
already or some tags off of them because
I wore them today if you if you're
watching this and this your watch is the
day it comes out go to Asian in because
their shoes were on sale for $10 my copy
is a nation in its prettiest quality I
think these are originally for need I
got them on sale for $10 and also
information if I got this really cute
dress it's actually like really edgy and
fun and then I went to pack size and it
was really happy I did because they were
having the boot off sale and the blue
dog sale it means a girl's happy because
if you don't know the blue dog sales you
buy one thing get two things for free so
the thing is I cough is blew up sales

please step off I sweep Rios up that
black ball anything needed some black
jeans and then I also got this cute
little were these klunkins body suits

neck and it's cheetah print which I know
I like cheetah print

have on very similar like this that I've
worn a million times and videos like a
blue and pink one like highlighted one
