because he has an internship a few days
of the week so with LA traffic and how
it really his internship is he usually
is up pretty early gives me a nice
little juice one cheek it is off for the
day now I usually wake up from rooster
give me kisses he is super cute and the
mornings always giving me lots of love
ins and basically telling me hey it's
time to get out and can't use dating but
honestly with a cute puffle you miss how
could anyone complain or ever wake up in
a bad mood now I stretch and wake up
first thing I always do is reach over
for my water that way I make sure I've
already drink a good bit of water for
the day I chug chug chug chug chug as
much as possible or sometimes just sip
sip when I'm on camera and then I will
pull out my find your happy daily mantra
book and this is when I do my morning
meditation I read one page a day I read
it and I asked myself the question that
repeat the mantras and then I will do a
meditation you look like a video all
about meditation I could do that but I
can also link a few videos down below
giving me - let me know in the comments
what you want - what you want but when
occasion is great if you deal with
anxiety stress or just just to do in
general really calms my mind focuses me
on my goals for the day and between any
great mood
now this why it is a cute picture a
wrister because by the time I was done
he was already ready to go back to bed
he was just so awake like two seconds
ago and then since I don't know him I
honestly spend like every moment
together so when he does go to his
internship I usually send him a really
nice good-morning text just because I
already miss him
um yeah cheesy but it's a day and I'll
time to get up and brush my teeth
because nobody wants to smell my breath
in the morning I promise and now it's
time to grab jackets and shoes and
definitely some plugs devices because
nobody wants to see my face in the
morning either and take rooster out for
his morning walk which by the way is
very new at his leash so it still takes
a few tries of getting out the door and
everything but he's doing pretty well
and then I always come back in with my
coffee well not always depending on if I
want to splurge for myself there is a
coffee and tea room just below my
apartment so this morning I got myself a
London Fog I had become super obsessed
with some rice recently there's some
yummy like Suzy so yummy and then after
I see speed restore his breakfast it is
time to set the mood with a candle no
miss Q thinks I'm pretty much only like
this because I was sowing but it's time
to feed myself my own breakfast this
morning I decided to do a snowy Bowl
just because while I look good on camera
and they're pretty delicious so I just
add some yogurt some frozen fruit some
peanut butter and a whole banana and
then I blended that up super super yummy
sometimes I just like to use a frozen
banana and it makes it a little bit more
like açaí Bowl texture but this
morning I didn't have a frozen banana so
this will work and then after I blend it
all up I will top it with granola and
coconut seriously so yummy
now time for me to hit the gym so
usually I will go to the gym 3 to 4
mornings out of the week let me know in
the comments if you'd like to see my
fitness routine I could do that really
soon and one thing I've been loving to
do as a gym is using the bike I feel
like it's actually really fun okay and
then I get home and immediately hop in
the shower this girl is thank you
nobody wants to be around that and then
when I'm done it is time going to get
ready for the day funky glad to meet me
I think you should happy back to me tell
you all you got to meet me I think you
should how do you package now here's
just a quick overview of my outfit and
my makeup I'm obviously not going to
spend all the time telling you
everything because I'm dropping out a
makeup artist however if you look like
if you make an updated makeup routine
maybe I do that I don't know I'm not
like good at it but here's just
everything I've pretty much used every
morning sometimes I'll change it up like
with my eye shadow that's pretty much
all I really change up but this is
pretty much all I do every single
morning or when I'm going summer
obviously if I'm not leaving the house
girls not putting any makeup on but
today I did have a few things to do some
meetings and stuff so yeah
then I'll finish off any of my emails or
you need to do on the computer real
quick and then it's time for you get
