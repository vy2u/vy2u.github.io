I'm sleepy at about this your day so
much not really nice and I'm really
shocked
hey guys and welcome back to my channel
or welcome if you are new today's video
is going to be all about how I turned my
life around
I feel like gosh that this is a topic to
start off with I know I've mentioned
many times I'm gonna start putting more
positive inspiration content out there
and I feel like this is a good one
I feel I've got a few more but I think
this is a good one to preface with
before I started doing like my draw my
life stuff my gosh you guys are gonna
get the cutest view if he stays back
there oh my god so I grew up in a life
filled with I hate the term abuse I hate
using that word but I feel like it is
the proper word to use the proper term
to use and I've just gotta come to terms
with that eventually so I grew up in a
life filled with physical abuse mental
abuse verbal abuse and even sexual abuse
I dealt with a lot of neglect I dealt
with a lot of hardships being put on me
and those things can put a lot of hurt
on people and thing is a lot of people
deal with really bad things all the time
and it really can take a toll on your
mental your mental health your
well-being your spirit your soul your
motivation and for a long time that it
did for me I ended up leaving high
school early then I decided I got a
little bit of dry for like 20 minutes I
guess and decided I wanted to go to
college and then I dropped out of
college I was always self sabotaging I
never had good friendships or good
relationships because if I found a good
friendship or good relationship it's
like I didn't believe it was true so I
would do whatever it took to like in
that friendship or make it end or I just
did terrible things I said mean things I
just did bad things to end friendships
and in relationships
I stayed in toxic and bad relationships
so easily like I had so many bad
boyfriends out of relationships I just I
don't know like if a friend treated me
like crap I stayed around that friend
but if uh you know a friend that was
really really nice to me I didn't think
it was real I thought it was fake and I
would do whatever it took to push him
away I deal with a lot of trying to
self-medicate my pain I dealt with a lot
of self-harm
I did a lot of really bad
stuff I put myself in worse situations
and I you know hurt myself along the way
I'm sure I hurt other people along the
way I didn't try at life I had no
motivation no goals there were times
when I just wanted to literally kill
myself I don't know that's just how my
mind had become it was very toxic sick I
guess the word sick is a good word for
it was very very unhealthy
I actually remember exactly when my life
took a little bit of a change I was
living in a trailer with a bunch of
roommates so I didn't really know what I
needed to do or what I was gonna do with
my life and what it was gonna come next
I knew that I had to make a move second
I didn't make a move a week later was
gonna go by now with me back to where I
was or back where I had began and not
moved at all so that very following
Monday I it just happened to be right
before the next school semester I went
to the college I had initially dropped
out of and I rien rolled back into
college and I went back to the initial
degree that I was gonna go before but I
went so I went back to college and I
within that same week I ended the
relationship I was in I moved out of
that trailer moved back home with some
family members and I decided it was time
to get the ball rolling it was almost
like because I was willing I was willing
to give myself another chance
go into things kept happening I made new
friendships and relationships good and
bad I was introduced to the movie the
secret and that is such a life-changing
movie if you haven't seen the secret you
need to watch it it's on Netflix
I watched the secret I started reading
so many self-help books and I found that
the more I was willing the more that I
was open to change the more that I was
accepting accepting of my life and who I
was the more good things kept happening
so there all these books and through
everything I was learning the first
thing I realized that I need to do was
work on my mind my mind was the biggest
problem in my life
yes I had shitty situations as a kid yes
I had some bad things that had happened
to me it but I realized the past was
over I never had to go back there but I
had just kept reliving it so I had to
realize I have to get out of that past
and get in the present and I found the
best way to do that was to meditate when
you meditate it
you're just clearing your mind you're
coming to a a quiet state and it's like
all of the crazy thoughts you may be
having the negative thoughts the sadness
the anxiousness like the the fear-based
thoughts they kind of just subside for a
minute and it's just you your true self
that says okay you're okay you've got
this let's take a breather and let's do
it again
so I also began to forgive myself and
forgive everyone around me whether or
not they wanted to be forgiven or not if
I would think about bad things that
would happen that had happened to me I
was like okay I forgave them I forgive
them it's over with and that is just
like a weight off your shoulder and even
more so forgiving yourself for the way I
had been the way I treated myself the
way I treated others I would tell myself
almost every morning okay I I know that
you thought that telling yourself that
you were not good enough or that you
were stupid or that you can't do this I
know you thought you were doing
something good I know you thought you
were in the right place but you are not
so I don't need you to do those things
anymore but I forgive you for the way
you treated yourself and I started
replacing those thoughts with positive
things every day I would look in the
mirror and tell myself how much I love
myself whether or not I believed it I
just kept saying it every day I would I
still to this day tell myself three
things I'm grateful for every single day
and then I don't know if you guys know
much about the Avalon contest I had
entered but Oh having hiccups there
happened to be a contest right at the
end of when I was finishing college
where about two hours away from my
childhood home in a much bigger city I
lived in a very small town they were
giving away a free apartment for an
entire year and I saw the contest and I
knew I was supposed to enter in starting
at day one when I entered I told myself
every day I am winning this contest this
is mine and I made it so in my mind I
thought I already had it that I had that
contest it was my apartment for the year
I won it from close my eyes I visualized
myself like waking up there in the
morning I visualized what my furniture
would look like I visualized what it
would be like living there every single
day
about six months later I wanted that
contest and I moved into an apartment
that I had for free for an entire year
now I know everyone is not going to get
a free apartment for the year or find an
opportunity like that but there are
opportunities everywhere you just have
to open your mind change your mindset
and start looking for them because if I
hadn't been so trying to be so positive
and always listening to podcasts and
always reading self-help books I
wouldn't have found the contest
I wouldn't have won the contest old
Lindsey back then would not have won
that contest so from that right before
it ran around before that year started
the contest I had started my youtube
channel I finished college and I was
like you know what I think this is what
I want to do I wasn't sure exactly what
I wanted to do on my channel I know it
took me a few years for that but I knew
I wanted a voice I wanted a way to talk
to people about my life and experiences
and how you can change your life so I
started a YouTube channel right before
the contest and by the end of the next
year I had a hundred thousand
subscribers I still remember opening up
that hundred thousand plackets over
there and sobbing ever I was screaming
crying I was so happy now I meant three
hundred and thirty thousand subscribers
and I make enough to happily live off of
and that's not the point the point is I
live every day of my life knowing that
I'm putting out stuff that I'm proud of
and doing things that I'm proud of and
doing things that make me feel good and
every day I'm accomplishing new things
just recently I accomplished a new hard
task which was standing up for myself
against some family members that had not
treated me well my entire life and I
finally had to say listen no more and I
still do these things for myself every
day and I know I'm gonna keep growing on
here I know I'm gonna do more things a
few months ago you might have noticed
they switch in my channel I used to put
up like what did I put up content for no
a lot of younger content which is okay
but I knew it wasn't what I wanted to do
and I asked myself to remember why did I
start this why did I start my channel
and it is to empower females and not
just females anyone out there needs a
empowerment boost and I know I'm doing
that you know this video alone was a big
step for me knowing like okay I keep
talking about making
videos let's make one so I guess the
point of this is I changed my life
around simply by telling myself I
deserve better than I'm getting myself I
am in control of my life I have the
power to change anything and my
circumstances in my life I just have to
get started I have to do something so I
promise you whatever situation you are
in right now
you can take the first step to changing
your life as well I did it and you may
think I had extremely waiting
circumstances like the free apartment
but you don't understand the life that I
came from and I will make it draw my
life but I promise you if I can get
through what I got through if I can get
through all the things I got through um
you can get through anything you you
want to get through I promise you you
are strong you are you've got to be
hungry for life you know just find a
hunger find what makes you happy get
hungry for it that's like my favorite
term I love Les Brown if you have never
watched this up the kids like positivity
motivation speaks I love them get hungry
for your life and know that life isn't
defined by 30 happy your 30 happiest
moments life is defined by making sure
every single day is happy so find what
you want to find your Drive find your
motivation work towards that keep going
keep growing start meditating watch the
secret read some self-help books and
yeah you never know where your life
could be a hundred days from now two
weeks from now a year from now you know
I never thought what four or five years
ago to Pete that I'd be where I am and I
cannot wait to see where I am next year
the year from that five years from now
ten years from now because I know I'm
not gonna stop and that's what you have
