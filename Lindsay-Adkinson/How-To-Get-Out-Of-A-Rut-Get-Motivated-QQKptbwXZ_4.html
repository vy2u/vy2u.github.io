there but I'm not even gonna move to fix
it good morning I am currently about to
go and hang out with some friends we're
gonna go take some photos and get
breakfast first which is why I didn't
eat in this video so far cuz we're
getting breakfast I'm so hungry
but I wanted to sit down and talk to you
guys really quick before they get here
hopefully they're not here to wait cuz I
want to film this video to actually go
up today so when you're watching this I
filmed this this morning
it is currently like 9:00 a.m. I was in
a really bad rut or a really bad place
for about a week and I was really down
on myself hard on myself I was being
mean to myself I didn't think I was
worth anything and I know that's so
often a lot of people feel like that
it's very normal but a lot of people
don't talk about it cuz nobody wants to
put their bad days on their Instagram
feed or their YouTube channel or you
know and so I wanted to talk about it
because it's real life I've had a bad
few days you know and that's not the end
of the world it is normal but I'm out of
it I was in those bad few days one I was
about to start my period that always
makes me extra emotional and also I've
had some really bad stuff going on with
my family me and my mom are in a really
bad place like we're not we've never
really been super close but she's always
still been my mom and now it just were
even in a worse place you know I've also
been stressed about YouTube and the
wedding I've got my wedding coming up
and there's so much to do and I lately
have just been all over the place and I
think I just needed to let myself have
those few bad days to feel it and then
to move on it is so okay to have bad
days or even about a week but here's the
thing you can have a temper tantrum you
can kick and scream and be mean to
yourself and yell and scream into your
pillow but you can also wake up the very
next morning and be a whole new happy
kick-ass person by breakfast time I
stole that line from Oprah I wanted to
tell you
different things I did to get myself out
of that ride so I started off by talking
about it a lot
well I am a talker I'm a feeler I'm a
crier I'm a screamer when I'm upset and
I just talked
especially don't know it mayn't only
really didn't know I just sat down and
he is so wonderful he lets me just vent
and tell him all how I'm feeling and
usually when you talk to someone by the
end you're like oh my gosh I feel 400
times better already just because you
get it off your chest and you talk to
someone you kind of get a lot more
mental clarity about what's really going
on it wasn't necessarily that I'm
stressed about the wedding you know I'm
excited for the wedding it's not
necessarily that I'm stressed about this
or that it's just that I was getting
overwhelmed you know and I have to kind
of realize that there are things in my
life I cannot control and so there's no
I can't just sit here and stressed about
it 24/7 there's only so much you can do
as a human for other people or for other
situations and I also then made sure I
was taking care of myself my mental
health my overall health when you get in
a rut it's very easy to stop taking your
vitamins eating healthy going to the gym
sleeping properly put my phone away for
a full day I just didn't look at my
phone actually gave it to no one he was
like just give it to me he'll just
simple things like that making sure I
was taking care of me as well I also
decided to listen to some healthy
podcast I love Oprah super soul it's
probably the only one I really listen to
for that kind of stuff I love every
single one she puts out I went to the
library mylas being so cute my love come
on up come on I went to the library and
got some self-help books teacher I
started meditating again I had really
gotten out of meditating for Yanis of
the past few weeks with so much going on
and it really just shows me how much
meditating can change my life change
your life because when I am NOT
meditating my mind I am a very anxious
stressed over thinking person so when
I'm meditating it just clears my mind
enough where I realize okay all these
thoughts in my head right now are just
thoughts it's not me
I can change my thoughts think about
something new and then I feel better
another thing I like to do is start
thinking of the little steps versus the
big picture which is kind of opposite
what a lot of people think I think a lot
of people like to say like look at the
big picture but sometimes when you're
overwhelmed in life and you have so much
going on sometimes a big picture can
stress you out sometimes thinking about
okay well within two months I have to
get married do this do that do this so
that you know I started to get
overwhelmed so I started taking it step
by step like today all I have to do is
go and get my dress fitted tomorrow all
I need to do is film a video and edit
that video day number three all I have
to do is this and this instead of
thinking I have so much to do this week
just take it step by step and realize
every time you get one thing done it's
crossed off and you feel so much better
honestly getting it over getting down on
yourself and being sad it's just so it's
so normal that you just have to also
remind yourself that what you're feeling
is normal it's normal to have emotions
life is not all light love and rain
rainbows and unicorns I wish it was
there's people who like to preach that
it is but it's not life happens I am a
genuinely happy person I am happy most
days but I have bad days I have bad
weeks everyone does and accepting that
and realizing that you can be proactive
about it is a huge step it's also really
good if you're in a rut to get away from
your negative space say you're really
negative in your bedroom get out of that
bedroom if your keep thinking about it
when you're like lonesome in your
bedroom get out of there for a while go
hang out in your living room go outside
go to a movie go take a walk you know do
something to get away from that space
and that also can give you a lot of
clarity so many different things you can
do to get out of a bad mental space
basically you want to do everything that
keeps you from just sitting there and
thinking about it you just want to get
out of that place and be present in your
life you and I both but you and I both
are worthy we are beautiful we are sexy
we are strong we are smart we are valued
we are loved we are talented and we are
just as good as anyone else on this
planet we are just as good as them we
are also worthy and so talented and we
all have our own unique nets you know we
we are all so good you know it's so
weird that we compare ourselves to other
people are there situations when we were
all created with our own path our
own purpose our own uniqueness so why
compare yourself to someone else you
know we all have our own journey to be
on and that's such a beautiful thing
when you really think about it so and
know that even when you have bad days
that could be part of your plan maybe
you needed that bad day for some mental
clarity maybe you needed that bad day to
bring about some thoughts you didn't
know that you had or to deal with some
issues so it's ok as long as you don't
let it take over your life and you get
over it and you move on and you know
that you are a badass human being and
you are ready to take on the next day
