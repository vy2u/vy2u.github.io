channel or welcome if you are new
today's video is going to be a fashion
tax video but this is going to be like a
fashion hacks on how to look expensive
so basically I'm gonna be telling you
all of my tips and tricks to look to
your most put together expensive
great-grand self even if you are
shopping on a budget now make sure if
you enjoy these fashion act if you'd
like to see more of them to go ahead and
hit that thumbs up button subscribe so
you never miss any more of my uploads
and let's get started number one is
going to be your neutrals I feel like
anything that is neutral color tend to
look a lot more expensive than something
that is brightly colored obviously I'm
wearing a pink shirt right now but I'm
just saying well if it comes to maybe
you're buying a jacket you're looking
for an affordable jacket that looks
really nice look for one that is a
neutral color like a grey a brown black
white instead of something maybe that's
like hot pink or a bright color orange
yellow something like that definitely do
you think that neutral colors do tend to
look a lot more expensive and things
that are bright loud colors especially
when they are more affordable pieces
number two are your basics you cannot
have as too many basics now I love
having tons of all different colors
especially neutrals tank tops plain
shirts things like that just because you
can't really distinguish whether or not
they are cheaply made or expensively
made you can't really tell and the thing
is basics are so easy to dress up dress
down look casual make them work for any
styles whatever look you're going to
basics are the basic or beginning of any
of those outfits so I think it's just so
easy to take a basic tank top and some
jeans throw in a Jack in some jewelry
and you look very put together and very
nicely dressed
next is making sure that you're wearing
a put together nice looking shoes shoes
can make or break your outfit if you're
wearing some cute jeans a tank top in
that jacket but you throw on some like
torn up worn up you know vans that
you've had since sixth grade and they're
super muddy then yeah you might not look
as put together but you can easily find
some affordable really nice looking
shoes I buy tons of shoes from vsw at a
very discounted price I also buy tons of
shoes at
margit I bet you wouldn't guess that the
wedges that I wear and all of my photos
I actually got from Target for like
$14.99 on sale I also have a really cute
pair of black slip-on booties that I got
also for like 25 or 29 at DSW on sale as
well oh and also my mules that I've been
wearing my slip on mules I've been
wearing so much lately I also got those
on sale at DSW I think those were like
30 bucks so all three of those were very
affordable shoes they also look really
nice and they helped my outfit look even
better and more put together
number four is your material quality now
I'm someone I feel like I can feel
something I can kind of tell if it's
good quality or bad quality if it's
falling apart so when you're buying
something at a store take the time to
look at it even if it is very
inexpensive you plan to wear it a couple
of times look at the stitching look if
it's falling apart look and see if
there's any tears or rips in it number
five is your jewelry and your
accessories that can also change an
outfit I definitely like to have a good
bit of jewelry accessories on hand I
have so much jewelry and I don't have
expensive jewelry I buy a ton of my
jewelry at forever 21 I get a lot of
stuff off Etsy I've gotten a lot of
jewelry like Tilly's anything like that
that has like cute affordable jewelry I
just buy a good bit of it and I have it
on hand so I can accessorize any outfit
because just like I said with the basics
jeans and a tank top throw on it really
some really cute jewelry and your outfit
has been taken to another level my next
tip or hack is if you are going to buy
something expensive if you're going to
splurge on something make it count
if I'm going to splurge on an item I'm
not gonna splurge on a shirt that I can
only wear a few times it's really crazy
patterned I'm not gonna splurge on just
something I just learned something that
I'm not gonna wear very often if I want
to splurge on something it's going to be
something I will get a lot of use out of
for example may be a really nice pair of
staple jeans that you can wear with any
outfit or maybe a really nice jacket or
maybe a really nice purse that you can
throw on with every outfit something
like that you don't want to splurge on
items that you are only gonna get a few
times of use out of so make your
splurging count number seven is look for
your dupes and like your knockoffs now
I'm deaf
not saying to go look for a Louis
Vuitton bag knockoff because most likely
that probably will look a little fake
and people will probably know but you
can also if you can definitely find some
really cute Duke items for example this
shirt right here actually got this wrong
website I will link it down below called
Belle Lily and they basically just make
sure to look pretty similar to one that
you will find on every Instagram model
and in every store for very expensive
except this was like a third of the
price
Emma eighth and final one is to invest
in a steamer and in some stain out
definitely don't go around with clothes
that stains on them or wrinkles and is
very easy to get those things out stay
now it's like two bucks a steamer is
like ten dollars and it makes your
clothes look so much better so much more
put together and it makes you look a lot
more expensive in styling okay guys that
