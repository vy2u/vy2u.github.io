or welcome if you are new today's video
is going to be ways to actually lose
weight get in shape and feel healthy now
you guys have been wanting another
fitness video for a very long time
however it was really cold where I live
and I didn't want to film outside and I
have and I like to film my fitness
videos outside so now that it's warmer
and get ready for a lot more like
fitness and health related videos now go
ahead and make sure to give this video a
big thumbs up if you want to see more
fitness videos so that way if this video
gets enough thumbs up I know that I
should keep doing them and maybe I'll do
like two or three a month number one is
going to be your diet know what I
recommend is honestly a plant-based diet
when I used to go to the grocery store I
used to go and buy frozen pizzas
hamburger stuff and gross like bags and
bags of junk food and easy things to
make and now when I go to the grocery
store all I do is I go to the produce
section I stock up on veggies I stock up
on fruits I go and buy some bread some
rice some pasta and that is pretty much
it I also make it some almond milk you
know or so some a few additives but
that's pretty much all I buy to keep in
my house because if it's not here I'm
not gonna eat it you have to retrain
yourself that we eat to live we don't
live to eat now food is great and so
we're like different drinks and stuff
I'm not saying that you should never
treat yourself I think treating yourself
in life is a huge thing
however when we're eating these things
every day it's no longer a treat and it
just becomes part of our lifestyle so
what I like to do is when I'm out and
about with my friends or on a date or
something exciting happens or if it's a
Friday I will go and treat myself to
something I really want or something
like that I'm craving that way it is a
treat but I'm not over indulging on it
number two is cardio get your butt
outside go for a run go for a walk go
for a jog ride your bike dance join a
sport place for with your friends get
outside get active or you can do it
inside honestly you could've danced on
in your living room raise your heart
rate get your blood pump and get your
body moving there's no easy way to do it
honestly but it's fun once you really
start doing it you're gonna be like wow
this is actually fun like dancing around
my living room going for a run it like
clears your mind and gives you like this
awesome Mentos
it's good for you it's good for your
mental health as well as your physical
health something I've been using for my
running and all my cardio lately is
something called sensoria since aria
comes with the full system comes with a
pair of socks two anklets a bra a sports
bra or a t-shirt if you're a guy and
then a heart rate monitor and you wear
all this and it connects through
bluetooth to an app on your phone it's
not just to tell you how fast or how far
you run is also letting you know how
well you run or how well you're doing in
your cardio the app you can track things
like your calories your heart rate your
steps your pace your distance and so
much more just great because you can
track your progress and it also will
save your progress if you want you can
have them email to use and you can even
choose the exact shoes you're wearing
which is really cool because then you
just know it's super customized you can
customize your workout it's just really
great if you want to not just run it but
you want to run well if you want to not
just get the not just do your workout
but get the most out of it number three
is your mind a healthy mind is a healthy
body honestly I am a huge believer in
this if you walk around with negative
thoughts you're comparing yourself to
other people you're not going to see the
results you want to see if you walk
around saying oh my gosh I hurt body's
better than mine oh my gosh I need this
body oh my gosh I hate my body oh my
gosh I hate this about myself then
you're going to keep hating those things
about yourself and you're gonna keep
focusing on what you like about other
people you have to stop doing that and
break that cycle you have to start
thinking about what you already love
about yourself you should love
everything about yourself because it's
yourself love yourself no matter where
you're at and just love yourself your
body is beautiful your body is your body
no matter what body shape you have no
matter your body type no matter how much
you weigh all of that you need should be
looking in the mirror every morning like
oh my gosh I am a hot because that is
going to fuel you way more than anything
else I promise you a healthy mind is the
first step to a healthy body
number four is stop cutting corners or
taking the easy route because those do
not they for the most part they're not
gonna give you the results that you want
all these diet supplements and you know
the 30 day detox is and the juice
cleanses ya some of them can be good for
you I'm not saying that but they're not
gonna give you those oats you want
that's not an instant route for a
healthy lifestyle you've got to make the
change just people don't want to hear
the hard truth but that's just it you've
just got to do the work if you ever hire
a personal trainer
they are never gonna tell you to go buy
a body wrap and a waist trainer and some
detoxes and some pills they're gonna
tell you to eat your fruits and veggies
and go run so do it the right way and I
promise you you're gonna see the right
results so that is honestly all that I
can tell you if you really want a
healthy lifestyle and if you really want
to be feel good about yourself and feel
good on the inside you've got to just
start doing it you've got to make the
change no matter what you're beautiful I
love you I hope you're having a
beautiful day make sure to check out all
