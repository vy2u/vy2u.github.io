welcome with your new today's video is
going to be I copied Jacqueline Hills
Instagram photos now this is a different
video from you don't do it don't tend to
really do challenge type videos but I
thought this one would be fun to do just
because I have cut my hair pretty short
and I had red hair and she used to have
short right here so I thought I would
copy
Jaclyn Hills photos but copy more of her
older photos back when we had similar
hair except I did copy one photo with
when she has like her new her hair but
whatever also if you noticed this pretty
little watch on my arm oh my gosh this
is my new jour watch this is the event
date I think it's like vintage wood and
Rose actually going to be doing a
giveaway with Jordan watches where one
of you guys can't win a watch all you

to enter and also no matter what if you

of the giveaway it will get a $50 like
coupon definitely cute watch definitely
enter the giveaway down below you'll see
me working this all the time now but
let's get started with the video where's
the cameras are you dying your shadow
check to make sure over doing it here's
the street I feel like it's similar
enough I'm gonna set this here up up
hopefully this works please don't fall
okay so we switch sides because the
lighting I'm going to set my camera on
someone's cart hopefully they don't
notice okay so this is the very first
photo that I chose to do of Jaclyn hill
this is an older one but I chose this
photo because I thought it would be an
easier one to do and I wanted to start
off on an easier note rude but I chose
this one because I also have the exact
green jacket that Jaclyn hill has been
seen wearing so I ended up being a
little bit harder than I thought of what
the lighting was not correct it when we
first started doing the photo when we
were turned around the background looked
perfect but the lighting was wrong so we
had to end up turning me around I think
I'm pretty good the jacket looks the
same I had some issues with my dress
because it's shrunk in the dryer either
when I feel like I didn't do the best on
so I think I'll give this one like a 6
up tip number two it was probably one of
my favorites from this entire shoot
thing this is a photo I chose right here
of Jacqueline's
I actually have ended up posting my
version on Instagram already and I
gotten so many comments like oh this
reminds me of Jacqueline hill
oh sometimes and hill vibes going on so
in this one Jackson is like strutting
her stuff major attitude with her car
obviously I don't have a G Wagen I own a
Chevy so it wasn't a declare race on my
end okay vlog camera already died so
we're using my phone but we got all the
stuff we need hopefully no one pulls
into the spot next to us because we have
to have two spots available
but I kind of feel like if it wasn't for
the car that I did pretty well
I took my facial expressions pretty
similar I did my hair the same I didn't
have a black backpack backpack or the
same outfit but I got as close as I
could and grabbed the same like lighter
colored and coffee drink I think I did
pretty good on this one and I liked this
one a lot I posted it and you guys
really seemed to like it so I'm gonna
give myself an 8 out of 10 for this one
okay number three I did not think was
going to end up being number three I
chose this photo of Jackson Hills and we
did not think it was gonna happen
because simply it's a currently snowing
outside in Ohio but we happened the day
that I was filming this we got like like
some 60 was like 55 60 degree weather
and I was like that's pretty cold but
I'm gonna do it right Maddie's
-
so around here at the pool we got in a
little bit of trouble and I guess you're
not supposed to have floaties at the
pool oops vide they're really nice I
said we can do it just today and this is
the nicest pool I've ever seen guys look
at where she lives all right guys we did
it we cheated a little a little bit a
little bit cuz it's because mine has a
hole in the flow and hers is like a has
a bottom so I couldn't get in the waters
I'd do the concrete next to the water
but I think we did it I think we did it
big things to Maddie for letting me use
her pool she's 100 oysters my hair if it
was awesome photos and stuff sold in for
down below we should check her out but
after the next one for this photo I even
got the exact sunglasses I went to the
store and bought some right before this
I bought the float so because I feel
like I put in a lot of effort on this
one
yeah the float may not be perfect yeah I
may not actually be in the water but I'm
gonna give myself a 9 out of 10 for
effort because I think this is pretty
close alright number four is a very fun
one this is one of Jacqueline Chesire
darker hair now and she's outside in her
robe looking major like oh I do not want
to be up on this more Monday morning
it's definitely like a Monday nude photo
I thought this is really funny of
Jacqueline to post definitely shows her
personality not you know taking things
too seriously being able to post this so
it's also be a very fun one to recreate
40 bucks why are rope so expensive
everyone's looking like I'm crazy like a
little neighborhood with lots of greens
the lights really bright so they can
make this work now for my photo I don't
think it's exact I was a little I was a
little hard but I went to the store I
bought a row it was 40 bucks why a robe
so expensive but it is very soft and
I've worn it a lot since oh I'm not mad
anymore at the time I was mad I even I
didn't have the exact slippers either or
like obviously she's wearing Uggs in
this but I did have black slippers I
borrowed Noah's a black headphones and
his laptop I don't even own a laptop now
I think it's pretty close so I even
waited for the wind to blow for my hair
to be in my face like hers however I
realized I thought she was popping a leg
out but it's just the wind is blowing a
little bit more in her photo
so my leg pop is wrong also my laptop
should have been facing more towards the
camera so you can see the Apple on it so
I think on this one I'm gonna give
myself like a six out of ten and number
five last but not least is a photo of
Jacqueline and John I want to recreate
this one so badly just because of the
place right next to our permit I thought
looked pretty similar to the place that
Japanese John took their photo like
raining in their photo it's not raining
in ours our location isn't like exact
but I feel like it's really cute I think
there's gonna be a really good shot so
oh and then I didn't have a black flowy
top what's that with short sleeves but I
thought one pretty similar and I feel
like our outfits are pretty on point for
this one we are umbrella might have been
a little too big compared to theirs I
don't know why we have such a huge
umbrella probably cuz Ohio is nuts when
it rains uh-huh but this one took us a
few tries out there it was really funny
because we were right in between a bunch
of restaurants and all the employees
we're just watching us like press go on
the photo and then run over and we take
a shot so it was really really funny and
I think because of our effort in because
no it wasn't on this one I'm gonna give
it a 9 out of 10 and I will 100% focus
on Instagram don't even care that it's
not raining okay guys so that is it for
