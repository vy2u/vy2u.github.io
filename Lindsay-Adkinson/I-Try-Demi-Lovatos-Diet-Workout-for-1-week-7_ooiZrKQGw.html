happen to be new today's video is going
to be testing out or trying out Demi
Lovato's diet and workout also I do plan
to make this more of a series so if you
have a specific celebrity or like
influencer or someone you want me to
test out their diet and workout let me
know in the comments and I will
hopefully get to all of them one day
now Demi is a major like girl boss boss
babe in general promoting very positive
things self-love mental health awareness
so I was very happy to do her Diane
workout because I am a big fan of hers
it was actually very easy to find the
information for her since she is
currently working with fabletics she has
done so many interviews with women's
health magazine Fitness Magazine
PopSugar fabletics himself she worked
with Skechers and did an interview with
Skechers all about her diet and exercise
and it was pretty consistent through all
of the websites I was like ok this will
be a really easy one to do and I will be
putting all the sources in the
description box if you want to check
those out so when it comes to her diet
the main takeaways is that as no added
sugar no flour no mainly no no like
breads or pastas no dairy and she only
really eats whole natural foods
she is lactose intolerant so there's no
dairy which is great for me as you guys
know I haven't had dairy in over a year
now there were some times when I did eat
me in this but I also did add a few
alternative me it's like tofu I found
some like knockoff bacon and stuff like
that it was still very healthy and it
added some of that in as well another
quick disclaimer for the breakfast part
just because I got so not hate comments
but Kai yep and my Ariana one a lot of
people really didn't like the fact that
I wouldn't eat the oatmeal because all
right I wanted to just be open with you
guys for just a second a little
sidetrack the reason I don't eat oatmeal
isn't just because I don't like oatmeal
it actually does bring up something so
silly but it's not it brings up a lot of
bad things from East that was actually a
turning point in my life it taught me to
kick my ass into gear and go back to
college and work on my dreams and now
I'm here living a fabulous life as a
youtuber because of you guys so don't be
sad that I said that and there had been
a point when I had been so broke
negative in my bank account and the only
food I had in my house was oatmeal
because it was so cheap and there was a
point when I actually ate oatmeal for
every single meal for about
two or three days because that was all I
had that was all I had and I was
literally living paycheck-to-paycheck
waiting for my next check to arrive so
what I did is instead of doing old my
own fruit I did a fruit smoothie and
added outs into the smoothie because
actually what that will do if you blend
out the oats and add milk and add fruit
it's still gonna be basically the same
thing still hate the oatmeal
I just didn't eat it in a bowl all mushy
and you know the way I can't eat it just
I can't do it I can't I'm sorry don't be
mad though in this movie I have an
entire orange a whole banana I don't
know if you can tell but there's three
huge handfuls of spinach like stuffed in
there a little bit of frozen
strawberries some frozen blueberries
somewhere in there and I do like a big
spoonful of these like quick one-minute
whole-grain oats to keep me cool a
little bit of chia seeds and some
alternative milk nothing gonna be a huge
breakfast and these are so yummy
say good morning good morning
hahaha they all just got embarrassed on
camera but I won't tell you why I'll cut
it out I don't even know I haven't but
another smoothie same thing same
ingredients it looks a little bit
prettier this morning
I'm pretty big kale salad with raw
broccoli and then I topped it with a
bunch of tofu and some barbecue sauce I
love barbecue sauce so no one's having a
big heap of mac and cheese in fried
chicken oh but he's got a salad with it
so all good on to her work out this girl
works hard she is a hard-working female
Wow so Demi works out six days a week
with Sundays off and three to four days
a week she does cardio and that's three
to four days a week she does strength
training and toning but when I chant
what I did for this week is three days
out of the week I did cardio two days I
did half an hour running half an hour
walking uphill and one day I just did an
hour on the elliptical when it comes to
her workout I did find an article she
was talking about when she's off tour
she just loved doing you know toning
workout squats
planks crunches all that typical stuff
and adding in weights with Samet so I
did that for one day and then for the
other two I actually found where she did
her exact on tour workout so I did add
that in two days as well so did all
different of her workouts this week
then go to the gym that's not happening
so I think it is crazy I wish you could
really tell how much is coming down it's
like little pieces but it's just pouring
anyways I'm gonna go warm up and I guess
I will work out in flippin
tonight you're wondering who is this
diet and workout good for I will say if
you are a meat-eater this is a good diet
for you
it is very attainable it's very good for
you she still eats tons of carbs she had
so many sweet potatoes I have never
eaten so many sweet potatoes I thought
our eat a lot of sweet potatoes sheets
Dimmie sometimes he eats too sweet
potatoes in a day uh-hum so it
definitely is a very good filling diet
she does treat herself on Sunday so it's
definitely a balanced diet that you can
achieve if you're someone who doesn't
eat meat it may not be for you for me it
probably isn't the diet for me I
probably won't continue this diet but it
is a good easy achievable attainable
diet if you do eat meat now the workout
is for anyone who has an hour a day six
days a week definitely taught me that
the more I'm working out them veterans
gonna my better result I probably will
not stick to six days but I think I will
go and add an extra day or two it
definitely was really great for my
mental state all the cardio as someone
who does deal with depression and
anxiety running that much really really
clears your mind gets you focused makes
you feel really good so that is
something I am gonna stick to I may not
do it six days three or four times a
week but I will be adding in cardio
maybe even even if I just did 20 minutes
every time I go to the gym I'm gonna
stick with it cuz I definitely love that
I did notice that my booty got a little
bit lifted I noticed some sculpting in
my thighs I definitely noticed a more
toned look in my stomach I definitely
think if you were to stick with this a
little bit longer you would see in sane
results because she look at her she's
insane and I do love also this diet is
not about a number on a scale I'm all
for that that's why I don't weigh myself
in any of these videos because fitness
and health is not about a number on a
scale it is not about looking like
someone else is not like look comparing
yourself to demi it is about just
feeling good and feeling just feeling
good it's about feeling good and taking
care of your body so please know that
that is all this is about so hopefully
you enjoyed this hopefully you got some
tips you can take away from it I know
