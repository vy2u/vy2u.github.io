welcome if you are do today's video is a
trial on hole but it's also a little bit
of a review for some Instagram hyped
fashion companies I feel a lot of people
doing this with makeup but I thought why
not do it with fashion because I know
everyone likes to shop at fast Innova
tiger mist lately I think of all over
Instagram and I was like let's check
them out tiger mix I think try to scam
me because let me just let me just for
the beginning I'm on Instagram I wasn't
I was originally planning on doing this
video and I happened to be on Instagram
I saw a tiger miss Instagram story and
they posted if you go on to their
website and sign up for their newsletter
or sign up for their email wish you can
be a 55 zero 50% off and I was like whoa
buddy
now I need to be going to do that 50%
off yeah time to shop so it's because
their stuff on Instagram is the hell of
cute
so what other website excited for
newsletter and nothing happened I was
looking oh maybe it's going to eat ugly
the code or email eat something few
hours later nothing happens and then I
notices something popped up on my screen
a third time that I tried oh no it's
computers that sign up now for 15% off
1/5 I was like no girl you said 50% on
Instagram I'm going to get in 50% off so
I decided to open a cost customer
support I was like hi I'm trying to get
a 50% off code or your website and it's
not working he's like oh wow it's
working for everyone else so I was like
it is he's like yeah it seems like a
fortune for everyone else that we're
getting tons of people with sides on
Instagram so I just wanted to go and
look on their Instagram while talking
this guy and I noticed there was like
tons of people calling on their photos
like hey I never got cold
hey the code didn't work hey I never met
a cold hey the cold is not there honey
is 50% off
now let me tell you the 50% off code
lasted for 48 out for 48 hours two days
and he was like well unfortunately I
can't healthy right now this is woman
when Thursday is one like a so windy or
Thursday you can't force me I can't help
you right now because whoever's person
who generates our code is line office so
I think I can't get back to you for 72
hours
but the Provo is in 48 hours he's been
totally sorry it seems like if it's
something on your engine nothing really
else I can tell you I can get back in 72
hours but like you said the code the
coast expired weapon so the back side
slope we should have popped up on your
screen for 50% off and nothing popped up
by child pre-computer something popped
up for 15% Elio News that one that would
work on like know who the trace program
said 60% off I won't do supersoft so I
know I should have done this but I was
sitting with Noah and I was like you
know what if you threw out though I'm a
youtuber card and I knew I'd never do
that that's not something I would ever
do because first up I don't consider
myself big youtuber but I was like you
know I wonder what would happen if I did
tell him I was a youtuber filming a
video about this experience does like
one sort of let me know that I am a
youtuber to 50,000 subscribers and I'm
gonna be filming a video trying on the
clothes I buy from this or the
experience that I hadn't working with
your company and he said many times give
me a moment let me see if I can generate
a code thank you for your patience and
about 30 minutes later I had a 50% off
code so I was like that's a little
interesting so if I was a regular
customer who signed up for your
newsletter like everyone else I wasn't
going to get a code but you could
generate one for a youtuber he said the
person who generated code was not
available for 72 hours but yet he got me
more than 30 minutes so my conclusion is
that there wasn't really a 50% off code
I don't know if you've got one that's
great let me know maybe I'm wrong but 20
or 30 people in their closets they
didn't get one all those comments were
deleted once I place my order about 24
hours later I can email thing respond we
have read trouble with your card and we
can't process this unless you send us a
photo of your debit card a photo of the
front in the back and a photo of the
front and back of your license your
driver's license I'm like that goes on
email you want to need to email this the
first I thought it was so scam I'm like
no real company would ever ask me for a
picture of my driver's license and my
credit card over an email that seems
really wrong I even called my bank my
bank says no do not do that so there's
an email me back saying well it's
nothing we can do unless you send us
this picture so we'll give you 24 hours
we're going to have to cancel your order
which by the way their website says they
cannot cancel any order after it's been
paid my order was already paid so
doesn't make any sense
my bank confirmed yes Sony has been
taken out he says only thing we can do
is cancel your order you can replace the
order using PayPal instead of a debit
card however is a 50% off coupon has
expired so you have to pay the original
price after a while it did not email me
back about 7 hours later I decided to
try contacting them via Live Support on
their website the way I contacted them
about 50% off code
I opened a wide scope a slice before and
it's about an hour into this an hour
into waiting for someone to answer me
and if someone comes into the chat and
as soon as I tell them that I need help
with my order and what what what's going
on they closed out of the live support
whoever wants or just closed out of the
live-aboard just let me there so I just
throw up on another life support waited
for another hour and then no one
responded so now I thought you know I'm
taking this to social media so I tweeted
and I also when commented on their
Instagram soon as I did that as soon as
I commented on their social media Sheedy
and me they tweeted me and they emailed
me back within five minutes saying oh
don't worry about it we're placing your
order everything's fine we're so sorry
about that we hope you enjoy your stuff
all I know is they place my order I got
my stuff in a few days
thankfully and I'm not saying the tiger
went to the scam I don't know I hadn't
really got experience I had a bad enough
experience I don't know if I was shop
with him again
but let's get on to the actual clothes
because I was really excited to buy
their stuff it just was it was way too
stressful for me to go through something
like that for them clothes ok so now on
to the actual hallmark of the stuff that
I got number one is a really cute body
design wearing now I do really like this
it is really pretty like a see-through
lace I love the lace detailing the
floral I think this is really pretty on
the only thing I don't like is you can't
real if your arms with it but I guess
that's kind of what you have to get when
you have like like admitted clothing so
it's not a big deal I do think it's
really pretty it feels like really good
material pretty good quality not
complaining about that Elise and the
second thing I thought was this really
pretty dress on the dress is absolutely
stunning it is incredible quality very
good material it's so pretty on
I love the floral I love the split in
the dress I love the tie up I love this
so much it is so pretty
I know where this for a photo shoot
really food I do love this dress and I
got this body to know this one is a
little bit tighter than the other pieces
but I got to all the same size I got
everything in an extra small this was a
little tighter on me like I was a little
nervous but it did fit enough so I'm
okay with that
it is a new sauna suit it's a little
see-through so I'm not to buy with some
pasties I think or my nips gonna be
showing freezin it so that's okay I'm
gonna have seen some really pretty like
kind of the same dead it's material
sleeve with its ashes at the same exact
pattern as this I just realized to make
sense because this one is also really
hard to lift your arms up it must just
be this meted materials it's kind of
hard to like move around it but this is
absolutely so pretty this was really
high-quality really high-end I think it
really stands out so I do love this body
food and next I got another body to this
one is a black lace-up line now this one
has a little bigger on me but I think
I'd have to tie me I don't think that's
anything their problem because the jobs
have there's a really nice lace up in
the back I think I've been tighten it
all the way for the Tryon it is really
stunning I think this would be really
fun for a night out really pretty with
some black jeans maybe a cool jacket and
this might be my favorite thing is just
cream floral body food I love the
material it is so soft like I know what
this is made out of because I don't
think it says it feels like soap so this
feel myself beautiful cream color the
beautiful floral design so soft and
silky it's like very like slinky that
makes it look kind of hugs your curves
and hugs to your body which makes you
look really good it's just this is
absolutely beautiful I love this
bodysuit
international I got this really pretty
white lacy crop top or like tire out
crop this looks like something you would
get at Topshop in like 90 bucks and I
spent like it was originally like 30 I
think but then I got of like 15 pretty
is pretty for to watch later on this one
it looks really good looks really cute
looks like it something on where it's
really Coachella like pair with a really
pretty cardigan and next I got a really
pretty over the shoulder cup spleen crop
how I love this one I love the pattern
it looks really good all I look so
dressed like the photos I'm really
the impressed with this one and
absolutely pretty cups please it also
comes with a matching showgirl where I
put it
some of the matching choker which I
think this is so cute I'm definitely
wear this one a lot and I got this but
it through right here it's a long sleeve
body food really pretty like see-through
lace husband material but it's like not
see-through on the boob area which is
nice because like a nice like nude cloth
underneath it really pretty bill type
sleeve it's also good like it's not that
is a bodysuit is a very very wide open
neck very plunging v-neck but I think
this is really nice that's really nice
like a night out I think I'm paired this
with a really pretty bra less like it
was really nice and then I also got a
bail because I need a new belt and I
always hope this my Urban Outfitters
just looks a lot like the bill I always
see the Urban Outfitters because this is
a lot cheaper I think this is so cute I
love it edgy belt I love I slowed this
film so although I did preorder one item
so it's not your app your order to
really really a pretty really pretty
black floral bodysuit which I'm so
excited for so clothing I would give an
e plus the company I don't know about
that so I'll let you guys make it out
for yourself have you shot the tiger
Mitch let me know the comment down below
if you have what do you think what are
your thoughts and yes now let's move on
to back Anubha so back to around back
ANOVA I actually worked with a once or
twice before they did do something a
little crappy to me once but I don't
really know if that reflects on them too
much
basically I am supposed to do a
sponsorship with them they send me a ton
of clothes and they offer me a sum of
money to do a trial haul and the
clothing was really great I've always
liked fashion I was closed and but I go
oh I've only ever had them sent to me
I've never bought them they sent them to
me and said hey we'd love for you to try
on haul we'll pay you this amount of
money I just I was really trying to grow
my Instagram's all the case I would be
okay to be paying half of that if you
would promote my photos on your
Instagram and they said yes and who
would who wouldn't take that from all
picture is perhaps Lascars
i was like and they said yes i was like
oh yeah oh yeah I was so excited to go
her Instagram I was so excited so I just
a sponsorship but just a video I got
paid that was fine they were pretty nice
y'all the whole thing and I sent them
all the photos I posted on Instagram and
no one ever is posted in my name times
just like the GM them an email
hey said he was like post like though
roads like I was exciting so go post in
and I got an Instagram response oh
there's ladies too much he had no idea
what I was talking about was like hey
feel free to email us and we'll see what
we can do but I don't really know
anything about that and you know I don't
I don't know and so I decided to email
someone and she said hey yo yeah we're
gonna post in like it's into was we have
a few photos we're going to post it will
get to yours eventually well it's been
six months seven months eight months can
reach out again because I was like am
whatever so that kind of stopped I was
pretty disappointed with that because
you know I was offered a lot more money
than they pay me and they were supposed
to do that they didn't do it so I kind
of like hurt my feelings I was more
disappointed but I'm letting go I'm
letting go letting it go so I decided to
go I don't know fashion OVA actually has
a clothing store now they opened up
stores like in California I think my
cacique might not be just California I
don't know but I saw one in California
all this wool sock you know behind a
store we got to go in so I purchased
four items and I thought I would see
what they're like when you don't get
them sent to use a lot of people saves
you get items sent to you there's a lot
different than when you buy things so I
thought I would find out for myself
this thing is beautiful when you put it
on and feels like a good quality it
feels like good material this is such a
nice dress for going out like it looks
so good like a little play on your side
like so sexy I love the floral decor
going into the floral stuff right now I
mean it's so trendy I love where it goes
over your neck so it's a halter you
don't need a bra with this next I got
this dress it's like a little simple
dress look like it's a black dress that
is bleached as a body Cod
spaghetti straps pretty simple I think
it's really cute with some cardigans and
it'd be like a denim jacket and I think
I got this denim romper no one freaking
loves this thing I wanted to my last
video I do like it I saw it on the shelf
and I actually wanted a different denim
romper intend to but the other one was
like really high and I couldn't reach it
so I've decided just to get this one
Modell's was really nice aw I love the
waist up just dips in the back it is a
very thick denim material it looks good
quality and looks like it'd be a little
uncomfortable but it saw it's a very
soft in them which I like is not super
uncomfortable
yeah I know laughs oh now he's perfected
over I got a pair of denim shorts do you
thought really
I like to throughout superstore bazaar
not like to show it off to but the whole
time
and honestly plenty of my sugar stroking
but my butt the whole time but like I
need your pears it like work like that
hey I thought these are super cute I
like the colors with a light wash I love
the floral detail I got like a million
things with squirrel detail like I need
to chill out I decided everything for my
haul let me know in the comments have
you ever shopped with pleasure miss have
you ever shopped about you know low what
are your thoughts now you know why
I'm pretty torn with Tiger miss I do
like back to Nova both of them are on
the pricier side if you're used to
shopping like forever 21 not like too
expensive luggage do they do they are
both like pretty good quality so you
kind of get what you pay for
like I said I'm taller that's all I know
what just that's all I know I don't know
let me know if you think I should shop a
tiger miss again and give them one more
chance and see what happens and then
