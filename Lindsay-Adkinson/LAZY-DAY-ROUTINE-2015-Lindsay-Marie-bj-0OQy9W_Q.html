be setting an alarm i will probably lay
in bed for a while when i wake up which
is the nicest thing ever i will
typically watch some sort of TV play on
my phone love my dogs until i am finally
ready to get out of bed and typically
that might take a little while
so I love to read a book to relax but
this day actually decided to read a
magazine because I was reading a
magazine that was all about viners
youtubers and young entrepreneurs so of
course I had to read it to get some
insight next I will typically make some
sort of yummy baked goods on this day I
made homemade peanut butter cookies they
were delicious and I lounge around and
ate like half of them which hey don't
judge me then I will probably get back
on my computer hey I mean it is a lazy
day and I'll probably either sit on
youtube or watch Netflix or just do
something pretty unproductive literally
evening it is finally time for the girly
parts of my lazy day which could usually
consist of painting my nails doing a
face mask and a hair mask this day I
actually decided to try out this new
face mask it was a peel-off one that I
have never used before it was really
weird as you can tell but from my facial
expressions I was not used to this but
it actually worked it really really well
it was just a really interesting
consistency and I've never used a
peel-off mask
so hey don't forget to give me a thumbs
up for my super awkward kind of
uncomfortable facial expressions when I
was taking off this peel off mask like i
told you i was super intrigued by this
after being super lazy all day I will
typically typically do some sort of lazy
stretches if you'd like to see my lazy
day workout routine make sure to give
this video a thumbs up and let me know
in the comments and I can do that really
soon also i will then it make some kind
of yummy really cheap food which is
normally pizza in my diet and then after
that i will land around lips on the
couch watch some netflix and just hang
out with my dogs for the rest of the
evening
thank you guys so much for watching my
lazy day routine I have these pretty
often um it's okay to have a lazy day
every now and then and it's okay to just
sit back and relax I read on a ride on
some uber article one time that she
thinks it's good to take like one day
brunette now I'm gonna just do nothing
just to reflect in relax so if Oprah
says it's good it's good so thank you
guys so much for watching I hope you
enjoyed it let's try get this video to
as many thumbs up as possible so hit
that thumbs up button don't forget to
subscribe I love you guys so much don't
wanna miss on my videos and I will see
you all in my next video bye guys
