or welcome if you are new to today's
video is a life hacks for girls and I
haven't done one of these in a little
while but you guys have been requesting
it so I heard Jeff your girl is back
with another life hack now my video is a
partner with spec ok they have a new
campaign going on all about owning it
and I am so trying to partner with them
you'll face throughout the whole video
get excited it's so it's so awesome it's
just so awesome so special k has a new
campaign going on and I watched it and I
was literally no and I were both
watching it I was like tearing up
because it was so good I'll link the
campaign commercial down below it's all
about owning your bought your body your
life your mind your your food it's so
good it's so like girl power and
empowering which leads me to my very
first life hacks and that is all about
owning your food and owning what you eat
because one we all eat now let me know
in the comments down below if you did
this because I remember for a long time
in high school and even in college and
stuff I would be afraid to eat in front
of people I don't know why I was afraid
to be in front of people and it's like
why we we all eat we all eat there's
nothing bad about eating eating is
normal you know we eat we happy we need
to eat eating is fun
I love eating okay so from the Special K
the first one I got two cereals this is
a nourish apple raspberry almond
and then I got the red berry one as well
this one is so yummy and I also have
these bites and all these are my
favorite so I have the nourish spice and
these have our dark chopped-up pistachio
and they made with almond butter and I
love almond butter so that's great and
then they also have the protein bites
and these have 9 grams of protein
they're great because they have visible
ingredients you know what's in them I
love these for on-the-go describing them
keeping in my car when I'm having a busy
day that way I know if what I'm eating
what I'm putting into my body and they
taste great
now this please think into my next point
and that is dealing with bikini season
now so many people think they have to
have a specific look to what for bikinis
and here's the real truth all you have
to do is put a bikini on feel confident
love the body me that you have because
your body is perfect and it's beautiful
just how it is put a bikini on or a
swimsuit or whatever you want to wear go
to the pool and have a good
next comes two bras my biggest tip is no
bras at home the first thing I do when I
walk in the door is I flip it off
through my t-shirt like I watched my mom
doing my whole life and I remember I
used to always wonder how do they do
that and then figure it out and my life
has changed
I don't wear bras at home because I
don't want to wear them a home and girl
that's all that matters
thank you a big tip is making sure you
are wearing the right bra size because
that can change the life girls girls so
what I like to do is just go into
anywhere where you can buy bras and get
fitted for a bra and you might think
that's going to cost money but honestly
usually it doesn't usually even if
you're not buying a bra from the store
they will give you a free bra fitting
and wearing red bra size can make all
the difference
my biggest fitness hack is going to be
finding someone that motivates you and
empowers you to go to the gym together
me and nila go to the gym together and
we are always keeping each other on
track in a good way like we're keeping
each other in a good positive mindset
we're not going to say anything bad
about ourselves
nothing discouraging in any way at all
no body shaming nothing at all we're
positive encouraging and keep each other
like in a good positive mindset at the
gym it's also fun to go together because
we like help each other with our
workouts and all that good stuff now
we've all dealt with breakups at least I
mean I have dealt with a breakup you
dealt with a breakup I'm possibly most
likely we have dealt with some kind of
heartbreak the biggest way to get over
heartbreak I would say is a girls night
lots of snacks and just having fun and
now if you need to cry from it and grow
in your allows of you are allowed to cry
but only firm at least like two minutes
and then wash off the funny movies East
will eat lots of snacks hang out with
your friends get out of the house thumb
and also knowing that better things are
always coming you know just like an
arrow you can only pull it so far back
in school launch forward that's what
you're doing you're just launching
forward and break off breakups are okay
you're going to something better will
come along I promise you it will all
make sense now when it comes to
arguments and friendships I have to say
put your pride away I wish I'd listened
to this to myself a few years ago
because I have lost a friend
dudes not putting my pride away and just
owning up to my mistakes or like even if
I didn't even think I was in the wrong
saying sorry first anyways can make a
big difference
if you and your friends have had some
kind of silly argument even if you don't
think you're wrong say you're sorry
because in the long run you're going to
wish you had it's it's silly to let
ourselves like ruin friendships over
things so small so say you're sorry give
them a peace offering of some sort and
let yourselves a move on ok guys so that
is it for my life hacks for girls thanks
