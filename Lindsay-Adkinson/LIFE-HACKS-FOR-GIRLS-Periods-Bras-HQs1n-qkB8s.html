or welcome if you are new today's video
is going to be life hacks for girls
these are very very girly life hacks I
think for the most part yes they are a
lot of these do you have to deal with
like that time of the month stuff so if
you're uncomfortable hearing about that
you're probably not a female so why are
you watching this white white bye bye
buddy
but if you are a female and you are
comfortable hearing about this stuff
let's do some life let's listen to some
life changing life hacks boo now there
are a few that are not that time of the
month related Chi not just a period I
can say period there are some that are
not period related but that I just
wanted to add in so let's go ahead and
get started number one is a crazy
awesome little gadget that I found this
is called a handbag light this is just
the packaging I don't know why I still
have this but I do this is called a
handbag light and it's from the brand
Worcester starting what wats are
stunning I hope that's what it's called
this is really really cool it's
basically like a motion sensors light so
whenever you open your purse you're
looking for something it turns on a
little light so you can find what you're
looking for I usually would take my
phone and turn on like my my flashlight
so I can dig through my bag so this will
literally just turn on as soon as you
open your purse because you clip this
inside of your bag and once it sees your
hand going into the bag it will light up
for 15 seconds at a time now you can't
get these on their website but you can
also get them on Amazon they're really
really inexpensive really affordable
they're just you know like like
necessary my next thing is the stay up
strapless bra oh my goodness hello
friends now this is for those times when
you need a really awesome strapless bra
because how many times how many times
you put on a strapless bra and one it
falls down or slips and you're just like
doing this all night and that is so
frustrating or how many times you put on
a strapless bra it's not very flattering
now that is not the case with these now
I've seen so many youtubers talk about
this I was like alright gotta try them
out so these have like silicone grips
all on them so like they do not slip
they do not fall they fit very snug and
also they have like this really
interesting
pat like padding here it's got you
little hearts there that really really
gives you like a good lift while you're
wearing them because we all know the
strapless bras can kind of make your
boobs look kind of push down so these
will make your boobs pushed up and
they're also going to really hold
everything in place they make you look
incredible they and the mmm in credible
next is an app that I use all the time
I'm someone who really likes to stay
organized and it comes at that time of
the month so clue is a free app that you
can get in iOS or Android and it
basically will track your period when
your next periods coming and also will
tell you when you're going to have your
next set of like PMS and the cool thing
is it will also send you reminders to
let you know if you're getting close to
that time the one so you kind of
remember like oh hey your girl needs to
go to the store and buy some chocolate
and some tampons
now clue does a lot of other beneficial
things as well like it can tell you when
you're most likely to get pregnant
you're least likely to get pregnant it
can also tell you like I can send you
daily reminders to take your birth
control now they can also give you a lot
of additional explanation or like
insight on what's going on with your
body anytime in a month you can tell
information about your mood your pains
your sexual activity and the app can
kind of give you information on like
what might be going on with your body
which can make you feel a lot better if
you're having some kind of like scary
thoughts or pains or anything like that
now as if you need any other reason to
snack on some chocolate during that time
of the month your body is actually
losing heaps of magnesium when you're on
your period and so it's actually really
great to regain that back and a good way
to do that is with chocolate now I'm not
saying to go to a gas station and grab
like you know a Hershey's bar or
Snickers bar but grab something that is
dark chocolate something that is 70%
dark chocolate is going to give you that
nutrient back and also it tastes great
so what know what else you need is not
loaded with as much sugar as if as like
a normal milk chocolate bar now my
favorite dark chocolate candy for that
time of month is jojo's chocolate Park
I think I saw this from Megan rinks I
think it was Megan rings it's got like
all the information about how good it is
for you because it is good for you and
it's satisfying which is I mean
chocolate and yeah hey chocolate girl
now this one probably seems really
really like common sense but honestly
drink as much water as you possibly can
when you're on your period like you are
losing a lot of fluids and your body can
get really dehydrated very easily now
I'm not saying to sip on water all day
honestly a good thing to do is chug
water on your period and that's actually
going to really
with bloating and fatigue if you find
that you blown a lot or that you're
really tired drink a ton of water and
drink just get a lot in your system as
much as possible
and I promise you you're going to feel a
ton better and it's good for you so I
mean you know there are two types of
things I like to do during that time of
the month what I'm having lots of
cramping
the first one is vinyasa flow yoga that
is incredible because typically your
muscles are really tight and I know you
don't want to get out of bed but I
promise a little bit of loosening and
stretching out those muscles will make
you feel a lot better and help ease up
the cramps and another thing is a hot
water bottle fill up a plastic water
bottle of some sort with a ton of hot
water a really really warm water and put
that on your stomach you can put it over
like a washcloth or a blanket and that
makes me feel so good they do have that
the bottles you can buy in store which
is like it's called like a hot water
bottle for your period but you could
just fill up like an old asani water
bottle and it's cheaper you know so yeah
alright guys those are some of my
favorite tips or tricks for being a
female and that time of the month and
just you know stuff to make your life a
little bit easier so if you'd like to
