welcome back I am back you're probably
like what do you mean you're back have
you been gone yes I actually haven't
filmed like two or three months besides
my vlog so now I packed up all the way
from Ohio and all the way to hold on
little ruse here packed up from Ohio and
get a road trip all the way to Los
Angeles California and this is our new
apartment and also we got a puppy's me
so cute
this is rooster this is our new dog
rooster yet sometimes we call him Roo
his name was originally ro but now I
call rooster and he's so cute
he's a Maltese I'm you got him from like
someone we knew in Oklahoma her dog had
puppies and we're like oh my gosh
today's video is a fitness video I'm so
excited to so many people like hate New
Year's resolutions I love New Year's
resolutions I get so motivated and it
really honestly New Year's resolutions
can fuel me for like months honestly so
I think if you have resolutions go you
if you don't have some it's never too
late to start you don't have to have in
January first you can start resolutions
once a month you can have like monthly
resolutions I carry out just the first
month what about resolutions this month
hello
uh-huh so a lot of people have fitness
goals so I thought I would do a video oh
my gosh what are you doing hello hello I
thought I would do a video on like ways
to get fit for 2017 Velocity's work for
whenever you're watching this
so another one thing I would just say is
no shortcuts I see so many things all
the time on TV magazines kind of um they
really get in but you don't want to get
rid in for like shortcuts like diet
pills and quick ways to lose weight and
like waist trainers and all these crazy
ideas they say they're gonna like make
you lose weight fast all these titles
lose weight fast I would stay away from
those most likely they're unhealthy most
likely they're only gonna if they do
work it's only going to work for a
little while and then it's not gonna
work forever and they're probably really
unhealthy for you to be completely
honest so the best thing is to stop
using shortcuts and just do the actual
work which is healthy healthy diet and
exercise number two that leaves on to
the second part is your diet so add
the kitchen everyone says that and it
really is the truth you can work you can
do ad works
ad workouts every single day of your
life but if you eat nothing but junk
food every day you might not notice a
very big difference now I'm not saying
to never eat junk food
I literally if I go like two days
without eating something like that I
want to eat no one knows I get really
grouchy and also be like I don't want
eat healthy today so I have to have a
balance so I think it's good to have a
balance so just make sure you are
getting your daily fruits and vegetables
in drinking lots of water and just
having a pretty good diet but like I
said don't don't deprive yourself of the
things you like as well so just have a
healthy diet but I also help a healthy
balance number three is running random
is a really quick and easy way to get in
a workout running can be really fun it's
something you do with your friends you
can do it over lake scenic area go go
into the middle of a city go to app are
go to the beach go for pretty run and
honestly if you don't want to run sorrow
by walking you know work your way up to
jogging then before you know it you're
going to be sprinting your way along
there's plenty of apps you can do to
help you run faster to time yourself you
could also just listen to music your
floor is joining joining a groups of
some sort you join a sports team does
that in what age you are there are still
plenty of like rec sports teams or make
a sports team with your friends you can
also join a workout class I know those
can be a little expensive though but
spin classes bar classes yoga classes
those can be really really fun and
really motivational when you have people
working around working out all around
you people with the same kind of goals
they kind of push you which is a good
thing next is going to be find a routine
that works for you everyone is different
everyone enjoys different things working
out does not have to be painful working
out it's not have to be boring it can be
what you want it to be everyone is
different everyone likes different
things if you hate running then don't
run if you hate going to a gym don't go
to gym if you keep working on your
apartment don't work at home you know
there's so many different things you can
do so many different types of workouts I
would say experiment try different
workouts for a few weeks and decide okay
what do I like and then once you find
out what you like stick to it for a
little while because we are what you say
what a no-call it would you put
creatures of habit creatures of habit so
if you do it really see like a week or
two weeks one specific thing it will
become part of your routine and before
you know it's me so much easier to stick
to that routine
so basically final works for you
experiment and then try and make your
routine out of it and that's not least
is going to be your mindset I know I say
every video sometimes people get annoyed
but it really is the truth if you walk
around say you hate your body or you
hate dieting or you hate this then it's
not going to do anything if you say like
oh I don't wanna work out today oh I
don't want to eat this today then you're
not gonna do it I asked how it works if
I wake up in the morning say ah I don't
wanna work out today I mostly I'm not
going to work out so if you start by
having a positive mindset it really is
going to push you to do more if you
start out by saying oh my god I'm so
excited
today I'm so excited to eat food that
it's good for my body I'm so excited to
go to the gym and do something good for
myself or hang out with my friends and
go for a run you're gonna find out that
like the more you fake it in your mind
the more you're going to actually want
to do it because it's just just your
mentality and also along the way make
sure to love yourself because if you're
not already happy with the body or in
that's not a good thing either so make
sure to love yourself however you are
you are beautiful every single body type
every single body it's beautiful you are
gorgeous I love you so don't ever think
about watching these videos that your
body isn't good enough never try and
look like a certain other person the
goal of these videos is to be healthy
and happy not to be like someone else
and not to be you know not to be unhappy
or anything like that so make sure to
love yourself and know that you are
beautiful however you are I love you
very much
I hope you guys enjoyed this video make
sure to give it a big thumbs up if you
enjoyed it make sure to leave any
comments down below what videos you want
to see next
should I keep doing fitness videos I
think I want to start doing like one a
week or maybe want every other week let
me know I love you guys very very very
much and I'll see you all next time bye
good good this looks just like you when
I say that but like focus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
