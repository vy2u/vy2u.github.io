happen to be new today's video is my
morning routine now this is gonna be
like my productive work day type morning
routine so hopefully you guys enjoy this
and also this video is in sponsorship
with Tampax proactive which was very
excited about so hopefully you'll love
this video and give it a thumbs up if
you're excited and let's get started
good morning so during the week Noah
actually goes to class a pretty early so
he isn't home when I wake up which is
sad but I've been setting my alarm
across the room so that it forces me to
get out of bed in the morning I've
really honestly been enjoying getting up
early so after snuggling with the dogs I
will get up and make my bed I used to
honestly hate making my bed but then
after forcing myself to do it for a few
weeks now it's honestly just a habit and
how sweet is sleeping Milo she's so cute
so then I will head to the bathroom and
brush my teeth and today's video is
actually sponsored by Tampax it is
actually currently that time of the
month for me so it is good timing
so Tampax for octave tampons come in a
variety of absorbency to help on your
lightest to heaviest days they give you
up to eight hours of comfortable
protection which I love they have a
motion fit protection which moves with
you for up to 100% leak free workouts
and the leak guard braid help stop leaks
before they happen and the smooth
removal layer is great for comfort even
on the lightest days of your period I
have always been a fan of Tampax pearl
active since they give me amazing
protection and they help me stay active
in even on my period I love that I can
continue with my normal daily activities
and be worryfree so that's awesome I
will have links to Tampax pearl octave
in the description box now it's time to
take out the pups they love morning
walks in so do I it hasn't been as cold
recently in Ohio so we all get more
fresh air and yeah we can just walk a
little bit longer which is fun I love
hanging out with them anyways they're
like my friends so once we're back in
time for coffee baby
I have been really loving waking up
earlier just so that I can drink my
coffee on the couch with our little fake
but it does let out heat fireplace on
and read for a little while reading is
almost like a form of meditation for me
it gets me out of my head and really
helps with my anxiety and really just
clears my mind I have always loved to
read do you like to read if so what is
your favorite book let me know if you
have a favorite book in the comment and
maybe I'll read it I also make sure to
take extra time and snuggle with the
pups in the morning especially on
workdays because I know I didn't get as
much attention as they like on those
days so I could give them as much
attention in the morning as possible
before I start working and then after
I'm done I will head back to the kitchen
and first I will make it to-do list I
love writing down everything I have to
do for the day I don't know just getting
everything out of my head and like where
I can see it makes me feel so much more
organized and ready to take on the day
and I honestly just do smoothies almost
every morning
sometimes I pair it with these really
yummy sweet potato pancakes I got at
Whole Foods but I was out so I just went
on for my smoothie I love adding a ton
of fruit a ton of greens I usually just
do like spinach and kale almond milk
pressed OJ now a lot of people think the
OJ in milk is gross but honestly with a
vanilla almond milk and OJ it kind of
tastes like orange sherbert just just
try it
I also added flaxseed and chia seed and
oatmeal I forgot to put my oatmeal in it
which is crazy cuz I usually put oatmeal
in my smoothie every morning oatmeal
such a good way and your smoothie to
help keep you full so definitely try
that out and then I just normally take
my vitamins and make sure to drink a
full glass of water this is also about
the time I will start scrolling on my
phone
mainly on Instagram then back to my room
to meditate now I use all different
meditating apps I have like 6 downloaded
on my phone I think I'm using simple
habit in this one because they actually
have a good bit of free meditations I
also really like to meditate without an
app that's actually like my favorite
thing to do with meditate without an app
but I know you guys are always curious
about meditation a lot of you guys have
not tried it yet or you know trying to
get into it
and I definitely think guided meditation
apps are the easiest way to start so
definitely try that out meditating has
changed my life I used to be extremely
anxious depressed and stress all the
time now okay now I still get anxious
and stress but nowhere near as much it's
just overall great from my mental health
and my life just try it
trust me and then after I meditated and
my stomach is off settle it is time to
do my workout I typically work out like
four to five morning's a week recently
and for this particular workout I was
doing a little bit of yoga and then also
a little bit of Pilates now this is not
my typical workout routine I'm actually
testing out another celebrities like a
workout and diet for an upcoming video
hint hint so that's what I'm doing this
morning and it was actually pretty fun
and I've actually really started to like
yoga then I hop in the shower not
literally hot but I walk into the shower
and for once in a morning routine I am
washing my hair like whoa no way I don't
think I've ever washed my hair in the
morning or night routine hey but I'm
doing it today now that I'm not wearing
extensions and I cut my hair shorter I
can wash my hair in warmer water again
and the color stays pretty long with the
shampoo and conditioner that I'm using I
still typically only wash my hair every
two to three days though just to keep my
color fresh and everything then I just
finished my shower wash my face and head
on out if I'm not doing anything that
day I will always let my hair air dry
and put on comfy clothes however since I
was filming I picked out a decently cute
outfit and headed to get ready I put it
in this blow-dry spray and blow-dried my
hair I don't really do anything special
when I blow-dry my hair I used to use
like a round brush and everything but my
hair honestly dries so fast I don't even
like bother with it now honestly loving
the shorter hair life PS should I do
like a short hairstyles video let me
know in the comments maybe I will
then on to my makeup I don't wear makeup
every day again only on filming days
really you guys have just been really
asking me about my go-to filming makeup
so I thought it was a good time to show
you I also always listen to some
when I'm getting ready either a podcast
which is typically Oprah super soul
Sunday totally my favorite or I will
listen to just Pandora and since there
weren't any new super Souls out I opted
for some music the 90s to now hits is
definitely my favorite station ever such
a must-have I always start with my
moisturizer and my primer just to get my
skin all prepped and ready then I go in
with my foundation and this is
definitely my favorite right now and
then I apply it with a damp Beauty
Blender and conceal under my eyes and
then I bake my concealer even though I
don't know what that does but I do it
anyways for my brows I just do a light
fill-in they are micro weighted so they
don't really need much filling in but I
like giving them a bit more color
because they're kind of like a dull
color right now so this gives it like a
little bit more of a brown tint in a
sharper edge also totally jamming out
the entire time I film this video in
this entire part but that is what life
is about and it puts you in such a great
mood whenever you you are wanting like a
mood boost totally just try turning on
Pandora and like jamming out it will
totally work it works for me every time
I want to like getting a good ring for
my eyeshadow I've just been using this
nude beach palette by the balm I love it
in the packaging is so cute
I always just add a light brown in my
crease with a fluffy brush and then a
pretty sparkly goldish color all over my
lid
and then I just take a fluffy brush and
a darker Brown on to the outer area just
to deepen it up that is pretty much all
I do you guys are always asking and it's
pretty simple so nothing too crazy and I
always tend to line my lid I practice
for so many years with a winged liner
and I feel like I finally am okay at it
so whew practice makes perfect so then
it is add my bronzer to my typical
bronzing areas a slight little nose
contour add some blush then I use the
mary lou manizer highlighter by the way
oh my gosh guys it is amazing
favorite highlighter hands-down I mean
do you see that glow anyways the nidus a
curl my lashes add a little mascara and
I always just go for some type of pinky
nude lip color this is what I've been
using typically I will have everything
linked about down below
usual and lala time for my hair I always
use a heat protectant first which is so
important guys I didn't use any heat
protectant when I was younger and I
fried my hair from so much heat and
damage learn from my mistakes please
just use the heat protectant and not too
much heat okay you get what I'm saying
oh so then I just put my curling iron on
a very low heat setting cuz my hair is
very thin and I just kind of messily
curl it in both directions all over I
like to do a lot of curls and then
hairspray it and then mess them mess
them up a bit for like a toss old type
of look I really like the way it looks
and I do tighter curls so that as it
falls throughout the day it still looks
pretty good and then I'm just adding on
any smell Goods and accessories and I am
all done time to get to work and film
some videos so love you guys thanks for
