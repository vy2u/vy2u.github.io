hi guys welcome back to my channel today
I'm doing a morning routine but not any
morning routine this is for those days
that we all have we stay up too late
watching Netflix or lifestyle and that's
what I do or studying or just doing
whatever we ended up hitting that snooze
button away too many times thumbs up
this video if that's you and we just end
up being late so these are gonna this is
gonna be a morning routine but with my
personal life hacks for getting ready
quicker so that we can get out the door
and hopefully not be late for whatever
I'm doing that day and also this is a
collab video with Chloe she does tons of
makeup video she has like she's
beautiful just wait to see her she's
absolutely gorgeous she's going to be
doing a makeup tutorial for a morning
that you're running late or just a
running late makeup tutorial so when
you're done watching my video make sure
to go ahead and watch her as I promise
you she is beautiful you won't regret
checking out her channel subscribe to
her if you're new to my channel from her
channel please subscribe I love you guys
so much and without further ado let's
get into the video so he even in the
morning when I'm running late I have to
start off with my morning coffee luckily
that didn't take too long and I just
carry that around with me for the
morning and then I go out to immediately
brush my teeth that's like the first
thing I do every single morning and then
I apply some quick makeup my life hack
for makeup is just applying concealer
mascara and just a necessity so that way
you're not spending too much time it's
there to look decent than to try and do
too much and rush through it then for my
hair the night before I applied micro
Olympique texture treatment I love this
stuff it makes my hair feel really
healthy and adds a lot of texture so
then I just braided my hair the night
before so that way my hair would be good
to go in the morning because I was up
way too late so they don't have to do is
add in my leave inch texture spray this
is really good for adding moisture and
also adding a lot of texture to your
hair and it's also by Appaji they are
actually having a buy two get one free
sale which is why I got three products
obviously I will link the sale down
below
I'm done adding my texture treatment and
I just make sure it's really sprint and
then I go in my app with my Apogee curl
the fit curl definer this stuff is
heavenly this is the third product I got
for my bike to get three get one free
sale which is incredible of course I had
to let you guys know that then I just
scrunch my hair a little bit more to
make sure it's going to hold and that is
my hair for the day looks really nice
and put together but it took me no time
at all because I did it overnight for my
outfit I just like to plug keep it
simple I like to go with the white
t-shirt and of course before I continue
of course Foster interrupted but he was
cute so that's okay and then continuing
on with my outfit I just always choose
on the simple jeans a simple t-shirt
something really really simple with some
nice tennis shoes or some flip-flops so
that way I'm not making anything crazy
and I don't have to worry about
announcing keep it simple when you're
running late and then for mine at
breakfast when I'm running late I just
like to do a smoothie it's so simple you
just throw a few things in a blender
blend it up throw it in a tumbler cup
and you can go out the door so that is
my morning routine when I'm running late
hope my life hacks helped you leave any
comments thumbs up this video if you
want a light tax night routine and I
will see you guys all my next video bye
