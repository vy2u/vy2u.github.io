today's video is my diet and exercise
routine this is super requested and I
really wanted to get up get it up for
you guys
I really want to yeah I wanted to upload
this video for you guys I am actually
pre filming this video right now because
as you are watching this I honestly have
a lot going on right now
first thing currently my dog my love the
Eskimo Spitz is very very sick and so
I'm having to do a lot with her and I'm
trying not to like get upset about it on
camera
Goodin I'm also getting my wisdom teeth
out if you're watching this I'm probably
getting about like the same day or the
next day or the day before so I just
don't want to have videos up for you
guys so please know if I'm not
responding to comments it's because I
probably just had my wisdom teeth out
and I'm dealing with milah and that's
just a lot going on right now so it's
gonna be kind of hard for me to respond
to all comments immediately but I will
do my best and I will get back to normal
videos and not pre up pre-filming next
week my intros are normally not this
long as you know so let's go ahead and
get into the video but I promise my diet
my first and foremost tip is just to get
all of your daily nutrients and that's
actually a lot easier than it sounds on
who would think that's a difficult thing
but it's really not I just make sure
that every single day I get in my daily
amount of fruits and vegetables and
that's going to keep you healthy feeling
good looking good and it's gonna make
your metabolism a lot higher as well I
always put a handful or two a fruit with
my breakfast that I'll also just do
about a handful or two or three of fruit
in my smoothie every single day so I do
have a smoothie probably every day and
that's my biggest like tip is if you're
not really good at having all your
fruits and vegetables make a smoothie
cuz you can throw so much into that and
I also put about a cup or a cup and a
half of spinach into my smoothie every
single day so then with my dinner every
night I will just have some sort of
vegetable with it and that altogether
adds up to be about my daily amount
amount of servings of fruits and
vegetables but I'm not someone who's
going to deprive myself of foods that I
don't like so I still eat the things I
like to eat like I eat Oreos
I still eat pizza I think I like to eat
I just also make sure I get all of my
daily fruits and vegetables every single
day and I also don't overdo it on things
that I like it's just proportionate
and having some willpower is key the
other thing is getting in all of your
water I think that's really helped me
because I just I do not explain it but I
felt so much better since I started
drinking all of my water I used to not
drink enough water and I always felt
groggy and never really had enough
energy to do my exercises now I drink
about 4 or 5 water bottles every single
day and I feel incredible if you're
someone that struggles with cooking
healthy meals I 110 percent recommend
home chef's I've been using home chef
for a pretty long while I think I saw it
from Nikki Phillippi actually I'm not
100 in sure but I feel like she's used
it in a vlog or something I think that's
where I heard of it home chef is kind of
like online grocery shopping except
you're buying an entire meal at once so
on home chef it's super affordable very
affordable I'll pay like a certain price
and then they'll send me like three
meals a week so it's kind of like meal
prepping except for I cook it so I
really like home chef because they send
me about three miles a week very
affordable it's the same prices I would
spend as going to the grocery store it
gives me a full recipe list of what
exactly I'm going to need to prepare the
meal it gives me all the nutrition facts
so it's basically like cooking something
at home except you just don't have to go
out and buy this stuff and you also
don't have to find the recipe they're
gonna send you the recipe based off the
preferences you give them whether you
know you're vegetarian or you you know
certain stuff like that gluten free and
I really really like that because I'm
not someone who was very good at coming
up with healthy meals but I do like to
cook at home so that way it would send
me the full meal I got to cook it and I
knew it was good for me the same time
now when it comes to exercising first
off everyone's always asking me like
where I buy my workout clothes that's
like the hands-down number one question
would you guys like to see a workout
clothing haul or something or workout
clothing collection let me know in the
comments I do buy most of my workout
clothes from abundant life yoga I think
it's abundant like cocom however they do
have an Amazon shop so I always shop off
Amazon they do also have like a Facebook
page where they post all of like a bunch
of sales so I typically will look off
their Facebook page or their Amazon
account but I do have a website as well
so yeah I do buy a bunch of my stuff off
of abundant like
yoga or abundant life cocom they have a
bunch of like really cute Fitness
clothes which is what I'm wearing in
this in my fitness part of this video
that you'll see they have a bunch of
cute like yoga mats that's where I got
my yoga mat they had yoga mat bags they
have like just tons of different like
activewear stuff so I do recommend that
you guys are always asking me so I
thought I would just let you know now it
comes to my workouts I love yoga yoga
might be my favorite thing just because
I'm not someone who loves super high
intense workouts but I do recommend
having a little bit of both so what I
like to do is I typically will workout
depending on my mood honestly if I wake
up and I feel like really stressed out
and I just want to relax I'm gonna do
some good old yoga or if I wake up and
I'm feeling like high-strung and
energetic then I'm gonna do some cardio
so I don't think you have to stick to a
specific workout every day just work out
how you want to work out I think
exercising is better than no exercising
you know what being active is better
than not being active so don't feel like
you have to go to like one yoga class 3
days a week if that's not what you like
if you like it go for it I also don't
like to work out in classes I was doing
that for a while but I realized that was
kind of like hindering my effects
because we're hindering my mood almost
because there be days when I didn't want
to do yoga but I had a membership so I
was only doing yoga and I really can't I
don't want to do it today so that's why
I started working out at home I do use a
website for working out it's called
Crocker gr ok keer dot-com it's really
cool it's basically just like a fitness
library they have um fitness videos and
yoga videos they have meditation they
also have cooking videos but I typically
just use the workout videos so I
actually have a mindset where I'm gonna
workout three days a week so I will
remind me on my email three days a week
like hey you're supposed to workout
today
it's basically got like a big online
library what I would call it of like
fitness trainers who film videos for you
to do at home it's got all different
types of videos like I said all
different advanced levels from like
beginner to like hardcore depending on
like my mood it's got all different
links so that way if I'm pressed for
time I can do a 10-minute workout or if
I really want to get in a workout I can
do like an hour-long one stuff like that
I'm gonna soar that really awesome way
just because I like having someone to
push me to do my work
I like someone instructing me but I also
don't like having to go to a gym so it's
cut to me it's kind of like having a
personal trainer at home or a personal
trainer wherever you go but that's
really it for my diet and exercise
routine it's pretty simple get your
daily fruits and veggies drink a lot of
water have a good mindset and just work
out how you feel like working out don't
feel like you have to kill yourself
every single day so I love you guys very
much I hope you enjoyed this video if
you did please give it a big thumbs up

warms up it's a little too cold for me

film it outside and it's like 30 degrees
