obsessed with this stuff they did I will
be honest with you guys they did reach
out to me and send me all these products

these are all very natural skincare it's
really good to have natural products so
many products you use nowadays have like
really bad ingredients it's there's some
youtuber I fall off camera who was
trying rumor linker down below we talked
about all the different ingredients we
don't realize are in like different
products like that are actually really
bad for your skin and can do more harm
than good and it's supposed to be like
skin care I've gotten lots of
compliments on my skin lately I'm
actually not wearing any foundation

have tons of breakouts my skin's been
very clear first I'm going in with my
art natural skincare clarifying a face

have the art Naturals serums I have
three of them there's a retinol retinol
the hyaluronic and the vitamin C each
one is something different this one's
for moisturizing ones for age defying
