of these Urban Decay cosmetics all you

below and three leave any kind of
comment and I'll pick a winner down
below okay so I just washed off all of
my makeup I'm not sure why I keep
smacking my face and put my hair up and
a little ponytail I don't have any
extensions in today like I said no
makeup obviously limited a like today
you don't need any obviously you know
girl your name me any day so I'm so
excited for today because I love love
love like grooming type days no is it
work so it's like a good day just do all
of my girly stuff ribbon that good
hygiene it leads to a good mental health
so I think when you like pamper yourself
it kind of like nourishes your soul you
know makes you feel good on the inside
but doesn't matter what anyone else
thinks if it makes you feel good girls
do it so for my brows I am going to
using one of my soaked touch-up
razors I love these so much they did
actually reach out to partner with me on
this video but I'm so excited because I
really do love these they are a great
affordable multi-use beauty tool now you
can use these for removing fine hair
exfoliating for smooth skin and also to
shave your eyebrows these are also
extremely gentle on your skin it don't
cause any irritation it's also great
because you felt really confident
knowing that Schick provides high
quality blades so I'm just removing some
of the fine here above my eyebrows a
little bit of the eyebrow here as well
now they do also come with another
little attachment that you can slide
right on top of the blade and this is
great for a precision or precise eyebrow
shaping and I'm just gonna go right into
my eyebrows just like the little hairs
under here and I'm gonna clean those up
my brows awkward completely clean no
little excess baby hair so we're like
little scraggly hairs so as you can see
the Schick silk touch up razors are
extremely easy to use they're trimly
affordable and the thing is they are so
tiny and little and cute you can fit
these in your purse and just take them
around with you for anything you might
need it was actually almost at a meeting
the other day and I was looking and my
little like car mirror and the parking
lot and I was like oh my gosh I had like
eyebrow hairs everywhere it was not cute
I was like they're just gonna be staring
at my eyebrow hairs all day but I was
like oh no no because I have one of my
silk touch-up razors and my purse pulled
one out seeing my eyebrows up no it's
good to go they are super amazing
quality and a great price and once you
try them you will not want to ever go
without them again so I'll have the
links down below I'm going to do some
face masks I have never sat at my desk
do this by the lighting my bathroom
literally sucks so oh it is yellow and
I've got to glam glow ones I have the
firming treatment and the clearing
treatment I'm broken out it's actually
that time of the month
so it's pretty normal for me to get like
acne where is that right now mmm smells
really good okay so I just rinse the
mask off my face is so red
I don't member if it's always this red
when I take it off I don't know we
doesn't hurt just feels really right I
should stop touching it - I like
questions everyone always asks my hair
color is well color tango six rrv so
this is the exact color that I use on my
hair this is the only color I've ever
used the first I am adding my color into
my bowl one little like glob of the
color brilliance or whatever this is
called the red hot intensifier and
you're supposed to do equal parts color
in equal parts developer I honestly just
kind of eye it but I just try to make
sure it looks about equal I think so my
hair is now section and I'm just going
to get straight to coloring it I like to
start at the bottom section or a lower
section I'm not the most precise I'm not
the most and meet with this I just kind
of go for it
no was I giving not humming use it on
have the shower fresh clean and the
squeaky okay so I'm gonna take my towel
off and like zoom you guys in so don't
be looking at none of my parts up close
and this is a very unattractive angle
right now but I'm going to be
self-tanning this is my Lovington I've
actually never used the to our Express
before I usually use the regular one but
I thought I would try the two hour
Express because that means I don't have
to sleep in my self-tanner robe I
literally have a row that I sleep in
whenever I self tan so I don't like
stain my sheets and it's 90 degrees out
and I don't want to sleep in that hot AF
robe so let's try this out and see if I
can run it south before I go to sleep
now that I got my self tanner oil on I
got my my oh that was lame alright it's
covered in the red hair dye this is my
towel we always know which one's mine
cuz that's Orange I'm gonna real quick
just the brush on my hair this is my Ava
NYC Maine magic ten-in-one primer I
don't know I've had this for five
million years don't know where I got it
but it works I just put it in my hair
after I wash it especially after I just
um Tarn it it's got a argan oil and all
good stuff I'm just gonna brush out my
little bits of hair
alright I'm gonna paint my nails I'm
just using this little like kind of like
a grayish nude color it's a shade
checkmate
Wow I don't even know who I am I feel
like a year ago I was only wearing like
bright pink and neon blues and greens
and stuff but here I am
you know 25 this is it but I like to
have my nails at home cuz I don't like I
really don't like going to the nail
salon I don't know what it is about it I
just never feel comfortable so I always
just do my nails at home and I'm
actually going to watch Princess Diaries

never seen the second one

pretzel chips in a little bit more guac

ice cream till the movie's over it was

teeth as well I usually use white strips
but I'm all out I do have this natural
teeth whitening powder I showed you in
my night routine I've only tried a few
times and Noah thinks he's seen a
difference I'm not 100% sure yet but no
