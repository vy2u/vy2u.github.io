remember telling my parents I were
telling my brother I remember showing
people pictures my friends so excited
and I remember telling my dad that you
were like Prince Charming and even
though he told me that you reminded him
of someone he knew that was an alcoholic
I didn't care I thought he's just being
a dad he's just worrying to me I thought
you were perfect you were beautiful and
you always wanted to be around you you
came over so often and you were so
attentive and you really loved to be
around me and it showed right and then
my phone would ring or my mom would
check in and who are you texting who are
you talking to and put that phone down
because when you were around I should be
a good girlfriend and I should pay
attention to you before he knew it I
couldn't pick up the phone without my
phone being thrown across the room and I
thought oh he just cares he just wants
me to pay attention to him he's just
really needy and I thought that that
might be okay
I became isolated and I hardly spoke to
my mom or my friends or my family but
when I did I told them things were great
I tell you about my goals or my dreams
and my hopes and things that I want to
do with my life and no that wasn't okay
I mean I guess it didn't help that we
were a few years apart and you seemed to
slowly look at me and the child try to
talk to you about my goals and my job
and my future and my hopes and every
time it just stopped talking stop
talking stop stop talking nobody wants
to hear you talk I don't know why you're
talking about gold and a job honey
you're a female you're such a child
you're so childish and I'm going to take
care of you that's why you need a man in
your life you need a man you should stay
home and even to take care of children
do what women do you need me so I
decided to make the conversation
about you how was your day how was this
how was that do you wanna watch
something on TV when you started telling
me about your job it was a little
complicated you know you're higher up
and him in a business I didn't
understand so tell me about it no you're
stupid you'd understand anything I told
you you want to get it
why do you care go sit in your room play
with your dogs watch your TV shows I'll
let you know if I need you but right now
I don't you had to start working later
you started bringing home alcohol
usually beer six packs twelve packs I
didn't think anything of it at first I
didn't think to ask or the question I
thought okay maybe this is normal you
started to take control and I let you
you started telling me how to eat how to
dress when to speak and what to speak
about you fell asleep on the couch that
night and to be honest I was relieved
the next morning I woke up and who'd
peed on yourself and you'd thrown up on
the floor and I realized you might have
some sort of an issue but you assured me
no that's normal it's okay it's not
gonna happen again the next night you
brought home another case of beer so
when you started drinking I said hey
maybe you should slow down take a break
so what you don't have a drink all of
them tried to make it light-hearted
wasn't a light-hearted situation I woke
up the next morning with bruises and I
remember looking at myself in the mirror
thinking I have bruises I were taking
out my concealer and realizing this
isn't gonna cover all this up I guess I
shouldn't be filming any videos right
now I guess I it's a good thing I don't
hang out with anyone anymore I guess
it's a good thing I have no more friends
I guess it's a good thing my mom doesn't
come to see me anymore because I blow
her off every time she asks that day you
brought home a big vase of flowers and
they were beautiful they were so pretty
right you brought that into my room you
sat next to me and said I am so sorry
you are so beautiful
and I need you in my life you don't
understand the things I've been through
and you know you need me too because you
know you're a small little girl the
world is tough and you need someone to
take care of you and I'm not going to do
that again
I promise I will never hurt you like
that but you need me and I need you
you're my person I love you I still knew
at the moment that wasn't love and that
I didn't love him because I didn't know
him and he didn't know me because people
that used to know me knew that I like to
talk and I talk a lot and I talk too
fast and the next time it happened I had
a few extra bruises and that time he
brought me a cookie cake the time that
after that probably a few more bruises
and that time you brought me an
expensive bottle of perfume I think I
made excuses I made excuses for you
because I knew that I'd had a rough life
and apparently you had and maybe maybe
you would get better and maybe I could
help by not speaking by just being there
I don't know I'm I'm not sure what I
thought was gonna happen I'm not sure if
I thought we were gonna end up happily
ever after someone was gonna end up dead
like a Lifetime movie I think well
thankfully neither I didn't have to go
to either of those and everyone knows
how I am with animals that's all I
needed
that's all I needed to see you came home
one day my dog was in your way and
you're mad after work and you're just
poor you walked in the door pouring a
beer down your throat one already empty
you must have drink in your car on the
way home and I knew this was gonna be a
bad night so I tried to grab my dogs or
one run to my room and you were like
what are you doing why are you my way
I'm a big smack here and a big yell
there and a big push here and during
that time I dropped with my dogs and she
got under your feet and you took out
your anger on her I picked up my dog and
I ran into the room and we locked the
door and I remember thinking what is my
life and that's when that beautiful
bubble that I thought I was in popped
and I realized the flowers you brought
me for dead and ugly the cookie cake he
brought me was Ryan that perfume
probably smells terrible and you weren't
beautiful and you weren't prince
charming you were ugly and sour and mean
and I was bruised and broken into sad
and pathetic
I looked at my dog looking at me like
scared a little probably hurt and I
realized it's time to take control of
this I remember telling you that I would
do whatever it took to get you out and
you told me you would do whatever it
took to stay that weekend every time I
came out you grabbed me by my arm or
grabbed me by my hair grabbed my red
shirt like why are you so afraid of me
you know you're only scared of me
because you won't shut up if you would
just be smart and calm down none of this
would happen and I would cower in fear
and look up at you like a lost dog or a
bird and open cage and I could just run
to the door and I would just hope and
pray that you would leave me alone
Sunday night maybe you got lonely maybe
you were tired maybe your hormones are
taking over I don't know
I remember you knocked on my door of
course it was locked you said hey can
you let me in for a minute but I just
want to talk to you I promise to have
something nice to say and I was I
shouldn't have opened I bought it I
guess I thought like you were gonna be
nice maybe you were leaving maybe you
realize you know so I open my door and
you were standing there naked he would
taken all of your clothes off and you
were standing in my bedroom doorway with
nothing on and I remember thinking how
gross you were and how the sight of you
disgusted me and how I was so happy that
I wasn't like mesmerised that you wanted
my attention and then I was so over this
like facade that I'd given myself and I
was like what are you doing why what are
you doing and I was scared I was
honestly thinking of the worse it was
gonna happen and you just sat down on my
bed no clothes and said listen I'm a man
and I have needs in my life and I need
you to understand those things and I
need you to want me like I want you all
I need is for you to be quiet and calm
and not talk and be a normal human being
if you were to be a normal human being
nothing would happen you could stay at
home take care of children one day and I
would work all I need you to do is just
realize my entire body could be yours I
could be yours if you can just learn you
can let me take care of you
and I lost it I started screaming and
yelling and screaming at the top of my
lungs to get out of my house and I
realized right then that you were a
coward all those threats of you know I'm
not gonna let you leave I can kill you
I'm Way bigger than you I can hurt you
you can't hurt me I realized all those
threats they were empty because my
screams were all it took I'm sure the
neighbors heard maybe you're afraid of
the cops being called it took me five
minutes me to get your clothes on and
get out you were scared
and I hope I hope you were still scared
and I spent weeks months trying to move
on trying to get better trying to stop
look over my looking over my shoulder
when I went to the grocery store trying
to feel whole again but I finally
realized there's nothing there for me I
couldn't live in that house I couldn't
lay in that bedroom I couldn't look at
the couch I couldn't look at any of the
furniture so I packed up my stuff I
moved to a new state
I sold all of my furniture and got all
this stuff that you hadn't touched so
this is my story I'm sorry I didn't go
into as much detail some of you might
have liked I know I could have separated
into multiples like story time videos
and gave me more details but it's
probably the most details that I could
let myself give I hope you guys enjoyed
this I didn't know how to tell this
video I tried talking about it in story
time videos and sitting down and filming
nothing felt right this felt a little
bit more right I wasn't even planning to
filming to film tonight I was sitting on
my couch wasn't ready to film while
eating cupcakes and I saw something it
reminded me of you and not you not you
and him and I decided it's time for me
to sit down and tell anyone you know was
in some kind of situation maybe share
this video maybe it'll help someone out
there people should know that if you're
in a situation like this you are not a
caged bird you can get out of it it
might be harder than others but you can
fight and you deserve to fight because
you deserve to not be in a situation
where someone makes you feel weak or not
not good enough or ugly you never
deserve for someone put their hands on
you I love you guys very much and I'm
very proud
sad I don't even even sad tears I think
they're happy tears I love you very much
