Chinese food always better the next day
I feel like this shot ten times younger
since yesterday
anyways hello guys and I'll open back or
welcome if you happen to be new today's
video is going to be my night routine I
actually was watching some night
routines last night because I realized I
haven't filmed the night routine in
almost two years on my channel I don't
know where the time has gone and
honestly my last night routine was back
when I was trying way too hard to be
like other youtubers I really wasn't
myself on my channel about a year and a
half ago two years ago and to be
completely honest I don't have like a
real night routine it kind of changes
every single night so this is kind of a
good way for you guys just to follow me
around see what I'm doing this specific
night and go from there but anyways I'm
gonna finish this Chinese food and we'll
continue on
oh now that I am greatly out of breath
by the way in case you guys are
wondering I am typically the most the
messiest person ever but lately I think
I was watching another youtuber who said
something about how a messy house leads
to a messy mind which makes so much
sense because I'm the most I can become
a very anxious stressed out person I'm
literally out of breath from all that
dancing and don't say you don't do that
we all do that right hopefully hopefully
we all do this I just have to get myself
started and once I get started I turn on
my music I'm having fun so I've been
trying to make sure I keep the house
clean almost every single day look about
how I've had on all the time obviously I
won't worry about it that day but
Jason's had a lot of time I was like you
know what let's set a timer let's get as
much as I can in like 10-15 minutes done
and it looks really good so now it's
time to get out of these uncomfortable
clothes and put on my PJs
okay so I'm currently doing my to-do
list for tomorrow and that's simply
because honestly I'll just be completely
honest in real feminine I've been
getting really stressed out lately and
it's hard because you guys keep wanting
me to do more of my like positive
content in my like motivational content
which is my favorite content to film but
I always feel like I can't put out those
videos unless I am acting that way and
the past week or two I have just been
very anxious it's had a few paint
attacks I've got a feel like crying
attack something I'm human
it happens I'm working on obviously I
think I just got a little bit a little
bit of the swing of things with the new
year and that's traveling I wasn't
meditating you're enough and so I've
been really reading a bunch of books and
getting myself back to where I need to
be like following all my self-help books
which I promise you guys those things I
telling you I actually do them because
it doesn't work for me and it's bad it's
ahem it's bad the way my mind works
sometimes if I notice I just get it out
on paper and get it out of my head I
started to calm down and relax and
besides a to-do list what I like to do
under that is I like to write down
everything I'm grateful for I've told
you guys before why don't I have a whole
list of things I do every day but you
know meditating visualizing one of them
is running down my things I'm grateful
for every single day very grateful for a
fiance who loves me hold me when I'm
stressed makes me feel safe and is
always there to support me even like
saying that reminds me like how lucky I
am to have someone who loves me that
much and instantly my mood go somewhere
ever that is to just a little bit higher
I instantly feel better
number two I'm grateful to have a job
where this is my job I'm a living
do you Milwaukee other night reminds me
how lucky I am
like that today I am literally filming
myself doing everyday daily tasks and
that is my job
like I can't I like I makes me remind
myself like how lucky I am and why when
I complain it's like what do I have to
complain about you know with my amazing
subscribers that allows me such a
beautiful abundant life I see now I feel
like 10 times better first off I love
you guys whoever you are watching this I
love you and number three I'm grateful
but I really wouldn't be again I'm just
so glad I finally went for and stopped
caring people think it's just in my life
I have many people who have I've heard
my mouth who've expressed me that they
don't like veganism or they think that
being vegan is stupid I've had many
people tell me that for my family to
friends it's always kind of worry about
it and I finally realized like I'm not
living for them I'm living for me and it
makes me feel so good so again hearing
my third one I'm so proud that I finally
did it and did something for me and I
feel so good about it now I'm like happy
- you're crying right now
so right three things you're grateful
for every night make them relevant don't
make them specific it make it feel good
you know
I'm finish writing my down and now that
I have done my to do this I'm gonna let
that also look like kind of soak in and
I'm going to meditate I tend to actually
meditate twice a day now I used to just
meditate in the morning now I do instead
of doing like one 20-minute annotation I
do a ten minute in the morning and a
10-minute one towards the end of the day
I used to be someone who doesn't did
sleep very well at night I had a lot of
issues long asleep and I suffered with a
lot of like restlessness and I usually
just even six months goes by I'm
probably three months ago I would stamps
like 2 or 3 a.m. sometimes does not
being able to fall asleep and since I
started meditating late in the day as
well it definitely makes it where I fall
asleep as soon as almost as soon as I
lay down so try that out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
