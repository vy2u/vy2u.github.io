back to my channel today's video is my
room tour my room has changed so much
since I last City room tour so I felt
like I just had to do it like i did a
room tour and an apartment tour before
if you haven't seen my apartment tour
you should go watch that will link that
down below and if you want to see how my
room took my room used to look I will
also link that down below ok enough
talking if you guys want to see my room
in my room tour then let's go ahead and
get started alright guys so here is a
quick overview of my room and now just
take you spot by spot they first walk
into my room you have my door obviously
and then you move down my wall and you
have the door that leads to my bathroom
and the first little thing you see in my
room is this little corner right here ok
so this little photo right here
something i did in a DIY very recently
this is a DIY galaxy chalkboard like i
said i did do this in a DIY that i can
link down below if you haven't seen it
and then moving over here i also have to
little wall art things that i also made
in a DIY room decor the same one as this
and then you come here and you have my
bedside table or like my nightstand and
it is a wood nice in with a marble top I
love it it is from West down right here
I have this little jewelry Sam but
really holds like random stuff like a
little phone charger a getting a liner
for my candle random jewelry and then I
had this little marble vase with a fake
plant in it that I did make in a DIY as
well then you come to a candle in my bed
I always have to have some sort of
candle and then i have my lamp which is
also from west elm then you move on from
but my bedside table over into my bed ok
so first these are my sheiks si GE x and
these are sheets that will change the
way you sleep now a lot of you might
know because i mentioned in videos
before but i have incredible lee
terrible night sweats I sweat a lot when
I sleep I get really hot when I'm
sleeping so first off it they keep you
incredibly cool because they don't trap
body heat like it's made out of a
different fabric it doesn't trap your
body heat like cotton does and next they
are the softest material you will ever
lay on like these are literally
incredibly soft I can't even explain it
to you you would have to feel them on
your own too
and they are that soft so yeah I just
want to show you these because they were
a gift but it has changed the way that I
sleep I sleep incredible used to have
really bad sleep and now I just want to
show you this in case any of you out
there are you know have the same thing
or interested in these i will link these
down below again these are sheiks sh ee
x okay so starting from the top i first
have my tapestry that i got from dorma
phi which is a website that has lots of
cool like room decor and stuff and then
i have my string light to go along my
wall and above the word sunshine go on
to my pillows my first two pillows are
from west elm and then my black pillows
back there are my sheiks pillows again
and then i just have a bunch of
decorative pillows right here at front
all of those are also from dorm afon in
my comforter is from kate spade and then
this blanket right here is also from
west elm and then my entire bed itself
with the entire bed frame is also from
west on and then moving along you come
to my next bedside table which matches
the one over there this is my sad keanu
reeves 3d printed figure I got this from
shapeways if you haven't tried out
Shapeways yet you are missing out so it
is the world's largest 3d printing
service so basically users can like
design something using this 3d modeling
software uploaded to their website and
they will print and ship you your
product people make things such as a
means funny little like emojis and
everything everyone thinks it's
hilarious and they come over and you
just see him there like he just sits on
my lamp moving over from my desk you
have my big window I actually have
Juliet balconies and I will show you
what my view is outside okay so now this
is the view outside of my window I live
in Avalon and you can just see all the
apartments across the street and in the
shopping center that is below it so let
me go over from my balcony over to this
side of my room and this is where you
see my little doggy great I don't know
why she's sitting in there she's
literally never in there and then moving
on to the front of my room what you have
my desk space so my chair and my desk
are both from west elm so are the two
pictures on my wall as well as the
calendar first I have these little donut
coasters that I made myself then you
move over to this little tree thing i
have i'm not sure if it's for hanging
jewelry but i will just like randomly
hang like little pony tails and random
jewelry on it but i'm not sure if it's
actually for that but that's okay and
then I just have a candle
and then I had this cute little picture
frame and here is my next shape way
little figurine how cute is my grumpy
cat ok so again this is like a 3d
printed figure I just went on the
website and I bought and they shipped it
to me but people can make these or
customizing their selves but look at
this little guy but if you like memes
and emojis and just like fun stuff for
your desk you would love this website I
literally am obsessed so that is my full
desk area and then last but not least I
will move over here to my mirror this is
also from west elm and that is
everything in my room because then you
just come straight back here to my door
