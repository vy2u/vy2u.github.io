his video is my room tour and again I
wanted to do it a little bit vlog style
just because girl she is grouchy to
Daini
because why not um like you a little bit
him like I said in my last video I did
move to a new state liking it so far so
good so far so good one of those um but
yeah my room here is a little small so I
didn't know if I should do a room tour
but why not alright so from my bathroom
we go in this way and here is my bedroom
do the first thing in my room obviously
is my door and then on both sides of my
door I have a closet on both sides which
I really like
now my bed itself is from West Elm and
then on top I had this white comforter
from Kate Spade and then I have a purple
comforter on top for when I get extra
cold or just because it looks cute
that's also from Kate Spade and then I
have this really pretty blanket up here
that is from West Elm so here are my
pillows I just have the two purple
pillows that match my comforter done
here I have this hella beautiful pillow
and then this funky one back here I got
them from Ohno Dorma I got them
from dorm Fi and then I have this cute L
pillow that I got from Avalon and like a
little boutique and then I have this
white pillow back here and I don't know
where it's from and then up here I just
have my Christmas lights
I just realized these are uneven I'll
fix that later it's alright and then I
just got those from Walmart like 2 bucks
and then I have my arrow up top which is
from Hobby Lobby hang on from my bed on
this side I have these two photos I got
these from Hobby Lobby I really like
them cuz they're colorful I think they
look good in the back of my videos been
on this side of my room you come to my
other nightstand and this one looks a
lot better because there's not a box
over there so my nightstands are also
from West Elm and they are wood and then
up here they are marble which I really
really love I think it's really pretty
and then my lamps are also from West um
and we have my dresser now let me just
tell you my dresser also got really
scratched up in the move my dresser is
not really dusty it is just scratched up
