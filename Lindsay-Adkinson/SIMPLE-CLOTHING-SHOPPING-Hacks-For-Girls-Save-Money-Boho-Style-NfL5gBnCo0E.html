or welcome if you are new my name is
Linda meringue today's video is going to
be a quick little video telling you how
I buy clothes that are very bold style
without spending tons of money and three
people show me your muumuu for love and
lemons and how I actually sometimes buy
those items would save a good bit of
money on them it's like all the time I
feel you guys think that I have like all
this money and stuff for clothes and I'm
like I don't know where you got that
from because proper 21 thrift store also
rational as you think these are actually
from Tilly's but I got off like two
bucks
number one is I obviously shop the sale
racks if I go in the stores especially
the Urban Outfitters I stick to the
Sailor racks and they also sign up for
newsletters for all of them because
usually you will get emails that will
tell you when they're having sales and
that's when I shop there I usually don't
go in these stores unless they're having
sales or unless I'm going to a sale rack
because I just don't have the money to
spend $400 I for love and lemons on one
item and honestly so many times I've
seen something I wanted it Urban
Outfitters
didn't buy it is too expensive and like
a week later it'll be able to sale rack
and even just from signing up for a
newsletter I got email one week that
Urban Outfitters has 50% off all of
their dresses and offers so I went in
and got a dress that was originally like
I think it was like 50 something which
is still not too bad but I still I'm a
Tebow and I got over like 24 and I'll
say wine save money and literally just
put me in the best mood like I just just
saving money it's like yeah that is
saving money save money to me is like
three money on a few item it's like a
half off vintage property notes or books
you know number two is looking at their
photos online for inspiration so what I
like to do is I go to free people for
love and lemons
show me your movie so me your muumuu I
look on their instagrams and their
websites because you should be able post
like lookbook style photos and what I
will do is I will take those photos and
stays in my phone or something
so I'm shopping at other places like
forever 21 even I can look at their
photos of how they style their outfits
and that gives me inspiration for when
I'm shopping at cheaper places and when
I'm just pairing items from my own
closet number
three is remembering the patterns and
materials that you like from these
stores so for example when I go on three
people I love their fringe when I go on
for love and lemons I love love love
their lace and then when I go interpret
to show me your moon I love their
pattern so usually I won't look at other
places for similar fringe or similar
patterns similar lace type details for
an example I was in love with the lemon
pattern at show me your muumuu and I
also think I've seen it a few other
places as well but I was in love with
her living patterns but I found one
dress is there there's like $400 I'm
like okay I cannot afford that obviously
so I went online and searched for lemon
pattern shorts women patterned dress
such so all that type of stuff and I
found lemon pattern shorts that looked
very similar at forever 21 for $8.00 and
I also found a lemon pattern dress on
the pool for 10 bucks and they're so
cute and I saved so much money which
leads me to my next one which is also
checking sites like H&amp;amp;M forever 21 fast
fashion stores wholesale stores online
websites and just search for the items
that you see on their websites somewhere
else and see if you can find similar
items or look-alike another idea is
shopping resale now puns of people
donate their clothes you can go to
Goodwill good old Buffalo Exchange
Poshmark that's an app deep pops also an
app you can check eBay tons of people
buy these items and resell them for half
the price so that is a really good way
to get these exact items you want and if
all new Phillipsburg care of them it's
not your I'm going to know usually the
qua quality is still pretty much the
same and last but not least is checking
other places that already sell these
brands instead of just going into their
store for example Macy's Nordstrom
Nordstrom Rack sacks office
Bloomingdale's
all these stores usually sell the same
they sell for people brand show me your
muumuu brand you know they sell for love
and lemon but they sell them at a lot
cheaper price sometimes or they will
have sales that you might not find
inside the actual store for example a
good one is Nordstrom Rack
so Nordstrom Rack takes clothes that
didn't sell at Nordstrom which includes
things like free people and stuff and
they sell in Nordstrom Rack for like way
more discounted and you save so much
money my thumb's are free people I've
gotten so many items for like $15 or
like
box that are originally like a hundred
or more and it saves me so much money so
check other places that also sell their
clothes ok guys so that is how I buy all
these bowls out clothing clothing brains
without actually going to their store
and spending tons of money or how I just
gets a similar look I think my favorite
one is honestly just looking at their
pictures I had follow all their
instagrams and look at their look books
and I just wittily look at my claws and
saying okay how can I make this outfit
from what I have in here that's my
favorite favorite thing to do so you can
do it too I promise I love you guys very
much make sure if you like this video -
