why are you leaf blowing at five o'clock
in the afternoon I am trying the green
tea frappe for the first time ever and I
don't know if I like it or if I like it
dude hi guys welcome back to my channel
today I'm doing a haul video for you
guys it is getting really hot here in
Georgia and summer is upon us thankfully
and also I just turned 22 so I got a
bunch of gift cards and saw so I've done
a little bit of shopping now one of the
first places I went was American threads
Tracy Foster's mom got me a gift card
there for my birthday which is really
awesome
now I have an American threads right out
my door here at Avalon I can actually
walk there now if you don't know what
American threads is it's kind of like
Free People but you didn't know this
it's a little bit cheaper so it's a good
bit cheaper so if you're someone who
really likes free people's clothes but
can't really afford them I'm like me
American threads is a lot less expensive
anyways so the first thing I got from
there was this really cute cardigan
slash kimono slash thing are they
cardigans or are they kimonos I don't
really is it I think it's like a
cardigan so like sweaters but kimonos
are these aren't really kimonos what do
you call these let me know so this is
just like a white cardigan some kimono
thing it's got really pretty fringe at
the bottom it's got really big sleeves I
don't really have anything like this so
I really needed this this is good to
throw over a crop top it's good for like
dresses it's good for kind of anything
the second thing I got from making
threads this is really cute denim
button-up shirt it's a short sleeve
shirt now it's a little bit too big they
didn't have a small but I still really
wanted it so what I plan to do is maybe
like tie it at the bottom which would be
really cute and then also a parent with
like a bando or a bralette but you know
why I think it's cute it's so fits me
pretty well it's just a little bit
bigger but I think with a bra let this
would be really cute and this is like
the softest shirt I've ever touched in
my life now the last thing I guys this
really really really cute floral crop
top I probably wear this with like a
really high waisted skirt or
high-waisted shorts but it's really cute
I don't know if you can tell but it like
wraps around you in the front it looks
like it's really low-cut but it's not
because this like comes up onto like
your chest area I probably would also
wear like a bando underneath this
this would be really cute I'm probably
with my cardigan with really
high-waisted shorts a high-waisted skirt
I just think this is really cute and it
looks really cute online so I got it
see you next place Thailand is forever
21 Foster's mom also got me like a visa
type gift card which you can spin
anywhere so you all know I had to go
forever 21 now the first thing you got
from forever 21
are these high-waisted denim shorts I
realized when I got that floor crop top
I don't have that many high-waisted
shorts I need a new pair of shorts
anyways so I got these they're really
cute then I'm kind of acid washed with
like a ripped at the bottom and they're
high-waisted and these were like 17
dollars really inexpensive I love
forever 21 because of that and they were
really cute so boom there's that I also
got this crop top is I was looking for
things to pair with my new like kimono
cardigan thing and this is just a little
blue crop top this would look really
good under like anything I can also wear
this underneath that new denim shirt I
got it's just a crop top that I can pair
with kind of anything I like the blue
like light wash blue color and this is
only $7 so rusted stuff I got from
forever 21 is jewelry because I really
think getting into like the layering
necklaces kind of thing but I don't have
like any of that kind of jewelry on my
own now people forever 21 let me just
say did a terrible job of putting this
in a bag it's all messed up and tangled
oh my gosh
hold on guys spatula first necklace
looks like this it has like a little
choker at the top and then it has a
really simple necklace and then it has
one with a little like Sun type pendant
and then at the end it has like a little
Arrowhead at the bottom I'm not sure if
you can really see that but I'll show
you
I just got two chokers from forever21
because I don't really have any chokers
anymore I had like a million but I've
lost all of them so I just got these two
that came together any last I got this
other layered necklace from forever 21
as well it starts off with this really
cute like little triangle necklace and
then can you see that and below that it
has this really cute little stone and it
ends with this crystal which i think is
so cute next I got two things from the
website called tushy inside I only have
two things because I've never really
shopped there and I haven't done a lot
of like online wholesale shopping so I
was kind of nervous by jitka two things
the first shirt I got was this white
crochet top it's actually inside out but
it looks the same when it's not inside
out so just a white crochet top but it's
got like a little lining here so no
one's gonna see through it but this is
extremely cute on and then I also got
this over the shoulder crochet top as
well but it's like floral pattern
instead and this is really really cute
with like colorful jeans another place I
shopped at was fashion Nova cart now
this is not like a wholesale shop that's
just a regular online clothing store the
first thing I got were these really cute
like neon green shorts these are so cute
I don't have anything like this so I was
really excited to get these and then I
also got this dropper that I actually
wore for my birthday and it's white and
like kind of crocheted at the top and
then it has the black bottom for the end
of the romper it kind of looks like a
skirt because it's really frilly but it
is like the shorts and the top and it is
backless which made me a little nervous
but it's really cute oh it has a built
in bra which is I know that's a little
random but just so you know cuz things
like this I don't know I'm always
nervous like how do you wear that but it
does have a built-in bra so you're like
you're good to go and from fashion oh
but I also got two tank tops they are
both the same but just different colors
I got a blue tank top and it's got like
a floral pocket and then floral lining
on the tank top as well I thought that
was really cute really simple and then I
also just got the same tank top as well
but in pink and then I bosses mom got me
two tank tops from Kohl's and these are
extremely cute so first is this like
black kind of crochet top it's got a few
little crochet places I'm gonna be can
kind of see where like it's got like a
little meant to be holes they're so cute
this is really cute I love like the
backing of it it's gotta go back like
this so it's it's like a racer back
there
and then also from Kohl's Fosters not
got me this top as well it's another
cute tank top but it's got a really cute
cutout I love shirts with like cutouts
like that in the bag just add something
a little extra and then the bottom has a
really pretty like watercolor floral
pattern I love watercolor print anything
so I really love this top and the next
place I got some stuff was from Wet Seal
I don't shop there too often but they
were having like a buy one get one free
shirt so obviously I had to go get a
shirt and get one free so the first one
I got was this really cute tank top it's
just a really pretty blue color this is
actually the color of my wall in my
living room so I thought I you know kind
of needed it and then my second sure if
I might steal this is the one I got for
free
is this light washed pink t-shirt this
is so soft I pretty much got it because
of how soft it is but I really like the
light wash color of the pink and the
white Pocky I think this is really cute
