Birkenstocks they're so easy to slip on
and off they're cute they're trendy and
they don't get super hot in the Sun so
they don't burn your toes like normal
football my second favorite is my del
Sol transition nail polish basically
this changes colors in the heat so it'll
be one color when I'm inside or in the
cool water but then when I get out and
I'm in the heat my nail polish changes
colors and how cool is that I don't know
about you but my summer wardrobe is not
complete without high-waisted denim
shorts I have to have them every summer
especially when they're cut off I love
them so much another staple piece for me
is my kimono or throw over I wear a lot
of crop tops and swimsuits obviously at
the beach so these are cute just to
throw over when you're going out
somewhere and also I love my floppy hats
they protect your face and they are
probably the cutest accessory in the
summertime you need one and last but not
least when it comes to wardrobe I have
to have mirrored aviators I think
they're so cute and everyone needs a
pair of these okay I love going for that
summer sunkissed kind of hair look so I
always buy some in every single year and
I just worked it through my hair when
I'm out in the Sun and it just slightly
lightened your hair a little bit more
and I just think it's funny
expensive I also have to have really
nice summer day
Tahiti Islanders is my favorite right
now it's at bathroom at environment my
next essential is a cute tumblr Cup this
one says don't forget to be awesome
how perfect is that and last but not
least is lip balm I love my part lip
balm because it doesn't really know as
it's done in its like delicious and
moisturizing so you need some thank you
