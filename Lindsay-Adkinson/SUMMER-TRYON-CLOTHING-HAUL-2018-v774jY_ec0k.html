let you guys know my channel will be
going back to what it originally was
which is fashion beauty and lifestyle
content I really trying to push the
motivational self-help type stuff and
honestly wasn't doing very well you guys
did not seem to enjoy it like you
enjoyed my previous content will still
be sprinkling it in in my own content
and also I am starting a motivational
podcast very very soon make sure you are
following me on Instagram I will have it
linked down below because that is where
I will be announcing it and giving all
the details of where you can listen to
my podcast very very soon so first for
my whole I did get some stuff from
fashion OVA surprise surprise have I
ever have I ever in the history of my
channel done a haul where I didn't have
stuff from fashion OVA I don't think so
the first thing I got was this really
cute like turquoise e blue two-piece set
it's kind of just 42 piece set except
for it's a skirt so you can't wear it
for sporty stuff but it looks kind of
sporty I don't know I actually saw
Amanda in sing wearing and I thought it
looked so cute and I was like I need
that I need that oh next I got another
two pieces one looks kind of like a
Tommy Hilfiger set um but so a little
sad because I actually left the pants in
Miami on my trip however I did call and
they are mailing the pants back to me I
will insert a picture of what it looks
like with the pants but I didn't have
the pants for the trial but I also got
this really cute romper from fashion OVA
I love this it's such a simple but
really stunning good night out romper I
actually wore this again on my Miami
trip oh my and I also got this hat I'm
trying to like get back into like
accessories now that I have my
extensions and I don't know what do you
guys think I never really wear hats it
looks big on camera but it's not that
big in real life I don't know I also got
a few things from beginning boutique
actually found them on Instagram and I
thought they had some really really cute
stuff so I was excited to try them out
and the first thing I got was this skirt
right here oh my god does not zipped up
right here but you'll see the try on
this is so cool I feel like it's very
like fun and edgy and like I don't know
I love this I also got this little black
crop top from there and it's so cool
because it's not just a simple black
crop top it also laces up in the back
and I love like simple tops to have
something a little extra added onto and
at last the beginning boutique I got
this polka-dotted wrap dress um this is
really really cute online and I do like
it in person but it is really confusing
on how to like tie the dress I kind of
feel like I wish it came with
instructions I think I have it on
properly I think I hope I got it on
right I feel like this would be really
cute when we go on our honeymoon in
Venice so that's why I actually got this
I feel like it's really really cute
there and I got some stuff from a little
Shoetique I used some get stuff from
them all at the time so I was excited to
like try their stuff out again cuz it
has been a while first I got this little
bitty red crop top I don't I don't know
what it is but for a long time I thought
I couldn't wear red because my hair was
red I thought like if I wore red then it
would make my hair look orange and
contrast but I recently realized that is
not true so I got this little red crop
top I feel like red is a really in color
this summer there's a lot of red stuff I
also got this silver sparkly swimsuit
from there this isn't cool look swimsuit
I've ever seen in my life I did wear
this in Miami for a really fun photo I'm
not sure if it's on my Instagram yet you
have to go check I also got a pair of
these track bands I've seen a lot of
people pairing like track pants with
heels lately and that's kind of what I
want to go forward this but they're
really heavy so maybe these would be
more of like a fall and winter pant I
don't know if I could wear them in the
Ohio Heat it doesn't get really hot and
humid here in the summer so I might save
these for the fall because they are
really cute I just don't know if they're
gonna work for summer I also got this a
really fun 2-piece set it's like a
really pretty lavender set really cute
shorts and it comes with a purple blazer
with these little like fake pearls all
over such a finest set I also got a
backpack from there I actually use this
so much in Miami and I'm also gonna use
this a ton and when we go to Europe this
summer this came in so a handy it's also
a very very cute backpack it looks
really cute with a lot of things last
but not these from a little Shoetique I
also got some white like to smack myself
in the face event these white sandals
these are also really really great in
Miami walking around a lot they were
very comfortable I did get them a little
dirty I should probably wipe them off I
also will definitely taking
on my Europe trip I also got a two piece
set from India ex oh I saw this online
it was like I need that say really
pretty white two-piece dad was like the
pants and like a tube top with these
really really cute gold button details I
thought this would be really fun for
like a party a night out I was gonna
wear it's like a really nice dinner
everyone too recently and then I
realized the pants were a little bit too
long for me so I probably will have to
get them like tailored or like hemmed or
whatever the proper word is for that
because they are pretty long on me
either way I love this set definitely a
definitely a fun set just need to get it
like what does a word altered altered I
also got some stuff from princess Polly
I haven't loving their stuff lately I
did get this really cool olive green tie
top I'm loving the whole tie top trend
right now and this one has like the
short cup sleeves I love the color this
would be really fun with like a pretty
bra let in the summertime I also got a
another tie top with really pretty like
orange and blue I love this a little bit
longer sleeves with a longer tie in the
front really cute maybe some white
shorts or some white pants I also got
this simple like brown and white romper
now this is not my favorite thing in the
entire world but I do like it a lot it's
got a little cute pockets and it's
really simple which it was a little bit
more form-fitting and maybe had like
adjustable straps it is queue it's just
off not like my favorite thing in the
whole world I also got this really
really fun like fake crystal crop top
looks like something amber stole could
totally make by the way it's like a cool
little crisp fake crystal Briella and
it's like made out of like the stuff
that she buys all the time for her DIYs
like it's like real like gym type things
I don't know like it's metal dizzy cool
this top I've ever seen I feel like it
would be really really fun to wear I
really want to wear it since I've got a
really cute blouse right here is this
really simple something to just throw on
I really love the colors I love like the
muted neutrals I love the fit of it it's
very very nice very comfy very soft
they're cute I also got another two
piece sets I'm got a lot of sets this
time it's orange and white stripes
really really fun it's got shorts and
then like a tie a little tube top I
think this will be so much fun in the
summer maybe you want to go on my trip
I'll bring this as well I think it's
really fun
I love the colors I'm really into orange
and a yellow orange and yellow are like
my favorite colors right now now about a
few things in store at PacSun I got this
little tank top right here just orange
at yellow and white again I said orange
and yellow or colors I really like it's
just something simple to throw on and I
also got this yellow little like ruched
crop top right here it's over the
shoulder it's yellow with really pretty
like white flowers I am loving this
style of top and I also has the same top
but also in red this one has little
white diamonds all over like a little
diamond shape and last from PacSun I
just got a cute little off the shoulder
a simple baby blue top got two things
from Abercrombie I'm not gonna lie I
don't love a shopping at Abercrombie
probably because all the mean kids in
high school always wore out for crumby
and we're always mean because I didn't
wear out for crumby okay
but they have really good denim and
everyone always tells me if I'm looking
for good jeans or shorts to try them out
but I'm pretty sure doesn't the company
has like really bad like aren't they
like not nice people I could be wrong
but I feel like I remember people saying
they're like that a nice company so
maybe this would be like my wanting only
time shopping let me know in the
comments are they a good company should
I not be shopping there I want to know
the truth that's okay but I did buy two
things there because I was in a little
bit of a rush before we were left on our
trip because I had no shorts yet so I
did get this pair of denim shorts for
Abercrombie they are really really cute
nice and um nice little like destroyed
denim shorts they fit really really
nicely it's kind of hard for me to find
shorts that fit nicely because a lot of
you might not realize but I am kind of
pear-shaped where that means I have
pretty small on top but I have a little
bit of a bigger bottom now it's not that
much bigger but it is a little bigger I
do have like some hips and since I've
definitely I'll have like a thigh gap or
anything if you think I do it's probably
cause how I'm standing in photos not in
real life
so I have to get shorts that like are
tighter if they had a waist and a little
bigger in the hip area and these
actually fit really really well on I do
have to squeeze them up a little bit but
they do fit and I did really like that
the same thing for this denim skirt I
got really really simple really cute but
it's tighter here at the waist yeah and
look a little bigger around the hip area
so that it does
fit me nicely I don't feel like I'm
about to rip it but as your favorite
place to shop at or where should I do my
next haul for my next video should I do
like a testing hall for a certain store
is there a store that you want to see if
their stuff is good don't forget to
enter the urban the cake giveaway all
the details will be linked down below I
love you guys very very very much and I
will see you all next time make sure
