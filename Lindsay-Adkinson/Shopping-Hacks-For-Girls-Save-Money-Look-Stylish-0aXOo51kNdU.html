welcome if you're new today's video is
how to shop cheap and still look
fabulous embalm and stylish and whatever
you want to look good girl I'm going to
cheap bitch and it is okay if you are
chief if you are broke if you are stingy
cuz I am all of those and still want to
look fabulous because we deserve this
okay we deserve it it's okay sometimes
you wanna spend more money on Chipotle
than you do on your clothes but you
still want to look like a million bucks
you know that's possible totally
possible I'm going to share with you my
tips to how I get as close to as
possible to as stylish as I want to be
and also I promise you I have a shirt on
I'm wearing a body food but my hair like
covers all of it and also I have to keep
my hair over like my nips because we
don't see them because I don't have a
bra on TMI totally fine just so you know
I'm gonna shirt how are you sure okay so
on to the tip number one are your basic
Sandra neutrals now that is the base of
every outfit so look for your plain
stuff the basic stuff first off it's
usually cheaper you can find basic
anything skirts pants tank tops shirts
at any store forever 21 they're like
three to five dollars for all of your
basics and that is where any output is
going to start because you can layer
them you can accessorize them you can
dress them up you can make them fit for
any style basics are where is that girl
so start with your basic shoes can make
or break your outfit they can change
your outfit completely you can take a
basic neutral outfit and make it preppy
girly dressed up casual however you want
depending on the streams you can take
the same pants the same thing top and
all some high heels and wear it to a
look a cocktail hour thing you can take
those same pants and shirt out on some
business shoes moving out on some tennis
shoes it will change your outfit so make
sure you have good shoes for any type of
occasion you can still find really good
shoes for a good price as well Lola
Shoetique has like $30.00 older shoes
are about 30 bucks and they are insanely
good quality most of my shoes come from
Lola Shoetique and they're like really
good price
and are also bomb number for our
accessories now accessories are my
favorite part of an outfit and I'm not
just
about necklaces I'm talking about
necklaces I'm talking about brains I'm
talking about bracelets I'm talking
about birthdays I'm talking about
backpacks
I'm talking about sunglasses and talking
about bells if you have all of that on
top to a basic outfit it is going to
look bomb accessories are the easiest
way to dress up any outfit for any
occasion accessories do not have to be
expensive definitely make sure to stack
up stock up on your accessories and you
see something cute for a good price even
if you don't know what you're going to
wear it when to buy it and figure it out
later the accessories are what makes
your outfit you another thing is
layering your office jacket cardigan
scarves all the layers things are
basically accessorizing your all that
but there are accessories layers can
also really change an outfit so make
sure to have tons of things you can
layer on top of things
it really helps add up your outfit
whenever I see something growing like a
tank top in a cardigan and some cool
necklaces I'm like oh my gosh our outfit
so cute that I realized oh wait I could
totally do that at home
number five is adding some texture
texture looks expensive whether it is
denim whether it's late it could be
satin and it could be silk texture does
look a lot more expensive so I need a
piece like that especially when you're
going to can i tout or somewhere more
fancy can really glam up an outfit next
to it are dropshipping I'm not going to
a dropship I'm telling you to look for
places that do drop ship drop shipping
is basically where stores that you
probably shop at online usually get
their clothes from somewhere else and
don't make them I'm not going to say
specific stores but there are tons of
stores if you buy then you'll buy from
their store they'll get the clothes
you'll notice that the brand or the
label it's completely different than the
store you to shop from try searching
that label and see if they sell their
clothes online too I've had this happen
many times and usually it's a place
where they buy their clothes you can
also buy them from for like half the
price of what you spend on the original
store the next one is check cheap stores
thrift stores are my life I love for
stores Goodwill's and cities are so nice
this time of like Plato's closets or
like rag aroma all those different
places where people donate their clothes
people get rid of some good stuff and
obviously vintage is also really cool so
you find something that you think may be
a little torn up but you can kind of DIY
it and make it really cool then do it I
love direct stores I love cheap stores
because they you can always find good
stuff
you just got yet be willing to look for
it
another campus when you're shopping at
cheap source such as forever21 look at
the mannequins look at the displays look
at the stuff closer to the front so
typically the best stuff is going to be
at the front of the store at the
mannequins or the front of every section
I know forever 21 has like six different
sections for different types of styles
look at the front of all those sections
look at the displays look at the things
that catch your eye because shopping at
forever 21 is like a day trip to Ikea so
instead of swinging your whole day there
I would look for the things that really
stand out or they put out on its light
cuz those are usually going to be their
best items now this one is my a big tip
it may sound like a common in like
obvious that I don't know people think
about this I like to shop at the sale
racks and expensive stores but stay away
from the sales racks at cheap stores so
what everything is and if I'm going to
Urban Outfitters packs on Topshop I know
shop there unless I'm shopping is a sale
rack let me just be honest
Urban Outfitters has the best sale racks
because they go through their stuff
pretty quickly and most the time I will
see something at Urban Outfitters and I
will want it so guys this happens all
the time so many things I have in marine
Outfitters I will see it when it's so
bad it will be too expensive so I will
apply it I'll go back two weeks later it
will be on a sale rack for at least half
the price check the sale arrives that
expensive stores but I would avoid sale
rack sure places like forever 21 and H&amp;amp;M
because typically the sale racks the
forever 21 the stuff is all torn up it's
way too like torn apart way too messy
so if forever 21 is already cheap enough
I would avoid avoid the sale racks there
but stick to the found racks inexpensive
stores
another thing is checking out warehouse
sales and newsletter sales
sign up for newsletters for your
favorite stores because honestly I know
stuff is giving out your email but I get
so many emails for great sales that I
would have known out know about before I
signed up for zoo shoes
newsletters and then a few days ago with
an email they were having a warehouse
sale I went today that's what made me
think about this video idea I got 15
pairs of shoes all of their shoes were
on sale for about $5 I'm not kidding you
I spent like no money and I got 15 pairs
of shoes I got two pairs of sunglasses
for like four dollars so definitely sign
up for news
for your favorite source because often
they will have sales or have different
like discount codes sometimes loft
specials or warehouse sales if you live
in like a big city and you would have
known about it unless you sign up so
definitely look out for the big sales
cuz I usually don't go to my favorite
stores unless you're having a big sale
my cig escape is only splurge out of
things if you can wear it pretty often
so me up so many times I'll see
something I'm like oh my god I want it
and I will splurge on it and I will go
home later on and realize I splurged on
something that I can only use once or
twice so if your guys flirt on something
maybe splurge on a nice bag or a nice
jacket you can wear all the time versus
maybe not on one shirt that you can only
wear a few time so then you're going to
be like I wish I explored on something
else I can wear all the time like I
first I splurged on a nice purse because
I feel like it spruces up all my outfits
and makes them look a little bit nicer
when I'm wearing like a $10 outfit and
last but not least is confidence in
being yourself adding your own Flair
turnout that is going to make an outfit
so awesome so unique so you being
confident change all of it if you feel
good in your outfit you're going to look
good if you walk around to smile big
posture poses check out my video on how
to be a bad eye if you haven't seen that
big posture poses being nice to people
you're going to look incredible being
yourself drunken how do you want to
dress it going to make you so unique and
stand out and so awesome so definitely
be yourself be confident add your own
player and know that no matter how much
you spend on an outfit you can rock it
if you want to rock it so I love you
