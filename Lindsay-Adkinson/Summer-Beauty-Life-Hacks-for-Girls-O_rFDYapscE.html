I'm doing my summer beauty tips tricks
and hacks for you guys this is a club
with my friend Kendra from vlog with

beauty tips tricks and life hacks on her

obviously so make sure when you're done

awesome video she does a lot of like
natural organic type videos she does
pretty much everything you could want in
a lifestyle beauty Channel so you guys
might want to check out her channel and
subscribe to her while you are there and
without further ado let's get into my
video my first tip or life hack is to
get yourself some coconut oil now this
is one of my favorite things for beauty
stuff in general you can use coconut oil
for everything now I get really dry skin
in the summer so you can use coconut oil
as a most moisturizing or lotion my face
gets really dry so I'll use coconut oil
as a face mask my hair gets really dry
and it gets really frizzy from the
humidity you can use coconut oil as a
hair mask you can also apply a little
bit just a little bit to your fingers if
your hair gets kind of frizzy and you
can just use that like before you're
going out somewhere you can also apply
it to damp hair as a hair mask some
people also do oil pulling for whiter
teeth now I like to use the Radha
the Radha Beauty a fraction coconut oil
this is 100% pure coconut oil I like
this just because I know it's just the
brand that I've always used it's just
the one I typically grab for so I
definitely can recommend this brand the
rato Beauty coconut oil I literally use
this for everything throughout the
summer literally my hair my skin my
teeth everything there's so many
different things you can do if you'd
like for me to do some DIY videos like
beauty of DIY videos using coconut oil
they'll make sure you give this video a
thumbs up and I will do some of those as
well so it's summertime your hair
typically gets more staticky in the
summer at least mine does instead of
trying to figure out what on earth you
can do to get rid of it I always used to
freak out about that just grab a dryer
sheet like you use in your laundry and
raba your head with the dryer sheet and
your static will be completely gone now
summer time is the time to stay out late
and do a lot more things but you still
have to sometimes get up early for
things that you don't want to get up for
but I really like to use of my patch
ology
these are like eye gels basically when
you've stayed up way too late and you've
got dark circles or you've got like
lines on your bags and lines and your
eyes what you can do is you can take one
of these gel patches they are so gooey
they're kind of like fun to play with
you just apply it under your eye and
leave it on for five minutes take it off
rub in the excess gel and you're good to
go little leave my dark circles and the
darkness under my eyes is immediately
gone any bags or puffiness has
completely like
calmed down from my eyes I think the
pathology I gels are seriously Heaven
Sent
they're incredible and they're so fun to
play with and can you imagine in this
little bitty container there's like a
million in here like I always die when I
first bought mine I was afraid there's
only gonna be a few in here because of
the package size you open and there's
like a billion of them in this little
thing it contains a ton so I definitely
say think if you're someone who stays
out late or just someone who gets bags
or dark circles under your eyes
typically like most of us do I highly
recommend these hands down and I will
link this and everything it down below
now if your hair gets really dry in the
summertime if you're someone who likes
to be outside a lot and your hair gets
dry avocado is your best friend all you
have to do is mush up some avocado put
it in your hair leave it in for like 32
minutes to an hour your hair is gonna
feel 100% better and back to its normal
softness if you're someone who doesn't
want your hair to fade in the summer use
a vinegar just apply a little bit of
vinegar in your hair before you go
outside and your hair color is going to
have a lot less chance of it fading
that's a tip that I used to do when I
had really dark hair that I didn't want
to fade in the summer I decided a little
bit of vinegar and then my hair didn't
faint now if you're somebody who wants
to brighten up your hair just a little
bit in the summertime without having to
go to the salon you could take a little
bit of lemon juice now don't go crazy
maybe just spread some lemon juice in
your hair before you go outside and the
acidity in the lemon and the like the
heat from the Sun is going to cause your
hair to lighten just gently a little
subtly and it's really really nice gives
you some nice subtle highlights for the
summer time now my last tip is for you
self-tanning babies out there like
myself I am bad at self-tanning i soft
hand all the time I can't help it
I get pale easily so I like the soft
hands or not so pale um but if you're
like me and you get self-tanner all over
yourself I don't normally get it on my
palms on my all over my hands where it's
not supposed to be especially my
problems we don't know that
happens if you get self-tanner somewhere
that you don't want it to be baking soda
is key now a lot of people say that they
don't realize i self-tan because they
never see like self tanning hands baking
soda I just put a little bit of baking
soda on my hands wet it I scrub it a
little bit and then the self-tanner is
literally gone off my hands so you can
use baking soda for any of your
self-tanning mistakes now don't be
