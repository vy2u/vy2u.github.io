around 7:30 or 8:00 I know that's weird
but I just like starting my warm summer
days office orderly as possible I love
summer I start off by snuggling with my
dogs one of them was a little camera-shy
drinking a little bit of water to really
wake me up and then heading Oh checking
my phone first obviously and then
heading to my closet to get all of my
clothes ready since a day I like to get
my workout page ready the days and I'm
working out first thing in the morning
so I have no excuse but to go and get my
work out of the way and after I've
planned all of my clothes I go ahead and
have breakfast this morning I had a
pretty unhealthy breakfast
probably wasn't the smartest thing but
hey it was delicious we all need to have
we should all treat ourselves every now
and then right I mean come on and so
then after my breakfast I will do my
hair my makeup brush my teeth and then I
will head out the door but all of my
errands first thing in the morning we
just got our star bets um I got a sweet
tea lemonade what did you get all right
he's got a venti iced coffee I've
actually started getting up pretty early
lately like 7:30 because all the
neighbors say as they tend to go work
out early so we've kind of adapted to
that so guys we decided a vlog channel
like a month ago and whoever would like
one video but you should go subscribe to
her vlog channel because we're about to
start uploading a lot of stuff we
weren't we weren't as consistent

going on but now we're graduated we're
about to go to the beach good Chris

beach for a few weeks so we have a lot
of really fun applause we're actually
gonna do a lot of challenges and tags so

gymtyme actually weren't the bank so
Aaron time Benjamin Spock I run all
mayor's it is time to hit the gym for
about 45 minutes to an hour I typically
worked at about four days a week and
then after I feel like I've worked
myself as good as possible I am going to
rinse off and then head to the pool now
that it's warm enough I love to go into
the pool a little bit earlier in the day
before it's too crowded have a nice swim
