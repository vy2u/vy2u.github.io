I'm doing my summer night routine hope
you guys care about this because I mean
you might not I mean
routines don't really change and I just
did one like a few months ago like a few
weeks ago for a spring it's not even
really summer yet but I'm doing all my
videos early because I just couldn't
wait because I just love summer so much
there's so many summer videos I want to
do so I had to start early and before
you asked why I have a full face of
makeup on and my hair done for a night
routine at the end of my night that is
because that is because it's only four
o'clock in the afternoon so first on
this particular night I met my friend
Katie for coffee
she's also a youtuber if you didn't know
I will link her channel down below I
definitely recommend you checking out
her channel so we met for some iced
coffee some snacks or pastries and then
we also went ahead and saw movie while
we were there because the Regal Cinemas
is right across the street from the
coffee shop
so I went to a yoga class on my way home
which is why I am in workout clothes I
immediately locked my door when I come
in always safety first obviously guys
put up my sunglasses and my keys
take off my purse and I start my evening
at home once I'm inside the first thing
I typically do is hang out with my dogs
watch some TV guilty home get on my
computer check my emails my YouTube
comments all of that good stuff
basically anything just to de-stress and
relax
next I will go ahead and cook myself
some dinner this particular night I had
some sauteed zucchini I love a sauteed
any kind of vegetables and some pasta
with marinara sauce it was oh my gosh
delicious I'm hungry just thinking about
it
later on in the day it is time for some
pampered time I will typically do a
shower or a bath this particular night I
decide to have a lush bath mmm don't we
all just love pampering ourselves some
time and this is when I will take off on
my makeup brush my teeth all of that
good stuff
and then I will get ready for bed
and then afterwards I will put on some
comfy PJ's look how cute my sprinkle
donut top is and my fuzzy socks
I love these socks I really is pretty
much every day don't tell on me hey but
I wash them too and then I will just
play with my dogs a little bit longer
because I gotta get all their energy out
before we go to bed I will probably
watch a little bit more TV or get on my
computer I will also check my phone my
Instagram my Twitter if you weren't
following me yet why not I will link
that down below and then after I've done
all of that stuff I will finally lay
down and go to bed
I hope you guys enjoyed this video if

see if we get this video to 500 thumbs

any comments down below subscribe if you
