today's video is my night routine
typically I start out every night by
making myself some dinner or ordering
food either one I actually had a super
late lunch today and it was actually a
huge lunch so I was just doing a really
small light dinner tonight I decided to
make a salad and then it also had some
hummus and some crackers
and to be honest typically I will to see
at my couch or sometimes I'll just eat
in the kitchen like I did tonight I
decided I didn't feel like moving and
making an extra mess so I just ate at my
counter in the kitchen and as you can
see I did like some weird awkward
dancing I was laughing so hard when I
saw this back in my clips I don't know
what I thought I was doing but after
that it is time for me to do my nightly
chores tonight I'm just doing some
dishes I'm just cleaning up just a
little bit and once I'm done doing all
that it's time for me to take out my
dogs for their nightly walk when
typically walk about ten to fifteen
minutes just to get them a little bit of
exercise so they can start winding down
from
and then when I come back inside it's
time for me to sit down and watch some
TV and catch up on anything that I
missed usually I'll watch like something
on Hulu or Netflix just until I'm like
tired and ready to start getting ready
for bed now it's time for me to switch
into my PJs and then it's time for me to
go ahead and take off all my makeup and
wash my face and of course a brush my
teeth now when it comes to my skincare
I've been using exposed for a long time
you might remember them from my skincare
video I'm still using that I always
start off by washing my face with the
facial cleanser this is really great I
was really cleansing my skin and getting
off all of my makeup and then I go in
with you clearing tonic I just put this
on my hands and rub this all over my
skin this kindness honestly feels so
great and like really refreshing and
then last I go in with the clear pour
Syrah I put this on every night and it's
really really improved all my acne I
don't really have like any acne at all
anymore definitely a huge improvement
and then last but not least I go on with
my moisture complex so that my skin does
not get super dry like it does usually
and now it's time for me to get in bed I
always like take everything off my bed
and make it like super like neat beside
my bed so in the morning I can make it
pretty easily and once I get into my bed
I will typically sit on my phone like
always I'll be on Instagram sometimes on
snapchat I'll read my book all that kind
of stuff
also my Instagram and snapchat are down
below but now it's time for me to go
ahead and go to sleep I hope you guys
