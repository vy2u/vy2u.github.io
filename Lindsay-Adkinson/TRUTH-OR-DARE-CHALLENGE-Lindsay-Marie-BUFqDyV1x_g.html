ketchup mayo or mustard I almost want to
throw up just saying it fosters beside
me like now I didn't have a catch up I
don't have ketchup I wish I'd catch up
that'd be way easier and I'm not doing

doing mustard it's so weird because i
have mayo all the time i'm gonna have
mustard oh my god i eat mustard all the
time I'm not done Klosters not gonna let
me take this easy now 1 2 3 number two
is to lick Foster's foot or his toe Oh
keep your feet still I'm gonna lift the
little toe that was actually better than
the mess it up that's gross by the next
one is a truth and that is what is your
worst nightmare the worst nightmare
you've ever had funny story a few nights
ago actually been told foster I woke up
on I had a dream that I murdered someone
in my room like it was like it was so

other cheek oh all right so they let on
and off I now have like no makeup on but
I did it I'm so the next one is the
truth and that is how long have you gone
without showering now let me just be
honest with you there have been times
when I have gone too long I would say my
funniest longest time I think is when I
had LASIK so I don't know why but I was
terrified to have water touch my eye
after I had LASIK and lasik by the way
is like I surgery in case you didn't
know um but after I had my eye surgery I
didn't take a shower for like a full
five days that's a stuffy I'll find grow
