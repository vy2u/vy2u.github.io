or welcome if you're our newest today's
video is a back-to-school clothing haul
now this actually has tons of
back-to-school stuff but also has a few
things that are not back to school just
because when I was shopping there were
other cute things like that so be cute
all the weekends that's still cute for
when you're not in school so there are
some things that are not back to school
but I figured you guys would still want
to see them right hopefully some of you
guys enjoyed us although I am totally
like overdone today I have a photo shoot
a little bit and I was just like trying
to go marryin like a little whoo yeah
now face video does have a quick sponsor
from pinch pages act a way to save money
when you are shopping to get cash back
on things that you are already going to
buy they have over 1,000 sites that you
can shop from like Target Sephora
Nordstrom forever 21 so please is most
likely you are already going to shop
from so basically you can go onto page
they have a website and they have an app
I have my own like pinch website that I
will link basically go on to their site
or their app and you click through on a
product that you want it is going to
take you through the pinch portal to the
website that you want to shop from and
every time you add things to your car
and buy things you will get money back
and it's awesome because once you get
like cash back you can redeem it through
PayPal but you can also get a gift cards
like things like Sephora and Best Buy
and Amazon and stuff like that it is
like like saving money especially when
you're saving money on things you are
already planning to buy it's just like a
win-win situation so if you guys would
like to a check out pinch and save money
next time you plan on shopping anyways
that I will link there's their site and
all the information down below so in
first place that I got some clothes from
is Toby or shop Toby calm I love their
stuff I love their stuff now the first
thing I got all on my lap so it's like
trying to fall over on me the first
thing I got are these navy pleated pants
these are very like business cash I
think these are really cute really
perfect for dating or giving like a
presentation but I just like rating
these all the time I love the little
zipper down these are so cute the very
comfy as well I always worry when I get
like you know with work tight pants it
won't be comfortable these are so comfy
next is this grey a button-up
long-sleeve shirt I really love this and
add bell sleeves I love everything's
like slowly bell sleeves right now this
is really key
like a lot of chokers or black jewelry
silver jewelry anything like that I
really love that it's very soft it's
still really lightweight you can still
kind of wear it even though it's wore RL
which is nice
next I got this dress now this is
extremely low-cut so you will definitely
have to wear like a bra let with it or
some kind of tank top but I do love this
simple it's almost a greenish gray color
a very muted color which I really like
the color for this I love all the
cutouts and the details it is very
slowly this is actually pretty dress put
appropriate I would say as it's patent
way past your fingertips that goes down
to about your knees so it's all should
work it ain't taupe you should be fine
and look next time I know by itself
definitely is not okay for school but I
will try to think of how it would pair
then I was thinking over like a black
t-shirt or black tank top what do you
guys think how would you pair it this
little black tank top I think it's
really cute it's very pretty like gold
silky type shirt that ties in up front
so obviously there's a lot of showing
when you're wearing this but I do think
obviously pairs with something else it
could be very very cute you can either
like tie in the front or just leave it
untied if you have like a cute shirt
underneath and a lot Hollies from shops
Toby I got this beautiful white shirt I
love this blouse or is very friendly and
slow at the bottom it's got tons of like
lace-up details in the back it's
actually the lace is coming out I gotta
like tighten it back up because I just
took it off from trying it on for the
video it's also got really pretty bell
sleeves now obviously I know this is
very low-cut so you cannot wear
something that low-cut for school but
I'll be pleased you could pair it with a
cute tank top I have a really pretty
like mauve pink tank top but I think I'd
probably wear underneath it so next I
got a few things from fashion oh but you
guys know I love me some fashion over so
if I would show you what I got
first I got this cross like both of the
sweater material t-shirt
it says Friday on it I think this is
really cute um pretty simple but I just
really love this I love the bold green
next I got this body phones too but this
is actually an over-the-shoulder
bodysuit now again you probably gonna
wear this to school depending on your
dress code but I've been wearing this
all the time this is such a perfect
shirt for almost every kind of pants I
have so many pants like I call so many
pairs of pants I never knew like what
shirt swear that I needed like just a
plain tuft in white shirt fourth and
this has been doing
for that then I got this super for
against cute like Jersey t-shirt dress I
think it's not much ever supposed to be
a t-shirt or a dress but obviously too
short on me for a dress so I've been
wearing it as like it's like with
leggings super food for school to wear
this was like some leggings and like
some tennis shoes and like a casual day
I love it super edgy and fun
I love the bold zeros I love the black
and white I love the net at the top very
fun I love wearing this I was on my
Instagram and like it long with a bright
blue background everyone was asking me
where I got this so fashionable you guys
okay the next continuing on these are my
favorite things in the world look at
these cute mom shorts I got these from
national with like a mauve pink nude I
love these so comfortable definitely
dress code appropriate if you have like
the to your finger text dress codes and
these are perfect because these go like
a few inches past my fingertips these
are very comfy I've been wearing these
with that white body con suit the next
pants I haven't worn yet because it's
been really hot here but these are some
army green pretty tall these drawers
Chartres army green joggers these are
literally adorable they also have like
the drawstring and the front I love that
I love the color of these I love the fit
of these I love the big pockets these
look very flattering on very cute for a
casual day with a cute like I don't know
tucked in t-shirt and some sneakers okay
next I got some things from the full and
girls I got some stuff to tell ya so
just get rid of if it's a sub I fess up
everywhere first I got these pants now
these are like perfect for school
because these o feel like the jump and
they all kind of look like pajama pants
but they're not pajama pants these are
real pants like when you're holding them
like this they still look like PJs I
will insert a photo of me wearing them
like with actual like other clothes on
and they're not very meant to be like
regular pants like I checked my boss in
like user apparent this is like a style
now you know like a style everyone's
wearing them and I'm like these are so
cute they're so comfy I feel like I'm in
PJ's and that's all that matters
next we have this little romper here
this definitely is probably not school
appropriate because it is over the
shoulder it is like a strapless these
liked ice please but I got this because
I thought it was really cute and no and
actually no and I are taking like a mini
like one day vacation to this really
cute like sunflower field this week
I thought it might be cute for some
photos but this pretty cute and comfy so
material a little weird it feels a
little rough next we have this two piece
set which looks really cute on I will
say it looked really cute on but the
material is so weird before I put it on
I'm not gonna lie when I first got this
I'm you know we're like is this made out
of a shower curtain like I'm not I'm
honestly not sure if you could feel this
you'd be like that might be made out of
a shower curtain I don't know what it's
made out of but but but but it does look
really cute on again this is something
you cannot wear to school I also got
this for that same like trip that we're
doing and it's like like an end of
summer outfit you know so I thought I
would just throw it in here don't be mad
because you still have weekends you know
if you're in school you still have
weekends
now there's a little jumpsuit you
probably saw on my Instagram
I got a million compliments about this
jumpsuit and I do like it
I do it'll be just gorgeous the material
the powder is gorgeous I've been seeing
this lemon pattern everywhere so I was
really excited for this and I still am I
saw it colors of it on my Instagram but
I'm going to tell you I don't know if I
can ever put it on ever again the reason
being is like the little loops made for
the buttons are so unlike for this one
they were sewn way too tight so to put
these buttons through those loops is
like literally like shaving skin off
your fingertips because is so hard to
put these buttons through these loops
you'd even say when I was trying on to
this video you can ask no I was getting
so frustrated because my fingers were
rubbed raw because it's a hardest thing
you like pull let me show you if I get
my caption these little blue okay and
see and they're so tiny you gotta like
push your thumb through it and like try
and put this button I'll see if I can
even show you now to try and put this
button through layer and it does not
normally go
it just doesn't they just made the loops
a little too small as what I'm trying to
say and another thing it towards the
bottom where your crotches they didn't
put a button there's no button from like
crotch area to like belly button area so
I kind of just when you're walking just
kind of opens and everyone can just see
you're on these so that's also like when
you're not in photos is
also kind of like a home as awkward next
I got two things from Nordstrom Rack
because I love Nordstrom right actually
the supply haha
everyone like Nordstrom Rack and I have
never really been there laughed and I
started going to a Nordstrom Nordstrom
Rack a few times but I'll be honest I
like pretty cheap even when things are
on sale I'm like huh I don't know
so have you freely gone super sale which
is why I was like ok cool let's do it
first thing off is really cute like with
this material called what is this cool I
don't know it just this polyester but
you don't talk about these like cute
little suede velvet velvet type shirts
not obviously you could not wear this
just as it is to school but I see
everyone is wearing these cute tank tops
on top of like white t-shirts kind of
like here with this white t-shirt but I
feel like I might pair it like this a
lot of people have been doing that I
think it's really cute so I think that's
how I will probably wear it next I got
this shirt it's inside out but you'll
see it when I show you it on um if I
just got this on the Juicy Couture
section at Nordstrom Rack and I was like
oh no how much is that gonna be but it's
on sale for like $14 I was like oh yeah
because I won't have like any nice
t-shirts I feel like this would go
really cute with those all green that's
like joggers I showed you things like
that I don't have any t-shirts that are
plain like this it just has one little
you know emblem on it which I thought
was cute I don't wanna show you this
really cute ring I got because it has a
really cool story I want to tell you
this is how the little guys film - that
Jay Baer is a local jewelry boutique or
store here now it's really cool because
they were having a market here like
downtown called like moonlight market
where people come out and sell their
stuff really cool I was walking through
and I saw this booth with really cute
jewelry but they had like a display of a
polaroid photos basically he printed out
all the photos that people took where
they tagged like his company in their
photos and my friend Amanda actually
wears their jewelry all the time and I
guess when I asked her to be my maid of
honor she was wearing her jewelry and
tagged in so he printed the picture and
put it on his display so I'm walking by
and I see this picture of a girl holding
a coffee cup that says maid of honor and
I'm in the back like oh so it was a
picture of me and my best friend's like
wait that's mean
Polaroid how cool is that I think I was
like oh really okay yeah that's my best
friend she's wearing y-your rings I
guess like that's when I asked her to be
my maid of honor she must have time to
you guys like oh yeah we posted it we
love that picture and he goes wait are
you Lindsay Murray yes oh we love your
stuff and I'm like oh that's so cool and
they were so nice and he was like we'd
love to give you a ring if you like to
work with us and I'm like that's so cool
so I want to shop him out real quick
because their jewelry was really cute I
was like idolizing it on the table
Sonia's like would you like one I was
like facial work are you sure but anyway
so again this is a little sky stone I
will make their jewelry down below they
have some really cute stuff really nice
like dainty jewelry and like really
high-quality jewelry which is great so
