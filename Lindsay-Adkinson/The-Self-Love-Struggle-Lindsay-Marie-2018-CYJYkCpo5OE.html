with your new first off before we get
started I would love it if you are new
if you would like to subscribe to do
that down below you can also press that
Bell button which is how you turn on my
notifications and that's like the only
way you won't miss my uploads though I
wanted to start a series on my channel
where I wake up in the morning I set up
the camera and I talk to you about
something we can pick up pick out the
topics together sometimes I'll pick them
sometimes you can send them in maybe I
don't do this
once every other week also I want to
call it something but I'm not sure what
maybe like messy mornings or morning
musings I don't know looking at
something with morning's maybe or
something with messiness because I'm
gonna wake up with bedhead I'm not gonna
get ready I just like what I was it get
up and like brush my hair and put some
dry shampoo in and put on a makeup and
like get ready and straight my hair
something like that like by the end I
would feel like camera-ready and there's
a there's no such thing as camera-ready
after you get all ready you go from like
hey guys hey guys you know that's um not
always me cuz I really don't get ready
that often this is me most days so I
just feel like this is how I'm gonna be
my most me self and I won't really want
to just sit down and talk to you guys
about these things I've got a whole list
of things I want to talk about from
alcoholism to a dysfunctional families
to abuse some serious topics I'm also
some light-hearted topics you guys have
you know in the comments anything you
want me to talk about what yeah today I
wanted to talk about self-love and the
struggle of self-love because I really
struggled with self-love for a long time
I would read these books and think okay
they say do this this and this
okay I'm gonna finish the book alright I
read the book okay now I love myself
right yeah yeah and I would think okay
I'm great I love myself move on instant
a week later or two weeks later or a
month later but okay I'm depressed again
and I don't really think I love myself
that much so I read another book and
then I think okay she said to do this
and then you were great so I did that
and then I feel great and then it was
later okay I don't feel so great again
and I just think I always wonder like is
there something wrong with me like am I
not reading the book enough I need to
read more self-help books like I used I
would read like one a week I would just
keep reading them I know a lot of people
do that and I would realize that I
wasn't really taking in the information
I was reading one book going to the next
book reading one going to the next and I
wasn't really stopping and learning what
it was saying to do I was just kind of
using it as a crutch almost like okay
this girl says she loves herself makes
you feel bad acts it makes her feel like
she it makes her successful sure she
loves herself and I was like okay I love
myself because I want to be successful
and it's like that wasn't right that
wasn't right because after all whenever
I would get forget about the last book
I'd go through these little phases where
I was very depressed I have lots of
breakdowns I would cry you know I get
down on myself I'm so mean to myself I'm
hard on myself and I would just read
these books thinking like okay these
people like how do they not go through
that they must be perfect they must
never do this stuff they must you know
they must have it right I must not have
it down yet until I realized one day I
never can I never really convey on my
channel either it did I go through stuff
like that and I think that's part of the
problem it's so many people want to
preach those things without preaching
the fact that they're still going to be
bad days and I think that's needed
because I think that that messed me up
for a long time I used to think like I
couldn't love myself if I got depressed
I couldn't open myself if I crying I
couldn't love myself if I messed up and
told myself I was ugly one morning you
know and obviously that is a problem
like you shouldn't say those things
yourself but I realized I had to stop
reading the books and thinking that was
my answer
and really just asked myself what is
self-love and how do I know if I love
myself so it's not like okay I love
myself because I'm saying I want to be
successful that's not so Club you want
to ask yourself first why do I want to
love myself and why do I love myself
what do I love about myself and then you
think people love self love is because
you want to feel worthy valuable so you
have to ask why are you valuable to
yourself why are you worthy and those
are gonna bring out big answers and when
you start fighting the good answers that
is where your love comes from for
yourself when you realize I love myself
because I went through some rough stuff
and I'm still here
I'm making these videos and I'm not
afraid to do it you know I love myself
because I'm valuable to me I'm valuable
to people around me and you have to know
that I used to think like I preach
self-love but then I was so afraid to to
be myself around people I was so afraid
to even let myself shine because I
didn't want to seem smart or
knowledgeable and that's so weird I
didn't want to shine in front of people
I wanted them to help me I wanted to
make myself feel small so they can feel
big and that's not self-love you know
self love is letting yourself shine and
be bright while also letting others
shine too but I knew like the people
that write those books there is no way
they don't have bad days you know they
may not write about them in the book
they may write about their bad days
before they found self-love but they
they have bad days too and if they say
they don't well I need to see her to
that because I don't know about that um
because life is tough you know you're
gonna have bad days you're gonna have
good days but if you really want
self-love it's not just reading those
books and think okay you gotta meditate
okay you got a fishline okay I made a
vision board alright I'm good
no it's digging deep and finding out why
you want to love yourself you've got to
love the inside about you kind of love
the bad about you thoughts are just
thoughts
okay you have to separate yourself from
your bad thoughts I started realizing
okay those bad thoughts are not me
that's my fear that's my fear of not
being good enough it's my fear of not
you know getting what I want and you
just have to tell your fear hey listen I
appreciate you being afraid it's okay I
understand but I got this no need for it
so the point of this video is I just
want people to realize that struggling
within self love is very normal in my
opinion now I don't think I should
struggle the way I used to struggle I
used to struggle so frequently and that
was a bit unhealthy but I've gotten to a
place where yes I have bad days yes I've
got a especially close to that time of
the month I usually have one big cry
where I let everything out and I say all
these things and usually the next
morning I don't really
didn't mean half of them Excel fluff is
a struggle it's not just a one-day thing
it's not like you just find it and it
goes away look you have to practice it
every day i do like i thought i was
wrong because i would have moments of
weakness but no it's not it's not wrong
it's it's normal like I would feel like
oh my god I don't love myself today and
then I would be mad and it would get
worse and I tumble into anxiety and
stress and then before you know I'd be
so mean to myself where you know I'd be
super depressed and instead I need to do
is know like know that self love
self-worth self value all of those
things are a daily practice every day I
have to get up and when I look in the
mirror I have to work on looking at
myself and not saying oh I look so bad
without makeup I've got to work on
looking myself in that oh this is your
face I love that face that face is
beautiful you know that face is worthy
you gonna do it too you know I've got to
make sure I work on that I've got to
work on it every day I've got to get up
and I know that I haven't worked better
and do better if I get in the morning
get up in the morning so I've got to
know like okay gotta set my line I'm
gonna get up why because I'm I value
that morning time and it's it's good
that I value that you know so I'm
letting myself live with my values I'm
letting myself talk about what I'm
passionate about he's got a really work
on listening to a the way you talk to
yourself and asking yourself why am I
saying that is because I'm scared
probably is it because someone else made
me feel not good about myself possibly
and that's a big thing you can't listen
to other people say because there's
usually when someone is mean to you or
someone doesn't like you it's always
about them it's almost never about you
like I have people even now that don't
like me and their reasoning is saying
like I'm too nice and to me I've always
thought that was I even said that before
I was like it's a weirdest thing to say
someone it's like like they're so nice
and it's fake like that's what that's
that's on them not on me because I'm not
think anyone who knows me in real life
all of my people people that know me in
real life I can say proudly talk about
how I had such a motivation to them and
an inspiration I'm always so kind
because I am really
person so when people say those things I
don't I used to I used to get so upset
used to get so upset like all I don't
believe in me and do I message them and
tell them I'm really nice think what if
I got comments or do I call them no you
know what I do I say okay they've got
something to work on let them work on it
they'll figure it out in time I just got
to keep being me let my light shine work
on loving myself love myself and keep
working keep striving for better keep
working harder you know and that is
self-love it is a struggle it is a
day-to-day hard working there's a fly
hard working thing you got to keep
working at it's not just like it just
happens overnight and you're good so if
you feel like you're struggling right
now you feel like you don't love
yourself well you got to get started you
got to start working at starting today
and know that it's okay to struggle it's
okay for it to be something that takes
time it's okay to get there and then
have days where you're not there you
just have to know that you are worthy
and you are beautiful and you are so
sexy and you're so funny and kind and
personable and you're passionate and
you're valued and you are worthy and
