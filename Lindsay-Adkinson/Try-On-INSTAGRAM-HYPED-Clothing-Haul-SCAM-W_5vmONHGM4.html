or welcome if you are new today's video
is a huge just try on haul everything
from like clothes from like new online
websites I found to some really
affordable stuff like a really
affordable and also shoes and some
accessories now you guys have seemed to
really been liking my whole differently
so I was like why would I complain both
that gives me more reason to shop and I
also cleaned out my closet recently
which gave me even more reason to show
off those books all right let's do this
okay so the first place I got some stuff
from is shop ooh la la
now this is a new online fashion
boutique and they actually reached out
to me it was like hey we like your haul
videos you'd like to send you some stuff
and see what you think and I was like I
couldn't turn down for you oh so feel
free to I said I would show you guys
what I picked out and what I thought
about everything that I got the first
thing they picked out from shopping Lala
it's really pretty oversized jack it's a
really really good quality super thick
denim so I can definitely wear this is
like a jacket in the fall or winter but
also I could just wear this to dress
something up or like make it more of a
statement piece for other office as well
I love it because it's got tons of rips
on it super fun I love this vinum jacket
I've actually been pairing this with
like you know tight like little short
dresses right now where it was t-shirt
dresses it's really cozy as well so I
love that so just this this dress a gray
t-shirt I see a lot of people wearing
Navy that was really fun casual shirts I
like too distressed parkas I can wear
like a fun colored tank top underneath
or like a bralette and you can just kind
of see it peeking through just a little
bit but almost look cute pretty casual
but something I could easily wear just
whatever and my favorite thing about
this shop cool all off site is
everything on their site was so
affordable like I'm talking so
affordable the next thing is the last
actual clothing item I got from their
site is just really pretty lace detailed
dress and if you look at the up-close
details that I'll put on the screen it's
super good quality like the lace looks
super high-end looks very free people a
people Lee I feel like I said is
something you could find it free people
I feel like I could really dress this up
with some fun jewelry wear this like a
fun night out I really like it I think
it's really pretty
I love the Chilkoot acts as well it
makes it really even prettier has like
you know a little necklace attached it
almost looks like makes it even girlier
and even dressier so
definitely I love this dress last but
not least from sha la la I've got this
headband right here is just a bandana
headband just because I've never had one
I saw them on their site and I was like
you know why not I haven't really worn
this yet but I feel like I'll probably
wear this maybe even with that denim
jacket this would be really cool
now Jacques ooh-la-la was also nice
enough to give me a 40 percent off
discount code I will put that into the
scripture box if you want to shop at
their website down below the next thing
is I got was from a site called where
all if you've seen these these these
people you've got a few seasons there
stuff on the instagrams that's because
I've been wearing them for a while and
the first thing I actually got from
where all is the shorts I am wearing now
so they're really cute fun white tank
top that says reckless that has a really
cool strip where this go out these are
called with these little strips down the
middle you didn't either way I love this
I think it looks really cute right now
next is this really really cute I love
it's not acute it's like edgy and
awesome this crosses sweater crop
sweatshirt or cropped hoodie away at
mcdonaldís the switcher these are my
cents troublesome 20xx on the front I
love this it also has netted material on
the bottom of the shirt and twice on the
sleeves I love the necks on this I love
how its crops like this is so edgy and
fun I also picked out these white pants
I love them because they have the laces
up side I love this lace up detail goes
all the way down it's also like a little
bit see-through where the laces are
that's on your legs it shows a little
bit of skin but I like it I think it's
really cool I love these pants super
good material really good quality and
they're actually really stretchy so
they're not like itchy or uncomfortable
and next you might have seen this skirt
on my Instagram is this denim skirt now
this is crazy because I never wear
skirts like that it's very hard for me
to find a skirt that I find flattering
on me this video skirt is everything is
so cute I love it very nice and
form-fitting very good material out of
it
now this next item is a little sad for
me these are these boyfriend jeans I
picked from where all these got tons of
rips all over them however they don't
really fit me I don't know i'ma show
using a try on it what they look like on
and you let me know I feel like maybe I
just got too big of a size not going to
seem to be like one size smaller and
then they'll fit me but either way they
are so so freakin cute I was so
they didn't really fit me all the way
okay nice I got some a really cute stuff
from this website called agachi
I hope I'm saying that right either way
they have some cute oh my gosh it was so
hard picking things out and not spending
too much there so first I got this
robber right here is black with some
really pretty red and like lights lights
Coralie details that has tons of Kyle's
all over its got some frills at the
bottom tons of details tons of cute Pat
the pattern is so cute definite
something you can wear like in the
summertime when you're like hanging out
and going to a festival or something
and I got this all black lace duster is
very few I love this probable Paris like
you know anything I love kimonos and
dusters right now and get so easy like a
kind of silo band outfit with kimonos
investors this one is really pretty
really good material really good quality
I like this one a lot and I have this
really pretty blue body too I love this
I love the colors it's got a really nice
neutral toned floral patterns really
slinky like all of you it makes you look
really good love it then I got this
really really pretty this is called like
a romper probably still it's basically a
romper and it is a short but then also
has like kind of like a longer piece in
the back so that your life still peak
out you'll see when I try it on
obviously so whore just love the floral
love this material oh this is like then
we might go to summer dress you can go
sign a dress like a robber but just
great
then these jeans we're doing it so well
for me so then my other games didn't
work out was so excited because these
jeans that did work out these are also
boyfriend style jeans they've got really
big cutouts on the knees
they are cuffed at the bottom light wash
super well fit really nice material feel
really good on really cozy they
stretched a little bit so they don't
like they're not uncomfortable
love these jeans I also got two belts
for them because we had a really
affordable belt it was six dollars for
two belts so I got a plane but left
alone because they always need a plane
back black belt I only have like one
belt really and I also got this a
cream-colored one that will just kind of
go with any of like my brown clothes or
anything like that so yeah now the next
place I went that flows from is also
accompanied the contacted me the
just asked me if I would look at
something close as well now this is a
really interesting site this is faction
five nine nine now facto five nine nine
basically the place that you shop if you
really want some super affordable stuff
everything everything on their site is
like they also have a store and like Los
Angeles but they also have an online
store and like everything on their site
is like less than ten dollars now I was
like okay that's interesting let's see
what they have so the first thing that I
got from them is just the height and
body count of black skirt really nice
for like going out I can just wear this
with any kind of crop top it is very
good material very good quality very
form-fitting I think this is just a very
nice staple skirt and then the next
thing I got from fashion at 599 is this
pink out but it feels like more workout
pink out which is why I grabbed this
she's a simple gray tank with a cool
little design on this you've probably
seen something like this before
also very good material so here's the
thing I notice what their website I
would say they have like super trendy
clothes just to be honest they don't
have like super trendy new stuff but
they do have like tons of basics so if
you would what basics are what you need
for if you're wanting to shop and you
don't have a lot of clothes or you want
to like have a cool wardrobe
I think basics are important and
considering all their basics are good
quality and under $10 I think it's a
really good idea to shop there so like I
said they don't have like super trendy
stuff it's just the basics and I also
got this black tank top right here it's
got a really pretty like lace to like
lace detailing all around it it's also
fully lace in the back this would be
really cute like under kimono with some
cute jeans and lots of necklaces I
definitely see myself wearing this one
probably the most out of the items that
I got that's out these are something
that I'm not 100% sure if I'll wear it's
actually 8 which is a white t-shirt like
this it's got some lace detailing in the
front and lace detailing on the side it
is good quality if you are looking for
some cheap online clothes not definite
not a bad idea so fashion 599 is where I
got those from so nice and I got two
pairs of shoes a promo Cupid you've
probably seen these like they sell Cuse
of brand shoes like almost every place
cuz you can buy shoes the first ones I
got are these slip on sandals I love
these I love the designs on them
actually the very first here slip-on so
these are great because they're so fine
I can flip them on like when I'm just
running out the door and I'm wearing
like a super
I feel like shorts and a tank top this
honestly makes my outfit look so much
cuter and they're so easy to put on
that's just like a plus I am going to
live in these shoes a summer I love them
so much I've actually worn them like
every single day since I've gotten them
and then I say I also got these oh my
god boom I love these these are barely
Western edgy style I love them I love
the color I don't know what would you
call this like what is this a pewter
definite color I hate that word I think
that's what it's called it's kind of
like a grayish purpley tone oh I love
them these are gorgeous I can wear this
with anything I'm gonna wear these all
the time these are such going to be
staple of stand out shoes they're going
to make my outfit they will make my day
at the same time now next I got two more
pairs of shoes from his website for a
company called grapes now oh my gosh
these I finally have I didn't have any
tennis shoes I didn't have any slip-on
casual shoes all I have like sandals and
boots because that's what I usually wear
but there are days when I wear outfits
like this with those shoes don't really
mask so the first thing is I got from
grace are these white lace up shoes
these are something so to be honest I'm
actually not a fan of the Adidas shoes
everyone wears I like them everyone else
because if they like them but I feel
like ideas are a little too thick out of
that make sense if they make me feel a
little big so these are not super thick
they just look at my feet look normal
size these are going to feel great
really those boyfriend jeans I just
showed so many casual outfits I can wear
this with I can enjoy this one with any
edgy outfit those white jeans I got
these they're super comfy they look so
fab I'd have to keep these white though
because they are not getting dirty I
love them too much and an extra garvey's
these are called the Worcester I believe
and they're black slip lines
I love these like they remind you like
too high a higher-end brand version of
the old slip-on bands I used to wear but
these are clearly not bands obviously
these are like I'm stepping up in the
world I still have my van so I'm not
fond of a and don't think that LM
because these are really nice they're
very nice material they feel so well
these are such good quality which you
could feel them I love the white soles
the bottom they're so thick which makes
it really stand out I love the black is
very shiny
the inside these are so great because
they literally take half a second to put
on and out the door but these don't look
like super like casual throw on shoes
they look like really nice shoes but
they took like no time to put on and I'm
so lazy so like that's the perfect next
I got three things from wrong way and I
got to be honest guys I've put it over
that site I felt a little bad saying now
but like everyone tells me like I mean I
was just trying to try try them out one
last time because sometimes I get good
thing sometimes I get bad things and I'm
like over it this episode bad some stuff
is cute I just don't think I'm going to
shop there anymore just because like
this stuff is really hit or miss and
that drives me nuts
but this is a simple gray t-shirt said
you go Glen Coco from Mean Girls I've
wanted to share it for a while from
there and I think good this is my last
time shopping there so I was like let's
go ahead and get it and I also got this
white button-up just because I always
say a1cs I never buy them so I finally
got one super kind of spin material
which is okay though opposed to wear
like a brawl at under it or like a kami
I love the big pockets I have and I just
feel like it's just an easy throw onto
like a nice dinner or something
the last hour you actually really like I
got from romwe really cool like paint
splatter looking shirt I have a khatai
at the bottom some of their Tim's are a
little like coming off of like take
those off but it is a nice it is nice
quality it feels a little little cheaper
but most of their stuff kind of dies
it's just a casual tank top but I just
like the pattern so I feel like I will
end up wearing this then I also got a
dress from Joe of brown and I'm not
going to lie I was a little just a
little slightly disappointed I love Joe
Brown stuff I always look at their
Instagram I only have one shirt from
them because the little pricey but I did
get this white flowy dress it's just not
as flattering on as I thought it would
be it's a little really slinky on the
model like it looks like it hugged a
little bit this is actually just super
big and oversized it does come one size
as well and the other thing is it's very
very see-through on the model it did not
look see-through at all it definitely
looks like just a political white dress
but it is so see-through to the fact
that you absolutely have to wear a tank
top a McCamey or something underneath it
or you can't wear it out which is fine
it's just like it didn't look like an
either one on the website so that was a
little sad but if you like it I think I
can pair this with some really cute
boots maybe my new boots actually
and like a hat or something I probably
still will wear this I think I just wish
it wasn't so see-through and it hugs me
just a little bit more and I also got
one shirt from Urban Outfitters there's
just this really simple black of the
shoulder top I've actually worn this a
few times a word in my testing it's a
great are testing one arm makeup video
really casual but really cute and I just
I really like it and it's really comfy
and really soft too and it was on sale
so that's really why I bought it and
another thing you guys have been asking
me about my tiger mist pre-order so when
I did my Tiger mist review or testing
this video a while back I told you that
I had one shirt that was on pre-order
and this is it was the shirt honestly
this is gorgeous
however this shirt is a freaking pain to
get on and off okay so this looks like
most body suits which are usually pretty
tight but usually tight body suits are
made out of like a stretchy material
because if it's going to be really tight
you still have to get it over your head
and over your shoulders this thing is
not stretchy it is literally like the
most like it's not going to move
material and I have to like put it over
my head and literally it feels like it's
going to rip or I'm going to bust out of
it as I'm putting it over my shoulders I
felt a little claustrophobic putting it
on I don't know how often I'll wear it
because of that honestly is freaking out
so badly asked Noah I was freaking out
but once it's on this shirt is literally
so gorgeous I put it on and I ended up
like liking it so much that I was too
afraid to take it off because I noticed
how hard it was to get on so I went
ahead and filmed two videos wearing it
you thought you might already seen them
I think they're both argue on my channel
it was my two reason Instagram videos
but yeah I do like the shirt it's just a
pain to get on so I'm gonna have to like
only wear this for like really special
occasion well next I got some swimsuits
from Cup sheet it's kind of like this is
a full website everyone is shopping
there right now they're really big on
Instagram I wanted to try them out so
the first one I got is just a
high-waisted stripe swimsuit and
honestly I'm not that impressed
I think the top looks really cute it's
nicely nice material it does feel like
good quality doesn't feel like it's
going to rip however it's supposed to be
high-waisted and as you see in the photo
over the sub Tryon part this is not stay
up it's like as soon as you put it up
over your bail
but like the elastic is isn't made well
enough they just falls right back down
so it looks more like a really baggy two
big free bottoms than high-waisted but
the top is really cute but I probably
will not wear this out to just to be
completely honest because it was just
too baggy and just didn't look like it
was supposed to look on next I know this
orange like tie-dye type material one I
saw this a lot on their Instagram so I
thought I would get it I do like this
one a lot more I like the color it's
really pretty orange pretty simple I
love the I really like the detail on the
side it's like a netted material but I
love it super cute did some fish really
well it's really good material yeah it's
pretty simple it's got a in a an
adjustable strap which you guys know I
need adjustments because I have weird
shoulders I feel like and nothing ever
fits me but yeah this one is good
quality and I do see myself wearing this
and then I also got this one piece you
actually might have actually seen this
one already onto my life is ava or a the
Gutowski she wore this on her Instagram
and like ties them and I was like okay
that is such a pretty Simpson I need it
and guys it's still just as gorgeous the
only thing is it's very loose on the
side so it's a one-piece but the size of
it it's so loose that like if you move
too much my nips are going to show so
you definitely have to make sure when
you wear this to be careful like you
don't want to be swimming laughs and
this one I don't think other than that I
do something to see myself wearing this
one just got to be careful I think I got
friend cup she is this other swimsuit
it's like a denim looking so I'm
supposed to look like it is denim I
think it has a good tie in the front
pretty cute I don't know if it's like my
favorite swimsuit I've ever had in my
life to be completely honest I tried
getting other swimsuits but everything I
tried getting they like would like send
me emails after I try and check out okay
sorry that's one suits out of order but
it wouldn't say it was out of order so I
have to pick other ones and I was like
so kind of going with this one it's not
like my favorite swimsuit on the planet
but if you like this one I will tell you
it is good material it is good quality
it's fine it's going to fit you fine
it's a really good price like I said it
just look like my favorite pattern in
the entire world but pretty good pretty
good quality for the price and next I
got to Colonials from forever 21 because
I love kimonos the first time I got is
this really pretty like light hand color
with tons of flowers all over I love
this very very pretty the greens and
reds
that's very long this one goes like all
the way down to the floor not like all
the way down but it's pretty long gossip
listener though so it looks very slowly
and like moves a lot when you're walking
in the wind it's just very like boho and
gorge and I got this black kimono this
one is actually shorter if it's more
like a normal jacket style but I love us
when I love like the standout bold
colors that are really bright yellow
bright reds and pinks it really makes
its tail is also some blue on there as
well it really stands out against the
black this is really nice to throw on
with a casual outfit I love this one
especially when it's like cooler at
night I've just been grabbing this
almost is it like like a lightweight
jacket ls have two accessories for you I
got a new bag recently this was from
Rebecca Minkoff so I did not get it like
from Rebecca Minkoff I got on Saks
office it's actually depending on when
you're watching this it's either just
been my birthday or will be my birthday
my birthday's on May 4th so just depends
on when I upload this but actually Saks
off this just sent me a birthday present
which I live was literally like what
like thank you they send me a gift card
and went pick out this purse I love this
one is really pretty like crossbodies
got really cute tassels as well I love
the zippers I love this bag I've
literally been carrying it every single
day and laughs at least is this hat I
got actually picked this up at Nordstrom
Rack just because hats they're cute and
I never wear them and I thought like it
was time to buy one I don't know if I'm
ever gonna wear this in my life to be
completely honest but I wanted it what
do you think should I wear this may go
