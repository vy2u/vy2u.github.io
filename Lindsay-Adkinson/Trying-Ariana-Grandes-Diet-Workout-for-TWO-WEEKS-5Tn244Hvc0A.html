where no such a okay hey guys and
welcome back or welcome if you are new
it looks like it might be super dark on
camera hopefully not Ohio is just back
and forth and today it has been so dark
outside and I was like if I don't go him
today the videos not going up because
it's supposed to go tomorrow so fingers
crossed it's not too dark today's video
is going to be testing or trying out
Ariana Grande's diet in workout routine
so ariana is completely vegan meaning
for two weeks I made sure to cut out all
dairy products all meat and if most of
you guys know already I already do cut
out most of I like I don't really
consume any dairy and I've cut out most
of meat so it was pronounced that part I
would say was pretty easy for me also
ariana is big on certain foods so for
breakfast every single day she tends to
do either oatmeal on a fruit or she does
a specific smoothie she has 3 different
different smoothies that she alternates
between and I won't put the exact like
recipes down below or links to them I
found them from her trainer saying that
there's 3 smoothies she'll alternate
between one is the red smoothie one's
called white smoothie and one is called
a green smoothie so I tend to do like
one smoothie one day alternate them I
also alternate between the oatmeal I
will say I hate oatmeal I hate the
texture of it so I tended to do more of
the smoothies and then the oatmeal but I
did make sure to do the oatmeal
sometimes just not too much so for the
lunch it tended to be a pretty large
lunch and everything I ate for the most
part for lunch was raw so for example I
would do a huge kale salad top it with
raw peppers cucumbers carrots any
veggies I could think of to like make it
different each day she would also do a
whole sweet potato or a whole potato
every day for like her carbs today I was
eating my last one I was like I don't
know if I can swallow this I love sweet
potatoes but have you want every single
day for two weeks you're like oh I hope
so she also for snacks eats a lot of
protein bars as well as blueberries
being her two favorite go-to snacks so I
did make sure to have tons of
blueberries on hand
tons of protein bars now for our dinners
it says her favorite go-to things to do
are typically just a stir-fry of some
sort which is basically just for her a
mix of a ton of different veggies which
is pretty much all I did for every
single dinner I just took a ton of
veggies and mixed them together and then
just through sometimes I threw a
seasoning on them sometimes I didn't I
was not able to do like any salt or like
- anything with too much salt I did this
week for the diet so I didn't do
anything that was like too flavorful but
for the most part it was doable now
things I had to cut out for my coffee
you guys know I am a big coffee drinker
I cannot do any like crazy creamers or
sweet creamers I have not gone to
Starbucks or anything like that all I
did for my coffee actually have one
right there it's just coffee with a
little bit of almond milk and that is it
I will say that I got a lot easier
throughout the two weeks a lot easier
than like the first day and also I cut
out also does I know you guys probably
know I love my soda but I kind of all
cope I also tried a ton of new foods
I've never tried before she tends to eat
a lot of daikon which is a root and it
actually tastes really really good I
loved adding that into meals she has
tons of tropical fruits so I tried on
new things like passion fruit and it was
the other dragon fruit and I definitely
opened up my like my palate to different
fruits and they were all really
delicious so I mean no fruit is ever bad
though in my opinion so I definitely got
to try a ton of new things Oh
but along with sweet potatoes I've also
eaten more beans in my life than I can
imagine oh my gosh now I'm gonna go into
the workout so Arenado works out every
single day and what she does is she
makes shirts that one she gets in 10,000
steps every single day and - she does
she alternates three different workouts
she alternates 150 lunges backward
lunges so 150 Pike planks and 150
Superman so she does one of those every
single day let me tell you that was
rough I tend to work out two to three
times a week so going to seven days a
week was a little a little tough at
first I woke up many days and I was like
I can't do it my legs are gone but
of course just like everything it got
easier throughout the week especially
since I was alternating from my lunges
planks to Superman's because it's like a
whole different group of muscles so I
gave them still like two days of rest in
between 100 and 50 lunges though is
killer 150 Pike planks killer I commend
her for doing that all the time and
along without 10,000 steps sometimes
it's a little bit more difficult for me
to get my steps in so I didn't make sure
that like three or four times a week I
would go down to the treadmill and I
would like run or walk uphill so that
way I added in more steps because I
don't actually have anything to track my
steps and I didn't feel like I got
10,000 every day so I did make sure to
use a treadmill treadmill to add more
cardio and get my stuff set now when it
comes to my body I wouldn't say was
someone who needed to lose weight but I
also you could tell them to a for and
after that with the way that I did carry
it was around my stomach and I think
that shows that when they say that your
abs are made in the kitchen my ABS
completely were made in the kitchen
because I've always done tons of ab
workouts even before this Arianna thing
I did tons of ab workouts but once I cut
out all the processed food and literally
my stomach looked incredible like almost
after like four or five days I noticed
so much more definition and by the end
of the two weeks I was like oh my gosh
so that was definitely the boost I
needed to stick to a healthy lifestyle
and healthy diet
now before and after I definitely would
say there is a big difference
I have lost like an inch or so around my
waist my stomach is very toned very
defined
I think I'll I only lost like two two or
three pounds bite and I didn't want to
really lose any weight I just lost some
stuff around in my stomach area mainly
from my diet mainly bloating from all
the junk I was eating before I
definitely noticed up with a lift in the
booty area I've noticed that you know
more toned legs while walking I've done
like I said a slimmer face so I will say
so overall I would say have a super
super impressed with this and
happy with the result and I might test
Alec and other celebrities workout
routine I don't know I'm in the mood to
keep going I definitely think this
taught me to live a much healthier
lifestyle and just but I still want to
add in just a little bit of treating
myself every now and then cuz that's all
about a balanced life but I love you
