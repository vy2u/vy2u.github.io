or welcome if you happen to be new
today's video is going to be going to be
my I try to Beyonce's diet and I'm just
gonna go and tell you I failed I have to
try to diet and workout and I'm gonna
tell you all about like water diet is
why I failed what I should have done
differently and what who this diet is
good for everything so let's go ahead
and get started so what is Beyonce's
diet and workout routine well it's
actually changed a few times I've seen
different articles of her doing
different diets different workouts but I
found one from 2018 where she recently
talked about an article that her current
diet regimen was actually a keto diet
now keto diet is very different than a
lot of diets they are very popular I
know or if there's licking my arm right
now hi cutie I actually know a ton of
people that are very into the keto diet
so a keto diet is basically very high
fat very low carb now in this article
Beyonce did not specify if it was vegan
or not vegan however in 2015 she didn't
say that she was vegan back then or
mainly vegan and that during her like 22
day vegan diet plan she recommended so I
did still obviously since I'm vegan do
this in a vegan version which when I
found all the resources online I felt
like would be easy enough to do that I
could do it but when you start eating
lots of fats and basically not enough
carbs your body will switch to eating
fat for fuel and using fat for energy so
basically become like a fat-burning
machine I can eliminate a lot of carbs I
did not realize how many carbs are in so
many things even things like corn and
bananas have carbs in them black beans
garbanzo beans any kind of bean so many
different foods I was - I was used to
eating
I couldn't eat like I even messed up and
once had a coconut yogurt because it
said to get lots of coconut cream type
things so I got a coconut yogurt not
realizing that the yogurt I got
specifically had tons of carbs in it I
had tons of salad with avocado in them
avocado was a staple for everything I
ate with lots of veggies basically I
need a lot of veggies to keep myself
full and get enough greens and I also
did tons of tofu
and tempeh to get my protein and for
dinners I also did tons of just cooked
veggies I added avocado on the side
whenever I could I cooked everything
with coconut oil and I also added in a
lot of mushrooms to things when I could
because I saw they also recommend eating
a good bit of mushrooms alright guys so
currently I've got some cauliflower
mashed potatoes so now potatoes just
like mashed cauliflower I got to add
some vegan butter and some vegan cheese
and then over here I just put a little
bit on it and then over here I've got
some sauteed mushrooms a ton of
mushrooms some spinach and broccoli and
I also cooked this all in coconut oil
now where I went wrong there were two
times that I had a big ol fin which look
it's on the on the back and said it was
only 35 grams of carbs and I thought
that was fine but I found out when you
have that many carbs just from a bagel
thin with all the carbs that come in
from your vegetables and your fruits
that you eat during the day that it was
still too many carbs source at first I
felt really good
honestly heating all those avocados made
me feel really full I didn't expect to
feel as full as I did but I was fine I
did not feel hungry all the time I also
even tried a bulletproof coffee and I
actually liked it
I just woke up now I just went to class
he has to leave by like 7:30 and so I
was hanging out with them and being
adorable but I made bulletproof or
butter coffee my hair is a little
interesting so will be my first time
trying butter coffee okay it's kind of
fine it's actually not that bad
I was expecting to be like ah but hmm oh
so I got up at 7 ish and then I drink at
7:45 it's 10:00 usually by now I'm like
I need a second cup of coffee or nap I
feel the most I look I feel the best in
most week I've ever felt I got up at 7
a.m. had the coffee and then was awake
the entire day I felt great I felt
energized alert and then for my workouts
I did do yoga every day and I did a
cardio two out of the four day so I did
this now I'm not a huge cardio fan but I
still make myself do it on a regular
basis anyway it's because I like to just
make sure I can do it
and I have been doing yoga almost like
two at least two to three times a week
anyways since I did my testing Miley
Cyrus's diet and workout video so I have
been already doing yoga so it's pretty
easy for me to stick with her workout
routine but after about two to three
days I did start feeling pretty bad I
started feeling very groggy and my
stomach was hurting a lot so I decided
to reach out to a nutritionist so the
guy actually explained to me what was
happening in the keto flu is when your
body is switching into ketosis he said
you're gonna might feel really tired for
a day or so you might feel very groggy
your stomach might hurt but he said if
you push through it you will become into
ketosis or like transition into
ketosis and that is where the change
happens you said you'll initially lose a
lot of water weight and then your body
will just be like a healthy fat burning
mode and that's where you'll see all the
change from however I felt really bad I
went from honestly feeling so great for
two to three days about three days to
feeling so sick and the guy told me no
if you push through it you'll feel fine
but then he did tell me if you are not
planning on sticking to this keto diet I
would not go through it just to go
through it he said cuz then your body's
gonna be even
were confused when you go back to eating
carbs and I honestly knew that as much
as I liked the way I felt the first few
days I didn't plan to stick with it I
definitely liked a lot of the benefits
but I am someone who likes a lot of
things involve carbs and being vegan
there's a lot of foods that I already
can't eat and there's a lot of foods
that I need to eat or that I like to eat
that have carbs in them I think I've
always just been someone who likes to
have a healthy balanced lifestyle so I
definitely think I will be adding more
healthy fats into my diet like avocado
and coconut oil
I'm a stick and continue doing the
bulletproof coffee I'm gonna look more
into and find more research about it so
that is basically it that was my I tried
Beyonce's diet and workout definitely
not a bad bad plan but like for me it
just didn't work but I still love
Beyonce love me some Beyonce let me know
