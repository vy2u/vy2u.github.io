welcome if you are new today's video I
am testing out Megan Fox's diet and
workout now this is not her everyday or
even her current workout or no hurt note
as a current workout not her current
diet now this is going to be when Megan
Fox did the raw vegan diet that she does
occasionally so Megan Fox says she goes
raw vegan and she cuts out any added
sugar tries to avoid added salt anything
like that whenever she is trying to get
her body back on track yeah going raw
vegan for the day let's do it okay so we
are about to go to the gym for today's
workout I'm copying like a few things
from Megan Fox's workout so it says she
works out five days a week and each time
she works out she's a five factor
workout so first she does five to ten
minutes of cardio depending on the day
and then she does an upper-body circuit
like an arm circuit it says a lower body
circuit which is legs a core circuit so
something for her abs this court a blue
so like a core ABS thing and then she
also does a cool-down for five minutes
okay so we're back in time for breakfast
the breakfast is gonna be it's gonna
look a little sad cuz it is we're gonna
have more stuff for lunch so the plan
this isn't to eat my arm association the
point of this is not to eat huge
breakfast huge meal the point of it is
to kind of be eating all day because
they're not gonna be full a lot of times
I'm gonna be eating all day long which
is fine so then for my breakfast
smoothie it has oranges mangos pears
cherries apple so it's a lot of fruit
it's a pretty big smoothie hold on whoo
I'm also gonna go ahead and have a
banana and I'm also going to be drinking
half of this apple cider vinegar drink
this is the Apple Simon one we saw
always drink these in LA it's like the
cool thing there but they're good for
you and they taste really good it smells
bad tastes good okay so it's been a
little while not too long though I'm so
hungry
still we're gonna make a snack we're
gonna make some a black bean dip I just
got to get your protein in so we just
soaked some black beans like overnight
if we just have some soaked black beans
because they can't cook them and we are
going to blend them up blunders thing
we're gonna blend them up with a little
bit of like seasoning I think we can use
some seasonings I hope so a little bit
of garlic and stuff and then we're gonna
dip it with cucumber for a night snack I
don't know father up rescue line also
ever it's always a mess so we've got a
plate of a whole cucumber some carrots I
was really bad cutting it so I won't
show you we've got the bean dip I don't
know you should try please you should
try it first you should know you try
first
if you love me more if you love me more
all right first let's write I love you
more same time same time same time so
good
okay so I have a pretty simple salad I
didn't think about how many things you
can't eat for this so I have basically
just some spinach some cucumber in an
entire avocado hopefully that'll keep me
a little bit full fuller for a little
while and I'm also gonna put on some
walnut those are pecans actually got
some con pieces there's barely any left
of those mainly some pumpkin seeds I'm
also gonna be snacking on some
blueberries
I have a huge trouble bumps all wash
don't worry what's whole tub gonna eat
the whole titanium time hopefully pull
hello hangry
why don't you can do that make blended
and curry you know me very encouraging
mustard oh do curry curry okay okay fish
Island up up I'm tiny about a curry
powder but enough
I'm drinking a ton of Walker's with my
second one of these today okay that's
actually really good I'm on the line of
good hey guys I just didn't inhaled that
salad all so I just at least our
cabinets open sorry close that one
second I was grabbing the dogs treats um
that was actually really good I was so
grouchy and hungry but I feel really
good now I'm sure I'll be hungry pretty
soon but I will say this did which was
it so just some lemon curry powder on
some raw spinach cucumber avocado pecans
or pecan if you say pecan it's okay I'm
from Georgia give me a break pecans and
pumpkin seeds and I also ate a ton of
these blueberries and I'm not done
eating I'm probably going to sit here
and keep snacking for a little bit but
feel better now now today's video does
have a sponsor from Australian
excellence now this is actually a
product I use and love so basically this
is something that you take twice a day
just like two little tablespoons amount
of time and it promotes a healthy
digestion system they also have a pill
you can take this is the Australian
excellent Australian probiotic
excellence this also supports a healthy
digestive system it sets promotes immune
system and digestive health I'll be
honest I am someone who suffers with a
lot of indigestion issues there's a lot
of foods that bother me a lot of foods
that don't sit well with me honestly
these products have made a huge
difference in that I am no longer
bloated at all i actually haven't seen
my stomach bloated in like three weeks
I'm just gonna do two tablespoons it
looks like this it doesn't look the
books greatest but doesn't taste bad at
all
also coyotes good okay so when you open
these up they're just little capsules in
here like this and you just see you open
up for this little pills and here then
so I just pop one out
an even disease prevention there are
people who have taken these products and
see life-changing results so definitely
make sure to check them out I will have
links down below and if you haven't
gonna gut help I definitely recommend my
gosh Oh beautiful he's a pitiful and
adorable alright so it is now time for
my dinner I did actually have a little
bit more fruit for a snack earlier but I
forgot to vlog it to be honest but I am
having some dinner I'm actually feeling
fine right now I don't know why I was
bothering me so much earlier but I feel
okay right now I just have a huge bowl
of spinach a whole head of broccoli the
whole pepper and then I read a lot of
things aside could have soy sauce so I
put some soy sauce on it if I'm not
supposed to have soy sauce well I've
done really good today I think it's okay
this is definitely a good day to try it
when it's hot outside I could never do
this when it's cold like winter time Oh
obviously I don't hate this
think about it usually in the end of the
day it's when you are at your least to
find your least toned because you've had
a full day of eating you've been eating
food you lose a good bit of your
definition all of those photos you see
of fit girls taking photos of their
super defined stomachs they take those
photos in the morning before they've had
any food most of them will tell you that
and that is pretty much always the truth
because if the end of the day you just
typically don't look as defined as you
do in the morning but I want to show you
guys after a full day of eating this Rob
you know this is my stomach right now do
you see that there's still a little bit
of definition you can tell I just ate a
little full right here but do you see
that usually at the end of the day my
stomach gets like pushed out and it's a
little bloated there's definite no
definition like this like that's good
that's really really good friends a day
like you can still see even a little bit
of definition up here I am so impressed
I definitely could tell if you were to
try this out for a little bit longer
maybe a couple days or a week how you
could see some awesome results I
definitely feel like this could be a
great way to get your body on it to give
yourself like a healthy kick on to a
healthy lifestyle or maybe like a reset
if you're looking to reset your body
after a ton of junk food eating and you
want to kind of start over
kind of like doing the juice clense oh I
definitely could see its benefits for
try and get a little bit longer dunno I
am NOT a dietician not a nutritionist so
please consult with someone do your
research before trying anything of
anything like this out I also will be
taking tons of tips from Megan Fox's
worked out I love doing just 4 things a
ton of reps or tons of sets today versus
doing I usually do like one set of like
tons of different workouts I love just
focusing on those 4 workouts I feel like
I definitely got a good workout in today
so I'm definitely going to keep trying
