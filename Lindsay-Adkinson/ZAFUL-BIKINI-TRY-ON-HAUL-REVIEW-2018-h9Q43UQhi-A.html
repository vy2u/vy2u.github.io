or welcome if you happen to be new my
name is Lindsey Murray and today's video
is going to be trying on reviewing
showing you hauling you somes a full
example however you say it bikini so
before we get started a few updates
because one I haven't filmed in two
weeks because I was out of town and it
had pre filmed a bunch
lots of stuff is going on actually not
that much but number one is yes I did
cut off my hair again so in the past two
months I have went from like tape and
extensions that were like down to my
bellybutton to help my natural hair and
now I cut off my hair I know I've
mentioned this a million times I'm gonna
mention it again I am really trying not
really trying I am just being more
myself this year I for the longest time
was putting up content was I'm proud of
content that I was like embarrassed to
show people it was way too young for me
one thing I really like about myself in
real life is that I'm a pretty casual
relatable person I always go for the
easy route I don't I never wore those
extensions except for the Fellman for
photos because I thought I needed to
which is so weird but in real life I
never wore them I hated putting them in
so I took him out and then I realized I
wanted to make it even easier on myself
so I cut it off and I'm so excited for
it about it I love it I hope you guys do
too I am sticking with a red though the
redness like my favorite thing ever so
for today's video I'm giving away this
entire box of makeup I'm gonna insert a
picture here of everything you are
getting a point keep this going for
about a week I'll have all the details
down below but all you have to do to
enter this giveaway is one be a
subscriber to Tom turn on my
notifications and 3 leave a comment down
below ok so I have 2 bags here hopefully
my address wasn't on those two bags here
of swimsuits ok so twelve swimsuits
let's do this
so swimsuit number one is gonna be a
50/50 I'm not sure yeah I'm still
deciding uhh
so this is just a one-piece swimsuit
with a flamingo on it
I don't think it's bad material the
material is fine however it's a little
bit too big and it is a size small which
is what I normally get so it's just a
little too big look it doesn't it's not
very form-fitting in the back it doesn't
really stay so I don't know it's still
cute though I probably would wear this
more the body suit in a swimsuit just
because it is a little loose on me okay
okay oh okay okay oh sorry I know I love
this one okay so this is a piping
tropical print one-piece swimsuit this
one is 1899 they're pretty much all in
between 15 and 20 I like this one so
this one fit a lot better this one fits
wait waiting better than the first one
that this one I am 100% gonna wear this
is perfectly fits like a normal swimsuit
it's form-fitting not too tight it feels
really good it's really cute it feels
like a really high-end swimsuit like
this feels like great I'm just like
rubbing all over myself sorry this feels
like great quality um it's really cute
it's got tons of detail I love the
tropical print I love all like the
stripe cross print detail thing whatever
that is I love the straps it's got a
zipper in the front right here that
makes it like feel really really like
edgy and fun it's got really nice
padding other one didn't have padding
and 100% gonna wear this one yeah okay
so swimsuit number 3 that's 6 so if you
know what they're using knotted
scoop-neck white bikini also a thumbs up
so this one is very very simple but I
love simple white bikinis they make you
look really tan and I love it this one
is it's just a really soft and I
explained softer than most women since I
own it's very soft very comfortable
material it's got a cute little knot in
the front which is their trendy and I
love that the bats are not like super
cheeky so I'm very very happy with this
one I love this I'm so excited so it's
not it and I love how the top
not good level but like why do I keep
doing this like anyone wants to see me
do that so I thought something then like
two years ago and it was like okay I
bought stuff last year it was really it
was too good now this year it's like
this one is another great one this feels
like incredible
the material is so nice it feels so well
done it feels like a swimsuit
you could buy anywhere in any nice store
it doesn't feel like it's gonna fall
apart at all this is very well made I
love this I feel very confident in this
I definitely know I'm gonna wear this
the beach I'm not going to be worried
about the straps everything is nicely
made it is very very cute this is called
the cami one-piece swimwear I got it the
color deep blue this one is $18 so it's
like I miss I am excited for these
swimsuits I this is making me really
really excited for the warm weather okay
this one is so different from something
I would typically buy um but I like it
okay so I may have this on incorrectly
it looks like the straps go over top of
them and Oh bye hold on I'm gonna but
I'm gonna duck down and fix it okay so
wait okay so I think it goes like this I
don't think it's supposed to cross oh
that makes more sense
so the straps goes straight in the front
and then they cross in the back that
makes a little bit more sense it was
cute either way but this this is
probably a little cure the way it goes
this one is sixteen dollars so
definitely a steal for a swimsuit I
definitely gonna wear this one it's more
of a fun one really cool for a pool
party somewhere where you want to kind
of stand out definitely isn't the best
for tanning or like laying out cut type
weather if you're just want to get a tan
cuz you get some crazy lines but this is
a really cool definitely gonna do some
foot wasn't this one it's so cute
okay I love this one again really nice
quality this definitely feels like it's
art it's weird if I jump this is not
gonna fall it definitely feels like it's
tight-fitted definitely make sure for
this one though to get the right size
because it is
Sabino table not much elastic to it so
you know make sure you have the right
size this one actually fits me fine this
one is a little bit cheeky er than I
like but it's not too cheeky so it is a
little cheeky err than the other one so
it's not like terrible definitely not
like a thong I don't feel like I'm gonna
be super uncomfortable
I found ok so this is the banjo banjo
leopard-print oh this one actually does
say thong bikini so I couldn't even be
mad about the cheekiness on this one
because it technically says song bikini
but definitely isn't super super cheeky
so I think you could get away with this
I think I could be okay with this it was
18 bucks for the pattern alone I love it
definitely gonna work some photos in
this it'll take works and take some
photos and this okay that's really cute
this next one I'm gonna show you in a
second it's a definitely a very nice
quality a swimsuit prisoner definitely a
good quality I just don't know if it's
really like my style which obviously is
my fault because I picked it out I'm
gonna say young better you go but it
isn't good quality swim so it's very
very nice material it has really great
padding really nice straps are
adjustable it doesn't feel like it's
gonna fall off or fall apart it
definitely feels good quality again I
just don't know if this is a my style
but I picked it out so I don't know if
it is different for me so who knows
maybe maybe I'll still wear it okay so
the next one is a bit crazy for me this
is the leopard choker band l1 but I do
like it again it is very good good
material definitely feels high-quality I
love the leopard print itself I think
the only thing is I probably would not
wear the choker I'm actually gonna take
off but here yeah without the choker I
really like this one I definitely think
this is a fun swimsuit I love the
leopard print like I said leopard prints
really in right now
the choker dish probably was a little
not me but I do love this swimsuit and I
actually love the leopard print itself
it is very vibrant it's not like a dull
bird it's like a bright orange a leopard
print
Wow alright guys I feel getting this one
and I knew I would feel good in this one
oh my gosh so good so good okay so I do
feel good this one
because it is a very simple black
swimsuit this is actually made out of
that same cloth type material as the
yellow one so it's like that it's almost
like a fabric material which I'm a
little curious to see what that's like
when you go in the pool why don't you
will wear like crochet bikinis now so
I'm assuming they're fine this one also
comes with straps to add on which I do
love because I don't have to get to the
pool or the beach and you find that
you're pulling it up a few times I can I
do have to do that a few every now and
then so say you're going for like a like
a real swim and not just hanging out are
you about to jump in the pool and you're
like I don't want to take the chance of
something happening you can add these on
for a little added security so I like
that cuz you have a little bit of both
so very stable simple bikini just like
the white one I love plain black
swimsuit I feel like this is a really
good one to have
alright guys keep this up my stomachs
growling girls hungry okay so this line
it's a little talking to you again
what's going what are we working with
alright it's like 12 o'clock so weird so
this next one love it not to write it
that another simple swimsuit this is
pretty simple I like simple stuff it's a
cute little like almost like a maroon
pinkish maroon tie-dye this is probably
gonna be a very good like laying out at
the pool swimsuit because it doesn't
have crazy straps pretty simple I can
lay out in it
get a nice tan not too many tan lines
like this is by brent vibrant okay we
make it bright again okay so this is the
padded white strap bikini set in neon
orange I honestly kind of like it I
haven't had like a neon swimsuit sounds
like I don't know when I was like an
early college those were like remember
that like when it was like highlighter
swimsuits were like the thing I think
Victoria's Secret I had like neon orange
neon yellow neon pink neon blue and I
was all about it so not not about it um
I doesn't think I'll still wear this I
do wish maybe it wasn't as neon but
still have that big fan wow this is like
whoa it's it's neon I do love the
quality of this this is
very nice back not too cheeky for me I
love the straps
I love the whole feel of this it feels
very secure swimsuit in a really really
good one to end on because I love love
this one now the top of this one is a
little too big for me slightly but not
big enough where I'm not gonna be able
to wear it I can definitely jump up and
down and we're not going anywhere I just
might have to like do this once or twice
so probably no like deep ocean swims fun
fact I actually don't know how to swim
so that doesn't matter but I definitely
will be wearing this one this is so cute
I love white and green for swimsuits I
know that was really really in last year
and I hope it's still in this year
because I love these like tropical leafy
print patterns I think they're so pretty
I think this makes a very pretty
swimsuit I'm not like oh so cute but
like a pretty swimsuit and y'all need
something like that I love this pattern
I love how it's the white top and then
the pattern bottoms I was very very
excited for this one and they did not
disappoint thank you samples of pool
however you say it for coming through it
with this one suit very high quality
again feels like something you could buy
a Victoria's Secret I will have I will
go and link every single swimsuit I
purchased down below I am very very
pleased with all this I think there was
two there was one there are two that I
wasn't in love with but nothing that I
hated overall I definitely think when
they said they have worked on their
quality this year the last few years I
definitely haven't seen some major
improvement and I am having a giveaway
