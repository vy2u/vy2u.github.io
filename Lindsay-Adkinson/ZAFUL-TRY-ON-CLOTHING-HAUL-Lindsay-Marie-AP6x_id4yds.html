welcome if you're a new today's video is
a try on haul because I buy too much
stuff and because of you guys asked me
when I was doing my is a fool bikini try
on haul if I could try on some of the
fools clothes you're like well we get it
Lindsay that you just tried on 500
swimsuits we get through their swimsuits
you like them what about the clothes I
was like the point let's try this
so I thought a few things i didn't go
too overboard i just bought like 10
items but i thought i would show them to
you here today in this video so the
first thing that I got is this two-piece
set is a maroon to be said now I love
the short the shorts are great quality
and I do think the overalls I was like
burp on Cameron that was disgusting
hopefully you didn't hear that but
overall I do love the two-piece set the
only thing is the top is a little messy
like the sewing it's just a little messy
but overall I do think this two-piece is
really cute it's just the top it's a
little messy but you know I'm saying
with little stitches and stuff but it is
really cute and for the price I'm not
complaining I have actually won this a
few times and I do still like it next I
got this book soft dropship next I got
this top I think it is so cute is this
read over the shoulder top with cute
little ruffle sleeves it has like
separated sleeves from the top I think
things like this are so cute the sleeves
are like a mini bell sleeve it's got a
little slit on the chest that you tie at
the top so cute will be so cute like
some high-waisted shorts and then I
going to top it looks exactly like the
second the last one but it's a little
different this may say another over the
shoulder top with like a long bell
sleeve is a mustardy color it is so cute
I wore this with some white jeans
yesterday but some really cool like
jewelry I thought this was so pretty
actually wore this in my 20 outfits for
summer as well probably one of my
favorite tops right now I just realized
I was talking so fast slow down and then
I got another two pieces one is black
with sunflowers all over it you might
have seen this one on my Instagram that
I have worn it quite a few times these
shorts are really cute they're just like
zip up like high-waisted type shorts and
the top is just like those last two tops
and over the shoulder kind of a tube top
with the attached little sleeves
oh this set is my favorite thing of
everything I thought this nice thing I
don't know what I was thinking I don't
know what what I was thinking
it is this green leaf pattern direct and
I gotta be honest it feels like a
tablecloth it feels like it is literally
supposed to be a tablecloth that was
made into a dress I mean the quality of
it is really great the stitching is
really nice it doesn't look like it's
going to break or anything it's just the
this is so thick it feels like a
tablecloth there's a picnic tablecloth
you know what I'm talking about look if
you it just I mean that's what this
might be
I don't know I mean the actual pattern
is gorgeous the dress on a hanger is
gorgeous but on me ah this next dress
might be one of my favorite things it is
an over-the-shoulder
dress was detached sleeve and this one
is a lemon pattern and it's very flowy
it's got ruffles on the top this is kind
of different from my typical style I
would say but I'm really like loving
this it's so flowy and like comfy for
summertime it took a cute summer dress
and next I got this blue romper I feel
like this one the stitching is excellent
in this one actually has tiny little
Criss crosses like little cutouts and
that's something if something is made
cheaply usually you can tell and like
some detail stitching but now this
stitching is awesome like it's really
good the little bit of stitching up
close you want to know if you can see it
but it's just it's just done really well
it definitely looks like high-quality
something that I got it like a nice
really good store next I got this dress
which I'm not like crazy about but if
you like it just like a casual summer
sundress I do think the pattern is very
pretty it's a really pretty floral
pattern it does look a little bit
printed if you know what I'm saying
maybe print it on but it's pretty good
material it doesn't feel like it's going
to break it's kind of thin but I think
it's supposed to be thin
this is not see-through at all you
couldn't see anything and I didn't even
have a bra under this so I was like hey
that's a plus I do think this could be
really pretty for like you know it's a
casual Sunday like brunch or something I
don't know next I got a pretty casual
t-shirt it's just a big bully t-shirt it
says dreamer on it hold on it's inside
out it just does dreamer on it and it's
a cute little orange pattern some little
floral stuff on it
we'll have a lot of casual t-shirts
because I am cheap AF and casual
t-shirts can sometimes still be
expensive but this one was very
affordable so I was like alright let's
try this out I do like it comfy does the
job that's all that matters to me next I
got a gorgeous dress I love this is
again over the shoulder wispy a detached
leaves a little bit bell-like which is
very flowy it is actually like a
high-level high-low where it's like
longer and the back short on the front
cute little frills oh my gosh I think
this is so pretty I love the floral
pattern
I love the cutout in the front this is
so pretty like a date night me and know
actually have engagement photos on the
beach this weekend this is probably what
I'm going to wear and alas I got two
more things and they happen to be
swimsuits why because I'm psycho and yes
I know I have too many symptoms but I
bought them anyways whatever you know
why not go with it first I got this one
piece and it has really cool cutouts on
the side it's got like lace up detail on
the front it's like a leaf tropical
pattern I love this explain to wear this
soon because I want some photos in this
a very good quality very like normal
swimsuit quality I love it really pretty
you so the last one says I got it just
really cute two-piece I love it's got
really pretty like brown detail
everywhere like brown lace-up in the
back and stuff and brown like straps but
then it's also like it really pretty
like a blue it's like a blue chevron
pattern with a pineapple on top of it
like two patterns like a blue Chevron on
the back pineapple on top of the blue
Chevron I don't know but I was digging
it the bottoms are super cheeky let me
just tell you but sometimes I want to
like freeze the cheeks you know actually
no honestly I always try invites cheeky
swimsuits and they always chicken out
but I wanted this one maybe I'll braid
myself up and I'll wear it but it is
really cute
