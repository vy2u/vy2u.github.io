spring at casual go to outfits now I did
get a little bit of inspiration on how I
filmed this video from Allegra Shaw so I
will have her videos linked down below
but let's go ahead and get started now
for outfit 1 and actually partnered up
with RIT dye I love using RIT die to
revamp my clothing it is so easy
affordable and they're also non-toxic
now I had this old stained white crop
top that I didn't want to get rid of so
I just follow the instructions on the
RIT liquid dye and then followed up with
the color stay fixative which enhances
the color and reduces color bleeding and
now it looks like I have a perfectly new
shirt but you can find RIT Diet places
like Hobby Lobby Michaels Walmart and
Kroger and it makes changing or
revamping your clothes so simple and
easy I've used it for so so long and it
came out perfect for this first outfit I
paired my new RIT die fabulous t-shirt
with some very ripped up boyfriend jeans
from boohoo love these jeans and some
simple white tennis shoes white sneakers
are a staple for me because they
literally go with everything
Alvah - I wore these striped pants these
are actually pretty trendy right now as
well and just paired it with some black
flats and a black tank top obviously add
a jacket for any outfit if the weather
is cooler where you are
Alvah three I chose this mesh dress now
I love a comfy dresses and sneakers
I added my black vans and then I also
tied a plaid shirt around my waist I
think the shirt makes it even cuter
honestly plus it doubles as a light
jacket for the spring breeze
for outfit for I went for some holy
skinny jeans now these are from can-can
which is actually my favorite denim
brand and then I added this cute white
tank top that I actually found this
weekend at forever 21 and some slip ons
now those same white tennis shoes would
also look perfect with this I was
honestly just tired for a minute of
tying those shoes and slipping them on
home you can also add a cardigan if it
is cooler
alfe at 5:00 I chose this checkered
denim skirt you could also use any plain
denim skirt as well I honestly still
regret purchasing this one because it
was kind of pricey for me but like I'm
kind of cheap but I barely wear it but
okay but anyways I paired it with this
black tucked in t-shirt and some fans
but anyways any kind of like denim skirt
would work any kind of skirt would work
those kind of outfit outfit sticks I
went with some joggers and a tank top
bodysuit I also threw on those same
white great brand tissues outfit seven I
went a bit more girly for those of you
who like girly ER outfits and chose
these pink mob shorts I think I got them
from fashion OVA but I honestly lived in
these shorts last summer because they
are so comfy now I tucked in this white
blouse and of course those same white
tennis shoes outfit eight I went with
some denim shorts I can't ever forget
those and honestly I've had these shorts
for about three to four years actually
DIY them from an old pair of jeans a
long time ago and they just ended up
being my favorite I just tucked in a
black tank top with a fun oversized
button up that I thrifted for two
dollars and of course the same shoes
ALPA 9 is probably my favorite just
because I love graphic t-shirts but I
chose these black skinny jeans with a
graphic tee I feel like you can put
graphic tees with any outfit to make it
a little bit edgier and just a little
more fun and cool but I found this
pinking the brain' t-shirt at forever 21
and then just added my same band outfit
in is super simple but we can't forget
those of you who might be going on
spring break or a vacation you always
need a cute swimsuit and I found this
one-piece at forever 21 and I typically
will just throw on some cute denim
shorts with them and wear it as an
outfit now I totally should have put on
some flip-flops but I forgot them my
fault so that is it for my spring
