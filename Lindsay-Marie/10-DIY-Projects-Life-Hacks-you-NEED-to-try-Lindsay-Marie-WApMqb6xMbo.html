hi guys welcome back to my Channel today
I'm doing 10 DIY life hacks and just
project things that you need in your
life not these range from everything
from food to drinks to organization to
beauty products literally everything so
I have you covered for this summer these
are summer theme because it's about to
be summer so obviously I hope you guys
enjoyed this and without further ado
let's get into the video for this very
first DIY I am doing a DIY Frappuccino
all you want to do is add some coffee
some ice and some ice cream now you can
use any flavor of ice cream that you
want the flavors ice cream is going to
determine the flavor of your Frappuccino
or if you just want a plain coffee
frappe but then you don't add ice cream
and instead you just add milk and sugar
if you want then when you're done you
just blend it all up and you have a nice
frozen Frappuccino which is a lot
cheaper than Starbucks
next DIY is my favorite summertime snack
you just want to take a peach cut it up
put it on a baking tray and then put it
in the oven on 350 for eight minutes you
can also drizzle a little bit of honey
if you want and this is my all-time
favorite snack in the summertime and hey
it's good for you the next DIY is just
some ocean water are you gonna do is
take water and add some neon blue or
regular blue food coloring shake it up
and mine is super neon and then you're
gonna add some fruit I did watermelon so
my water tasted like watermelon but look
like the ocean this is perfect for
summer parties or just for fun now this
is for all those times you make all
those summer plans and then you don't
stick to them what I'd like to do at the
beginning of summer is take a bunch of
pieces of paper and write down all the
things that I want to do for summertime
whether it's small things or crazy
adventures and i'ma stick them all into
some kind of container I actually chose
a fishbowl because I found one at
Michaels I set them all into a fishbowl
and then whenever it needs something to
do i'm going to pick them out of my bowl
so it's sort of like a bucket list for
summer in a bowl
for this DIY I'm is cutting out the
leftover candle in a candle jar and then
I'm going to fill it up with candy paint
the lid put the lid on top and have a
really cute storage container you can
put anything inside of your holder I
just decided to use mine for candy
because who doesn't have a sweet tooth
tonight something's in the air something
next I just add some sugar maybe a
little bit of salt if you want i just
did sugar and a little bit of coconut
oil into a jar mix it up and i scrub
this all over my body and sometimes a
little bit on my face and then you have
a really easy really quick really good
exfoliator next I'm doing a moisturizer
which is just honey and coconut how easy
is that I mixed the honey and coconut
oil together and then I will apply this
onto my skin I don't normally do it
after i exfoliate I leave it on for 5 to
10 minutes rinse it off and my skin is
baby soft I don't know about you but I
always get my keys mixed up so what I'd
like to do is for my most important key
like my house key I just like to color
it with a little bit of paint or
sometimes I'll even use a sharpie
afterwards and put like a letter on it
like h4 house and then I have a really
cute personalized key and I'm never
going to forget which one is which
next this is really cute really really
easy personalized mug you just want to
put down some sort of stencil I did an
elf or Lindsey obviously then I took a
bunch of sharpie markers and I
polka-dotted all the way around the
stencil I just did a really scattered
pattern but you can do whatever you want
and then when you're done you just want
to peel off your stencil let it bake in
the oven for like 5 to 10 minutes i'll
put the exact baking stuff down below
and then you have a really cute
personalized mug which is great for
gifts are also just great for yourselves
like i did this next one is my favor the
camera cut off but i can still like
basically tell you everything first I
just take a little bit of wire and I
wrap it around until the wire is a
complete circle that is going to fit my
head basically your initially making a
flower crown and then once i have it
formed into a circle i'm going to take a
bunch of flowers and I'm literally just
going to tape them down you don't need
to glue them because they're gonna be
hidden you'll see in just a minute I'm
going to type all the flowers down
around my wire and once I have taped all
of my flowers down I'm going to force it
on top of a really cute hat I got a
floppy hat from walmart for four dollars
so I'm going to push this down onto my
hat and then I have a really really cute
summer hat that has a nice little flower
crown added to it and it's really cute
for summer and really easy to do I got
my flowers by the way at the dollar
store for less than two dollars
