or welcome if you are new my name is
Lindsay Marie and today's video is going
to be 10 or 9 fashion mistakes now quick
disclaimer before you watch this video I
had noticed right before I filmed this
video that there were two other girls
that did videos just like this one and I
was like oh maybe I shouldn't film it
but I thought about it and I was like
you know what I have been planning this
video for a very long time I actually
plan out my videos like a month in
advance and also I decided to watch both
their videos and we actually all have
very different fashion mistakes so I was
like okay awesome I'm still gonna film
my video so like I said there are two
other videos out there that like have
the same title and stuff but if you
watch all of ours are actually pretty
different I will still link both of
their videos down below so if you want
to watch theirs after mine you can get
learning even more fashion mistakes
anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this
video please give it a thumbs up and
subscribe if you are new and let's go
ahead and get started now my number one
fashion mistake is actually listening to
other people's style tips and thinking
you have to follow them now it's kind of
weird because this is a fashion mistakes
video but honestly I have watched tons
of videos like fashion mistakes and
style tips and fashion hacks and
clothing hacks and I'm like oh my gosh
they have a different opinion than me oh
my gosh that means I was wrong no no no
no no girl what it means is we all have
different opinions that's why when I
make fashion type videos I try to keep
it very vague because I don't anyone
ever thinking that their style choice
that their fashion choice is incorrect
because that's the good part about
fashion is when it comes to how you
dress there aren't really any mistakes
there isn't a wrong or right way to do
anything you should dress however the
hell you want to dress whatever makes
you feel good so if someone says you
can't match this with this I don't care
what they say if you like wearing that
with that girl you rock it because that
is what fashion is all about number two
is assuming your shoe size this is me my
whole life
still now I gotta work on this I have
always just thought I was a size 7 shoe
and so that was what I would do I was
like I'm a size 7 shoe and that's just
me also I totally just noticed my
neighbors are watching me out in their
window next door so I'm like that's
awkward I can see them but I'm just
gonna keep going ok so I'm like I
the size 7 shoe but I also thought that
I didn't know how to walk in high heels
every time I walked walked in high heels
I was like okay this is this is very
uncomfortable
my feet were kind of like sliding in and
out they were like all over the place I
was always getting blisters and then I
found out that is because I may be a
size 7 in tennis shoes but I like a six
and a half sometimes a six and high
heels
just because you are one shoe size and
one shoe does not mean that stands for
every single shoe number three is
actually something that my friend
Deborah taught me she's also a youtuber
I'll link her down below shout out to
Deborah for teaching me to not shock
when you're tired when you're tired you
are more likely to just buy things
without trying them on without really
deciding if you wanted you're more like
hungry and bored and ready just to get
over it you're just like throwing things
off the hangers like I'm just gonna take
all this so make sure to shop with you
have a full stomach
when you're in a good mood when you're
awake and if you notice that throughout
shopping you're getting kind of tired
and down and not really like kinda
gettin lazy with it then take a break or
maybe like call it quits for the rest of
the day
number four is pretty simple but try
everything on in the store that's
another thing if you're too lazy to try
it on the means don't shop that day so
try everything on because you never know
how something is going to fit don't shop
for a certain size okay I whenever
anyone asks for my my clothing size I'm
like I don't know I just try things on
you should really don't look at a label
don't let a number to find you who cares
about what they said what numbers say
anyways you know we're all freaking hot
so what you need to do is just try your
clothes on because just because
something says it's a size four doesn't
mean it fits like every other four
the next one is small stains and
wrinkles I was really bad about this for
a very long time I was I'm still so
freaking lazy then I would just go out
with all these wrinkles on and stains on
them when I met my beautiful fiance he
was like do you know that like stain
removed for those little stain pins like
a dollar at the gas station did you know
you can buy a steamer for like 10 15
bucks and I was like what so now I
invested in a steamer I have like one of
those little stain or moving pins in my
bag
whenever I like drop pizza or coffee on
my shirt which is every time I wear
white I can easily get that out and also
I make sure to wrinkle release my
clothes before I go
and that little bitty step really makes
my outfit looks so much more put
together and I feel so much more
confident and that is always a plus
number six is accessorizing that is my
favorite part of actually getting ready
I talk about this all the time but I can
go out and like I love wearing like
jeans and just a plain white tank top
adding on some accessories and calling
it an outfit because girl that is an
outfit I'm not gonna say what kind of
accessories what to do or what not to do
but I'm just saying accessorize in
general figure out what accessories you
like and try playing with different
different person's sunglasses scarves
hats jewelry so many different things
you can accessorize with they can like
change up and outfit it make it so fun
you can literally take one pair of jeans
and a tank top and we're at five million
different ways depending on how you
accessorize it and the next one is
wearing painful shoes I do this I
honestly still do this like this is a
fashion mistake I have got to like tell
myself to stop doing wearing painful
shoes and then regretting it later on
I'm not saying you can never wear those
painful shoes that you really want to
wear but maybe wear them for a very
small event somewhere where you won't be
walking too much so often I'm going to
cute places and I'm like oh my god I
want to win these shoes but they're so
uncomfortable and then after walking for
five million years it seems like my blip
my feet are all blistered and bleeding
and you know it's also at the pain for
me but it's also pain for everyone else
because they're all hot they're all
having to listen to me complain another
thing is over investing in things you
cannot wear very often or use very often
now I'm not saying you can't splurge
girl it is your money you'll finances
splurge on what you want you want to go
splurge on a big mac and girl splurge on
a big mac if you want to splurge on a
purse birds don't splurge no first I
just had a Big Mac I don't know I've
never had a Big Mac to be honest but you
know what I'm saying sorry time what you
want to splurge on but I'm saying it is
better to splurge on items you can reuse
versus items that you can use once or
twice like for example a purse that
looks like that it's like pink orange
yellow green and blue it may look really
cool but more often than not you're only
gonna wear it a few times and you're I'm
gonna be like dang it why didn't I get
the brown purse that I could wear it
every day and last not least is wearing
stuff it doesn't make you feel 100%
confident any you just because you've
seen it all over Instagram just because
you've seen that as popular does not
mean that you have to wear it
just because someone else just because
even if I tell you need to wear
something does not mean you need to wear
it if you don't look in the mirror and
say oh girl ha then you shouldn't wear
it you want to look in the maybe not
that exact phrase but if you want to
feel 100 percent you and confident every
single day life is too short to feel
like yeah I will be responding to every
single comment the very first day and
probably a few days after and always
respond to so many comments because it's
so much fun honestly my favorite part of
the day
