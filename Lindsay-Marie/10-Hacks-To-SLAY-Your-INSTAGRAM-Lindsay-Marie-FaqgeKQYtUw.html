better okay my hair is literally a mess
Oh like my life huh hi guys how's it
going - hope it's going well today's
video is going to be my Instagram
secrets this has everything from some
editing secrets to some Instagram story
secrets lots of different things you
guys love my last Instagram video so I
want to keep this series going so make
sure to hit that subscribe button if you
are new to never miss my Instagram
videos or any videos that I upload and
let's go ahead and get started
now first before we get started I really
want to I can't stress enough how much
you have to understand your Instagram
following does not represent your worth
your Instagram followers does not mean
you are better than someone or not as
good as someone so please don't ever
think that don't obsess over social
media and let it make you think that you
aren't as good as someone else or that
you know that anything like that because
I have done that I have spent countless
hours looking at girls on Instagram and
thinking oh my gosh I'm not pretty
enough or I'm not funny enough with this
or that and it's not healthy cuz you are
beautiful funny
you have a great personality just how
you are being yourself is the best thing
you can do and just know that everyone
is meant to be themselves and be
different so don't worry about comparing
yourself to other people just worry
about yourself and always being happy
and I love you guys and now let's
actually get started number one is how
you can do a blank page on an Instagram
story now for the longest time I was
taking photos on my hand or like a black
table to able to be able to get like a
blank page on Instagram well there's
actually an easier way to do this all
you have to do is take a photo of
anything then after you've taken a photo
on Instagram story you just want to go
to the colors like in the drawing
section choose the color you want for
your background hold down your screen
and voila you have a color background
for any kind of text on Instagram
stories no more using your hand if you
didn't know this you're welcome I
learned this like a few days ago and I
was like oh my gosh
number two is more of answering a
question because everyone asked me how
do you be able to swipe up to be at two
different ways one you have to be
verified number two you have to have
tint
followers on Instagram and have a
business profile so if you have 10,000
followers and you can't swipe up all you
have to do is go into your settings and
change it to a business profile and you
can swipe up number 3 is using
collections collections aren't a new
thing on Instagram and I love them if
you're someone who likes Pinterest and
likes to save things use the collections
if you're looking for new photo ideas
ideas and pose ideas anything like that
use the collection tool I have my
collection tool with a few different
folders and I love to save different
photo ideas for photos of me and Noah
photos of myself pose ideas photos with
friends locations and I'm traveling all
state locations that I want to go to
number four is to take the time to get
comfortable in front of the camera that
will change your photo game if you want
to take good photos get comfortable in
front of the camera
that means a practice makes perfect
spend more time doing things I can front
of the camera more time taking photos
with friends so you get more comfortable
and number two do fun things while
you're taking photos to make yourself
more comfortable and loosen up for
example I like to play a lot of music
funny music that really gets me in the
mood before you know I'll go from like
awkwardly posing and not feeling very
comfortable too
loosey goosey and I would just like
posing away and I feel so much better
about it so do something that makes you
have fun while you're taking your photos
I promise you you'll see a difference
the next one is using hashtags correctly
I didn't think there was a correct way
to using hashtags the most efficient way
and I think that is one of using
hashtags that are only relevant to your
photo and B you try try finding some
hashtags that are highly searched but
maybe don't have as many people using
them maybe look for new new trending
hashtags because that can help you get
seen a little bit easier also if you're
looking to grow your Instagram make sure
you're using the locations locations can
really help more people find you
whenever I'm traveling or go to a new
location I love using the location tool
and putting where I'm at and I'll notice
I'll get a lot more followers engagement
in likes from that area make sure to
also use a hashtag
in locations and your Instagram story
you can now be featured on other
Instagram stories just like you could on
snapchat and I've had tons of success
using the hashtags for certain events
going on and putting my location when
I'm somewhere and gaining a lot more
followers that way if you're having
trouble with a theme then try sticking
to a very simple theme that's what I do
right now I was having trouble staying
with one so I just have a very simple
theme where I take all of my photos in
good natural light I edit them very
simply just in Lightroom I do not use
any vsco cam filters right now I just
edit them in Lightroom and then all I do
is I whiten my whites and that's
actually really easy you can whiten your
whites in lightroom using the teeth
whitening tool or you can also just use
the facetune app on your phone and just
whiten your whites that way and that is
a super easy way to have a really nice
theme next if you're trying to have a
really nice cohesive theme try using an
app that shows you a good order for your
photos I use the app preview I think
there's another one called on as well
but I guess preview and what I do is it
loads all of my current Instagram photos
into the app and then I can just upload
other photos on to the app and see which
order looks best and that has helped me
so often like I may have really wanted
to post a photo but I realized if I
switch it around just a little bit my
feet will look a lot better
that's not least is to try and get
photos reposted as well as networking
with other people say you're starting
out as an influencer and people want to
send you stuff but they aren't wanting
to pay you maybe ask them hey if you're
gonna send me this would you mind if I
post a photo you can repost it and that
can really help you grow your feet it is
kind of like a nice collaboration where
they're getting something but you're
also getting something in return all
right yeah it's not as everything for my
Instagram and tips and secrets if you'd
like another video more like an in-depth
video on how I edit my photos just look

know in the comments and maybe I'll do
