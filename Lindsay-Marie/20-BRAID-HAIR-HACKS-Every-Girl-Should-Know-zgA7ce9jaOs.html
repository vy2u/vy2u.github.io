channel that's a little too far so
today's video is at 20 braids hairstyles
and hacks in tips and tricks cuz I'm not
sure what makes something a hack like
what makes something considered a hack
I don't really know so I'm like scared
to call things hacks because then I have
like the people that like the hater
comments and be like it's not a hack and
I'm like I mean there are hacks and tips
to make your braids last longer make
them easier but there's also going to be
easy braids that you can do for your
hair as well there's a lot of them so
yeah it's gonna be a fun video I hope
make sure give it a thumbs up if you
want to see more hairstyle hacks I was
think about doing a 20 Beauty hack soon
let me know um and let's go ahead and
get started
number one is a start with dirty hair
now some people get so about dirty hair
no that's fine it's fine I'm currently
working on day three it's just work
better on dirty hair it gives them more
texture more of a grip and they just it
just works
number two is using dry shampoo now even
if you decide to braid your hair on a
clean hair day I would still use a
little bit of dry shampoo that really
makes it my roots a lot more voluminous
and I like to have a lot of volume or a
good amount of volume I'm just using my
dove dry shampoo this one works best for
me honestly the third thing is using
some argan oil this is just my nume
argan oil even though you want your hair
to be dirty and messy you also still
want it to be healthy this is also gonna
add a lot of shine it's going to keep
your hair a little bit smoother and hold
it together so I'm going to use a little
bit of my nume argan oil now the last
thing I like to do before I go on with
my braids I like to curl my hair a
little bit now I like the reverse one
because it's tighter at the top the
Jackpine is really great because of the
top of my hair typically doesn't hold
curl as much so since it's tighter it's
going to fall a lot slower which I love
now the first one I like to do is a two
strand braid so many people do like
three and four and five strand braids
but why not simplify and do a two strand
braid the four is two strand braid I'm
just going to start off by sectioning my
hair into two strands I'm going to take
the back section and I'm going to make a
hole in between this I'm just going to
make an O
in the back section of my hair I'm going
to take the front section and pull it
through that hole pretty simple I'm
going to keep repeating the same exact
process so this is a completed two
strand braid I love this it's super
simple I think it's actually really nice
if you have like thinner hair and you
don't have enough hair to do with three
strand braid if your three strand braid
is like super thin you can do a two
strand braid so your strands are a lot
thicker it still looks like a three
strand braid it's really like unique
it's really simple and yeah super easy
in voila
alright the next one is this really cute
fishtail up to type thing you want to
take one small strand from each side so
one like a from the front and the back
of your hair a little bitty strand you
want to bring it together in the middle
and you want to tie it with the elastic
and now once you tie it off with an
elastic you just want to flip the little
ponytail you made inside out and now you
just want to keep repeating this process
okay so this is the completed look and
now that I've done I actually really
like the colorful bands I think I prefer
the colorful bands I just love it so
yeah this is the second easy hairstyle
next if you're wanting to go for that
like a braided bang look and you don't
really want to go through the hassle
trying to like French braid your bangs
or something just twist them instead and
pretty much kind of unless someone's
like right up close you can't really
tell at my opinion so what I like to do
is just take a section of my bangs right
here I'm just going to separate them
into two different sections I'm going to
twist both sections of my hair now you
simply just want to twist them around
each other now this is what you could
leave it just like this for the next
hairstyle that what you can also do is
break this or continue twisting this all
the way down I'm actually going to add
this into a regular braid and kind of
hiding
I'm going to just do a regular
three-strand braid it gives a cute
little illusion it also keeps your hair
out of your face super simple easy cute
and fun now if you're like me and you
have trouble getting all of your hair
into your fishtail braid I do this all
the time I'll braid my hair or I'll
fishtail braid it and in the end I'll
find like 5 million pieces that I missed
so what you can do is put your hair into
an elastic first and then you can
fishtail braid it from the ponytail and
now all you have to do is take this
little piece out you have a perfectly
put together fishtail braid you've
probably heard this one a million times
but I figured I would add it in anyways
literally just pull your braid apart you
can make it as thick as you want no
matter how thin your hair is you can
make your braid look super thick now
another thing you can do is turn your
braid into other hairstyles I'm just
going to stick with the fishtail braid
that I already started but you can
simply just wrap this on top of your
head if you want so as you can see you
can do it both sides you can pin it on
the side that you braided it or also on
the opposite side you might want to tuck
these little pieces in actually just to
make it look a little bit more put
together that's better now you can also
take the braids you didn't turn it into
a bun so I'm going to do is take my
braids I'm going to wrap it around
itself I'm going to take a bigger like
an actual hair tie I'm not going to use
an elastic for this go this is a lot of
hair I'm just going to put the bun in
place with my camo and now you have this
really cute soft and like romantic type
bun looks a lot more put together than
like a regular messy bun now have you
ever seen those really cute four or five
even six strand braids I have and
they're insane now I could show you how
to do those but that's really confusing
and it can be like it can get really
confusing you're like what am i doing
and so what you can also do is just take
your hair and split it into two sections
I'm going to put the first section in
the back for a minute and I'm actually
just going to braid this first section
into a regular three strand braid and
now I'm going to take the back section
I'm also going to do this into a three
strand braid as well and now what you
can do is take these two braids and put
them together with one elastic so I'm
going to take both the two braids and
put it lastly at the bottom to hold them
together and now I'm going to take a
bobby pin
I'm going to pin the two braids together
in the back where you can't see the
bobby pin and then once you're done you
have this really cool intricate looking
five or six strand braid appearance but
really it's just two braids that are
pinned together but no one's going to
know the difference
now this next one isn't even really a
braid but something I like to do is take
all my hair onto one side put it in an
elastic like so and then I like to just
go down about an inch and keep putting
my hair into other elastics it's not
even actually a real braid but it looks
really cool to me it looks like a braid
from far away like to me I can't mess
them up close I'm not going to know that
someone didn't braid their hair I just
think it looks really cool I consider
like a faux braid if that makes sense I
think it's a full braid now this next
braid is basically the same concept
except once you have your hair into the
first elastic you want to make a hole
above the ponytail and you want to pull
all of your hair through and I'm going
to just keep doing this down my ponytail
would add another elastic about an inch
or two down and make sure the elastic is
pretty tight and I'm going to separate
my little bubble here into like a little
hole right here like a little donut and
pull the rest of my ponytail through and
then tighten it up now obviously you
could leave it just like this but I like
to go one step further and take out the
elastics except for at the bottom one
now here goes like my next tip or trick
or hack or something instead of whatever
Brady are doing at the end of the day
don't just pull out those elastics from
your hair that's actually super bad for
your hair and if you notice when you
take those elastics out you probably
have a ton of hair stuck to the elastic
and it took a lot of your hair out it
broke a lot of your hair and that's
really damaging so what I like to do is
take these little mini scissors and I
like to pull the elastic away from my
hair I like to make sure I have no hair
in my fingers just the elastic and then
I like to cut it just like that and the
elastic comes right off and then if my
hair comes off with it so now you have a
much cuter version of that braid I think
someone called this the Jasmine braid
one time another thing you can do is
what I just did and take out the bottom
elastic so you just have this top little
fishtail and then you have like this
little fishtail ponytail which I
I think is really cute so it starts out
as a fishtail then it ends it's just
like a regular side pony really cute way
to have your hair look a little bit more
put together like you took some extra
time into the side ponytail but I think
this is super cute I do this actually
all the time alright guys so that was my
