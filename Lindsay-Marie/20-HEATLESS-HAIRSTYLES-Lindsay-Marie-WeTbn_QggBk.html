to my channel today's video is going to
be 20/20 back-to-school hairstyles
obviously here one else these will work
for like multiple high school college
and even going to work and honestly just
every single day the definitely matters
either just 20 keyless hairstyles I
thought were great for back-to-school or
any time that you are running late or
you just don't want to put heat on your
hair they don't take too much time but
they're still super cute and look a lot
more put together than just like a
greasy ponytails like I do all the time
anyways oh I do have a giveaway going on
for the entire month of July if you'd
like to enjoy that make sure to check
out the description box down below make
sure to give this video a thumbs up and
let's go ahead and get started number
one is just a simple side braid I'm just
taking three strands of my hair on one
side of my head pulling out my bangs
maybe it's criss crossing those three
strands on top of each other until I
have a full side braid number two we
have our fishtail pigtail braids I love
these I think they're so cute they take
almost no time I just separate my hair
onto both sides of my head and I take
one strand at a time and I will fishtail
it what you do is you just separate one
section into two and take little pieces
from each side and cross zones over to
the other side you got all the way down
at the strand of hair and then at Keio
is an elastic and repeat on the other
side to the other strand of your hair I
also like to mess mine up a little bit
pull out my bangs and voila super cute
and ready to go
no idea why I decided to do all of my
braids at the first by getting but
anyways for this next one I was taking
all of my hair to the back of my head
and I'm doing a huge three strand braid
you can do it pretty messy if you'd like
I kind of had to but didn't have a
mirror up and I just finished it over in
the front so I could see it better hide
it with an elastic pulled it back to the
back of my hair and here this really
cute thank you
braids in the back your head he doesn't
like a lower ponytail I think it was
super fun I do this pretty often next
one this is the cheat fishtail braid
it's super super easy just put an
elastic at the top of the strain of your
hair make a little hole in the middle
and pull your hair through like you see
I'm doing here and then repeat the same
thing around looks like two inches down
on your strand of hair just make a
little pole between your hair kind of
like a donut and pull the Strand through
and then you have this just fake looking
a little fishtail braid you can do
multiple if you like but I kind of just
like doing - I think it looks like a
cute little almost like an up - number
five is a simple way to get your hair
out of your face I just like to take a
huge section of my hair crisscross it
around the back in bobby pin it in place
and do the same thing with the other
side and as you just bobby pin that
piece in place as well obviously if out
a mirror I would have hidden my bobby
pin a little bit better but you get the
idea
super cute very Rapunzel like or
princess like and I think this is super
pretty and very boho as well this next
one is something I like to do on days
when my hair is like naturally wavy or
something maybe it's like second day
curls or something but then just a few
of my hair a few pieces later are a
little messed up from sleeping what I
like to do is just take those pieces are
kind of a little messy and I will just
add a braid to them and then topsail out
the rest of my hair so it looks like
it's like bedhead
naturally messy and then it looks just
kind of like this I think it's super
cute and an easy way to hide those messy
bedhead ways
next you have your half-up half-down
sweet fun I took out my extensions for
this one so mine were a little smaller
I just section my hair on the top into
two little sections twisting my hair
into two little buns and then bobby pins
it into place and then you just cool
again kind of play around with them if
you get the desired fun that you like
pull out your bangs like I do as always
and there you go
super cute next to see half-up half-down
top knot bun all I do is take the top
section of my hair and I will flip it
around into a top knot tie it with an
elastic sometimes I will secure it with
a bobby pin messing around until it's
like my desired fluffiness I'll pull out
my hair make it a little bit more
voluminous and you are done next is all
my favorite ways to do a simple ponytail
I would have put all of my hair into a
messy pony
come on my bangs as usual I could say
that every single time and then I'll
just take the back part of my ponytail
I'll add a simple braid and once I'm
done I will pull the braid apart to make
it a little bit bigger I think that adds
a little bit of extra to your ponytail
so another way to spice up those Cloney
tails is to add a bandana I use one for
the college campus that I live at with
the school that Nell goes to I just wrap
it around my head and then I just tie it
in the front or the top I usually double
knot it so it stays in place I make my
ponytail super voluminous and there you
go this is all my favorite ways to rock
the ponytail this is super super cute
this next one is a really simple braided
bun all you do is take your hair to a
lower side and to a simple three strand
braid you can do a fishtail braid for
feeling adventurous but I'm always super
lazy so I just do the simple brain wrap
around into a knot and then I will bobby
pin it in place and add an elastic and
you have a super simple side buttons a
little bit of extra spice in the braid
number three I just took three strands
at the top of my head I twisted them
around like so and then I added an
elastic and then I just left them kind
of like that it's just a super simple
way to get your hair out of your face I
think this is so fun
number thirteen is my typical messy bun
all I do is take all my hair into one
big section and I will just loop it
around itself as you can see I'm doing
here I will tie it down with a big
ponytail and then I would just literally
pull on it until I have a really cute
bun that I like I will also pull them at
the scalp area of my hair just to make
it a little bit more voluminous and
after you do a lot of cooling it comes
out like this and I love my bun like
this next this is super cute bandana
like up to you take your bandana and
wrap it around the crown of your head on
top of your hair you can also use a
scarf or something as well or a headband
and then I just tied it in place and
then I made sure that all of my hair was
but kind of like not too lumpy on top of
the bandana and I supposed to rest of my
hair and literally dust it into the
bandana sorry that I kind of went out of
frame here but it's pretty simple you
kind of literally stuff your hair into a
bandana pull out your bank and give this
super cute like almost looking up to
sister fun and really cute and if you
wanted to do something similar to the
last one but maybe leave some of your
hair down like a half-up half-down you
can also just tuck your hair if your
bangs into the bandana as well
especially just to get them out of your
face and that looks just as cute so next
we have your typical space buns I just
parted my hair right down the middle and
I took one strand at a time and wrapped
it around itself like so and then once I
was done I would use an elastic to hold
it down and then also I will just move
the bun around until I have exactly how
I want it to be you can also add bobby
pins basically just pull on it until you
have the bun new one and you're done
super cute I don't know I always do
think this is like a super hard hairdo
and I finally figured out it like super
easy and I love doing space buns
for the next one all you do is start
with the top of your head and you start
twisting your hair all the way down and
grabbing more hair as you twist until
you come to the end of your hair and
then you want to take that strand of
hair you also want to twist that and
twist that hair and also twist it into a
little bun and then use your elastic to
hold it down and do the same thing on
the other side and we skip this really
cute like twisted bond that also starts
all the way from your bangs but connects
from your bangs to the bun I think this
is super simple super cute but it looks
like you're super like put together this
next one was one of my favorites back in
high school in college I just take all
of my bangs and I braid them into a
regular braid and I take the rest of my
hair and put it into a messy bun I did
like the simplest easiest messy bun like
this and love when the hairs stick out
the tops when I get like messy on
purpose and then that's literally it
and you're done
for number 19 we have our simple low
pony I love this with long hair so I did
have my extensions in for this one all
you do is take your hair to the back end
and tie it with an elastic and I also
like to pull on it a lot to make it very
flexible luminous and bouncy pull out my
bangs you can also add some cute
earrings and voila now our last one is
our French braid ponytails now I'm not
gonna lie I'm not the best at these I
didn't have a mirror side that's why I
put this last because I'm not the best
basically you just part your hair into
like two sides down the middle and you
will French braid each side basically a
French braid is just a regular braid
where you take more hair every single
time when you cross it over there are
plenty of tutorials online if I'm
completely confusing you I'm sure I am
but I basically just French braid it
both sides all the way down and when I
got to the nape of my neck
I added my elastic and just left them as
little pigtails I have to decide wrong
on line I did say I just think it came
out really cute I obviously just you to
practice this one a little bit more
