to need is a comb or a brush and a
headband now first you just want to
start by combing off the hair on your
crown backwards and if you're like me
where your your crown doesn't really
want to brush backwards you might have
to tease it just a little bit okay now
once you have all of your hair brush it
back I leave my bangs out and then like
a little piece on both sides next you
just want to take your headband and
place it around the crown of your head
and you just want to take all of your
hair twist it just a little bit now if
you have really thick a really long hair
you might do this in like two sections
but I have thin here so I'm just doing
it in one section and you just want to
take all of that hair and stuff it like
inside of the head Mia I have a really
simple really cute headband here so it's
almost like an updo you could wear this
to like like a casual wedding you could
wear this out on a date you can wear
this just really everyday hair for the
second hairstyle it's super easy all you
want to do is bring all of your hair to
one side of your head and you just want
to separate your hair into two sections
like this and you're just going to take
both sections and tie your hair into a
double knot so I'm going to literally
just tie my hair like wrap the piece
around and then bring it through like
I'm tying a shoelace tighten it really
good i'm going to do that one more time
now you have these two separate little
pieces you just want to bring them
together it's like a little elastic
alright and that is the finished second
hair silently often will add like a
little headband or something or maybe
like a little clip or something like
that but this is the gist of it and the
main points of the hairstyle now for
this third here so I'm going to be
sectioning my hair into about four or
five sections depending on how much hair
you have if you want to leave your bangs
out i recommend doing so before you
start this one and know what i'm going
to do is take each section i hope you
can see this and i'm going to twist it
really well and then i'm also going to
twist it around itself and then i'm just
going to pin it in
place and that is he finished third
hairstyles basically just a really
simple in the front with a lot of twists
and turns in the back it doesn't take
very much time just a lot of twisting
but can get a little tedious but it's
not hard very simple very cute and very
fun and flirty and sassy and all the
things you need in a hairstyle for
summer right ok so the next one is super
simple and really cute I do this pretty
often all right now what I'm gonna do is
take my hair and put it into two
sections and I'm going to take my
headband and put it across my forehead
and I just gonna take your hair and
you're going to braid it on both sides
you could braid it good fishtail braid
you can also just put it into two
pigtails if you don't want to braid so
yeah this is pretty much the finished
hairstyle i think it is super cute for
music festivals concerts just for fun
barbecues hanging out with your friend i
think this is just super fun for the
very last hair so i'm going to take a
big section on the top of my head and
i'm going to put it into a very loose
messy braid I'm going to bring all of my
hair into a low ponytail and now after
half my hair just ponytail Goku separate
above where my ponytail is like make a
hole and I'm going to take the entire
ponytail and slip it under like this so
now my entire phone talisman flips last
but not least I'm going to take all of
this hair bring it back up and I'm going
to pin it into a bun so this is the
fifth and final hairstyle starts with a
really cute braids on top it is a really
cute low bun but this bun is done a
little bit differently so it kind of
looks more like classier and put
together this isn't like your typical
messy bun so this is perfect for days
this is perfect you know for any kind of
summer fun festival kind of thing hope
