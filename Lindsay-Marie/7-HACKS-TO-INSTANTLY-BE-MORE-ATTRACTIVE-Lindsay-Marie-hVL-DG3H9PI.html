or welcome if you happen to be new
today's video is gonna be all about how
to be and feel more attractive Before we
jump into any beauty secrets I'm first
gonna start off with number one which is
actually gonna be to find your
confidence confidence is a key to
feeling and looking attractive if you
don't feel good about yourself then then
you're done for
like you've got to feel good about
yourself because no one is more
important than yourself when it comes to
how you feel about yourself part two of
that is going to be if you don't have
confidence and you feel like you can't
be confident
then don't self-sabotage yourself and
find out why if you're one of those
people that leaves a comment like oh I
just can't do that I can't be confident
that's coming from a place of fear find
out why do you feel that way about
yourself did someone tell you something
in your past has someone hurt you before
because you have to get rid of those
things that make you feel like you
aren't good enough because you are good
enough you are worthy you are perfect
just how you are and you are beautiful
and you are attractive I can make a
whole video about that topic if you'd
like but that is the gist of it next is
finding an easy go-to hairstyle that you
know you can do at any moment or any
times for some people that may be a cute
soft bun or a ponytail my favorite is
actually using my sleep stylers because
I can sleep with them in almost every
single night take them out in the
morning it's heat free pull them out and
my hair is perfectly curled and ready to
go
number three leads into the confidence
thing and that is a power posing I think
power posing is a huge way to build your
confidence it is proven that if you are
a stand in a power pose versus a
reserved closing pose you're gonna feel
more open confident and ready to take on
the day
next is wearing what makes you feel good
and not what anyone else tells you to
wear and the truth is everyone knows
what makes them feel good you know
you've put on an outfit before maybe
because someone else told you to put it
on and you look in the mirror and you
just don't feel great about it
my outfit is my favorite part of the day
when I'm going out somewhere so I always
make sure to wear what I want to wear
not because some trend is telling me to
wear it not because my best friends
not because the girl in the magazine is
wearing it because I want to wear it it
is perfectly okay for everyone to have
different styles and different tastes so
rock your unique style and notice how
much more attractive you will look and
feel excellent is if you're going to
wear a makeup know how to put it on I
feel like if you look at some of my
videos just a year or two ago I still
look at that and I cringe a little bit
and now because I'm ugly because no one
is ugly but because I looked better
without makeup in those videos because I
simply didn't know how to put makeup on
my foundation was always like creased
down here I always were way too much
blush I had mascara all over my eyelid
my eyebrows I don't know what I was
doing I didn't simply I just simply
didn't know what I was doing so I
realized it was better until I learned
or practiced on what to do to just wear
less makeup because I look fine just
being a my natural beautiful self never
apologize for your natural you natural
your natural face so what I would
recommend is maybe practice your makeup
at home if you know you want to wear it
next is smiling and be kind another one
of those interview T things but they're
true
everyone loves someone that looks happy
and friendly and is nice to them I know
people like to joke about the resting
b-word face and that's fine but I
personally if I'm in a room and I want
to talk to someone or meet someone I'm
gonna go up to someone who's smiling
versus someone that is a little bit more
intimidating number six is a hygiene
nothing is more attractive than personal
hygiene need to hear before you leave
you're brushing your teeth putting on
deodorant adding some perfume if you
want and last but not least is taking
care of those inside as well drink your
water eat your fruits and veggies
because that is going to lead to clearer
skin healthier hair healthier nails a
healthier you and that is a very very
important step alright guys I hope you
