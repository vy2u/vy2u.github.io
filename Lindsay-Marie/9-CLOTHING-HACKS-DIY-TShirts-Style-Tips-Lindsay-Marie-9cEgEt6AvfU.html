or welcome if you are new today's video
is going to be a t-shirt fashion hacks
going to be two different types of hacks
you will have your DIY fashion hacks on
how to like DIY and your t-shirts to
look a little bit newer and cuter and
more trendy they also have some styling
tips on how to style plain old t-shirts
to make them look even cuter now
hopefully after this video you will
never see a plain old t-shirt the same
again because I think they are in
central part of any wardrobe I hope you
guys enjoyed this video please give it a
thumbs up if you liked it and let's go
ahead and get started first I will be
acid washing this t-shirt now make sure
to wear gloves and to use a cotton
t-shirt I just sprinkled the bleach all
over my shirt straight out of the bottle
you can also use a spray bottle if you
have one please notice the bleach
spreads a lot like it will literally
double whatever you put on this shirt so
expect a double acid wash with however
much bleach you use so if you do want a
lesser effect you can add very tiny
sprinkles and you can also dilute the
bleach with water if for less harsh
spots but I wanted a pretty drastic
effect so I did a lot of bleach and I
did it straight with no water after this
you're gonna sat out and dried it for
about five to ten minutes you just want
to rinse it thoroughly until all of the
bleach is out and I mean like super
super and says because you don't want to
irritate your skin
and then after you have rinsed your
shirt out just let it dry you can do
this overnight or also in your dryer and
then you're left with a really really
cool acid wash t-shirt now you can do
this to any old t-shirt it's specially
perfect for shirts you really love that
maybe have old stains on them to make
them new and hack number two is an easy
way to style any t-shirt just tuck it
into a cute pair of jeans like I did
here maybe add on a belt and some
accessories and maybe some cool shoes
and then you have a really stylish
outfit now style hack number three is to
pair your t-shirts with a cute jacket I
don't know why but a jacket on top of
any t-shirt like instantly makes it
super cute super trendy and put together
the next DIY hack is to turn an old
baggy t-shirt into a very very cute crop
top make sure the measure against your
body to find out exactly
how long you want your t-shirt to be and
then just simply cut off the excess this
actually worked perfect for me to get
rid of this old pizza stain and I could
still use this t-shirt and I love the
way this turned out
now another style hack is actually when
you have a t-shirt like this with baggy
sleeves just simply roll them up for a
cute cold shoulder t-shirt take any
t-shirt I chose this one because there's
an older one that I've had from
Hollister but it has a cutest design on
it and it says all equal and I didn't
want to get rid of this shirt so what I
decided to do is turn this one into a
cold shoulder tee so all you want to do
is measure how long you want the
shoulder cutouts to be definitely make
sure to mark your link so you don't like
forget them and also measure how deep
you want the cutouts to be as well just
so you make sure that both sides match
because it would be awful if you cut
them out and then then you had different
matching shoulders and they weren't even
so then cut out your shoulders and you
have a really cute cold shoulder top and
my next style hack is the pair of loose
t-shirts with tight pants like I did
here you compare them with skinny jeans
or leggings for a very cute and comfy
look and then another way to style it
looser t-shirts is just to tie the
bottom of the shirt up like I did here
and that is super trendy as well now
last but not least for a very cute net
cut out attached choker t-shirt you can
totally make one just cut out a triangle
starting from the neckline of your
t-shirt
now I accidentally cut mine inside out
but I got lucky and it still totally
worked this is actually my favorite way
to DIY t-shirts
