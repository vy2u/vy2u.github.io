or welcome if you're new today I am here
with Noah my fiance and we are filming
an update video all about our engagement
our wedding wedding planning honeymoon
hopefully everything you guys are
curious to know about what's going on
now before we get started we do have a
sponsor today from status money and

ton with our wedding so it's dad's money

United States from comparing you can

interest rates from your bank and
compare your net worth your income your
debt your spending you get a free credit
score and the same status money makes
their money from ads you can get it
completely freaked out status Lincoln
will have a link down below to start
making more financially informed money
making decisions today
link down below okay so first up is
engagement I wasn't going to talk about
that at first but I realized there could
be a lot of new people into the channel
who might not know about our engagement
so I thought we would touch base on it
first we got engaged I guess it's been
about a year and a half all people were
curious how long we've been engaged I
guess I answer is a year and a half
Washington Square Park New York I had
the hiccups also I feel like it's fruit
is it rude to say it our photographer
missed the shot oh yeah I didn't want to
say that cuz he's a good friend of ours
and we love him so much so the
engagement photo we have is actually
fake so it's he actually had us like
just like staged another engagement
which I want to say I'm upset about just
cuz it's a mistake and it happens I am a
little sad though because the second
time obviously it wasn't the same
emotion like the first time I was
sobbing I know what my hand was like
loose and in the photo I'm just smiling
and it's a little like staged but that's
okay it was still so beautiful everyone
in the park like turned around and like
cheer
it was so it was about to engagement so
I did which we had like photos of it but
yeah fake ones and that counts on to the
wedding so first where are we getting
married Santorini Greece we're getting
married in Greece Bruges come right back
up we chose a crease everyone's asking
why did we choose Greece and I think a
lot of it was because he is from Ohio
and I am from Georgia and we were trying
to think of a way to bring all of our
family together and we're like well if
we're gonna be in the middle somewhere
why not just meet somewhere nowhere near
the middle and get married increase it's
been really nice so we found a company
that does all-inclusive we just pay them
one lump sum and then they handle
everything the only thing that they're
not taking care of because we wanted our
own it's a photographer and videographer
and that means yes there will be photos
and videos for everyone asking okay so
now on to budget also the noise Israel
he's being wild so he's growling so we
really never had a budget we never got
that far when we looked at venues in
Tennessee they're around like twelve to
fifteen thousand that was it so we just
kind of looked just for fun in Greece
and it turns out for everyone it was
almost half of the cost to have our
wedding there it supposed to Tennessee
and all the questions asking about like
my mom and stuff I will talk more about
my family soon and what am I like new
sit-down talk videos I've been doing but
my mom and I currently or leave a hole
I've haven't ly had the best healthiest
relationship and I worry with the
relationship that we have that bringing
her could be not smart because she's a
bit unpredictable and I would hate for
us to get there and her to get upset
about something or her to cause a scene
I hate to say that but it's just it's
something we would have to think about
and I wanted to still bring my two
brothers however they would have no
supervision I mean I would be there to
watch them but they wouldn't be able to
stay in our hotel room
have their own hotel room and my
brothers are 16 and 14 16 I'm 14 and I
don't really know how smart it is for
two a 16 and 14 year old to one fly
across from one country to a different
country by themselves because we
wouldn't be able to be on the same
flight with it we looked and we tried
getting them on our same flight it
wasn't possible our flights already
booked up they'd have to be on a flight
from Atlanta we're going on a flight
from New York so they'd be flying by
themselves they had they have a layover
in a country that is not mainly
english-speaking and either of them
wouldn't know what to do I just kind of
worried about all the possibilities of
them getting hurt or you know getting
lost or you know trying to be typical
teenagers and sneaking out of the room
in Greece that's why we're not bringing
them it is really sad that I can't me my
brothers I am sad about it but I think
it's gonna be for the best and what will
I do something fun that then like taking
the six flags or something I don't know
well do something to make it up for them
and I am were sad about it but I think
it's the safest decision leads onto
bridesmaid dresses veils shoes and
everyone has been asking about my
finished dress so I did recently go in
get my dress finally tried on my dress
and I do have to get altered
okay so I'm taking bets right off it was
kind enough to give the girls their
bridesmaid dresses which I thought was
so so nice and they also while we were
there they gift me my veil my shoes and
my headband it was a dream come true
picking out my wedding dress it was not
a David's Bridal was not the best
experience I actually went in for my
wedding dress and told her my budget and
the lady knew my budget and she kept I
didn't tell anyone till afterwards I
would be in the dressing room trying on
dresses and I would look at the tag and
they would be like double my budget
sometimes like almost I think there were
two dresses I tried on the entire time
that were in my budget and I thought
maybe my budget was too low but then
when I left and talked about the girls
that came with me they're all like no
that was a pretty normal good price to
budget either when I tried my dress on
it was actually one of them that was in
my price range and it was still like I
felt like a princess so I knew it was my
dress so I'm most I'm so happy with my
dress
I just felt like they weren't the way
they were supposed to be they weren't
super sweet they weren't super nice when
I told the lady like what the dress I
wanted she was like I when I when she
saw her she's like oh that's going here
are you sure you don't wanna try on a
few more I kept doing no this is that
she's like are you sure it was really
awkward like I feel like when you say
okay this is the dress I want like the
lady who was helping you try them on
should it be like discouraging it
supportive yeah and it me feel kind of
like uncomfortable wasn't my choice mine
it was the dress I wanted so anyways the
way the places I got my dress that I'm
not gonna promote them too much because
I didn't feel super comfortable there
I'll be honest I'm not sure if they used
to girls with bigger budgets however
when I went into David's Bridal by the
end of it I wished I got my dress there
I wish I got my dress there lady who I
worked with it was so kind so sweet she
made the whole entire experience like a
dream I felt like Cinderella the girls
felt like Cinderella we all left and we
all kept raving about how wonderful she
was and how she made it the best
experience so I do have some clips
picking out my bail my shoes headpiece
lots of crying and the bridesmaid dress
says and also my final clip of when I
tried on my dress at the other store and
I'm going to include or insert all those
now oh my gosh oh my gosh it's so pretty
I love in the old white too you know
yeah I feel like it already fits really
well yeah oh my gosh I'm so excited

zero regrets right I think at first
there's a lot of times when we were like
wait are we gonna regret not having a
typical wedding are we gonna regret not
having all our friends family and
friends there are we gonna regret not
having that normal day but I think the
more we've talked about it the more we
realized we wouldn't have had that
normal day though I know that a lot of
my family wouldn't be able to come from
Georgia he knows a lot of his family
wouldn't and as much as we want to say
our friends would like weird we just
don't want to spend all that money on
you know and then how people not be able
to show up cuz how far away it is so I
don't know I feel like in the end of you
