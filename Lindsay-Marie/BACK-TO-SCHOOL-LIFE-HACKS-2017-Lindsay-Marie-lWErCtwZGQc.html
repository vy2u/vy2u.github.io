so not cooperating good me too
meh day is today my hair and they must
okay to you now I doesn't laugh it has
been a lion's mess today
it was like so frizzy it was just it was
just bad and I've tried so much and this
is good as I can get my extensions are
really good things very well today I
just I just let's just move on from it
okay today's video is a life hacks for
back-to-school and this is a for girls
edition so I kind of do things that were
for girls like things to do with periods
and things that happen to girls in
school things like dress code all that
good stuff so don't share with you some
of my favorite hack yeah also if you
would like to enter my back-to-school
giveaway make sure to stay tuned to the
very end of this video where I will have
all the details and everything so make
sure to stay to the very end give this
video a thumbs up and let's get started
number one is the key base pair outfit
in case of emergencies what I like to do
is take a t-shirt dress that I know is
cool appropriate even something even
longer than teaches in like typical
school dress code maybe down to your
knees something that you know you will
not get in trouble for something
lightweight that you can hide easily in
a backpack I like to take that take my
teacher dress I like to put some
underwear on top of it and maybe even a
pad just in case and then I like to roll
all of that up and stick it either
underneath the bottom of my backpack or
in my locker I was in high school that
way if something happens say your pants
rip say you start your period so you get
dressed coded you have something back up
so that way you don't have to wear
something the school gives you like
school sweatpants or something you have
something for you to have it's just a
good passive way to keep something just
in case cuz I will tell you I had my
pants rip in school once and I was so
embarrassed but luckily I only had to go
around like five minutes like that
because I
did have a backup dress in my locker
number two is plain your outfits for the
week but actually go ahead and hang them
up together what I like to do is every
Sunday over here maybe I just wear this
always hair in my face in every video Oh
what I like to do is on Sunday
pick five alphas out for the entire week
I like to go ahead and kind of look at
the weather so the one is going to be
like and then what I like to do is hang
up my outfits together so I'll take my
jeans and hang the shirt on the same
hanger that way I just have five outfits
ready in the morning I can just grab it
and go no no reason to stress about an
outfit and it'll end up getting too lazy
if it can help it out and go for what I
have slept in that night and I'm good to
go number three if you're someone who
likes to do your makeup your makeup and
your hair in the morning and you feel
like you spend more time finding your
junk in the morning and actually putting
it on me now what I like to do at night
is lay out exactly what I need so if I'm
going to be doing my eyebrows my mascara
lip gloss and you know curling my hair
that I will have literally those items
right there on the counter in order for
me to grab I don't have to search them
in the morning it has been laid out
saves me so much time number four if you
start your period in class or something
you to be to leave class in general you
don't have an excuse it's also works for
that but I use this excuse or for some
reason I started my period or something
I really needed to go to the bathroom
and I didn't want to say hey I need you
to the bathroom and they you know I
start my period obviously at first I
will just always asking to go to the
restroom and if they say no what I like
to do is state when I did in school was
say my contact fell out because I didn't
wear contacts and even if you don't wear
contact they aren't really going to know
I just say like my contacts fell off and
your not going to want you to sit there
not being able to see so it's pertaining
up something in your hand and run to the
bathroom
and do your stuff come back and all is
well and nobody really knows why you
needed to leave the classroom next is
invest in something to wear under your
crop tops and stuff like that that way
you cannot get direct coated they
actually have these cute little bodysuit
type thing some usher what they're
called in the underwear section of us
every store I found one at forever 21
for six dollars I just got one to match
my skin tone and I swear it underneath
my crop top if they so if you're in
school or something you lift your arms
up they're not actually going to see
your stomach or your skin they're going
to see the body so instead
that way they can't make you change your
shirt if you have prone to forgetting
things I am probably one of those people
make some kind of reminder we could even
make a good cute doormat or maybe a door
sign you could even do like a checklist
everything you need in the morning or
something really cute and simple like
forgetting anything question mark you
will see that every morning it'll make
you stop and think am I forgetting
anything you'll do well to the list
think about what you need and you'll
know whether or not you're good to go
out the door in the morning this could
really save you some trouble and
sometimes in case you forget something
some mornings like keys wallets anything
like that this could really save you if
you're looking for somewhere just to
hide your pads when you're going to
school maybe you are wearing jeans that
day wearing a dress or a skirt well you
can honestly do is just stick it in your
bra to stick it on the side they're not
going to fall out it'll stay pretty
stable that way whenever you go to the
restroom you already have it on hand and
yes and so forth obviously if you're
wearing jeans you can just put it in
your back pocket but I wear a lot of
dresses in skirts and school so that
helped me out all the time honestly if
you're someone who gets grouchy in the
morning when you wake up or just anyone
in general I just recommend to turn it
on some fun music I like turning on like
insync britney spears all the fun pop
songs that you can sign listen to when I
was younger and I will notice I'll if I
get up in a grouchy mood I start playing
the music and halfway in between getting
ready I am jamming out singing dancing
everywhere
