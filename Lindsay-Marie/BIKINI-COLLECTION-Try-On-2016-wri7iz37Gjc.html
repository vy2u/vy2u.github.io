super tan then it has the blue lace band
which I really love we'll have one more
swim suit from to-die-for does these
exact same design as the other ones
except for this one is a floral pattern
so it's really pretty like red and green
floral pattern all over the swimsuit but
with the white lace my next one's to is
from Tilly's I love Tilly's if you
haven't shopped there and you should
shop there it's kind of like pack Sun or
zoomies or something like that I love
the color this is a really pretty maroon
and like deep green or almost like an
olive it's got a cage cutout in the
front at the top then the pattern is
just super intricate next is one of my
absolute favorite swimsuits you might
have seen this on my Instagram before
this one just looks like this it is a
white swimsuit with really pretty like
leafy design on the top I really I love
the swimsuit it's got like a really nice
padding so if you I mean I don't really
keeps you covered if that makes sense as
a swimsuit from triangle I do only have
one of them because these things are
hella expensive I just have these simple
white one if you don't know about
triangle swimsuits is basically a
neoprene a swimsuit so it's kind of like
a wetsuit like I said just have the
white one with the black outline really
hewed really flattering um but these
things are like suction cups and a whoop
girl
well the swimsuit from Victoria's Secret
I've had this one for about a year now
it's really cute with white with a
really bright pink and orange like super
intricate design next I have a swimsuit
from adore me this is actually the first
time I really purchased anything from
them I just wanted a simple colors from
sue and I saw they have this really
pretty like neon yellow one actually
have two swimsuits from Target and if
you have a never bought a some superb
Target you should do so because they are
they're really affordable they're not
super expensive and they're honestly
really good material and really cute the
first one I have is just a simple like
blue and white striped one it's got a
cute bow in the middle it's a push up
one which I like and I also have a dark
navy blue one with a really pretty like
floral design on it I don't actually
know if I have the bottom to this one
anymore I might have lost them when I
moved next I have this really cute
reversible one from Tommy Bahama on one
side is like super like bright pink and
on the outside is white with like a
green and orange e floral pattern and
now we've got my wholesale swimsuits now
if you haven't tried a wholesale
swimsuit what are you doing
I love these um basically wholesale
swimsuits are super cheap like they're
like ridiculously cheap like you're
about to spend like four dollars on this
one to four dollars who remembers that
you're gonna spend like four dollars for
a swim so it's not gonna last you
forever but it's four dollars you'll
last you like half a summer maybe a
whole summer and you're like you know
buddy you rolled like a big shot yeah so
first thing I have is just a really cute
like moon pattern one is a pretty blue
color like a night sky that's got moons
and Suns all over it I have this really
pretty like triangle styled swimsuit
it's also a whole set one it is a super
neon blue with a super neon highlighter
greenish yellow and it's made to be
strapless but it I off it does have like
straps on it as well also have the same
swimsuit and other color and another
light-colored whatever I'm saying this
one is orange and yellow it's a little
bit of pink and the bottoms are again
you know basically the same super thin
trying to like sketch me out swimsuit is
also a wholesale one but it's a little
bit funkier this one is cray cray
it is bright orange with yellow straps
and then pink little arm bands and it's
yellow striped it like goes down your
stomach you know creates a really
awesome tan line I'm kidding that
sarcasm warning yet but I'm going to I
promise I hope we'll see like again it
was like 4 bucks so if I don't wear it
it's okay
all right and actually I forgot once so
actually last but not least it's just
super cute bright pink one that I got
from forever 21 it's almost like a
salmon pink it looks a lot brighter on
camera but it's like an orange II salmon
eat pink but I like it's like a peachy
pink it's not really pretty floral
design it's almost like a watercolor
design it is strapless but it's got like
pretty good like wiring so it's not one
