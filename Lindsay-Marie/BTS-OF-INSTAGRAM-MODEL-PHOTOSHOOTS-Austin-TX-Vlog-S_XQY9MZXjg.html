reason I got it you so nice I'm like
Nicole this whole video it probably
seems like it's just nothing about
taking photos I want you guys to realize
when we go on trips we don't take photos
the entire time it's probably like maybe
a fourth of the day it's just like for
this video I wonder really show you guys
what it's like when you go on like an
influence or trip and how much work and
time really goes in the photos that way
you guys realize like we spend so much
time taking these photos but it's worth
it because I love doing this I'm so
grateful my job basically you guys I'm
grateful that I get to do things like
this because a snob you'll go forward to
do anything and like even sitting up on
this rooftop it's like what three years
ago I was living oh maybe four or five
years goes living in a trailer with a
bunch of roommates broke eating oatmeal
for half my meals and that's like only
goes up from here guys so wherever
you're at right now no
