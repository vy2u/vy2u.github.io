you happen to be new today's video is
going to be a haul I haven't done a
whole and like way too long and I used
to do them like once or twice a month so
I'm back with another haul and this haul
is actually with the boo boo so I'm so
excited because I love all their stuff
so so excited to get to partner with
them on this video boo who has so much
fun affordable on trend fashion with
thousands thousands of new items
dropping in every single week with the
majority of their items being under $100
and tons of things even more affordable
than that I will have all items in my
description and thanks again to boo hoo
for sponsoring this video
okay so we have outfit number one a
little bit love it because I love
casualness and coziness and
comfortability and this is all of that
and it's really cute so I'm gonna start
off with these Alicia med right skinny
jeans I don't really have any plain
jeans so I really really wanted a pair I
love the wash of these these are so
comfortable very stretchy so good I
paired them with this really cute this
is the Holly Rose jumper ugly softe
sweater I don't think I've ever put on
way softer than anything I don't like oh
my gosh so soft and then last but not
least I paired with these really cute
suede black ballet flats then this whole
outfit is super cash super comfy so for
the second out of it I picked out this
black studded shirt dress um love this
go is all the time I'm not usually a fan
of dresses because I always feel like
too girly which doesn't usually feel
like myself but these this feels good it
feels like edgy and cool and fun and me
and it's so really comfortable and then
I paired the dress with these really
cute leopard booties which I thought
would make it just a little fun I always
want to know how to pair like fun shoes
with shirt so I'm just like looking
online and on their Instagram I was like
I got this outfit number three I
actually didn't even pick this out so
they told me to pick up my outfit and
then I
bag and there was an extra outfit in
there I was like thank you I said this
is just these it's a sand colored cords
at because like a sport colored set all
that getting down below don't worry in
case I'm like saying it rock I love
these I love the color I love the
stripes down the said oh my gosh this is
very comfortable very soft I love that
this is just a little crop so I feel
like it add just a little bit more like
hmm - it is that the right word Kona
that's what I chose this velvet I think
it's like the crushed velvet banty
t-shirt dress that's a mouthful but it's
cute super cute I always order my
t-shirt dresses in a size smaller than I
am which sometimes can be a little risky
because sometimes you risk them in like
too short and then the movie sticking
out but I got really lucky and this one
is really nice okay good links for a
t-shirt drastic and then I paired it
with this for striped oversized denim
jacket I'm probably mixing up the name
but I've always wanted to go really cute
and really cozy denim jacket especially
an oversize I only have like some like
typical form fitting on so I love this
is oversized I can throw it on for the
pretty much anything up but anyways for
the South I also apparent with he's
black with black thigh-high movies as
well okay so on to outfit number five I
started out with this really fun
embroidered mini skirt I kind of chose
this outfit because of the skirt so I
paired the skirt with this really fun a
slash neck jumper or sweater and a
mustard color which I thought really
accented well with the pops of yellow
the art on the skirt as well
I definitely love this combo and then I
heard
but with these really cute flat studded
ankle boots I don't have any flat like
combat style boots and you guys know I
love my cabled off Morgan so I was like
I need these shoes okay guys so second
to lifestyle but I feel like this is
giving me like major vampy vibes not mad
about it because the pants these are
like a liking of tight material and
they're a very colored like tight fitted
pant I love these I love that having
them paired with this top so this is a
maxi shirt on the definitely love the
whole vibe of this and I just heard it
again with those same ballet flats
though good notes I know what she's know
where it's at but definitely noticing
you wearing this on the gram all right
so last outfit we are going out with a
bang definitely obsessed with this one
so I picked out these low these are the
low-rise distress the boyfriend jeans I
love these because they are super
distracting or even distressed in the
back I've never had any jeans are like
that in the back so I really like them
and I just tucked in and played my tank
top I already had and then paired it
with this Korean that I also got from
boohoo and this is called the boyfriend
cardigan it's just so cozy and then last
at least I just added this really cute
black floppy hat I love well this pair
together in again I just added the black
slip on a ballet slippers which show you
how versatile and like necessary these
kind of shoes are because you can
literally throw them on with anything
alrighty so that is it for my haul
hopefully you liked it again thank you
