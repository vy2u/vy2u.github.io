or welcome if you're new my name is
Lindsay marine today's video is my
colored Bible misguided hull I am so not
gonna lie I had like a killer migraine
right now but I don't even care I was
like I just want to film this I'm so
excited to film it I'm just gonna push
through and pretend I don't feel it we
didn't know I'm a pretty big Carly fan
she found Carly's channel a few years
ago I was like 17 and I was looking for
videos on how to curl my hair with a
straightener and we're watching that
video and like pretty much burning my
hair off because I couldn't figure out
how to do it I was not very talented
with my straightener like she was
I also remember this is like I'm like
hardcore feigning I'm like a weirdo on
Instagram can post something like for
like the first 10 people that repost her
Instagram post she would follow them on
Instagram and I was like oh girl and
I've never posted something so fast my
fingers have never moved so quickly you
don't even understand
so I was one of the ten and then she
followed me and I like flipped out and
then ever the first time she liked all
my photos I think it was like I was
heating cookies or something I was like
I called my mom was like mom calling
virus-like my photo media cookie and she
was like Lindsey chill out and I was
like you don't understand okay
Queen because one of those youtubers
when you can really tell you can
seriously tell how genuine and humble
and kind she is um which I love and
she's perfect virtually everything I got
oh my god okay so first I got this baby
pink eyelet bodycon dress it is faux
suede it is beautiful it is so soft with
the material is literally a softest
thing ever
and the color is perfect I love that she
looked like the pastel colors because I
love pastel it has like the really
pretty like lace top design over here
and like buttons down the middle this is
literally stunning nicely is the rose
gold bomber and you know you were
excited about this we were all excited
about this this is literally so
beautiful um it's the prettiest rose
gold color I've ever seen in my life
it's not like I've got a little bit of
like the darker rose gold side but I
think it's so pretty it's like a tan
rose gold it's got the lace up detail on
the side as well I love this she has
kind of like themes going on here
next is the crochet lace bra lad this is
so produces my favorite things it's like
a baby blue like
with like a light grayish white I don't
know how to explain the color this would
be so pretty with like some black pans
with some jeans with the skirt
I think the lace detail is stunning I
love how it's like seats a little bit
like more see-through at the bottom so
it gives a little bit more of like a
sexy appeal so this is the mint green
like ribbed bodycon dress it is so
beautiful I love the material it's a
little stretchy ER so that's perfect you
can get like a smaller size if you want
a little bit tighter you can wear a
little bit looser it's kind of up to you
these can be so casual you know just
with like a pair of sneakers like some
converse or some sandals but you can
also wear some heels with this and like
some jewelry make this really dressed up
next is the rose gold
I'm silky like cami dress I love this it
is so flattering I think it's gonna be
so flattering for like everyone I love
material it is really soft it's really
like a sexy soft material really go good
with like some high boots some heels
like again you can wear with some
sandals if you wanted this will be
something that I'll probably run like a
night out but I love it I also got the
lace long-sleeve cropped up I've seen so
many people post pictures wearing this
already and I was like whoa that is so
beautiful on me it's beautiful in person
like right here too
but on I've seen people wearing it I'm
like oh like sure so much detail to this
I love like the cutout lace sleeves you
know that you can actually see your arm
through then you also have like you know
the lace detail on the shoulders you
have like like the pattern is so pretty
it's very flattering
it's a little stretchy or so it's gonna
be like tight-fitting but it's not gonna
like like it's not gonna be painful it's
gonna be comfy to wear stuff I also got
the Jersey crop top and like the blight
blue gray color and to go along with it
I did get the pants as well
these are super comfy these are gonna
make them look really comfy like legging
workout pants I can tell I also would
probably wear these liked on lunch dates
I love the material super stretchy but
also very form-fitting this is the
embroidered plunge crop top this is in
the nude color oh my gosh it is a lower
neckline which I like you could
obviously if you're not comfortable that
you can wear like a bra let under you
can just wear some pasties so that is
everything I got from the Carli bybel
misguided collection I am so pleased I
am so happy this collection this is
stuff that you do not find other stores
this is definitely unique
pretty but also so classy stunning
pieces I'd say like a to thumbs up A+
job to Carly misguided this is look
really probably these are not probably
these are definitely like my new
favorite items I'm going to be adding
into my closet and I was excited for
myself to be at be able to buy all this
out I mean to have like YouTube is like
my job but you know it's like my new job
you know like 200,000 subscribers is
like enough to live off of but it's not
like I'm like making crazy money I
struggle sometimes but I was so excited
because these pieces were affordable so
I was able to get a good bit which made
me really happy like I don't know just
so yeah it also kind of showed me how
far I've come because when I was first
watching Carly Sheena I didn't have a
channel yet and I think watching
youtubers like that really inspired me
you know to be able to get out of like
you a lot of you guys know about my
childhood in my past think it really
inspired me to get out of the rut that I
was in and do something different with
my life and like Here I am like in a
know a new state in a new city like you
know like I don't know I'm still really
excited I know my channels gonna keep
growing which gives me a lot of hope so
I really love Carly I think she's so
inspirational and she's definitely been
an inch but like a big inspiration to me
