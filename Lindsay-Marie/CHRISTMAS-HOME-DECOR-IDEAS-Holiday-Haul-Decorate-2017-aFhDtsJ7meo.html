more videos like mine alright so first
bag all we have were some pillows and
yes wow they guess there are some pretty
big pillows so first I got these two
fluffy white pillows these were 20 bucks
for these two I feel like these would
look so good on the couch and they're so
soft and then and the mixed bag right
here
so where I will be recycling all of
these bags and don't you worry in this
value right here I got another set of
these same pillows when I was like 4
pillows that just seems like a good
number two couches four pillows and if I
don't need all four I'll put him on my
bed and then if I'm the same like throw
collection I found this the Rose studio
blanket actually my mama found it she
was here for the weekend this is a throw
studio and decorative throw blanket I
thought it was a robbery at first I
thought this was a really cute white
fluffy rug but I found out it is a
blanket bag number three in bag number
three we have yeah what do we have here
the first thing we have are my stocking
oh oh then I'm going for like a white
green and rose gold theme this year just
because no justice I'm Bo for it so I
have these cute little reindeer stocking
holders I wanted to do three stocking
holders one for me one for Noah one for
a rooster our doggy they were they were
only $12.99 but so I don't want to spend
another $12.99 and not good to use all
of them so I only got one set and then
maybe you will find like I was thinking
maybe I could look for like a mini
reindeer or something to hold roosters
I'd be so cute
and in this same bag right here I have
two stockings these are super cute faux
fur stockings and these are huge I don't
know what size it's talking supposed to
be huge or the normal size I don't know
I'm so excited for them I also really
wanted to get one of those like really
cute like faux fur like white looking
rugs kind of something like this and
they did have some but des was expensive
there were like 60 bucks I was like and
they were really little too so this one
was this one was $20 so 20 bucks for a
cute fluffy white rug and then I also
got these super cute string lights oh my
gosh I kind of wish I'd gotten two of
these but I didn't need to
maybe fine I'll just use one if I decide
I need another one then I'll get another
one I
like by 2 and then have to return them
because I never return things and I wish
I did and then I'm just sad I'm scared
anyway so these are the Lucent star

living room either these are also for
the bedroom but it had to show you these
guys they're so freaking cute my first
thing unboxing out of this bag it's this
huge rose gold enormous that cover
either gold on almost honestly it's like
gold a candle a tree stump looking thing

this was a twenty bucks now I'm not
gonna lie I was like I don't know if I
want to spend twenty bucks on this but
I'm glad I did because I like it they
hadn't had three different sizes and I
wanted to get one of each size like to
do like a cute little triangle with them
