video just saw something I really wanted
to make a video on and just before I get
started let's just say my channel is
about positivity and positiveness no
negativity so please watch this with an
open mind
I'm not putting anyone down I'm not
putting down any person that likes to
use waste centures or corsets for like
wastin Chi I am NOT putting you down I
am just going to simply give you my
insight and my reasons for those out
there who were thinking about it and
maybe are leaning towards getting one so
maybe I can try and persuade you to
doing something a little bit better for
your life now this is my channel and I
have a voice and I have a right to have
a voice so if you don't want to see here
reasons on why you should why I don't
think you should waste training you
don't have to watch this I'm not gonna
put you down I'm never gonna come watch
a waste training video and be mean to
them so please don't feel the need to
come over here and be upset
so watch this with an open mind if
you're gonna watch it's not healthy for
you
doctors have proven that is not good for
you I mean nothing about waste training
is actually good for you like some
people can say that it's not bad for you
there's a lot of people don't make
videos think it's not bad for you but
they can't think of one reason that it's
good for you you have organs inside your
you have organs you have ribs you have
so much inside of you that have to have
somewhere to go now it's different when
you could gradually lose weight and your
body is doing it as a whole but when
you're putting something on yourself and
modifying and forcing your body to
become a different shape it is forcing
those things inside of your body to move
around and move somewhere else where
it's not specifically supposed to be
thing is that honestly I think is it
some people think it's almost like a
cop-out to lose weight and that's not a
good thing like if if you want to lose
weight that's a great and that's great
you know that's a good goal if you want
to if you want to get healthy that's
great but waste training isn't getting
healthy weight training is just getting
a different body
Society has kind of brainwashed people
to think that you have to have a certain
body shape or a certain body type and
you do not like your body shape your
body type is beautiful however it is
like you are meant to have the body type
the body shapes that you already have
like don't try and force your body it
looks like something else like if you
want to be healthier doctor bring more
power to you I love that but don't try
and make yourself think that you have to
be a certain size to be like you know
that's so up your body is worth more
you're a beautiful
your body's worth more than forcing it
to look like something else like I don't
have any kind of curve in my waist I was
not born with like a curvy waist I'm
very flat and that's okay with me my
goal and your goal should not be to have
a certain waist size it should be to be
healthy strong powerful and confident
don't think about trying to look like so
and so whoever you're looking at think
about you know feeling good looking good
and just doing good for your body so you
can go to the gym and eat healthy and
you're gonna get better results that are
going to last feel good and make your
your body is going to love you for it so
I'm not saying this is in any sort of
bad way I just really want to give you
some insight like you have a beautiful
body whoever you are whoever you are
watching this you have a beautiful body
and you maybe you should repeat that
right now
next realize your mind deserves the best
because it's the only body you're ever
going to have so instead of thinking let
me go by this waist trainer wear and
hurt myself for a few hours every single
day how about I go to the gym do
something good for my body the goal is
to be powerful strong and confident and
that isn't a waist trainer is not gonna
do that a healthy healthy living a
healthy lifestyle that is going to do
that so I love you guys so much and
again if you like if your waist training
are you doing this I'm not putting you
down I'm not telling you not to do it
I'm not ever gonna do that okay I'm
never gonna come and be negative to
someone so please don't come on here and
be negative my channel is all about
positivity and I love you guys I love
you guys so much I hope you enjoyed this

is my first time ever really making a
video like this I'm kind of nervous I
love you guys please take it in the way

positive way I don't mean it any sort of
negative way so hope you understand that
