today i am filming a video with short
hair kind of weird um it's just an intro
calm down but i know i'm already
thinking like where's Lindsay and what
did you do with her um I don't know why
I everyone has self-conscious issues and
my self-confidence definitely has to do
with my hair I've always had really thin
here um but I mean it's all rounds born
with so maybe I need to embrace it a
little I don't know let me know in the
comments honest opinion short hair or
long hair it's not gonna hurt my
feelings as long as you're nice about it
don't be like girl I hate your no no no
no but tell me though honest opinion
long hair short hair because I can do
either one or should i do both sometimes
and mix it up that's a cool thing I
could just mix it up sometimes honest
opinion short hair long hair or mix it
up with both let me know down below so
today I'm doing a DIY summer room
makeover now this is going to include a
few DIYs and is also going to include
some decorations and then it's also
going to include um like stuff that I
did in a previous DIY as well I do use
this pillow in the video like to
decorate my room but I made that in a
previous video so if you want to see how
to make that pillow I will link that
down below so without further ado let's
go ahead and get into the video well its
first year and why I just took a really
cute wooden letter for Lindsay obviously
and then I took to some fake flowers you
can get these at the dollar tree for
like super cheap I took the back off of
the flowers and then I use some tacky
glue that I found like ninety-seven
cents and Michael Zionist super glued
all the flowers onto the wooden initial
in that is it for
DIY for a second thing for my dear I
room makeover I just want to make a
little bit of a summer like a room
inspiration board so i took got pictures
of people working out cute outfit
pictures of the beach pictures of people
traveling cute quotes he thinks it
reminded me of summer and I just pasted
it all down onto a board I also added a
few more fake flowers some paint
whatever I wanted and then I just hung
it up in my room and pretty good it
works for me
laughs I just took these wooden birds I
had I colored them a little bit brighter
um you can get so easy for things like
this at Michael's you can get birds
flowers whatever you want next time I
probably would use not the orange I
might use blue instead next time but
that's okay it turned out pretty cute
Indy and I just decided to hang the
birds on my wall i also had string
lights all over on my room i also got
some really cute flowers I got Michael
whole foods did I added some really
pretty bright colored candles around my
room because I make him smell good in
summary and I also hung up my canvas on
my wall and laughs I just added my DIY
watercolor pillow that I did make in a
previous video but then i will link down
below go check it out that pillow is so
easy to make hope you guys enjoyed this
