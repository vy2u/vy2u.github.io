I'm doing a DIY room decor video and I
haven't done very many of these but I
have to say this one takes the cake I
had so much fun creating this so I
really hope you guys enjoy it I think I
want to start doing more DIY videos so
make sure you give this video a thumbs
up if you want to see more of them and
also let me know in the comments what
kind of DIY videos you would like me to
make next because I think I'm gonna
start making a lot of them because it
was fun so subscribe to my channel if
you have not already I have some of the
best videos I've ever filmed coming up
in the next two weeks so you don't want
to miss them again without further ado
let's get started with the video for the
first DIY Starbucks la lamp you just
want to put about 2/3 of your Starbucks
cup with vegetable oil and then the
separate cup you want to put some food
coloring into your water and then you
want to pour the food colored water into
your vegetable oil and then of course I
made a mess when do I not make a mess
then you want to just put your lid back
on and then put one alka-seltzer plus
into the Starbucks container and wash
your lava Liam come to life
this next DIY is a little bit of
organization and decoration I just took
a spare jar that I had this was an
honesty honest lemonade container and
painting the top half pink and the
bottom mint green I'm on an only gonna
do one really light paint job because I
want it to be sort of vintage looking
sort of rustic now once all my paint has
dried I am putting on some like sticker
letters that say keep the change because
I am going to use this to store it my
change and next I'm just going to add my
spare change and then just so it doesn't
look like just a jar thing on my desk
I'm also going to add some fake flowers
so there you can saw your change and
also have some cute room decor this last
one is a DIY watercolor pillow you just
want to start with a white pillowcase of
some sort and you want to take some
Sharpie markers literally just Sharpie
markers and you just want to color all
over your pillow and different designs
or whatever kind of pattern you want
alright so I just took my sharpie and
just kind of went crazy and just colored
all over the place then after that you
just want to a spray your pillow with
rubbing alcohol until it is fully
saturated and once you fully saturate it
you just want to let it sit for like
five to six hours after that you want to
put it in the dryer for at least twenty
to thirty minutes and then you have a
really cute watercolor pillow super easy
inexpensive and a nice little touch of
color to your room</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
