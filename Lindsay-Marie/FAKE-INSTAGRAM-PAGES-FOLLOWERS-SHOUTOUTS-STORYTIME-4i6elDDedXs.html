look all right so a little dark I hope
not
huh huh huh huh hello there and welcome
back or welcome to here I knew my name
is Lindsay Marie if you didn't know
already in today's video is very
interesting something that I'm excited
to talk to you guys about and that is
all about Instagram shoutout pages I
guess okay so I've found all of these
inspiration accounts there are hundreds
maybe thousands of them I'm sure you've
seen them very popular ones like
American American style kiss and fashion
fashion goals back in these all these
different for inspiration accounts and I
actually usually tag them in all my
photos and hopes for them to repost me
but I have some research so they have my
best friend she came and visited from
Ohio and we are talking about these
accounts and all of information and we
talked about how they post all these
photos and if one account post the photo
usually all of them post the photo and
typically they do not credit whoever's
photo it is typically they will just
credit another inspiration page almost
like they like each inspiration page
will post a photo and be like via act
another inspiration page and it's just
kind of like a loop and within
occasionally they will post photos of
specific girls and they will tag a tag
name but it's always the same girls that
they tagged which we'll get more into
that which I thought was very
interesting so I did notice that a lot
of them have emails saying reach out to
us if you'd like a shout out or a
promotion so I decided let's try this
for a video every steps about 10
fashions inch for inspiration accounts
and all of them got back to me and all
of them told me like they were you know
they had to check my Instagram make sure
my photos were good enough for their
inspiration account what I thought was
interesting and they also they were and
they told me if I wanted to I could pay
them via certain via PayPal and and they
all gave me prices now here's where it
gets very interesting because all king
of them all ten of them gave me the
exact same paypal email address which
makes me realize that I think a lot of
these fashion inspiration accounts are
owned by one person or maybe just a few
people and then
so I asked each one of them how much and
all them gave me different prices pretty
crazy because one of them which has 8
million followers quoted me $800 for one
Instagram post shoutout on their page
and I was like girl uh no but one of
them told me that it would be $40 that
was a cheapest one and they still had
this a million followers so I responded
and said what about $20 and they did not
even argue with me they said ok you can
pay for it today will do it so I pasted
it in the PayPal account knowing that
all of them are run by the same LAN
which was so weird to me I paid them and
then they posted my photo now here's
where it gets interesting I paid them I
was waiting I was like oh my gosh I'm
going to gain like what if it's not
you're not paying for followers you're
paying for an account that has millions
of followers already to shout you out to
publish your photo and say hey go follow
so-and-so so I posted my photo and
they're like hey go fallout Lindex I can
read we love her photos I was like put
my phone down I were thinking oh my gosh
I'm going to gain like so many followers
I was like I might even gain like a
hundred thousand because they had 1
million followers and let's think about
that if one percent of their followers
followed me I would have been gaining a
ton of people and I even looked at their
photos and typically their photos get
got like 200 to 300 thousand thousand
likes
I'm like okay I better at least gain
like 10 to 30,000 you know barely anyone
followed me from it um that beats 1
percent of their life follow me I'd get
that money
well time went on and about the full day
later I check to see how many I gained I
gained 9 followers only so on an account
that has over a million followers it
gets 300,000 likes I gained at 9
followers it sounds like that's really
interesting and I was very disappointed
obviously but I mean I was like paying
for this for the video so I looked at
their photo I looked at my flow
installed my photos only got 2,000 likes
2,000 likes and the rest of their photo
my photos on my Instagram account get
more than 2,000 likes and I have 40,000
followers so I looked in my photo that
you don't like so the rest of their get
to hundreds of thousands so I'm like
something is wrong with
I started scrolling through their pages
the scroll is that same Instagram X
going through their photos and notice
they had done shoutouts before and all
of the girls that they've done shadows
for didn't get more than two thousand
likes and I'm like wait a minute so I
started looking who was liking my photos
and the people that were liking my
photos I think they were some of them
looks like real accounts but a lot of
them look like fake accounts but there
were some real ones so it shows and I
mean I follow them so it shows that some
people do follow these accounts but I
don't think as many as we think follow
them so I started looking through who
was like who liked my photo on their
page is all fake accounts and then a few
that looked real it looks like normal
people
it looks like the ones that looked like
real ones were the ones that followed me
so I started looking at your other
photos the ones that 200,000 likes
scrolling through the people who would
like to those and everyone who is liking
those photos were other inspiration
accounts so it looks like what happens
is they post a photo all of the other
inspiration accounts like their photo
and they just keep liking each other's
photos if that makes you understand what
I'm saying now the weird thing is there
are a few girls that you post and they
do tagged those girls and those girls
get hundreds of thousands of likes and
those girls typically have like like a
million Instagram followers or sometimes
they have like 500k and so I looked at
those girls who get posted a lot and
tagged them in their photos and most of
their followers are also these
inspiration accounts so I'm sorry to
think there must be some sort of network
that you can like sign up when you mom
you must like be in it together
like there must be some girls the ones
we get shout out a lot that work
together to make some kind of like
Instagram accounts that are they all
follow each other and they also probably
paid for tons of fake accounts tons of
fake likes and they use it to grow their
own followings with fake with fake
accounts basically but they do that
because they're also making money off of
it I mean if they're charging 8 some
people $800 for a shout-out
they're making a lot of money so I just
feel like this is so interesting knowing
that every I thought a lot of people
follow these inspiration cows I don't
know
you but just knowing that it doesn't
seem like a lot of it is real like
there's no way there's just no way so
let me know in the comments first off
have you ever looked at these accounts
you know what I were talking about have
you ever been reposted by one what do
you think I've definitely never ever
ever paying through one of their
shoutouts again knowing that is clearly
not not real and not beneficial so if
you ever thought about paying these
accounts I know a lot of people do pay
him for shoutouts you've never thought
about it I do not recommend it because I
do not think it's legit I think there's
something going on in some way that you
forget your must-haves to get in with
him to do this you know does that mean I
don't want how to explain it it's so
weird
now I decide to reach out to another
account as well a parent means are so
accurate set apart from the inspiration
accounts I also noticed there are some
motivation types inspiration accounts
for example you've probably heard of the
good quote there's lots of them like
that it is post like cute clothes and
like cute inspiration stuff his
motivational type stuff and I notice one
event I posted a friend of mine they
just like a cute quote over her photo
and I saw they had something something
that said please reach out to me if
you'd like a shout out so I reached out
and the guy told me the shadows were
thousand dollars and I said okay sorry
never mind but he responded responded
and said I actually have a proposal for
you would you be willing to meet me for
brunch now course I was like no this is
a bad idea
but I was like well if I take Noah with
me then it might not be a big deal
because Noah can obviously protect me
and we can figure out what it what this
is so I told him I was a little worried
about meeting him for Brian Jimmy is
just some guy that owns an Instagram
account it's like three million
followers which is a lot followers but I
was like you know for know this person
could be so we met him at a public
brunch place with him and he brought a
few friends now here's where it gets
very interesting so this guy was driving
a Rolls Royce
he had a Rolex watch on a Louboutin
wallet and a very nice jacket a camera
of what his jacket was a note was super
name-brand let's just say this guy had a
lot of money so we need him for brunch
and he basically explains to me I can't
believe their figures of stuff out so
crazy he basically explained to me that
him as himself and his two friends were
with him own 300 Instagram accounts that
all have
500,000 to 4 million followers and I'm
like 300 Instagram accounts which first
off just proved my theory that these
inspiration accounts are like a network
of one person or a few people he
explained to me that they run all of
these accounts he didn't tell me that
they were fake followers anything but
I'm pretty sure they have to all be at
least some of them have to have fake
followers it's obviously snaps had at
least half their followers fake let me
explain to me that he's looking for more
people to promote his Instagram accounts
because he wants to get more people to
pay him and I was just kind of all I was
just kind of pretending that I was
interested but I knew that I wasn't
really I just want to talk to him and
Moton know more about this and I did
find out that running these Instagram
accounts is his full-time job full-time
job which is insane and he told me he
shot me out onto one of his pages if I
promoted him in a YouTube video and but
I left and I like but when I left I did
politely decline because I went through
his pages and just like the other
fashion inspiration one I know as all of
his photos has like 200,000 likes but if
you clicked on the likes and looked at
the comments it was nothing but other
inspiration accounts like they were
looking like normal people if there
weren't some normal people but not as
enough and then I actually reached out
for my friend who had been shouted out
by them she actually paid them which I'm
like oh I feel so bad that she paid them
and she did tell me that her photo that
she paid for a thousand dollars to be on
their account that it got that she
thinks that she gained about 15
followers from it and all of it was like
weird growth men leaving her nasty
comments so she ended up having to block
all of them so she didn't end up gaining
anything from it I'm not gonna saying
her name because you would know her
she's actually another youtuber but I
just sucked because she paid $1,000 for
a shout-out and it was fake today so my
conclusion is all of these Instagram
accounts are people they repost all
these photos and repost the same photos
and shout out the same girls or rather
by the same people they are making a lot
of money off of this by the shot from
the shoutout
I think most of the followers are their
own sake in our own Instagram accounts
that they run I'm not sure how they run
so many Instagram accounts though there
must be something they use to run so
many accounts or either that or they
just spend all day posting Instagram
accounts which would suck this is kind
of all over the place but I thought this
was really interesting I'm going to I'm
gonna grab my tea I just crazy crazy let
me know what you think about this let me
know if you've heard anything about it
um I thought of a boy crazy I was so
excited to share with it
I mean I've sucked so I spent 20 bucks
to it we've had in waste like thousand
dollars like some people spend on a
shout-out we'll never ever in my life
and then I get any more information on
this maybe I can make a part 2 maybe I
can like try and like ask the fashion
inspiration accounts like tell me what
you're doing I doubt they're going to
give me any other information but maybe
I'll try but I love you guys it very
