first time from Charming Charlie I got a
few different accessories the first
thing I got are these really cute orange
booties these are so cute like a
brownish orange with cute little friends
on the side very cute for fall I'm so
excited to wear these this might be my
favorite shoe purchase like completely
from this entire project and then I also
realized I have no great shoes but have
a lot of great clothing so I got these
gray flat booties super cute also have
fringe on the side I've really got a
thing for fringe this recently and then
I also got these tan booties oh my gosh
these are like combat boots style I love
these I wanted to get the white ones but
everyone says
we're white after Labor Day and I don't
know if that really really applies but
just in case and because the fact that I
get everything really dirty really fast
I bought with the tan ones oh my gosh
these are so frickin too cute that and
then I also got this cute little studded
crossbody bag it's super cute and simple
tons of little studs on it very edgy and
fun and also really easy to grab on the
go and then to match with those orange
booties I got I got this really cute
orange like tan orange bag and I got
this a really cute white bag online I
didn't realize how big this was gonna be
I actually thought it was gonna be a
small bag but it's pretty large but I'm
actually not complaining it is pretty
different than things I normally carry
but I think it's just a really cute like
statement bag will look really trendy
and fashionable in my photos next I got
this really cute like tan over the
shoulder top it is very flowy with cute
bell sleeves it's pretty simple but I
just needed like a cute simple flowy top
I didn't really need it but I wanted it
and next I just got this black sparkly
scarf actually didn't realize it was
sparkly I thought it was just like a
plain black but I still love it I just
needed a scarf because this is like my
first real winter you guys I'm really
excited I'm excited but I'm also really
nervous so I was like okay girl needs a
scarf and this is really soft and that's
been at least from Charming Charlie got
this really really cute like shawl is
that what you call them shawl like over
the show throw over shawl type thing
sweater really beautiful it's a light
caramel color light tan with like some
dark brown accents it's got the fringe
at the bottom extremely soft this is
like wearing a blanket when you go out
somewhere so it's like how can you go
wrong with this you can't and then I got
a bunch of things from forever 21 the
first thing I got was this really cute
orange tank top very stand out flat very
very cute got this plain baby pink
sweater it's very like tight-fitting but
I think it's really cute I'll probably
wear this with like anything actually
I'm nothing specific but it was only ten
dollars so yeah girl we got this
oversized tan t-shirt I didn't realize
how oversized it was but I really
actually love it it's a very like slinky
material I don't know how to explain
it's almost like a silky tight material
in person I didn't think it was gonna be
like that next I got this black off the
shoulder
over-the-shoulder table playing black I
love the way they did the
off-the-shoulder kind of like that big
fold-over type I feel like I've seen
this shirt on Regina George and Mean
Girls if I'm right I'm gonna insert a
picture if I'm wrong I suck and then
this next shirt is just an olive green
like tight fitted top and Ikes I got
this mustard yellow t-shirt this looks
like so much smaller than I thought it
was gonna be I didn't think this was
supposed to be a crop top
it wasn't cropped on the photo online
but it's definitely cropped in person I
do still like it
I just didn't know it wasn't me cropped
so maybe I would have ordered a size
bigger next time just so I could have
like a full t-shirt and then I was
really pretty like plain
sweater type sure it's very thin
material I love the red color it matches
my hand I don't know it doesn't but you
know and the next I got a really cute
offer over the shoulder however you say
it pink top it's also kind of a sweater
material and it also has an attached to
choker so first time Express I got these
so crazy patterned pants I don't know
what this pattern is called I know I'm
awful but these are so funky and fun and
they were on sale so I was like you know
what I normally wouldn't wear these but
who knows maybe I'll wear that I'm
actually I'm gonna make myself wear
these and since they were on sale I was
like you know let's just go for it let's
just be wild today that's my way of
being wild buying cool pants and then I
got this express like mauve pink
button-up this is like their boyfriend
button-up I love this it is so cozy on
it's so cute
you can wear this button up or just
throw over a tank top I love things like
this I'm so excited to wear this like
all the time and next I got this mustard
at yellow sweater I'm really a fan of
yellow right now it also has the
crisscross the pattern in the back this
looks really good on like this really
like it's form-fitting it's got a really
slouchy but very form-fitting look to it
which I really really love the way this
fit and next I got this really soft
sweater from Express it's kind of like a
big plaid pattern there's this huge
square pattern it's also got little
shoulder cutouts which I think it's
really fun and adds up a little bit to
it this is so soft I could just like pet
it all day and then it's got a simple a
black pleated skirt I don't really ever
wear skirts but I bought three skirts
because I was like you know I need more
things to wear if I'm trying to do this
whole
an integrative thing I'm doing sometimes
in faction videos I need more than just
pants those people want to see other
things so I'm making myself wear some
skirts and then I got some jeans from
Express Express actually my favorite
place to buy jeans just because I tend
to fit me pretty well so I got these I
think things like the boyfriend jeans
that they got tons of like holes and
distrusted NIF and then you can fold and
fold them at the bottom next I got this
a crazy silver sparkly skirt oh this is
definitely a little out of my comfort
zone but that's what's that's important
in life guys I love this thud you know
they really found the committed grunge
grungy t-shirt and my Doc Martens I
don't know I like it I'm going to New
York soon I want something really fun to
wear so I feel like I might wear this
when I go and then I got another skirt
this is like a velvety material skirt
really pretty it's actually like a navy
blue black and you can kayak on camera
but when you look in person it's almost
like a dark navy blue black and next I
got this white over the shoulder top
it's got that really cool like super
super like Belle puffed sleeves this
isn't actually something I would
typically buy and even on I wasn't sure
if I loved it but it was on sale I think
this was like 9 bucks and I was like you
know I could make this look really cool
it would be different out of my comfort
zone just like that skirt so I got it I
just got it anyway next I got a dark
bluish grey body sue but is actually an
over-the-shoulder a body sue and it has
a bell sleeves
I'm loving the bell sleeves right now I
think they're really fun and I got this
jacket here from Express as well it's
like a light tan fake leather jacket or
faux leather guess you would call it
very simple but also very very stylish
very perfect for like a staple jacket
got three pairs of shoes the first one
are these pointed 'full act of these
they have cute little studs all over
them
and then they also slip up in the back I
also got these shoes these are like a
leopard print flat as well they have a
really cute lace up detail but they have
zippers in the back so you think you
have to lace them up but really just zip
them and they all ready to look lace so
it just like looks really cute but easy
to put on who can complain and last but
not least from expressing out these
really cute like almost a burnt orange
iran heel oh I love these
not the best of walking in these kind of
heels but I'm gonna learn actually
realize I have two more things that I
forgot about I did get two things from
PacSun as well I got these really cute
baby pink skinny jeans pretty simple but
I thought they were fun I don't have any
colored jeans so I thought that would be
really fun and I also got this black
cardigan I actually visit that entire
look those pants a in this cardigan I
stole not not stole I bought it well I
stole one of the employees who's wearing
those pink pants and this black cardigan
I was like your outfit is so cute and
she's like oh both of it's in the store
and so I just bought the whole thing so
I also got this black cardigan because I
looked really cute with those pants and
this actually isn't very comfortable
though it's pretty itchy but it's okay
maybe I'll wear the long-sleeve so it's
warm but not itchy so that is everything
that I got for my haul I hope you guys
