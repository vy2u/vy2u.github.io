today's video is going to be a get ready
with me for the first day of school my
full hair makeup and outfit I hope you
guys are excited let's go ahead and get
started now I'm starting off with more
my favorite things which is a face mask
I'm using a sheet mask from bio bell I
actually recently got my diary of beauty
secrets facial kit at Ulta now the bio
belt sheet masks are honestly incredible
first off they're really fun to put on
but they have caused my skin to be so
healthy and glowing smooth and
moisturized it's actually made the way
my makeup go on be so much smoother and
like cleaners my makeup looks so
incredible after using these outlet you
can tell my skin is glowing afterwards
and even better like I actually am NOT
using foundation anymore as you'll see
my skin has gotten so incredible since I
started using them I was putting on
moisturizer and I'm skipping foundation
so next I'm just going straight into my
concealer I'm just using my Maybelline
instant age rewind and I will blend that
out with a blending brush then I'm just
going to set that with a little bit of
powder and go on to my eyes I'm just
taking a medium brown and putting this
on my lower lash line it can be a little
bit messy at first no big deal cuz then
we're going to take a clean brush and
blend that line out so it's not so harsh
next I'm going to do my eyebrows and of
course my winged liner but I obviously
couldn't do that on camera and finish my
eyes off with some mascara
well my face I'm just doing a little bit
of contouring and then I'm going to end
my face with some blush and then just
top it off with a little bit of like
tinted chapstick or tinted lip balm that
I got from covergirl this is one of
those like the oat that what are they
the Osho sugar lip balms for my hair I'm
gonna start off by clipping my hair
extensions and I'm using my luxy hair
these are these strawberry blonde ones
to match my strawberry gingery blonde
hair nests I love them so much they're
really easy to clip in and they blend in
really nicely and now I'm just using my
simply straight now this is incredible
this is literally a hairbrush that
straightens your hair when I first got
this I felt like graveyard girl doing
like the try out products like does this
thing work yes it does you literally
just brush under your hair and it leaves
it smooth and straight it detangles it
and then it's like the bristles are
basically the wrapped and ceramic first
off no idea what I'm doing here girl
chill out um basically heats up your
hair so it straightens it just like a
real straightener with less damage like
I am still in all everytime I use this
even washing this back I'm like whoa
look at the difference of before and
after is incredible now onto the outfit
now please remember every dress code is
completely different so for me I chose a
really cute denim skirt that I got from
brandy melville and paired that with a
mint green tank top it was also from
brandy melville I just added on my
converse so a few rings in a simple gold
necklace and it was good to go
