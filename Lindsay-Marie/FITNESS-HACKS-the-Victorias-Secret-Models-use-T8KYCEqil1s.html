or welcome with you our new today's
video is my Victoria Secret model life
hacks Fitness life hacks now before you
started this video is never ever ever
supposed to be about looking like a
certain person feeling bad about
yourself body shaming yourself or
feeling bad at all you should love the
body you already have love the body you
are given because your body is beautiful
be happy with yourself feel good feel
happy this video is about feeling
healthy feeling happy on the inside this
is not to look like a specific
Victoria's Secret model this is just the
workouts in the diets that they use this
is not trying to look like a certain
person please love the body you are
already given but if you want to feel
how healthier and good on the inside
that is still awesome and the number one
thing I looked up about all Victoria
Secret models is they talk about a
healthy diet now they say them number
one thing is to not look at it as a diet
just learn and teach your body to enjoy
good food before you know it's not like
I'm like oh my gosh I hate dieting oh my
gosh I hate eating this food it's gonna
be more about like oh my gosh I'm so
excited to eat this food that's good for
my body now one thing that I always talk
about all the time is meal prepping and
that's something all of the models have
promoted a lot I know a lot of them said
they also have people that cook for them
every day but this girl does not have
the money for someone to cook for me I
also don't want to have someone cook
curry I don't have the time for that
I'll have the money for that so I'd
rather we're just meal prep which a lot
of them also do as well now one thing I
want to show you myself if you're
someone who is looking to meal prep is
to try out deep jaxa fit packs this is
my life saver me and I both use these
they are our go-to every single day so
basically this is a meal prep box and it
comes with your entire day's worth of
meal prep containers this is insulated
to keep all of your food like how it's
like cooled it's also got an ice pack
you also have your daily worth of
vitamins you can slip in the pouch right
here I missed the pouch cuz I look into
the camera and it also has a bottle for
a protein shake so when you have this
you can fill it up with all of your
healthy food throughout the day take
this with you whether you're at the gym
whether you're at the mall and instead
of going to grab a fast food you already
have meals ready for you now what I like
to do is I'm meal prep like on Sunday
night for the entire week and then every
single morning I would scoop it into my
containers fill it up have this free
frozen and ready to go
follow my vitamins that I take half my
protein shake zip it up and I'm good to
go for the entire day now also I will be
giving away a Jax fit pack at the end of
this video so definitely make sure to
watch the entire video because I will be
giving one of these away now really good
meal prep for the day the Angels do that
I also think is very similar to mine is
for breakfast now I know some people are
vegan vegetarian or neither so I'm just
going to tell you the types of foods and
like the types of meals and then you can
make it work for you so typically for
breakfast I and they will also do
something for protein I like to do a
protein shake here in my bottle and then
lots of fruit will be in my first
container I will do tons and tons of
fruit for breakfast with my protein
shake and then for lunch it is time for
some carbs something to fuel you
throughout the day so typically for
lunch carbs and vegetables get a lot of
veggies in there and a lot of carbs and
then for dinner it's a little bit of
everything that's when you want to get
all your veggies a little bit more
protein a little bit more carbs if
you'll use it for the rest of the night
make sure you got some fiber in there
make sure you got all your vitamins and
stuff and then when you be eating a
daily servings of like you know all your
veggies all your fruits all your carbs
you know all your protein then after all
that you're like ooh now I actually
deserve that slice of apple pie okay so
now it's time to get into the workouts
what they do
number one is interval training so what
you want to do this is a really big fat
burner really good for cardio is to do
interval training which is where you
work really hard for one to two minutes
like really push yourself just for one
to two minutes and then take 1 to 2
minutes of a break so I think when you
know you only have one to two minutes
ago of workout and you have this long
break in between
you're really gonna push yourself and
also you can just do this for 20 minutes
3 4 days a week and you're gonna notice
some crazy crazy results number 2 is to
get heavy by getting heavy I mean use
some weights now I'm not saying to go
overboard but it's actually proven that
using weights really does not always
bulk you up if you're not going insane
just add a little bit of weights into
your routine you're going to notice
you're gonna tone up a lot faster and it
really does stimulate muscle growth in
fat burning we're like fat loss so
definitely add a little bit of weights
into your workout the next thing our
plyometrics now this is something that I
you have not put into our workout but
now that I've learned about it I'm going
to so I had to pull up some information
because I wasn't super familiar but
plyometrics is basically when you
involve jumping or hopping into your
workout now it says plyometrics are
really great for sculpting your body or
especially your quads and your glutes
and it's also really great to burden
loads of calories now two examples of
some good plyometrics are jumping lunges
in box lunges another thing is circuit
training this really goes along for me
with interval training circuit training
is when you've picked like five to ten
different workouts you want to do when
you go through and like in a circuit so
what I like to do is with my interval
training is I will pick five workouts
maybe what we're gonna do squats
push-ups jumping jacks lunges and
sprinting so what you will do is one to
two minutes of jumping jacks then take
them to a minute break two minutes of
push-ups take a break two minutes of
lunges take a break and that's what you
do you just keep going in a circle until
you are tired out that way you're
working out everything and not just
working out one group at a time you just
get in a full body workout
the last thing I see they do is spinning
in bar classes now I am a big believer
in spinning and Barre classes I love
them both now they can be a little
pricey so if you don't want to spend a
lot of money you can also do bar there's
a lot of like at-home Barre workout suit
you can do in most gyms actually usually
have a cycle machine or like a you know
stationary bike that you can actually
spin on yourself however if you are
looking to join a class spin classes and
Barre classes I definitely recommend
join them with a friend most of them
have like three weeks to start out to
try it and I really think being in a
group surrounded by people really pushes
you to do your best and really pushes
you to want to keep going guys that is
