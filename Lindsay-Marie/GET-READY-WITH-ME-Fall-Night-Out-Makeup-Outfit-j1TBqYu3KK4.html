are we only
hey guys welcome back to my channel
today's video is a makeup whoo makeup
and outfit video I was gonna do my hair
but I actually as you can tell I
actually dyed my hair today so I just
blow dried it and left it how it is
because I don't need to be putting too
much heat on it today because it's a
little fried but we won't talk about
that anyways today's video is a fall
going out look I'm actually going out
somewhere tonight so i thought i would
show you my makeup in my outfit for
going out also warning I am NOT a makeup
artist I'm just gonna go and put that
out there I'm just doing my best night I
just thought this would be really fun
plus you guys request these kind of
videos all the time and I just wanted to
give it a go alright so without further
ado let's go ahead and get into the
video starting off i'm just using my NYX
HD concealer in the shade light i'm
going to conceal under my eyes in a
triangle motion a little bit on my
forehead down the bridge of my nose
that's above my lips and a little bit on
my chin
who finished off of the face part i'm
going to set my under eye concealer
highlight the tops of my cheekbones and
my forehead and then i'm going to
contour the hollows of my cheeks my
temples below my jawline and my nose and
last i'm going to go in with a pretty
pink blush and that is it for the face
heart then i'm going to go in and do my
eyes and i'm going to start off by using
a black eyeliner to line my top
waterline and then i'm going to use my
new younique moodstruck addiction shadow
palette which is absolutely stunning so
first I'm just taking the shape chipper
from my younique moodstruck addiction
one palette and it is so stunning it is
a beautiful like deep brown and it
blends out so well oh my gosh i'm in
love with the shade and then i'm going
to taking a deeper like denser crease
brush and taking the shade forthright
and just evening up this look in the
very very inner like outer third of my
eye just a little bit and oh my gosh I
little even love with each eye shadows
the cup utiful knees are like yes girl
yes and the next i'm going in with the
shade burasi and i'm going to use a flat
shader brush and I'm going to put this
all over my lid to add a lot of sparkle
and really make my eyes pop and really
to your finish off the look and then I'm
going to take the color related just to
highlight my brow bone if I'm just
lining my top lash line with two of my
younique moodstruck forces and pencils
first time using frame which they really
light like golden brown and then I'm
going in with perfect which is a dark
matte black I'm just going to bring
these where the black is on the outer
half and the brown is on the inner half
and then obviously it's time to fill in
my eyebrows I don't do much to them I
just pretty much follow up my same shape
and I just fill in all these sparse
areas and now for my lashes i'm using
the unique 3d fiber lash + which is
literally insane when will increase your
lashes by up to like four hundred
percent first you just take the gel and
the first tube and you put this all over
your lashes a really good coat and this
is going to give something for your the
fibers to stick to and then you take the
fibers which come in like a drone like a
dry wand and you just brush these onto
your lashes and literally you will watch
them become so the luminous long thick
and beautiful I let's start a little
clip of what it looks like after you
apply the fibers and
like you're wearing falsies without
having to put falsies on and then last
but not least you're taking the gel
again and put it over the fibers and
over your lashes just to make sure that
everything is going to stick and stay
all day and then last but not least to
finish off this look I'm using my unique
stiff upper lip lip stain in the shade
sad now on to my outfit my top in my
necklace are both from fashion Nova my
pants are from boohoo and my shoes are
big black strappy wedges from fabric
they're actually become whole to walk in
my sunglasses are product but I got them
from a website called ditto my watch is
from daniel wellington i think that is
actually in for my outfit in all these
detail
