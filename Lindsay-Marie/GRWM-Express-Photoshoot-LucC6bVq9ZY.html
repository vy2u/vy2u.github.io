or welcome if you are new today's video
is actually going to be a get ready with
me for a holiday photo shoot with some
of my good friends as well as some
behind the scenes of the shoot now I am
super excited because this video is
actually in collaboration with express
for their newest campaign I have always
been a huge fan of Express as you should
probably already know I wear their items
on the daily and literally 99% of my
closet is from Express I really love
that all their apparel makes me feel
very confident but also very comfortable
and if you know me by now you know
confidence and comfortable
comfortability is that the right word or
like my two of favorite things in the
world so for this first outfit I went
with something a bit more casual I
picked out these low-rise dark-wash of
barely boot jeans they're so comfy and I
paired it with this white ruched sweater
which is also super warm and super soft
and looked perfect for the first a
photoshoot location this was such a
perfect everyday cold-weather outfit we
shot this first outfit in front of some
Christmas trees outside and we even shot
in a random businesses Lobby and we may
have got a bit too loud and a bit too
excited and we're basically told it was
fine that we shot there but to please
not ever come back so but at least it
was we got cute photo so it was totally
worth it
now for the second outfit I chose this
gorgeous orange velvet jumpsuit this is
definitely what I will be wearing for
any New Year's or holiday party that I
go to this year obviously I will wear a
jacket with it I'm just like not wearing
a jacket cuz we're taking photos but I
felt so fabulous in this jumpsuit
now we shot this outfit in like the top
of an apartment building downtown where
I live now this building is actually
where Noah and I are looking to move
into next year unless we decide to move
to like LA or New York which is actually
still a possibility but either way adds
so much fun during this photo shoot
thanks to my wonderful friends for
helping me out with this video and again
to express I have all the items linked
down below
so now on to get ready with me
so for my makeup I just started out with
my primer and then I'm using my bare
minerals foundation a my very first ever
a Beauty Blender yes guys your girl is
moving up in the world totally kidding I
just want to finally try one but I have
still been going in with lighter
coverage even though I actually had some
breakout for this but I was like
whatever it's fine embracing it huh then
I used my Born This Way concealer which
is my Holy Grail and I top that off with
a pressed powder now I actually only put
the pressed powder exactly on my
concealer nowhere else because my face
is a little dry actually it's like super
dry but then I go in with my profusion
brow palette and seriously guys this is
ten dollars and you need it in your life
it is like chain it's so good I love it
and now I'm going on well first I'm
drinking some coffee but I'm going on to
bronze up my face using my Too Faced
milk chocolate Soleil bronzer
yeah pretty simple not too much just a
little bit of bronze and must face in my
nose and all that good stuff
and then I'm using my Tarte Amazonian
clay blush and I'm going in with the Too
Faced Pro glow palette now for my eye
shadow I'm using my Jaclyn hill morphe
palette now I'm not a makeup artist but
I'd say I did pretty well you guys I was
like giving myself an A+ but I just used
a shimmery pink on the lid a neutral
brown on the crease and deepened up the
outer corner with a dark brown then
somehow the magical makeup guides were
somehow on my side and I did this winged
liner and I was like woah I did not
think that was gonna come out like that
impressed with myself and then I went
back and applied some mascara my lip
liner some lip gloss and then last but
not least I applied my falsies and I've
actually gotten pretty good at applying
these lately like I feel like it's
almost like a practice makes perfect and
I just keep practicing so I'm getting
better now on to the hair for the shoot
we had our gorgeous gorgeous super sweet
friend Maddy come and style everyone's
hair seriously she did such a good job
she's actually the same hairstylist that
put in my tape and extensions I love her
if you're in the Columbus area I
definitely recommend to check her out
now anyways for my hair she did some
really really
big curls and she did like this little
half-up half-down twist thing I'm not
sure what to call it but it's gorgeous
everyone's hair looks so good I
definitely have pictures of my Instagram
