just kidding if you did watch my how to
grow your Instagram and you'll notice
I'm wearing the exact same else but I
just finished filming that but I want to
keep going also I just noticed I was not
centered in my camera but now I am hello
guys welcome back or welcome if you are
new my name is lindsey marie and i make
videos all about fashion style lifestyle
occasionally fitness and just everything
girly and in between that i can think of
to subscribe if you like my videos if
you like what i do here because i upload
new videos every thursday and sunday if
you don't want to miss it then click
that button and make sure you give this
video a thumbs up if you like this
Instagram series and if it keeps getting
enough thumbs up and you guys keep
liking these and I will continue doing
them because I love Instagram if you
love Instagram and we can all just love
Instagram but today feels how to lay
your Instagram theme or how to have an
Instagram style if you're excited then
give us a thumbs up if you haven't
already and let's get sided number one
is decide what you appreciate versus
what you will can realistically post
every day now I love when people have
the super white Instagram theme or the
really dark themes or all these
different ones but that doesn't
necessarily mean that I want to post it
so you have to realize you can
appreciate a theme without it being your
theme number two is to look at your own
lifestyle and council photos you're
going to post think about your life you
eat a lot of fun food places do you take
a lot of do you love your outfit do you
love your pet think about realistically
what your lifestyle brings it out to
figure out what photos go on to your
feed anyways and think about what colors
and lighting patterns tend to be in a
lot of those things that you look at
every day if that makes a lot of sense
if you tend to do a lot of things at
night you're somebody likes to go out a
lot you do lots of darks like stuff at
night you wear all black or stuff like
that and maybe a dark theme is perfect
for you but if you're someone who loves
getting up early and going for a morning
run and you love going you know doing
lots of outdoorsy stuff in the daytime
and you wear a lot of bright colors and
you might find a brighter team is better
for you never country is realizing
you've got you have to give yourself
some leeway Instagram yes is about
posting your photos posting your life
so don't ever let your theme take over
your life don't make it feel like you
can't share a moment so you really want
to share because of a theme so also know
it's really okay to mix and match
Almond if it really is going to hue
happier because sometimes we take photos
they just didn't match what we did our
Instagram theme but who cares post it
anyways
it'll be okay it's just Instagram
another thing to do is look at a bunch
of inspiration pages that you tend to
look at a lot and ask yourself what do I
like about these pages do I like the
colors they're using do I like how
bright or dark their photos are do I
like your photo grid patterns like maybe
they do a food post a selfie pose or
landscape pose and then they repeat that
figure out what it is that you like from
those inspiration pages and maybe you
can try and pull different things from
different inspiration pages to try and
make your own new theme as well and
that's just suicide you you want it to
have to take photos in the same lighting
pattern every day for a bright or dark
scene or would you rather do it the
simple way like I do and just put the
same a filter on every photo I perfect
person I think that's the easiest thing
to do i most my photos do tend to be
taken in the daytime bright time but I
never take little on just a white wall
or just in dark colors or anything like
that I take photos everywhere my outfit
style changes every day I never know I'm
going to do so what I like to do is use
the same filter on every photo what I do
is I use vsco cam
I just took I just kind of experimented
one day with all the filters and Tarr
figured out which one do I love and
which one can I realistically see myself
posting every single time it kind of
looks good on all of my photos and then
I stuck with it and I only use that
filter and that is me it's so much
easier for me every time I post the
picture next if you practice your posing
in front of the camera that's also
random for an Instagram theme but I
honestly think it's important because I
feel like if you get frustrated in front
of the camera and you just are
uncomfortable and you get really nervous
that it will kind of show in your photos
and the best thing about an Instagram
theme is when you feel fun and happy and
you're the show in your own life so make
sure too that you aren't going to claim
up in front of the camera a good thing
to do is practice in front of a mirror
or just go out with your friends and
take photos just for fun with no notion
of having to post them online and just
do it for fun until you get comfortable
in front of the camera next is a really
easy one as that is to have a texting
Instagram now what I do sometimes I will
use a fake Instagram account that is
completely private that no
Elsie's and i will post my photos on
that instagram first just to decide what
order i like as sometimes one photo may
not look good next to the other one but
if i move them around a little bit they
will fit perfectly so I use a second
Instagram account just to post my photos
move them around to the order I like and
that just makes it so easy the next one
is showing your personality through your
captions now no matter what your theme
is you want people to want to look at
your photos you want them to like you
you want them to come back so try to
show your personality pull funny silly
things in your caption or post cute
clothes or just journal your heart out
so your caption to you know get people
to know you and I feel like that is a
good way even though that has nothing to
do with really your theme but to keep
people coming back and liking your stuff
next is looking at your quality and your
quantity so at first I like to make sure
all of my photos are sharp and focused I
never post any photos that is super
blurry focus it's a little too dark that
could it be brightened up or something
and then when it comes to quality may be
figuring out are you going to post once
a day two or three times a day like some
people do or maybe posting once a week
and that can really help you decide on
your theme because if you aren't any
posting 3 times a day you may not want
to do an all-white Instagram because
that's going to take a lot of work so if
you are going to posting a lot of photos
it might be simpler just to have one
filter you put on all your photos that
way it saves you a lot of time and last
but not least is trying to change up the
angles and the spacing I try not to post
like 3 full bodies back-to-back like
I'll do a full body and a headshot and a
photo with me and Noah and I'll kind of
switch it up because you'll notice that
as a whole on your feed it looks so much
better if you have different angles and
different spacings in your photos
instead of having the same one over and
over and over okay guys so those are my
tips for how to have a great Instagram
