welcome to fewer new space video in
house of granite every single photo plus
clicks on my Instagram tips and tricks
and hacks and all that good stuff
I have 15 15 different tricks and tips
and all this stuff so I am so excited
for this video now if you did not know
my background is actually in photography
ciphered I have a lot of insight in this
I actually went to college for art I
specialized in photography stock
photography really being my area I have
shopped for Urban Outfitters I have high
work featured in vogue I've been in a
few magazines I worked with a ton of
different fashion models and agencies I
definitely know what I'm talking about
so I thought I would give you tips and
tricks IOR through photography school if
you're working with different models and
all that good stuff a hostess got this
video helps you and let's go ahead and
jump right in but first one is a little
trick I like to do that is angling
myself away from the camera even if you
think I'm straight towards you we can
set up being straight on to the camera
what I like to do is take my hips push
them back and then turn the rest of me
towards the camera and that's just going
to make my my waist up a little bit
smaller can give me more of a curve
instead of me being straight on it just
kind of square to the camera so I'm
going to put in one leg in front now you
think tons of people do this I probably
would notice what everyone does this and
that is because it really makes your
legs look longer when you can see both
of your legs and really just elongate
your legs makes them look longer it
makes them look thinner makes it look
great so definitely put one leg in front
of the other hope your foot on one cue
and that's going to make your life with
even longer even thinner and even sexier
now the only thing you have to do with
your camera angle looks a little realize
they don't like your photos it doesn't
have anything to do with you have to do
with the angle of your camera so if you
want to look taller and slimmer to half
a person hold the phone or the camera
lower than you actually aren't going to
make you look taller
another thing you
someone take your photos for you to
frame the photos beforehand we just need
to know do this all the time when like
if you taking a photo of me or like
someone's taking a photo of us I will
take my phone I will do it okay so this
is I will take a photo of the area so
this is what I want to see in the soil
notice I really stand right with the
photo has been taken from you stand in
that exact spot that way I know that I'm
getting exactly what I want another
thing is to follow inspiration there so
people that are great on Instagram with
posing facial expressions all the
different stuff so follow it tons of
times you're going to Calais keep the
following if you want a help and look at
their photos beforehand look at their
poses look at what they're doing that
really gives you a lot of ideas for
expressions and way to move your body I
definitely think following Instagram
accounts that really give you ideas is
one of the best things I love looking
ideas before I go out and take photos
another thing when someone is taking the
photos for you is to go ahead and be
posed and face ready you know obviously
if you're going out to your girlfriend's
and you plan on taking photos all day
then don't worry about this but think
you're just going to ask like a random
birthday or looking you're your family
member to take a photo of you and you
don't want to be there all days when you
get the photo over with then go in front
of your mirror and figure out the exact
pose you're going to do figure I'll need
Xpression you're going to do a hold on
figure out all of your angles and
everything so that way when you go out
you show them where to take the photo
you can't do all your poses which you
already know you're going to do they
take one shot and you are good to go
next our fake candid fake pages are a
great way to really make your photos
seem more realistic and more like
someone's there with you versus super
cozy all the time now one thing I like
to do is when I'm taking photos with
friends sometimes we'll all think of a
really fun way to pose and that makes
every review I did that with my friends
recently add up an event
another thing is that we will fake laugh
together or we'll have a conversation
like we're all someone's taking the
photo you have a coffee drink your
coffee if you're having a cool shirt
place your shirt you know it's kind of
make it more candid use what you got and
kind of work with it the next one
involved lighting now most people will
tell you to shoe in the shade I don't
necessarily agree and I will say
mutawafee' back up I realized you don't
always need she'd no shade is a great
way if you really just want take a photo
not to worry about it
shade and overcast lighting is great
however
Paige can also make your photos with a
little flat and dull that's why most
photographers like real photographers
will shoot in natural light most awkward
love goals an hour
you love early morning to the Sun is
great now obviously the Sun is super
harshly a strenuous then use of the
shade is going to be better but early
mornings around 4 o'clock the Sun is so
great it's so many different lighting
patterns you can use like sine hiding
makes your face will really like to find
front lighting make she looks really
toned back lining just makes you look
you have those beautiful golden aura
around you there's so many different
lighting patterns you can plateless
so I definitely recommend looking up
your lighting patterns and realizing
there's totally different opportunities
of opportunities to shoot in so many
different lighting situations that
aren't just shade another thing is when
you are shooting out on the bright harsh
light actually learning this stuff from
Carly Christmas close your eyes look up
at the Sun count to three and if for
some reason your eyes kind of adjust the
Sun a little bit more so when you open
your eyes back up and looking at the
camera your eyes are not watering it's
not like super squinty so for some
reason you can't handle it you're taking
photos that are like body taste maybe
you're looking your swimsuit maybe
you're done fitness or maybe you're just
showing off the more that skin girdle
work it my face on screen and some kind
of baby oil really makes you look more
toned I think it's just like the oil
minute because really glistens off in
your body into the Sun and it really
makes you look more contoured and more
highlighted so work with the stylist
created you have for Texas skin anyways
next one is when you were taking slimmer
sitting down and now this can be tricky
for a lot of people but all you need to
do is angle your body to one side and
kind of come up off of your legs a
little bit so most people when we sit
down we tend to squash into our feet you
know it's more comfortable to stay
squished with no space for your photos
for just a moment you know like angry
your body a little to the side put your
butt on with your booty on one side of
the chair and the count of three just
lift your legs up just slightly don't
like strain yourself but just slightly
pop your legs up so not squish onto the
seat the next one is
foreground/background
I just always I've been doing this for
every single one I'm done I promise I'm
done foreground/background
I want to be cool I can still I still
here my photography teacher like in the
back of my mind yelling at me
foreground/background I really hear that
in my nightmares but it's so true so it
doesn't matter what your for grounded in
the photo poor ground being yourself
your background actually really does
matter now don't look in my background
for filming does not remember miss but
me taking your photos knows the
background doesn't matter a little bit
if you have a super messy background in
the area like it's kind of distracting
so this kind of a look at your
background a little bit more when you're
taking your photos and then with a
camera or DSLR sometimes it does crop
some of the photo out on Instagram so
what you should do if you're taking a
photo and it's not with your phone even
with your phones was kind of still is a
good idea just in case make sure to add
a little extra room above your head in a
little extra room below your feet that
way when you put it on Instagram if it
crops on the photo op it's still then
crop any of your body out because
there's so many times I would take
photos with my camera it would be the
cutest like full body photo then put it
on Instagram I'd be like wait like it
cropped down off my forehead it crops
off my shoes my photos ruined so
definitely leave extra room on your
photos that way when Instagram crops it
it doesn't crop out you and Alaska is
amusing now music is a great way to
really get in the mood for your photos
think of the type of folder you have
take are you doing like a grungy photo
are you doing a really preppy up upbeat
pop photo are you doing something more
cool and you know sophisticated and play
that type of music so notice the music
really does look into you with the
minute if you want to be in so play
music official photo that you want to
take I can kinda see it for my video
