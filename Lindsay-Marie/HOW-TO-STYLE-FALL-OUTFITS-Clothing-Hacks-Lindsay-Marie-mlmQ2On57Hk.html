you are new
my name is Lindsey Murray today's video
is going to be my summer to fall fashion
transition I'm not sure exactly what I'm
going to call this yet but I'm sure
you'll tell from the title and the
thumbnail but basically um you know hi
Oh leaves I'm sure it's to say most
places we have this nice time when it
goes from summer to fall when it's
sometimes it's really warm sometimes
it's really cool some days it's like
right in the middle and it's like you
know it's like really actually it's my
favorite time of the year I feel like
that it but in between time when it's
not too hot it's not too cold and you
kind of can get away with fall clothes
and summer clothes so I thought I would
share with you four different ways that
I like to save all my summer clothes and
pair them for fall outfits or those like
summer to fall outfits I know in the
comments are you guys excited for fall
I'm so excited I'm excited do a lot of
fall fashion videos I'm so excited
but anyways go ahead and give this video
a thumbs up if you're excited for fall
and let's get started so number one has
to do with our tank tops our body suits
anything that is spaghetti strapped or
like one west kind of inch what I like
to do with all of my tank tops things
that have straps like this is pair them
with pants first off so a new kind of
denim jeans or pants that you like to
wear leggings anything like that pair
them with like a pair of pants and then
what I do is carry around some type of
cardigan or a jacket that I can throw on
top if it gets a little bit cooler maybe
that breeze comes through you have that
jacket or that cardigan and that's also
great because it's a little too hot
right now for me to wear little long
sleeves and a cardigan but I could
definitely wear a cardigan with a tank
top underneath it same goes for a jacket
and I personally think that pairing a
cardigan or jacket on top of a tank top
instantly takes an outfit from like
casual to super stylish I think it's
such an easy way to make an outfit
really stylish as well so that is
probably my favorite way to pair a
stylish outfit and here is how I paired
mine
my second outfit is if your aren't just
quite ready to get rid of all of your
summer shoes yet maybe your sandals or
wedges anything that is open-toed that
you typically won't wear in the fall
time what I like to do is a pair that
with a super fall outfit now we have
those days where it is pretty cool but
it's not really cold yet so if I was
aware like jeans and a long-sleeve shirt
and boots I would probably be burning up
but they say that most of your like body
warmth comes from like your is it from
your feet in your head is that right so
what I like to do is maybe pair a pair
of jeans and then a long-sleeve shirt
and I'll pair it with like some sandals
or some open-toed shoes
and that way my feet are a lot cooler
compared to everything else I'm not
wearing like thick socks yet and so my
overall body temperature is still a lot
cooler but I still look like very fall
chic well fall stylish but I've got a
little bit of that summer ish summer
mist still on me as well
and here's what I paired for outfit
number two
number of threes when you're excited to
wear those like prunex sweatshirts and
hoodies but you're not ready to become
too warm or like overheated and you want
ready to maybe get rid of your skirts
and your shorts what I like to do is
pair my crew necks or my sweaters my
sweatshirts with my shorts or my skirts
especially a denim I feel like that
always looks really really cute to pair
like a denim skirt with a crewneck and
maybe like some tennis shoes there are
some converts the bans adidas whatever
you have and I feel like that's a really
cute outfit so yeah it's just it's also
a really easy go-to outfit it's very
comfy but it's also really cute as well
so here's what I did for outfit number
three
and number four is a good way to also
pair your short skirts or shorts shorts
if you want ready to get rid of those
yet maybe it's like you know at that
time this season where your legs aren't
really cold yet maybe they get a little
chilly what you can do is wear pair some
long socks with your skirts and your
shorts you can do like quarter ones it
like the ones that go below your knees
you do the ones that are size highs up
to you you can also pair it with some
tall boots as well so kind of depending
on like you know how fall that you want
to go whether you want to do like socks
and short boots socks and tall boots
either way I think that's a great way is
just pairing those short skirts and
shorts with long socks boots definite
makes you look more fallish I think
that's actually one of my favorite ways
to dress for early fall so yeah here is
outfit number four
