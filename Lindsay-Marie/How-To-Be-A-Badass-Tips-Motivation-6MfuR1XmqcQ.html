and welcome with your news today's video
is how to be a badass right we'll talk
about us but kind of also how to be
about us but before we get started I am
hosting a giveaway I'm giving away an
iPad Mini in a Fujifilm Polaroid cameras
the blue one all you have to do to enter
is want to be a subscriber into all
Instagram and I'll announce the winner
its end of February so this video is how
to be a badass or how to look like a
badass looking like about it and if you
feel like about us it means you're above
us but I mean you're badass I'm hunting
a lot more than I ever cut in my entire
life excuse that but honestly is me
saying that we're offend you you're
gonna have a hard time out there in the
real world so it's gonna be alright
I really don't cuss though but look good
it's just in the video so I feel like
when you go out on this hard scary world
smoking out I'm 23 and I know that the
world is scary out there feeling
confident and loving yourself and
feeling good about yourself is so
important like if you feel bad on
yourself you don't love what you look
like you may have thought that it didn't
matter in the morning before you left
the house so when you get all three like
wow like I wish I felt better about
myself and you'll realize over time if
you do these small things you're going
to feel so much better about yourself
and it's going to give you better
opportunities you're going to meet more
people you're going to do more things
you thought you would never do it's just
going to be great the first thing is
absolutely how you get ready in the
morning now I'm not saying that the way
I feel like that is the same way that
you feel like one because everyone has
different styles and different things
they like so what I like to do is zero
there are obviously outfits that you
wear where you feel like oh my gosh I
look incredible I feel great I feel
confident so good thing to do is have a
statement if people like three or four
types of styles that you know make you
feel good so think about what when
you're wearing service or analysis what
about those outfits make you feel good
some way you can incorporate those in
all your different outfits you know so
to me when I'm wearing like dark skinny
jeans and edgy crop top a cool choker
you know and my Doc Martens I feel like
a bad biatch you know and that makes me
feel like I can run
throughout the world all of us not just
girls all of us because we're all
beautiful but it makes me feel like I
can rhyme it the world
if you feel incredible about myself so
definitely figure out what are your
staple outfit what pieces in your closet
make you feel great and then when you're
shopping you think about those things as
well as what about my outfits
do I wanna pull out of because I will
wear these things were often Mason goes
through my hair and my makeup I felt I
was doing really bland with my hair
where there's a lot light Browns I
remember I feel cool about myself when I
had red hair so I was like you know if
it makes me feel better about myself
that I want to have right here so I
colored my hair red I don't think I like
that like my hair has texture so I like
to curl my hair more I noticed that when
I straighten my hair I feel a little bit
less less powerful it's such a small
thing I can do to make myself feel
better now another tip is whenever you
have racing days find something to make
you feel more put together a more badass
so like I said sprucing up your ponytail
maybe adding some dark lipstick that you
didn't even do it like in two seconds
before you leave the house were you even
taking the lazy day outfits like
sweatpants and a t-shirt and making them
feel a little bit more badassery so for
me those are any sweatpants and a
t-shirt you know I might cup the t-shirt
I might add a bunch of accessories
accessories really help add a few
accessories changes the shoes a little
bit you know the way you style the
outfit really can't make it go from the
kind of slouchy to oh my gosh like
that's pretty cool both know when you
run into people and you are in those
outfits in those moods we don't feel
look good so you don't want to tease
those people so when you are dressing
the way you want to dress and feeling
the way you want to feel when you meet
running people you're going to want to
talk to them socialize you're not going
to care who sees you my girl I am on top
of the world so I don't care who you are
or what you think the next one and your
posture it is what a hundred percent
proven the way you stand and hold
yourself will change the way your people
perceive you and will you perceive
yourself if you walk around with slouch
arms all punched up together
they're kind of going to feel down and
kind of like you know reserved a little
bit more repressed I don't know if the
press the press is not that's not a word
I know what I just said you know what
I'm saying a little bit more or less out
there a little bit less sociable but if
you walk her off the hand on your hips
your light a little bit farther apart
taking up more space even a smile
people are gonna think oh she's more
welcome to converse open to conversation
she's more confident she's more proud of
herself she's more likely going to want
to take opportunities it looks like
you're more of a go-getter when you
stand the way of a go-getter next is
trying out styles if you've always loved
actually I've already kind of mentioned
this but just to recover it if you
notice you're always looking at people
for certain hairstyles certain looks why
not try putting those on yourself if you
haven't already my good friend Alison
loves jbr Alison Henry I would see you
the way she dresses like oh my gosh she
is so cool or people like hey Claire and
Carly Chrisman I believe oh my gosh the
way they dress is so incredible the way
to do the makeup is so incredible and I
realized wait they all dress a little
engineer they have a little bit more
neutrals Wes color is more like you know
more more new so I said Lorna just twice
more accessories a little bit edgier
grunt here and also Queen I I'm headed
back a little edgier in grungier so I
decided to start playing with my outfits
and making the Munsell in here and
crying to it every single time I would
go out I would feel better about myself
I would feel more confident I would feel
like a badass and last not Lisa's
attitude is everything i 100% believe in
that law of attraction manifestation
your mindset is so important so if you
walk around feeling sad something bad
about yourself you're going to look like
you were sad okay so you have to change
your mindset it can be really hard at
first it's kind of like fake it till you
make it but if you walk around start
telling yourself I am confident I am
brave I am awesome I am strong I am so
cool then you are cool you are strong
you are beautiful you are awesome you're
all the things that you tell yourself
you are so definitely make sure that
your mindset is on track and also
kindness is cool I know some people
think it's cool to be mean when it's not
I have never met someone who was mean to
me and thought oh they're so cool
they're nice to people kind of people
you're like more people want to do more
things with you and that's gonna make
you happier than happier and you're
gonna feel better about yourself so you
can be cool and feel cool it look cool
with you can also be kind
so kindness is part of that coolness
