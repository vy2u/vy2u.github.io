are new my name is Lindsay Marie if you
didn't know already and today's video is
going to be how to change your life in
one minute now we all have one minute a
day to give ourselves if you don't have
one minute a day to give yourselves you
need to reprioritize or something so
today's video is going to be something
you can do for one minute a day that I
promise you you will see results and
change in your life and this is starting
off your days with one minute of
visualization
now visualization for me is when I sit
down for one minute I just set a timer
on my phone and I think about myself in
the position of already achieving my
goals now I have a vision board in front
of my bed and it has tons of goals on it
so I will sit back on my bed and
whatever picture my eye lands on first
that is a goal that I am gonna visualize
in that one minute so let's say I start
visualizing myself walking down the
aisle in my dress I picture myself in
the dress I picture Noah at the end I
picture every all of our surrounding
loved ones and the beautiful location in
Greece and I see myself for doing
walking down the aisle
now I visualize all of that I feel
incredible I feel grateful happy usually
tears well up in my eyes and then what I
notice is I start to visualize the
honeymoon I start visualizing us going
to Paris I don't notice that will lead
to another thought and then that will
lead to another positive thought and by
the time that 60 seconds is up I will
have visualized myself in three to four
incredible situations and those
situations will leave me feeling
grateful motivated to work towards my
goals ready to take on the day happy
those positive thoughts already tumbled
into more positive thoughts and over
time you will notice your whole day will
become more and more positive one
positive thought can lead to the next to
the next to the neck and also the better
part from that is you will notice that
what you think about and visualize
yourself doing will show up in your
physical world for example yesterday I
visualized myself doing yoga because
that is on my vision board and that is
something I really want to try out this
year I don't know if I'll like it but I
want to give it a real shot
so I visualize myself feeling strong and
flexible in a yoga class meeting new
people getting out of my cup
his own feeling more present in the
moment and I felt so great about it
afterwards and what do you know a few
hours later I was mindlessly scrolling
on Instagram for a minute and an ad for
a local yoga place literally 0.8 miles
from my apartment popped up on my
Instagram and I had not googled anything
about this popped up on my Instagram a
sponsored post that they were doing a
six-week beginner course starting the
very next day for a very affordable
price I was like holy crap I have to
sign up for it I signed up for the
six-week beginner course and I started
this morning so the more you visualize
things you may think it seems so silly
to do it at first but I promise you you
will notice first off how great your
mindset changes how great you feel but
you will notice things happening it may
take a few days before you know it you
will see the things you visualize like
little steps popping up out of nowhere
like calling you like hey if you want
this grab this do this go here try this
just like what three four years ago I
was living in a trailer in a very toxic
relationship with someone who didn't
care about me with a job at a hotel that
I didn't like and that was it I had no
goals to do anything else I had no
motivation to do anything I had no
dreams I just didn't know I thought this
was it and then I watched the secret and
talked about visualization I thought
well I didn't know what I wanted my
goals to be but I thought about no
moving out start starting something from
home and before I knew it I had an
opportunity to go back to college for a
photography and videography degree which
definitely helped paid off for today I
broke off that relationship I moved I
moved out of state
I met Noah and like my whole life I am
now a full-time youtuber never having to
go back to the place that I was and I
promise you visualization started it so
if you want to start and you don't think
you have the tools yet you do you have
your mind sit for one minute back on
your bed sit in a quiet place where no
one is that well you're not gonna feel
judged and self-conscious and just think
for one minute about yourself being in
the place that you want to be don't
think about how you're gonna get there
don't think about how tough it's gonna
be just picture yourself already in that
place so I hope you really enjoyed the
I love you very much let me know in the
comment what is your what is something

sure if you are new to give that
subscribe button attack turn on my

empowerment motivation feel-good content

blabbering
