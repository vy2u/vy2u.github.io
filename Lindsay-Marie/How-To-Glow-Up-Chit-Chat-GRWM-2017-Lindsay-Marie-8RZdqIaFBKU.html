watch me rock and if I can't stuff hey
guys welcome if you are new today's
video is going to be my glow-up video
you guys have been requesting this and
you love my last one so I thought this
one a little differently I'm so excited
so basically want to be like a chit chat
get ready with me video where I show you
my full hair makeup and outfit how I
typically do on a daily basis but then I
also talk through the entire video with
tips and tricks on how to glow up
yourself and these are good tips and
tricks just wait you're gonna love them
so make sure to stage with a very very
end give it a thumbs up if you're
excited and let's get started okay let
me get comfortable
let me get gum wanting a sip of my slow
dough now the first thing I'm gonna be
doing priming my face this is the pop
beauty face magnet primer I don't know
where I got this from be completely
honest okay so I'm taking my foundation
this is a pure minerals bear at all
foundation I feel like the biggest blow
up in life is gonna be your inner flow
up and you may I know something people
think that's cheesy I get comments all
the time girl like oh my gosh soon as
she talked about like inner beauty and
inner this an inspiration I couldn't
launch the video anymore and I'm like
that's weird like if that stuff bothers
you you need to take a look at yourself
so what I'm talking about is the biggest
blow up you're gonna have in life is
when you realize that you are freakin
boss biatch now real quick I'm gonna
feeler this is the Born This Way to face
concealer in light right under my eyes I
don't tend to put it all over my face I
used to and then I realized it just
makes me really pale I think I have too
light of a shade so I just do a little
bit under my eyes and on my eyelids and
that's it
so the quickest way you're going to love
yourself a lot is to number one talk
about yourself the way that you talk
about other people so for example say
that like you're obsessed with some
influencer then instead of being like oh
my gosh she is so beautiful oh my gosh
she is so hot oh my gosh she is so funny
oh my gosh she's so worthy of all the
stuff she has know and Sartain
doing that you've got to be a little
selfish even if you don't believe it
please just do it anyways like oh my
gosh I am so beautiful oh my gosh I am
so cute oh my gosh my butt looks so good
today these jeans oh my gosh like I am
so worthy of everything I'm gonna get in
life I have so many great things coming
for me and it is literally going to
change your life change your life and at
first it may seem cheesy as health girl
it may seem cheesy it seemed cheesy for
a while when I did it but it changed my
life if you guys knew my life square
which I will do with draw my life one
day whenever I get the freakin courage
to you'll understand like the global for
me was real and it was not external I've
never I looked the same that I looked in
high school and in high school I had
zero friends nobody liked me no one
thought I was pretty I was called ugly
every single day and now we get told I
need comment from you guys saying I'm
perfect and I'm not you are just as
beautiful as me you are just as
beautiful as whoever you're idolizing
you just have to realize it first before
anyone else is going to realize that
you're beautiful and perfect just how
you are
you have to realize it first okay next
I'm going to just set my under eye
concealer this is the Catrice cosmetics
prime and fine mattifying powder and
then that's what changed you first
second you need to make sure who the
heck are your friends okay who are your
friends really look at who your
friendships are with and if your friends
are not complimenting the out of
you then you need better friends you
need to be telling you your friends you
need to also be doing this telling them
on a daily basis whenever you see them
how worthy they are how beautiful they
are you need to surround yourself with
other girls or other friends and happy
females males and females other friends
that cherish themselves and cherish you
I'm gonna be doing my brows I'm using a
profusion brow makeup case let me do it
real quick oh haha oh my god oh my god I
need it really need to pluck them brows
don't want you close guys don't look too
close don't look too close okay so I'm
going to be using these soft brown color
and an angled brush I'm doing my brows
and now we're gonna get back to what I
was saying the next thing is to accept
yourself flaws and all and that may
sound cheesy as heck I do not gain
listen wow that was really
aggressive maybe that's what I need to
be okay aggressive be addressed okay no
no sorry so this is a seriously I'm a
little bit farther away now but my legs
are hurting so help or it's okay um okay
accept yourself applause and all maybe
something someone tells you about
yourself if they tell you it's your
weakness girl that does not mean it is
your freakin weakness it took me three
years of having my channel to finally
realize that the only way to be happy
with my channel is to be my freakin self
I spent literally three years where I'll
put I'll make a few videos like myself
and then I will second-guess it and feel
like being myself isn't okay and then
now that I'm starting to realize okay no
the only all my videos that do the best
or the videos where I'm being myself I
am loud I'm weird I talk really freaking
fast
I'm very quirky and I used to think that
was a bad thing okay
and I would like tone it down in my
videos and tone it down because people
thought it was annoying not like some
people get hate comments all the time
but then it's like when I finally
realized to stop caring and to just put
myself out there like that those are my
best videos the videos where I am being
myself for things that people don't like
about me end up being my best videos
because it maybe there's people that
don't like things about you okay maybe
there are people who think that you have
those weaknesses but here's the thing
those are just their size their thoughts
are not you their thoughts are just
they're freaking thoughts and do not
ever let someone's thoughts define you
think about what do you think of
yourself and if you think bad things
about yourself that's also bad like I
said the first thing you have to be your
biggest cheerleader you have to because
the only person you always have in life
is you girl energy or boy boy or girl
where was I at what's next my eye shadow
this could be really bad or really good
so that's what this is how it goes with
my eye shadow it's like it's either
really bad
I just pretend I'm gonna do it and I
just just hope that no one notices okay
so I'm gonna take this Jacqueline hit my
Jeff and help ally I love you so much
and I don't know what colors I'm using
I'm gonna start with the transition
color on my crease I'm gonna use the
gold all over my lid and it'll probably
like deepen up the outer corner with
this dark brown I was never considered
pretty in high school in school in
college no one really spoke to me until
I was on social media you don't know how
many girls that were very mean to me
tried so hard to be nice to me now like
there were times in my life and I don't
want to cry I get upset that I was told
not to sit with people I'm go to sit
with people at a table and I'm like oh
you can't sit here we don't want you to
sit here like I when I first moved to my
second school I actually switched high
schools in ninth grade because my
principal literally told my mom your
daughter is so bullied she needs a new
start you need to move her schools so we
move schools when I started my new
school it was a lot better at first I
made some really nice friends and then
as soon as I kind of realized like where
I lived or the car I was dropped off in
before you know before I knew it none of
them were my friends anymore it's crazy
because I will say the thing that is
motivated me the most in life is the
fact that I didn't grow up with a lot of
money because I knew that the only
person I could if I wanted to make a lot
of money I had to do it for myself so
that has been my biggest motivation so
those girls not be nice to me thank you
stop comparing yourself to girls on the
Internet stop comparing yourself in
general I'm but I'm just saying you
don't even understand how many people
have things done how you know they it's
Photoshop its face tuned of doing
nothing but comparing myself to girls on
the Internet and it's often all that oh
maybe I need to get lip injections done
because everyone else has lip injections
there's nothing wrong with wanting those
things at all please do not think I'm
saying they're something wrong but I
don't want to be dissing anyone I'm
saying though the way I'm thinking is
incorrect to think oh well so-and-so
everyone else is getting them done maybe
I should that is bad that is a bad way
of thinking I had to stop myself I won't
do it because I don't ever want to make
girls think like to want something
that's no that's not even real first off
no I do not face to myself I do not
photoshop myself yes I changed colors in
my photo
saturate things and use contrast but I
do not change my looks and because yes
there have been times when I wanted to
and I know that I shut it you know and
there's been times I wanted to and I
know that me doing that is gonna do
nothing but make me unhappy with myself
so it's like I have that's the best
thing you can do if you are someone who
deals with the comparing yourself to own
the internet or thinking you're not good
enough the best thing you can do is not
facing yourself don't photoshop yourself
and learn to love you just how you are
put those pictures up just how you are
good you know what you are perfect you
don't need face tune you don't need
Photoshop I feel like I just rambled so
much during my eye shadow but I hope
that when I go back and edit this like
it makes some sort of sense I might have
to cut things down and cut things out
yeah yeah there's like neighbors walking
by and they're probably like what the
hell is going on there how dare you stop
recording in the middle of your
recording sorry my camera cut out I'm
ready to take these little Welsh
missiles out for some eyeliner I don't
really do a wing or anything because I'm
not talented enough but I might try just
for you guys if it looks bad it's not my
wall so what I was thinking I could do
that for but that's not that bad okay I
don't know how I did this I don't know
how I got so lucky and who is looking
after me right now but that is not
Batman but I knew next do you guys know
I don't know okay for my friends I'm
using the Too Faced milk chocolate
Soleil bronzer just cuz I've had this
for five hundred years and it still it's
not all gone and I'm too cheap to buy
anything else okay so now I want to give
you guys some more tips every time you
go to your mirror the next two weeks
walk up and like oh my gosh I looked so
beautiful today that's all I want you to
say or actually can be like oh my god
looks so beautiful to me my butt looks
so good my hair looks so good my eyes
like so
I look so good oh my gosh you can say
that if you want to that's even better
but I don't care if it feels like the
fakest thing you've ever said in your
life I want you to do it for like two
weeks and then by the end of two weeks
you will notice that you'll be walking
up to your mirror and not even realizing
it and be like wow I really do look
freaking bomb AF today and it'll be kind
of like part of your natural routine and
it'll be so good for you but this girl
you've watched so beautiful boy you are
so beautiful girl boy whoever's watching
you or I'll be a woman anyone who
watches my video to be feeling like no
matter what the content is be feeling
like oh my gosh I can take over the
world cuz you can't you know it's being
like oh you can be like a little
positive plaintiff the plaintiff who
actually takes over the world
in a good way and I did not in a bad way
don't do anything that and then don't
and if you do something bad I didn't
tell you to do that because I want you
to monitor your thoughts now they might
that may sound a little like how the
hell do you do that and girl I don't
know it took me a long time to be able
to do it I noticed myself saying the
most hateful things to myself like wow
you look like Wow your hair looks
awful almost like really awful things
and it's like what is wrong with you
like if you are thanks to you who's
gonna be nice to you if you've got to be
nice to you first I've got to be nice to
me first so I want you to monitor your
thoughts and when you hear yourself
saying something means yourself stop try
and stop your talking back wall wait do
I really want to be talking to myself
like that
not really my tart tart iasts artist
sardius time to get to party - yes Pro
Go Pro glow palette and I'm using the
lid shade and the strobe shade I'm using
this one on my face and this one also on
my face you get the point I'm a you
probably don't I'm probably really
confusing you if my feet are not okay
so there's nothing wrong with liking
yourself with makeup and there's nothing
wrong with appreciating yourself with
makeup on but you have to love yourself
as you as well because if not you're
gonna always find yourself feeling like
you're not good enough and you need to
be always if you really want to have a
glow up you want to be able to leave the
house bare face almost a bare naked bare
face a hair however it is naturally and
you're you want to be able to leave your
house that way and still feel confident
this is the so
or a sexy mother pucker in super nude
matte this is my this is my shade in the
whole world
okay next I want you to listen to the
way you talk about other people as well
you're like oh my gosh so on so I hate
her hair and then think about why does
that bother you
why is her hair bother you it should it
and then the more you talk about other
people the more negative you're inside
they're gonna be about yourself a real
quick these are the sleep styler these
are not sponsored I bought these at Bed
Bath &amp;amp; Beyond this doesn't give me like
super curly curls it gives me more like
nice waves hey I might go and add a few
more curls just gonna I'm in the mood
for like some like curly curls curly
curls curly fries that's what I'm in the
mood for I think my biggest thing for
glowing up is literally you have to
ignore other people the most successful
people the happiest people in the world
don't care about what their neighbors
say they don't care about what their
enemies say they don't care about the
girl at the lunch table next to you say
they don't care about what their
co-workers say they're just like I said
if you're thinking bad thoughts about
someone it's on you if they're thinking
bad thoughts about you it's on vent okay
so now I'm gonna do my favorite quick I
do like the way it turned out but I
haven't curled my hair one since I got
extensions I just want to use this new
curling iron because this is the Abela
me a graveyard girl collaboration and
this is the coolest barrel ever oh my
god I love it so much I'm wearing Bombay
hair extensions these are the bomb 8a
pins I do love these this is the Bellamy
curling iron Bellamy Bombay that's a
little confusing 1 2 3 4 5 somebody call
a friend oh my tits out it goes that's
not how that goes
it's from the bottom of my heart from my
personal experience if you are going
through something in life right now this
is completely different firm going up if
you're going through something hard in
school maybe you don't have friends
maybe you have some issues at home
please know that does not define your
worth that does not define your glow up
you know what that means
it means you are gonna do better things
and lights and what your what's going on
now okay so if something is out of your
control right now please know my harness
with you I have been through these
things and I love the out of you go
home and cry all the time because girls
just didn't like me you know and those
girls if they've apologized now so if

like you know that one day they are
gonna be sending you messages and

apologizing to you where you're at in
life what is going on just know you can
also always have a glow up you can
