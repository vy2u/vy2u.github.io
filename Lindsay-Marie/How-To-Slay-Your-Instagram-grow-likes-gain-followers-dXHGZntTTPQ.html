welcome with your new yes I know I'm
wearing something a little riskier than
normal this is actually the item that
was backordered that I talked about in
my Tiger mist haul and I really just
want to wear it it does feel a little
awkward for me but it's okay I like it I
hope you guys like it I don't know um
but also if you like the videos that I
put up here please if you don't mind go
ahead and hit that subscribe button
right down here I upload new videos
every Thursday and Sunday so if you do
hit subscribe to never miss an upload
also say video is how to grow your
Instagram I did a video on how to look
good in all your photos on Instagram and
you guys seem to love it so I thought I
would do more actually have another
video coming on I might Cermak start
making like an Instagram series because
I love Instagram and you guys like the
videos so today's video will be how to
grow your Instagram and let's get
started I know of course you want to
post everything you want to post but if
you're really trying to grow your
numbers what I would recommend is for
them maybe even just try it for a week
two weeks focus on really posting all
the things that brings you the most
commented likes now I realize that my
fashion photos and then my photos with
Noah tend to get the most likes
so I post a lot more outfit photos
recently and then me and Noah also make
sure to post pictures whenever we have
time to take photos as well number two
is utilizing the Instagram snap feature
now that's another way if you really
like posting photos that may not get a
lot of likes on your feed but other ones
do use the Instagram snap feature to
post those photos you know use the s-pen
a way to update your followers get them
to really love your personality and love
you and it's also going to make this
stick around and look for your stuff
another way to grow your Instagram is
using the live feature on Instagram now
I actually haven't done this very often
I need to take my own advice but they is
proven that if you go live on Instagram
you're more likely to be on the explore
page and being on the explore page will
bring you new people so try going live
maybe do a Q&amp;amp;A or something could be fun
maybe I should do that soon let me know
in the comments should I go live soon
maybe I'll do it next one is being
active and engaging on Instagram I
always notice that I gain the most
followers when I'm liking other people's
photos coming phaedra doing exclusive
blog on Instagram then try and comment
on more people that also do Cisco's
because maybe they'll notice you which
brings me to my next one
just trying to network or collaborate
now you can collaborate on Instagram
just like people do here on YouTube just
a little differently what you can do is
say you find another Ida fashion clothes
recently say I find another fashion
blogger who lives in my area we can meet
for coffee take a really cute back photo
together tag each other maybe make a new
friend and both of us can kind of show
each other on our own feeds you know
that a photo together which might bring
new followers of her and your followers
to me and like I said maybe you'll make
a new friend my next one is tagging
everything in your photo so what I like
to do is tag all the clothing clothing
clothes clothing items I'm wearing all
the brands everything like that because
it just it makes you show up in there
she tagged photos which can also make
people find your page it's also just a
way to spread your photos another thing
you can do is tag inspiration pages I
tagged tons of fashion inspiration pages
too on my photos in hopes that they will
repost them if you find your clothing
companies or food blogs or whatever
you're trying to do if you're doing
maybe your photographer maybe look for
like those photography sharing accounts
look for the accounts that share other
Instagram pages and try and tag them in
your post try and make posts that look
like they would want to repost them and
try and get reposted next to it are
hashtags I feel like a lot of people
don't use hashtags fit anymore but I
feel like you should too for my fashion
photo hashtag fashion bloggers fashion
style outfit of the day red hair
sometimes all tags what you don't do a
hashtag for the brand if they have like
a share me hashtag as well but yeah
holding all the hashtags is just another
way to get your name out there the next
one is trying to have somewhat of a
cohesive theme now I definitely don't
think you have to have a strict
Instagram theme I really don't yes that
is another one is trying to have
somewhat of a cohesive theme that way if
someone doesn't find you from your photo
they just look at your whole entire page
without having to look at your photo so
they're already like oh my gosh this
page looks so good it's very pleasing to
the eye I want to subscribe not
subscribe I want to follow them and
another one is sharing into your other
pages share your Instagram post to your
Twitter your Facebook think that might
be all them you can even share it onto
your snap
folks like a screenshot of your
Instagram I always share my post because
some people on Twitter may not follow me
on Instagram and say it same thing for
Facebook and those are just ways to
bring people to already follow you on
other things who already like you
anyways who may have just forgotten to
follow you to your Instagram as well
and every every number counts right
social media including my Instagram is
linked down below in my Twitter I love
you guys very much I hope you liked this
video if you did like I said give it a
thumbs up subscribe if you want to it
means a lot to me leaving comments down
below letting me know anything at all do
you like this video what are your tips
on growing your Instagram I will be
responding to comments and I will see
you all later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
