or welcome if you're in ooh I just had a
nosebleed so life is great today today's
video is going to be my version of how
to get a bikini body I am seeing these
videos everywhere and that is because
it's like swimsuit season and everyone
is doing those videos so I thought I
would tell you my tips and tricks on how
to get a bikini body number one is to
make a list of all the things that you
love about yourself and stand in the
mirror and repeat those things over and
over until you feel super duper
confident
number two is to stop watching any
videos that make you feel like you need
a specific body type to be in a swimsuit
because you don't it is bikini season
it's swimsuit season it is summer spring
whatever season and it's time to have
fun and hang out with your friends and
be out in the warm weather it is not
time to worry about what people think
about you in a swimsuit number three is
to love your body love the body that you
were given because it is your body and
nobody can take that away from you it is
your body love it because it's yours
which leads to my next point and while
you are loving your body and loving
yourself don't put down anybody else's
body as well there's nothing worse than
putting down someone else while you're
lifting yourself up so learn to accept
that all bodies are beautiful your body
is beautiful my body is beautiful her
body is beautiful her body is beautiful
your body is beautiful their bodies
beautiful all bodies are beautiful now
if you are trying to get healthy and you
want to lose weight then do that because
you want to do it because you want to
feel good about it not because someone
else says you need to have a specific
body type for a swimsuit because that is
not okay like not everyone has to look
the same we don't all need the same body
shape we don't all need the same body
type we don't need that
there is beauty in you know everyone
looking different everyone being
different that's beautiful and my next
thing is to pick out a swimsuit that
makes you feel so confident it does not
have to be a swimsuit that people say is
for your body type that is ridiculous
pick a swim so that you see on the
hanger that you're like wow I would look
good in that or wow I really want to
wear that I don't care what anyone
thinks and then put it on put the
swimsuit on and guess what you have a
bikini body if you're wearing a bikini
or a swimsuit you already have one whoa
we're all born with bikini bodies we're
all born with swimsuit bodies whoa what
you are you're beautiful you don't need
to look a certain way to wear a swimsuit
it's summertime go out and be confident
and have fun my biggest tip of all is to
go out and have fun and be confident so
the
when around you sees you and it's like
oh my gosh she's so confident she's
having fun I want to be confident and I
want to have fun and so they want to be
just like you cuz they want to be
positive and they want to live life and
love theirselves love yourself and
spread that around the world like some
beams coming out of your eyes you know
just be positive spread positivity in ya
again I'm not putting down any bikini
body videos I think everyone who makes
these videos has good intentions it's
just that they don't realize the title
how to get a bikini body and then
clicking on it and it's someone telling
you to do jumping jacks and eat fruits
and veggies like right before right
before summertime like they don't
realize that makes someone think like
that their body isn't good enough for a
swimsuit and your body is good enough
for a swimsuit all bodies are good
enough for a swimsuit do not miss out on
a fun summer or fun spring because you
are self-conscious do not let that
happen have a fun summer kick-ass slay
be confident be beautiful be you send me
pictures of yourselves in swimsuits and
I will tell you how hot you are and how
beautiful you are all the time I'm not
kidding if you guys want to post all of
your swimsuit selfies and tag me I will
comment on every single one of them no
joke go ahead sit him took me on
instagram instagram is linked down below
post them tag me let's get serious about
this there's nothing wrong with loving
yourself loving yourself is the best
thing you can possibly do and spreading
that love to other people is even better
I love you guys so much I hope you guys
take this video as it's supposed to be
positive and loved I'm not putting down
anyone's video I just want young girls
and anyone who's feeling bad about
themselves to feel good about themselves
