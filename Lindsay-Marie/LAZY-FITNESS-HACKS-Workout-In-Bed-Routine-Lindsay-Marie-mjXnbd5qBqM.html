you just don't want to get out of bed of
course you have because we've all had
them so today I'll be showing you like
10 workouts that you can do from your
bed now you can also probably do these
on your couch if you're a couch potato
instead of a bed potato make sure you
give this video a thumbs up and let's
get started first I'm gonna be doing
some knee lifts you just want to stack
one leg on top of the other and open and
close your knee this is really good for
your thighs and a really good warm-up
and perfect for watching TV on your bed
or the couch next you want to move on to
leg lifts this is basically just like
the knee lifts up except for you're now
moving the entire leg up and down this
is just adding a little bit more
movement into that one step next I just
like to move into a lower plank I hold
this probably during a commercial break
or something since I can't watch the TV
from my angle in my room next I'm going
to move in to bridges I just like to go
up and down and like a pulsing kind of
movement just to work my glutes and all
that good stuff moving on for some more
ab work I like to do flutter kicks which
is really great for your lower abs and
it's also perfect for working your hip
flexors as well leg raises are the
perfect abs and leg workout a lot of
people like to just bring their legs up
and down what you can do but I like to
bring my legs up in and out and then I
also like to reverse it that way I'm
working my full range of my abs and also
my legs and hello from my fuzzy a
brightly colored socks they clearly say
hello next like to move on to some
scissor kicks and then I like to go in
and do a reverse tabletop a leg lifts
which is where you just take turns
bending your knee and let's take it
straight up in the air this is perfect
working your entire legs and your butt
and these are super tiring but they are
super efficient as well now while you're
already in your reverse tabletop you
also want to do some fire hydrants you
just want to stay in your reverse
tabletop and bring your knee out to the
side make sure you're keeping your core
really tight while you do this so you're
still working your core
in to finish it off I like to cool down
with some side clink work now this was a
little hard to do on a bed you might
want to move to the floor just for this
one but you can make it work if you
really don't want to get off the bed I
mean I did now I am exhausted after that
I am seriously sweating so I'm not lying
I tell you that you can do a good
workout from the comfort of your own bed
okay guys so I hope you enjoyed my in
bed or on the couch workout routine this
is perfect for those lazy days and I
hope you enjoyed it if you did please

also I've been thinking about going
blonde is that a bad idea like just tell
me in the comments don't be rude please

don't want to go like hey help me ground
on the back grouchy I don't want to go
like platinum but I thought maybe doing
like the ball iaj highlights kind of
thing I really like Jessie James here

thinking about doing let me know in the
comments if I should try or just go for
it or find you should not go for it I
mean I've never had one here before but

rainbow so I mean why not I love you
