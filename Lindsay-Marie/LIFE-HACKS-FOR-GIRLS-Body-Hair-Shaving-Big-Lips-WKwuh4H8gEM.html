if you are new today's video is a life
hacks for girls because you might love
my last lot and I was like let's do
another one this one's gonna be based
all around like shading and body hair
because I thought that would be really
well because springtime and summertime
is here and funny here like first off if
you want you'll have you don't have to
shave throw if you want to let it out
let it out I'm all about doing what
makes you happy so please do not think I
am telling you in this videos that you
need two shades if you don't work April
don't shave
I however like two shades because you
don't like itchy young to be honest
because like yeah yeah so I tend to try
to get rid of my body hair it sometimes
get frustrating when you Nick yourself
and get right razor bumps or all that
stuff so I thought I would tell you all
the things I have learned for t-bet
shading and removing body hair hack
nowadays video it does have you
sponsorship by p.m. you kiss now I was
pretty excited about this because I
don't really do a lot of sponsorships if
you notice on my channel I don't really
do that many I know everyone really is
wanted by your lips it's a very much a
trend right now and I have like Angelina
Jolie or kind of their lips right now
enough okay but you think the only way
to get that is from lip injections lip
injections are expensive I personally
would never want to get lip injections
definitely I don't want to put needles
on my body I don't like needles PMD kiss
is basically like an at-home
this pumping device it basically uses a
smart technology to pulse it your wrists
in like bring blood flow to it so just
make them plumper in we're full
okay so I figure going to try it out on
camera so first we start with this PMD
kiss smart lip plumping serum so here's
the box inside that laughs so what often
says there are two treatment you can use
number one for a quick clump or number
two OC for more intense
target aslam so then I'm going to do it
number two so this is a device to be
here I'm doing like a little pulses and
I'm going to play on different sections
of my leg all these three on the bottom
three on the top and I'm going to do
with like ten folders on each section
all right I think it I give it an a-plus
because I say for a one-time affordable
price to have forever long lasting you
know plum lipstick just carry this
around my purse and do it like for two
minutes before my photo shoots it
literally took me about three minutes to
do my entire lip and I see a basic
France I'm very impressed
number wanted to clean up your wage with
baby oil you don't want to you don't
want to know I've turned old razors
practically it's a new ranges again I
thought like I couldn't use it because
of this just what's not afraid to risk
old dull and then I figured this out I
wipe it clean the baby oil so much hair
would come out and it was like a brand
new razor
it was really gross but it's kind of fun
to watch which is gross but should I
miss that but it's the truth number two
is you can use coconut oil finish
shaving cream and make sure like chilli
sauce coconut oil good for your leg so
it's smoothing your skin it's a lot
cheaper you can use just a little bit of
coconut oil rub down your legs and shave
it works just as well and then you're
like you're super baby smooth afterwards
number three is using milk and water for
razor bumps if you get the rash maybe
they're painful and they're all red and
swollen use a little bit of milk with
water rub it on this place we have the
razor box it will reduce the swelling or
do some writing it will help to soothe
the pain
another one is putting chapstick on your
razor cut so if you cut yourself while
you're shaving when you get out apply a
little bit of chapstick on to your
content Oh kind of like stop it from
bleeding it's kind of the same thing as
using me a sporran so you can also just
use me a spore if you had me a thorn but
I never buy any a sporran so I just grab
my chapstick and it stopped bleeding but
another thing if you want you can just
invest in nice board except that if you
change into slow straight slow straight
lines that you will avoid nicking
yourself completely so instead of just
kind of shading all over like from
acculturate this way over my knee and
this way and that way in this other way
shade and straight slow lines every
single time to string with the hair and
you should avoid all of those problems I
know I think it's using Maine phrases
like little log people know this but a
lot of girls use men's razors on their
life that one I don't recommend it does
using men raises
your legs because that hair you taste to
be softer cannot actually cause your
skin to be dry and cut more easily so
use men's razors all your bikini area
and your underarms it's going to give
you a much cleaner smoother shave to
last a little bit longer allow your skin
to soften in the water before you shave
or a better shave so get in the water
and do your shower your back stand there
can we 5 minutes first and then shave
instead of getting in a shower back and
shading first try and put it out the
last thing you do before you get out the
next one is life-saving for me have you
ever shaved your legs and then you got
out and like the very next day or maybe
if you are later you have a little bit
of stubble that is because you have dry
skin on your web so what you can do is
exfoliate your legs which is going to
take off layers of dry skin which will
reveal more hair and they shave so fully
before you shave now will you shave all
of it that way you don't have stubble
the next day now it's perfectly fine to
shave upwards on your legs to shave
against the hair because I should do the
square the shade however do not do this
on your bikini here area because that
causes irritation and those red razor
bumps that you couldn't commonly see so
instead of creating upwards on your
bikini area here you try shooting
downwards with the hair versus a Gibson
you might notice a lot less irritation
