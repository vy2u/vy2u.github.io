doing a fitness life hacks these are
gonna be life hacks for getting in shape
getting fit and just staying healthy now
if you want to see a beauty life hacks
to make sure to give this video a thumbs
up so I know to do that one next
also leave any comments down below and
without further ado let's go ahead and
get started if you're someone that
absolutely hates the workout then just
sleep in your workout clothes I know
that sounds like a crazy tip but
honestly sleep in your workout clothes
so that you wake up in the morning and
you really don't have an excuse because
you're already dressed and ready for
your workout because let's be honest do
you really want to change back into your
regular clothes and then back into your
workout clothes again later no you don't
so it saves you time this way to
actually just sleep in your workout
clothes and get it over with
all right now my second hack is a turn
that binge-watching into something
positive for your life
roll out a workout mat in front of your
TV and get the workouts in while you're
watching your shows that way you're now
killing two birds with one stone when
you're just about to kill Eve take your
last shot you know you're going to have
me on instagram then by now you know I
freaking love my organic valley organic
balance of protein shakes they are so
good for so many different reasons one
is because it's really good for your
muscles to drink a protein shake after
you workout and the other thing is you
can use them as a meal replacement when
you drink these you're gonna feel so
full for a really long time so you're
less likely to snack on something and
also they taste delicious so it's kind
of like rewarding yourself because it
feels like you're drinking a milkshake
or chocolate milk and by the way they
are having a really big promotion coupon
sale right now so I will leave that down
below if you want to discount okay now
we've all been that person that's in the
gym and doesn't really know what they're
doing and you don't want to be the
person that's looking around like um
what now so good thing to do is steal
someone else's workout my favorite thing
to do is go into bodybuilding calm where
you can type in like what kind of
workout you're looking for and then give
you a bunch of workouts that you can do
with or without equipment at home or in
the gym and then you kind of feel like
you're a bro just keep a gym bag packed
at all times because you never know when
you'll have some free time and then you
already have a backpack and ready to go
so you have no excuses and my next talk
is to actually keep some sort of
inspiration for yourself I like to do a
wills versus a won't I basically write
the reasons I will go to the gym and the
reasons I won't go to the gym and by the
end of writing that down I realized I
don't have any good excuses not to go to
the gym but I have tons of reasons to go
to the gym so they don't like to tape
that to my door or something for the
next week or so just to remind myself
every day that there are no reasons for
me not to go and there are millions of
reasons for me to go
my last mark is so simple it's just to
stand up more instead of sitting down I
find if I stand up while I'm on the
computer or reading I'm more likely to
add a little bit of a workout in there
instead of just sitting down and being
lazy thank you guys so much for watching
