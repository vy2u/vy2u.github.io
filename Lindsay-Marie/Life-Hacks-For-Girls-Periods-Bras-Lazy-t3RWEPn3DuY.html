we're welcome if you are new you are
looking for I today might I add today's
video is my girl life hacks for girls I
did this a while back and you guys
really liked it's one of my most popular
videos on my channel so I thought I
would do another one with more hacks
listening hacks and see what you guys
think
make sure give this video a big thumbs
up if you're excited for it and let's go
ahead okay so one thing I really hate
doing is redoing my hair that sounds
really bad I'm so lazy like won't I do
my hair I like to leave it like that for
as long as possible so you're someone
like me who doesn't like to reattach up
your hair especially even like
throughout the day hairspray is
definitely important thing so my
favorite hair spray green is definitely
rave actually bye it's like $2.97 at my
local grocery store or a drugstore or
wherever I like about is it does have
climate shield and climate shield is
really good to protect your hair from
humidity rain wind the thing is most
people don't know the differences
between different types of hair sprays
aerosol spray cans you have the pump or
spritzer cans so on the aerosol can that
is actually meant to give your hair lots
of body
lots of volume lots of texture and lots
of movement that's what's going to
really hold your hair exactly how it is
there is the spritzer like the pump
bottle that's pretty different that's
actually when you want like sleek
hairstyles if you want like no frizz you
want a super smooth hair you can
actually brush through you want to get
this spritzer bottle no technique I have
is a little like trick I like to do they
sound like the rave mini hair sprays
that are super cheap as the aerosol one
I like to keep that in my purse actually
so if I am going out throughout the day
and my hair is like naturally wavy or
something I can add a little bit of
hairspray scrunch it just a little bit
it's perfect for after the gym - and my
hair looks like I just freshly got on
the shower freshly washed it freshly
scrunched it freshly did all that
whatever I do definitely a good thing
that next one is all about boobs and how
to have bigger boobs or make your boobs
look better or bigger or whatever you
want to do with your testicles testicles
that sounds weird chest let's not that
whatever - it's too late I already said
it's too late can't take it back ok so I
actually heard about this product for my
friend Nicolette over on her channel is
like whoa whoa gotta try this gotta see
if this really works and it works
obviously aw girl actually has like
adjustment bands inside of the bra in
the front that you can adjust so that
makes it even tighter
your boobs culture together to give you
more cleavage closer together cleavage
higher lift it also has silicone grips
all throughout the bra that really holds
it in place what I think is really great
and also the straps can be moved around
you can wear it as a normal bra you can
change the straps to make it like you
know however you want you can strapless
and no matter what is literally going to
hold them in place and it's going to
make them like it's voluminous and big
and like as much cleavage as you you
know that you're not going to wash your
hair the next morning I never washed my
hair so that's something I know every
night a good thing to do is to use your
dry shampoo or whatever you're going to
use some people use baby powder some
people use face makeup like face powder
whatever you're planning to use put it
in your hair the night before now what I
like to do is just spray my dry shampoo
into my roots or put a little baby
powder in there
I don't rub it out I don't like you know
brush it out I just put it in my roots
go to sleep wake up the next morning and
I kind of brush out my hair with my
fingers I mean hair looks super clean it
kind of just like absorbs the oil while
you sleep it makes it look a lot cleaner
and a lot fresher and a lot more
voluminous the next morning and saves
you like that extra two minutes of time
in the morning which I need those two
minutes to sleep I need them so I'm
definitely not a makeup artist but I
like to put on my makeup just like every
girl and I like just because I'm on
YouTube and I see these girls who have
Barham makeup I like to look as close as
possible I'm not really there yet but I
like to like I said I do lazy not like a
pro so I did find a really good trick
when I'm putting on lipstick because
when I put on lipstick before it be on
my teeth and be all over my nose the tip
of the liquid lipstick is super thin
what I like to do is take the tip of the
lipstick outline my lips really really
really slowly thick which is a lot
easier to be precise in with a big thick
regular lipstick and then just fill in
my lips afterwards look so much better
looks like I might actually know what
I'm doing
it's not all over my face it's not all
over my fingers it's just on my lips
okay so let's necklace just like a win
for win situation because when you're on
your period is it just me or it's not
just me are you craving some chocolate I
want to get on my period I'm craving
chocolate but when you're on your period
like you extra extra crave some
chocolate it's okay listen to your body
but try and get dark chocolate instead
because it does contain magnesium and
magnesium is really good for helping
cramps and it also helps you get energy
so it's really perfect it's like a win
for one okay now this next one is really
weird but let me just tell you so I was
actually watching a shame
Dawson video this is where I found this
one let me just be completely honest
with you here's someone who doesn't
really want to touch up your makeup in
the day this girl I am so lazy once I
put on my makeup in the morning I'm not
touching it for the rest of day I don't
bring makeup with me I don't got time
for that and the worst thing is when you
go outside you're sweating and you're
moving around like say you know half
your makeup is gone half is on my hand
or like on Noah's shirt or something
about hugging so apparently if you use
deodorant put it just like you would on
your underarms when you're sweating and
moving around a lot if you put a little
bit of the odor on your face like a
primer is going to cause your face to be
very smooth filling your pores like a
primer but also is going to help your
face with sweating and like movement and
so when you're sweating and adding like
oils on your face it's going to hold
them in like a huge like red carpet
secret and I've been doing it since then
and like what okay so I hope you guys
