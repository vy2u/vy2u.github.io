welcome back to my channel today's video
is gonna be all about how to make your
life positive and more happy and all
that good stuff
today's videos also a clap with my good
friend Lena she is a new youtuber hey
guys I'm Melana and on my channel we're
going to be doing it beauty hacks to
make sure you guys go check that out as
well I've all four links down below so
make sure to go ahead and check her out
and also today's video was inspired by
pretzel maker on April 26 which is
national pretzel day you can receive a
free pretzel from pretzel maker all you
have to do is post a positive thought on
your social media with the hashtag warm
thoughts take that and show it to
someone at a pretzel maker location and
you are gonna get a free pretzel now I
love that because what's better than
spreading positive vibes out to the
world and getting something back for it
it kind of shows you when you do
something good you get good back right
that's like good karma and so who
doesn't like so I believe that kind of
inspired by a video for today all about
positivity and keeping your life
positive so yeah make sure to use the
hashtag warm thoughts if you guys want
to see it receive a free pretzel and now
I'm gonna tell you all the ways to make
your life positive in film with the
world oz yeah number one is to make
yourself a happy place know if you guys
want to see a DIY happy place let me
know in the comments and I can do that
really soon basically you wanna have
somewhere you can go whenever you're
feeling down stressed depressed anxious
somewhere that makes you feel happy now
you can make this however you want to be
a corner in your room fill it with
things that make you happy I got a bunch
of crystals I got mine on Etsy from
Leslie and James amazing crystals I'll
have their Etsy shop down below I love
them so I have all my crystals I have
myself love books I have some candles I
have you know whenever I go in there I
take my phone I plug up some music or
all and in my happy place I'll meditate
I'll read my book it's a place where
when I'm feeling bad when I go into my
happy place I know like none of my bad
thoughts are allowed in that space
number two is going to be to surround
yourself with positive things like
putting quotes in your house that will
uplift your spirits or easily having
your phone lockscreen
be positive as well so you can basically
look at it every day and also another
thing is to read a positive books
because those also help out just keep
them everywhere just so you always see
it exactly number three is to nourish
your body when you feel good you're
gonna do good and when you do good
you're gonna feel good so eat healthy
foods drink lots of water and also
you
things that you love as well that's also
kelpy helping keep your body nourished
but don't over indulge in things so that
way when you're getting like to eat a
slice of cake you're really really like
appreciating it and that your body is
still feeling good so nourish your body
and that's gonna help you nourish your
mind as well but number four is going to
be spend more money on experiences like
traveling and all that kind of good
stuff
that way you are surrounding yourself
with happy and positive thoughts and not
just on material items my favorite one
number five is cutting out negative
people from your life now I'm not saying
if your friend has a bad day that you're
like hey we're not friends anymore I'm
talking about the people that are
constantly putting you down constantly
negative they're always in a bad mood
those kind of people it's better to
separate yourself or just give yourself
some space to get away from them leaning
on to the next one you need to surround
yourself with the kind of people that
you also want to be exactly like if you
want to be a positive uplifted person
and surround yourself with positive
uplifting people exactly so the next one
is to keep a journal it's really great
when you're having a bad day or having a
good moment to write that down write
down how you're feeling keep it out on
paper so you can really go back and look
at it because typically if I'm having a
bad day and I write down like what's
bothering me I'll look at it on paper
and realize it's really not that big of
a deal and then if I'm having a good day
what I'm having a bad day and go back
and relook at a good moment and be like
oh wow that a good moment makes me feel
a lot better than the bad moment so onto
number eight you need to learn to be in
the moment so that's actually something
I really struggle with a lot I'm really
trying to work on because typically if
you focus too much on the past you're
gonna be depressed but if you focus too
much on the future you're gonna become
anxious so what you want to do is learn
to be in the present moment so that way
you are being gracious and like grateful
and just happy with what's going on
right now so moving on to number 10 you
need to appreciate others like you are
going to appreciate yourself so what
we're saying by that is all the time
I'll notice myself saying something like
oh my gosh of course this girl has this
many views on a video of course this
girl has this many subscribers because
she's awesome or cuz she's pretty we
should be saying those things about
ourselves like the way you look at a
girl that you look up to look at
yourself like that think of yourself
like oh my gosh of course I got this
because I'm awesome of course I got this
because I'm beautiful you should be
saying those things about yourself and
not just other people totally agree fat
