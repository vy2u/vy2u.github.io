channel today's video is my spring
morning routine for 2016 pretty excited
for my first morning routine video in
2016
hey anyway so when I first wake up I
will typically love on my dog grab my
phone that I put across my bed on the
other side of the table so that way I
have to move around a little bit
I will stretch check my notifications
and then get out of bed now yes I am
wearing a pink onesie in this video get
over it now once I get out of bed I will
immediately make my bed because if not I
will never make it and I never make it I
mean I will never make it so I have to
make it first thing in the morning that
way I'm not like tempted to get right
back in bed and it makes me feel a
little bit more like I don't know makes
you feel more productive for the day if
that makes sense now once my bed is
fully made it's time for me to break out
into my happy dance
no I'm honestly I'm just kidding after I
make my bed I will probably just lay
back down all my bed and check my phone
for a little bit just because I've just
woken up but I'm still pretty tired and
then this you know I'm getting out of my
grouchy mood now it is time for me to
brush my teeth and yes everyone always
asked me yes I like to brush my teeth
before I eat breakfast I don't know
something about eating a yummy breakfast
with like nasty germs in my mouth just
like freaks me out so I have to brush my
teeth beforehand now it is time for me
to head to the kitchen and make up some
food
now for my breakfast this morning I
first learned off by making a cup of
green tea typically I'll make coffee but
I was out so green tea had to do now
also I decided to make a fruit smoothie
I just used a banana some frozen
blueberries some almond milk a little
bit of peanut butter and some ice
blended that up my nutribullet and I was
good to go and then I also decided you
know some days you want to be healthy
and some days you don't want to be
healthy so I decided to make two waffles
this morning and yes I added butter and
yes I added a lot of syrup now while I
eat my breakfast and drink my smoothie I
like to have a little bit of like a me
time and during this time I'll typically
read some of my book I've been reading
big magic by Elizabeth Gilbert and that
is incredible now I will also write in
my planner just to make sure I'm super
organized I know everything I'm doing
for the day I don't know why but I my
planners help me get this so organized
and like on schedule and on task but
every single day like throughout the
year I definitely recommend getting a
planner for someone who likes to stay
organized and you have a lot to do
throughout the day now once I'm finished
with my breakfast I will spend about
five minutes cleaning up the house and
cleaning up anything that I just need to
clean up obviously and then it is time
for my favorite part of the morning and
that is my workout so this morning I was
actually getting my new fabletics so I
was super excited to put these on
because they just came in I really like
fat lytx because they send you like full
complete outfits and you not only can
like wherever you work out but I also
wear them like for running errands
because they're like freaking cute and
really flattering they're also just
really good quality material it's like
really awesome prices if you look at the
prices compared to like like the VIP
membership subversives like the actual
prices you would be like you're like in
shock like oh my gosh you're getting
such a good deal not to mention when you
sign up as a VIP that your first like
outfit for like $25 $25 if you haven't
talked I'd like so I definitely
recommend them like I said when I have a
new like Q workout clothes it really
motivates me to get healthy and like
stay
so the fact that I get a new outfit
every single month it fits me like super
motivated all the time and you just see
how cute these are so now this time
before my workout oh by the way the one
I'm wearing right now is the splatter
print now I work out to bury all the
time this morning I did a little bit of
everything I did some cardio I did some
yoga I did some random stuff if you like
me and do a full workout routine or let
me know I do also have a diet and
exercise routine that I can link it down
below as well but yeah I will just get
my morning workout in in my cute
fabletics and I also took like a million
selfies in these you haven't seen the
one Instagram
share come out I hope it links to
fabletics down below and Sarah whooping
also put links to all my workout videos
down below as well and again if you want
to see a more workout videos let me know
because I haven't done one in a while
and I can do that so now that I'm always
in doubt shaky and sweaty is time before
at my morning shower now I did have to
switch all of my hair products recently
because like you know if you didn't know
already
I did get keratin fusion extensions
meaning I have like hair glued into my
head so I had to switch all of my hair
products and I did switch them to HSI
which is like a really healthy like
sulfate free like natural really good
brand a lot of you had recommended it to
me so yeah I am using HSI products for
all of my hair stuff now and then here
is just an overview of everything I use
in the shower
now once I get out I do have a little
bit of an expensive hair care routine
just because like I said these
extensions I want them to laugh and
really like be good so I'm using my HS s
HS I blow dryer in my HS i thermal
protectant spray and I'm going to
blow-dry all the extensions first using
the paddle brush that is also from HS I
just going to brush my hair I'll make
sure it's super tangle free and then
blow-dry it with the blow-dryer by the
way this flow dryer is insanely fast and
makes my hair blow-dried in like
literally like two minutes three minutes
super fast and once I am done a blow
drying all of my extensions I will take
the round brush that I also have from
HSI and I will round brush up my top of
my hair which is my natural hair it's
not fake that way I can get more in
there and like get some more volume and
give my hair a little bit more room for
the day and last but not least I will
take the HSI leave-in argan oil and I
will put this through my like the ends
of my hair just to keep my hair super
extra soft and shiny throughout the day
then it is time for me to go ahead and
get dressed I decided to keep it pretty
casual today and just throw on some
comfy jeans and a t-shirt because I
wasn't doing very much and then it's
time for me to go ahead and put on my
makeup here's an overview of all the
products I use it pretty much changes
every single day and it really varies I
literally just throw on makeup every day
I have no idea what I'm doing so once I
finish putting up my makeup on I will
now get to work and that is time for my
afternoon stuff what I do in the
afternoon changes almost every single
day for work sometimes I film video
sometimes I edit sometimes I have
meetings sometimes I have photoshoots it
really depends on my day so if you'd
like to see an afternoon routine let me
know in the comments because I've never
done one of those and I don't know if
anyone really does those but I could
definitely do it also make sure to give
