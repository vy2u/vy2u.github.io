my channel first off let me tell you you
girl has strep throat so I'm sorry if I
sound really crazy but first thing in
the morning Noah tends to wake up pretty
early cuz he has class I like 8:00 a.m.
Monday through Friday so he tends to get
up at like 6:30 or 7:00 and he does his
stuff and he always sits my phone next
to me for my alarm but let's be serious
I hit snooze like five to ten times
because I live in Ohio and guys it is so
cold outside and my bed is so warm so
eventually after hitting snooze a few
times I woken up around like 8:30 9:00
and then of course I have to love on my
cute AF puppy like you see how cute he
is he's adorable
uh-huh and then I try to always meditate
in the mornings because I have a severe
anxiety to be honest so meditating in
the morning really helps me I use tons
of like free apps and free online
meditations trust me you do not have to
pay to meditate there are so many free
resources online I can link some down
below but yes meditating has changed my
life and then of course I have to do one
more belly rub with rooster cuz he is so
freaking cute and then I will eventually
get out of bed and I tend to make my bed
almost every morning I'm definitely a
messy person but I do like to make my
bed just because I don't know it
I don't know cuz it's so easy first off
my bed stuff is just super easy
and look how cute rooster was like
looking out the window I tried to catch
it but of course he noticed me and he
stopped but time to go in and do the
usual like I always have to pee like 10
gallons in the morning and of course I
brush my teeth and then I head on to the
living room the first thing I do is feed
rooster cuz I'm sure he is a hungry boy
and rooster has to come first and yes we
do walk rooster like multiple times
during the day I also walked him while
was filming this I just decided not to
film it and then literally a while I was
filming this Noah came in with breakfast
this is real life I mean I made him go
back out and read come in for the video
but he brought us Starbucks and
breakfast I was just about to make
healthy smoothies but hey when the
fiance comes in with greasy breakfast
sandwiches and Starbucks you don't say
no so then we decided to sit together
and eat our breakfast and drink our
coffee which was really fun and we
talked all about his morning and here's
Noah almost choking on a Tater Tot so
you know it's casual and it wouldn't be
following ya'll without some fog candles
so I love to light a fall candle in the
morning so it gets all cozy and of
course turn on the fireplace because
it's cold and then because we were
watching TV while we're eating bad habit
I know we decided to sit down and finish
our coffee and finish episode of
freakish beer watching
and then because rooster has so much
energy we always have to play with him
like a million times every hour which is
not a complaint because he's so cute but
yeah we always make sure to play with
him a million times every day so that he
has all his energy out
and then it's time to continue on with
our day Noah tends to do all of his
homework in the morning when he gets
home from class so while he starts his
homework I decided to go ahead and start
getting ready for the day now first I go
ahead and get in my shower and I did not
wash my hair but you guys are always
asking for the products I use so I
thought I would show you anyways and
then I just get out wash my face with
this glam glow super cleanse face wash
really good for acne really helping my
skin moisturize and then go in and do my
makeup now I'm not a makeup artist so
this is just like the everyday stuff I
do I mean I can always do an everyday
makeup routine if you want it but again
I'm not a makeup artist
and it would not be a complete morning
without getting mascara on my eyelid
literally never failed now on to my hair
I recently got tape and extensions I
will make a video on them really soon
but I just braided my hair the night
before so that they'd be nice and waved
in the morning but then I just go in and
use my curling iron and curl like one to
two pieces on each side just to fix any
pieces that didn't really get curled or
maybe I laid on like too much at night
you know I'm saying if they're like mess
up or something
and then I move on to all of my computer
stuff so just responding to any emails
YouTube comments editing videos anything
like that and then on my fridge I keep
this cute little list of everything I
want to do every day to be positive you
can call it cheesy all you want that's
okay but hey it really works for me and
then I just keep a whiteboard right next
to it to write down my daily list of
things I need to do every single day and
then because I'd like to stay in my PJs
as long as humanly possible I will
finally get dressed my sweater and jeans
are from romwe and my shoes are from zoo
shoe I love this outfit super cozy and
cute and then because it's fall and it
would not be fall without sneezing and
allergies I've got to do my flonase and
I'm sure this is really attractive and
I'm sure you guys totally wanted to see
it but hey it's fall ya'll guys I hope
you enjoyed my morning routine a for
fall I hope you loved it I loved filming
it make sure to do this one like very
realistic so I feel like you guys would
appreciate that if it was like a
realistic morning routine make sure you
are subscribed turn on those
notifications so you never miss an
upload cuz a lot of you guys aren't
missing uploads I'm not sure if you know
that but if you don't have notifications
the algorithm is wack right now so make
sure how those notifications on so you
don't miss my videos and now for the
giveaway so if you saw the shoes I was
wearing in my outfit today those were
from zushio and they were nice enough to
tell me that they would give away a pair
of shoes to one of my subscribers your

details down below so make sure to check
that out and yeah I love you guys so so
