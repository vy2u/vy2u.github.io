or welcome if you are new today's video
is going to be my shower routine and I
was going to say you guys requested this
but I don't know if you actually did but
I thought I would do one anyways because
I thought it would be a good way to
answer lots of questions you guys have
had about my hair mainly my skin and
lots of other things like that so yeah
so when it comes to my shower routine I
tend to like the shower or wash my body
mainly every day now I will be honest
just like every human hopefully every
human it may just be me I do have lazy
days occasionally where I don't end up
showering but I probably should have
told you that but for the most part I
for the most part I do wash my body
every day however my hair I tend to only
wash it like twice a week so for my
shower routine the very first thing I do
is turn my water on as cold as I can
handle it and then I jump straight into
the water and I go ahead and rinse my
hair because I do have to wash my hair
in cold water to keep the color that is
actually my best tip to keep color
lasting as long as possible is to wash
it in cold water
so I get in immediately with the water
cold and I wash my hair using my caviar
anti-aging color whole shampoo now like
I said I only washed my hair like twice
a week so if I am NOT washing my hair
obviously I am NOT putting my mind the
water on cold I'm just gonna skip this
step but when I'm washing my hair this
is what I do and then once I've rinsed
out my shampoo I will turn the water
back to warm because I've not taken a
freezing cold shower the entire time and
then I will move on to my conditioner
now when it comes to my conditioner I
have two different ones and I just like
to alternate in between a regular
conditioner and then a like conditioning
mask because I would you call them yes
so this one is just the caviar infinite
color hold conditioner that matches my
shampoo and I will alternate this one
along with this one which is the
proclaim argan oil it was just a deep
hydrating mask I got this from Sally's I
don't remember how much it was but I'm
pretty sure they still have it it's a
huge container it's lasted me a good
while and then once I put in my
conditioner I will let my conditioners
in my hair the entire time to the rest
of my shower so while my conditioner is
sitting I will move on to first my body
wash and the body wash I am currently
using is just from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
this is the country apple shower gel it
just smells really good I just got it
cuz it smells good I don't know so once
I've done that I will then move on to
shaving my legs or any of my body hair
that I don't want to talk about to you
guys I just use a Gillette Venus razor
Angela Venus shaving cream pretty simple
pretty standard shave and everything it
was actually really funny cuz I tried to
like stand up and shave for the video
and I slipped and fell like three times
actually it wasn't funny at the time it
was pretty dangerous and very scary so I
ended up having to just like do my
normal thing and sit down but yeah I was
just like trying I was like struggling
so hard to shave my legs for the video
then I will move on to washing my face
and my face wash tends a change pretty
frequently just because I've always
trying new things to be honest right now
I have been using the glam glow super
cleanse and I will say this has been my
favorite face wash I have ever used my
skin is pretty clear most of the month
but when it's time for like that time of
the month
my skin does tend to break out some
however while I've been using this it is
currently at that time of the month it's
actually the end of that time of the
month for me I didn't get like a single
breakout I do think this face wash has
had a very big hand and very very clear
skin from this month so I don't know if
I will ever be switching back to another
face wash and then once I have done all
of that stuff I will turn up my hot
water or warm water back to cold and
rinse out my conditioner and that is all
I do I get out of shower and then when I
got the shower I do tend to put on some
body lotion I just use like an equate
cocoa butter one it was cheap it was
like two bucks I don't know I got it at
Kroger I'm so nothing like too fancy for
that I do tend to moisturize especially
because it's winter and my skin is
getting a really drying recently but
that's like ant for my shower routine I
