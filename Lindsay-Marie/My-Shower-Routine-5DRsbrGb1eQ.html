today's video is my shower routine
basically I'm just going to be showing
you all the products that I like to use
on a day-to-day basis in the shower as
well as a products I like to use on a
weekly basis when I like to pamper
myself just a little bit more than usual
first English hour I like to wash my
hair and I just got my new profile Pro
which is a customized shampoo and
conditioner basically on their website
you can just pick the type of thing you
want out of your shampoo conditioner
like what your main concern is like
volume moisture and stuff like that you
get to pick your main focus then you
also get to choose your name or your
nickname to put on your bottles as well
as your custom sink really cool idea I
love this because know everyone's here
is different and everyone needs
different things so I like to start off
by using my custom Pro Lindsey shampoo
and lathering up in my hair it goes nice
and clean and then rinse it out now
moving on to my Lindsey conditioner such
a cool thing I actually chose the
coconut scent I love coconut for my
conditioner I just like to focus it on
the shaft of my hair all the way down to
the ends just to make sure my hair is
nice and smooth but not really on my
roots and then I rinse this out after 2
or 3 minutes next I'm just using my
shower gel from zest it is called fruit
boost is easily my favorite I have in 3
different since because they all smell
delicious it does come in three
different ones and I love the packaging
because it is super super colorful but I
love the shower gel because it leaves me
feeling super super clean feeling really
fresh and also smelling super fruity so
I definitely definitely recommend at
this shower gel if you are looking for a
new one and you can get it at Walmart
and it's easily my favorite I just like
to use my Moroccan hammond black soap to
exfoliate I just put this on and then I
used my orange myth to exfoliate then I
use my Moroccan hammond rasool which is
a brown paste and I put all over my body
and let it sit for a few minutes and
then you rinse it off but obviously I
have a little bit too much fun when I
put this stuff on because it is a bit
messy but it makes my skin feel so soft
so get a girl and then well we all know
what this looks like so my girl
welcome now it's time to rinse it off
and I had a really fun experience of
rinsing it off and getting a mascara all
in my eye don't tell me don't make this
face with this happens we all do
nice this is time to wash my face with
my Pacifica kale detoxing it cleanser I
love this stuff and again I just need to
calm down girl what are you doing now is
this time to shave my legs and that is
it so that is my shower routine I just
get out and I put some moisturizer on I
put on some body lotion and brush my
teeth and then I use my Moroccan hey mom
argan oil to put a little bit in my hair
keep my hair nice and soft throughout
the day and that is it for my shower
routine alright guys so that was my
shower routine basically that's just
everything that I use on a daily basis
in the shower when I'm scrubbing Govan
and also it's a few products that I use
like once a week just to pamper myself
just a little bit because we all deserve
to be pampered in my right ladies in my
right and gentlemen if you're a guy
watching you deserve to be pampered as
well okay guys so basically this is just
my shower routine I hope you guys
