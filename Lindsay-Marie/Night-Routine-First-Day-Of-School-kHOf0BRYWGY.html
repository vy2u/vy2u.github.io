doing my first day of school night
routine and this is kind of to try and
help you not be so stressed out the
night before the first day of school
because let me be real with you I cry
every single night before going back to
school every single year the night
before school I bawled my eyes out
because I'm nervous I'm stressed out I'm
unorganized I don't know what to do I
like go through like this anxiety attack
going back to school and I would cry
this is just going to be all the things
that I would like to do that I should
start doing to prepare myself for the
night before going back to school so
that way you're organized you're
prepared everything is prepped and ready
to go so you're not stressed out you
know you can sleep without freaking out
or like staying up all night worried you
can't wake up in the morning feeling
ready to go and ready to like slay at
your school let's do this so if you guys
want to see how I would get ready for
the first day of school the night before
and let's go ahead and get started first
I started off by planning out my
back-to-school goals I always like to
plan out all my goals for the school
year the night before things like
getting good grades or you know staying
in shape or meeting new friends just so
I feel like I'm on track and I'm ready
to go for the school year
then I also like to go ahead and pack my
stuff I just pack all of my school
supplies into my book bag I sort of make
a checklist to make sure I have
everything that way I'm not stressed
about it the morning before and then
after I've got all my school supplies
packed it's time to go ahead and make my
lunch except for if I have something
like a sandwich I'm making but I'll pack
everything else like my snacks with a or
my chips and everything like that just
so I'm mainly ready to go in the morning
next I will pick out my outfit that's
really important to do the night before
if not you'll be freaking out so I just
go ahead and figure out exactly what I'm
wearing so that way I have have no
reason to stress in the morning I know
that I'm gonna be cute and ready to go
and I'll take me a lot less time to
struggle and kill my gloves in the
morning next I like to pay for myself
just a little bit so I'm going to start
off by painting my nails I always like
to pay my nails before some sort of
important event in the first day of
school is definitely an important event
then I decided it was time to go to the
gym I still like to go to gym at least
four to five times a week so I still
decided to go even though it's night
before school because that way I'll feel
like I did something super productive
still before school and I still got all
of my stuff done
then when I come back home I went ahead
and got dinner on the way back and I
also got some Starbucks now I'm going to
go ahead and wash my face I am a hot
mess after my workout so I'm washing my
face with my labo cleansing oil
something like that and then I'm going
in with my derma e two-in-one purifying
face mask so I'm putting on the face
mask and I'll probably leave this on for
like 10 to 15 minutes just until it
fully dries and the best thing about
this is it's a two and one so after it
dries I can also use it as an exfoliator
and that way my skin is super clean and
exfoliated for the day before school so
while this is drying I like to sit on my
computer obviously finish my Starbucks
plays my dog sit on Facebook YouTube all
the good stuff catch up with my friends
before the day before school ask
everyone there schedule all of that good
stuff and now it's time to exfoliate
with the same @ face mask I just add
some water to it and then I exfoliate my
skin this feels so good that's easily my
favorite part
oh it is shower time but also in the
shower I also did a hair mask so my hair
supersoft for the first day bag the last
thing I like to do to prep is whiten my
teeth I use my smile brilliant teeth
whitening and this is perfect because
it's a custom-made tray so it perfectly
fits to your teeth and was using the
whitening gel putting it into the trays
and leaving them on for about an hour
and a half you can leave them on from 30
minutes up to it's three hours but I
chose an hour and a half just because I
was pressed for time with school the
next day um my teeth feels so great
after this and I just feel like I'm so
much more confident when I whitened my
teeth so this is definitely a must for
me before the night before school and
then afterwards I will just sit on my
phone until I am tired enough to go to
bed talk to all my friends and then it's
time to hit the hay and I will see you
guys in the morning
alright guys so I hope you enjoyed that
if you did let's give this video a
thumbs up the more thumbs up the better
let's try and get this to at least 700
thumbs up do you want me to do a first
day of school morning routine with this
I can totally do that so I really hope
this helped you not feel as nervous or
stressed out for school because it's
really not a big deal I promise
everyone is just as nervous as you are
so hopefully this helps you be a little
bit more prepped and ready to go so you
can be worryfree and just ready to slay
the day alright I love you guys so much
