welcome if you are new today's video is
my pamper routine and I feel like this
is a great video because we all deserve
to pamper ourselves and take care of
ourselves nourish our bodies and our
souls and our spirits and our minds and
our hair and our faces and our skin
I love camper days I love lazy days I
love days where I just do whatever I
want to do and I just kind of hang out I
think those things days are really good
for you mentally and physically mood
basically yeah that's still good for you
physically so I thought I would share
with you all the things that I like to
do on a pamper routine day or like an
at-home spa day and all that good stuff
okay so for my paper route changes so
many things that I like to do and really
is it I have to start off with setting
the mood in my room so I like to light
candles I like to decide do I want to
make my bed or not make my bed I mean if
you like being a clean room feel free to
make your bed and do your dishes in the
morning before you're paying for routine
day if you don't care about those things
don't care about them that day I
typically always say I'm feeling right
now if I typically will not make my bed
I will just lounge around I'll light a
candle I'll put some like nice oils in
the air and that's how I like to set the
mood sometimes I will have a movie
playing in the background or some nice
music cuz whatever get you in that right
mindset it obviously comes eclose are
unless there are no jeans allowed on
paper days I like to put on my comfiest
sweats in a t-shirt no bra and that's it
sometimes it is cooler out always some
fuzzy socks that's pretty much all I'm
wearing on a pampered a those next one
may seem basic and cliche AF I do not
care on a pampered a I'm getting myself
some Starbucks so usually I would say if
you don't leave your house on paper day
don't leave your house but I love my
Starbucks okay next is my aromatherapy I
love aromatherapy some people think that
it's goofy so people don't understand it
I don't care I like it
I had tons of aromatherapy oils actually
not time to have like six of them but I
got buy-in from jose de actually I found
them online but whatever aromatherapy
oils you have that you like I just like
to sprint into my hand
and then take a few and deep breath
sometimes I'll do like five or six and I
just fail to feel that with the oils
that I use it instantly changes my mood
I also am definitely a firm believer and
meditation I love meditating it's such a
good way to clear your mind so I'm also
going to make sure that I meditate on a
day in I'm pampering myself just like I
do most days out of the time now I'm
definitely not perfect I forget to
meditate all the time
what on paper day I'm like okay I need
to have a clear mind no anxiety no
stress let's do this pose a couple
making out in their parking lot oh
goodness
they are really going at it down there
it's a little awkward
hey guys a book and read it spend an
hour just getting lost in a book or
spend ten minutes in read when you want
to read you know if you don't if you
hate reading that's okay I think reading
is so great for your mind it helps you
be more creative and helps you learn and
help you be or just fuels your brain I
think I love reading
I've always loved reading so I
definitely will love to like lounge and
read a book for sometimes like an hour
or two on any type of relaxing day now
we're getting down to the actual spa
stop and the at-home spa day stuff book
the best part of the day now the video
is in partnership with NAT this is the
NAD sensitive hair removal cream and I
thought what better video to put this in
then my pamper routine and I thought I
would go ahead and try it out now
getting this is the Naza sensitive hair
removal cream you use this on your legs
in your body to remove body hair now
this is supposed to remove your body
hair with it in about four of minutes
and I got to tell you I was a little
skeptical because I've tried hair rebels
before and I didn't love them but this
one I love so first off I put this on my
legs I just moved it over perfect for
using in the shower it was not messy it
did not drip it just went straight onto
my leg like a sick lotion and then I
timer for four minutes in a thirty
seconds
and then at the end of the time I texted
it to see if my hair was coming off and
it wiped away like butter or something
so I
my legs with a cloth and my legs were
completely smooth and I actually did
that about three days ago I'm actually
refilling the talking clip to this video
but this is about three days ago and my
legs are still super smooth it was not
painful that was my favorite part you
can actually find this at Target Ulta
and some drug stores or pharmacies I saw
it at Target for $4.99 and this is Emad
since of hair removal creams you love
super smooth skin it works on even the
shortest hairs got pretty short and like
Harriet took all that off I recommend
this for you I love doing face masks I
had the glam glow ones right now but
honestly it's just because like they
sent me a lot of them in a PR package
but I also love tons of em that I get at
the drugstore i camera what it's called
is he's really big like to blondes they
sell the drugstore like 2 bucks and
those are great if you want like an
affordable base back but I love cleaning
my skin I get really dry skin so I have
to use usually an exfoliating face mask
or a hydrating one depending on how my
skin is acting that day and I've also
been whitening my teeth lately I've been
using the whitening lightening Darlow
smile a smile kit a lot of people
recommended it to me so I thought I
would try it out and I actually don't
use the trays I don't know why but I
cannot use whitening trays to save my
life I when I do it I feel like I'm just
like swallowing the teeth whitening
stuff and it drives me crazy so I'm
actually using the dial-up smile like
teeth whitening pen I do those on paper
days but I also will do that for
political week straight whenever I'm
whitening my teeth next are painting my
nails now the color of an using rate
recently is the color sensations and so
dope you guys have been asking me about
it a lot because this would be the same
color on my nails for like a month I've
no longer using acrylics because I've
realized acrylics were killing my nails
and I don't really care too much about
acrylics like acrylics are cute yes oh I
do like acrylics it's just that my nails
are very spin and it just made them
really bad and it was that even a lady
the nail salon was like yeah your nails
are to say and for acrylics just don't
worry about it
so I'm happier just not using acrylics
and again I use the color sensational
SoDo but it's a lot cheaper than
acrylics as well they like to do a hair
mask because
is dry girl I've been using this in it
life hair mask now I love this hair mask
because you don't have to rinse it out
right away you don't have to use it in
the shower which I love I love hair mask
that you leave in for like a while
because I feel like it just does more
that you like it I used it a few times I
definitely feel like my hair is felt
really soft it's brushed out a lot
easier felt more manageable class
without these lush fast I can have a
paper day without a ha pass at the end
of the night now I love all lunchbox
bombs I love all bath bomb season at the
end of the night I will run a hot bath a
hot bath I will play some music lightly
I'll bring in my candle offering in a
cold drink for when I get too hot and
damn don't want to get out I'll bring in
a book or something like that I need to
get one of those trays so you can like
watch a movie in the bathtub but I
always forget to buy them because I feel
like I keep out basically but I do want
to get one eventually but I'll pop in my
favorite lush bath bomb and I will relax
in there for 30 minutes or when I'm
ready to get out and then I'm going to
feel so calm I'm ready to go to bed and
I'm ready to face the rest of the week
