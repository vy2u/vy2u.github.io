whenever you are horses hopefully I
shaved my underarms before I found this
today's video is my pamper routine
because I think it is so important to
take time off sometime and give yourself
rice Bend watch TV some people are so
against Bend watching
girl I am a fan obviously I think you
should bend watch every single day but I
think it is a good thing to sometimes
just sit back watch some TV have a day
to yourself do whatever you want
and that's what I'm doing today we're
just got myself a cup of coffee and then
I have a cut-up Kiwi some yogurt that I
forgot to get a spoon for we'll have to
fix that and I also got a bagel
then I've got a cute little puppy to my
run and a cute little puppy behind me
and while I'm eating this I am going to
watch some Vampire Diaries
okay so now I'm going to do a face mask
because those are super important for a
pamper routine day in my opinion so this
is the bubble and beau skin perfecting
miracle mask this is a reusable face
mask that you can use up to 20 times all
paraben free vegan all-natural
gluten-free and cruelty free so right at
my alley and you put your face serum on
to this well essentially can use serums
or face masks this is what I'm gonna be
using this is the glow on all natural
exfoliating pineapple wet mask oh my
gosh it smells so good oh I can't
explain it to you I wish you could smell
it it just smells like pineapple okay oh
my gosh that's nice
it's way nicer than like the sheet masks
because like it's got little earpieces
so it doesn't fall but I still look
funny no no I'm gonna leave this on for
ten minutes so while I have this on I'm
going to meditate person who is a bit of
a doer
then this exercise can feel quite kind
of passive in its approach almost feels
I'll be kind of not doing enough oh my
gosh look Oh Massa so I meditated for 10
minutes I feel great I'm actually doing
like a two week meditation course on
there for self esteem which is something
I really need to work on so it's
definitely been good for me and
so my skin feels incredible like
incredible so excited that I found them
because they're cruelty-free vegan and
affordable all-natural organic
everything you can want I will have
bubble and bow linked in the description
box they also have a discount code
Lindsey xx Murray 15 for 15% off of your
purchase check them out
ok I'm also going to read a little bit
now that I meditated I don't really want
to just jump right back into watching TV
I'm sure I'm gonna watch plenty more
today so I'm going to read a little bit
of my book at least like just a few
chapters or something
okay so whoa you are so soon zoomed in
and expect for you be that close fine
I'd only think I love doing on paper
teens is planning out things I have to
do this week or like planning out videos
which sounds where you get some people
may think like that sounds like work why
would you do that on paper routine but
hey do what you like if you don't like
your that stuff don't do it if you want
to take a nap we're all freaking out so
I'm gonna plan out some videos for the
next few weeks
and probably keep watching them burn
it's a problem
this is the all over it Oregon in
lavender oil for skin hair nails by
bubble and bow as well I thought I would
do a little bit of a hair treatment into
my hand and I'm going to put this all
through on my hair well it smells really
really good
so I'm just going to go and do a quick
self-tan yeah so I'm just gonna use my
Bondi Sam self-tanning foam this is in
the shade a dark I've not used this in
like a year so let's see what happens so
I decided I went ahead and rinse off
rinsed off my soft tan a little while
ago but I decided to leave this in
overnight just because it feels fine my
hair is actually still pretty clean I
give it goes for the morning and
honestly it's easier for me to wash my
hair in the morning anyway he's willing
to let air dry you guys so much for
watching this side of the light isn't
too great but it is nighttime Noah is
still gone I he was in class all day
today and then he went to work so I
haven't seen him almost all day but I'm
