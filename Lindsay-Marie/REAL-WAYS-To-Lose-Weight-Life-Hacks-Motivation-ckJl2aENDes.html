today I'm doing a real ways to lose
weight video a lot of you guys have
requested this and I just thought no no
no no no don't be licking yourself back
there Oh
inside note look how cute my new socks
are are these not the cutest little now
I gained the typical like Freshman
Fifteen when I went to college like no
doubt and it took me a while to finally
like find ways to lose that weight but
over time I was able to lose the weight
and get back to my normal size so today
I am I tell you what works for me what
works for people that I know and hope
that this helps you the first thing is
to start calorie counting calorie
counting is very smart you're trying to
lose weight basically if you take away
500 calories a day from what you need to
maintain your weight then by taking 500
away every single day you'll lose about
a pound a week and that's just by
calorie counting that's not including
other things you can be doing as well
now there's different ways to calorie
count you can do it on pen and paper and
write it down everyday you can use apps
I know a lot of people use the I think
it's called my fit pal I'll figure it
out I'll figure out what it's called and
put it down below I think it's called my
Fit Pal basically I think you like put
in your weight how much you want away
and it tells you how many calories you
need to have a day to lose like however
much your goal is to lose every single
week now I stand a way for losing weight
is detoxing there's so many different
ways to detoxing but I think T detox is
are really smart because you can
basically do it you could do this for 14
days this is a 28 day but I didn't do
the full 28 days obviously I did like 14
days took a break and then when I feel
like I need to do it again I'll have
another 14 days left in the box
but detox teas basically just take all
the toxins out of your body if you've
been eating a lot of junk food which
kind of cleanses out your system and a
lot of people feel like I feel I felt
like I lost all of my bloating I lost
all the excess weight that I just
typically didn't have that I just sort
of got from eating a lot of unhealthy
food sit for a while so it really just
helps you get off the excess weight that
you don't typically have that you've
gained from like excess junk food and I
just this is super great now the third
thing I like to do is replace the meals
with juices or shakes you can do a
three-day juice cleanse if that's
something you're up to I did the urban
Normandy juice cleanse a while ago and I
did lose four pounds and three days
that is you know a big difference but I
don't know if I do one again because I
like eating and I don't like going three
days without chewing on some things so
if you don't want to do this 3 day juice
cleanse what I recommend is just
replacing meals with juices or shakes
now you have to make sure it's something
that actually has nutrients not just any
kind of like juice not like apple juice
obviously it needs me an actual Geauga
pressed cold-pressed juice or smoothies
or shakes there's so many different
things just replacing one meal a day or
one meal every other day with a liquid
just gives your body time to digest
faster and it boosts your metabolism so
it's a really really really good thing
to do it's just replace one meal a
everyday or every other day with a juice
a shake or a smoothie my next step is to
just replace your salty foods you don't
understand how much your salty foods are
bad for you I love salt vinegar chips I
do but I know I can only have those very
very rarely I don't let myself have them
too often when I'm really craving some
kind of like salted chips I like to get
through like the green pea crisps these
are really good um they don't really
taste they're they're not it's gonna
salt minute your tips I'm not gonna lie
to you
but there's they give me like that
little salty miss that I'm craving and
I'm good to go and I'm not like as
tempted to go and grab a bag of chips so
replace like your salty snacks sometimes
it's something that's a little bit
better for you and maybe even if your
sweet foods if you have a sweet tooth
often maybe replace your candy with
dried fruit dried strawberries are
delicious it tastes just like having
like some kind of gummy candy to me oh
those are so good
and my last tip is working out and
trying yoga now there's so many workout
classes but one thing people don't
realize is yoga is actually a really
good way to help your body lose weight
it's because yoga sort of helps you get
a better lifestyle because it's like a
it's like a mind thing as well but
you're in there you're when you're doing
you but you are sweating out toxins from
your body you are pouring sweat and yoga
you're pulling out toxins which makes
your body lose weight it makes your body
feel better it's hard to explain but
there's so much like recent research
done to show that yoga really does help
you lose weight but I think working out
in general is obviously a good idea I
think 3 days a week is a good starting
point I do three to four days a week and
that's it I don't like to go over 4 but
I think finding a workout class that
really works for you your lifestyle and
your preferences is a really smart thing
to do I do
c'mon yoga bar class is my favorite if I
was if I was a pic and you work out I
think bars my favorite but bars not
really to lose weight bars more to tone
your body so yoga really helps people
lose weight and also get really flexible
and then bar option also helps you
seriously tone your body and I've really
lengthen your muscles but those are all
of my tips to help you guys if you're on
in like a weight loss journey I hope
this helped you also guys let me know if
you want to see a healthy lunch video I
feel like lunch is the hardest time of
the day for me not eat unhealthily just
because dinner and breakfast I tend to
be a home so I can cook but lunch most
people are at work or at school or
they're out and about and that's when
you tend to grab something that's not as
healthy for you
so if you'd like for me to do a healthy
lunch ideas video for things you can
take on the go make sure to give this
video a thumbs up and if it gets enough
thumbs up I will do a healthy lunch
ideas video and I will put it up this

possible and I will do a healthy lunch
