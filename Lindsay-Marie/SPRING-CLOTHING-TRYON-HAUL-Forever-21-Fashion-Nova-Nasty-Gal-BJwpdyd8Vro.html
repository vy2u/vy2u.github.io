guys and welcome back to my channel or
welcome if you happen to be new today's
video is going to be a whole video
before we get started make sure you are
subscribed down below if you like my
content want to see more and absolutely
what am i doing absolutely make sure you
turn on those notifications because as
you know if you might not know either
way YouTube has changed the algorithm
and you pretty much only see content
when people you have notifications from
I don't know why they're doing that but
turn on those notifications you don't
miss any of my videos and I'm also gonna
start doing shoutouts for people that
are very active on my channel so what
I'm gonna start doing is every once a
week or every other video I'm going to
shout out someone who is very active on
my channel and with my content so all
you need to do is make sure you're a
subscriber with my notifications on so
you're not missing any of my videos and
be commenting on every single video I
put out which really isn't that many
video so it's not that hard to keep up
with so first run forever 21 I got two
pairs of shorts because I don't really
have any shorts anymore I got this pair
right here just plain white these were
ten bucks ten dollars and I was like
that is a steal another pair of them in
all black also still $10 so I'm so
excited because ten dollars for shorts I
was like gotta get two pair so next up I
got this the maxi skirt and I don't know
what you can't really tell right here
but I'll be trying everything on I don't
know this looks exactly like I thought I
was going to look but it's just a maxi
skirt with two slits it's caught it in
my maxi skirt because it's got two slits
one for each leg and this looks like a
very thin material that almost could be
see-through hopefully not but I'd only
own a mini skirts and I really want to
start wearing some sometimes I thought
like a plain black maxi would be like
really good for me and would really like
fit my style and stuff so hopefully next
I got a typical tube top I actually
don't really own much like this I did
wear one on Instagram but it's actually
a swimsuit top so I thought I would pick
them up I see a lot of girls wearing
these and spring and summer easy to
throw with like some kimonos and stuff I
didn't realize how small this was gonna
be I was hoping it'd be a little bit
longer but hopefully when it's on
be like as small it was only $7 and I
can always exchange it for bigger size
that I need to and then I also got to a
plane super simple extremely cheap
tank-tops this was a dollar 90 and I
also got a plain black one again also a
dollar 90 so it's like I should have got
one in like every color but you know
rocking on a budget next I got this
romper and I'm still not sure about it
when I'm holding it up hopefully when I
try it on I love it I was so back and
forth on the side I'd be like you know
I'd really really liked it and I look
look at it like in a small icon when I
was looking at my check out I was like
you know maybe I don't like that and
then I click on the photo and it
wouldn't it would be like in large looks
like you know what I do like that so I
couldn't make up my mind obviously so I
was like it's 15 bucks let's get it and
if I don't like it I can return it so
we'll see it's polka dotted with some
oranges on there hopefully I like it I
wasn't a big romper person last year but
I'm trying to bring it out you know I'm
trying to get away from just my graphic
tees jeans and veins if you haven't
noticed I'm trying this is the next one
maybe a little too bright for me but I'm
gonna wear I'm gonna make myself and
this is just a lemon bodysuit tube-top
bodysuit or like a strapless bodysuit
that is bright though I knew it's gonna
be bright I picked it out but I don't I
never wear super bright stuff but I feel
like this could be fine with my white
boots I wear all the time I'm eight
bucks and lemons are cute next I just
got this plain of black romper again
trying to wear rompers this year I like
this one since it's plain black would
look really good with kimonos and
jackets since it's so spring and it does
get pretty cool here in Ohio I like the
plain black stuff like if they'll be
super easy to wear with other things
next I got this white button-up it looks
like a million other white button-up so
I already own but who doesn't need a few
more kidding though cuz I wanted this
one of her a while but it looks really
cute on the model it's got a cute little
tie it's a little slouchy around the
shoulders now I did buy some stuff from
fashion hobo but I'm not gonna show you
all of it because a lot of it I got for
my trip to Austin Texas and I wore a lot
of it in my trip at awesome ties to
Texas so if it's something that I wore
up
in that video I figured you don't want
to see it twice but one of the things I
got were these yellow pants that I wore
in a photo eating Donuts on my Instagram
and everyone was saying how much they
loved these pants my friends when I was
wearing it really loved them these are
really comfortable they're a little too
long ago me but I love them I need more
stuff like this because these were
really fun
they made me feel really confident and I
feel like anything that makes you feel
confident like you need more of so
probably gonna get more of these and I
also got some graphic tees I got this
one that says ac/dc and this one is a
David Bowie one and I also got one that
is white this has girl power all over it
but I wore it right after a soft hand
and it's really it's always that milah
hair is in there but it got a little
orange for my self tanner so I have to
wash it and I haven't done that yet so
I'm not gonna see that one today but I
will say faction Nova has some of my
favorite graphic t-shirts or crop tops
not rock wrap yet both like crop tops
they're a really nice crop where they're
not too short but not too long they're
really good length and just love like
the look of them so heads up no I got
some stuff from Nasty Gal I was so
excited guys Nasty Gal when I was
shopping was also having 40% off that's
why I was doing all this shopping
there's a lot of sales I have never
bought anything from Nasty Gal
why cuz I really couldn't afford it for
a long time and then when I could afford
it it's like my old can't afford stuff
mentality it was like girl you don't
need to buy stuff that expensive but
they were having such a good sale with a
40% off that it almost made the stuff
some of it was cheaper than my forever
21 stuff so I was like I have to get
some stuff and I'm so excited so so
excited so first up another Robert Wow
really getting out of my comfort zone
guys this is called the ditzy ditzy oh
come on
ditzy floral open back place ooh is that
another word for romper I think it is
but I thought this was really really
cute I don't typically like floral stuff
it's usually a little too girly for me
I'm not very into girly fashion if you
are that's fine just not my thing but
this I feel like because it's a black
romper and it's like dark red floral
with pops of green I felt like I could
rock this with like some combat boots or
some tennis shoes maybe and make it more
maybe even with these shoes and make it
more of my style so I thought
try it so I got this t-shirt right here
that says saucy um go really really cute
really fun I thank you too much I love
the font I'm gonna wear this all the
time I'm just gonna live in this shirt
okay so next I got a two-piece set I've
got these black polka dot shorts and it
also has this black polka dotted like
tight around tube top shirt and I'm
excited it's very very out of my comfort
zone I'm very weird about wearing tube
tops I feel very like nervous but I'm
trying to get out of my comfort zone
that's really important to me is
stepping out so I'm gonna rock it and
I'm gonna feel good about it now doing
it so hopefully you hold me to it and
next I got this yellow two-piece set
basically as a top that is yellow a
little tiny a thin white stripes and
also has some pants as well that are
inside out but you'll see it when I'm
trying it on but I thought this was
really cute and I did not expect it to
be really soft I thought it was gonna be
like I don't know it's scratchy like a
tight fitted material but instead it's
actually like a soft pajama material
meaning I will probably wear this all
the time when it's warm enough I
actually took the photos they wore
wearing this and like 40 degree weather
and I was I was cold
okay so I got this white tube top it's
like the black one I got from forever 21
this was 7 bucks from asking out with
the sale I do remember that the only
thing is I did not know who's gonna be
this thin this is so I already I
literally have a swimsuit top that I
wear like a band or like a crop tube
thing like this all the time and it's
padded this is literally so sheer and
thin I don't know how I would wear this
like my nips would be literally like
hello so like what are you supposed to
do with this this might this might get
returned because I feel like that is not
going to be appropriate on then I also
got this shirt right here this is a very
different shirt for me to wear it looks
like I'm like a bandana I think that's
actually what my friend of clothes that
looks like a bandana but like in a shirt
and everyone likes bandanas and I love I
love the pattern it's really nice to
like dress up in like an edgy way that I
can wear this
I'm going like somewhere nice and don't
feel like wearing a dress cuz I never
feel like wearing dresses and wear with
jeans and like some nice heels and still
feel fancy enough that I can try and
kind of fit it and then I got two shirts
from Target at first I got this white
button-up right here I just needed a
plain white button-up even though I just
I just showed you another one minute ago
I have so many but this one is different
because it's like a men's like a
boyfriend type but not the ones that you
know you'd steal from your boyfriend I
thought this one was really cute and
I've worn this multiple times it's
really soft I just wanted a I feel you
can throw it over swimsuits and just
wear it as a shirt and I just and I also
got this denim jacket here's a section a
denim button-up shirt okay
I have bought and gotten five million
didn't up denim button-ups and I never
wear anything literally I never wear
them however I feel like usually they're
really thick material or they're like
really really girly and again I don't
like super girly stuff but I thought
this one it's like a nice casual denim
shirt like I'd wear this as a jacket or
not and it's not like too out there one
of them I have it's like bedazzled I'm
like I'm not wearing up a desolate shirt
so I like this one I feel like I'm
actually gonna wear it I've actually
worn this twice already so I'm giving
myself props I was a little nervous cuz
it was like 30 bucks I might Lindsay you
better wear it this is your last chance
with a denim shirt but I've worn it so
I'm doing good then I got three items
from Lulu's actually I was gonna buy a
lot from Lulu I had a ton of my clark
but honestly everything from Lulu's
ended up being more expensive than my
other stuff so I took a lot of it out
and fun fact though Lulu is my childhood
nickname every one of my family calls me
Lulu so maybe that's why I want to shop
there I don't know I never have before
so I was excited first thing up speaking
of childhood I got the show says peachy
and it's so weird maybe it's because I'm
from Georgia I always like stuff that
says like peachy or has peaches on it I
was like oh I need that even though I
moved out of Georgia as fast as I could
I don't know now there's
George it's beautiful but I really
wanted this because it says peachy and I
feel like maybe I'm peachy but I'm not
but I want it anyway so it would be cute
okay and I actually wanted one from
Urban Outfitters but it was like $50 or
something and I was like for a t-shirt
next I got this shirt and I kind of wish
I'd gotten like five more I may buy more
of these not today but I love the look
of this crop t-shirt with a little like
already done fold an int I like thing
I've seen people wear shirts like this
where it's kind of like not tied you
know I'm saying look how it looks at the
front I really think that's so cute
that's really cute it's a really cute
way of having a crop top on and not
having to tie your shirt up I like the
look that a lot and I love the color
this was really like a really pretty
blue gray I'm trying I have so many
things in black and white and then I
have either black and white or back from
the days when I was trying to pretend I
was like a 15 year old for my video four
views we know we've talked about this it
was a bad it was a bad time I either
have bright colors I'm trying to get rid
of that are too too bright for me or I
have black-and-white so I'm trying to
get more like grays and browns and stuff
so this is really pretty I really like
this color and this is really soft so
that is everything in my haul I took I
feel like it took me forever to go
through this hopefully and cut it down
