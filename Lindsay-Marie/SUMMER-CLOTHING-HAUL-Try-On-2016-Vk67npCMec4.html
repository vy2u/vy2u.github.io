or welcome if you are new my name is
Lindsay Marie today's video is going to
be a huge haul now this is different
than my normal hauls typically I will
have clothes from all over the place but
today I decided to do a haul from one
specific store and that is an online
wholesale shop called The Fool za ful so
I literally kind of went crazy I was
online shopping and I decided to get a
ton of stuff and I thought um I would
try it all on for you guys if we can
decide about everything together so yeah
I've got a good bit so let's go ahead
and get started the first I just got
this really cute like salmon e crop top
it's kind of pink kind of Sam and kind
of orange e I like it a lot it is like a
cropped t-shirt really comfy I think
this will be really cute with like some
shorts my converse I also got a really
cute pink crocheted top and this is
really really cute umm the strings are
kind of thin so that makes me a little
nervous but I think it should be fine I
just have to be kind of careful
I got a lime-green one but this one
actually is only in the front so like
it's like completely backless I also got
this super cute bathing suit cover-up
I've never really had any swimsuit
cover-ups I always just really shorts
like a tank top or something um but I
always notice when I went to like Vegas
and stuff everyone has like these cute
like dresses and cover-ups so I got this
really cute like crocheted why do I
think it's really pretty
I don't know how we're like all the time
because I don't want like crazy tan
lines ups look I don't know crazy tan
lines like freaked me out I don't know
about you guys but having little weird
tan lines like really scares me I also
got a really cute two-piece it's just a
blue and white striped top and like
shorts like pair this was actually
really cute online and it's still really
cute in person but I don't know for sure
if it's like my style I do like it a lot
but these shorts are kind of big and so
I don't know if maybe it's just like my
body type or something I do like it and
I might wear it but it's not like 100%
positive let me know what you guys think
down below do you like this yes or no so
got another two-piece and this one is a
black and white stripe and it's got a
really cute top right here that I would
actually probably wear alone all the
time like with like a pair of like black
shorts or something and then it has it
the matching shorts I got a huge
oversized plaid jacket or like plaid
shirt because I've never have one of
these it's like so cute people wrap them
around their waist and stuff and I know
like I've never done that in here where
I move too
that's like super trendy I mean it's
trendy everywhere but people literally
all the time how these tied around their
waist I think it's really cute I think
it'd be really cute like a t-shirt dress
it's really cute with like shorts and a
tank top it's cute with jeans and then
they also in the wintertime or like the
fall tie this would be cute just to wear
over a shirt as well next I got a really
cute black and white striped bodysuit
now this kind of makes you look like I'm
in jail let's be serious but it is still
really cute I think what's in like black
cutoff shorts you like some black ripped
up jeans or something this could be
really cute got this really cute tank
top I actually got two of them I got a
white one and a grey one just a really
simple tank top with the like the
lace-up like front sort of that calls it
the lace-up you know what I'm talking
about the lace up detail everyone's
doing right now I think this is really
cute I'm really simple really casual I
got this really really cute like dark
maroon dress now I feel like this is a
little thin when I put it on so I might
have to get like a slip to put
underneath it but it is really cute it's
one of my sadder pieces I'm kind of sad
about these so these are these white
cutoff shorts I got these making me a
little sad because I got the correct
size but they're a little too big
however I might make it work I could get
like a big belt but the problem with
these is there's no place for the button
like you don't know if you see this um
like they sewed the buttonhole like
completely shut like the button doesn't
go through do you see this like there's
no hole where the button goes like
there's literally just like a sewed up
little button hole I don't know how that
happened I'm sure it was like an
accident but yeah these are really cute
they're a little too big but I could
make them work but there's no way to
button them so what I might like try and
take some scissors and cut a little hole
right here
but if not it I guess I can't wear this
actually got a super cute like sea foam
green swimsuit I absolutely love this it
should got like the simple plain bottoms
but it's also got like the wraparound
top which I really love this was so
affordable if you're looking for a good
swimsuit like that's affordable The Fool
does have a ton of swimsuits and they're
all like really trendy but they're also
like really affordable I'm pretty sure
I'm going to go back and buy like a ton
of swimsuits from them next I have a
crazy body too looks like just a blob in
my hands but on it's so cute
the reason it's so
because you literally like put it on and
you take these like long things and wrap
them around you and it becomes like the
cutest thing ever we got a really really
cute like dark moon table I don't know
if you can tell though but there's
something on it at the bottom I don't
know if I got on something on it or if
it came like that because I haven't
actually worn it I just took it out of
the bag like two minutes ago but maybe I
have something on my hands or something
I don't know but obviously I'll just
wash it's not a big deal but this is
really really cute this is really simple
next I got this super super cute baby
blue top I have actually worn this out
you might have seen it in my snapchat I
literally love this I got so many
compliments when I was wearing this out
it actually zips up in the front and
it's like a really pretty like baby blue
um like a t-shirt tank top kind of thing
it's really really form-fitting really
cute with some white jeans I got so many
compliments when I wore this I'm
probably gonna buy it and yeah they had
other colors of it I'll probably go back
and buy the other colors I got a super
cute like a knitted tank top this is
really cute I don't know what I wear
with maybe like some really light
colored jeans or two light colored skirt
actually um but I like the color it's
different than anything I have I get a
super cute like tight knitted light blue
shirt this is really cute on I really
like this would be really cute with some
like white shorts if those shorts
weren't messed up this is so cute um
this is reminds me of something that
like my life is a TiVo and where I feel
like she wears stuff like this all the
time and I always think it's so cute so
I really like it looks very like brandy
melville really summery really in I like
it I got a super cute tank top and I
said super because it says super really
cute oh my gosh I love this oh I just
opened this and this is so cute look at
this it's like a velvety material so
really pretty brown oh my gosh this is
so cute it's got the lace detail at the
bottom oh my goodness I love it next I
got a super super cute like overall
dress skirt thing I don't even know what
you would call this but it's basically a
super cute body con black skirt which I
can never have too many of these but it
has like straps like overall so it could
wear a really cute crop top underneath
it a really cute bralette that's
probably what I'll do really cute for a
night out but it also makes it a little
edgier and like different I love this
we should open the stuff before it
starts oh my gosh how cute are you oh my
gosh I love this okay so nice is this
really cute like crop tops cropped
t-shirt I love the material wish you
could feel it it's like really stretchy
so it'll still be like form-fitting but
it's also like a loose fitting so it's
kind of the best of both worlds but it
is blue white and red stripes merica I'm
just kidding America but anyways just
that's a joke calm down I think it's
really cute this would be so cute with
like my converse and like a some cutoff
shorts this is so cute I love stuff like
this like simple stuff like this is what
I live for
I also got this SuperDuper cute um black
body Khonsu really cute
I'm just simple like black t-shirt types
we could wear with anything it's really
cute it's got a really cute pink tank
top it's just like a really cute I don't
know simple pink tank top 10 couple
things the straps are kind of long and I
don't know but I had like really like
shorts all shoulders so when things have
long straps I typically can't wear them
but obviously I'm doing a try on so
we'll find out if I wore it or not we'll
see yes I got this really cute like
palm-tree tank top it's kind of I don't
know what what you would call this like
fitted cuz it's not it's not really
fitted it's almost like not Jersey tight
but the kind of you get I'm saying this
would be cute on with a casual day I
think it's cute I don't really have
anything with like a palm-tree design I
like to strive to the bottom to this
really cute black tank top I just said
queue again wow I have issues it's just
plain black but the cool thing is it has
cutouts on the side I love that so it
makes it like it goes from like just
like a simple tank top to like an edgier
cuter tank top and then I also got these
really cute shorts I love these I pretty
much only got these for Bonnaroo okay my
neighbor just walked by and he's looking
in my window oh my gosh he's like what
is wrong with this girl why she filled
me in her room
oops already got to see that that's
awkward
okay anyway so I got these really cute
I'm gray shorts oh I love the fringe at
the bottom these will be really cute
like a comfy day or just when I need
like you cozy shorts a pair of destroyed
denim jeans actually I haven't tried to
I haven't tried most of this on but I
always worry about like when i buy pants
and stuff online you never know if it's
going to fit so hopefully these fit the
artist story they have a lot of cuts
on the legs are looked at you know down
the side I like these so I really like
them right here so I'm hoping they fit
me
I'm not least I got two pairs of shoes
the first ones I got are these black
booties really simple these are just
really in you know when you're going out
and stop everyone has like a simple pair
of black booties but not me so these are
perfect just for simple stuff I'm
rambling you know and then the last
thing is probably my favorite thing off
the entire website that I purchased oh
my gosh look at these oh okay so I just
got these white booties with this cute
buckle in the cute cutout it's actually
gonna go rose gold right here I want you
to see this on camera but it's got like
a pink rose goldish like like lining
right here these are to die for these
are so cute I love these I probably will
wear these like almost every day
I love these Wow okay I'm done talking
about them but I love them to say no I
love them I love them we love each other
and last but not least I forgot almost I
actually also got this shirt from the
website as well
this is actually my favorite shirt that
I bought so it's just a really cute
black tank top and it's got a really
cute cage design on the very top I love
this it just is really flattering this
would be really cute just for like an
everyday tank top you can wear
underneath stuff I just take out how do
I forget this I'm wearing it so thank
you so much for watching I hope you
enjoyed this haul like I said everything
that I everything that I got was from a
wholesale website called as a full da
ful I'm actually really impressed
because this is my I do shop wholesale a
lot but this stuff all came really fast
I think everything shipped within a week
and there aren't any really issues like
there's no problem with anything the
only thing is that one pair of shorts
has like the whole is missing but I can
honestly just take a pair of scissors
and cut it you know that's not a big
deal so I I'm pretty impressed I think
it's pretty good like for wholesale
shopping I'd say this is probably my
number one favorite wholesale shop I
will definitely buying more stuff
especially swimsuits maybe I'll buy a
bunch of their swimsuits and do a
swimsuit haul let me know in the
