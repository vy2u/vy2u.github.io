or welcome if you are new today's video
is my diet and exercise routine mainly
my diet a little bit of my it's just
it's all of that goodness yeah this is
also a collab with my good friend Laura
Reed here on YouTube she has awesome
videos she travels a lot so she does
videos like all over the world she does
crazy travel vlogs
she just lifestyle videos she does all
types of videos she's beautiful she's
really nice she's gonna be doing her
summer fitness routine so make sure
you're done watching my video to go
ahead and check out her channel and
check out her video I will have it
linked down below and if you're new to
my channel from her channel welcome if
you're new from anywhere welcome and I
hope you stick around and let's go ahead
and get going now when it comes to my
diet and what I like to do to stay in
shape and stay healthy one thing I
really like to do that people sometimes
like to hear some people sometimes
people don't like to hear it I do like
to do detox pees now this is the fit tea
detox tea and this is actually the only
one that I will recommend you because
it's the only one that I have finished
and done multiple times now I have try
other detox teas and I always end up
quitting them just because I either
don't like the taste or something like
that now the thing is when people say
they don't like detox teas my question
is why because it makes no sense now I'm
not gonna tell you that you're gonna
lose a million a million pounds I'm not
gonna tell you that you can lose a ton
of weight and you're just gonna be super
in shape just by from drinking tea I'm
not gonna tell you that now that would
be a little bit bogus but the thing is
there's nothing bad in a detox tea so
there's no reason for people to dislike
them does that make sense please there's
nothing bad in these it's just filled
with natural good ingredients natural
things that are good for your body so
either way you're just putting something
good into your body and it does detox
your system either way so basically by
drinking a detox tea this one is the one
I recommend like I said you are
basically just detoxing and cleansing
your body of the bad stuff it is
basically a way to hit the reset button
on your digestive system if you spend
all this time eating a bunch of a bunch
of junk food and then all of a sudden
you wouldn't eat really healthy
sometimes it's hard to just go from junk
food to really healthy your body's like
no no no it craves the junk food now
detox teas can really really help you
ease in from going to health a junk food
to healthy food but I think the tea of
the 22 day detox is detox tea is a great
honestly if you're trying to go and be
healthier then I I think it's great I've
always have if you go back to any of my
old diet videos any of our fitness
videos I'm always talking about this tea
I've always used it not when it comes to
the foods I eat let me just basically
tell you my diet now in the summertime I
eat so much fruit vegetables it's not
even funny like I don't know how to tell
you but my body just craves those things
and if you aren't used to eating them
that's why your body doesn't crave them
but if you start eating them often you
will I promise you you will start
craving them
I crave salads I crave fruit now a good
way to get in your fruits and vegetables
if you aren't really big on salads or
eating you know eating the salad you're
eating spinach are smoothies you can add
in so much spinach into your smoothie
and you're not gonna taste it you cover
up that spinach with a bunch of fruit
frozen fruit some juice stuff like that
it's gonna be so delicious and that's
vegan and it's so anyone can enjoy that
so remember that food is a necessity to
live food should not be something that
you look at as like like a hobby but
that was my problem for a long time a
lot of people they can you look at food
as a hobby you know like I love all this
junk foods I just eat it all the time if
you think about it if you eat it all the
time it's not that special so honestly
when I go and I can set up like eating
Oreos like a whole bag of Oreos in one
setting if I just eat like some every
now and then when I eat them I
appreciate it so much more and I find
myself really enjoying it now it comes
to my fitness and my exercise I have
recently just honestly just been dancing
and being really active and now that
it's summertime I just like to be
outside and all you know that I love
like EDM dancing I love hip hop dancing
and I will spend like sometimes an hour
or two in my living room literally just
dancing and you can also just like
search on youtube like hip hop workouts
or hip hop dance workout or something
and that will also bring up a really fun
workout if you want like something to
follow along with but sometimes I'll
just do it on my own in my living room
and I've been going for job like jogs on
my own or walks in the morning and
taking my dogs on super long walks and
you know I've been going to spin class I
love a spin class it's so fun spin class
will literally get out so much energy
you burn so many calories it's almost
scary it's so much fun it's so high
energy when you're done with a cycle
class you feel like you can conquer the
world I'm pretty sure all cycling places
give you your first class for free I'm
pretty sure I'm not don't quote me on
that but every place I've ever been to
my first class was free so if you've
never been to a spin class you should
try it it's incredible get ready to
sweat a lot you're ready to push
yourself to the limit but honestly in
spin class you will get to a point where
you feel like you can't do it anymore
because you're cycling hardcore for 45
minutes halfway through you might feel
like you can't do it anymore but you
realize you can and you're gonna keep
cuz you have to do honestly you're not
really able to stop so you keep going
you keep going before you know it you
completed it and you realize wow it's
mind over matter you can do whatever you
want like if your body may not feel like
it wants to do it but it can we have
strong awesome powerful bodies you can
do whatever you want so honestly get
your fruits and veggies in there try out
a detox tea don't be so scared of it
don't expect instant results but try it
out didn't just be active and be happy
and also don't spend your whole life
looking at the scale and looking at
other people don't look at other people
and decide if that you know do not
decide your happiness on someone else's
body type know that your body type is
beautiful this is not about being a
certain body size a certain body shape a
certain weight it is about being happy
healthy and happy and healthy that's it
so if you are happy with your body and
then you are happy with your body and
it's beautiful okay please know that
your body is beautiful however it is do
not feel like you need to change me
thing this is just being about being
happier and healthier and this is just
what I do
