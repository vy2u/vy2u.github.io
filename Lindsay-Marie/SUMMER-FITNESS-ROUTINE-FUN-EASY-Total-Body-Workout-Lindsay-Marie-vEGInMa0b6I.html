I'm doing my summer fitness routine if
you guys had requested this this is a
total body workout but if you want to
see specific workouts like an ab workout
or thigh workouts let me know in the
comments also don't forget to give this
video a thumbs up if you want to see
more of this subscribe to ngo if you
haven't already I have a lot of summer
fitness routines coming out and let's
get into the video
I typically like to saw off all my
workouts with a plank
I find that plinking is great to
strengthen your core and that's I've
been thinking for about a minute or so I
like to stretch the back of my heel I
just simply pulse my heels back and
forth for a few time just kind of helps
me hold my plank a little longer next I
go into my leg lifts I start by lifting
my leg straight up with my knee bent and
then I do something with my leg straight
out with my toes either flexed or
pointed down either way and then after
that I like to go into some toe taps
where I just tap my toes to the side and
then bring them out to the other side so
I just tapped to the opposite side of my
body and then bring it back out next
still on all fours I like to bring my
opposite knee to touch my opposite elbow
this is great for core work it's also
great for your thighs and your butt and
it also helps you prove improve your
balance and your stability next I go
into my curl position I like to do some
leg lifts where I kick my leg to the sky
and then bring them back out and then
after that I like to do also scissor
kicks where I Decision my legs up and
down the entire time staying in my curl
position to keep my abs engaged next I
am doing squat pulses it's basically a
squat but you just keep pulsing down
instead of you know stopping in between
I also like to do some opposite heel
raises while I'm doing so to help me
also strengthen my legs as well now to
get myself moving I am doing a walking
lunge I typically do this for about two
or three minutes and then after that I
like to do some karate kicks and doing
the opposite arm while going backwards
just to keep me moving and keeping my
heart rate up once I'm done doing any
sort of cardio work I like to end with
some light yoga some stretching and then
I'm done with my summer fitness workout
routine
let me know if you guys want to see it
some more fitness workout routines maybe
