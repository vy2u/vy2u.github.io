welcome if you are new my name is
Lindsey Murray and today's video is my
summer morning routine now today's video
is actually brought to you by Fiji water
I don't do a lot of sponsorships unless
I truly love a product and I love Fiji
water
I've always been drinking Fiji water
it's what I always go to it's what I
always grab for now Fiji water can
actually be delivered to your doorstep
so Fiji actually just recently came out
with new seven hundred milliliter water
bottles as you can see here so cute but
so that there's slimmer and sleeker and
easier for like your on-the-go lifestyle
because now they can fit in your cup
holder or places like a treadmill and
stuff like that what makes it much
easier to carry it wherever you're going
but Fiji water has actually bottled at
the source in Fiji which is what makes
it like incredible it's also the cutest
water bottle ever like this is easily
the most Instagram above water bottle on
the planet like I always get these in
the first thing I do is like take a
picture um but now you can have it
delivered straight to your door you can
sign up for a subscription and you get a
free delivery and you can just grab out
of your fridge when you're ready to go
and take it with you all the time and
you always have fiji water always handy
I also do have a coupon code for 20% off
any of their services I will leave it
down below and yeah let's go ahead and
get into the video good morning you guys
so for this morning routine it is a
weekday so I did have to set an alarm
because I do have to work during the
week I'm a full time youtuber and I have
to do a lot during the day so I'll
typically typically wake up and love on
my dogs they're so cute in the mornings
they're always so excited when we first
wake up so yeah get a lots of puppy
kisses which is super exciting and then
are typically brows on my phone I'll go
on Instagram and snapchat typically I'll
do this for about 10 to 15 minutes while
I'm waking up sometimes I'll even post
like a good-morning snapchat so if you
guys want to follow me my Instagram and
snapchat are both at Lindsay xx Murray
linked down below and once I am done
doing all that on my phone it's time for
me to finally get out of bed now the
first thing I will do is make my bed
because I'm a youtuber I film on my beds
my bed has to be made anyway so we'll go
ahead and get that out of the way first
thing this also makes it where I can't
lay back down which is really important
next I'll make my way into the bathroom
because I'm going to go ahead and brush
my teeth some people like to brush after
they eat but I like to do it before
that's just how I've always done it now
it's time before my breakfast this
morning I was pretty lazy so I just made
some coffee a bagel and then I had a
banana as well and while you my
breakfast I know I showed you at the
table by typically we'll just eat in my
living room and watch some TV and just
kind of unwind and wake up a little bit
more
and now I will grab myself on my Fiji
waters out of my fridge really
convenient that they are delivered to my
door so I can always have them and it's
time for me to go ahead and do my
workout gotta get an end girl I
typically work out four days a week and
my workout really changes up honestly
just depending on my mood maybe I will
do a workout routine really soon let me
know in the comments if that's something
that you want to see
and now it's time for me to take a
shower dance I'm all sweaty I love
taking showers in the morning it really
really wakes me up and then after that I
will go ahead and blow-dry my hair and
then I'm going to get dressed after that
since it is summer I'm just wearing
shorts and a tank top and next I'm going
to go ahead and do my makeup and my hair
just to get ready for the day
you
and we all know this happens every time
we get ready don't lie I know I know you
do this - I know you do and the other
times when you sit down at my desk and
work on my computer and this is when I
will answer emails respond to YouTube
comments and all that stuff once I'm
done with all that here is an overview
of my outfit and everything I am out the
door and I'm done for the day
thank you guys so much for watching I'll
see you all next time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
