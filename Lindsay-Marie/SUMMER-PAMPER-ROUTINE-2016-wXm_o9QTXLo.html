book I like to start off with good
myself some type of treat for the day
this time it was Starbucks and of course
I like to light some candles just to get
like the mood going for myself in my
room and then I just like to start out
my day so first I decided to shave my
legs I love using my Gillette Venus
swirl razor and shaving cream this one
has like the flexible so it honestly
moves kind of like no other razor so I'm
not having to do like those really weird
like yoga poses in the shower that way I
don't miss my knees and my ankles and I
never cut myself with this and it leaves
my legs so soft and so smooth which
makes me feel like super confident
especially with it being like the
summertime
and I do want to say a big thanks to
Gillette Venus for partnering up with me
I've actually used their razors and
shaving cream for a long time so it's
really cool they reached out to me
now once I have super smooth clean legs
it's time we add some lotion just so my
skin is super hydrated and smooth and
soft and not dry I'm just using a
regular body lotion I got this one
actually off of Amazon but it has a
little bit of an SPF in it just in case
I'd go outside now typically go ahead
and lotion my entire body because who
doesn't like you know like super soft
skin I'll do my legs my arms my
shoulders especially around my chest
area right now coz I'm a little sunburnt
I'm in a little bit on my stomach as
well and because it did just get a new
glam glow face mask in the mail I really
wanted to try it out so I was doing a
face mask I put it all over my skin
after I had like wash it this morning
and this did tingle a good bit so just
get ready for that it does tingle I did
get really tight as well so I put this
on and you leave it on for about 10
minutes and while I leave it on I'll
typically like it read a chapter of my
book or like drink my Starbucks
sometimes I'll watch some TV this time I
decided to read my book that I'm
currently reading right now and then
once I let it all dry I rinse it off and
it turns into an exfoliator so I
exfoliated my skin and then rinse it
completely off and my skin did feel
really incredible afterwards
now it's time for you go ahead and paint
my nails I don't know what I was doing
okay I was in a weird mood this day
um so I'm just painting my toenails
because I am wearing sandals a lot of
the time in the summer and I was just
feel a little bit more confident but my
toenails are painted and not like super
actively looking and they look ratchet a
lot all the time so yeah this has really
needed to be done guys now it's time for
me to go ahead and do a deep conditioner
my hair really has been needing this
lately I guess because of the Sun and I
did lighten my hair a little bit and
also I had those carrots and extensions
my hair's been pretty dry and damaged
and it's been tangling a lot so I did
add a deep conditioner for about an hour
once I rinse that out I'm going to brush
out my hair and then I moved on to my
moisturizer I'm trying to stay away from
wearing foundation from now on because I
don't really have bad skin until I wear
foundations I've been trying to skip
foundation so I'm trying out the glam
glow moisturizer supposed to leave your
skin really like dewy looking so yeah
this did seem to look pretty good I'm
actually pretty impressed I'll let you
guys know like you know how I feel later
on and now it's time to whiten my teeth
I honestly love whitening my teeth
because it makes me feel so confident
this is my white with style in the
bubble mint flavor I just molded like my
little teeth things what fits my teeth I
added in the teeth whitening gel and
then waited for about 30 minutes with
the UV light in my mouth my teeth did
get about 2 to 3 shades of brighter and
the last I'm just adding a little bit of
makeup obviously if you're not going
anywhere you could skip this but I
decided last minute that I want to go
get some Panera so I added on just some
basic simple makeup like I said skipping
foundation I'm just going right to the
basics and then I'm going to blow-dry my
hair a little bit just so it's not like
crazy it was already about 95% dry
anyways
once I've blow-dried all of my hair
should add in my luxury for princess
extensions I'm so glad I went back to
these I did use the keratin ones for a
while and honestly they kind of ruined
my hair once I took them out so I did go
back to my luxury for princess clip-in
extensions these are in the honey clouds
ombre color they're beautiful they're so
easy to clip in and my hair feels so
much but I'm so glad I went back to
these you guys I'm so happy um so yeah
