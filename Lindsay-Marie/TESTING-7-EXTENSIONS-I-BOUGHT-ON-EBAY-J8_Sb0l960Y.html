together later put on the side knows I'm
pretty person extensions
hey guys and it looks like my channel or
welcome if you are new today still we
are trying out eBay extensions so I got
these extensions off of ebay my has a
listing I'll pull it up real quick now
supposedly these are supposed to be
human hair extensions when you click on
the red ones it brings your price up to
seven dollars versus the original four
oh my gosh crazy who's just kidding but
anyways the listing says the little miss
little confusing because it shows the
extensions and it says real thick clip
in hair extensions straight full head
human hair extension so what's up some
long hair this is what they look like
these are say s no a life no these do
not feel like human oh my god what is
this just feels like a costume wig from
Party City
hahahaha now these are not going to
match my hair perfectly and I obviously
cannot die V it was very hard to find
the color that was going to match my
hair but that's not really not the point
just to see whether or not these are
good quality these are very very thin so
it said this is a full head of hair
they're very long either very thinly I'm
going to have the thinnest little rat
tails on the side of my head but hey
let's let's do this let's cut these bad
boys in our they are retailing all I
have with companies so I'm trying to
pull them apart and just like one big
tangle okay we found we got I want to
Clinton up these are so thin oh my gosh
and they're definitely not straight or
curls I'm assuming they expect for
people to style them it doesn't look
like they're sewn on badly these look
like the clips will definitely hold so
the clips might be okay it does come
with extra clips which is nice and when
your Clips break Josh Heupel said give
you them tangled like what the hell is
it
okay how are you so sick how are you how
are you supposed oh my god oh my oh my
oh my oh my gosh please separate my oh
my gosh this is literally in the biggest
not I'm going to attempt to brush this
out because these aren't got really not
it and I haven't even I've never worn
use I just opened them and trying to
separate them so do not blame this on me
oh no my brush is stuck in it
okay so I clip them all in they are
knotted like crazy and this is what they
look like right now I can brush them out
a little bit better oh my gosh these
things are Wow Wow okay so I got them
all in I don't know what happened when I
was taking them out but they were in a
tangled mess in so many pieces of hair
just falling out everywhere so so far
I'm going to say these are crap okay
so micro hard if you did up and now
we're going to try and curl these I
think I need to curl them like without
my hair in it I know that sounds weird
but like I don't want to
if this like it's such a human hair but
I can tell from feeling this this that
this is plastic so for some reason it's
like melt off I don't want to melting
onto my hair so I think I am just going
to like kind of swing my hair back
obviously this is not gonna look super
cute right now but this is not my fault
okay gosh I'm like really scared I'm
going to do it okay just do it just do
it to do it to do it oh my god oh my
gosh max is gonna wrap them so that way
if something happens and they start
catching on fire I hold it for like 15
seconds which is a lot well we don't
have a girl
ah sytems hot okay so it didn't curl but
they didn't break off okay that makes me
feel better
okay I'm gonna try one more piece and
then we're probably just going to give
up yep same thing absolutely nothing
they don't they don't curl alright good
so there you have a guide this is one of
the quickest video on the universe I try
it out three to seven dollar extensions
mine cost seven users must be 23 inch
long full head of
hair extensions as you can tell I
clearly think they are plastic they shed
almost I don't know if you can tell in
this valchek shed so much I literally
have a mound of hair in that plastic bag
and the first time that I opened them
every time I brush them like those 100
hairs come out they not up out they keep
matted really quickly and they're too
thin they're just they're crap they
don't curl you can't curl them so these
are going on the trash ok guys I hope
