welcome to your new first stop for all
you guys who are wondering my ring is
back everyone thought like but maybe I
wasn't engaged anymore no guys no no I
am engaged to love my life so I promise
my green was just getting resized that's
worth betting but it's back in and
anyway thank you is another whole video
I know what you're thinking Lindsay
seriously you went shopping again it's
like you guys seem to really like my
whole I mean they're getting the most
views on my channel so it's like if you
don't mind I don't mind it's gonna be
like real for a minute cuz there are
some people who leave comments like you
spend so much money on clothes and first
off my finances aren't anybody's
business if I go broke one day because I
buy some new clothes
that's only my business it's my fault
not your fault the one you care I don't
matter but to be completely honest like
I grew up with very little money and I
didn't wear a really cute clothes I
didn't get to dress how I want it which
is fine you know it's okay I think if I
got me from all the time because I wore
like Walmart clothes and stuff and I
think now I am 24 years old and have a
full-time job that pays me money that I
can buy clothes with if I want to buy a
cute clothes I'm gonna buy a few clothes
now this is I'm only saying that just
because I tagged on a lot of got a few
some comments people like complaining
about how many halls I do so I just
don't know like that clear that it's
like I feel like I I think I earned the
right to be able to buy these cute
clothes just wanted to clear that up now
first as always I went to forever 21
because I live there I mean forever 21
to me is like the IKEA of clothing
stores like list literally so the first
thing I got from forever 21 is this
really really cute now funny story I was
walking down Melrose with my best friend
Amanda and there's a girl wearing this
exact same shirt and I was like oh my
gosh your shirts so cute and she said
thank you and she walked away and then I
was in forever 21 and I was like oh my
gosh that is the same shirt and then I
got this over the shoulder a black and
white top this is on sale for like eight
dollars it's so on sale I saw it I just
want you thinks a few days ago so for
like eight bucks really cute black with
like a white leaf pattern over the
shoulder really flowy really simple but
very cute okay then I also got this
shirt right here
said vegetable addict California it's
kind of very like music festival is a
tank-top it goes from like a light
yellow always like a like a darker
orange e color and also has Springs at
the bottom and then I also got this
t-shirt right here it that is a rebel on
it's really cute it should say like a
flowy t-shirt but I had the cutout on it
so I had like the cutout from like the
neckline you know what they do right now
I don't know what that's called I'm
going to call it a neckline cutout I got
these shorts right here I didn't try
these on I wasn't sure if I liked them
but I do like them so like a mustardy
color and they don't have a zip or
anything till they're comfy which I love
those are just kind of casual shorts you
can wear out for summer and then I also
got up here of then I'm sure these are
acid wash with some little some rips on
them I love these these were on sale for
like $11 which is a really good price
for some good shorts they're really good
material they feel like high-quality
shorts
very impressed with these like I would
never think that these really from
forever 21 like these are really nice
and I got a lot more pairs of shorts
after reform or something like that I
also got these leaf pattern shorts these
are really cute because they just have
like a cool little like button they feel
very touristy as well but I love these I
think these are so fun and go with the
same type of shorts I got another pair
kind of like that but these have lemons
on them yeah you might have seen in
these in my boho hacks video
I love these okay I love fruit patterns
right now I don't know why I don't know
I just think they're really really cute
next I got these shorts which I never
thought these were shorts I would
typically pick up honestly when I saw
them like on the hanger I probably
wouldn't have bought them but they had
them on a mannequin and they paired them
with a belt that I'll show you in a
second and with the belt I thought it
was they were so cute the way you
carried on the mannequin I was like okay
I need those shorts so they sold me from
their mannequin good job forever 21 and
then I also got this brown belt with the
two little decals on them it also
actually has three of these little
decals
cute little buckle as well and is what
was paired on top of the shorts are on
the mannequin almost stabbed myself
what's about but I thought this was
really a fun belt really nice like this
is looked really like something you'd
get a really cool store right now looks
very trendy so
so next I got some stuff from agachi
which I mentioned them in my last whole
and I love their stuff I thought they
were just like an online boutique but
you guys let me know some of you let me
know that is actually a store in Chicago
kibou teach in Chicago which I thought
was really cool but anyways this is
quickly probably become my favorite
online place to shop because all their
stuff is really freaking cute
so first I got this black floral
bodysuit pretty much every topic got
from them was a bodysuit but anyways it
is black floral but also has a little
cutout like below the boob area with a
cute little time little bow really
pretty really soft material this one is
really soft very form-fitting so it
looks really nice but it also feels
really nice next I got this a kiss body
fit which is so friggin fun I love the
lips on this oh oh I love this one bring
me back to like my high school days and
I was like really cool and I thought
that I like was really edgy I used to
wear like his t-shirts all the time but
be honest like I didn't know a single
song from their band I don't know a
single song from kiss but I do love this
shirt and I do I mean I like I listen to
Good Charlotte a lot at that age that
count is anything like this I have no
idea but yeah I actually good Charlotte
with my jam though did you guys like
Cachola do still like a charlet I used
to like dance around in my room so don't
want to be you like every day oh my gosh
I miss
so one of you you next I got this a pink
or like a dark mafia bodysuit
this one has adjustable straps which I
love and then it's just like a playing
the mob except for this side it's got
like the lace up detail and the lace up
is so pretty it's very end right now and
then I got this black long-sleeve sure
this definitely isn't very summery rules
making me pale on screen it is not very
super summery because it's definitely
not like a for warm weather but it's
very very low-cut it also has long
sleeves so they have like slits on the
sleeves lift your arms so kind of pop
out I don't know it is also a bodysuit
with long sleeves and cute and I love
that even though it's not really like
for warm weather but I guess the word
it's like at nighttime or something
somewhere so I could be really cool for
an event very pretty elegant and fancy
unlike me and this next one was a little
sad truth of plain green body suit looks
Lamonica tank top it's got a cool little
wrap in the front because this just
looks like a casual tank top made into
another body save that but I still like
to spin a lot I just went a little too
low on my chest that made me feel like a
little um you know uncomfortable and
then this next body - from agachi is
also a little sad this one is really
really stinking cute very pretty yellow
with a floral pattern has a criss cross
in the front like on your bosom area the
only sad part is the buttons on this one
will not stay closed and I got to say it
first I thought maybe it was too small
but it's not it just it just doesn't
button properly and I looked at a piece
of buttons or just like a little like
Laurens then from agathi I also got
these shoes I love these really fun a
black sandals they have tons a little
fun a funky design but the next thing is
a little crazier for things that I wear
but I'm excited it is like this metal
looking type dresses rose gold the very
very seats obviously all have to wear
like a black Bobby's 200 or something
either way I think it would be really
fun for a photo shoot I mean I just
think it's so cool and I just had to
have it okay I don't know I'm not sure
help here yet but check my Instagram
soon because I'm going to make sure I
rock this is some kind of photo shoot
because how cute is this I don't know I
love it I'm going to make it work cat
from a gawky you just cute little bit
I I loved was a little like like the
little Jim the flowers in the front
super fun is a crossbody and it's
actually that's white in the back so I
was like two purses attached which I
thought was really interesting I didn't
think it was going to look like this
online knows more like I just left out
or just it's like one color I didn't see
the white part in the back on the
pictures online but I feel like it is
really cute and I'm still going to use
it I just didn't know it was going to
have this but I still love it
okay the last place I went was Hollister
now let me tell you a little story about
this I have a shop in Hollister and like
like ever I don't know if I've ever
really shopped there I'm sure I've been
knows once or twice in my life but it's
just not really my style however I was
walking through the mall and their
storefront looks really cute it looks
different than their typical normal
clothes and they had a huge sign
covering an entire window that said
entire store forty to sixty percent
offer this is not online this is in the
store
I know online people said there's just a
section with 40% off or 60% off spa in
this store there's a huge sign is that
entire store forty to sixty percent off
and then I looked closely to said
excludes perfumes and colognes I was
like okay so all they're closed at forty
or sixty percent off so I went into the
store and I got three things and I got
it to the register and nothing was forty
or sixty percent off so I thought she
just didn't put the discount another oh
I supposed to be 40 to 60% off and she's
like no sorry it's only specific things
I'm like the sign says entire store and
she's like yeah it means like there is
stuff in the entire store that's forty
percent forty fifty percent off but it's
actually just that section over there
and pointing to a section that had this
little video red sign a tiny red sign
this is 40 to 60% off I'm like that is
so misleading so misleading but honestly
I was already in line with these things
so I went ahead and paid for it paid for
it but I wish I had and I should have
just like stuck my my guns and said
never mind I don't want it but I don't
think I got like not embarrassed I just
like well I got like I think I got
anxious you know what I was like oh my
gosh what I do I guess I just pay for it
whatever I learned my lesson to make
sure I like really check next time I go
in their store but anyways the three
things I got our first this simple white
tank top it's pretty cute it's like
really flowy and has like a cute little
like
brizzy's called fretless at the bottom
oh my gosh wow what a blank I like that
they change their stuff a little bit in
the East has those big like logos like a
moose logo and a perk Romney or at least
a little seagull one for halter but
there's no logo on it which I like it
does they've also really tiny at the
bottom but that's fine and the next I
got this really pretty sure it's like
tie in the front it's got really pretty
belfry's it is long sleeves but very
like fitting material so you can
definitely wear this in the summer it's
almost like a sky cloud pattern you know
or may associate a blue tie dye pattern
I don't know but I'm calling it a cloud
sky pattern there's a lot of things that
I got from Hollister a shirt that I'm
wearing right now it just says all equal
which I thought was really cool I love
the colors on it I think it's very fun
t-shirt I don't have a lot of t-shirts
for casual things and I think if I tie
this up at the bottom with some jean
shorts I can make it really cute so I
thought I got this one I probably would
have got I definitely have got enough
either way if it wasn't on discount
because I loved this shirt yeah
