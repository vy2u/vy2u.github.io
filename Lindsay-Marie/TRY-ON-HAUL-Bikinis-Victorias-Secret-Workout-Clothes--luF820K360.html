welcome with your new today's video is
my part 2 to go fight all videos you see
part 1 pause this video and click on
Hilbert and go watch it I'll have the
link up here or down below basically
part 1 with all of my fashion stuff and
the Urban Outfitters Topshop and they
wear like that packs on that's like
double well but I decided to separate
into two parts because it was way too
long so part two is going to be all of
my sporty styling all my fitness stuff
or like workout clothes that I got from
Victoria's Secret and then also some
swimsuits that recently got and some
accessories so first I got a really cute
accessories from velvet caviar I am
literally obsessed now so I saw Carli
bybel with its own cake and it's like
you know kind of Mean Girls Carli bybel
gets a phone case I gotta get the phone
case too so I got three things in their
site I'll show you what I got
first oh my gosh I got this really cute
oh my gray velvet hat so poop or puzzle
over oh yeah I might wear this
irresolutely
whoever I got was the holographic
glitter horse on there it doesn't say
the name of it on here but I'll put it
on the screen so you can go find it and
I'll show you an up-close don't worry
this is the holographic glitter hearts
it's like so cool can you shake it in
the cooler goes everywhere and it's
whole frickin concludes my favorite cuz
it like goes with my nails it's just I
love it oh my god is the violin marble
wine so this is the one that I saw like
Carli bybel had it and I was like I have
to have that one super duper T it goes
really nice with everything it's a
really pretty color looks great on my
phones great for selfies and it's good
for a gift to me a really cute container
of perfume let me show you a plenty all
about this basically you get a cool
little container like this and pick out
the colors if you want to match your
personality and then you can twist it up
and out comes a bio of perfume now sin
free space create subscription service
for high in perfume you pay 4095 a month
that's it no shipping no shipping cost
and also you can cancel whenever you
want and basically what the same is is a
high-end perfume at a monthly trial
service kind of no size on vehicle
dealer more that a monthly is the were
so I feel this to be the last
two months I think you definitely get a
lot of products for 1495 the thing is
for that price you're getting to try out
tons of different perfumes like Gucci
Prada net put Juicy Couture you know
Jimmy Choo whatever you want and get to
try all different perfumes versus
spending one really high cost for one
perfume this way you smelled it all the
time for all different perfumes find out
really what you want instead and you
know it's fun so yeah
Sanford oh we got three classes from
relic figa I'll probably say what's
wrong Rosie just released ago I probably
seen her on real realistic out bikinis
on the say okay anyways they got
probably Q to some fantasy I need to
suppose that I got active college from
course tomatoes like oh my gosh I have
to have that I got it Bluto this is a
really good smoke seems like a high net
if it is it like a menace mess material
really pretty really beautiful in light
blue and then it comes with these bottom
there was a scrunchie but I also got a
really pretty black home is really
simple black so sue is also got a really
cooling lace-up designs I really think
like adds a lot to your swimsuit makes
it in the center pendants a plain black
some so you gotta plan back like a suit
would salute anyway I got this really
pretty pink one has a really nice white
lace detail I love the white I feel like
it's really like pretty in the
summertime makes you look tan then it's
got be pink and white like spirally
striped straps and in the bottoms are
pretty much the same they've got the all
the same like lace detail and then also
the same straps and then the thorium of
which might actually be my second
favorite it is really pretty floral on
its like a blue and red blue light red
floral thing this is absolutely gorgeous
got a little hint of yellow and pink on
there it's a ruffles all around the
swimsuit which i think is really cute
and the bottoms are like tie bottoms
like that and it's also the same pattern
but it also has like a little like
ruffle the bottoms I think these are
really cute these are called cheeky that
was called like a cheeky bottom but I
love it today and I went to Victoria's
Secret never had engaged in my annual
sale and they stopped this stuff in a
bag I got a lot and they just say it's
the Philip cake now everything I got was
bored away or like workout clothes I
realized I was running out I had the
same stuff for a while so forget about
them
playing a black workout shorts or like I
guess a pussy called a shoes workout
shorts I lost the band and of the bsx
band superset ball but these are just
like a staple they can wear them with
any of my fourth draw and then I got an
outfit this is really really cute black
gray McWhite it's almost look with a
marker pattern you know the felt it
talents I don't have to know what they
would call it but kind of a great pink
band and then the top and the same
obviously with the same pattern and then
the same like pink fan I really love
this is a combo but knowing me also a
mix and match them as well because lazy
and I also got this pink line super like
highlight or bright pink with neon but I
love our gym where I feel like with
everyday clothes you never see anyone
wearing like this brightest stuff when
it comes to workouts off you couldn't
just like you can just go out there the
next our stores like that are black and
purple I really love the most pink on
camera but relax where is purple I love
this shade of like some addition of
purple you can see the little pink on
camera
anyways okay these are called hot shorts
Oh interesting hot shorts okay but they
are black on the back and then I also
got another sports bra this was followed
my favorite I love this so it's just
black and white with chevron stripes and
then it's just simple there's no whining
and b-side you have to wear like on fit
like a little padding underneath I don't
have to but I feel like no one wants to
- to the gym so I'm probably will and
I'll ask about these I got this one
which I'm really cool is black and white
pattern and which would call that but
it's got this really colorful Squires
eye as well so this one is really gonna
be standout it you guys laughs

part one was so put together I was so on
it and it's like part two key for home
