you happen to be new today's video
coming at you with another haul I do too
many of these I know I can't help it I'm
like new clothes it's a problem I'm
working on it and I'm not working on it
too well but going after with another
haul hopefully you guys are excited stop
clapping so loud I've got tons of
different stuff to show you from all
different places and I'm excited so yeah
so first up I have some things I bought
online from eggie okay so first thing I
got was this set it's the Trunchbull
skirt and then the Trunchbull I think
hopefully I'm saying that right
Trunchbull top now it doesn't have to be
a set you can buy them separately but I
really liked the way it looked as a set
so I got the top in the bottom then I
also got this Aggie t-shirt I think it's
called like the blurry huh of a tag on
it so like the blurry baby shirt or
something like that I will have
everything linked down below but um love
this it's definitely like an oversized
on purpose t-shirt but I like that
really like that like slouchy casual
casual and cool look another one is this
oversize long tee with a little star
print in that you know what area but
it's so cute I actually wear this on
Instagram and got a ton of compliments
another thing you've probably already
seen on my Instagram is this top right
here so it is a tank top but it's got
really cool like checkered strap which i
think is really fun i love like the pop
of the checkered nests on the straps
okay so this next item I wasn't really
sure if I was gonna love so it came
looks like this and is like a plaid
dress with blue polka dots really big
agbell type sleeves now I knew I was
gonna love the dress part itself I just
wasn't sure how I would feel about the
sleeves when I was on but honestly I
don't really mind it normally I wouldn't
pick something out with sleeves like
this that's just my typical preference
um but I do like it I like the way it
looks I'm not sure but something I could
wear all the time but I feel like maybe
first
special occasion it would be something
fun and different and last from aggie I
got one last dress this black slip dress
right here very similar to the tank top
I got like the same type material the
same slouchy type look except for this
one has chains for the straps oh my gosh
how cool is this I will say though the
chains are getting cold if you live in a
cold climate because I haven't worn this
dress once or twice already but it is
still really really pretty and then you
know I had to get some stuff from a
fashion OVA one thing I love about
fashion OVAs I feel like their stuff is
designed to make you look good you know
it's like definitely like confidence in
bringing about clothing which I like so
first thing I got this denim jumpsuit
it's not they're called jumpsuits but I
did wearing this on Instagram already
and got so many compliments this might
be the favorite my favorite thing I got
oh how it looks on very form-fitting
definitely gives me the appearance of a
bootie and then I have this a grey
t-shirt crop top it's got a cute little
pocket and really cool fun neckline up
here just something simple to throw on
but you guys know I love stuff like that
this next time I'm really excited about
and this is like a hoodie dress it also
has checkered sleeves I have a hoodie
kind of like this and why except for
it's just a hoodie so this will be a
dress instead of for me really really
fun again probably with my dog so like
some combat boots and then I also got
this skirt right here it is like a what
does it say
trendy trendy chick you know that's
chick or chic on this one there's a case
oh let's chick right
faux leather black and white stripe
skirt this is so cool I don't really
have anything too much like the 10 X I
have a a plain white tank top Otacon
suit which I love tucking things and so
that makes it perfect it's got the cool
little pull zipper that's on a lot of
things right now and it's soft next I
just have this is button-up long-sleeve
a crop top it actually goes over the
shoulder and it's a crop top but a
buttons up in the front I also just got
this white tank top right here I love
the straps if they had something a
little bit more fun to it looks like you
almost have like one of those cool
strappy bra lats underneath and then I
just got this a planned black t-shirt
that it does a tie at the bottom in the
front I have tons of shirts like this
from fashion OVA I've worn up ton of
them
Instagram on here just cute very soft
casual t-shirts that they're on which is
like literally my favorite thing ever
so got another over-the-shoulder crop
sweater this one is stripes what is like
I said more color but this is like a
neutral colored neutral toned striped I
really like this I believe this is
really really pretty I saw this actually
on their Instagram and I was like oh
that is so pretty I need it and then I
got this dress right here it says it's a
chip off the old block dress I don't
know what I want this pattern is called
it give me like clueless vibes though I
love that it is very form-fitting a
definitely looks really good on
I also into vans and grab this shirt
that I'm wearing right here it's just a
plain like maroonish t-shirt that says
like vans a girl game
I did get some shoes from bands that I
really really wanted and these are like
the old-school like high-top sneakers
thought they're cold I don't know oh but
I love them these are so cute and then I
went to packs on and I got a few shirts
the first one I got is just this black
t-shirt says star-crossed lovers cool a
little sunshine on it I basically got it
for the sunshine so the second shirt
that I got from PacSun I didn't even try
this one on until now just because I saw
it and I was like oh I like that I'll
just grab it it's just this like little
wave shirts got a little outline of a
wave a pretty simple flame t-shirt to
throw it on with some jeans yeah and
last but not least I got this t-shirt
right here which this looks honestly
like a t-shirt I could find in any store
so sometimes when I get stuff like this
on Mike Lindsay come on this was $25 and
it is really cute on I really like it
but it looks like a t-shirt it just
looks like a plain t-shirt you know it's
just just a plain t-shirt but it's 25
bucks but you know hey if it makes you
