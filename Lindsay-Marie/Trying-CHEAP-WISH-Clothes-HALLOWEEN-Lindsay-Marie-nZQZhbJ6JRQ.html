don't think it's cute that's okay but I
think it's really captain hey guys and
welcome back to my channel or welcome if
you are new today's video is going to be
a testing wish Halloween costumes I
ordered all of the items like September
15th I was sitting around does it oh
that'd be a good video idea I'll go
ahead and order them now so that I'll
have them way early and I'll film it
like October 1st so I ordered the stuff
on September 15th it is now October 17th
there might be the 18th and all of my
stuff just arrived from the within the
past two to three days oh also I have a
ton of mown sment so make sure to stay
till the very very end for some
announcements thank you very much
alright let's get started okay so the
very first thing my recording yes I am
okay so it's open the first item this is
a pretty jacket that's so on hold on
okay so here is the first item this is a
pink lady jacket let me just give like
an initial overview I mean it definitely
looks like it cost six oh okay so first
first you what is can you see that
there's definitely like dirt or mold or
something on the sleeve other than that
the thought definitely looks cheap but I
feel like I couldn't complain about the
font looking cheap when it was you know
six bucks this is actually really soft
so it's actually pretty soft it's
actually kind of cozy I don't feel kind
of nervous with like the mold on this
please it's pretty cozy pretty soft I'm
actually impressed with that and no
Tyrael looks fine like you could easily
wear this out for Halloween it feels
better quality than some items I've
gotten off of likes a fool or wrong way
to be honest so like not too bad you can
clean off the arm so I think for six
dollars I wouldn't complain okay so this
next clock so it says Halloween costume
voodoo doll but says it's still not
gonna be until November first this was
the last thing to arrive it arrived
yesterday this one was the most
expensive it was ten dollars it's
supposed to represent this little voodoo
girl but that's supposed to be the
costume that's what it's supposed to
represent okay this looks a little
interesting let's see how this goes
sure okay so I will say it's not that
bad there are some things I noticed that
are not exactly like the photo again the
photo I had like stitching like fake
stitches all across like like all the
waistline that is not there and also a
show with like a red and black skirt
it's just like one of those like poofy
what are those things like a tutu type
thing Joan with something like that but
it's more of just like a piece of red
lace instead so I think what they did is
they found a picture of a costume and
they tried to recreate it is what it
seems like it's not that bad I mean
Halloween is one night so I'm like but
I'm also someone who was really broke
growing up and up until I just like
before YouTube took off for me like up
until like a year or two ago like I
could really afford to buy a Halloween
costume back then so like for me if I
couldn't afford a normal costume but I
had ten dollars I wanted to be mad about
this I would say for ten dollars I would
be okay with it now is it going to be
exactly like the photo no but will it
work for a Halloween costume
absolutely this would work for a
Halloween costume so I'm just being
honest with ya it's like you could make
this cute okay who was texting me it's
called hot Pokemon Pikachu one thing
it's not hot
um this is it was $10 this was delivered
the first was the first item I got now
unfortunately this has already been
opened because no one could listen to me
when I said not to open it I had to so
many people they're like oh my god I am
Pikachu wants you just open it I was
like no no no I'm doing that for a video
and nobody listened I'm not gonna name
names but you know who you are and I
still love you but you know who you are
right let's try this on I'm being
annoying let's try this by the way I can
I tell you for ten bucks this is a
pretty bomb onesie and I'll be I've
never seen a Pokemon episode in my
entire life
judge me all you want at a button my
neighbors that they're watching now
hello are you getting that nice view of
me and my Pokemon one day are these
supposed to be pockets oh my gosh it has
pocket I didn't realize that I think it
runs a little slow I don't think it's a
so like cut off into the ankle but I'm
not mad about that I kind of think
that's cute if I work with some tennis
shoes on how we use another button right
here and I think you're supposed to I
think you're supposed to button that so
I would say go on the side but if you
get it just not still cute it's comfy
and it's soft like I completely sleeping
this all the time when it comes with a
cute little like head piece I'm digging
it oh my gosh wait a minute I just
noticed it has a butt flap
oh no everything I was robbers had but
laughs okay next item $10 this is the
women fashion is called women fashion
sexy mermaid party mermaid okay okay
guys another costume do you see this
okay now I just thought that why have I
not considered being the little mermaid
for Halloween I have red hair and I am a
little Merman I can't swim but I'm a
little wormy oh this is so cute I'm like
just spin it around the princess I think
it's pretty good quality like it's not
again it's not like a prom dress tale
but if you're looking for a quick
costume not quick take that back you
looking for a cheap costume and you
order it with enough time oh my gosh I'm
so low first I'm like fangirling over
this costume
that doesn't that I honestly might use
this for like a little mermaid costume
oh my god okay I'm so in like I think
it's cute but if you don't think it's
cute that's okay but I think it's really
kept okay guys so the very last thing
these are bloody tights these are one
dollar could be like a really cool like
bloody schoolgirls like a bloody
cheerleader all have bloody cheerleader
with these I'm not mad about it
I'm glad about it again I feel like
these are fine for a dollar you didn't
have to pay for shipping obviously but
like these are cute now you probably
when it comes to these kind of things
when it comes to accessories you
probably could buy these same socks at
like Party City for a dollar but overall
I think I was expecting to not like all
this stuff merch for a cheap costume
that doesn't cost a lot of money you
could literally obviously get something
pretty good pretty decent on a wish now
I don't know if you have time to buy
something cuz the shipping did take a
good while some items were here in two
weeks
some items we're here in three similar
to the whole month so I'm just a buyer
beware and be careful make sure you have
ample amount of time before buying
things hope you guys enjoyed it did you

favorite also tell me in the comments
