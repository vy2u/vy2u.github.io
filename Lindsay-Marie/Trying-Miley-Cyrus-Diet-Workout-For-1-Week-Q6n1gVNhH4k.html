happen to be new today's video I am
trying out Miley Cyrus's diet and
workout routine Miley Cyrus as you might
probably already know is completely
vegan and for the most part she is a
pretty gluten free it also does a lot of
Pilates and yoga as her main two
workouts real quick before we get
started today's video is sponsored by

there's no payout minimum so you can

really awesome I've had so much fun on
top cashback I've already saved so much
money on things I was going to purchase
anyways so I will have the link to top
cashback down below so make sure to
check them out now day one starts at
lunch time because I didn't realize I
was filming this video until like 11:00
a.m. but I went for a rice bowl with
tofu obviously rice garbanzo beans
peppers and then for dinner I tried out
my very first beyond me burger with some
black beans corn peppers spinach now I
did like the way this tastes I will be
honest but it definitely needed like
some mustard I had to add some
condiments anyone else love mustard
however I am NOT a huge fan of the way
the beyond burger smells I kind of
thought it's not like cats food or
something like canned cat food I don't
know it made our apartment smell pretty
bad but it did taste pretty good I don't
know anyways for my workout I found out
that Miley actually does the Mauri
Windsor's Pilate class now I found tons
of the Mari Winsor Pilate videos on
YouTube that I will link down below so I
just followed along one of her videos I
definitely need to work on this this is
my first Pilates class or video ever I
doesn't need to work on my back it was
so tight I couldn't do much of the
rolling but I think I did pretty well it
was actually really fun and it was
pretty hard now PS I did have tons of
snacks as week that I forgot to film
just so you guys know I filmed most of
my meals but I did miss like some of
them because I'm human I forgot I'm not
a very good
day two I had a huge a green smoothie
that I put way too much cinnamon in
which is totally my fault
and I also made a mess with it I make a
mess with everything now I did put
oatmeal in this smoothie and my oatmeal
was knock Lewton free but like I said
she does have gluten occasionally and I
was really hungry so I did it anyways
and then I also had a banana afterwards
because I was still hungry for lunch
that night I had the same tofu barbecue
bowl as before they were I'm said
they're just so good and then we bake
some eggplant and had a salad for dinner
then also Noah picked up these vegan
cookies from a local vegan bakery here
in Columbus oh my gosh they were so good
if any of you guys live in Columbus
definitely check out patty cake bakery
delicious now for my workout I went to
our gym and followed along with a yoga
video I also am signing up for a yoga
class later in the week that you guys
will hear more about later on I'm not
too great at bouncing or downward dogs
this was my very first time but hey I
was trying I totally crashed when I got
back but I did have a protein bar and a
lot of water day three I just had some
fruit and these vegan gluten-free sweet
potato pancake things from Whole Foods
but they were so good oh my gosh guys
I'm obsessed I'm gonna buy these all the
time totally good with cinnamon on them
as well and for lunch I made a buffalo
wrap with tempeh this is my first time
having tempeh and I loved it
so good and we also had a sweet potato
with it then for dinner I didn't dinner
we had with some sauteed mushrooms
squash and a real good arugula salad and
these vegan gluten-free sprinkles I've
seen maile tons of these and I found
them at Whole Foods and then for my
workout I did a mix of yoga and Pilates
this night I followed a quick ten minute
yoga video and a 20 minute Windsor
Pilates video day four had another super
green smoothie with so much kale in it
it was not the best but it was good for
me and it was doable then I had a bigger
version of my tofu bowl for lunch
because your girl was hungry and
honestly these tofu bowls were just so
good I had been way too much this week
and then I met my friend for dinner who
was actually already vegan and she
showed me this delicious vegan place
where has like a place that like lots of
vegan options and I had the yummiest
vegan Greek food and the cheese did
taste a little weird I'll be honest but
it was totally doable and
definitely gonna go back and it was
delicious it was also my first time
having falafel guys falafel is so good
then I went to the jamot later that
night and did another of the Windsor
Pilate videos still working on my rolls
as you can tell but I am definitely
starting to see more definition in my
stomach this day Dave I had a huge
smoothie with tons of fruit and veggies
and those same sweet potato hash browns
not pancakes oops
with my coffee and what do you know I
had another tofu bowl for lunch I'm
sorry I just really loved them for my
workout I actually went to a yoga class
this day and I couldn't film it but it
was really fun I also had a yummy salad
later on with a whole avocado tomato
carrots arugula spinach other stuff in
some balsamic and then on this day I
fell down a flight of stairs I was
walking my dogs and it was like a little
cold I think I like that the grass was
wet outside and I was wearing my
slippers and I slid down the stairs and
then I cried for a good half hour and my
foot was pretty swollen but my sweet
fiance brought me some almond milk and a
protein bar and I pretty much just laid
in bed the rest tonight so day six is
actually my last day I put in the
curlers the night before so wow I look
really unattractive I woke up and my
foot was pretty painful to walk on and
found out I fractured my big toe and I
couldn't work out for at least two weeks
when it when it came to my foot at least
add my favorite soaked dark chocolate
coconut yogurt with a banana and I had a
snack later with a bunch of fruit with a
side of dog hair stuck to it oops that's
disgusting
then we made another tofu plate except I
ate half of it before I remembered to
fill and then for dinner since this was
my last day my day off we went to this
local vegan place and I got a buffalo
vegan tempeh wrap and we had fried
pickle chips with vegan ranch now
obviously this was not a healthy meal
but hey life is all about that balance
and I'm so grateful I gave this a shot I
don't think I will stay gluten free
after this but I have decided to take
the plunge and stay 100% vegan happy
with the results from this I will again
have all the sources down below
