channel today's video is a 180 day
healthy and vegetarian version hope you
guys enjoyed this video let's go ahead
and get started so to start off my
morning around 8 a.m. I like to make
some coffee now I like the Dunkin Donuts
french vanilla it's not the healthiest
version but hey it makes me happy in the
morning so I'm not changing that and
then I like to add in a little bit of
creamer the creamer I use is really
sweet so I don't need any extra sugar
and then I was writing my planner for
about 30 minutes until I am fully woken
up I don't like to start off my morning
immediately making breakfast so this
will just kind of wake me up and get my
day started and then around 8:30 a.m. I
am ready to make some food so this
morning I decided to fry two eggs and
then make two pieces of toast I'm
topping one piece of toast with Swiss
cheese and one with pepperjack and then
I'm going to top both of those with my
eggs and then I'm going to cut up in
Alba Caro and I'm going to put one half
of the avocado on top of my toast and
I'm just going to top both pieces with a
little bit of pepper just for taste and
that is it for my breakfast and then to
go with it I did have a big glass of
water I try and drink as much water as
possible throughout the day so I always
try and drink water with my meals
and now it's time for lunch and I wanted
something a little bit sweeter so I
decided to go for a yogurt parfait now
your typical lunch is just typically
more of a breakfast food but that's okay
so I started off with a little bit of
you
vanilla Greek yogurt I love the stuff
and then I'll add in like two or three
handfuls of granola the granola is
probably my favorite part and then I
will top it off with blueberries
blackberries and strawberries or just
whatever fruit I have at the time and
that was it for my lunch and then again
I had a big glass of water and then a
few hours later I'll be ready for snack
so this particular day I decided to make
a cup of hot green tea cuz it's a little
cold where I live and then I also
decided to have some dry apples because
they are actually really inexpensive I
just got them at Walmart and they taste
so good
but I really love dried fruit in general
it's a lot better for you and it gives
you like that sweet fulfilling ness that
you're wanting I'm sowing like half a
bag of you sometimes Knoll I drink my
green tea and then I will wait until
dinner around 6:00 p.m. and this
particular day I decided to cut up some
broccoli an entire green pepper because
I was really hungry
I also added in some mushrooms and I
decided to add all three three of these
into a pan with some olive oil and a
little bit of low-sodium soy sauce just
for some taste I'm going to cook all
three of these in the pan for about five
to ten minutes and then I'm also going
to boil some butternut squash now I love
butternut squash um so I'll just add
like a good bit of it into like a like a
sauce pan with a little bit of water and
boil it for about five minutes and then
on my plate I added my butternut squash
my sauteed vegetables or whatever you'd
like to call what I just did they also
decided to add some power greens which
would just spinach kale and bok choy and
I topped that with a little bit of
balsamic vinegar and that was it for my
dinner oh and of course I did have
another glass of water
