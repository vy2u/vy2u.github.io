everyone's busy because everyone has a
life but me oh my god I'm so bored uh hi
guys welcome back to my channel if you
are new then welcome and if you are new
not new then welcome back see I'm doing
8 what to do when you're bored because
we all know we get to these little
states of mind when we are just so bored
we just don't know what to do with
ourselves because oh so today I'm going
to give you my insight on what I like to
do when I'm bored and then you guys can
leave in the comment section and tell me
what you like to do when you're bored
because if we all leave comments on what
we like to do when we're bored then
we're never going to be bored again
because we're just gonna have a billion
ideas to do when we're bored so get on
that also before you start watching my
video
Wow our movements Lindsay this is a clap
video with my good friend Rachel Lee she
is from Australia how cool is that I
wish I was from Australia but I'm not
because I'm not that cool um she is also
going to be doing a what's new in your
board video but she's going to be doing
a healthier version so um she's gonna be
doing like good things to do for your
life when you're bored so I definitely
think you should go and watch that she
makes really great videos she's vegan so
she makes a lot of like vegan food idea
videos and everyone loves those videos
so you know you want to watch them she
makes funny videos makes beauty video
she made kind of everything so
definitely make sure you're done
watching my video to go ahead and check
out her video you won't regret it I will
also make sure to link her video at the
end of this video and down below so
without further ado let's get started
numero uno is to practice something that
you suck at that you don't want to suck
at any longer like let's be real my
eyebrows are the anti fleek and I don't
want my eyebrows to be the anti fleek
anymore I mean I don't know if I'll ever
be able to get them sleeked
but I like to get them semi fleet so I
have been using my perfect brow set by
flawless face lately and I've been
really really practising my brows
whenever I'm bored like super bored
because I'm not like someone who really
like loves makeup or anything because I
suck at it
but whenever I'm super bored I like to
pull it out and practice my eyebrows
because I
like if I just keep using this perfect
brow set and keep practicing my eyebrows
for so long
eventually they might be semi flaked and
then that'll be a world transformation
for me so practice something that you
know you want to get better at that
you're not too good at yet there's so
many different things if you want to get
good at photography if you want to get
good at editing you couldn't get good at
homework if you want to get good at
anything practice it and eventually
you'll get it because practice makes
perfect well maybe not perfect cuz these
brows are never gonna be perfect but
practice makes better
number two is to bake something because
we all like food and we all like to eat
something we all like sweet stuff so
bake something oh my can be whatever you
want it doesn't actually sweeps up it
can be like damn food right it doesn't
matter um
bake something for your parents if they
work all day that's super sweet bake
something for your boyfriend or your
girlfriend bake something for your
friends bake something for yourself
because you deserve it I mean what I'm
really bored I like to think of
something that I want to eat that I
typically don't know myself eat all the
time I'm like all right you know what
let's do it
cook it put in the oven do whatever you
gotta do make something eat something
mmm number three Netflix movies binge
watch now it is a good thing I actually
read somewhere on Oprah one time that it
is a good thing sometimes to just take
time to watch movies and do stuff that
you like to do and just be calm so it's
good or every now I'm not saying this
all the time but when you're seriously
bored you have nothing to do it's okay
to binge watch Netflix or Hulu or
whatever you want to watch I'm typically
lifetime but I watch all of it so find a
new TV show I'll find a new movie in
this binge watch the heck out of it
until you're not bored anymore and then
Oh number 5 is to store a DIY project
DIY projects takes so much time they
take effort they're fun you're doing
something creative and get your juices
flowing and you're not bored anymore I
actually recently did a DIY DIY clothing
video it was like a spring clothing
video so if you are looking for a new
DIY project to upcycle or recycle your
clothing I will link that somewhere over
here and at the bottom at the in my
description bar as well so you have sort
DIY project there's so many different
things you can do I love the new DIY
clothes I just did because I had so many
clothes I needed to get rid of like girl
bye but I said I said girl stay here and
I'll recycle you and make you cuter and
so save some money number 6 is sort of
like a DIY project with certain
inspiration board there's nothing better
than being inspired and getting
motivated to do the things you want to
do now this is something you can create
hands-on with pictures and stuff that I
let you like personally wanting to get
inspired motivated I like to make an
online inspiration board you can use
tumblr you can use Pinterest you can
make a blog number seven is to exercise
there's no better time oh sleepy dog
there's no better time to exercise them
when you're bored because you don't want
to do it when you're not bored so why
not do it when you are bored you can
even do it in your own living room I
have an entire workout motivation video
that I will link down below if you
haven't seen it it's so many different
ways to workout without having to leave
your home without having to go to the
gym so many fun things you can do at
home so if you're bored just pop in
front of the TV and exercise that's so
easy and you're not gonna be as bored
any month as much you can even do your
binge watching Netflix and exercise
together
kill two birds with one stone and then
you've been watching and exercising so
you don't feel as bad about it number
eight I think this is number eight I
might have gotten out of order pamper
yourself there's nothing wrong with just
pampering yourself this kind of goes
along with the baking and watching movie
thing but just edits it around do a hair
mask do a face mask paint your nails
paint your toenails do whatever you want
to do that makes you feel good whiten
your teeth pamper yourself I love paper
days like when I'm bored I will have a
full-on freakin DIY pamper day I also
just
a DIY pamper video that is all DIY you
don't really need to go buy anything I
will link that down below or somewhere
on the screen go watch that if you need
to pamper day because pampering yourself
is a great thing to do you deserve
having a day when you just feel good
about yourself and feel refreshed and
new pamper the crap out of yourself if
you're bored and my very last DIY is to
clean your room we all know it might not
even be your room we all know we have
one of those rooms it just needs it just
needs to be done like my room needs to
be clean my bathroom needs to be clean
my closet needs to be cleaned so I
probably shouldn't be mean talking right
now I should probably be cleaning
instead of making this video but just go
do it clean your room clean your bedroom
that's the same thing get it done
because we all know your mom your dad
your roommate your sister your brother
your friends they're gonna be happy
you're gonna be happy because you're
gonna be able to find all the stuff
you've been looking for that we all know
it's not really lost at your thing is
lost but it's really just under that
pile of clothes in your room go clean
your room and maybe actually I'll go do
the same thing because well I don't
clean mine in a while how these ideas
help you and I hope it like cures your
boredom a little bit let me know in the
comments all the things that you do when
you're born so with that we're all
really not bored um thumbs up this video
