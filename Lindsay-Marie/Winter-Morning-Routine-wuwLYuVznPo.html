guys and welcome back to my channel it's
probably not really morning when you're
watching this but that's okay
so today's video is my winter morning
routine let me know if you guys want to
see a winter night routine and I can do
that too
like I said these are kind of always the
same so I feel bad but what am I
supposed to do I love you guys so much I
hope you enjoyed this video make sure to
check out all of my social media and
stuff linked below also I'm doing a huge
huge iPad Mini giveaway and like some
other things for the holidays are doing
a huge holiday giveaway so at the end of
this video make sure to check out my
holiday giveaway I will have it linked
down below without further ado let's go
ahead and get started so typically on a
winter morning especially if I'm on a
winter break and I don't have school or
work I'll probably sleep in just until
my dogs waked me up or just Wilma I just
wake up on my own so the nice waking up
to puppy dog kisses don't you think and
then obviously I will check to my phone
my Instagram my Twitter and my youtube
and sometimes my snapchat I will have
all that link to down below if you'd
like to follow me I would typically sit
on my phone for at least 30 minutes
that's terrible I know but hey at least
I'm being honest with you guys why you
in the strong bitch and then I will
finally get out of bed and head into the
kitchen to make some coffee first I
decided to put on my robe actually put
this on every single morning get super
cozy it keeps me like extra warm because
it is a little chilly even though I keep
it warm in my house but just because
it's a cold outside it's still a little
bit colder in the mornings so put on my
robe and then I'm heading into the
kitchen to make myself some coffee now
no matter how late I wake up I still
have to make my coffee every morning now
I love instant coffee don't make fun of
me but it is so good so I make myself
instant coffee and then yeah that's what
I'm doing
for my coffee I just use these folders
and - coffee mix the terrain even LLC up
in a little bit of 2% milk sometimes
don't use creamer but this time I just
use milk it's just it kinda depends on
what I have honestly and then while my
coffee is cooling off I will go ahead
and go and do my skincare and brush my
teeth so I brush my teeth first but then
I'm going in with my exposed skin care
my skin has gotten gotten kind of worse
recently because of the winter season
now exposed skincare combines advanced
acne medicine with pure natural extracts
like green tea which really helps -
which really helps to heal your acne
while improving your skin tone and it's
also not harsh on your skin and the
great thing is it's great for people
with sensitive skin sort of like me who
get like the occasional acne but it's
also really good for people who have
more severe or like teenage acne um an
expose is actually a really nice cup
company and they're really confident
that you know you're gonna love your
products like give me a one year
guarantee
and also we spend $40 or more you get a
microderm scrub and actually is the
microderm scrub all the time because it
really gives off all of my dry winter
skin so I pretty much just used all this
stuff every single morning and it's
really made a huge difference in my skin
I don't have any acne it kind of stops
the acne from performing it's also made
my skin like really smooth and soft and
I just had really really good like clear
skin tone I've just been loving this the
expose skin care has definitely changed
my skin and yeah I doesn't think we
should check it out I will have all the
links and everything linked down below
now I'm just going back into the living
room to drink my coffee and eat my
breakfast I'm just having to go this
morning because hey I was being lazy but
aren't we all
hey you know while I'm eating my
breakfast I will typically watch TV I
will sit on my laptop I'll check my
phone I'm kind of a busy bee in the
morning I'm just kind of checking all my
stuff I'm sort of all over the place
and that's I would move on to doing my
makeup I've typically been skipping a
foundation recently because my skin's
been pretty clear and I'm just using the
appear minerals new I think it's like
the Cameo stick it's basically just a
concealer and then a bronzer in one and
I just put this all over my face and I
use my damn Beauty Blender to it blend
it all out and then I'm gonna go in and
finish the rest of my makeup just kind
of simple everyday makeup and then I'm
also going to throw my hair up into a
bun and that is my completed look for as
simple everyday when to look
and in last for my outfit I chose to
switch to my roba for this really cute
sweater dress perfect for a for a winter
day for staying in or going out
I'll prepare with some thigh-high boots
if I leave the house today and that is
it for my winter morning routine that
