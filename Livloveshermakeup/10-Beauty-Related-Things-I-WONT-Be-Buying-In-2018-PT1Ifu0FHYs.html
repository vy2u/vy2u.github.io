my channel so today I'm gonna be sharing
with you guys 10 at Beauty related
things that I will not be buying in 2018
I couldn't exactly pinpoint who started
this particular video trend if you type
in this title on YouTube a lot of
different videos come up so I'll go
ahead and just throw a few up in the
cards of random ones because like I said
I'm not quite sure who exactly started
this video idea but I thought it was a
lot of fun some people were just talking
about like materialistic things that
they won't be buying in 2018 some people
were talking about specific and beauty
related things that they won't be buying
in 2018 and that's what we're gonna
focus on in this video so number one I
will not be buying and makeup removing
wipes this year it is just not something
I need in my life especially when I have
wonderful wonderful cleansing oils and
cleansing balms that I have absolutely
fallen head-over-heels in love with I
also have a hard time finding cruelty
free cleansing wipes so that is
definitely the first thing that I will
just not be buying I also find it very
wasteful and maybe not the greatest for
the environment I feel like I use a lot
of them at once I pull like tug at my
skin it's just not something I need in
2018 so no makeup remover wipes this
year next up is color correctors I have
noticed since a my skin has gotten very
very dry putting on a color corrector
than going in with a concealer and then
going in with the foundation is way too
much especially underneath of my eyes
just layering a more and more product on
my face is not looking as good as it
used to so definitely not going to be
purchasing any color correctors this
year if I need to use a color corrector
it's one that has like a built-in
concealer with it moving on to at number
three acne spot treatments I recently
went through my whole entire collection
and realized that I have the little
band-aid sticky things that you put on
your face as well as seven different
acne spots treatments and I used to use
them a lot when I had more combo oily
skin and I was breaking out a lot I held
on to these products if I do get pimples
it's just a few of them along my jawline
or hormonal acne you know that kind of
thing or it's a product that has been
irritating my skin so I already have
what eight or nine of them sitting
underneath my sink there's no way I need
to purchase any more of them this year I
need to get through those ones I need to
use them up and then maybe next year
I'll go ahead and I will repurchase the
ones that I liked the best alright guys
let's talk
eyelash serums I feel like none of the
eyelash serums like light lash or rapid
lash that I used to use our cruelty free
so I have switched to using a cactus oil
as well as castor oil on my eyelashes
and my eyebrows it is working just as
well you have to be very careful I
always dip it with a q-tip in and then I
will just kind of lightly dust it onto
the under part of my lashes as well as
the tops of my lashes and just right
through my eyebrows and then when I get
to the bottom lashes I kind of just go
towards the bottom
I'm not directly on the lash line
because you don't want to blind yourself
with oil but yeah there is no need of
where I left serums this year or really
ever ever again because I feel like oils
actually do the same exact thing for me
I really have been loving cactus oil I
find mine at Whole Foods and that has
been very very helpful for me as well
where I have some bald patches from my
lupus so yeah I definitely do not need
any sort of eyelash serums or eyebrow
serums this year alright let's talk
about eyeshadow singles I hate creating
my own palettes I hate eyeshadow singles
the only palette that I've really loved
that I've created myself is the touch of
glam Beauty eyeshadow single palette and
actually she kind of created it for me
because she's the one who sent it over
for PR but I just do not like creating
my own palette I know that's really
funny because I'm so picky when it comes
to actually reviewing eyeshadow palettes
but I just like a whole palette in one I
don't like having singles all over the
place I also rarely rarely reach for my
eyeshadow singles so I'm absolutely not
going to be purchasing any sort of
eyeshadow Singles this year it is a
waste for me I rarely reach for trios
duo as an eyeshadow singles so note to
those alright guys a makeup eraser
cloths from Sephora these are like the
$20 pink eraser clock that you used to
take off your makeup all you have to do
is run it underneath a warm water and
then you wipe it on your skin and it
really does a work and I do like it with
more oily cleansing balms however I
realized I have seven of them I don't
know how would they piled up to the
amounts that I have seven but washcloths
work just as well I don't need a $20
pink cloth to actually remove my makeup
it reminds me a lot of like a Beauty
Blender you know only $20 for a sponge
it's just not worth it and when I
already have eight that you can reuse
and you can rewatch I don't need any
more so no to the makeup erasers from
Sephora and note to makeup remover wipes
as well in general now the next one is
I cream and now I know I recently talked
about how he wanted to pick up the
banana bright eye creme from Ola
Hendrickson I'm not gonna do it
I've been using rosehip seed oil as my
eye cream lately or jojoba oil or any
sort of oil that I have in my collection
which I have so many of it and it works
just as well it works just as well any
moisturizer that you have that's I see
if you can take around your eye area I
don't notice a big deal or a big
difference when it comes to eye cream so
no more eye creams for 2018 not worth it
I don't need'em next up is facial oils I
have enough facial oil to last literally
probably the next three years so not
going to be purchasing any new facial
oils this year I had three that recently
went bad in my collection that were over
the forty dollar mark and it pissed me
off that was like almost $200 worth of
facial oil that went bad because it was
just sitting there in my collection and
I really really felt guilty about that
because I love facial oils I really
think they're precious and they're
beautiful and they do so much for your
skin and I just don't need more I have a
 ton a ton underneath my sink
right now I literally think I have 15
bottles of facial oil open right now
number nine is hairspray I've never been
a real hairspray girl and I find that
hairspray really really irritates my
scalp and I know that I recently did a
chop my hair off and I've been trying to
play around a little bit with hair spray
here and there just how to hear that
fella I've been trying to play around
with hair spray here and there but it
really really really irritates my scalp
I mean I'm itching I'm like getting
rashes on my scalp it's not for me it's
not the product for me I would much
rather use some sort of a dry shampoo
that has like a little bit of volume and
lift to it so no hair sprays this year
and finally sheet masks I know I feel
like there are sheet masks that I have
used before that did something for me
but for the most part sheet masks don't
do a lot for my skin I would much rather
purchase a really good at Masset I can
just squeeze out of a bottle and put on
because the sheet masks just don't do
what they do for other people some
people swear by them but for me I don't
like them I don't like putting them on
my face they usually don't fit my face
contour right and they're just not
something that I really see a difference
with so anyway guys those are 10 beauty
related products I will not be
purchasing in 2018 let me know if you
are not going to be purchasing any sort
of beauty related products down below
and I guess I'll see you guys tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
