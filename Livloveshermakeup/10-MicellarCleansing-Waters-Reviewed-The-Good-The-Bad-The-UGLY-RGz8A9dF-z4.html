channel thank you so much for joining me
as you can tell from the title today's
video is going to be the long-awaited
battle of the micellar cleansing water
z' I have 10 different micellar
cleansing water to talk about today with
you guys to share the good the bad and
the ugly we are going to start with my
favorite pics and then work our way down
to the ones that are not my favorite
just for a little bit of a reference I
am combo to oily skin so just because
some of these may work for you doesn't
mean they'll work for me and vice versa
so I'm just going to go ahead and go
through them and tell you guys which are
my favorite which ones I don't really
like which are just okay things like
that and yes I am not wearing makeup
today because I really want to make it a
point that when I do a skincare video
where I'm only talking about skincare I
don't wear makeup so I can actually show
you guys what my skin is looking like so
let's go ahead and jump right into it
the first micellar water I have here to
talk about is from simple this is my
all-time favorite micellar water I would
recommend this for all sorts of
different skin types I think it would
work for those of you who have mature
skin dry skin normal skin oily skin
combo skin anything this is the micellar
cleansing water that cleanses removes
makeup and hydrates the skin from simple
it is absolutely beautiful you do get
six point seven fluid ounces a product
in here for around seven or eight
dollars at the drugstore I feel like I
do go through this relatively quickly it
doesn't have as much product to say the
Garnier ones but it is absolutely
beautiful I feel like it takes off my
face makeup I can use it in the morning
to cleanse my face it doesn't strip my
skin of anything it can remove
waterproof eye makeup it literally can
do everything and this is my first
recommendation and my all-time favorite
cleansing water alright my second pick
is definitely the Garnier skin active
micellar cleansing water in the pink cap
version this is the sensitive skin
version I have gone through five tubs of
this this is my latest one this one is
about the same price as the simple one
however you do get 13.5 fluid ounces of
product in here so if you are just
trying out a cleansing water and you
want a good bang for your buck I would
highly recommend checking out the
Garnier versions so this one is supposed
to cleanse refresh and remove all sorts
of face makeup lip makeup and I makeup I
do not find that this irritates my eye
area like the simple one or anything
like that well what I mean is the simple
one does it your day by eye area
I feel like this is just as good as the
simple one is what I'm trying to say
however I will say this one maybe has a
little more cleansing properties I don't
feel like it leaves me feeling very
hydrated in the skin the simple one does
leave a little bit of something there
this will completely strip off like all
the oils and things like that so I don't
actually think I would recommend this
for dry skin mature skin or sensitive
skin but if you have normal comp or oily
skin this is a really really good pick
the next one I want to talk about is
from Pacifica
I love the Pacifica brand if you guys
didn't know they are cruelty free and
100% vegan I believe this is an Ulta
exclusive that is where I purchase mine
this is the kale water micellar
cleansing tonic so this actually has
glycolic acid infused into it so it is
going to brighten and tone your skin it
does remove stubborn makeup and it
rinses free like a cleanse basically so
I do like this I would not personally
use it to remove all of my face makeup
or my eye makeup I actually like to use
it to remove residual skincare in the
morning so it's kind of like a morning
cleanse for me it does have a little bit
of a scent to it if you don't like the
scent of like green juice I don't think
you would like this it does kind of
smell like kale or spinach but it's
really really beautiful if you do have
oily or blemished skin so do not use
this around your eye area even though
they say you can because it does have
glycolic acid in it it's just not good
for like your eyebrow hair and your
eyelashes I would use this more as a
quick cleanse in the morning so if you
are looking for a good at micellar water
and you do have combo to oily skin and
you just want to cleanse your face with
it and not so much remove makeup this is
a really really good one the kale water
from Pacifica all right the next product
that I want to talk about is the L'Oreal
micellar cleansing water this is what it
looks like I recently picked this up and
I think it's pretty darn good it's it is
a complete cleanser that removes makeup
cleans dirt and oils it purifies and it
doesn't matter Phi because the version
that I got is normal to oily skin I
would not recommend this for sensitive
skin or even normal skin I really think
this is good for those of you with combo
to oily skin I don't like to use it too
much around my eye area because I do
notice that my eye lashes tend to fall
out with this that's how like cleansing
it is so I really only use this on at my
face makeup it takes off face makeup
beautifully if you are really oily I
think you would absolutely love this
they do have three different versions
they have a dry skin version they have a
sensitive skin version and then this
version so I think this one is also
pretty darn good and you do get let's
see her 13 point
five fluid ounces of product in there
all right moving on the next thing I
want to talk about are these simple
sensitive skin experts and my seller
makeup removing wipes so these are
basically just be my seller water in
white forms so I really like these a lot
I would not recommend them for those of
you who do have very very sensitive skin
which is kind of weird because simple is
made for those of you with sensitive
skin but these do have sort of like a a
wavy texture to them and I find that
when I'm rubbing and rubbing it does
start to make my skin a little red and
irritated so I would really only
recommend these for those of you would
dry a mature combo and oily skin I think
they are pretty darn good they do remove
my face makeup and my eye makeup quite
nicely if I start really really rubbing
around my eye area I do find that it
does get red and irritated but for the
most part if you do want a micellar
cleansing wipe this is probably the best
one that you can find on the market all
right another micellar cleansing wipe
right here is from Ulta these are the
makeup remover cleansing pads these are
hydrating no-rinse formula they are
infused with aloe and cucumber and I
don't love these I would not use these
on everyday basis however there are 30
pads in here and these are absolutely
perfect for travel so if you are someone
who is traveling and you don't want to
take your micellar water with you
because obviously sometimes that stuff
can break open in your luggage or
whatnot so these are a really good
option um I do notice that if I really
really start to use it on my face like I
did today this is what I did to kind of
take off my residual skincare this
morning I do get a little it's just to
sting around my nose area and it does
get a little raw and shaft and red so I
just wanted to throw that out there I
don't think they're that gentle but they
really do remove any sort of residual
anything on your face and they do feel
quite good so I like to take those when
I travel I really just reserved them for
when I travel and I believe you can get
30 pads like this for about 3 99 or
$4.99 which is a good price all right
the next one I want to talk about is
also from Pacifica this is the natural
beauty coconut water micellar cleansing
tonic it says it's for all skin types
especially stressed out sensitive skin I
would not recommend this for sensitive
skin this even makes my skin very red
and kind of stings my skin a little bit
I don't like this I would not repurchase
it it says it does rinse free uh you
know any sort of like anything on your
face that you may have this as a rinse
free cleanse it removes stubborn
up and it tones the skin I do not like
it nearly as much as I like the kale
water one it does smell very strongly a
coconut which does smell nice but it
feels a little overpowering so if you
are sensitive to fragrance do not get
either of the Pacifica micellar
cleansing water 'z but yeah I don't like
this that much and really don't think
it's very good it says that leaves you
refresh without over-drying but I
honestly feel like it does dry my skin
out so I would not recommend this one I
would only recommend the kale water one
and then here I have two the kind of
Thai for almost worst place this one is
the formula 1006 so totally clean and
then we have these young pure micellar
cleansing water we'll go ahead and start
with this one
this one is only 3 99 or $4.99 at Ulta
and I think the reason why it has such
high ratings on the website is because
it is so cheap this stuff had it's
filled with alcohol okay it's filled
with alcohol it really really burns the
skin it really irritates although it
doesn't have a lot of fragrance to it it
just is not helpful for removing eye
makeup especially it will sting your eye
area so this is not something I would
recommend if you are looking for a good
cleansing water just go ahead and pick
up with the Garnier one or the simple
spend the few extra bucks because you
only get 3.4 fluid ounces a product in
here and you can get doubled the size
for I mean is yes it is double the price
but those ones are worth it this is just
not worth it in my opinion it says its
gentle it cleanses the skin no rinsing
or rubbing but I don't know it really
really makes my skin feel raw and
irritated so I would not recommend this
one from Ulta these jumpier micellar
cleansing water and then to go along
with this that is the isn't it
to go along with that one summery all
over the place this is the formula 1006
so totally clean micellar cleansing
water this is the sensitive formula and
you guys will probably see I barely use
any of this and that is because I put
this on my face the first time and I was
like holy that feels horrible it
really really burns I don't like it at
all it made my eye area just burn like
crazy my eyes were watering it says
designed with a blend of botanical
extracts to nourish your skin this
fragrance read my cellar cleansing and
carries away dirt makeup and stubborn
pore clogging oils its gentle enough for
everyday use I do not agree with that
you do get 6.75 fluid ounces for about
$4.99 which is a great price and
normally I do like the products from
formula 1006 I think they make some
really really great mask but I am just
not impressed with this as far as like
cleansing purpose
not concerned and finally the last
micellar water i want to talk about is
the worst in my opinion it is the
Garnier skin active in the blue cat
version now this is bad for you if you
do have combo to oily skin if you have
dry skin or mature skin this is going to
be the micellar water you should pick up
so the reason why I don't like this is
because although it says it does not
have any sort of oils in there I don't
believe it because it literally has like
a dual facing so it looks like there's
oil floating on top and then the actual
cleansing solution there so you have to
shake it up it just left my skin so
incredibly oily I don't need more oil on
my skin it's already pretty oily as is
so this just did not work for me but if
you do have dry or mature skin I would
pick this one up instead of the pink cap
version so anyway guys those are my 10
reviews on my 10 micellar cleansing
water that I have tried out let me know
down below if you have tried any of
these which one is your favorite and
yeah that is it I will see you guys on
my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
