my channel today's video is going to be
all about ten different palates I wanted
to love but unfortunately did not you
are probably going to recognize these if
you have been watching my declutter
series I have five different face
palates five different eyeshadow
palettes all of these will be
decluttered before remove as you guys
are watching this video we have already
moved to Minnesota but I wanted to go
ahead and just walk you guys through how
I had good intentions for these palettes
and I'm not the kind of person that's
gonna drop my fucking money on something
that I'm not gonna end up like it these
are definitely palettes I thought I
would enjoy they are products that I
really really have high hopes for but
unfortunately things didn't work out the
reason I haven't decluttered these yet
is because I wanted to leave all my
declutter boxes open until we actually
moved and that's just because I'm one of
those people if when I move I want to
get rid of everything you know so we
have like the donation box open and also
a few boxes that I'm sending to my
friends but yeah I just wanted to go
ahead and get a little more in-depth on
why some of these pallets did not work
for me so let's go ahead and start with
the eyeshadow palettes I want to start
the whole video off with a color pop and
this is the golden state of mind
eyeshadow palettes I had extremely high
hopes for this because I'm a huge fan of
really really nice thick foiled shadows
I feel like violet vos and a few other
brands do this sort of formula very well
but when it comes to color pop even at
this price point I don't think they're
that good this was one of those palettes
that again I thought it was gonna be
very very smooth and creamy and these
weren't going to crease on the eyelid
they weren't gonna be too chunky but I
feel like color pop does need to work on
their shimmer as well as their glitter
pressed shadows I think that their mats
are really really fantastic very easy to
blend very very good pigmentation but
these are insanely hard to work with and
also I don't know if you guys can see
here but I do have a little bit like oil
pan seepage going on here and the
formula actually reminds me a lot of the
Anasazi of Beverly Hills Nicole Guerrero
glow kit but those are much more
pigmented and you'll wear them on the
skin you don't wear them on the eyes I
feel like if I were to use the Nicole
Guerrero glow kit on my eyes I also
would have the same issue so what ton of
fall out really really chunky just not
the greatest palette I had very very
high hopes but I did not end up liking
it next up we actually have a 9 p.m.
here from two-face I tried to get this
to work for many many years and before
you go and write of course you hate
something from two-face you guys if I
really really really hated two-face I
promise you I would boycott them it used
to be one of my favourite brands and I
have to say normally the nine pen
palettes from two-face are some of my
favorites the old-school nine pan
palettes had a really really phenomenal
formula right now we're two-faced is I
feel like a lot of they're 9 pan
palettes are either a hit or a shit sort
of deal so this was one of those
palettes that came out I believe about
two years ago and I did enjoy the color
selection and I do still enjoy the color
selection in here blue raspberry as well
as bubblegum and this guy right here
called sugar plum or strawberry is that
lavender shade is so spectacular and
beautiful but there is something about
this formula where I just feel like they
fade throughout the day no matter what I
do I could use a glitter glue which
technically you don't even need to use
with a palette like this because it is
just shimmers there's not really a ton
of pretty litter sheets in here I mean
there's always one in a two face palette
and I guess it is the shade bubblegum
but you shouldn't have to use a glitter
glue with these any kind of primer I use
whether it be drugstore or high and just
did not work with these so I don't like
shadows that are gonna fade on my eyes
after three to four hours I think that
is extremely shitty especially
considering this was a $34 palette that
should not be happening that should not
be happening with the $20 palette it
just shouldn't in my opinion especially
when you're using such a nice eye primer
so I am gonna go ahead and let this go
one of my friends wants to try it out so
we're gonna send it her way very cute
packaging very very nice setup and if
this was the typical kind of 9 pan
palette formula that I'm used to when it
comes to Too Faced I think it would be
spectacular really really cool color
selection but unfortunately it just
didn't work for me moving on to the
lorac unzipped gold palette the sister
palette is amazing the original unzipped
is so good I actually purchased these at
the same time during the Ulta 21 days of
beauty event probably like a year and a
half ago tried the original unzip first
and then I went into this with very very
high expectations I am NOT a fan of
brands bringing out a second or sister
palette edition and then having a
completely different formula and that is
exactly what is going on with this
palette right here the shimmers and the
colors in here are beautiful
unpredictable as well as Unleashed are
gorgeous that they are incredibly
incredibly chunky you get a lot of
fallout I almost get color pop golden
state of mind vibes with
shimmers in here and they are so
incredibly crumbly and you know it's
just very unusual to see because you see
lorac having some really really
fantastic formulas like the fucking pro
fabula is amazing
the shimmers and the max in there are
equally as good they perform equally as
well they're soft they're smooth they're
buttery they do have quite a bit of kick
up but it's just different with these I
feel like they're crumbly and the mattes
in here just kind of fade away you blend
you blend you blend and then suddenly
you know you have this dark chocolate
brown color here and then it's like this
actually kind of gray color it's just
not for me I think that's somebody who
wants to have a little more time in
patience could definitely work with
something like this but for me when I'm
using a lot of big fluffy brushes and I
want to get an eye look done very
quickly I don't want to have to deal
with this crumbly formula next I have a
butter a London palette here that one of
my friends actually sent to me this is
the butter LONDON
Pantone color of the Year eyeshadow
palette it's a greenery color of the
year so this was from a couple years ago
and I really really was excited to try
this out I looked at the color selection
and I thought immediately I dig that I'm
into it I love cool tone eyeshadows you
guys I actually do naturally pull a very
very cool tone in my skin so when I look
at this and I see those topes and I see
these darker greens over here and then
that pop of green it just looked really
really cool and simple and neutral but
great for work especially if you're a
teacher like me great for everyday sort
of occasions so I really started to use
this and I notice you know what this is
doing exactly what this palette right
here does and this is the lorac a nude
necessities palette I actually reviewed
this probably about two years ago I
loved it when I first saw at you guys
but then I realized you're only gonna
get one sort of I look with this palette
what happens is all these colors are
just way too similar to one another and
that is one of the reasons why I also
didn't pick up new color pop fame
palette I feel like when you have so
many tones that are so similar to one
another you're only gonna get one kind
of Iloka you are only gonna get one sort
own on your eye unless you are
incredibly talented and able to work
other things in which I'm not I want to
be able to get a lot of different uses
out of my palettes and recently I have
noticed that I've been in love with like
my violet vos ride-or-die palette where
you know you have all these different
finishes you have all these different
colors you have some really cool tones
really warm tones you have smoky tones I
started to notice I'm really into a
palette that kind of offers everything
so while I did enjoy this palette for a
small amount of time it wasn't something
that really really ended up being
amazing for me and same goes for the
lorac nude necessities palette I liked
it at a point in time and I thought hey
this is exactly what I'm looking for I
like neutral eyeshadow but you know my
eyeshadow preferences have changed and
now I'm looking for palettes that kind
of offer a little more than this and
then the last eyeshadow palette we have
here I've been trying to work with
recently this was something that I
immediately put into one of my eyeshadow
palettes II clutters and then I kind of
pulled it out tried it again and then it
went back into the declutter pile this
is from a crown of beauty and this is
their eyeshadow palette it's called the
glam metals eyeshadow palette a cool
color selection as you guys can see I
feel like these kind of neutral muddy
green colors are very in right now
however these crease like a mofo on me
and it's not even like they have this
really really thick foil texture to them
I don't feel humectant when I dip my
finger in there yet I just get this huge
amount of creasing and I mean it will
look like I have three different eyelids
and you know what it just kind of ages
my eyes I'm gonna be 26 in about a month
year but like I looked a lot older when
I was wearing it even when I would smoke
it out on my lower lashline it was
really emphasizing fine lines and
texture which is fucking weird because
normally an eyeshadow palette doesn't do
that shit okay that's usually your
concealer and you know your foundation
but this was definitely something that
just kind of emphasized all the things
that I didn't want emphasized maybe a
little bit of a petty reason to get rid
of a palette like this but I normally
can deal with creasing but this was just
too much there's something about this
formula that was way overboard so then
those are the five different eyeshadow
palettes that I wanted to love but
unfortunately didn't let's go ahead and
move on to the face palette number one
the Wet n Wild mega Glo highlighting
palette I like this I actually did enjoy
this when I first got it I did a review
on it I said hella yeah pick it up and
now I am eating my words and saying
don't pick it up even if it's still
available
you know the packaging of this could
have been so what much better and even
if they just charge two dollars more it
just could have been so much more in my
opinion
basically this was a $15 pallet if you
do get the full size of the wet wild
highlighters they are $4.99 apiece so if
this is about right as far as price is
concerned but this is just not the
original formula the only two shades in
here that do you feel like the original
formula that you can get in the full
sizes which I have a ton of are probably
in the grain as well as the blue in here
and those are definitely not as wearable
as the other two shades so you have this
beautiful green and this beautiful blue
and you guys will see when I swatch them
they go on really really nicely they
have a nice high shine impact and I am a
huge into colorful highlighters but I
just feel like when I have a palette and
I only really enjoy two of the formulas
or two of the colors what's the point in
having it especially when I do have full
sizes of these highlighters that I
really enjoy and this one right here
just ended up being a little chunky it
is one of the pink colors and you guys
can probably see just like that it
definitely does have a little more
texture to it and then they went ahead
and glitter infuse the peach color down
here and it's just not worth it I am
starting to look at my collection King
like fuck you know if I have a
highlighting palette and it has two
different shades that I like and two
that I don't like
I can't swap them out like the anasazi
of Beverly Hills glow kit you know is it
worth it to have in my collection and
for me the answer is no all right color
pop I like your face palette I wanted to
love this my friend sent this to me and
I actually think that the color
selection in here is fuckin poppin I
really really enjoy this peachy golden
shade as well as this kind of rose gold
and this shade right here a lot of
people were comparing this to the
Anasazi of Beverly Hills on a coal
guerreiro glow kit but they definitely
just aren't similar when it comes to the
formula a lot of people did not like the
nicole guerrero glow kit but I
definitely can make that one work on my
cheeks versus this one I would say
within two weeks of using this I was
hitting hard pan on practically every
single shade in here and definitely this
guy this guy and this guy is cause this
guy right here you just see this filmy
layer over it and I tried so many
different brushes and it is such a pain
in the ass when you get hard pan so this
is just not fucking worth it you can go
in you can take that shit and you can
try and get off that layer of hard pan
but when you have to do that over and
over and over again no matter what brush
you're using technique you're using it
is a pain in the ass and it is just not
worth it for me so now that is why I am
letting go of this palette again some
people might think that's a petty reason
but you know what fuck it I have baked
jala formulas in my collection that
don't even get as much hard pan as this
and I shouldn't have to go in with all
sorts of different brushes trying to
make sure I'm not gonna get hard pan and
then have to duct tape the goddamn pans
after so thank you so much for my friend
Brittany who sent this to me it did not
work out for me I am going to be going
ahead and a donating this and hopefully
whoever gets it will enjoy it alright
here we have the Urban Decay afterglow
ons one-night-stand palette let's be
honest I liked this when I first got it
I actually did a whole entire video
talking about this palette and I think
what really got me excited was the fact
that it was on sale girl it was like
twenty dollars on sale I think I
recently saw Samantha do a video as well
where she mentioned this palette notice
that I was getting a lot more texture
that I initially had gotten and it's
funny because you can kind of see like
this shade right here which is called
click it looks a little more smoother
and then say wicked or even no angel I
feel like the more I worked into these
pans the thicker and stickier they got
now I did end up going ahead and
actually decluttering my full-size eight
hour powder highlighters from Urban
Decay I just feel like they are a sticky
and thick foiled texture that doesn't
look pretty on my skin and funny you
know sometimes you need to do follow-up
reviews sometimes you need to really be
careful and make sure that you're
reviewing a product for a more than a
week or two weeks before you even jump
in and give your thoughts because this
was something that initially I really
liked and then I started to get more
into the product and I was like what the
fuck is this so decluttering that for
sure so I know recently a lot of people
have been getting PR from Coastal Scents
I did get some PR from them like their
hot pots as well as some of their little
are these hot pots I don't know how
that's as far as a blusher bronzer and
highlight is concerned but I really
don't like these and I'm not a huge fan
of the hot puffs either I don't know
what it is so like I said these were
sent to me for PR I am just not a fan of
the wear time on these products they are
smooth they are creamy they have pretty
color selections bitch okay this blush
right here
reminds me of like tarts exposed again
good pigmentation very very pretty
almost satiny color going on here but
they just fade so unevenly throughout
the day and it really really pisses me
off I am just not the kind of girl that
can deal with that you guys I really
really need something especially when it
comes to blush and highlight that is
going to hang on my face all day long
because there is nothing I hate more
than coming home from a long day at work
and seen that it just looks like I'm
wearing foundation all over my face
there's no bronzer there's no contour
there's no blush especially when you are
as pale as me you heavenly rely on
having that blush stick on your skin all
day long so beautiful color selection
beautiful pigmentation maybe this will
be a good option for those of you who
just want to wear something for 3 to 4
hours but when I'm looking at a long ass
10 plus hour workday and this is not
going to last for me so I'm going to go
ahead and let that go and finally we
have one of the most deceiving palettes
in my collection well no this has been
sitting my declutter pile for probably
like a year and a half now
I actually sent it to one friend and she
sent it back to me
that's how shit these blushes are this
is from Tarte cosmetics guys if this is
a big a blush book - I had such high
hopes for this this was obviously before
I boycotted Tarte I think they're on
volume 4 or 5 now of the big blush book
but make sure you go ahead and you look
at the ingredients list when it comes to
their full-size i'm 14 hour 18 hour
blushes and then look at what you're
getting in here because this was cheaply
made in china nothing like the original
blush formula i can tell you that right
off the bat one of the reasons why i was
so excited for it was because i was like
hell yeah look at that color selection
you have a beautiful mob some deeper
color similar to expose you also have a
highlight in the middle here as well as
some really really pretty blush colors
it's all some really really pretty blush
colors are these anything spectacular
for tarte cosmetics absolutely not
you're always going to get the same sort
of washed colors over and over again but
it did have a hot coral as well as a
light pink down here and i just had
really high hopes that this was going to
be a huge bang for your buck because
this was $60 for all of these blushes in
here and they do pop out pretty easily
so you could go ahead and put them in
your own palette if you wanted to but
unfortunately these are so dusty they
are so incredibly chunky on the cheeks
and the wear time is not
if you have ever gone into a tarte blush
okay and their original formula is
fucking bad-ass I'm going to give that
to them I'm not gonna sit here and shit
on them for that because it is a
fantastic formula if you are getting the
original formula and you go in there
with a brush you know that none of these
kick up a lot of powder they are
actually very very firmly pressed which
makes them incredibly long wearing on
the cheeks these guys right here are a
hot powdery math you get them on and
it's just like bull fucking dust okay so
this was definitely one of those
palettes I was so excited to get and so
disappointed when I actually got it I
did a full review on this like I said it
was a while back I ended up sending it
to a friend she sent it back to me now
I'm reading cluttering it so anyway guys
those are 10 different palettes that I
wanted to love that unfortunately I did
not I do hope you enjoyed this video
thanks so much for joining me and I'll
see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
