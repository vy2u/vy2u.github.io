my channel I hope you enjoy that
thumbnail be looking incredibly
constipated today I wanted to walk you
guys through the ten shittiest a makeup
releases of 2017 I did a video like this
alas tear and actually on Monday of this
week I did a video talking all about my
favorite beauty products of 2017
originally I wanted this one to be all
beauty products but they really haven't
been any like skincare or like body care
products that piss me off the amount
that these makeup products have no
obviously you guys this is just my list
these are my ten shittiest makeup
products of the year if you have a list
that you would like to leave down below
please go ahead and do so but obviously
these are just my feelings okay
my conspiracy allegedly allegedly okay
that's enough of that I'm not a damn
drama channel let me just jump right
into it number one guys to face peanut
butter and honey I use shadow ballad if
you saw my first impressions on this I
really tried okay I really
really tried I kind of bit my tongue a
little bit I didn't really want to say
what I was thinking but yeah it's a
piece of okay this was not it go-to
palette it released in I believe
February remember was like late March or
early March and you know the thing about
this one was that I liked the concept
and I liked that it went ahead like kind
of combined together with a peanut
butter and jelly palette the peanut
butter and jelly palette that 9 pan of
formula right there is
incredible
sometimes Too Faced brings out really
great eyeshadow palettes really great 9
pen pals and then sometimes it's just so
utterly disappointing okay it's so
utterly disappointing and this happened
to be one of those eyeshadow palettes
this year that was very disappointed I
feel like I really have to build the
color up on my eyes I will go ahead and
insert a photo from my first impressions
video and I'll also throw it up in the
cards if you want to check it out but
you could see that it still looks so
mundane at the end and I was building
color after color after color so yeah I
have to say the first product that was
super super shitty this year as far as
makeup is concerned will see Too Faced
peanut butter and honey palette after
releasing after you know the peanut
butter and jelly palette I was expecting
a lot and that's the thing about Too
Faced you start to build these
expectations and then it comes crashing
down sometimes there's really good
products and sometimes they're not so
that was definitely the first product I
want to talk about up next week the
Urban Decay Naked skin highlighting
fluids now the shades I purchased were
aura and luminous I don't understand
these I don't understand these
you're so weird they kind of
came in the same sort of bottle as the
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer as well
as the Urban Decay color correcting
fluids and the thought concept was that
he was a very natural barely they're
kind of high late but the she's luminous
had like these big chunks of gold
glitter in it and then aura was like
barely visible on the skin I understand
the naked skin trend I get what they're
going for but these were so stupid they
were like $32 for this tiny amount of
product you could barely see it on your
skin I did end up decluttering both of
mine too my friend she does like them
but that's because she doesn't wear any
makeup or she'll doesn't wear any face
makeup so she was like oh yeah they look
great on me I couldn't see okay I
would put this stuff on and you couldn't
see anything okay you just really
couldn't see anything and because they
were a cream you have to put it on first
and then powder your face while I powder
my face a lot okay and I would just end
up covering everything up so those were
really really useless in my opinion and
not a lot of people enjoy those and I'm
sure it's not one of them okay moving on
to the color pop Golden State of Mind
palette I feel like a lot of people
would swap this one out and say no the
anasazi of Beverly Hills subculture
palette was way worse than that one but
in my opinion I do not like this I like
a lot of the press shadows and love the
press shadow formula in general from
colour-pop but I have to say these were
just not what I was expecting and I was
 worried that this would happen
okay I knew the second that Sephora
picked up color pop I had to be cautious
of some of their releases I feel like
right now color crop is going away too
much of a wait wait they're releasing
way too many products and I can't keep
up I'm starting to get bored with the
brand which is a shame because these
eyeshadow palettes that they come out
with are really really good so for me
I'm sitting over here and I'm trying to
get these shimmer shades to work for me
and they're just not I love my Urban
Decay heavy metals palette I love my new
Too Faced palette which yes see I've
told you to faith does sometimes but
really good products
I love the new Too Faced chocolate gold
palette but I just can't get these color
pop shadows to work for me they're
incredibly chunky incredibly glittery
and like I said I feel like a lot of
people would probably say the subculture
is a lot worse than the color pop golden
state of my palette but this is my
 list and you know what the color
pop golden state of my palette is on it
next up guys we have
to face palette I know it's very sad but
this is the Too Faced natural love
palette yet again another palette that
just was not good quality now it was
kind of funny because originally when I
did my review on this I talked about how
god these are really they swatch
horribly they go on to the eyes horribly
especially the darker shades some of the
nice kind of lighter shades than
mid-tone shades we're beautiful on the
eyes but again when you look at that
palette and you see the color layout
that they actually have there you don't
really realize in your head at the
moment okay all of these are kind of
going to blend together but honestly
they all kind of blend together
and they have a very similar sort of
color scheme going on you have a lot of
neutral shades and then some darker
shades but like I said the darker shades
just don't look good I'm gonna insert a
photo here of some swatches so you guys
can see they are they just swatch
incredibly poorly and this it was a
palette that a lot of people were
telling me live this is not right my
palette is great I'm having a great time
with my palette so I actually went ahead
and purchased two more because I wanted
to see if it was a batch issue and you
know what that all three of them
sucked they were all horrible they all
have the same issue so I'm really happy
if you've got a good one but you know
what the Too Faced natural love palette
is not worth it in my opinion as a color
scheme is something that you can find
him practically any other neutral
eyeshadow palette on the market and like
I said the quality just wasn't there for
me
and I don't know I mean I would love to
say it's a batch issue because I know
some of you love your palette but all
three of mine suck so it's got to be a
list it's got to be on the list alright
guys let's talk about the Tarte
rainforest of the sea volume 3 eyeshadow
palette so this was one of those kind of
funny situations again kind of tart and
two-faced you know how they are they
 start something and then they
don't they don't they don't continue
with it so they'll have a great formula
right and then they decide they're gonna
change it up so if you have something
from the rainforest of the sea
collection okay like these eyeshadow
palettes you a Volume one which was good
a volume 2 which was excellent it's like
okay they stepped up their game now stop
just stop but then they go back
and they make volume three and it's a
piece of this was infused with
glitter and in my opinion some of these
eyeshadows are just not I saved they
were so chunky I got so much fall I was
like a little mud pile
underneath my cheek bugs you know I'm
saying looked like I was wearing bronzer
on my cheekbones but also I just felt
like a lot of these stung my eyes I
couldn't get any of them to work maybe
it's just cuz I suck at
eyeshadow and I'm putting my eyeshadow
on poking myself in the eye but I really
felt like a lot of these just weren't
good for the eyes you had to foil them
you had to use like a glitter glue and
that was not what the second volume was
like I hate when tart and two-faced do
this I hate when any brand does this if
you have a good a formulation please
don't try and fix it it's good
leave it leave it the way it is so yeah
that was definitely one of those
palettes that was a letdown because I
thought oh my god it's like it gets
gonna be like volume too you know they
couldn't step it up any further than
volume 2 like keep it where it's at and
it was completely disappointing now it
is also a theis and eye palette so you
can't use it on your cheekbones I was
using it as a highlighter for a while
but I can't do that anymore I just looks
horrible on my dry skin I actually have
another eyeshadow palette declutter
video that I pre film for you guys that
will be going up on Monday and you will
see that palette going bye-bye so anyway
I wanted to include the chart rate
versus the see of volume 3 eyeshadow
palette in this video up next let's talk
about the worst foundation that I tried
out this year it was for sure the
Neutrogena hydraboost hydrating tint I
feel like when I put this on my skin you
know you would think like it has
hyaluronic acid it's gonna be nice and
make your skin look super buoyant and
very not buoyant but you don't mean like
clumped up exact opposite I honestly
look like I'm 84 years old when I wear
this foundation I'm not even kidding I
wanted to a video for you guys talking
about products that age me you know cuz
sometimes you put on concealers or
foundations I've been wearing a
foundation this week that really has not
been sitting nicely under the eyes you
know sometimes you just put makeup on
and it makes you look older okay
it makes you look older and this was
absolutely one of those foundations it's
so strange because it kind of was like a
skin tint it did have a little bit of a
thicker formula but I mean it this has
to be the worst round you should I try
it out this year and it just really
didn't go well with my skin even down
here in the death or even up in
Milwaukee when I had more combo oily
this looks like on me so I had to
include the Neutrogena hydro boost
hydrating tent up next we have the Too
Faced Lovelight prismatic highlighters I
know I know another product I'm too big
but I got to do it I still do have one
of them and I believe I'm going to
declutter it because I really don't
reach for it but and you know the thing
about these were that I think a lot of
people thought okay there's a big Shola
sort of formula they're gonna be
blinding they're called love light
laterz they have blinded by the light
and then the other shade that they were
talking about was I can't even remember
but you know they had all these
different shades and it just kind of
made you think that these were going to
be those sort of highlight that you see
from outer space they were maybe like
the pigmentation level reminds me of
like the Urban Decay Naked skin
hydrating fluids to be completely honest
you know you need the right brush to
pick them up with because they are a big
Chalet sort of formula but I have a ton
of highlighters they're a facial and I
could not get these to work also the
lightest shade had a tiny bit of glitter
in it which I'm not a fan of either so I
did want to include them on the list
they weren't horrible horrible but they
were pretty bad okay yeah
they're pretty shitty they're pretty
shaky all right guys let's move on to
the pier Cosmetics no filter blurring
photography primer by far the worst
primer I tried this year and this was
the strangest thing I kind of had like
that NARS is all but troughs thing going
on so you had like a fluid a white base
and you have like this little dropper
bottle by the way and it used to open up
all the time at the top or the dropper
wasn't leaked all over my makeup
but it was basically this white color
with a strong golden ship to it now when
you put it into your hand you can't see
that there's a golden ship so I would
like rub it around my face and it
honestly looks like the Tin Man
but like gold like you know like it was
so incredibly shiny and I didn't do
anything for me honestly him that did
not prolong the wear of my foundation it
did not make my pores look smaller it
did not hydrate my skin it was by far
the worst primer I tried out this year
and that was sent to me from pure and I
know that that I'm not on their pure
lives anymore but you know what peer
that was visage it your blurring
photography primer kind of sucks okay
are you guys up next we do have a
holiday release I felt like I had to at
least include one I think the worst
holiday release that came out this year
was by far from Tarte and it is the
goddess glow highlighter this was such a
disappointing product it is from the
rainforest of the sea collection which
normally the rainforest of the sea
collection doesn't disappoint me too
much it disappoints me when they start
to reformulate some of the stuff when
they do volume one two and three you
know and I'm saying but it doesn't
really bother me as a whole I feel like
the rainforest of the sea collection is
pretty damn good but this was they got a
slow high later it feels like sandpaper
it goes onto the skin like sandpaper you
literally can see every single pore
every fine line every wrinkle oh yeah
and there's glitter all up in there so
hope that was
disappointment I felt like I should at
least include a one product from holiday
2017 probably one of the worst
highlighters I tried out definitely
worse than the Lovelight prismatic
highlighters from Too Faced but I still
don't like those so I wanted to include
them as well and finally guys the worst
product um as far as powder is concerned
this year that I tried out I usually
like powders I like powders a lot okay
it's very hard for me not to love a
powder or at least like it but I have to
say the becca soft light blurring powder
in the shade pink haze is truly just
like a powdered pepto-bismol all
up in your face if you have a deeper
skin complexion or skin tone I feel like
it wouldn't look nice on you maybe a
percent underneath the eyes but it feels
very soft to the touch almost like a
silica powder but it sure as hell
doesn't go on like a silica powder I
can't use it as a blush I can't use it
as a blush topper I can't use it as a
setting powder and I sure as hell can I
use it underneath my eyes it is so
incredibly cool tone and pink and you
know for the price it's just really not
worth it that one was also sent to me
for PR but you know what it's got to be
the worst powder of the year so anyway
guys those are my ten shittiest makeup
products of the year I know there's a
lot of storage in here but I've been
excited for this video I like talking
about products that I don't enjoy
because I really do truly feel like it
helps you guys out even if it didn't
help you out I hope you enjoyed the
video please let me know down below what
your 5 to 10 shittiest products of the
year are and I guess I will see you
tomorrow and I have a foundation Friday
video going off I have not done any
first impressions on a foundation in a
while so I will see you guys then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
