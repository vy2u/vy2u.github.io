long-awaited video well not really I
posted last week that I was having a
giveaway for reaching a thousand seven
user subscribers on youtube I think it's
awesome I'm so happy I'm a little over
like 1200 now which is even more cool I
just want to say right away thank you so
much to everybody that wrote live loves
give away its below because I was
looking at that stuff like and I noticed
people kept like retyping yet and then I
was typing on my phone and like you know
it was weird I promise next time i will
have like a better phrase or something
because autocorrect was like in and out
that's not real like that's not name
that's not whatever and so you know next
time like i said this was my first
giveaway so bear with me um but anyway
also I want to say I'm sorry if I did
not make it clear every single giveaway
that I'm going to have international
absolutely I'm not just going to be
doing you know the US or things like
that I do not mind paying to ship to you
guys internationally I know a lot of
people were asking questions below and
another thing i want to say is that um I
didn't realize how many people were
going to enter and a lot of people wrote
like a really sweet little message with
you know live loves giveaways and I
started answering like a few of them and
like thumbs up like the comment and then
I realized there were so many like there
was like four hundred I couldn't get to
all of them so I just want to say if you
did leave a sweet comment thank you so
much and the reason I want to also say
that is because the winner actually left
me a very very sweet comment and I hope
this isn't controversial I just want to
say right away this was like a raffle I
you know did it with the computer things
like that I had no say in this I really
wanted to make it fair to New subbies to
old subbies and it just so happened and
I kind of love it because she has been
with me since the beginning um it just
so happened that the person who won is
somebody who literally has been with me
for a very long time since I probably
had like I don't even know I think she
left a comment it said like four or five
subscribers um so I just want to put
that out there because i think i did
respond to her comment I don't want you
guys to think that you know I was um you
know just picking her because she leaves
nice comments he biked all like really
sweet messages i wish i could give
everything to you guys I love sharing
and I want you guys to know that I plan
on doing this until every single
thousand subscribers and tell 5,000 and
then from there maybe every 2,000 I love
sharing with you guys products that I
enjoy and um it's just you know it's one
of those things and I just I like to
share so I'm going to try and every
single give away like I said I always
international I will leave that in the
down bar next time I know people were
asking it and get back to a few of you
yes I'll bees international I do not
mind shipping to you guys um but I do
want to say I'm going to try and use
products that like I really like and I
think you guys would like which is why
one of them was the make up for ever a
professional Paris artist shadows number
one this is the neutral one they also
have a number 2 i've reviewed both the
second one has like pink and green and
stuff and like i said i didn't know who
was going to win the giveaway I don't
know if they're gonna like that you know
things like that so I thought neutral
was best and then I'm breaking my trend
here and I actually picked a contour
palette um that I have not tried and the
reason i wanted to do just one person
instead of to a lot of people were
asking like why don't you just give this
away then this way they have to go
together okay girl has to contour her
face or guy whoever and then you have to
have a nice eyeshadow palette like you
know so um maybe when you know like
2,000 subbies maybe I'll do like two
people things like that it all depends
um you know I guess it really just
depends on what i'm going to be giving
away if it happens to be drug store
stuff and i'll probably do quite a few
of you because that tends to be cheaper
but these products together we're around
like ninety dollars and i totally don't
mind because I think you guys are going
to love them and I think the person who
lon is going to love them and I just
want to say I originally was going to do
the cocoa contour kit which is one of my
favorites from Too Faced however I was
looking at it and I was
wow I'm so in love with this but why and
it's because the contouring shades are
very very light and I'm like Casper I'm
very very pale um and they just blend
well for me and things like that and I
went on the support website and I
thought you know what this Kat Von D
shade + light which I have not tried I
don't even know what it looks like out
of the box they're not going to be
opening any of these i'm just going to
ship them directly to the winner um but
it shows that they have like lighter
shades and really really deep ones
because like i said i didn't know um the
ethnicity of the person is going to win
so I just always want to make sure that
when I'm doing giveaways I'm doing it um
you know it has to include something
that everybody can use so anyway without
further ado um I want to announce the
winner and I'm going to read her comment
and the winner is Claudia Heller and she
has actually been with me for a very
long time on my channel like I said I
hope you guys don't think oh you know
she chose her because she you know has
been there forever no it's not like that
I literally it was literally a raffle
okay it literally was like anybody could
have won I have no say in it so um it
was computer basically you know if
you're not ok with that then you know go
blame the computer not me I didn't pick
um but claudia has been with me ah here
i think she said yeah ok so i'm gonna
read her comment so you guys can
understand she says live love giveaways
and then she said wow I can't believe
how fast your channel is growing over
8,000 subs I still remember when we were
just three or four subscribers Congrats
so i have to admit i would have loved if
it go on you know if this had gone to a
new subscriber but it is very sweet that
my first giveaway ended up going to a
subscriber that has been there from the
beginning and um i think it's just
really really sweet like i said i'm not
biased at all I didn't have any say in
the matter however I wouldn't have cared
if you just subscribe to me just to do
the giveaway I would have still give it
to you if it was my choice you know I
want to give it all to you guys but
basically um Claudia is so sweet she
leads a lot of
really great um like precise comments
and she always says something sweet and
she's just you know she always tells me
you know you make me want to buy this
product like good because it's great so
um anyway that is the winner I'm going
to spell her name just in case I mean
I'm sure she knows what i mean but you
know what i mean so it's claudia heller
