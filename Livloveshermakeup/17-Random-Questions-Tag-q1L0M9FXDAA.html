to be more of a get to know me start a
video I think it's fun to throw one of
these in every once in a while to see
you guys can get to know me a little
better and i found a tag video or and
also just like questions on google that
i thought would be fun to do so this is
the 17 random questions tag so just
random questions and hopefully you guys
will learn some more about me so let's
just get started and the first question
is how did you get your youtube username
so um my youtube username live loves her
makeup I really just got because my name
is Olivia and I thought you know i typed
in Olivia loves makeup and they were
like sorry that's already taken so like
every version of like Olivia and makeup
or something already taken so I thought
of live because a lot of people call me
live um and yeah a lot of my friends
call me that and family and things like
that so I just thought live loves her
makeup was a good one so yeah um number
two is if you could change your name to
anything what would it be and why I'm
pretty sure they mean my actual name not
my youtube name because you can actually
change those um I would change my name
to press FN e and I know that that
sounds really weird but when I was in
like fourth or fifth grade I played
Persephone who is like queen of the
underworld in Greek mythology um I
played her in a play and I always that
name just like struck like me like I'm
just in love with that name Persephone
I'm not quite sure why I know it's very
odd and different but I just think it's
such a beautiful name so that would be
the reason and why is just because it
resonates with me number three if you
could go back in time and give yourself
self advice what would it be and why I
would tell myself to stop wearing so
much self tanner on my body when I was
younger I bought a lot of like self
tanner as you guys can tell I don't
anymore I'm okay with being fail now but
when I was younger I definitely
definitely wanted to be tan so I would
slap on like literally so much self
tanner and I looked orange and people at
school would be like you look orange
like Oompa Loompa over there but I
didn't care I thought I look tan and
cool and um I look back now and see that
I definitely should not have done that
so I would tell myself stop crying so
much
afgan er um number four how old were you
when you first learned to blow a bubble
gum bubble probably very young because I
am quite good at blowing at bubbles so
i'm gonna say maybe like seven or eight
um number five what do you what did you
want to be when you were little um I
wanted to be a veterinarian and that is
still something that I think about to
this day that I would have loved to be
obviously I'm a musician I ended up
being a musician but I've always loved
animals and that was just something that
like I definitely wanted to be when I
was younger and I still sometimes
daydream about it so definitely a
veterinarian um number six of what do
you order at starbucks any time I go to
starbucks i usually order one of two
things the first thing being a pumpkin
spice latte if it is that time of year
and they are out the second thing is
definitely actually I would say this one
is the 1i order the most so it's a iced
passion sweetened tea and it's like that
pink passion iced tea it's so good I
love it and that is what i order the
most often pumpkin spice coming in a
close second all right um what's the
hardest you've ever laughed like when
was the hard as I relax probably with
i'm going to say like a childhood friend
probably my friend anna growing up we
used to take reporter lessons together
music classes together and i would just
look at her and burst into laughter I
could not the sheet to this day is the
person I have laughed so much before
that I start crying um I don't know what
it is just looking at her we have that
you know you always have that one friend
where you can just look at them and you
can't help and start laughing it was her
and we would just look at each other and
start laughing and we'd start with
making noises through our instruments by
hacks between it was very very we'd give
them a lot of trouble but it would
definitely be my childhood friend Anna
um number eight if you could play any
musical instrument which would it be and
why well I already play a lot of
instruments I play flipped baroque flute
recorders I play alto flute and also
piccolo I am a musician I'm so that's
why but there is one instrument that I
wanted to play it my whole entire life
and that is harp I just I don't know I
feel like I you know associate myself
with being a harpist like at heart um
and I went to conservatory and I have
had friends who play harp and things
like that and I think it's just such a
beautiful instrument i love the way it
sounds and that is the one I've always
wanted to play of course when I was
younger I played violin and my mom
always I would ask her can i play harp
and she said I'm not moving that thing
around for you because you actually have
to like wheel the harp around and
they're huge you know they're like
taller than you so that is why she
wouldn't let me but I really really
wanted to play hard when I you know with
younger and still to this day if I could
play any instrument it would be hard um
number 9 what's your favorite thing to
do when you're upset my favorite thing
to do when I'm upset is be alone I know
that sounds really weird but i will tell
like my boyfriend if we are arguing or
if something has happened and i'm just
upset i asked him to just leave me alone
I just need a lot of space when I'm
upset I'm one of those people that just
needs to like self um like put myself
back together if that makes sense it
doesn't work for me to go to other
people and trying like feed off their
energy and make myself feel better I
really have to do it myself um so it's
like an internal battle basically
between me myself and I but that is
definitely what I do when I'm upset also
I like to just turn on you know some
netflix or hulu watch some you know
stupid show like I mean I'm not to save
as a stupid show I love south park but
you know something like that where it's
not going to make you to like make you
feel too much if anything it will make
you laugh that's definitely um probably
what I do I like to be alone and watch a
funny show so yeah um number 10 what's
your favorite movie oh goodness um I
would say the first one that comes to
mind is life of pi I felt that was an
amazing movie I love the message I loved
everything about it the special effects
everything so yeah I'm gonna go with
life of pi or I know I'm a big
one life is beautiful is also a
wonderful movie and one of my favorites
um
let's see here what's one food you
cannot live without um the first thing
that pops into my head is McDonald I
love we thought but that is not a food
that is like a store brand um so I'm
gonna go with cheese you guys I love
cheese and it's so upsetting because
like there's a part of me that um kind
of wants to be vegan again I was vegan
when I was younger I was actually raised
vegan and like vegetarian all that stuff
um however if there's just like a part
of me that kind of wishes I could go
vegan again if that makes sense so I
would definitely say cheese but it would
be very hard to give up because I just
love like brie cheddar anything with
like some crackers I love it so
definitely cheese um do do number 12
what's your favorite dessert my favorite
dessert it's a hard one I really like
all sweet so I'm not going to say it's
like chocolate or something like that
because I actually don't love chocolate
i really like it but I don't love it um
maybe I'm not quite sure you guys
honestly um i just kind of want to go
with ice cream because I could eat ice
cream all day every day or like sorbet
or something like that um yeah so I'm
gonna call the ice cream ice cream with
my favorite dessert let's see here
number 13 favorite pizza topping I like
mushrooms and onions on my pizza number
14 would you rather have the super power
to read minds or the super power to be
invisible definitely the super power to
be invisible there are times where I
don't want anybody looking at me I don't
want to be noticed I don't want anything
and I think that I have like a very easy
I'm not like wearing makeup and all this
kind of stuff I feel like sometimes i
get negative attention or just attention
i don't want just because i have a very
bright personality that didn't sound
super cocky i don't mean it like that at
all i just mean um I'm it's hard for me
to go um like I know I don't want to say
unnoticed cuz I them so bad it sounds
like so bad but I just um I sometimes
just draw in like negative attention and
things like that I don't
I don't really know why and even if I'm
not wearing makeup even if I look like a
hot mess um I don't know you know I get
a lot of people that approached me for
money a lot of people who like you know
just weird stuff like that and there's
times where I just I get embarrassed
pretty easily sometimes so there's times
where I just wish like I was invisible
so definitely invisible rather than
reading minds because if I were reading
minds that would probably make me upset
because you could probably see how much
people are judging you um number 15 what
did you do for your last birthday my
last birthday of my boyfriend came to
visit me and we were in Manhattan and we
just hung out and we work together and
we just had a great time so i just spent
on my birthday with my boyfriend and
number 16 if you had one personal
selfish wish what would it be and why um
like I said it would probably be like
the ability to be like oh you know like
invisible almost um I know that's kind
of selfish because like it doesn't work
it will never happen but um you know I
just get I sometimes get uncomfortable I
don't know what it is um maybe living in
Manhattan for a while got me like a
little bit uncomfortable but just like
walking on the streets and things like
that I get uncomfortable when like
strangers and things like that like
approached me or something I just get
like I don't get scared I just get
uncomfortable and it's weird because
like um when it comes to like being on
camera and also when it comes to being
on stage and I'm a musician and things
like that I'm so out there and I don't
get embarrassed about anything however
in real life you know I sometimes just
get very self-conscious about how I look
or how I feel and I really try and work
hard on that but i think my one selfish
wish would be to sometimes just be able
to be like invisible um just you know
just for my own benefit and number 17
the last question is if you were a
pokemon of what would you be called what
would you look like can I pick one
that's already out there because I feel
like I would be Jigglypuff I love
Jigglypuff she's so cute she's got the
little girl thing going on she pink
she's got big blue eyes she's like
totally up my alley so yes I'm gonna go
with Jigglypuff and what
I look like I would look exactly like
Jigglypuff because she is perfect and
adorable so anyway that was the 17
random questions tag I hope you guys
