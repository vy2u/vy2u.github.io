happy thanksgiving um of course that's
only for those of you in the US who
actually celebrate thanksgiving i hope
you're having a fantastic day whether or
not you are celebrating or you are it
but anyway today i'm sharing with you
guys my 2015 holiday gift guide ideas so
this is going to be a lot of different
things I have skin care I have makeup I
have hair care I've body care i have
purses i have tons of stuff to show you
and i think this would be great to give
to anybody whether it be your mom your
best friend your girlfriend your
whatever i think that these are some
really nice little ideas and i hope that
you guys enjoy so the first thing that
I'm going to start with our purses and I
do order my purses I am a VIP member
from justfab.com which is where you can
get purses for under fifty dollars each
month I get mine for 3995 because I am
on like a monthly schedule with them
basically and I end that like VIP East
like member status or whatever it is but
I just want to say really quickly I'm
not affiliated with them in any way I
know I've shown pictures on Instagram of
their purses and things like that it's
just because i really really do like the
brand but anyway the first one i want to
show you guys is kind of a new addition
to my collection and it's this beautiful
little periwinkle sort of bag it's
really really cute and I kind of just
hang it like right here on my arm or not
right there but you know like this I
kind of carry it like that like on my
wrist it's really cute you can't really
get it over your shoulder but I really
like the way this looks and they have so
many different styles on the website
they have satchels they have wallets
they have are not wallets but you know
what I mean like a little clutch kind of
things that look like a wallet there
like a two-in-one they have really big
bags they have everything this is
another one that I did show on my
Instagram I think it's so cute it is
black and white and like I said these
are really really nice and sturdy and
you can get every single person on their
website every single one on their
website is literally under fifty dollars
which i think is like a fantastic
fantastic deal so that is the first
thing that I want to share with you guys
next we are going to go into
few things that lip lovers would love
and I'm sorry if I'm like reaching over
here you guys I've so much stuff on the
counter I will be moving everything into
my beauty room once it's ready it's
almost ready you guys just hang in there
with me a little longer but anyway the
first thing I want to talk about is like
a little set from fresh they have these
sugar what are they called sugar tinted
lip treatments with SPF 15 this is for
the lip lover that loves like a tinted
bomb doesn't really love wearing
lipsticks or anything that's too opaque
these are so comfortable to wear on the
lips they come up with a set every
single year so last year set came with
six of them and they have this kind of
deluxe size packaging they're small but
these are all beautiful beautiful colors
and I believe this year set is the same
exact colors they may have added a few
new colors in but they're all really
kind of holiday related and they are
limited edition but this is a great
little set this one's called tulip it's
sort of a pinky color you have this one
called passion sort of a berry shade
this one is called cherry which is a red
you have very again which is kind of
like a berry shade let's see here I
guess passion is more of like a mixed
kind of berry and red shade mixed
together and then you have honey which
is kind of like a nude shade and then
you have pedal which is actually like
one of those your lips but better sort
of colors so I highly recommend this
little set you can get on the Sephora
com website again this is last year's so
they do have a little bit of color
differences in this year but that is
definitely for someone who love like lip
products that doesn't want something too
heavy on the lips and you know you get
to try different things out they do have
SPF they're wonderful the next thing I
want to talk about is for the people
that really really like full-on opaque
color with their lip products this these
are the bite Beauty double-ended
lipstick and they come in all sorts of
shades you can have ones that are really
really bright like Palomino and violet
and these are extremely extremely
vibrant and bright as you can see that
violet shade is very very purple and
then you can also do Palomino on the
other side which is beautiful really
really bright fuchsia color but they
have all sorts of colors they have
really really dark ones like mulberry
and scarlet I haven't
as well beautiful for fall and then they
have some nice ones like fig and date
which are very much very very like
neutral your lips but better sort of
shades as you guys can see so these are
fourteen dollars a piece on these two
for calm website and I think they're
just so fantastic because you know these
are so easy to travel with and I feel
like you can try out quite a bit of the
bite beauty product without having to go
and purchase one of their full size like
buttercream lipsticks or something which
are around twenty eight dollars so for
fourteen dollars you could pick up a few
of these for whoever you want to gift in
your life and I think they would really
like that so that is for someone who
really really likes opaque full-on color
because those are very pigmented um the
next thing I want to talk about are the
little tart lipsurgence kits that come
out during the holidays this is a mix of
this year set and also last year's by
the way this little container I found at
the dollar store and I just like to keep
my little tart lipsurgence the little
tiny deluxe sized ones in there because
I think it's so cute so you could even
get um the new one that they have right
now the new one that they have out right
now which is called the tart dressed to
the nines lipsett you could get that lip
set and then find a little container
like this put it in there and then wrap
it up in a gift and I think people would
absolutely love that or if you celebrate
Christmas you could throw these in as
stocking stuffers they're really really
cute but anyway I love the formula of
these they're really really beautiful
they're very easy to use because they
are like a big chubby cran basically the
formula looks like that but they go on
and they glide on really comfortably
they do smell kind of strongly admit so
if the person that you are gifting does
not like that then probably stay away
from these ones but again they do still
have that set out right now the dressed
to the nine set from Tarte I did do a
review on that if you guys are
interested i will like that video below
but anyway i think that these are
awesome they come in a lot of beautiful
kind of holiday esque sort of shades and
like i said if you want you can go and
get your own little container you don't
have to keep it in the box that it came
in and you can actually gift it in a
certain way that you would want to I
guess alright so those are the lip
products the next thing I want to talk
about our candles you can never go
around with candles
of course the person is very very
sensitive to fragrance but for the most
part a lot of people love candles I love
yankee candles these ones are awesome
they give up a lot of like a scent throw
like if you like one of these it will go
on and on and on this is taking me
forever to burn this is pumpkin wreath
of course you can get anything that's
like Christmas related Christmas scented
however I haven't picked up my Christmas
set yet but the other one I wanted to
talk about was um like a relaxing sort
of candle the bath and body works
aromatherapy candles are fantastic this
is the eucalyptus spearmint one and it
just smells so darn good and I think
that you can put together your own
little kits if you want to I wanted to
recommend for you guys also the
aromatherapy stress relief eucalyptus
spearmint pillow mist you could pair
these together and you know wrap them up
and you can even add in one of their you
know back soaks in the eucalyptus
spearmint sent or even one of their
luxury baths and you can make your
little own trio or quartet out of
products that you think somebody would
like and it can be like a little spa
gift basically so I wanted to mention
that to you guys because I think that
that would be a mazing idea i think a
lot of people would like that I know my
mom would love if I put like a candle
and some pillow mist and like a luxury
bath soak or something in there and
basically gave like a little spa gift
guide I don't know I have I'm cute i bet
she would probably like that or the nice
thing i want to talk about is jewelry
and I want to warn you guys right away
if you are sensitive to jewelry if you
cannot take cheap jewelry on like your
body and you get really sensitive or
things like that this is not for you but
I want to recommend forever 21 jewelry I
think it's fantastic I have two little
bracelets here that I think are adorable
I got these for two dollars and fifty
cents apiece they're really really cute
they're little bows and then um
yesterday's earrings I was wearing in my
video those are also from forever 21 let
me show you guys hold on they look like
this again these were three dollars and
fifty cents on their website really
really cute as well and then of course
they have really really pretty statement
necklaces like this one so i just wanted
to show you guys um
you can even get a lot of statement
jewelry or theatrical kind of jewelry
like the one I'm wearing today off of
ebay I got this at Duane Reade you can
get jewelry basically everywhere that's
a wonderful idea to throw into a
stocking as a stocking stuffer or I
don't know gifting your niece or
something or your daughter I don't know
I really really love forever 21 jewelry
and almost always wearing it that
basically yeah that basically makes up
like my whole collection of jewelry to
be completely honest probably wet seal
charlotte russe and forever 21 I love
their jewelry so if you are not
sensitive to jewelry i highly recommend
that all right moving on I want to talk
about masks because I think masks are
fantastic I think they're easy to wrap
up their already basically pre-wrapped
if you get the kinds like this that are
like sheet masks but you can get all
sorts of kind of masks and again you can
put together your own little like spa
gift box or something for someone that
you love and I think that they would
really really enjoy that I have tons of
different kind of things you have these
face wraps these are cucumber and
vitamin E and avocado and vitamin E
these are like sheet masks also you can
get on neck masks with pearl and coq10
things like that you can get refreshing
under I strips any kind of thing like
this somebody would really really love
I'm going to be bringing this for my mom
when I see her during the holidays this
is the arnica rose up flora flora p pi
flora like therapy but flora p strength
and energy sheet mask I think she's
really gonna love that you can even
think you can even get lip masks you
guys yes lip mask you guys know I love
that I play flute to my lips are always
chapped and they have like de callate
mass lots of things that you can get and
I think those are really fun because you
can pop them in the stocking or you can
wrap them up and like I said a little
gift bag or a little gift box or
something like that I think somebody
would really really love i also want to
recommend some of these like pre
packaged little like pod kind of masses
that makes sense sephora makes these
little jelly mask moisturizing and
energy like mono shots they look like
this it's like a one-time thing you can
put these in the refrigerator they
really really feel nice on your skin if
you have
hold them before like prior to use they
feel great on the skin super energizing
they smell really good they're awesome
and I also wanted to recommend the
overnight masks they have a set out
right now on the sephora.com website
where you can get I believe five of them
for like twenty dollars you can get the
lotus sleeping mask they have the honey
sleeping mask the ginseng one they're
all really really good and these ones
you sleep with overnight and they really
really make a difference in your skin in
the morning another little set that I
really really love is from origins again
you can find tons of stuff like this
right now on the ultracaan website on
the Sephora com website tons of little
tiny like trios of mass and things like
that for under $25 these ones from
origins are fantastic it has the out of
trouble mask it has the drink up
intensive math was mask which is amazing
and the clear improvement charcoal mask
so those are all really really awesome
and then I also want to tell you guys if
you were putting together a little spa
gift basket or a little present kind of
thing like that I love using am like a
facial spritz basically after putting on
my masks and also just with skincare in
the morning and at night you can even
use these to set your makeup if you want
the first one I want to recommend is the
Tasha luminous dewy skin missed this is
great for those of you with dry skin or
if you have a loved one or you know
whoever you're gifting if they have dry
skin they would love that dakota lee
beauty elixir is another really
wonderful one this one's from Shay Tara
this is the Moroccan rosewater with
Esther see this has like all natural
organic ingredients in it and then um
this one right here from tony moly this
is the pocket bunny moistness this would
be so cute in a stocking stuffer or in
anybody's like i don't know i would love
getting a gift like that look how cute
he is i don't even want to use him
because he's so cute but all of these
work really really well again they just
kind of moisturize your face they really
feel good when you put it on and
especially after a mask really really
great idea alright next I want to talk
about a few hair care products um oh gx
or the brand organics they're no longer
called organics I guess its just oh gx
now but they make these really really
nice small kind of travel friendly
little shampoos hair oils
I don't know things like that and i
recently picked up from Ulta I picked up
these two shampoos which I really like
the coconut water shampoo and the
coconut milk shampoo these are really
easy again great to throw as in as a
stocking stuffer you also could throw in
the anti-breakage serum or one of the
penetrating oil these are just fantastic
they're really small and easy sorry if
you hear me and dropping them on the
floor now just so I can kind of clear
off this area but those aren't really
really nice especially if you have
someone in your life that absolutely
loves like hair care items they would
probably really enjoy that alright josie
maran comes out with these little a
little trio of these whipped argan and
yeah whipped arkin body butters
basically every single year on the
sephora.com website there about fifteen
dollars it comes with the be spirited
the apricot vanilla and one other scent
I can't remember this is from last year
sent our last year's a kit but they
smell so good they're extremely
extremely moisturizing again a nice
little thing to use as a stocking
stuffer or just to wrap up and put in
the little bag really really great they
do come in a cute little sleeve so you
could even keep it in the packaging that
it comes in but really really nice
really really hydrating and I also want
to mention the ones from the body shop
they come out every single year with a
kit of like five of these for i believe
around $35 which is really really good
because the full size of these are quite
expensive but this is a nice amount and
you get to try out all the different
sense so if you know someone who loves
body butters you know i don't know like
pampering themselves things like that
they would probably really like that
also for the people who love to pamper
themselves the bath and body works
aromatherapy luxury baths oh my gosh i
love the formulation of these these are
beautiful you pour them into your bath
and they just make like a really nice
beautiful like therapeutic sort of thing
going on I don't know they make a little
bit of bubbles but they also really
really moisturize your body they have
essential oils in them so they kind of
soothe your mind they just are honestly
amazing it's like different than any
sort of bubble bath and they are a
little pricey you do want to get them
when they are on sale for half off
normally they are sixteen dollars and
fifty cents a piece which is like I said
pricey
but if you can get them when they're
half off there around eight dollars this
one is the eucalyptus spearmint which is
a lovely scent I feel like everybody
really really enjoys that scent and then
also I have the eucalyptus t1 I actually
have one in every single cent from the
aromatherapy line but I didn't feel like
bringing them all out here um at the
other two things I want to recommend
from the aromatherapy line are the bath
soaps if you don't think that they want
bubbles in their bath the bath soaps are
amazing they really really kind of
soothe any sort of aching muscles you
may have and again I feel like anybody
could love this and I feel like you have
more time around the holidays to kind of
pamper yourself and take time for
yourself because a lot of people have
time off from work and this is a great
way to pamper someone so yes I highly
recommend those i do want to let you
guys know because those are quite pricey
if you don't want to pay for you know
those if they are sixteen dollars and
fifty cents or even eight dollars the
regular bath and body works signature
collection bubble baths are fantastic as
well this is the japanese cherry blossom
scent it's really lovely you can get
these in every single cent that they
come out with and these are really nice
they make really really a lot of bubbles
it's really really fun and again these
are normally twelve dollars but when
they're half off they're literally like
I don't know these go down to like three
dollars and fifty cents apiece sometimes
on the website so highly recommend
checking that out um along with bath
products these tree hut Shea sugar
scrubs are fantastic these are my all
time favorite favorite favorite scrubs
you can get these for under ten dollars
apiece on the altar com website and they
often are buy one get one fifty percent
off which is amazing you get them in
tons and tons of different scents and
again I feel like they all this kind of
like that stuff goes together like
pampering yourself around the holidays
you have more time really really a
lovely thing to gift this one is passion
fruit and guava very very sweet smelling
amazing and the other one I have is a
little more like warm like the scent is
a little more warm and lovely for the
fault in winter it is Hawaiian Kukui so
I love both of those and i do want to
mention a few of bubble bars from lush
as well if you guys saw my call recently
you saw that i hauled these basically
this is the comforter bubble bar these
are wonderful because they're very very
nourishing
and they make your bathwater look really
pretty and I think a lot of people would
like these you could make it your own
and wrap them in like saran wrap and put
like a little bow around it or gifted
however you want to but they smell
amazing you can use it multiple times
you can like take little chunks and cut
it up you could even cut this in half
and gift it to two different people if
you wanted to but I recommend that one
and also this other one I think it's
called candy bar or something like that
really really cute it has like a little
flower thing in the middle smells
amazing you know if you go into lush you
can just find a bunch of stuff that I
mean you can find a cent for everybody
it's what I mean and they also do have
their own little gift sets and things
like that so highly recommend checking
that out I want to talk about hand
creams really quickly i recently picked
up a little quartet of hand creams from
Lucy town this was on the sephora.com
website this one comes with the cherry
blossom won the Rose one the almond one
which is in the other room because I've
been using that this week and then just
the dry skin hand cream which is just
the shea butter sent these are fantastic
and I feel like everybody loves hand
creams so if you want to get a little
kit like this they're under twenty
dollars if you know someone who gets
very very dry skin or has eczema they'd
probably love that and a cheaper
alternative are the bath and Bodyworks
nourishing hand creams you can get this
in a scent that you know somebody
already loves like if you know they love
the black cherry Merlot hand soap you
could also get them the hand cream so I
wanted to mention that as well oh you
guys this black cherry Merlot scent from
bath and body works is fantastic
definitely one of my winter favorites
alright another kind of Bath a product
that I want to talk about I got this
little quartet from Sephora calm and
philosophy comes out with these every
single year they have different ones on
the altar calm website you can get like
six of them for around the same price
but they do come in a smaller size but
these are adorable these are there three
in one shampoo shower gels and bubble
baths and what's cute about these is
that first of all you can use them when
you're traveling a lot of people travel
for the holidays i know i do and i will
be taking this one with me when i travel
for christmas I've already decided but
these are fantastic because they're your
shampoo you can use them as a shower gel
and you can use them as a bubble bath so
it's like it's just wonderful for travel
and also it's really cute they actually
put the recipe for whatever is like on
the front of the packaging they put it
on the front here so you can actually
make the pumpkin icing or you can make
vanilla bean nutmeg or you can make
fresh cream or a spice cinnamon stick
you know it's like really really cute
and all the scents are holiday related
so I highly recommend checking out those
little kids that they come out with I
believe that one for those four was
around twenty eight dollars on the
support calm website but like I said
they have different ones in store they
have different ones at Ulta you can find
tons of stuff like that and again you
could break all four up and put them
into stocking stuff you know into
stockings as stocking stuffers do
whatever you want so I love those the
next thing I want to talk about is
perfumes so the first thing I want to
say is Bath and Body Works has these
really really cute while I'm going to
talk about fragrance mist first so these
aren't like perfumes they're basically
fragrance mist but they're really fun to
pair with perfumes and also if you have
like a daughter or something and you
don't really want her wearing perfumes
yet these are a great great option again
I pair these with my perfumes just to
kind of step up a notch of smelling good
I guess but these are really cute these
are the bath and Bodyworks holiday
traditions they don't come any gift set
or anything but you can buy them
separately and they really really go on
sale i believe around the holidays these
go down to one dollar and fifty cents a
piece so the first one is vanilla bean
noel and they just have adorable
packaging and they smell so good and
then again you could pair it with like
your the person's favorite candle like
they love the vanilla bean oil candle
you could get that and also a bubble
bath or shower gel things like that they
have Mary marshmallow this one I love
it's cranberry twinkle you guys have
probably seen these in some of my weekly
favorites videos and twisted peppermint
so really really cute holiday packaging
again they go down to a very very low
price i got those last year for i
believe a dollar fifty apiece and that
was not even after the holidays that was
before that was around Christmastime so
those are really cute you can package
them all up together put them in
stocking whatever you want to do other
another brand that has wonderful
wonderful fragrance mist is victoria
secret oh my gosh if you love
sweet-smelling miss and you don't really
want like anything holiday related these
are so good or if you know somebody who
doesn't really necessarily want
something holiday-related these are
amazing mango temptation is one of my
favorites its a mix of mango nectar and
hibiscus they also have like pear glass
a you know these just smells so good and
you can get these for what's that deal
that they do like six for 24 or
something like that and they probably
have even more deals I'm starting
tomorrow on black friday so and also
endless love is another favorite of mine
and this is a mix of apple blossom and
yang Yang so really really yummy and
then perfume wise i do want to mention
these ones from pacifica these are
really really affordable perfumes these
are 22 dollars a piece on the altar com
website or on the Pacifica website and
they are all natural and they smell so
good and last all day the first 1i have
is Tahitian gardenia it looks like this
really really cute and oh my gosh I'm
amazed at how long these last on me
because they are all natural I just
didn't really think they'd have a very
good like staying power but they do they
last all day so if you have a perfume
lover in your life they would probably
like these a lot you could get three of
them for sixty dollars which is a great
deal Pacifica this one is the Indian
coconut nectar this one smells really
really luscious very very warm and
lovely and i also have brazilian mango
grapefruit so if you do have a perfume
lever perfume a perfume lover in your
life i highly recommend checking those
out alright moving on I want to talk
about a few tools beauty tools the first
one I want to talk about that I have not
really talked about that much on my
channel is my derma roller this is a
micro needling system this helps with
acne scars it helps with
hyperpigmentation it helps with just
overall unevenness of texture on your
face so if you know someone who has acne
scars or deals with acne um you don't
really want to use this if you have like
erupted acne like if you constantly have
breakouts on your face you don't want to
use this because this will hurt uh-huh
this hurts in general I want to tell you
guys right away this does hurt in
general but if you know someone who had
acne or severe acne and they're left
with a lot of scars this is a wonderful
wonderful thing to pick up it looks like
this and you can choose out the
different kind of needles that you want
to use so there are longer needles
shorter needles i recommend starting out
with the 1.0 mm and i got this on amazon
it was quite cheap but if you know
someone who just you know kind of has
issues with texture on their skin or
they really want to help with acne
scarring things like that especially
pitted acne scarring this would be a
lovely little tool to get them another
one I want to talk about is this little
Revlon it's like a petty egg sort of
thing this is lovely i use this all the
time it has like this little um
softening part here and then you open it
up and you just rub this on your heel
and i'm telling you it takes up all the
calluses and all the dry skin it's
really really gross when you empty it
out you have to open it and kind of
empty it out it's like you but i think a
lot of people would like this and again
if you were putting together a little
spa box or something like that you guys
would probably you know someone would
love having that in there and then the
last thing i want to talk about is the
clarisonic in this category this is my
clarisonic mia i got this for
ninety-nine dollars i have had the
clarisonic pro before this as well i
think they all are the same thing all
you really need to do if you want
something different is change out the
head the head that i have on here right
now is the luxe head it's the really
really silky soft one this is nice if
you have sensitive skin and also if you
don't want too much of a deep clean i
highly recommend that brush head but
right now they have a lot of deals only
sephora.com website you can get this for
ninety-nine dollars with like two full
sizes of facial cleanser things like
that anybody would love to get this as a
gift it really really helps to clean the
skin to like a whole nother level you
will have an initial period of your skin
kind of purging it shouldn't last that
long though I know my friend leora
actually had some issues with hers
lasting longer than like a month and I
have heard of that happening before but
try and stick it out and if it's not for
you you can always return it but
definitely a must-have for me and so I
thought I would just mention that and
then now we are finally going to get
into the last category here I'm sorry
guys this took kind of a long time but I
really want to show you guys some ideas
and gift you know give me that you can
pick up so we're going to talk about
eyeshadow palettes
so I'm going to start with a drugstore
this is the NYX butt naked underneath it
all palette this has 15 eyeshadows for
blushes and three illuminators in it I
have the first one as well they came out
with a like an original one just called
the butt naked and that is more for like
neutral colors if you have a neutral
lover in your life these are really
really well priced and this is kind of
their newer one that they recently
released I've been actually using this
all week so if you're wondering what's
on my face today it is this so this is
an awesome awesome like go to you know
run all that on the run I can't talk on
the run sort of palette it's like my
go-to when I just can't be bothered to
be digging through my drawers and
finding all these separate things this
is awesome so yes this is what I've been
wearing all week I think it's beautiful
and have a lot of gorgeous gorgeous
colors for fall for winter and I highly
highly recommend that and I am going to
show you guys some high-end luxury
eyeshadow palettes as well that i really
like but this one is awesome and priced
at a very very good like range basically
all right another thing I want to talk
about are these elf prism I shadow
palettes I think if you through these
into like a stocking yeah like a
stocking if somebody would love this
this is like six dollars a piece I
believe each pallet is yeah around six
dollars a piece this one is called smoke
so that is for anybody who loves really
really smoky colors they also have this
one which is called naked which is
basically just a very very neutral kind
of basic everyday sort of natural colors
and then you also have this one called I
believe it's called sunset it has like
pinky tones in it yeah really really
beautiful so um you could throw all
three of these into a little bag with
like some I don't know like tissue paper
sticking out or something you really
could make it your own you can even just
pop them into three of I don't know your
daughter's stood you know stopping or
whatever stockings yeah I'm sorry guys
I'm like literally it's been 27 minutes
now and I am literally just like oh I'm
overwhelmed I'm done with talking but
yes you could throw these into stockings
and use them as stocking stuffers
whatever you want to do but i highly
recommend these little pallets are very
cheap and cheerful and awesome
and then the other low end eyeshadow
little I guess these are kind of like
quartets or quads this is like the
artist Thomas is called the eyeshadow
palettes from also these are like the
artist artistry palace that's what it's
called you get three of them for twenty
dollars again perfect for popping in the
you know stocking or doing whatever you
want with them they're really gorgeous
they are kind of like a duplicate when
you look at them they are a duplicate
for the hourglass or do they called
modernist I shadow palettes so really
really beautiful love the colors and I
actually really love the pigmentation
everything on these I do have a video on
them I will link below as well so those
are some drum store eyeshadows like
pellets and little kits that I recommend
if you don't want to go and spend the
big bucks but I am going to talk a
little bit about some high-end I shadow
palettes that I love that our limited
edition so the first one is the Stila
trust and love gift set this is on sale
right now at Ulta on the altar com
website for $28 yes you heard that
correctly twenty-eight dollars you get
some gorgeous eyeshadows in here you get
a Stila lip plays and then I don't have
the mascara because I just decluttered
it in one of my declutter videos and I'm
actually donating it but this is what it
looks like the shades are absolutely
gorgeous and normally this is forty
dollars but like I said twenty eight
dollars right now on the altar calm
website a great great little kit to have
it is limited edition and it looks like
a little like with the gold like an
envelope I think it's adorable alright
the second one I want to talk about this
also limited edition and it is $59 I
believe this is the lorac mega pro 2
palette amazing absolutely gorgeous you
get a bunch of matte shades on the top
and shimmers on the bottom there it is
absolutely stunning look at it in its
all its glory oh I love this this is
probably the one that I would get out of
any three of the top like high-end ones
that I'm talking about right now the
texture and formulation of these shadows
is unbeatable so smooth so creamy
absolutely amazing and then I also
wanted to talk about the vice for
palette from urban decay if you know
someone in your life that loves a pop of
color things like that they would
absolutely
we absolutely love this one oh let me
get it all right this is what it looks
like on the outside very pretty and then
on the inside of look at these pops of
color isn't that gorgeous so if you know
someone who loves pops of color they
would definitely definitely love this
particular palette so anyway you guys

sorry i started stumbling over my words

videos just kind of got to keep going um
