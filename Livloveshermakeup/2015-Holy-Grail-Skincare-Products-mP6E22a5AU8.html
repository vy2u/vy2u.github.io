thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a fantastic day so
far i am here to share my 2015 holy
grail skincare products with you guys
today i am sharing everything from face
cleansers to moisturizers masks um
makeup remover products eye cream stuff
like that these are the top of the top
for me for this past year and I thought
it would be fun to share with you guys I
do have quite a big skincare collection
it's not as big as my makeup collection
I will be filming a full skincare
collection video in January if you guys
want to see the whole collection but I
do have quite a bit and I like to swap
it out weekly so the fact that these
products are used on a weekly basis or
an everyday basis set a lot and yet
they're basically just favorites for the
year so let's get started the first
product I want to talk about busy boscia
makeup break up cool cleansing oil this
is my favorite way to remove a my makeup
this is a new bottle right here and the
reason it is is because it has like a
cushion like effect on the skin and it's
like an oil so it's not going to be
pulling and tugging at your face I do
love me some native remover wipes you
guys probably see a lot of those in my
empties videos however i have to say
those are a lot more abrasive and i
noticed that i really pull and tug when
i'm using those i only really use those
when I'm not using this and i'm too lazy
to wash my face at the sink with this um
you put this on dry skin and you
basically massage it all over and then
you have to rinse your face and
sometimes i'm just not in the mood to
rinse my face so that's when I've use
makeup remover wipes I do not have a
specific makeup remover wipes that I
have like in this video because I like a
ton of different brands I'd like to try
me once but anyway this is my favorite
way to remove my makeup I have been
using it all year I absolutely adore it
I probably gone through six of these in
the past year like bottles the full size
and I think it's just totally awesome I
have no like a residue on my face after
there's no oily cast everything just
comes off when you put the water on and
it's fantastic so the first definite
favorite of 2015 skincare wise is the
potion makeup break up quote fencing oil
another product that you can use to
remove makeup um and my second favorite
is the simple micellar cleansing water
this cleanses it removes makeup and also
hydrates you can use this to remove all
your makeup at night or you can use it
to remove like residual make up in the
morning which is what I personally do I
use this when I get out of the shower at
night when I have like little bits of
eye makeup left over and also in the
morning when I have little bits of eye
makeup left over this is really nice to
cleanse your skin in the morning if you
don't have time to wash your face at the
sink it's just a fantastic products it
doesn't leave any sticky sort of residue
on my face I just don't like that with
my seller waters when they leave kind of
a sticky you know cast on your face I
don't like that at all this makes my
skin feel really hydrated really really
beautiful and nice and soft so that is
my second favorite I feel like this is
the favorites video but you guys know
what I mean favorites for the year the
next one I want to talk about is from
Mazur leak you guys have probably seen
me go through multiple bottles of this
this is the rosewater balancing miss
this is just one of those items that you
definitely don't need in your skin care
routine it's really just one of those
like high maintenance steps it's
something that I spray on my face after
my skincare routine in the morning and
also after my skincare routine at night
it just locks in all the products that I
put on my face I feel like it gives kind
of a seal and it also just hydrates my
skin beautifully it doesn't make the
oily in any sort of way and I really
really love it I think I have found a
dupe for this product so i probably will
be doing a video on that but still this
one has definitely been my favorite i
probably gone through seven of these in
the past year alright the next product I
want to talk about has been the one eye
cream that has just been so consistent
this whole year for me this is the
yesterday fruit dark circle correcting
eye cream this is not a heavy eye cream
it's not going to help with fine lines
or wrinkles it's not going to help with
smoothing or anything like that it's
very lightweight it has a little bit of
a tinted like color to it it's got a
little bit of a Yeller yellow undertone
and that really helps to color correct
with dark circles I reach for this very
very often in the morning I don't use it
at night only in the morning it does
smell like grapefruit it's wonderful but
it actually does what it says it's going
to do it actually does make your dark
circles look less like I guess
if that makes sense it really really
does diminish the appearance of dark
circles it doesn't claim to do anything
else and I feel like it does the job so
this is definitely my favorite eye cream
of the year all right let's get into
some cleansers as far as cleansing both
in the morning if I don't want to use a
scrub on my face I normally do use the
scrub in the morning but if I don't want
to and I want to use just a facial
cleanser the one I reach for the most
often is definitely the clean and clear
morning burst facial cleanser this is
oil-free it has bursting beads that with
you up it rinses clean has vitamin C and
ginseng I love this stuff it smells
amazing it really really wakes me up
like I feel very refreshed when I use
this my skin feels energized I feel
energized because it smells really good
it smells like oranges it's just really
really lovely and it really does rinse
clean i have no residue on my skin it
gets off all of like the night before
you know i have like a bunch of stuff on
my face i feel kind of grimy in the
morning you know what I mean this gets
all the grime off it's amazing I
absolutely love this and it's very very
cheap and cheerful at the drugstore so
that is what I have been reaching for
this whole year when I want to wash my
face in the morning and I don't want to
use a scrub when I do want to use the
scrub um the one that's probably I mean
I have so many scrubs but this is the
one that's the most consistent and
definitely my favorite it is the garden
a clean plus a blackhead eliminating
scrub it in clogs pores it has charcoal
in it it clears the complexion is for
oily skin it is oil free and I was 2
percent salicylic acid in an awesome
awesome scrub it smells amazing it's got
really really nice particles for
exfoliating the face it makes my skin
look clearer and it also just makes it
really really nice and soft at before
putting on my makeup so I love that in
the morning the next product I'm going
to talk about to cleansers that I like
to use at night I like to use benzoyl
peroxide on my face at night I do have
hormonal acne around my jawline and I
have like leftover scars and things like
that and I just like to combat it with
benzoyl peroxide at night that really
really works well for my skin the first
cleanser that I love and I've been using
this since I was in high school this is
the clear pore cleanser / mask is from
Neutrogena it's got three point five
percent benzoyl peroxide it's awesome
really really great you can use it as a
cleanser or leave it on and you know use
it as an
but it is a fantastic product really
helps keep my skin clear and then the
second one I want to talk about is
actually not this one it is like the
sister product to this one I tried this
one and I don't like it nearly as much
but the one I'm talking about is he
clean and clear it's the advantage one
but it is the ten percent formula this
is the five percent and this one has
exfoliating beads in it I don't like it
as much I don't think the exfoliating
beads do as much however the ten percent
formula that doesn't have the
exfoliating beads is definitely a
favorite it's the sister product to this
this is why I'm showing it but this one
has five percent the ten percent one oh
my gosh that really really helps with
hormonal acne or just any acne you might
have in general make sure you do
moisturize your face at night so that
you don't get all dried out though all
right let's move on to some moisturizers
as far as oils go this year I definitely
been reaching for my L'Oreal H perfect
Glo renewal facial oil of the most it
looks like this in half a blend of I
think six different oils in it it's got
like argon oil bunch of different things
in it it smells amazing it makes my
makeup glide on so smoothly and I don't
need to pair this with any sort of
moisturizer it just really really
moisturizes my skin by itself so that
has definitely been my favorite has a
nice little dropper and I literally have
only gone through like that much you
guys can see that and I have had this
for a whole year I literally got this
last January so it's amazing it lasts a
long time definitely definitely worth
the money I highly recommend checking
that out it definitely gives your skin a
glow and a sheen is absolutely beautiful
as far as like actual moisturizers go
definitely my Neutrogena hydroboost
water gel this has hyaluronic acid in it
it's fantastic it's got a wonderful
consistency literally like water and
they do have one that's a gel cream
version so that one is a little better
if you have dry skin I do have
combination skin by the way probably
should have said that at the beginning
of the video but this is beautiful it
says it instantly crunches skin and
keeps it looking smooth supple and
hydrated all day long it's oil-free
non-comedogenic it's awesome I've never
had any issues with this product I love
it in the morning I think it's just
absolutely beautiful and then the last
thing I want to talk
about in the moisturizer category for
the morning is the polished choice
resist moisture renewal oil booster you
guys have probably seen me feature this
little guy in favorites videos numerous
times I use this every single day as
long as I'm not wearing a facial oil I
will mix this in with any sort of
moisturizer so whether it be the
Neutrogena hydro boost or Neutrogena
hydro boost or any other moisturizer I
will mix three drops of this in it has
ceramides in it it's got argan oil in it
it just boosts the moisture content of
any sort of product that you're using so
it's absolutely wonderful I absolutely
absolutely love that rabbit and then at
nighttime as far as like treatments go
something that I use consistently has
been the Neutrogena ageless intensives
anti-wrinkle deep wrinkle night
moisturizer this has a small amount of
retinol in it it does not irritate your
skin whatsoever i do have combination
skin but i do get a little sensitive
especially with retinol i cannot use
anything that's prescription anything
like the polished choice 1% retinol was
too much for my skin this has the
perfect amount and i really do see a
difference when i use it it's not greasy
um you just need to put what does it say
a pearl sized amount evenly over face
using Gentle upward strokes so you push
it into your face really lovely i can
use it around my eye area it doesn't
sting i noticed a huge difference when i
use this on my skin every night and then
i'll top it with any sort of moisturizer
that i want because this is not super
super moisturizing it's just a treatment
but it really really has helped with
fine lines it's helped tighten up my
skin it's helped clear my complexion and
also it's helped with acne scars so that
has been on my favorite treatment for
nighttime use for this year and then the
final product i want to talk about it
was really hard for me to pick out a
mask i have quite the mask collection
face mask collection and i did recently
a video on my top five favorite face
masks and this was in there but i
thought about you know all those masks
and I thought what did I reach for the
most often and it was definitely this
one from peter thomas roth this is the
rose stem cell biol repaired gel mask it
is a cutting-edge plant biotechnology at
isolates and replicates five perfect
reparative rope stem cells it helps just
you know
I don't know it helps reduce the look of
fine lines and wrinkles we generates
rejuvenates hydrates brightens firms and
tones the skin it's beautiful it's a
pink jelly and it smells amazing a
smells like rose and that is what it
looks like you get so much in here you
barely need anything you can use this at
the nighttime moisturizer you can use
this as a face mask you can put in the
fridge and have a really really nice
like cooling face mask it's wonderful I
can use it on my skin when my skin is
really oily during the summer I can use
it on my skin during the winter when my
skin is really dry it does amazing
amazing things and makes my skin feel so
smooth so that has definitely been my
favorite mask of the year alright guys
