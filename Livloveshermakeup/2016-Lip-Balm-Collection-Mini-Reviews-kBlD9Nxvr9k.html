today's video or at least in one of my
videos I'm sharing the key guys my lip
balm collection these are all just
regular lip balms that aren't tinted or
have any color to them there may be a
few in here that maybe had a little bit
of tint but they're mostly like the
Carey grin and the Tony moly but they
mostly are just products that I use on
my lips just to moisturize not to put
any color on or anything like that so I
mostly use a lot of these at nighttime
and also before I put on my lip color in
the morning so I just want to say really
quickly I didn't film this particular
video when I did my collection series
I'll link my collection series for this
year down below I do a collection series
every single year on my channel and yeah
I do all of those in January I didn't
really want to do this because I didn't
know if it would be of interest of you
guys of interests I cannot speak I
didn't know if you guys would be
interested in it basically because
they're just lip balms but in my fails
and Halle granules a couple of weeks ago
I mentioned that if you guys want me to
do a lip balm collection plus many
reviews that I could do that and a lot
of you said yes so we are doing that
today and yeah I'm just going to walk
you guys through these I'm gonna take
these little lids off right here these
are the little containers that I store
them in and if you see my flute over
there it is earring out right now
because I had a concert tonight so I
have all of my Easter mints and music
out because I want to let them air dry
because some of the instruments are wood
anyway so I'm just going to walk you
guys through these and then I'm gonna
put them in the little bins as we go
along
I'll give you mini reviews and what else
did I want to say oh I have a few lip
balms that I carry in my purse and also
that are like next to my bedside table
and also the one I'm using currently
this week is the glam glow wet mud so I
won't be showing those but I will be
talking about that anyway in my files
and hot oils at the end of the week so
let's get started the first lip balm I
have here is the Nivea lip butter
vanilla and macadamia kiss I really like
these Nivea lip butters they are really
really nice on the lips and they
honestly smell like that from Body Works
candles this one is caramel cream kiss
and then I also have I believe the
raspberry wine where is it here it is I
have the raspberry rose a kiss which is
also really nice and then I just have
the regular version this is probably my
least
just because I think they smell so good
and I really like something that smells
really nice and tastes really good on my
lips so I highly recommend those from
the drugstore i i have personally had
them for I think over like two or three
years now and they're still completely
good and fine alright so the next item I
have here is one of these little gos lip
balms I have like a love-hate
relationship with these I think they are
somewhat good they have a little bit of
a waxy consistency which makes it hard
for me to practice my flute when I'm
wearing them but this one was the
coconut milk scent or flavor and it's
pretty darn good and then I do have some
little vos knockoffs here these are from
I believe Walgreens no I'm sorry this is
actually an EOS this is the pomegranate
one I like that one more than the
coconut milk these are the little
Walgreens knockoffs I actually like
these more this one is watermelon and
this one wait this one's watermelon this
one's strawberry they have the same look
to them they actually moisturize a lot
better and I don't find that they're
super oily and waxy on my lips so I
prefer these and they taste like ten
times better
alright I have some little lip balms
here so this one is from Tony moly this
is the cherry lip balm it has a little
bit of a red tint to it it's really
really nice I do like it quite a bit and
I have its little twin sister or a
partner in crime in my purse and that is
the peach lip balm which is also really
good and then this one is from is this
also from Tony moly no this is from Bath
and Body Works it's just a strawberry
lip balm I like it it's not amazing it's
just okay these I really really adore
these are the Tony moly and B bow or bow
bow I think it's called kiss kiss lip
balms this one is in a blueberry and
then this one isn't honey these are so
so so nice I definitely have a petroleum
like consistency to them so they're
really really nice for overnight
treatment another really nice product
for overnight treatment are these little
Vaseline lip therapy x' this one is the
rosy lips it smells a little bit like
rose and it does leave a little bit of a
rosy hint on your lips and then I also
have the cocoa butter one I have no idea
if it's out here right now like I said
some of the bombs I store in like
separate places around the house and I
didn't want to click to all of them
because then I'll forget to put them
back so next I have these little Josie
Maran Argan ball a lot our
on balls I was gonna say argon balls
that just that just sounded mom
argon bombs this is in the sweet citrus
scent I also have the vanilla apricot
the vanilla apricot is amazing it's my
favorite I love that scent from josie
maran so I do like those they can
actually be used anywhere on your body
they're just a really nice sort of waxy
consistency and I do kind of prefer them
when my lips are really sort of chafing
if that makes sense I have another
little bath and Bodyworks a lip balm and
that one is a little green apple I have
the Bhoots extracts coconut lip balm
this is really nice it actually really
mimics coconut oil it is kind of hard
when you put your finger in and then it
just turns into an oil on your lips very
very moisturizing I like this a lot too
this is the Korres lip butter in the
Jasmine scent this gives a little bit of
a new tint to the lips it's really nice
nothing that I would like to think of as
you know my daily lip product or
anything like that but I do like to wear
it overnight and it does taste really
good I am obsessed with these Carrie
Graham lip lips I have a lot of these I
think I have two more sitting around in
the house this particular one is in the
shade radiant and this one is like a
dark berry color and this is let's see
here peppermint flavored really really
good love the consistency on these they
are completely natural I can practice my
flute with them on they're just so
comfortable and they moisturize the heck
out of your lips without having anything
like petroleum jelly or any unnatural
ingredients in them they feel like they
on petroleum jelly but they don't and
then this one is Marsala this is like a
deep deep like black currant sort of
color and then this one is just just a
regular one and no this one is cinnamon
with the pimento berry it smells really
really good I love anything cinnamon so
I like that a lot the next one I have
here is the icon where is this from
again I always forget where this is from
you guys this is the overnight renewal
therapy I believe it's from My Goddess
that drugstore brand and I can't
remember not Eucerin neosporin that's
why I never remember I did not know that
they have lip balms neosporin overnight
renewal therapy it has white petroleum
lip protectant in it it is amazing I
used this before Big Show's I used it
last night it's great I have a few of
these little soft lip
cubes here it's so nice I like to wear
them underneath kind of to prime my lips
before I put my lip product on for the
day so this one is the mint one and then
this one is the warm vanilla sugar I
have a few of these Burt's Bees lip
balms right here I took the wrappers off
they just started to come off anyway but
I have the grapefruit one I have the
hmmm what is this
pomegranate and then this one is the
mango one they're really nice they have
a little bit of a waxy consistency to
them so if you do want to layer a lip
color on top just be aware of that
because it might break through a little
bit one of my all-time favorites here is
the bite Beauty agave lip mask its
website down this is amazing Holy Grail
product for sure love that I would say
that the neosporin and also the Carrie
ground those are like amazing alright
here I have the Palmer's cocoa butter
formula swivel stick this smells really
good it's nice it's super super big and
chubby but it is nice to touch up the
Nivea a kiss of cherry I really like
these I also have the milk and honey and
I also have this one which is the berry
swirl these are all really really nice
they smell good and I like to wear them
underneath lip colors in the morning and
then I have lip smackers here I am
obsessed with lip smackers they really
moisturize and they taste so dang good
so I have dr. pepper here I have the
grape fun tattoo on my bunk and then I
have the strawberry Fanta
I have this one oh my god it smells so
good this is the white chocolate lemon
oh it's amazing this one's amazing too
these are all like the cake ones this is
strawberries and cream and then I have
the coca-cola vanilla one I also have
these fonta orange I have the root beer
I have sprite I have coke I have oh my
god that sounded wrong Coca Cola
flavored or Coca Cola scented and sprite
scented or flavored I love lip smackers
they're amazing this one is let's see
here vanilla buttercream and then also I
have red velvet a royal red velvet the
smell amazing lip smackers really
are very nice on the lips they
moisturize like crazy I'm a flutist and
I'm constantly you know reapplying
throughout the day I love lip smackers I
feel like they're very underrated all
right I have this chapstick total
hydration I don't even think I've opened
this yet so I can't really say anything
about it I have the Moline + goo it's
this is the mojito lip balm yes I do
like it um Tom has one too he really
likes it it's just okay I don't think
it's amazing but it does taste good this
is the Nivea a kiss of olive oil and
lemon again really like these Nivea
balms and I do like that one a lot I
didn't think I would like olive oil and
lemon together but it actually smells
and tastes really good alright I have
two of the are thief the quenched from
Baby Lips I believe these are quenched
yeah these are just the completely clear
baby lip balms I love baby lips so I
have to have those around I have the
fresh sugar lips serum I have not tried
this yet I don't know why it's in there
I have this pur Lisse daily lip nourish
or with mango and shea butter I hate
this
so probably be too cluttering that soon
I have the hemp epic blend coconut lip
balm I'm gonna hold on to that because I
need to start using that a little more
it's been sitting around for a while
another Nivea this is a kiss of mint and
minerals this is so yummy during the
holidays chapstick Gingerbread kiss I'm
very very nice I like the chapstick
formulation so I'm sure that I'll like
the other one and then the Burt's Bees
pumpkin spice the smelt were really
really nice and the holidays again
formula is a little slippery so just be
careful and then I haven't tried this
yet this is the dentist CEOs wcl soul
I don't know delicios lip balm and this
has I don't know it looks like it's
going to be like candy scented or
flavored so we'll see about that
again chapstick I feel like chapstick is
just a really really nice and basic oh
there's that other little Vaseline lip
therapy tub this is the cocoa butter
wine I've used more of this and then the
other one really really good and then
this is new to me this is the pharmacy
lip bloom in the strawberry basil scent
absolutely amazing love-love-love tastes
really really good and smells good so
let's put the lid back on here so like I
said I probably have maybe 10 or 15 more
bombs just laying around the house I
just didn't want to pull them out
because a lot of them are doubles
overall I would say my favorites are the
Kari grant liquids
I like the newest foreign white
petroleum jelly the by PD agave lip mask
and I really like the Korres lip butter
