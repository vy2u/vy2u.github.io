thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a fantastic day i'm
very excited for this video this is a
collaboration / tag video started here
by Ellis for living on youtube or l she
asked me if i would like to collaborate
with her and about 10 to 15 other
wonderful wonderful ladies here and do a
2016 makeup use up video so basically
we're going through our makeup stash and
picking out products that we have not
really reached for lately or products
that we want to get through or products
that need to get through before they go
bad things like that and it's just a
really great way to get people to look
at their makeup stash and look at their
collection and kind of see what they're
not using and get into those products so
i picked up out about i think 16
products and i tried to go in every
category so some are like I shadows
highlighters um you know foundations I
chef and eyeshadows all that kind of
stuff I already said that but yeah you
get the picture um but anyway I just
want to thank else so much for allowing
me to do this collaboration with you and
all these lovely ladies it is a tag
video so I tagged all of you on anybody
that is watching and also i do want to
take a few people specifically my friend
leora from lee auras makeup loves 52 meg
bernardo kristen from mama loves mascara
and Hayley row 27 and also jessica from
allister's travels I will leave all of
their channels below as well and I would
love for you guys to do this video and
look through your makeup stash and share
what you would like to use up for the
year so anyway um let's just get started
shall we the first thing I would like to
get through and use app is this bobby
brown SPF 25 tinted moisturizing balm my
shade is alabaster tint I have had this
for a very long time and I just don't
reach for it often I think the reason I
don't is because I thought it was going
to have a lot more coverage than it
actually does the actual coverage is
very very much like a tinted moisturizer
or like a tinted balm so it would be
really really great for those with
mature skin because it's super super
humectant and moisturizing however I
just don't reach for this very often so
what I was
is that I could use this basically as a
tinted moisturizer underneath the
foundation that I want to wear so I'm
really going to try and use this this
was a very pricey product around sixty
or seventy dollars so there's no reason
why I shouldn't be trying to get through
it so yeah that is the first product the
second product is a concealer or
correcting cream this is from it
cosmetics this is the bye-bye redness
neutralizing correcting cream I just
don't reach for this very often and I
really should because it's a fantastic
product it does look a little dark
however it really really does counteract
redness on the skin and any sort of
hyperpigmentation you might have dark
circles you name it this can do it and I
mean this can cover it basically and I
really really love this product and I
would like to reach for it more so that
is the second product the third product
is actually a blush it is from gosh
cosmetics this is the multi color blush
in a number fifty pink pie it looks like
this and there's little pieces it's like
literally like a piece of pie and
there's tiny little pie pieces and when
you mix these all together you get a
beautiful kind of burgundy pink color
that has a ton of iridescent to it and I
feel like I really could wear this all
year long and I forgot to mention that L
does want us to do a check-in video
halfway through the year to just kind of
update everybody to see where we are and
how we're doing and I feel like I really
could wear this through the summer I
could wear it through the winter so I
think that that is going to be something
I'm really going to try and use up the
next product is a moisturizing balm for
the lips this is something that I just
don't reach for often and I really
should because I think it's beautiful
and again it can be worn all year round
it is the l'oreal colour reach lip balm
in 218 Rose elixir and I'm just going to
keep this in my purse and see what
happens I have quite a bit of it left
and I really do think and hope that I
can get through this I i'm pretty sure i
can it's just a beautiful kind of rosy
pinky color the next product I want to
try and get through is like this little
quad from Milani this is the Milani
fierce foil I shines in 03 Florence a
lot of people don't like these i
actually do I think they look beautiful
as like an eye
or right on the lid I think they're
really gorgeous and there's no reason
that I shouldn't be using them
especially because they may dry out soon
so I really want to try and get to them
before that happens the next product is
a highlighter and this is actually a
palette of highlighters this is from ELF
this is the elf shimmer palette I used
to reach for this all the time like you
can see a hit pan on that one I used to
reach for this all the time and I just
don't anymore this one is called shear
sunrise and I think it's beautiful it's
got a beautiful beautiful um finish to
it all of them are really really nice
and creamy and beautiful on the skin and
they go over powder really really easily
so there's no reason I shouldn't be able
to finish that up and I really am trying
to look into using more of my cream
products just in general i tend to reach
for powder products because those are my
favorite um but i have a lot of cream
products and I feel like you know I
really should try and use those more
because they are gorgeous another lip
product I want to try and use up is the
Revlon just bitten kissable balm stain
this is in 001 honey this is the product
again I used to use all the time you
guys will be able to see um but there's
not too much left in here actually there
kind of is but again this is a beautiful
neutral color that I think critique me
throughout the whole year without it
being like oh I'm wearing bright red
lips in the middle of summer so um I am
excited to try and use that up it has a
really nice kind of minty scent to it
it's really really wonderful product
that I basically just forgot about
another lip product is the NYX butter
gloss this is in tiramisu a gorgeous
gorgeous neutral kind of pink color no
reason why I shouldn't be able to use
this up it goes with absolutely
everything so definitely including that
two eyeshadows single eyeshadows that I
want to include are my color pop
eyeshadows well they're just two of them
these are two that I think it could go
on my lid with basically any sort of
eyeshadow look that I put together the
two sheets are bubbly which is a
beautiful pink color I just don't reach
for these often and honestly color pub I
shadows are easy to get through so I
shouldn't have an issue with this so
bubbly and also get lucky which is
beautiful gold color and I just thought
that these really could go with any
eyeshadow look and I could just tap them
on my lid or use them as a liner shade
and yeah the next product I want to try
and get through i loved this when i did
a review for this i think it was this
past spring or maybe summer this is the
Stila aqua Cola watercolor blush in
water lilies is a beautiful product it's
absolutely stunning the color is
beautiful the formulation everything is
gorgeous so I don't know why I don't
reach for this more often it kind of has
a little mesh thing at the bottom and
then the color comes out but when you
blend it you'll see in a minute it just
blends like into the skin beautifully
it's like watercolor like literally it's
just it's it just leaves a gorgeous
gorgeous stain and I remember it going
over my powder foundations or even just
um you know anything that like my phone
I powder my face a lot is what I'm
trying to say I remember this blush
gliding over and not having any issues
whatsoever um with you know sometimes
you can put like cream products on and
then you see that your makeup is
starting to come off underneath I did
not have that issue with this so I'm
really excited to try and use that up I
have two eyeliners here that are in
similar kind of shade range they're
basically kind of like a grungy gray
brown color with a little bit of green
and gold shimmer and I think they're
gorgeous and I don't know why I don't
use them more often the first one is
from pixie it is the endless silky I pen
in sage gold and I just need to sharpen
this one it's kind of at its last bubble
nub but um I want to get through that
whole thing and that is a swatch of what
it looks like really gorgeous color and
there's no reason why I know I keep
saying there's no reason why but really
there's no reason why I should be able
to get through this because really this
could go with anything and then this one
is the Stila smudge stick waterproof
eyeliner in starfish so there's starfish
and then that one is um what is it
called sage gold so really really
beautiful i think that those would look
gorgeous just right on the water line or
i don't know i mean i could do a lot of
things with this so I'm excited to try
and get through those I've
single eyeshadow here that I used to use
all the time from Maybelline it is the
chic naturals in what 15 asks linen and
i just used to put this all over my I
you guys can see right before i would
put any sort of transition color on or
any other eyeshadows i would take this
from my lid all the way up to my brow
bone and it has a little bit of a
shimmer you guys can see i have hit pan
and I just thought you know what I
should get back into using this and I
think I can definitely use it that up
another little product that I want to
use up that I feel like it's kind of
well both of these are kind of like
priming products I just don't reach for
this because it's the equivalent of just
wearing a moisturizer underneath your
eyes but because i have it i might as
well use it this is the Smashbox photo
finish hydrating under eye primer it has
kind of a pink tinge to it and it really
does brighten up the under eye area but
again i feel like all it does is just
moisturize like an eye cream would so I
could use it instead of an eye cream in
the morning or if I'm really really dry
I could use it on top of my eye cream
and then also this bare mineral bare
minerals well rested face and eye
brightener this is in the shade clear
and it's just one of those little twist
up kind of products and you have like
this kind of it's not really clear as
more of like a yellowy kind of
consistency but when you blend it in
other under the eyes or on the face it's
not necessarily a illuminator but it's
just kind of one of those like priming
products I feel like I could get through
this and I really never reach for it so
I would like to get through it and then
the last product I want to talk about is
actually a three-step kit this is from
dr. jart and again when i reviewed this
product i really liked it and then I
just never reached for it again it got
you know lost in my collection basically
but it is the dr jart be teammate
contouring one two three kids it comes
in this adorable little packaging you
open it up and you have basically a
cream highlight a cream corrector and
then a cream contouring thing and I have
a lot of these kind of products and I
don't reach her them because again I
prefer my product my powder products I
think that these are really really
wonderful this is the highlight shade
and have SPF 30 in it
this is the correcting or neutralizing
shade also has SPF 30 in it and then you
get this nice kind of contouring cream
color and it comes out like that and I
just have not really reached for it but
it Clyde's on super creamy and I feel
like I could blend that with my Beauty
Blender and kind of contour my face
maybe even before putting on foundation
so that it looks really seamless and
pretty so anyway those are all the
products that I would like to use up for
this collaboration / tag video um like I
said I would like for all of you to
absolutely do this tag video if you
would like to and thank you again l for
including me in this and I guess I'll
see you guys halfway through the year to
give you um you know I'll check in with
you guys about how I'm doing with all
these products I'll say the one I'm the
most nervous about is probably the blush
because I feel like powder blushes are
really hard to get through but I'm gonna
try so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video thank you so much for joining me
and I'll see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
