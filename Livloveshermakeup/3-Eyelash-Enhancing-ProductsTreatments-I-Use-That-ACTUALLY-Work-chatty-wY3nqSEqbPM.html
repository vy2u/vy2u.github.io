so excited for today's video because I
am talking with you guys about three
eyelash enhancing products that actually
work I am not affiliated or sponsored or
I wasn't sent any of these products the
ones that I am going to mention I
literally have been trying these out for
more than five years now let's see here
the aligned lash serum I have been
purchasing since I was 18 years old I
have been purchasing um sorry that was
rapid lash this would lie laughs I've
been purchasing this since I was 18
years old it's the first one I ever
tried rapid lash I have been purchasing
for two years now and then the cargo
lash activator night I have been using
for a year so these are the top 3 lash
stimulating products that I have tried I
don't want to say I've tried I have
tried a lot these are the ones that
actually work I want to say really
quickly a lot of people always ask me oh
what you know you're so lucky you have
naturally long eyelashes or or what
mascara are you wearing when you use
like lash enhancing products that
actually work any mascara will make your
lashes look amazing today I have on the
MT J which is just like I think like a
no-name sort of mascara with a Lancome
Hypnose drama on top and I just have one
layer of each and I think my lashes look
really really nice I just want to say
you know yeah my lashes are naturally
not like this I first started looking
into lash enhancing treatments and I was
thinking about doing eyelash extensions
when I was 18 because I really wanted
long pretty lashes and I don't know how
to use like false eyelashes I still am
really bad at it
and I'm maybe will attempt it one day
because I do have quite a few but for
the most part I don't feel like I really
need them any more now but um back in
the day I really just had pretty short
lashes that stuck out pretty much
completely straight and they never had a
nice curl they weren't super long
especially my lower lashes they always
wanted really really long lower lashes I
always thought that made the eyes look
so big and open and pretty so I
basically went on the hunt for the best
eyelash enhancing product I spent more
than $150 on a lot of them and then it
turns out that the top three two of them
are under $50 the ones that I have tried
and then my favorite one which is lie
lash is quite expensive so I just want
to throw out the prices to you guys
really quickly the cargo lash
accelerator and
night a version that I use is $25 you
can get that on Nordstrom you also can
get that on the ulta.com website I'm
going to link that below where you guys
can get it I would say out of all of
these this is my second favorite my
first favorite is the priciest one it is
ligh lash and this was taken off the
market in the USA for a while I don't
know what happened and I started
ordering it from eBay and I got just bad
stuff it was not the real stuff I was
getting a fake basically eyelash serum
because this worked wonders this is what
sparked me to start using eyelash serums
because it actually worked it has the
same ingredient as I believe what is
that called Latisse and I asked my
doctor I remember when I was 18 I was
like can you put me on Latisse and she
was like why and I was like because I
want long eyelashes and she was like
yeah that's more for like people that
like you know are aging and want to grow
their eyelashes or they lost their
eyelashes so I feel guilty even asking
for a prescription and also she was the
one who actually recommended she spent
looking to the over-the-counter ones and
I said why she said they're the same
formula they're their same thing and I
was like but why can't you just give me
the prescription she was like you don't
need it and I was like I do though I
felt like I did I just always had very
very average lashes so anyway this was
the first one I ever tried like I said
it is a lie lash and this is a hundred
and forty seven dollar lie lash eyelash
treatment it's very expensive you have
to order from the eyelash website like I
said it was taken off of like at the
market like the USA like a United States
market for about a year and I was so
upset that's when I started going and
looking for other products and that's
when I ran into the other two which I
really really do love but this is my
all-time favorite
it sucks that's so expensive but it is
the one that works the best it works the
best at lengthening and what you do is
you basically just paint it onto your
lash line so this is what it looks like
I want to say right away these can cause
irritation redness dark spots on your
eyelid area when I first started using
this I got little tiny brown spots on my
eyelid area I never really cared because
honestly I cover that with makeup anyway
but if you're someone who doesn't wear a
lot of foundation or like eye primer you
might not want to try this one you would
probably want to try
the cargo one because that is like a
mascara sort of treatment so anyways the
two different kinds of treatments that
they basically sell on the market are
the ones that are like the wand that you
actually put on to your lashes and the
ones that you paint on to your lash line
I find these ones that you paint onto
your lashline give you the most length
of this Lyle ash I basically just take
it I put it on my upper lashes they
recommend not putting it on your lower
lashes but this is the reason my lower
lashes are nice and long now they were
always very very short and I always
wanted long lower lashes for whatever
reason so I just paint it uh at night so
I'll put it underneath my lower lash
line and on top of my upper lash line
and you only need the smallest amount I
would say one tube of this lasts me
about six to seven months and sometimes
if I don't want to repurchase it I will
go and I will use the other products so
you can't get a demi size of this like I
said I'm going to link the direct
website below do not order from any
warehouse anywhere else that's cheaper
or whatever it is not the same thing I
promise you it's not the same thing I
tried everything it's not the same
formula so you have to order from the
eyelash website I don't have any like
referral or link code or anything like
that I'm not affiliated I'm just going
to link it below so you guys can go
directly to that website and you can get
like a demi bottle for I believe 115
which is like half the size of this I
would recommend just getting the full
size for like 150 I know it's a lot but
if you want length that one is what
completely changed my lashes and the
nice thing about the light lash is that
I don't have to continuously use it
continuously use it I find that if I use
it once a week I'm good I don't lose any
length I don't lose eyelashes and I
really really like that because then you
can use the tube for longer like this
one I think I've had this for six months
it'll probably last me a year if I just
touch up once a week so you want to use
it every single day they recommend not
going on the lower lash line you can if
you want to like I said I do get redness
around the eye area no matter what still
when I use this after like five years of
use but I don't mind because I do wear
foundation and concealer and things like
that it did get better over time the
little brown spots that were left there
did end up fading over time but you have
to remember what's in here is the same
formula as the Latisse and if you've
ever seen the Latisse commercials
they're always like brown spots and
whatever blindness may occur
I've never had any sort of issue with
like blurry vision or anything like that
I mean definitely don't put it in your
eye just be really really careful when
you're putting it on your lower lash
line so anyway this is the best one for
length in my opinion and I like that I
only have to use it once a week now when
I first wanted to build up length really
really quickly I used this every single
day I would say it took about two months
for me to get these kind of lashes and I
feel like they're nice and long and sick
now this doesn't necessarily like help
with like the health of your lashes or
the thickness of your lashes but it does
help with length so my lash is my
all-time favorite
decided what I want to talk about is my
second favorite this is such a good deal
is my third one I don't even know what
happened to the little top part this is
the cargo lash activator night treatment
serum whatever this is one that you
literally just put onto your lashes like
a mascara wand and I like that because
you're not going to be irritating your
eyes so you literally just put it on
it's a clear treatment you can wear it
during the day I never wear the ligh
lash during the day because it does make
my eyes sensitive and kind of water I
recommend just using these at night but
you can actually use this during the day
I believe they have a day version as
well I swear to you I get links from the
light lash but if you want thickness and
you want your lashes to be healthy and
not fall out the cargo lash activator
night is amazing if this is the one that
I've used in between maybe like I'll use
the eyelash once a week like I said I
don't love to purchase it because it's
so expensive and then if I really want
my lashes to be in good shape I will use
this like every single night it is
amazing and for twenty-five dollars you
cannot beat it you can get it on the
Nordstrom website and also the Ulta calm
website I will link it below if you are
going to pick up one of these to start
and try I would pick this one up see
what it can do for you for length you'll
be surprised at how much thicker your
lashes look and how much healthier they
are they don't really fall out when
you're taking off waterproof like eye
makeup or anything like that and I just
noticed that this did help a little bit
with length but not too much because I
feel like the my lash was the one that
really stimulated like my eyelashes a
lot as far as growth goes and then they
couldn't get really like any longer if
that makes sense
so I would recommend trying this first
seen if it can give you length because I
do believe that it gives you a little
bit
I just can't get any longer than I am
now I kind of unlike at a like Plateau
if that makes sense but anyway this is a
fantastic product like I said you just
put the wand on and right onto your
lashes and you just go like this and you
go to bed it's amazing it's really
really great it does kind of change your
lashes a dark color and it will make
them a little crispy so I personally
wouldn't wear it during the day but I
believe they do have a day version if
you want to try it out
amazing amazing all right and then the
last one the last one the last one I
want to talk about is the rapid lash
eyelash enhancing serum this is the
weakest out of the three that I'm
showing you um I think it's okay I think
it's pretty darn good I would definitely
recommend the cargo one first because
this one is again one of those things
that you paint onto your lash line it
can cause irritation redness dark spots
things like that so if you don't want
that try the cargo one I think that this
is nice in between like if I am running
low on the cargo and I'm running low on
the ligh lash I will grab this it's good
enough I think that it really really
helps to condition the lashes I don't
really notice a huge amount of new
growth or anything like that because I
feel like I really am all grown out like
I can't get any longer than this but it
does help a little bit with thickness
this is a little more pricey than the
cargo and I believe it's 49.95 on the
ulta.com website it will link below it's
just okay a lot of people talk about it
I don't like the little one as much it's
a little spicier than the eyelash I just
feel like it is not as great but it
still works so if you are looking at one
that you want to put on your actual lash
line to see a lot of growth then you
could try the rapid lash before they'll
eyelash but I think my lash would work
better in the long run and I do feel
like even though you get the same I
believe you get the same amount of
product in here I feel like I really
have to like pump the wand for this
rapid lash could get product out which
is kind of annoying and like I said it
clumps up on the wand I don't love it
but I did want to mention it because I
do think it works so those are the three
that I wanted to talk about I want to
say it really really quickly I have also
tried rapid brow this is also from the
what is it like rapid lash line I also
this from ulta I like this a lot better
than the eyelash stimulating product so
also if you have like patchiness in your
eyebrows or things like that when I go
into a lupus flare up I sometimes lose
like a lot of my eyebrows this actually
works very very well so if you are
looking for a good eyebrow treatment I
just wanted to throw that in there it
literally is like a spoolie wand and you
just put it over your eyebrows at
nighttime or during the day and I really
do think it helps over time to kind of
bring the hair back in if that makes
sense and kind of cover up patchiness
I'm not wearing any brow products today
last week I literally had a whole chunk
missing like on the side of my eyebrow
and now it's all filled in so excuse me
so I think it is really really good and
I'm talking too much now I'm just like
starting to I'm getting super super
excited about it because I love talking
about these products I get really
excited because so many people are like
you're such great eyelashes and I'm like
you can have them too so anyway I hope
that I haven't been talking for too long
I think my throat is closing up and
telling me I have been but I just wanted
to tell you guys about those three
eyelash enhancing products that actually
work if I would say like the first one
you should try if you are new to the
game is go get the cargo one if you
don't see results get the lai lash and
if you want you can get the rapid lash
they all work but they're different ly
lash helps with length and cargo helps
with thickness and a little bit of
length and also just like overall health
of your lashes I want to touch on
something really quickly because I have
tried literally everything under the Sun
for my lashes um oils put in castor oil
putting avocado oil coconut oil on your
lashes does it help them grow no not in
my experience
it does condition them but you have to
be careful sometimes your eyelashes are
very very fragile especially if you wear
a lot of mascara on them a lot of
waterproof mascara they get weighed down
they get heavy like mine are so when you
put oil on them first of all just be
really careful because a lot of the time
I ended up getting it into my actual
eyeball and that causes like blurriness
it's a really scary but anyway I think
it does condition the lashes which is
nice it's nice to have healthy lashes
but I don't personally think that castor
oil or avocado oil or coconut oil help
to make your lashes grow and if you
already have fragile eyelashes which a
lot of people do they can break off if
you put too much heavy product on there
and
are very heavy especially coconut and
avocado very very heavy oil so just be
aware of that be careful and yeah one
thing I wanted to touch on as well any
time I use the cargo one I do take the
wand and I hit the backs of my lashes as
well just to make sure everything is all
coated and yeah so anyway I hope you
guys enjoyed this video like I said I
never really had these eyelashes I have
never had eyelash extensions or anything
like that
I looked into every single thing that I
could possibly do and I tried some of
them I've been playing with these for
years and years and years now they are
my tried and true I have tried
everything on the market everything and
these are the best ones in my opinion so
I do hope you guys enjoyed this video if
you want any other information just
leave me a comment down below if I
missed anything and I'll see you guys in
tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
