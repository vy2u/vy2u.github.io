thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a fantastic day this
video is going to be the announcement or
yeah basically the announcement of the
winner for my three thousand subscriber
giveaway i posted a video about a week
ago and i am giving away a blush palette
a lip kit and also an eyeshadow palette
and it was because i hit 3000
subscribers and i just wanted to let you
guys know right away just want to say
really quickly thank you to everyone who
entered i read every single comments
although i was not able to respond to
all of them I read every single comment
I got a lot of new recipe ideas for
christmas and for the holidays things
like that i need to learn how to make
tamales and also grasshopper pie you
know you get a lot of you said sweet
potatoes with marshmallows on top and
like these are all fantastic I can't
wait to make these recipes so thank you
so much for kind of inspiring me with
your comments on the video so I just
want to say thank you so much to
everybody who entered I really really
appreciate it and before I announce the
winner I am gonna get all heartfelt and
have a little moment here with you guys
I just want to say thank you so much my
um subscriber count and my channel has
kind of had a growth spurt within the
past month and a half to two months I've
been gaining about 200 to 300
subscribers a week which is like
incredible to me because there was a
time where I was kind of at a standstill
between a thousand or like 1500
subscribers and I don't really know what
has happened but all I know is that you
guys have been sharing and liking and
commenting on my videos and you've been
very very active and I really appreciate
that because I think that kind of gets
the word out about your channel and
things like that and I just want to say
thank you so much to everybody who does
that especially when you guys share my
videos I think that's one of the biggest
things I've noticed that somebody has
been sharing almost every single one of
the videos that i posted lately and that
is huge to me and I've been gaining so
many subscribers so I just want to say
thank you so much to my subscribers
whether your old whether you're new
thank you so much I really do appreciate
and love every single one of you so
anyway without further ado the winner of
the 3000 subscriber giveaway is Alicia
Clevenger and I believe she has been a

responding to it about maybe two or
three weeks ago um she had said I'm a
