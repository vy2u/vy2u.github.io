today I am walking you guys through four
different high-end expensive skin care
products that in my opinion are not
worth the money so let's go ahead and
start with the Omo WTO this is the queen
of Hungary mess now ninety dollars is
what you will pay if you want to pick up
a full-size of this this little guy
right here is a trial size for one fluid
ounce and for one fluid ounce a product
you can purchase this for $30 now keep
in mind a full-size is 3.4 ounces a
product but that is the normal amount
that you will find any other setting
spray or a facial toning mist that will
go anywhere between twenty to thirty
dollars on the sephora.com website even
these yearly gross water balancing this
is three point six fluid ounces of
product and that retails for thirty five
dollars which I always thought was
pretty expensive for a facial mist now
they say this is good for normal oily
combination dry and sensitive skin and
it is a refreshing neroli and rose
scented toning facial mist perfect for a
midday pick-me-up or a post cleanse
toner it says it is a solution for
dryness as well as dullness and honestly
I noticed nothing when I use this
particular product now I feel like if
you're going to shell out ninety dollars
for an expensive skin care product like
this you should notice something that's
a little interesting or something's
going on with your skin whether it be
it's putting more moisture into the skin
or whether it be that it's helping with
brightness or dullness or anything like
that I really feel like it should be
doing something and you can literally go
to Whole Foods and pick up a beautiful
rose water and glycerin sort of facial
mists for fifteen dollars so this is the
first product that is definitely not
worth it in my opinion I do love the
sprayer it comes out very evenly and
nicely so when I am done with this
probably gonna give it to my boyfriend
to use up I will go ahead and keep the
bottle but that's pretty much it
definitely would not recommend moving on
to these Sunday Riley ceramics lip clay
cleanser it says the deep cleans
invisibly shrinks pores for clearer
healthy-looking skin it is for normal to
oily skin it is completely empty thanks
to my boyfriend I actually purchased in
this particular cleanser for $45 on the
Sephora comm website back when I lived
in Milwaukee and I was on my lupus trial
I had drugs that were making my skin a
little more oily a lot of sebum being
produced and I honestly
I had this on my wish list for a very
long time I really really wanted to try
it out now initially I thought this was
doing great things for me a really
really helped to keep in my t-zone in
check throughout the day if you have
incredibly incredibly oily skin I could
see you liking this but over time even
with my combo skin I noticed that this
started to dry my skin out insanely I
mean to the point where I was starting
to get breakouts because there was no
oil left on my skin so like I said if
you are incredibly incredibly oily I
could see you liking this but for $45 I
mean something that's gonna sit on your
skin for maybe 1 to 2 minutes tops
it's just absolutely not worth it now
you may be thinking but Olivia you
talked about the drug elephant best
e-jelly cleanser which retails for
around 38 maybe possibly $40 as well how
can you say that this product is not
worth it but that one is that one I
actually see a difference with and to be
completely honest that particular guy I
used for double cleansing but I do leave
on my skin for 3 to 4 minutes I cannot
do that with this because it starts to
sting around my eye area it starts to
really really feel abrasive on my skin
and honestly this just really made my
skin feel raw chapped and dehydrated so
in my opinion these Sunday Riley ceramic
slip clay cleanser is not good if you
have normal skin if you have a combo
skin it's really not good either I know
that they say for normal to oily skin
here but I would only recommend if you
are super super super oily up next we
have the Peter Thomas Roth unwrinkle
turbo face serum this was another
product that initially I thought I kind
of liked but then I realized it really
didn't do for my skin it a full
sides of this will set you back a
hundred and fifty dollars and honestly
I'm pretty surprised that this has a
four star rating on these sephora.com
website I have learned to not really
trust so far a dot-com greeted things
because I feel like Sephora always takes
out my reviews personally if I give a
negative review they're really weird
about like their 2 star &amp;amp; 1 star rated
reviews but yeah this has a four star
rating it says that it will target these
six most stubborn deeper wrinkles and
facial expression lines on your face and
that's a turbocharged blend at 18 potent
anti-aging neuro peptides and peptides
at 72% with hyaluronic acid and vitamins
A C and E those are a lot of claims for
a serum like this and
after using it consistently I didn't
notice the difference I believe it does
have some retinol in here as well and I
didn't like the way my skin reacted with
this particular product now if you do
check out the unwrinkle line
unfortunately Peter Thomas Roth is not a
cruelty-free brand but I do get a lot of
people asking about Peter Thomas Ross so
if you're not cruelty free the one thing
I would recommend from the unwrinkle
line are the under wrinkle cleansing app
ads I enjoyed those a lot but you know
the cleansing lotion as well as this I
just don't feel like they're worth the
money they irritated my skin they made
them incredibly dry incredibly patchy
and just very very flaky and I'm one of
those people I know that you have to
consistently use a retinoid is sort a
product over and over again before your
skin is going to get used to it but this
never did anything for my skin I feel
like I notice a bigger difference when I
use something like the pixie glow tonic
so definitely not worth the one hundred
and fifty dollar price tag finally we do
have these Sunday brightly Bluemoon
tranquility cleansing a balm this will
set you back $50 on the sephora.com
website I know a lot of people who love
this product I enjoy a lot of products
from Sunday Riley but this and the
ceramics looks like cleanser in my
opinion are almost kind of gimmicky like
for the price are you for real right now
I know they use very very good
ingredients but you could get something
that is literally identical to this for
the fraction of the price I love at the
pharmacy green clean echinacea cleansing
balm for $32 the bye bye and makeup from
it cosmetics for $38 is supposed to be
very very similar as well you get the
same the sort of amount of product in
here and one big con when it comes to
this for my dry skin is that this
actually has cleansing beads in it now
obviously when you're using some sort of
a cleansing balm like this at the clot
process usually is that you're going to
go in and double cleanse to make sure
you get off all your residual makeup so
you're using something that actually
have exfoliating beads in it it's very
rough around the lip area it's very
rough around the eye area and then on
top of that you're going in with a
double cleanse well that's why if you
have incredibly dry skin like I do
unfortunately that is just going to
strip your skin more I don't need that
exfoliation every single night with this
I already use products at night like
retinoids and retinols and all sorts of
different glycolic acids and things like
that that are going to exfoliate my skin
I don't want to over exfoliate because
that's not good
for my dry skin to be completely honest
so this is just not something that I
think is worth the money like I said you
can get so many other cleansing bombs or
cleansing oils for a fraction of the
price that are much better than this so
unfortunately this did not work for me I
did use it up completely I'm happy I did
I got my money's worth but I yeah would
not repurchase in any way shape or form
so that is it guys those are for
expensive skin care products that in my
opinion are not worth the money please
let me know if you would try these down
below if you like them if you don't like
them and I guess I will see you guys in
my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
