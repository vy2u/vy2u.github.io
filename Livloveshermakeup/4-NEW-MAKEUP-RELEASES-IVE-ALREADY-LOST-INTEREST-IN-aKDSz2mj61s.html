back to my channel thank you so much for
joining me you might be wondering oh
where the fuck are you live and why are
you sitting in such a dark environment
okay I am currently in Hawaii you guys
and today at my boyfriend actually has a
conference so I thought I would go ahead
and foamy video and then I'm gonna go
down to the pool and edit it while
drinking some sort of fucking martini or
some fucking alcoholic beverage okay so
today I wanted to walk you guys through
some new what makeup releases I have
recently lost interest in aka pictures
that I saw of these products before they
were actually opened up and now we don't
want to buy them because I'm not
interested in what's on the inside I
know this sounds really really weird and
usually I'm that kind of person where if
I show something in like will I buy a
video and I say I'm gonna buy it you
know I'm gonna buy it I'm just one of
those people or I'm like if I'm drawn to
it and I really really wanted I'm going
to get it and most likely you will see a
review on my channel but there have been
four new makeup releases I have shown a
lot of interest in and suddenly I saw
the inside of the actual palette or the
trio's and I'm really not interested
anymore I think the problem is is that
my imagination is just too fucking big
and these brands go ahead and they
release of these shots like two months
ahead of time right of these pallets on
the outside and we don't get to see
what's on the inside
I think my imagination is way too
fucking good and better than these
makeup companies and I started thinking
it's gonna be something fucking
fantastic with unicorns and rainbows
shooting out of it and then I see the
inside and I'm like what is they what is
that okay so that is basically what has
happened and will not be purchasing you
know these products I'm gonna let you
guys know why so I guess it's kind of
like a little bit of an anti haul let's
go ahead and jump right into it shall we
alright guys so I want to start - with
the new Abeka light waves highlighter
palette and this is new it is a limited
edition it says it is a mesmerizing trio
of iconic highlighter formulas including
the brand-new exclusive shade called the
pink sapphire alongside two of the
best-selling moonstone and prismatic
amethyst highlighters this does retail
for $34 which is a pretty darn good deal
if you don't want to pick up this 50 for
a dollar Becca a place Kiko face palette
but I have to say I saw the outer
packaging of
I immediately posted on Instagram I'm
getting it I'm getting it I'm just
thinking you're just stupid Liz are you
saying you're gonna buy something if you
haven't seen the inside yet I have two
of these in full sight I have moonstone
many times over in my collection and I
looked at the inside of the palette and
I have to say I was completely
underwhelmed so now I feel really bad
that I posted it oh my god you have
Instagram and I'm like oh yeah I'm gonna
get oh I'm gonna get it I'm not gonna
get it I don't need that in my life I'm
very happy that I picked up my one
backup aldehyde to get during the
holiday season but that is not a palette
that I need now I will say that pinks
after she does look very very beautiful
it kind of has some peachy tones to it
not so much like pink tones to it in my
opinion but I think that would be a
gorgeous gorgeous blush topper if you do
have a later complexion if you've been
wanting to try out prismatic amethyst
which is a gorgeous gorgeous opalescent
white kind of color with a purple shift
as well as moonstone this is going to be
a great palette for those of you with
more of a fear to light complexion even
if you do have a medium or deep
complexion I feel like people are going
to enjoy this so again if you don't want
to get the $54 palette I think this is a
great deal but for me I don't need it it
was just stupid that I was so into it
before I even see what was on the inside
and then they opened it up and I was
pretty damn disappointed so that is the
first valid that I will not be picking
up even though initially I had shown
some interest in all right guys up next
we have these storybook cosmetics me
girls burn book collaboration I don't
even know it's not really a
collaboration I feel like storybook
cosmetics isn't known for doing
collaborations when they're really not
collaborations you know what I'm saying
all right anyway this is a 55 dollar
palette I grew up in the time of Mean
Girls if that makes sense
I was either in middle school or I was
in early a high school when the movie
came out and I fucking loved it this was
a great movie okay
just the references and everything in
there I'm super super excited for this
palette especially when they showed the
outside of the actual burn book palette
it looks like tentacle to a via movie
like the third book in the movie and I
really wanted this for sentimental value
then I saw the inside and I was like
hell no it's not even about wearing
those colors it's just about the fact
that if it's going to be Mean Girls you
should have those kind of Mean Girls
colors in there there needs to be more
Pink's there needs to be more purples
forget that fucking green shade forget
those mustardy tones now that this
reminds me of me girl so I was super
disappointed when I saw the inside of
this there's no way in hell I'm gonna
purchase that for $55 oh and no thank
you sorry about that story about
cosmetics all right up next we do have
the new Tarte spark app princess chisel
palette now initially this really did
catch my attention I actually posted a
picture on Instagram and I asked you
guys what do you think of this the outer
packaging looks fucking amazing it's
kind of like this snake print but then
you got par cap princess against it and
kind of like that metallic gold that's
kind of raised so it feels like I can
feel like the packaging in my hands I
feel like it's gonna be nice and secure
and beautiful but then I was really
looking at the inside and I'm like what
do I need for fucking contour shades
like that for I love the fact that those
parts were shades go very very deep I am
all for brands opening up their shade
selection and introducing shades that
will work for everyone but I have to say
what am I gonna use this unless I'm a
goddamn makeup artist which I am NOT
okay when would you actually get that
much use out of this I just can't
imagine anybody picking this up unless
you are head over heels in love with
contouring or if you are a makeup artist
so for me I just find this a little
strange the inside of the palette I love
the outer packaging I love the overall
concept of it I love that they have
shapes that go super super deep in here
but this is not something I'm gonna pick
up it initially really starts my
intention but it's not something I'm
gonna get anymore because you know what
I'm not gonna get any fucking use out of
it okay alright and finally guys we have
the metal crush
talent from Kat Von D now I'm sure you
didn't fucking see the shit coming
because I did not see this shit coming
and this was something unusually I was
incredibly excited about I did kind of
like hey will I buy it's lurch or purge
video and I was like okay oh yea splorch
splorch all the way i had not seen the
inside yet but it was just you know they
released the photo months in advance and
I hate when brands do that because like
I said I feel like maybe my imagination
is a little better than what's gonna
come out on the inside they opened it up
and I thought what was on the inside and
I was like I have all that I have all
that and it's very important for me to
find products that I already don't kind
of have in my collection you know what I
mean I can literally do shit out all day
in my collection a lot of us can you
hear on YouTube we have a large
collection but there was something about
this palette that I just thought was
gonna be a little more wham bam in your
face you note again I thought it was
gonna be a little more colorful and I
just thought it maybe was gonna happen
before or 5hi later I don't know why I
just thought the pan sizes will be
smaller I thought there was gonna be
more to offer and on top of that the
swatches man the swatches really don't
look that pigmented they don't look that
exciting they look like they may have a
little bit of glitter infused in there I
don't want to take the chance I don't
want to take the chance I don't think
this is gonna be a highlighting palette
that I'm going to enjoy it I really like
that they did that kind of purplish
shade in there I think that's beautiful
but the other two shape I'm just like
idea that you know and I was just
holding the cap on Dee because she is so
different and she's very artistic I was
hoping she was going to release
something that's a little different you
know what I mean I know colorful
highlights are so fucking in right now
and I'm all aboard that train okay
all aboard and the color ball
highlighter train I'm on it but I have
to say this was just something that was
kind of I don't even know I just was a
little dismissive of it when I saw the
inside cuz I was kind of like oh that's
not really what I was expecting which
again it's one of those things where
those brands are literally showing
pictures of the outer packaging and we
start thinking oh my god here's what its
gonna look like on the inside and then
it doesn't look like that autumn really
will suck okay so yeah those are some
products recently and that I thought I
really wanted to pick up but then I saw
the inside or the actual product itself
and I decided you know what I'm not
gonna pick that up please let me know
down below what you guys thought of
these products are you going to pick
them up
I'm sure if you still get them they're
gonna be great quality but it's just so
hard because our imaginations just keep
going on and on you know
they released these pictures months in
advance and we're like oh this is what's
gonna be on the inside and then that's
not what we expected I wish brands would
just show us right away okay here's the
picture of the goddamn pallet here's the
outside here's the inside you can expect
this in 20 fucking 20 okay
that's what I want to see so anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for joining me I'm gonna
head down to the beach now have a little
bit of alcohol a beverage and I guess I
will see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
