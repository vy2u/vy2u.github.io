you so much for joining me happy
Wednesday I'm really sorry if my voice
sounds a little different today I'm
still getting over my pneumonia and I
feel like it sounds lower or something
anyway
today we're going to do a really quick
little lip palate showdown or battle
video between the new Anasazi of Beverly
Hills lip Ellis and also the Urban Decay
vice junkie lipstick palette now I
originally was going to do the black
nail the junkie and this one but I just
thought when I put all three out in
front of me and really looked at the
color selection these were going to be
the two that we're going to compete
against each other because honestly the
black male is completely different is
very neutral it's very natural and to be
completely honest I am very much bias
against that one not biased against that
one I would pick that one out of all
three because I just like neutral and
natural makeup so we're going to do a
head-to-head a little competition
between these two little guys so let me
go ahead and give you some background
information the anasazi of beverly hills
lapel it does retail for $48 on the
Anastacio beverly hills calm website
this is permanent and this is volume 1
so that makes me think that they are
going to come out with a volume 2 or
multiple multiple different volumes you
are getting 18 different shades that are
completely matte and you can see you
have some beautiful shades a few pops of
colors here and then you actually have
primary colors down here for mixing
which is really really interesting and
you are getting a mixing plate included
I have no idea where my mixing plate
right I already lost it but you are also
getting a double-ended brush with a
spatula on one side so here is the
spatula side for mixing the product and
scooping it out and then here is the
breast side it's nothing significant but
it's nice to have alright and here is
the urban decay junkie vice' lipstick
palette this normally retails for I
believe around 39 dollars which is the
price that I bought it for it currently
is on sale for $20 on the Sephora Dom
website which is awesome you are getting
12 different shades ranging from more
neutral shades to more pops of colors
and you're actually getting a lot of
different finishes and cures you're
getting a glitter finish you are getting
a sheer finish some crunch finishes that
creme finishes and then also a math and
I believe to super matte so lots of
different finishes in here and it does
also include a double retractable with
brush I have no idea where mine is
again all right pan sizes let's talk
about that really quickly I do feel like
the anasazi a Beverly Hills looks like a
half
more products in it but actually they're
really really simpler so the Anasazi
Beverly Hills in each pan you are
getting a 0.03 ounces or 0.8 grams of
products and then in the urban decay you
are getting 0.02 ounces or 0.7 grams of
product per pan so they are actually
quite similar all right so let me tell
you guys which one I prefer I am
absolutely in love with this I am
falling in love with this more I use
this of more I love it it is really
really gorgeous the formulation is
amazing on this particular palette my
favorite is definitely the top row I
guess I hold it like this definitely the
top row as you guys can see you're
getting a lot of cool cone shades you're
getting some warm tone shades if you
love neutral lip colors you would love
that top row if you like pop the colors
you would like the middle and if you're
a makeup artist you're probably going to
love the bottom row because you can mix
and match any sort of color together to
create your own so I do you think it's
cool that they included the primary
colors in there I do get a little
worried about this packaging there is no
protective flat to go over the actual
product and these are already like on
that Center so they are a little more on
the drying side so that is something
that I am slightly worried about but for
the most part these are very creamy
extremely extremely long wearing you
guys the shades that I do have on today
is number 10 which is this one right
here and as you actually have it layered
with a glitter shade from at the junkie
palette so if you already have the
junkie palettes you need this one I
don't we don't think you need it but if
you do love having lift Alison you love
having variety and you really want to
create your own lip color I do think
that this would be something you would
like let me show you guys on the back
how would they actually label this so
they label this one two three four five
six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
and thirteen and then obviously primary
color one two three four and five so
they actually kind of dictated in like
rows they were saying Row 1 Row 2 Row 3
Row 4 Row 5
I'm not quite sure why they do that
maybe they're telling you hey if you
want to mix this color with this like
that would give you a certain color or
mix this one here or mix that one there
I don't do a ton of mixing I'm not a
makeup artist I'm just a girl who loves
makeup but I have been having a lot of
fun playing with this and I'm really
really impressed with the quality so
this is definitely my pick but we will
go ahead and talk about the junkie a
little bit because before I even got the
UH Nastasia Beverly Hills B junkie
palette and it is the box mail palette
where my all-time favorite lip palettes
I had so here is the packaging on the
urban decay of vices junkie you do open
it up and you do actually get a
protective flap which
you appreciate like I said I do think
when you have lit pallets the product
can tend to dry out a little bit even if
they aren't like a matte finish so you
do have this little protective flap that
you can actually clip on and off I took
it off for this video because it would
be hanging around in there but I really
do appreciate that they did that so I
also really adore the colors in here I
think they're beautiful you're getting
some nice neutrals down here with a few
pops of color you have a nice shade
right here which is called studded which
is like a true gray color which is very
interesting and this guy right here I
actually bought on christmas this is
called junkie which is a green sheet
with a bunch of glitter in it it doesn't
wear incredibly well it's kind of hard
to pull off a green lid but for the most
price this is a really really solid
palette as well and I feel like for 20
dollars you know if you really want to
get into lip palette this would be a
great one to check out so I really do
like the assortment of finishes as well
I am somebody who doesn't like anything
that's too drying on the lips
and although the anasazi of Beverly
Hills has an incredible incredible wear
time I do notice that these do dry out
my lips just a little bit now it's not
as bad as say a liquid lipstick I'm the
kind of girl that will like stay far
away from a liquid lipstick it's not
that bad but still it can be slightly
drying so definitely if you are someone
who lifts your lips a lot or if you're a
flutist or if your know somebody who has
dry lips go ahead and put on a lip balm
first so I would say if you really want
comfortable comfortable lip products I
would go with the junkie but for overall
wear and out such as color selection as
you can see annasophia is best so let me
show you guys some swatches really
quickly I want to start with this one
right here which is called sturb in the
junkie palette this is very similar to
the shade that I actually have on my
lips today that is from the Anasazi a
Beverly Hills palette so this is a creme
it finish as you guys can see full on
pigment I don't feel like either of
these palettes have an issue with
pigmentation they are way up is like
they are way up in there I spot that's
like the gradation is concerned so here
is number 10 again really really
beautiful they're very similar but you
guys will see when I do the side-by-side
swatch what I mean about de finishes so
here is the creme finish from the urban
decay and then here is the Anasazi
Beverly Hills this has almost like a
slight amount of skipping to it it just
doesn't apply completely evenly which
sometimes can be an issue but the
Anasazi of overlie Hills this goes on
beautifully I don't feel like it
one of those maths that's super super
uncomfortable have a little bit of a
sheen to it a little bit of a nice
feeling to the lips another say that I
do think is kind of similar is the shade
right here which is called carnival this
is from the Urban Decay palette this is
a really really beautiful kind of cool
tone your lips but better actually no
this is more now yeah it's a little more
cool tone but compared to the swaps I'm
going to show you guys next this is
Cardinal it is a creme and I just love
the way that looks it's a really
beautiful like 90s kind of color and
then this one right here which is called
number three from the anastacio palette
it also kind of similar but it
definitely has more of a warm undertone
and I just feel like the anasazi ones go
on so nicely they don't jump outside as
a lip line you definitely do have that
sometimes with like a creme formulation
or anything that's a little more sheer
but for the most part I really really
like the way that the Anastasio wants
kind of stick by the way if you were
curious about the deed little topper
that I put on top of it that shade at
number 10 it is this one right here
which is called Big Bang which is the co
litter shade and that was just an
italicized any sort of lip color that
you already have down and then now let
me go ahead and just swatch the junkie
shade for you guys from the Urban Decay
palette just for fun you can kind of see
the pop of color they are really really
beautiful I mean I love a green lip like
whoo I think that's so fun
now I know that the Anastacio palette
doesn't have a green color but it is a
lot of fun to play with you to be
careful with this one though because it
does start to go outside the lip line
and then just for fun I guess we'll go
ahead and swatch this yellow color which
obviously you would use these more to
mix with colors from the Anastacio but
that's okay so I have a bunch of
swatches of both palettes on either hand
but yeah pretty much a really really
nice I think both of them are often you
have to make the decision for yourself
on which kind of colors you prefer if
you want multiple multiple finishes if
you just want matte colors if you want
to make any sort of colors possible I
would go with the Anastacio but if you
want a good deal and you want multiple
finishes I think I'd go with the Urban
Decay so anyway I hope you guys enjoyed
this video let me know he was like
full-on swatches of the entire palette
on my Instagram I can definitely do that
and yeah I will see you guys tomorrow
