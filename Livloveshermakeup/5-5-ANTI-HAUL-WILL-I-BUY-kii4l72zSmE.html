channel today's video is going to be a 5
and 5 anti haul and will I buy now this
is going to be a collaboration with my
longtime YouTube friend at Meg Bernardo
if you guys have been watching my
channel for a while you probably know
that I have done probably well over 12
collaborations with Meg over the past
like a year and a half we used to do a
series every single month called sample
spotlight she ran out of samples
recently because she's kind of on a no
buy right now so we stopped doing that
series but I love Meg she does a lot of
different videos on her channel she has
a lot of different content so she will
post about you know using products up so
like project pan videos she also does a
makeup haul she also has a lot of videos
about fitness and lifestyle so if you
guys are interested in her channel I'll
go ahead and link her Instagram her
video and her channel down below in the
description bar and basically I reached
out to her and asked her she wanted to
do an antique haul and she said why
don't we talk about five products we
don't want to buy it and then five
products that we are interested in so
we're gonna call this 5 and 5 anti haul
and will i buy let me know if you like
the style of this video of course the
queen of the will i buy up series is my
friend here on youtube as well samantha
march so i'll go ahead and link her down
below if you would like to see the
original creator of that whole entire
series i'll link her playlist as well as
her channel but yeah let's go ahead and
jump right into it i want to start with
5 and different products that i am
definitely interested in so the first
one is from huda beauty you know i know
who to beauty has had a little bit of
controversy in the past i'm not quite
sure if i want to purchase from them or
not but I will say this particular
desert dust palette has really caught my
attention it does retail for $65 I
believe it will be released in September
and basically it says the inspiration
was reflecting on the mysterious desert
landscape desert at dusk it says it
includes 18 different shades 8 matte
shades 6 pressed pearls 3 o duochrome
toppers and one appear a glitter now I
never picked up the rose gold a palette
just because those colors in there
reminded me of a lot of other palettes
that I have in my collection I haven't
really been into those super super warm
tone palettes but I have to say and this
particular palette right here really
kind of makes my mouth of water I think
the colors look amazing I love those
purpley duochrome I love those really
topi colors I'm very very interested in
this so I would like to know what your
thoughts are down below did you like the
rose gold palette is there anything you
want me to know about who - Beauty I
know that they
a little bit of controversy about Minkel
ashes in the past which I'm totally not
okay with so I'm not quite sure if I
really want to purchase from them or not
but basically the controversy was the
fact that they were saying that they
have cruelty-free mink eyelashes if you
guys don't know minks are very wild
animals you cannot just sit and think
down and start combing it and taking out
its hair and put it on the lash band and
put it on your eye and that animal would
most likely be dead before you actually
take the hair so I don't really consider
that to be cruelty free I want to know
if you have more information on this if
you have heard this as well if you think
this is true but yeah that is definitely
a palette that has caught my attention
again I feel like there's a little bit
of controversy with hooda in general so
I'm not quite sure if I will buy it but
it has caught my attention all right
guys up next we do have the let's see
here cover FX perfect highlighting
palette this does include six different
highlighters with a newa formula for
extra glow it is a limited edition and
this will be a holiday 2017 item it
retails for $39 and the highlighters
that you get in here are blossom prism
rose gold golden peach celestial and
gilded so these are definitely
corresponding shades to the actual
custom enhancer drops that they have
this looks beautiful and I am probably a
hundred percent I would say 99.9% going
to buy this palette I think it looks
beautiful
I love highlighting palettes that look
like this it kind of reminds me on the
abh glow kits and I really love that
packaging I think that packaging is way
better than the Anasazi of Beverly Hills
glow kits so this is definitely
something I'm interested in I would love
to know if you guys are gonna pick this
up as well but yeah definitely expect a
review on that alright guys up next we
have the newest eonni London glitter of
lips these are liquid lipsticks with
glitters they have seven different
shades and basically what happens is you
put it on and then you rub your lips
together and glitter just like pops out
everywhere I don't know how the flippin
they did this okay I don't know how the
 they figured at this particular
formula out but it's so cool if you
actually watch it's the videos you can
see people and it's just like the more
you rub your lips together the more
glitter there is I think these look
really really cool and I'm honestly semi
tempted to buy one of these now I know
that I am NOT a huge liquid lipstick
kind of girl so that is currently what
is holding me back but this is
definitely something I'm interested in
if you have tried these out please let
me know down below and let me know what
she do you think I should get because
there's a lot of cool shades right here
alright guys up next we have the new
Anasazi of Beverly Hills a blush Kitt's
mm-hmm
you heard that right they're gonna be
coming out with blush hits it looks like
they also have a new glow kick coming
out as well as a little liquid lipsticks
at so I probably won't get the liquid
lipsticks that I don't like the
anastacio Beverly Hills liquid lipsticks
I did end up trying one out in a little
mini form and I did not think I was a
good formula at all I was cracking and
flaking off my lips all day hate it but
I will say that new bloke it I'm into it
I'm feeling it and then as far as the
other product is concerned it's just the
blush kits I feel like that's gonna be
amazing
I love the honest hacia Beverly Hills a
blush trio in peachy love I'm thinking
about getting more of those they're so
smooth the consistency is so beautiful
and anything that has to do with kit
glow kit blush kit freakin whatever kit
I will probably buy it from Anastacio
Beverly Hills so this is going to be a
for sure product that I'm going to be
purchasing alright guys and finally we
have the new smoky quartz a shimmering
skin Perfector press from Becca
cosmetics so I recently did pick up at
the lilac geode shimmering skin
Perfector press I've used it in a get
ready with Nia on Saturday I believe so
I'll go ahead and throw that video up in
the cards if you would like to check it
out I love it and smoky quartz
definitely looks very very beautiful I
don't know if this would be super
friendly for those of you who do have a
really really fair complexion I feel
like if you have more of a medium light
or deeper complexion this is gonna be
amazing though it seems like it has this
really really strong silver shift to it
but I'm pretty interested in it and I
definitely think I'm gonna pick this up
I love the shimmering skin perfecter
press you guys know lately I'm Becca has
been on my like hit list as far as like
really good brands are concerned I've
really been loving them they haven't
been on the list they've been on
the hit list so I'm very much interested
in this and I probably will end up
buying that as well alright guys now
let's go ahead and talk about five
different products that I will not be
buying the first one is definitely the
big blush book three of from Tarte
cosmetics so I do have the big blush
book to it from last year I rarely use
this I hate it I will be decluttering it
I know it looks amazing okay I know seen
all of this makes you think oh my god
for $60 you're getting all this stuff in
here but let me tell you this is not the
original Amazonian clay formula and I
know that because I have plenty of these
in full size this guy ray
here this Amazonian clay blush right
here which is called risque from the
Noddy new disguise are made in the US
and they are beautiful they don't have a
ton of kick up but they're not powdery
these guys right here this particular
palette was made in China I swear to God
the PALS that they make in China are
such a hit or miss and the reason why I
say a hit or miss is because I actually
did like last year's holiday palette
that looked like this this is called the
color wheel this one was out so made in
China I think the thing that bothers me
the most about Tarte palette eyeshadow
pellets as well as their blush palette
during the holiday season is that you
never know what you're gonna get and the
reason why I say that is because all
three of these have a different formula
this is my favorite this is my second
favorite formula and this
formula Hey okay I hate it's
just not good at all so I don't trust
the big blusher book 3 if you're
thinking that you get all this great
product in there and you're getting both
sides blushes and it's gonna be amazing
I highly doubt this is gonna be a good
palette so I would not recommend at the
big of blush book 3 it's not something I
want it's not something I need I would
recommend just getting at the full-size
blushes or if you want to take a little
bit of a risk you can go ahead and pick
up the holiday palette from this year I
hope it's similar to this formula like I
said this one right here is not the same
as the full sizes but it's pretty damn
close it's just such a hit or miss when
it comes to Tarte you guys I really
don't know what to say
proceed with caution that's that's what
I'm gonna leave it at proceed with
caution
all right guys up next we do have the
Lila palette so this is new from Natasha
- no no it does retail for $129 it is
permanent and I was getting so many tags
on this and I'm just gonna say it again
just like the sunset palette I will not
be purchasing this this is a ridiculous
price you guys yes the colors are
beautiful but I feel like the hooda
palette has the same sort of color
selection going on there as well as like
the drenched metals halides from a
violet sauce
so I personally don't feel like I need
it in my collection you guys I just
don't think it's worthy for a hundred
and twenty nine dollars you can
get two different palettes as before -
high-end beautiful palette sets before a
warm tone and a quill tone use those
together and get the same sort of thing
so this is not something I want to spend
my money on I would never judge you if
you want to go ahead and spend your
money on it you know if that's your
money you do whatever the hell you want
but from me this is not something I will
be purchasing I'm just not interested
although the color selection is very
pretty and something that we're not
seeing right now because
a little more cool tone with those pink
sand those purples I still feel like I
have colors like this in my collection
so I'm gonna be skipping all right guys
I'm moving on next up but we do have the
cover FX custom enhancer drops a vault
now this retails for 235 dollars you are
getting seven full sizes of the custom
enhancer drops so these are the liquid
version so you do get moonlight which is
a shimmering a beige you are getting
Celestia which is a glistening pearl you
are getting candlelight which is a
shimmering gold a bronzer you are
getting sunlight which is a soft and
glowing gold halo which is a holographic
and multi-dimensional blue kind of I
have I have a full-size kind of like a
blue purplish color it's really
beautiful
you get rose gold which is a warm and
pearlescent pink bronze and blossom
which is a soft and pearlescent pink if
this is a vegan its cruelty free listen
I really do like the custom enhancer
drops but I will say I'm more interested
in the tinier kit that they're going to
be releasing those are deluxe sizes and
you guys I would not recommend I don't
want to say wasting your money on this
but I would not recommend investing your
money on the full size vaults unless you
use these every single day to mix into
your foundation because a little go it's
such a long way what I would recommend
is getting the little tiny deluxe I set
I believe that's gonna go for around $40
it takes forever to get through these
suckers so I would not recommend that
you get the vault unless again you use
these every single day you can use them
as a liquid highlighter so you can kind
of apply them with a damp sponge I don't
feel like they disturb my foundation or
my powder too much which is fantastic
but I really like mixing in with
foundations I use the holographic shade
and I mix that into foundations a lot
but like I said a little goes a long way
all you need is one or two drops so I
don't think it's worth it for $235 to
buy the vaults I know a lot of all to
come out this time of year but I just
feel like it's a lot and like I mean I
don't think you would get through these
in time you know what I mean they're
gonna go back in your collection so if
you are interested in trying these out
highly recommend gained a little deluxe
sized kit that's also gonna be coming
out alright guys and next up we do have
the cap on D what are these called
everlasting glimmer veils these are like
a metallic a liquid lipstick and these
are going to retail for $22 each and the
shades are
wizard reverb satellite at Halawa tart
halibut or aerosol shock full dazzle and
rocker I think these look really really
cool they have a very very beautiful
kind of finish to them but I'm not real
super into liquid lipsticks again I have
to proceed with caution if I did pick
one of these up I probably want to pick
up one of these ciate glitter flips but
I'm definitely more interested in the
Seattle litter flips I do love Kat Von D
I really really like her brand I like a
lot of her products I believe these are
also vegan which is awesome they're
definitely cruelty free because it's Kat
Von D but yeah I just don't see myself
really wearing these I think the colors
look very very interesting if you like a
bright bold lip maybe you want to pick
that up but there are a lot of metallic
liquid lipsticks out there that for a
lot cheaper that are just as good I'm
the new midnight mermaid collection that
recently released from wet and wild had
some awesome awesome a liquid cat suit
metallic liquid lipsticks that I
personally like so I don't feel like I
need these and I really don't feel like
anybody else really needs them unless
you're absolutely a die-hard fan of
metallic liquid lipsticks all right guys
and finally we have a product here from
grow it wet and wild so this is actually
the new photo focus matte finish setting
a spray and now this is gonna retail for
$4.99 they also are going to be
releasing some photo focus color
correctors I'm pretty interested in the
color correctors but when it comes to
the matte finish setting spray I just
can't do math stuff anymore so this is a
very personal preference but one of the
reasons I wanted to talk about it here
is because I would highly recommend it
if you do a more combo to Whateley skin
I feel like you're gonna like this do
you want to know why because I love with
the photo focus settings braids the
original one it is one of the best
drugstore settings raised in fact one of
the best settings rates that you will
find high end and drugstore if you've
never tried it you absolutely should so
if you have more combo or dry skin I
would recommend the original one if
you're a little more on the oily side or
combo skin definitely go with the wet
and wild matte finish photo focus
setting spray but for me I just pull off
that not finished anymore I have a matte
foundation on today and I feel very flat
and I feel like you know a lot of it is
kind of kicking up a little bit I was
show tonight so I definitely kicked my
face a little more than I usually would
but yeah it's just kind of sad how my
skin is become so dry it's kind of worn
out you know like these Matt and Matt
products just don't look as good on me
so anyway guys that is my 5 and 5 anti
haul and will I buy I would love to know
down below what you guys think of this
and I would love to know if you would
like me to proceed by doing a more of
these where I kind of split up an anti
haul as well as like five products kind
of like a wish list that I'm interested
in but yeah thank you so much for
joining me and I guess I will see you
guys tomorrow
