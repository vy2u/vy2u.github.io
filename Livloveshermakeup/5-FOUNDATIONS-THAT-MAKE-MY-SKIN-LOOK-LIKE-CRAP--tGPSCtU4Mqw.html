welcome to my new beauty room here in
Arizona obviously not everything is set
up yet but this beauty room is way
bigger than the one that I did have in
Milwaukee I actually have a walk-in
bathroom and a walk-in closet combined
with this particular room so you guys
will definitely be seen a beauty room
tour once I get everything together
I actually went ahead and sold all my
furniture from my first Beauty room in
Milwaukee which I'll go ahead and link
that tour video above if you would like
to check it out if you're wondering why
everything is not all together yet it's
because I completely sold all that stuff
I'm so over the Alex series 9 drawer and
all the like the perfect white looking
Beauty broma I want something different
I want something a little darker I would
like something that was like a mirror to
finish and also a lot of silver and
stuff like that so and that is what I'm
thinking it for the new duty room but
anyway besides that yes I'm in Arizona
yes I have a little bit of a can we're
finally living down here and we are
really enjoying it so far so I wanted to
give you guys a little bit of an update
but today I am back to filming and we
are going to be talking about 5
different foundations that make up my
skin look like crap now ever since I
turned 24 years old which was about 11
months ago I turned 25 on August 1st so
in about a month I haven't noticed that
there are certain foundations that when
I put them on they just paged me they
just don't look the same on me either
they sink into my skin or they sit on
top of the skin it really emphasized
texture fine lines and wrinkles dry
patches and I think that's very very
unflattering I don't think any of us
want to look older maybe some people do
that's totally by whatever floats your
boat but the majority of us probably
don't want to so I thought I would share
with you guys some foundations that
really just kind of aged my skin and
don't look good on my skin they will
obviously be decluttered I'm going to do
a foundation declutter very soon for you
guys but the first one I want to talk
about here is actually from the
drugstore it's the Neutrogena hydro
boost hydrating tent now this is
something I'm thinking about giving a
second try or I guess like a fifth try I
tried all these foundations a million
different ways you guys I really have
tried to get them to work but anyway
this is a huge inna hydraboost hydrating
tent it does have hyaluronic acid it
says it moisturizes and plumps the skin
for 24 hours any shade that I wear is
called classic ivory in number 10 now
this has be seems sort of applicator as
say the Clinique beyond perfecting
foundation plus concealer I wear a 0.5
in that particular foundation but this
is what it looks like you can
swipe it on here scan hi today first
impressions on this and immediately I
could tell this speaks into my skin too
much it actually really emphasizes pores
because I feel like it just evaporates
into my skin it's almost like it's too
moisturizing now the reason why I say I
want to give this a third fourth or
fifth try is because now that I'm living
in the desert I do get the feeling that
this might work for me in the future and
now that I'm a little darker I feel like
the shape might work for me a little
better but for me personally I felt like
my face just looked like a saggy like a
weird like wet mop or something it was
just the strangest thing anytime I would
put this on camera people would ask me
like hey have you gotten enough sleep
like how are you doing are you okay it's
almost like I looked like you could fry
bacon on my face because I was so oily
but at the same time there was just all
this like sourness in my skin probably
because of the color and then on top of
that this area right here is really just
kind of made my skin almost look droopy
and I don't even know how to describe it
all I know is that this really didn't
sit beautifully on my skin now this is
what the actual shade match it looks
like and I have gotten quite a little
bit of a cam since we've been here but
as you can see it is very very yellow
toned and I have tried it mixing this
with in what white mixer I tried mixing
it with other foundations it just
doesn't look good so I'm going to give
it another try now that I'm in the
desert but yeah this is just something
that really doesn't look good on my skin
and I know a lot of people love it
let me know down below if it does work
for you but for me it didn't alright the
next one I want to talk about is me why
I felt Fusion ink foundation I've had
this in my collection for about six
months now we've been trying to get it
to work and this is what the outer
packaging looks like I will be returning
this you guys because it's about sixty
two dollars and that is a whole lot for
a foundation so you open it up like this
and then inside you do have a lil of the
last applicator where you kind of swipe
it on now this is more of a water or
serum based foundation if you have
incredibly incredibly oily skin I
actually think this would work really
well for you but because it is a water
versus water or serum based foundation I
really thought that it would help with
dry areas now I've combo skin so I'm
very oily in the t-zone and then I am
dry on the outer perimeters of my face
it makes everything stand out my fine
lines my wrinkles especially in this
area around my mouth which I have a lot
of little fine lines here because
obviously I place lift in every day when
I put my
sweet to my mouth I go like this and I
have an embouchure so I have the
beginnings of little lines right here so
it really really makes them stand out I
almost don't like this also really sunk
into the skin
and it just never ever ever looked good
on my skin even when I did the first
impression I was saying oh you know what
I can try it out with different primers
let's see how it goes you know it's just
one of those foundations where if it's
$62 like I shouldn't have to try so hard
to make it work I've tried it with
different sponges different brushes so
many different techniques and it's just
not something I want to keep in my
collection as you really shave b10
porcelain and I think one of the reasons
why I wanted to keep it so long in my
collection is because this is a great
shade match for me a very very light
porcelain color with a little bit of a
cool undertone but overall you guys it's
not something as that is worth investing
in if you have skin like me all right
moving on the next product I want to
talk about is be kept on the lock attack
to a foundation this particular one
right here is called light 42 I mix this
together with light 44 and I get my
perfect match this used to be a
foundation that looked absolutely
impeccable on my skin if you have a lot
to cover if you have very oily skin this
will work for you but the second that I
put this on my skin now even if I put a
little bit of oil in even if I'm wearing
something like my Bobbi Brown extra
vitamin enriched face base which is a
very very moisturizing primer as this
dries my skin out it ages my skin it
looks absolutely awful on my skin I
cannot get this to look pretty anymore
so a lot of you are recommending that I
go ahead and use this as a concealer I
think I'm going to go ahead and try that
out but I would really only recommend
this to those of you who you have a more
combo to oily skin at what you tend to
be a little more oily than combo if that
makes sense and also if you have a lot
to cover I don't know if you have dry
skin have you tried this how you get it
to work maybe I can keep it around on my
collection if you give me some tips and
tricks but it's just something that no
longer looks good on my skin alright the
next one I have here is another full
coverage foundation at just like the Kat
Von D's is the pur cosmetics bear at all
12-hour four in one skin perfecting of
foundation a rosy shade porcelain and
this was sent to me for PR so I cannot
purchase this with my own money it was
sent to me in exchange for an honest
review and my honest review is that I
don't like it I really try to get it to
work at one point with a what is it
called like an oval brush really to be
blending it into the skin this is the
thing about this foundation when you
first initially apply it
I think it looks absolutely terrific on
the skin but after three or four hours
of wear it starts to really break up it
starts to really get clogged and like
the nose pores areas right here like I'm
talking you know I have the beginnings
of fine lines under here which I don't
mind because I smile a lot like that's
okay that makes me happy but like when I
start to see fine lines all the way
under here and like what is going on
that has to be the product I'm using I
feel like this literally creates little
tiny lines increasing on my face no
matter how well I set it in so it's just
not a foundation that looks good on my
skin although it does look good
initially at the end of the day it looks
like and it's something I'm going
to be letting go of and then finally we
have the Revlon Colorstay whipped creme
and makeup used to love the Revlon
Colorstay line I love to be pressed
powder I absolutely love to be liquid
version I loved this I thought this was
gorgeous but unfortunately again it just
ages my face it really sinks into fine
lines wrinkles it emphasizes dry patches
if you do have any area that it's even
remotely give me even the smallest
amounts like remotely dry you will have
some sort of issue around this I just
feel like it doesn't go on beautifully
it doesn't glide on really nicely and
even when I use some sort of a silicon
based primer hydrating primer a damp
sponge any sort of application technique
I seem to have issues with this
particular foundation so again if you do
have more dry skin or if you do have
fair like my age and you can use this
feel you know let me know let me know
what you're doing to get it to work but
for me personally it doesn't work and
I'm not trying to say that has
everything to do with my age I'm just
saying it makes me look older when I'm
wearing this foundation and I try to
apply and know a nice amount of it I've
tried to find a very small amount of it
I've tried applying it and mixing it
with different foundations it still just
doesn't look flattering on me and it's
just not something I feel like I can
pull up any more so anyway I hope you
guys enjoyed this video on five
foundations that make my skin look like
crap let me know down below if these
work for you let me know if they don't
work for you and I guess I will see you
guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
