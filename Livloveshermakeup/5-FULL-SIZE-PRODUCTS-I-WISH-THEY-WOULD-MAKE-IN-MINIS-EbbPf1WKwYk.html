my channel happy Monday today I wanted
to walk you guys through five full-size
makeup products that I wish they would
make in mini is now I think so far and
also have been doing a great job
with their mini section okay it's very
in right now because first of all you
can get half the product for half the
price it's a really really great way for
people to be able to test out a product
before investing the full 30 or $40 or
$50 on the actual big full-size but also
I just think it's very smart for Sephora
to do this because a lot of people do
like deluxe sizes a lot of people don't
feel like they're actually gonna use up
a whole goddamn eyeshadow palette or in
whole powder so in my opinion that minis
makes sense and I want to walk you guys
through five different products that I
think they should make it mini so the
first one is the modern renaissance
palette there is no reason why they
shouldn't have like a little sex tattoo
or a quintet of five or six different
shades from the modern renaissance in a
mini palette I think it would be great
because a lot of people are actually
scared to buy this palette although it
has great great reviews a lot of people
say well can I pull off the berry tone
trend you never know and tell you trying
it so if they would take this and cut
the price in half and do sixty different
shades I think that would be amazing or
even seven different shades they could
do real car and Venetian red or love
letter and then maybe born fresco and
then a few of the warmer tone shades and
you would get the taste of the palette
before going and purchasing the
full-size also I would love to have a
maybe form of this for a travel I think
that would be fantastic this is a great
palette from Anasazi of Beverly Hills so
the first one that I wish they would
make in a MIDI is the modern renaissance
from a Nastasia Beverly Hills up next we
have the Urban Decay Naked skin a
foundation now I feel like a lot of
foundations should be in mini size just
because it's really nice to be able to
test out a mini sized foundation before
going and investing your money in a
full-sized you want to make sure your
skin will react well with it you want to
make sure it's not gonna make you break
out and get rashes all over your face
and you need to use it consecutively for
a few weeks I personally feel like a
sample runs out pretty darn quick when
it comes to foundation so I really like
deluxe sized foundations now a lot of
brands have already jumped on this train
but Urban Decay Naked skin and they have
their Naked skin concealer in the mini
but come on you should do it with the
foundation this is a best-selling
foundation on the sephora.com website it
works for all sorts of different skin
types as well as different skin tones
because they have a wonderful color
selection again
I feel like it just kind of comes back
to you best selling products should have
a mini and I love this I love this when
I was a skip I loved this when I had
combination skin I love it when I have
dry skin this is a fantastic
foundation so absolutely I would say
Urban Decay would make a lot more money
if they would go ahead and put this into
a trial size for people to try out all
right guys moving on to the Too Faced
Born This Way ethereal setting powder I
know this is relatively new which is
probably why there is no little deluxe
size of this but like this one and the
Kat Von D powder there should be smaller
sizes this retails were a good at 30 or
35 dollars and that's a lot for a powder
it's very hard for people to make the
decision to go ahead and purchase this
when you can get great powders at the
drugstore like the essence all about
Matt fixing contact powder for 399 or
the elf tone correcting powder for 399
you know it's very hard to go and invest
in a full sized powder but I love this
powder I've absolutely fallen in love
with it the more I use it the more I
like it I think they should make this in
a minute it would be a very smart move
on to face part especially because
lately to face hasn't been releasing the
best products but this is a good one a
very very good product so the Too Faced
Born This Way powder I wish they would
go ahead and make it a mini and it'll be
great for travel as well
alright guys moving right along to
violet boss I recently talked about how
I feel like their pallets are overpriced
however I still think they're good
quality I just feel like they should be
priced a little lower so what I would
think is cool is maybe if they went
ahead and they put together again
a little bit of a quilt or a sex attempt
and they kind of put together a pallet
sort of similar like a mini Modern
Renaissance so you can have a three max
on the top and three shimmers on the
bottom the violet box is very very well
known for having super super nice foiled
of shadows so if they went ahead and
took like their best selling shades kind
of like biggie or 1988 from like the
Laura Lee palette and they did some of
their duo crumbs from the ride-or-die
palette and they put it into a smaller
palette and priced it lower at a teeny I
honestly think they would make so many
more sales at Sephora it already looks
like viola vos isn't doing so well at
Sephora so I think would be smart for
them to go ahead and make a mini palette
and then finally guys the last little
product I want to talk about are these
Tila glitter and glows I think they
should have a mini individual little
guide that you can purchase for 9 to 10
dollars I think that would be
absolutely perfect I recently talked
about these in a video all about beauty
products that I would reprice and kind
of lower so these go for I believe 24
dollars 23 or 24 dollars I would bring
them down to 18 but if you did have a
mini it which a lot of people aren't
gonna go ahead and use these up as
quickly as I do because a lot of people
don't want to wear glitter on a daily
basis but if you have minis and you
purchase them for 9 or 10 dollars it's a
great way to try different colors out
it's a really really great way to just
have something for special occasions and
honestly a lot of people either love or
hate to these Stila glitter and glows
they are in liquid form some people
don't like when they dry it down they
have a little bit of fallout some people
just don't like the formula in general
they find them difficult to blend so I
think let's fish to go ahead and release
little mini individuals of it there see
a liquid or and glows I know that in
some of their holiday sets they do have
smaller versions but if they did them
individually that would be it's
fantastic so anyway guys those are 5
different beauty products that I wish
these brands will go ahead and make a
mini stuff let me know down below your
top 5 and I will see you guys tomorrow
