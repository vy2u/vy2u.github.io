channel today I am sharing with you guys
five different makeup brands I am
interested in trying out to this summer
I'm actually really excited I've seen
Elle as well as I believe in jelica and
definitely Samantha do videos kind of
similar to this talking about brands
they've never purchased from before as
well as brands are interested and
intrigued with so I'll go ahead and
throw all their videos up in the cards
but yeah there are some beauty brands
that I have not purchased from I know
that I am definitely a collector and I
do collect a lot of makeup I have had
the opportunity to purchase from a lot
of different brands but these ones I
never have and I'm very very intrigued
with them so let's go ahead and jump
right into it guys I want to start with
nabla cosmetics I believe this is an
Italian brand and I think the first
person that I saw talking about this
brand was actually Jai kisaan if they
have two different eye shadow palettes
called the dreamy eyeshadow palette as
well as the soul bloomin palette which
is the nuber one and then look amazing
now I will say the dreamy palette when I
look at it I'm like it's pretty basic
it's pretty neutral about the photo I'm
going to insert so you guys can see is
actually the soil blooming next to the
dreamy palette and you can see how
beautifully these two palettes
complement each other so I'm definitely
interested in looking into this brand
I've heard they have wonderful wonderful
eyeshadow singles as well and that's so
blooming palette even if I don't get the
dreamy palette to go along with it
is just gorgeous you can see those
shades and garden-gate as well as
flowery and also bolero I'm like yep yes
yes I love the coral I love the kind of
periwinkles
it's almost pastel like but they have a
little more depth to them and I'm really
really into that as well as the cool
toned vibe so that is the first brand
that I am definitely interested in
trying out this summer up next we have
give me Glo cosmetics this is more of
like an indie brand that became very
very popular a couple of months ago when
Sophie from trend mood actually posted
this picture right here called halo and
this is their halo highlighter and as
you can see it's gorgeous you have that
greenish a bluish base with a gold shift
going on and it is just absolutely
stunning you can see the pigmentation is
there it looks buttery it looks soft so
I was very excited when I saw that they
were going to be releasing a 9 pan full
sized highlighter palette now this
highlighter palette has a ton
different shades going on here I believe
these are also going to double as
eyeshadows so they are eye safe you have
a periwinkle color you have two kind of
neutral a bronzy colors you do have a
lighter color a darker reddish color a
pink as well as to a darker bronze
shades and I just think this is gorgeous
it is going to retail for $75 but keep
in mind and these are full pans these
are full sizes and I think it looks
amazing and I really wanted to try out
halo which is included in this palette
so by the time you guys are watching
this video this is already released I
probably have already picked it up this
is a free film video if you guys are
wondering but another thing that I also
really like about give me Glo cosmetics
is their palettes have that little thing
where you can actually pick the product
out so if you would like to go ahead and
purchase some of their single
highlighters or their single eyeshadows
you can swap them in and out of
different palettes it's sort of like the
original Anasazi of Beverly Hills glow
kits which is awesome
speaking of that here is their eyeshadow
palette that again also released on the
first this is called these summer vibes
palette and there's something about this
color combo that I am really really
feeling now I have to say I'm definitely
over the warm tone trend when it comes
to eyeshadows but I feel like it's not
overly warm you guys can see there are
definitely two different shades here
that are a little more cool tone you
have Brazilian bikini as well as summer
fling which is kind of like a shimmery
aquamarine color you do have some
champagne colors you have peach snow
cone which looks like the greatest
transition you also have a bright yellow
and then a few different kind of beige
and also brown tones which would be
great for the crease a lot of these look
matte a lot of them are shimmer I feel
like this is a great palette just
looking at it I feel like the quality is
gonna be really good watches that I've
seen of this palette so far look amazing
so this is another palette that is
definitely on my list and then I also
have to show you guys I'm not quite sure
when these bundles are releasing but
they have little mini liquid lipstick a
bundles this first folder right here is
called got nudes the shades you have are
Cupid as well as dirty-blond let's
cuddle and hocus-pocus and then also
they have this a little bundle right
here which is called the bestsellers
bundle and you have pumpkin and spices
dirty pumpkin sweater brother and girls
night so I'm not quite sure if those are
really going to be summer shades for me
I might pick those up and I know for
sure I'm going to get the got nudes
bundle because those look amazing
again I want to go ahead and try out
their liquid lipstick formula move on to
another brand that I found via Instagram
thanks to a few of you this is called
route pretty and this is like an all
natural vegan non-toxic sort a brand and
they have these really cool looking lip
balms the first one I'm very much
interested in is called Houston which is
like a oxblood
deep kind of orange e red and I'm also
very interested in blossom pretty and
again I feel like obviously these look
pretty darn basic they don't look like
they're anything super super special but
I am a lover of those colors I really
like that dark kinda orangie red as well
as this really beautiful your lips but
better sort of shade and I'm a huge
sucker for comfortable lip products so
this is another brand I'm interested in
looking into they also do a lot of loose
pavements and things like that I'm not
great with loose pigments whether it be
in highlighter form like a loose
highlighter or an actual loose eyeshadow
these are the two items that I am most
interested in trying out from them let's
go ahead and move into stellar beauty
this is a cruelty free brand that is
currently being sold at Sephora there
are two different products from them
that I'm very very intrigued with the
first one being their brilliant primer
which retails for $35 and the second
being their limitless foundation which
retails for 28:38 dollars 28 would be a
steal
38 still isn't bad for a foundation so
there are 21 different shades to choose
from when it comes to the foundation and
on top of that this is actually a
radiant full coverage finish which is
very hard to find you guys know I
currently I'm dealing with a very very
dry skin so I would love something
that's full coverage that isn't too
matte so I really want to look into that
and then when it comes to the brilliant
primer just beautiful aesthetic goals
when it comes to these bottles but this
is kind of like a pink hue to primer and
it's supposed to help your makeup to not
only wear longer throughout the day it's
also supposed to be brightening and not
like a shiny sort of illuminating
brightening just like regular
brightening and then also it supposed to
be quite hydrating definitely interested
in looking into some makeup from stellar
Beauty let me know if you tried anything
out from the brand and finally we have
Anton Emma I mentioned this brand when I
did my video all about cruelty-free
shopping at Sephora which I'll go ahead
and throw up in the cards very very
drawn in by their organic certified
highlighting blush this reminds me a lot
of like Milan E's Luminoso blush really
really cool packaging a little more like
woodsy yes
say and this is a baked highlight blush
that imparts color and radiance to your
cheeks it is $42 but it is organic and
they have about a four and a half star
rating on these two 4.com website I know
that's super super expensive for a blush
but I at least want to try something out
from the brand and then the other item
that is catching my eye is their
certified organic beige foundation now
they say this is light coverage is
supposed to be good for normal oily
combination and dry skin I would
probably go with you shade light or
light medium it does retail for $38 and
this is probably the first item that
I'll pick up so I can kind of sample the
brand but it's supposed to leave a light
Demi matte finish I don't even know how
it can be Demi matte when it's a powder
but we'll see I personally haven't had
great luck with powder foundations in
the past but I am willing to go ahead
and give this a go so guys those are the
five different brands that I have never
tried that I am interested in checking
out this summer yes I will see you guys
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
