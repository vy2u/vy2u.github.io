my channel today's video is going to be
all about makeup products that were
initially very very hyped about but
unfortunately they have their 5 minutes
of fame and nobody really talks about
them anymore now at the end did this
video I'm going to go ahead and flip
that around and talk about a product
that nobody really talked about when it
first came out but now it's starting to
get a little bit of recognition and I'm
very happy because it's a very good
foundation so I'll save that for the end
of the video but anyway let's go ahead
and jump right into it so the first
thing I want to talk about is just a
brand in general the pretty a vulgar
cosmetics brand sold at Sephora really
was very hyped about when it first came
out in the springtime but I feel like
nobody really talks about their products
anymore the first one I have here is the
feathers of mascara I also picked up
their setting spray which I'm not really
a fan of I do have this little guy right
here which is the shimmering Swan
highlight which i think is really
beautiful very nice formula I would like
to see them come out with more shades of
this and then finally I do have a
nightingale eye shadow palette now you
guys know I love me some cool toned
eyeshadows so this is definitely a
palette that I do enjoy in my collection
but overall I feel like this was a brand
that really had their 5 minutes of fame
not a lot of people talk about them
anymore and it's kind of sad because
they were so hyped about when they first
came out but I really think they need to
work on at some of their products a
little more and put a little more money
into the actual products instead of the
packaging all right moving on guys we
have a highlight here from a Too Faced
now I purchased all three of these when
they first came out so these are the
love like prismatic highlighters now if
you did watch my review on these which
I'll go ahead and throw up in the cards
you knew with that I did keep this
little guy right here which is called
you light up my life I actually like
this as kind of like a blush topper cuz
this really beautiful golden glow to my
cheeks so I did decide to go ahead and
keep this one it was definitely the best
as far as formulation is concerned out
of the other ones I felt like all of
them did have a little bit of shimmer
and glitter to them which I'm really not
into but I feel like so many people
we're very excited about these
highlighters because first of all we're
really really adorable packaging as
usual when it comes to Too Faced and
second of all this was a new formula
they had never done anything kind of
like a big shell a highlight so people
were very very excited but unfortunately
a lot of people were let down these are
just not that great of highlighters they
do hit hard pan pretty quickly or you
get hard pan pretty quick
and it's just one of those things where
some people really like them some people
did not I was one of the people that
didn't love them they weren't super
super blinding like I thought they would
be you know when they called them love
light two prismatic eyeliner I really
thought they would be a little more
grand-am in your face but they're a
little more subtle I do enjoy this one
we'll see if I keep it around in my
collection but those are definitely a
product that had their 5 minutes of fame
up next we have the Coastal Scents
revealed palettes I think I have two or
three of these I love these palettes I
have done so many deep letters on my
channel and these never leave my sight
they are very very good quality you guys
now I am NOT a fan of the V naked
palettes from Urban Decay although I do
you enjoy our batik as a brand I would
not say that those eyeshadow palettes
are very good quality in my opinion
these right here are very very nice and
I know Coastal Scents is kind of one of
those brands that's headed out the door
I want to do a video for you guys soon
talking about two brands like who will
be around in five years or ten years and
who won't let me know you're interested
in seeing that but I definitely feel
like Coastal Scents is not as popular as
it used to be now when these first came
out they were the first kind of dupe for
the Naked palette so everybody talked
about them everybody raved about them
and I feel like nobody really does
anymore but these are still very good
quality and I would recommend you guys
check them out Coastal Scents 8ly
cruelty free brand as far as I'm
concerned as far as I know are you guys
moving on let's talk about the honest
hacia Beverly Hills blush trios these
came out not too long ago and I feel
like they were very very hyped up
because people were like oh my God look
at those those look so beautiful and now
I feel like nobody talks about these now
it's kind of weird how they set this up
because honest hacia Beverly Hills is
now releasing a blush kits so I kind of
have that that was weird that they did
the blush trios and the blush trios
didn't do so well so maybe that's why
they're releasing the blush kits or like
you know kind of like the sister product
to the glow kits so we'll see how those
go but honestly these are great these
are fantastic fantastic blushes some of
the best that I have in my collection so
I was really surprised that a lot of
people didn't talk about these they
definitely had their 5 minutes of fame I
don't know if you will see these
continuing on in the anasazi of Beverly
Hills collection just because I feel
like the blush kits in general are just
gonna go better because there's
well known for their glow kits but this
is definitely a good formula and I would
recommend these to you guys alright and
finally I have to talk about the
hourglass ambient lighting strobing
powder is now I feel like when people
talk about hourglass it's always the
ambient lighting blushes or the ambient
lighting powders these are different I
know it's weird but these aren't
different these are the strobing powders
these are ones that have a little more
of like a finely milled a glitter in
there when they first came out so many
people were talking about them and now I
feel like nobody talks about them on
YouTube except for me you know I love
the ambient lighting formula so of
course I rave about these they are
gorgeous they blend into the skin they
look amazing so I thought I would go
ahead and throw those in there they are
a beautiful beautiful highlights but I
don't feel like a lot of people talk
about them they get fluey had a myth
they definitely had their 5 minutes of
fame now let's go ahead and talk about
the foundation that I feel like was not
hyped up at all when it first came out
but or when it first came out but now it
really is it is the Josie Maran vibrancy
foundation fluid I have the shape
dynamic which is way too light for me
currently if you have very very light
skin with a cool undertone this is a
great shade this works for me when I
lived in Milwaukee when I had combo oily
skin this works for me down here when I
have dry skin is beautiful argan oil
infused in here when it first came out
and nobody really talked about it I
talked about it but nobody else really
talked about it I did a first
impressions on it I instantly fell in
love and now I feel like more people are
talking about it I just recently saw the
Talia the Talia I don't know how to say
her channel name but Taylor here on
YouTube do a first impressions on this
I've seen a lot of people talking about
this recently like Jacqueline Hill as
well so it's definitely a foundation
that did not get okay that is the second
time that my sd card has filled up in
the past like 48 hours I've been taking
a lot of photos on this Canon EOS Rebel
t5 this is the one I take photos on for
my Instagram as well as pictures of my
favorites for their Instagram so sorry
about that SD card got told but what I
was trying to say was this particular
foundation did not get a lot of hype
when it first came out but now it is and
I'm very very happy about that so that
is it for today's video guys I hope you
this video please let me know down below
if you have any products in your
collection they have their 5 minutes of
fame and I guess I will see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
