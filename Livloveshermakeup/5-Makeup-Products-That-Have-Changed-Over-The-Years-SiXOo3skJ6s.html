my channel today I'm gonna be walking
you guys through five different makeup
products that have changed her out to
the years now please let me know if you
would also like me to do a video all
about like skincare products that have
changed her out the years other just
beauty products in general but today but
like I said we are sticking with just
makeup now I want to say really quickly
I was so interested in doing a video on
how makeup trends have changed
throughout the years I thought that
maybe I would be a good example of this
because I think guys can tell I'm not
someone who really stays up-to-date with
all of the latest and makeup trends
there's a lot of makeup trends that I'm
just not into and I know some people may
say my makeup is outdated or I don't
like the way you do your eyeliner or
those clumpy lashes like why but there
is a reason for it and it's just because
I like it and I enjoy it and I thought
maybe I would be a good example of
someone who does do more outdated sort
of makeup trends but still kind of works
them into my routine so let me know if
you're also interested in a video like
that but anyway let's go ahead and just
jump right into it and change is not
necessarily a bad thing okay but when it
comes to makeup and when it comes to
products that you absolutely love
formula changes can definitely be a
little bit on the irritating side so
let's go ahead and talk about some
products that have changed for the
better or have they change for the worse
alright so I'm gonna start with a powder
and that has been a favorite of mine
ever since college and unfortunately it
has started to change a little bit for
the worse I'm talking about the
hourglass ambient lighting powder is now
I really really do notice that there is
something going on here about a year and
a half ago I purchased two full sizes of
ethereal light which was my go-to
highlight in college before the big a
blinding highlight trend or stripe on
your face you can see me from outer
space kind of thing was going on and one
of them I am currently panning but this
guy right here I have barely touched now
I recently picked up a little mini of
the ambient lighting powder in diffused
light I am currently panning this one I
know a lot of people ask me how do I pan
at these guys so quickly
I use these every day - every single day
to set a my under-eye I used to use them
for highlighting or even setting my
whole entire face but currently I use
these for setting my under eyes so this
little guy was purchased about I would
say a month and a half ago and I have to
say there's a difference there is a
difference with this formula and it
really really is semi upsetting because
what they're doing is actually taking
chunks of glitter or just flecks of
glitter and actually infusing it into
the product I swear to you the old ones
didn't have any sort of glitter in there
so I'm a little upset please let me know
if you have recently purchased a
full-size and if you notice any sort of
glitter but I swear back in the day they
didn't have glitter so that is the first
product I want to talk about up next I
want to talk about the rainforest of the
sea eyeshadow palette formula from tarts
now if these bets have only really been
on the market for the past two years but
I have to say every single one of them
even though they claimed that they were
going to be the same formula has changed
so we started with volume one and this
is what Paul you won that looks like and
I was extremely happy and impressed when
this first came out because it was very
different for tarts and this is
definitely more of like a foiled formula
I'm a huge sucker for foiled eyeshadows
especially if I can work them into my
crease and work them into my outer-v all
that kind of stuff and I could do that
with this formula so when they announced
that they were coming out with the
second volume I was like oh yeah I'm
there for it I'm ready and especially
because this had more cool tones in it I
went ahead and I scooped it up this was
even better than the first formula and I
was like hell yeah they're doing it
they're doing an amazing job and this
was pressed a little more firmly I was
just very very very excited and then
unfortunately about six months ago they
went ahead and they released a volume 3
volume 3 is completely different
even worse than volume 1 it has just a
huge amount of pigment to it but at the
same time it's chunky it has a lot of
Fallout and it's just not something that
I use on my eyes personally now and this
one was marketed as a highlighting
palette as well as an eye palette today
I am wearing it as a highlight it is
great for highlighting this is something
that goes into my highlighting palette
drawer the shade that I have on today is
called compass which is my favorite gold
shade from the palette but unfortunately
I can't put this on my eyes and I really
wish that if they were going to go ahead
and release you know the rainforest of
the sea eyeshadow collection why can't
you just stick with the same formula
throughout you know what I mean if it's
all gonna be within the same collection
and you're expecting the same sort of
thing why can't it be the same formula
so
is definitely a formula that has started
to kind of take a turn for the worst at
first it was getting better and then now
it's starting to get worse so we'll see
how the target rain force of the see
volume for pallet is which I heard is in
the making currently all right up next
we have the wet and wild color iconic
blushes as you guys can see from the
little sticker right here it says new
formula and they definitely went ahead
and change the packaging as well as the
formula now for me I feel like the
overall you know feel of these got a lot
better they're a little more finely
milled they feel very soft and cushy do
the actual touch however the
pigmentation is just not there anymore
I used to have pearlescent pink this
particular shade is called rosacea
champagne through to 6b I used to have
pearlescent pink and I really really
enjoyed the amount of pigment that I had
right off the bat so I would go in with
my blush and I would go in with my brush
and then I go into the blush and just
pick it up and put it right on I didn't
have to tap off the excess it was just a
perfect amount of pigmentation I'm
normally someone who would probably like
a formula like this that I build up on
the cheeks because I don't like to go
ham when it comes to my blush however
there's just something lacking here when
it comes to pigmentation and it's not
just this shade this shade right here is
obviously very mundane kind of bland
it's beautiful it's very neutral and
natural something I enjoy but I do feel
like I have to do a lot of building of
this blush to get the kind of
pigmentation that I want so that is
definitely a formula that I feel like
has kind of changed for the worse but I
feel like some people might think it has
changed for the better because you know
you kind of can build it up on your
cheeks instead of going in and
immediately get in clown face which
again I didn't feel like the original
formula gave you clown face back some
people did alright moving on let's talk
about a concealer here that has
definitely gotten better this is from
Kat Von D and this is the Lockett tattoo
concealer crap now you may still be able
to find those little squeezy tubes I
think that's like on sale right now at
Sephora of the old Kat Von D lock a
tattoo concealer from what I understand
this is the new reformulated version and
they will be going ahead and taking
those other ones off the market now for
those ones do not have a good shade
selection I had it the lighter shade
which was called light it was a very
very dark on me and oxidized like crazy
so I was really happy when she went
ahead and updated the packaging as well
as the formula so now you have this
really really nice little wand as you
guys can see and you have such an
arrangement of colors especially if you
fair skin tone and this is an awesome
concealer it is full coverage it doesn't
crease throughout the day it's
definitely up there with my top 5
concealers please let me know if you
want me to do a video on my top 5
concealers but this particular shade is
called whiteout it actually is a mixer
for concealers which is just genius I
haven't seen another brand do that
before I see a lot of white foundation
mixers but not white concealer mixers so
this is definitely a product that has
gotten an upgrade it has definitely
gotten better so yeah that's the Kat Von
D Lockett tattoo concealer creme alright
guys then finally I have to talk about
the 9 pan palette from Too Faced in the
natural aversion you guys can see this
is a well-loved palette from me
personally I have to say this has
definitely changed throughout the years
I recently did pick up the tin version
of this because I wanted to try it out
again I tried the tin version out
probably about four years ago this is
the old school cardboard and then I
ended up decluttering that one recently
picked it up again
I'm decluttering it it's just not the
same it's just not the same if you were
one of the lucky people that got to go
ahead and actually get this old-school
packaging you would know that this
formula was something very very special
this reminds me of like the peanut
butter and jelly formula and not the
peanut butter and honey but the peanut
butter and jelly formula very foil very
nice not overly pigmented shadows that
you can build up you know and this is
called the natural eye palette and I
feel like everything in here is great
the mats are smooth they're buttery
they're creamy they're not patchy
they're not dried this was just such a
good formula and I feel like the
nine pound pallets nowadays are very
much a hit or miss when it comes to Too
Faced and especially the new nine pam
palette in the natural light version
they changed the packaging and they
changed the formula and honestly it's
for the worse because this was this was
a gentleman so anyway guys that's it so
those are my top 5 makeup products that
have changed throughout the years let me
know down below if you have any that you
would like to add to the list thank you
so much for joining me and I will see
you guys tomorrow for a video all about
fall makeup trends I know that I'm
really late to the game on this one but
I know it's kind of a basic bitch video
as well but I mean I want to be a basic
bitch for one day and go ahead and film
that video so that will be up tomorrow
and then I have some reviews coming up
for you guys this weekend and yeah I
guess we'll see you that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
