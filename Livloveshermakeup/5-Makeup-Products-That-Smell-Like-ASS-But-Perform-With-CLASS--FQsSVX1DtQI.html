my channel I'm sure you guys can
probably hear it in my voice but I have
come down with the quite the severe
sinus infection so I'm sorry I wasn't
able to get a video up yesterday and I'm
sorry for the nasally sound today but I
really wanted to jump on here and do a
video all about five different makeup
products that cement-like asked a book
perform of class yes it is possible for
makeup to just have a little bit of a
pungent smell it doesn't necessarily
mean it has gone bad and it doesn't
necessarily mean that the ingredients in
there are bad for your skin I feel like
I'm one of those people that has talked
about like morphe eyeshadows before and
I say oh my god they smell like ass they
gave me eye irritation and yes those
products personally didn't work for me
but these five products that I'm about
to share with you guys actually do work
for me there's nothing in here that ever
gives me skin irritation or makes me
break out so I never want to scare you
guys away from these products just
because they do have a little bit of a
toxic ii sort of sour scent to them
doesn't necessarily mean if they have
gone bad or that they are a bad at
product so anyway guys let's go ahead
and jump right into it first we have the
wet and wild photo focus foundation I
wear the shade porcelain which is a
little too light for me currently but I
really like this for my dry skin I would
say the scent is kind of like paint
thinner which I know sounds horrible but
once you actually get it onto the face
and blend it out you can no longer smell
it the scent it does remind me a little
bit of the Kat Von D lock-it tattoo
foundation as well as the concealer and
also the Becca ultimate coverage
complexion creme and the concealer it's
got just a little bit of a paint thinner
sort of plasticky scent to it but it
hasn't gone bad it is a good product and
it just because it does have a little
bit of a weird ascent to it and it is a
very very cheap from the drugstore
doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad
product as long as I go ahead and prime
my face really nicely before going in
with this foundation I love the look of
it on my skin in fact this has been one
of my favorite medium coverage
foundations recently so that's the first
product I want to talk about up next we
have the violet Boss Pro eyeshadow
palettes now for me I know that morphe
ingredients are kind of similar to the
viola boss
eyes shadow ingredients but I have to
say I've never had any sort of eye
irritation with any of these palettes
and there are a ton of different
finishes in here the one thing I will
say about viola vos across the board is
I do feel like a lot of their products
are a little overpriced
this guy right here is called the drench
metal pallet if you are a lover of
really really nice foiled shadows and
you only want a couple mats in your
pallet and you love cool toned
eyeshadows I'm sure you would enjoy that
pallet if you are a lover of all sorts
of different textures when it comes to
your eyeshadows I think you would love
to lauralee pallet even these really
really press the letters up here even if
I get them in my eye I don't have
irritation so they may have a little bit
of a sour scent to them but honestly
these go on beautifully and then finally
we do have the holy grail pallets from
violet vos and this was something that I
would say is completely compare
comparable in my opinion to like at the
modern of Renaissance palette I actually
prefer some of the finishes in this
palette so if you love those beautiful
beautiful kind of ma p red tones you
would enjoy it this a lot re the next
product that I want to talk about is and
they tart aqua sealer concealer this is
actually one of my all-time favorite
concealers when I did a first
impressions on it way back probably
about two years ago I was thinking in my
head my goodness does this have that
very very strong paint sort of smell to
it it's got this huge a doe foot
applicator but like I said it's one of
my go-to concealers I feel like
especially using something around my
mouth area and right here and for spot
concealing if I were to get any sort of
skin irritation from that fragrance
level in there I would have already
noticed it especially because I do get
more sensitive around my eye area so
that's another concealer that I've never
had any sort of problems with whatsoever
and then here like I said earlier the
Becca ultimate coverage complexion crema
line whether it be the concealer or
whether it be the foundation these
really have a super plasticky set to
them actually when I first got mine I
thought this was completely bad because
you can kind of smell when a product has
gone bad I feel like the three things to
look out for it when you are
investigating to see if your makeup has
gone bad is smell as well as texture
consistency that kind of thing so for me
I was noticing that the consistency on
this was really really nice and creamy
it was going on beautifully I had just
opened it up but the scent was so crazy
as strong and now like I said I don't
get any irritation around my eye area if
I do use this around my eye area it's
very creamy very humectant great if you
do have dry skin but also and this is
awesome for spot concealing that's
basically what I use it for if you guys
are curious I do really shade praline
and when I have one layer self-tan this
is perfect for me so although it does
smell
it may have gone bad it's a great
product I've never noticed that the
consistency has changed or that the
texture has started to break up on my
face throughout the day so the Becca
ultimate coverage complexion creme
concealer is a really really nice one
for spot concealing especially if you do
have dry of skin
all right guys and the last product I
want to mention in this video is kind of
like a L face palette whole I'm talking
about their bronzer palette their
illuminating palette as well as their
light and dark blush palettes recently I
did have to go ahead and declutter my
light and dark I actually have to go
ahead and toss them out because I did
notice they went bad I will tell you
right now what I notice when it comes to
powder blushes as well as powder
bronzers I noticed that they go bad when
they start to get those tiny little
white dots at the top or the texture
starts to change so if you have a smooth
a beautiful soft powder and suddenly
you're getting these little bubbles on
top of it or even just a light little
dots all over it most likely it has gone
bad so unfortunately I had both of those
blush palettes in my collection too long
I kind of regret it because I didn't get
enough use out of them but let me tell
you these are fabulous products I love
the illuminating palette the bronzer
palette and the contour palette all
sorts of different palettes from elf
cosmetics are great they're very
pigmented they're very very blendable on
the skin and they have all sorts of
different color selections so those are
definitely a palette that I would
recommend looking into you can choose
something that you want to pick up for
around the 5 to 10 dollar mark just
because they smell a little strange does
not mean that they are a strange product
so anyway guys that's it those are 5
different makeup products that have a
little bit about sort of smell to them
but they perform beautifully so thank
you so much for joining me guys and I
will see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
