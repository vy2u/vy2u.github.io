thank you so much for joining me in this
video you guys are gonna watch me
attempt to do a full face of makeup in
five minutes this is the five minute
makeup challenge and this is a
collaboration video with my friend
Tiffany dawn here on YouTube tiffany has
been a subscriber of mine for a while
she's so supportive of my channel she
comments on every single video I
appreciate her so much and she recently
made a youtube channel herself and I
would really really love if you guys
went over and said hello to her on her
video or just checked out her channel I
think she's wonderful she's a
stay-at-home mom and she really does
post very very frequently like three to
four times a week and I love the video
she does she does a lot of like halls
and she does top five series videos very
similar to my channel so I think you
guys would really really like her and I
would appreciate if he went over and
said hello to her or at least checked
out her channel so anyway she brought to
me and was like do you want to do a
collab in all ye yes I do and we were
either going to do the no mirror makeup
challenge which is a video I probably
will do in the future and probably like
fail at it miserably um but then we
decided the five minute makeup challenge
would be a lot of fun also I think these
are really entertaining videos and I'm
hoping the fact that I move very quickly
and I have a lot of energy will allow me
to get a full face of makeup on in under
five minutes so let's go ahead and get
started I am going to first of all turn
my volume on on my phone so if you start
hearing things like emails or text
messages I apologize we are going to put
this on a 45 minutes and let's get
started there we go five minutes okay
