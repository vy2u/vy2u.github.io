thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a fantastic day
today's video is going to be a little
different i have never actually filmed
one of these i'm one of those people
that always disliked I don't know I'm
always keeping it positive and never
really talking about products that
didn't work for me but my friend Meg or
Meg Bernardo here on YouTube asked me if
I wanted to clap and she came up with
this brilliant idea of showing you guys
5 products that did not actually work
out for us basically so she's going to
be showing you guys five products that
didn't work for her and I'm showing you
guys five products it didn't work for me
and like I said I like to keep my
channel very like update and just like
oh yeah I love everything but the truth
is I don't nobody does if you have the
kind of collection that I do beauty wise
skincare you know makeup hair care stuff
like that there usually is or there are
products that just didn't work out for
you and I don't always focus on them and
I try not to talk about them but I am
ready I am here I'm going to talk about
them today and I think it's like a great
idea and if you guys like these kind of
videos let me know because I do run
across a lot of products that I just
don't end up liking and you guys may
have seen my declutter videos where I
basically decluttered a lot of products
that I didn't end up liking but these
are products besides those ones that I
actually don't like so I am going to
give you guys a five of them and again
just because they don't work for me or
they didn't work for me does not mean
that they won't work for you this is
just my personal opinion I'm gonna let
you guys know what they are and of
course why I didn't like them but anyway
like I said this is a collab with my
friend Meg I will link both of her
channels below her Instagram she is
awesome I love her she is a very very
calm and cool and collected and she just
gives like her honest opinion she's just
very very like honest and just is who
she is and I love that about people i
love love love that about people i love
when they're not trying to be something
that they're not you can tell that she
just is who she is and I just really
really appreciate that about her um she
does beautiful tutorials she does a lot
of videos on skincare she does like does
like these real talk videos where she
just sits down and gives her opinion on
that are happening in the world or the
YouTube community and I think she's
absolutely awesome and she's really
become a good friend of mine here on
youtube so I do hope that you guys would
go over and check out her channel
definitely subscribe to her I think
you're gonna love her realness and I
love her voice and she is such a cool
calming effect on me and I don't know if
I've ever told you guys about this but
um like my boyfriend my best friend a
lot of people that are in my life have
like a very very like calming like a
calm demeanor if that makes sense which
is basically the exact opposite of me
I'm very very kind of like whoa you know
I have a lot of energy but when I am
mixed up with tons and tons of people
that have that kind of energy I just get
too excited so I love people like Meg
she reminds me like her personality
reminds me a lot of my boyfriend's also
my best friends and yeah I think she's
awesome like I said everything will be
linked below will be the first thing you
see in the description bar please go
check her out and um if you do check her
out tell her I say hello alright so
let's get started on the top five I
don't want to say I keep wanting to say
top five like it's my top 5 series no
let's get started I'm going to show you
guys the top five worst products ever
know at least you know five products
that didn't work for me basically so the
first thing I want to talk about is a
math and I have six of these yes you
heard that correctly six of these I'm
going to get them rid I'm going to get
rid of them after this video I cannot
believe I have six of these it's really
really sad I basically got these as like
100-point perks from Sephora and I don't
know why I kept getting them I just
thought oh bullsháá you know those are
amazing i should just you know keep
getting them with my points no I'm so
disappointed that I did that and wasted
600 points on these little masks I hate
it it is the bosha luminizing black mask
this is supposed to be a peel-off mask
and it sucks it's really really bad you
put a really really thick layer of this
on your face and you're supposed to let
it kind of dry and it is really really
shiny and it's like I don't know it
looks kind of cool and you're supposed
to be able to just peel it off after you
guys you cannot peel this off no matter
how much you put on no matter how little
you put on you cannot take this off
after
it will start coming off in tiny little
sections and you have to sit there and
pull at your face forever and it's
really really really annoying and I
really don't like it so this is
definitely the first product I would not
recommend and I would say I really don't
like at all let me show you guys the
consistencies you can kind of see it is
very very thick and it is black and it
just it looks very pretty on the face
because it's kind of shiny but honestly
really really crappy and the other think
of how this this is that after you get
it off you don't really notice any
difference in your skin I would think
that you know because it has like these
luminizing properties that supposed to
have glycolic acid may be a little bit
of charcoal that it would clear out your
pores this actually makes me break out
the day after I use this I get horrible
horrible breakouts on my skin so I
highly highly do not not recommend this
product at all it really really just is
not good for my skin at all I really
hate it and I guess I me they're gonna
have to give these away or just toss
them so that is the first product that
does not work for me the second product
that does not work for me or has not
worked for me is from Mac this is the
mac lip liner in whirl yes I said it you
guys the Mac lip liner in world i'm sure
people are like Oh what yes okay so this
is what the lip liner looks like I don't
know like what it is with Mac lip liners
I don't know if they all have the same
formula or what but I just swatch this
you guys can see do you see how like
there's like little bits on there like
little bits that get stuck like no
matter what this is like the most drying
lip liner I have ever used in my life
there's little tiny bits that get stuck
there yes it's a gorgeous gorgeous color
everybody talks about it kylie jenner
like uses this and everybody loves it
but honestly the formula and the texture
of this suck and i haven't had it that
long I've only had it for maybe five six
months it should not have this issue oh
where it literally just kind of balls up
and looks like crap and it looks even
worse on the lips like you put it on and
it's tugging and it's dry and it's just
absolutely horrible if you do want this
kind of color i recommend getting the
lipstick this is a matte lipstick but it
goes on a lot smoother and you just
don't have the same sort of issue
however I will say right away that the
lip
stick is definitely sorry but it's
definitely kind of darker and a
different sort of tone than the lip
liner does anybody else notice that with
Mac products that like their lip liners
and the lipsticks don't necessarily
match like I don't understand if they're
supposed to be the same color why are
they not the same color but anyway that
is the lip liner and that is the
lipstick i recommend the lipstick at the
matte formula is somewhat comfortable
it's not the most comfortable on but
it's a lot more comfortable than the lip
liner so the lip liner actually crap in
my opinion I don't know what I'm going
to do with this maybe I'll try and use
it more but honestly it's just crap I
can't even fill in you know my lip with
this without I don't know without it
looking like i'll kick you out my lips
it's absolutely disgusting so i do not
like that product alright the next
product I want to talk about is a
trickster little product this is a weird
one because I included this in a
favorites video because I was like I
like this you know it's like working for
me what not know this no longer works
for me so first of all let me just say
um this spray bottle does not work so
every time I spray it it comes out and
like weird little well now it's coming
out evenly no no it's not it comes out
in like little sports you guys can see
it's just completely like I don't know
just completely like soaks your hand or
your face whatever you're trying to do
it has an odd scent to it which I don't
find appealing whatsoever especially if
I'm spraying it on my face and I thought
that this was a good formula I got this
on sale from Sephora by the way it's the
chart miraculous maracuja makeup setting
spray sorry probably shouldn't mention
that um I just don't like this at all I
noticed that ah the first couple times I
had used it I thought it really did make
my makeup lasts all day but I realized
it was something else that was making my
makeup lasts all day it was something
else i have been using that week because
when i started using this again a
different week with different products
this live literally made my makeup come
right off my face and it wasn't just
because of the squirt bottle like i
poured a little bit of this into a
separate bottle and i would spritz my
face after and literally my makeup would
be melting off within an hour so really
really crap
I don't know if there's oils in here I
don't know what's in here but this is a
super super super crappy product yeah
your crappy anyway I don't recommend
this one I think that it is um not it's
like no longer available anymore anyway
so probably because of sacks but I
really just don't recommend picking up
this product if you do see it on sale on
the sephora.com website I know it looks
very very tempting because you do get a
large amount in here and it's like on
sale for around 20 ish dollars but it
really is not good has a weird sent the
spray bottle doesn't work very well and
it makes your makeup actually like melt
off your face not stay on longer all
right and the next thing i want to talk
about are these babies right here these
are the occ or obsessive compulsive
cosmetics lip tars I hate these haha I
really really hate these these are
absolutely horrible first of all I have
not had these very long and they're
already basically like breaking up at
the top like the oils are getting I
don't know you know you know what I mean
like they're kind of like breaking
through there you can see that like the
oils and actual color of breaking apart
so I have one in the this is a clear one
I don't know if this is supposed to be a
primer what but this one's called clear
and it says Matt on it I have the shade
femme which is a light pink color I have
the shade authentic which is a beautiful
kind of metallic II bronzy color and
then I have electric grano grandma is
this are you serious electric grandma
yeah electric grandma a really weird man
but it's the beautiful coral shades so
these just don't work for me no matter
what I do if I put them on with like a
lip um like a lip brush or if I put like
even that I know you're supposed to put
a really really small amount of these on
because they are extremely extremely as
you guys can see pigmented but you guys
these are just so uncomfortable on the
lips they're oily they're gross they
feel extremely extremely heavy no matter
how much you share them out I would
never recommend putting on that much you
really only need the smallest amount but
I just don't think they're worth it and
honestly I find that the shade selection
is a little strange a little strange I
know that they're supposed to be really
really bright kind of crazy colors but
just kind of a strange strange sort of
color scheme thing going on there I'm
not quite sure how to describe it I just
think that it's a little strange all the
colors are a little strange you can't
find one that's just kind of like
natural looking I don't know why I
haven't been able to one of this just
like oh and everyday sort of color
they're all very very bright and kind of
like this but anyway they're tacky
they're sticky I find them extremely
extremely gross I don't even know what
to do with this one which is the clear
one I'm not even quite sure they come
with like instructions and everything
but I just can't work with them i don't
like them so i'll probably be passing
those along but i did want to give you
guys an option if you do like full-on
opaque color like the occ lip tars on
these forever 21 ultra pigmented lip
colors are very very similar I think
they come in a better shade range you
can get pretty colors like this instead
of getting really really obnoxious
bright colors like that which sometimes
I don't know like I don't want to wear
that during the wintertime it's just too
it's too out there do you know what I
mean but you can get really really
gorgeous colors these are way way way
cheaper I think the occ lip tars are
around what twenty-five twenty-six
dollars these are like five dollars on
the forever 21 website they are just as
pigmented and much much much more
comfortable to wear so i highly
recommend checking those out alright so
that was let's see here one two three
four that was my fourth product now we
are moving on to the last product i did
a declutter video recently and i had
this in there I don't know why I didn't
declutter this because I'm very very
disappointed in this palette I love Too
Faced if you guys have been watching my
TMO for a while you know to face is my
favorite brand ever i love it i love
love love them but I don't love
everything that they come out with I'm
just being honest it's just how it is
this is they're two faced natural face
natural radiance face palette it looks
like this a very very pretty little box
cardboard thing and in here you get a
bronzer you get a cream blush you get a
um powder blush you get a concealer you
get a illuminator and then some kind of
a base so the only reason I think that I
held on to this when i did my declutter
series is because i love this blush
right here this one right here it is
absolutely stunning it's a beautiful
kind of mauve color with tons in
tons of gorgeous gorgeous like peachy
shimmer in it it's just absolutely
stunning it's got this beautiful
metallic thing going on I think it's
just gorgeous like a rose gold sort of
thing so what I'm going to do is just be
pot that because that is the only thing
that I like in this palette the rest is
all very very disappointing this bronzer
right here is very very orange and it's
a very very rough to the touch I mean it
feels like cardboard like absolute
cardboard and when you swatch it you
barely get anything I mean it's just not
not an attractive bronzer whatsoever the
cream blush is pretty um I think you
know maybe i will teapot that one as
well it does come off quite pigmented
and I do think it's pretty to top with
the um you know powder blush but this
thing over here this conceal thing I
don't know it's just like hard as a rock
like not creamy and nice this little
highlight thing is extremely oily and
then you get this little I don't even
know what this is down there you know
just kind of weird textures um and it
smells absolutely horrible I can't even
explain how horrible horrible it smells
you guys I don't know if it's gone bad
I'm not quite sure i'm not i really
don't know why I held on to this but
anyway there's some of them kind of
swatched but really the only thing in
here that I like our probably the
blushes I'm not quite sure if all de
pots the cream blush but definitely this
blush here but this stuff is just not
worth it I don't think it's worth it to
hold on to this I will probably um de
pop those two and then give the rest
away or just toss them because they
really really are crafty this just has
to wash texture to it ever I just can't
believe it so anyway as much as I love
to face this was a very very
disappointing I obviously would not
repurchase and yeah so let me see here 1
2 3 4 5 those are my five products i
hope you guys enjoyed this video let me
know if you guys do like these kind of
videos i am a quite opinionated when it
comes to products i don't like but i
don't always like to talk about them
because they don't know if you guys like
to hear about these kind of things but
let me know if you do because I of
course do run across products that I do
not like in my collection and of course
i did my declutter series which really
helped me kind of purge and clean up
like clean out a lot of products that i
don't want or didn't like any more but
there's
a lot of things that I come across
whether it be lip products skin care
hair care stuff like that so I can
definitely do these videos more often if
you guys would like but anyway I just
want to say thank you so much Meg for
collabing with me um it is like a dream
come true I literally wash every single
one of your videos I really really
highly recommend you guys going over and
checking out her channel and subscribing
to her she's so real and honest and
awesome I think you're gonna love her so
anyway I do hope you guys enjoyed this
video thank you so much for watching and
I'll see you my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
