Channel today we're going to be
discussing five Sephora sold skin care
brands that you may think are cruelty
free but unfortunately they do tests on
animals so let's go ahead and start with
the fresh brands so the fresh brand is
very well known for their Lotus youth
preserved line as well as their aged
delay black tea line they also are very
very well known up for their sugar lip
treatments now they seem like a brand
that would have really good ethics and
would not test on animals but
unfortunately they do I do not know this
until I actually went into Sephora and
was talking to one of their
representatives and she told me we are
not cruelty free alright the next brand
I want to talk about is origins this one
I always really shocks me they're very
well known for their ginseng line like
they're refreshing eye cream as well as
their energy boosting moisturizer
they have some other really fantastic
products as well and this is even what
Origen says themselves on at the
sephora.com website the moment you
unveil an origins product you
encountered nature in one of its purest
forms from the first essential to the
radiance finish the brands mission is to
deliver creative luxury skincare
solutions that are powered by nature so
when a brand really talks about using
ingredients that you can find in nature
and having really really herbal based
products and just natural ingredients in
general you would think that they would
have tests on animals but like I said
unfortunately origins does test on
animals next we have OSHA OSHA was
really disappointing what I found all
the zoos I was very disappointed because
Boccia is great if you do have more
combination to oily skin they are a
skincare brand that is really reasonably
priced as well when it does come to
Sephora they're very well known for
their luminizing black mass 30 toxifying
black cleanser their makeup breakup cool
cleansing oil which I used to be
obsessed with and also there is this new
charcoal jelly ball cleanser which only
retails for $20 which I've heard is
really fantastic so they were really a
good option if you did have more
combination to oily skin and when I
found out that they do tests on animals
I was so disappointed I did hear that
they are starting to kind of work on
going the cruelty-free which would be
awesome so I'll keep you guys updated
but as of right now Bo sure does test on
animals
alright the next one we have here is
Peter Thomas Roth you guys know this
what really hurt me so I love the Peter
Thomas Roth face map I love the Irish
more mud I love
enzyme dermal resurfacer I love the rose
stem cell bio repair gel math I mean
these are maths that I have been using
for a years so when I found out they do
tests on animals I was incredibly
disappointed I also really liked their
max correction tabs which are great if
you do have more fine lines and wrinkles
that you want to kind of clear up as
well as like breakouts congested skin
and of course their Peter Thomas Roth on
wrinkled fields as you guys know have
been a solid like skin care item in my
collection for years now so I'm
currently going through my last level
set but yeah unfortunately Peter Thomas
Roth does tests on animals it's so
unfortunate because they really do have
good skin care that works very very well
but yes they do tests and finally guys I
want to talk about the lam glow so a lot
of people tell me like lens low seems
like a brand that would test on animals
but for me they never really did I used
to own a full size of every single one
of their maps as well as every single
one of their cleansers I was a big a
buyer of glam glow I do believe that
their products work I believe that their
masks work incredibly well but when I
found out that they were cruelty free I
had to start looking for different
options so now I want to walk you guys
through some brands so4 that you not
test on animals that will give you just
as good of products as far as skin care
is concerned the first one I want to
talk about is Sunday Reilly Sunday
Reilly is very very pricey but let me
tell you their stuff really is worth it
they're all in one of lactic acid
treatment as well as their luna sleeping
night oil are absolutely fantastic I
also would highly recommend their UFO
ultra clarifying a face oil if you do
have a little more oily or combination
skin and for basically any sort of skin
type I would highly recommend the title
brightening enzyme a water cream they
really have products that really do work
similar to Peter Thomas Roth also the
drunk elephant line is very very popular
currently they have their see from add a
serum they have the friend boost
glycolic night serum they have their
Sakaki baby facial their intensive
hydration gel a lot of products that are
very very highly rated at Sephora and
brands are just products in general that
seem to do a lot for your skin so I
haven't tried as much from drunk
elephant but I will say I do enjoy the
intensive hydration gel and I have
recently tried out their upward tint
which is basically like a tinted
sunscreen which I'm really enjoying as
well so that's another brand you can
look into next we do have the Josie
Maran line
if you have incredibly dry skin and you
want something very very natural all
vegan products as well as cruelty-free
products josie maran is a very very good
option she has like out just everything
is based with argan oil so if you need a
lot of hydration I think it's a great
brand to look at currently I have the
pure argan milk intensive hydrating
treatment on my Sephora lovelace I also
do have the intensive creamy oil she has
some awesome products and like I said if
you have more dry skin I think you would
really enjoy that brand the next brand I
want to talk about that is cruelty free
which I think a lot of people don't know
is Coral Sea free is Korres Korres does
have some really amazing amazing skin
care products recently I really got into
their goals in crocus ageless saffron
elixir serum it really gives a beautiful
beautiful amount of Sheen to your skin
it's very healthy on the skin it feels
amazing and it does kind of smell like
saffron which is really cool they also
do have a whole line dedicated that it's
like a pomegranate and grape fruit
infusion line which is dedicated to
those of you who do have combination
skin so yes I would definitely look into
Korres if you are looking for really
nice moisturizers as well as serums and
finally the left brand I want to
recommend is only Henrickson so a lot of
people seem to think only Henderson does
tests on animals they do not they have
some excellent skin care products as
well one of my favorite items is the
truth serum I've been buying that for
years now it is one of my all-time
favorite serums it's great if you want
to brighten up your skin if you have
extra you know like hyperpigmentation
left on your skin after breakouts things
like that it's absolutely fantastic they
also have their three little wonders kit
which just have their let's see here I
think it has their invigorating night
treatment as well as the serum and then
also the nurture me cream I believe so
they have all sorts of different lines
that you can choose from the orange one
is great if you want brightening at the
green line is great if you are more oily
or combination skin and then the purple
one is great for anti-aging so anyway
guys those are some brands at Sephora as
far as skin care is concerned that test
on the animals and also some that do not
I hope you guys found this video
enjoyable and I hope that it was helpful
for you guys thank you so much for
joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow
