channel today's video is going to be all
about five different unique beauty
products and that I would like to try
out so this is basically a beauty
wishlist I've done wishlist videos
before for Sephora you know I'm like my
Sephora loveless I've talked about
products I want to pick up from Ulta but
this is going to go into a playlist of
makeup that fascinates me or products
that fascinate me because lately I've
been noticing a lot of indie brands
releasing stuff that I'm super
interested in cap on vie recently
released some perfumes I'm going to talk
about in this video that I'm very
interested in so I thought this would be
a lot of fun this way I can talk to you
guys about what you would like me to
pick up so I can also review it but also
I want to know if you guys have tried
any of these products out if you like
them let me know if you don't like them
please let me know as well so the first
product I want to talk about is from
story of book cosmetics so they are
actually a debrand they are cruelty free
and I found them on Instagram they do a
lot of really cool brushes they will be
coming out with a hunger games
collection this summer which is awesome
but this is what intrigues me the most
this is called the wizardry and
witchcraft eyeshadow palette so it's got
really really beautiful packaging as you
guys can see but on the inside those
eyeshadows are totally speaking to me I
know they look a little bland but I am
someone who loves absolutely loves cool
town eyes shadows and honestly lately
I've been noticing so many brands doing
the same a warm tone theme over and over
and over again as someone who holds a
strong cool undertone and someone who
really loves cool eye shadows and this
is really speaking to me and that is
definitely the first product that I
definitely want to pick up so we shall
see I would love to know your thoughts
down below next I have the cap on vsync
in center perfume so and these are
rather new and I just really want those
because first of all the packaging is
impeccable it is cast artwork which i
think is gorgeous the artistry that went
into this is beautiful and also I really
like this sheet release / qø but I
wasn't a huge fan of that naked skin
perfume that urban decay recently
released I thought it kind of smells
like lemongrass and like sage or
something which is a nice scent but I
just expected something a little more
perfume me but I feel like these are
going to be good I read a lot of reviews
on the Sephora comm website
apparently years ago she used to have
this stage perfume and I guess it
smelled really good now I believe the
formula has changed a little bit but
these are cruelty free perfume
are very very hard to find to not try
harder to find so anyway these things
for you miss wants to be floral based
and then these thinner perfume in the
black bottle which looks freakin
stunning it is supposed to be more of
like a spicy cologne sort of scent
similar to YSL's of black opium which
I've gone through three full sizes of
that is a beautiful musky kind of sexy
scent so I'm really excited about those
and I think I need to pick a both of
them up alright next we have the melt
cosmetics stacking a sort of eye shadow
so these are actually magnetic and they
stack on top of each other these are not
new releases they have been out forever
but they have like the gunmetal stack
they have the radioactive stack they
have the dark matter they have the rough
stack and I hear such good things about
these so I want to go ahead and purchase
one of them let me know down below which
color selection you think I should pick
I'm really kind of aiming towards like
this gunmetal because I love those cool
tones but if there is a particular one
that you guys would like to see be
review and honestly really attracted to
all of the shades that I saw so they're
very excited about those I've heard they
are great quality very creamy very
pigmented and I will be starting a video
series soon all about indie brands and
trying out indie makeup and has a lot of
you I've been telling you lately I need
to go ahead and do that since I'm moving
in the cruelty-free direction so yeah
those are the next product that really
really intrigues me next we have the
Urban Decay a Velvet Iser so I was
really not too interested in this
product until I stopped hotties revealed
now I want to be really quickly a lot of
people were wondering why I didn't
mention Tati in yesterday's video I'm no
longer subscribed to toffee it has
nothing to do with any sort of drama
that she has inserted herself into or
any drama around her I have nothing
subscribed for about six to eight months
I'm just not really a fan of like the oh
my god and what the series that's
just my opinion if you love those series
that's fantastic but yeah no longer
subscribe to her but I do to run across
this video and you looked amazing on her
skin so this is actually like a mixing
medium that you can go ahead and add
into your liquid foundation so you mix
the two together and then you wear it on
your favor supposed to be really good if
you are a little more like oily or
problematic skin and now I'm definitely
more normal skin now that I'm living
here in Arizona but I still really want
to try this house it looks beautiful on
her skin like the finish with gorgeous
you can also use this as a
powder or you can apply this powder
before you go in with your foundation to
really really help with oil control so
that's definitely something I'm
interested in it's a very unique and
interesting product so I would love to
know if you guys have tried that out and
finally we have a product here from
Stila that I really haven't heard good
things about it is the poreless priming
putty I think it's called the Papa I
hate that name is literally the worst
day ever but I have seen a lot of people
do first impressions on this and the
people that I watch do have more like
combo to oily skin it seems like this is
really not that great of like a balm
sort of foundation it's supposed to go
from cream to powder but the reason why
I wanted to try it out was because I saw
someone with dry skin review it and I
saw someone with normal skin review and
they both really really liked it I feel
like it's kind of like a blurring sort
of foundation with very very light
coverage it is very interesting it does
sort of have that putty consistency to
it when I watched the first impressions
I can see people are really kind of
sticking their fingers in there like
it's kind of squishy I don't know what
it is it really just intrigues me I
heard the packaging is that great the
poop that it comes with isn't that great
but I think I will go ahead and try it
out from Sephora so that if I don't like
it I can go ahead and return it but that
is something that I've had my eye on for
a very long time that's been in my
Sephora loveless and I just really feel
like I need to try it out for myself
especially and now that my skin is
changing so anyway guys those are five
unique a beauty products I would like to
try out like I said I want to know your
thoughts down below also let me know if
you have found any interesting or unique
items that you would like to try out and
I guess I will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
