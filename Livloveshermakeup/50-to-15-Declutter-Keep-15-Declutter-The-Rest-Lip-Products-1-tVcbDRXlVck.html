today we are finally getting started on
this damn lip declutter that I've been
putting off
okay there's already an item there I've
been putting this off because it has the
killing my back to film these yes you
got I don't know what it is there's
something so painful about filming
declutter videos like I don't I don't
know it sounds like a first-world
problem but like bending over and
leaning over the product so today I'm
right here it's obviously not the cutest
background but I am standing so
hopefully this will be good I am so
ready to declutter my lip products I'm
done like I have way too many so today
I'm gonna make it real easy on myself I
am only gonna keep 15 out of a pile of I
don't know how many I have here but I
will list down below so we will be doing
quite a few of these videos there's all
sorts of different lipsticks I don't
know our third lip glosses and I already
did lip glosses if you don't know I
decluttered 88 lip glosses I already do
cluttered at my liquid lipsticks so now
we just have like tints and balms and
lipsticks so just go ahead and get
started if the first item that I have
here is from Maybelline this is part of
their bold line this was such a fail it
is a lipstick in like a sapphire shade
this did not work for me it was very
very streaky I did not like it so I'm
gonna let it go
yes I have been swatching alright next I
have this a Melissa Autry this is called
the vamp lipstick this was part of her
collection I'm gonna go ahead and let
that go as well I have the Stila
afterglow lip
what is this lip pencil it's like a
really hot pink shade as you guys can
see but it is so so so incredibly matte
on the lips it looks really bad on my
lips so I'm gonna go ahead and let that
go next we have the lorac 20th
anniversary lipstick in the shade which
is a really pretty kind of like peachy
color let me go ahead and swatch it for
you guys you can see actually it's not
peachy at all see I don't even know what
this color is like whose because I
probably haven't never even worn it but
that's what it looks like I don't need
it I have so many colors like that in my
collection so I'm gonna let that go but
we have the revlon berry smoothie lip
butter this is beautiful but i'm gonna
let it go next we have this little sugar
petal
what is this lip balm from fresh I'm
gonna go ahead and let that ghetto I
have double sets of those and one of the
sets that did go bad you can tell right
away by the scent because the normally
smell like lemon but my second scent
actually smells okay so I'm gonna
declutter those probably to my friend
Rochelle here is a Revlon lip butter in
the shade a juicy papaya I don't know
why I ever bought this
so not my color so I'm gonna go ahead
and I'll let that go as well
lorac ultra eco lipstick again this is
the 20th anniversary collection the
shade is called celebrity huh I really
want to keep this I really want to I'm
gonna do it there's gonna be one of my
15 all right the next item I have here
is the posy balm this is from a benefit
I love these kind of bombs that they
have is one of my favorite like balm
formulations so I will be keeping that I
also am going to keep Venna balm which
looks like this and I think you guys can
guess I am also keeping lolly balm of
course and chacha balm so I really do
like these I like these way more than
the fresh sugar lip treatments because
they do not rub off on my cute head
joint the fresh ones actually have a
waxy residue to them that bothers me
alright next I have a tart romantic lip
surgence lip crayon a really really nice
warm toned peachy color but I don't need
it so I'm gonna go ahead and let that go
I also have just bare minerals what is
this it is like a tinted lip balm in the
shade honey I don't think I've ever used
it so I don't need to I'm gonna let it
go I have two of the Revlon kissable
balm stains the names have worn off
that's how old they are so I am going to
go ahead and let these go I will
definitely take a sniff at them all of
you to color makeup I'm gonna smell
first to make sure I haven't gone bad if
it's gone bad then I toss it all right
here is a wet and wild matte lipstick
and you shade it cherry picking I never
reach for this it's too drying on my
lips so I'm gonna let that go I have
another tert on what is this wonder lip
surgence didn't I just talk about one of
these my goodness I've - alright well it
is a really peachy color as you guys can
see I'm pretty sure I have two of those
I don't know why but I do I'm gonna let
go that's here is a little Dior lipstick
it's adorable packaging but I don't
recall ever using this and I don't
really have any desire to it's just a
like straight-up warm toned pink shade
not really my kind of color so I'm gonna
let it go
here is a Korres um what is this call
twist lipstick in raspberry what is this
it's like I've never used this it feels
really waxy I don't like it I'm gonna
let it go I swear you guys there are
products I have never even reached for
in my collection
all right here is hot shots from the
lorac 20th anniversary collection I'm
gonna go ahead and let that go it's just
a beautiful beautiful bright pink color
but I have so many like that
let's see here we have a forever 21
lipstick right here this is really
pretty it's like a matte pink I'm going
to go ahead and let that go as well
here is a pop pouty pop cran this is in
Rose romance and I recall liking this
let me go ahead and still watch it
whoops
nope I thought it was a little more cool
tone it's very warm tone I think I've
only worn that once gonna let that go
it's the sad truth guys here is the
sugar in Rose I gonna let that go here
is a wet and wild matte lip crayon in
the shade chart a cherry way way way to
dry I'm gonna let that go I have some of
the maybelline color whispers here that
I do enjoy but I feel like I like the
Revlon lip butters a little more and I
have a color whisper that I want to keep
instead of these I think I don't know
I'm looking at the pile and I'm like
frantically like what do I want to keep
this one right here is called a pin-up
peach it's just a beautiful beautiful
I'm sorry this one is called pink
possibilities oh it's gone bad you guys
see that
yeah but when I starts to get a little
bit of a film towards the top it's
discolored that is a sign that it's gone
bad so we're gonna toss that here we do
have the shade pin-up peach so that one
was pink possibilities this one appears
to be okay there is pinup peach gonna go
ahead and let that go I will be doing a
video soon on how you can tell when your
makeup has gone bad it's pretty obvious
but you know some people I think need
that extra kick in the butt so this is
mocha again a shade that I would never
personally reach for and oh no it's not
bad it's just it's just a weird shade I
don't think I've ever used that so I'm
gonna let it go next we have the matte
lipstick in the shade well I bought this
because everybody was talking about it
and I hated it it's super super matte
and drying on the lips so I'm gonna go
ahead and let that go I'm also gonna let
go of this Maybelline lipstick right
here in the shade deepest cherry it's
not a very deep cherry color at all when
you actually get it like swatched it
really is just kind of weird I don't
know it looks like a like a rum raisin
kind of shade I don't like it I don't
like it alright next we have the revlon
colorburst matte lip balm in the shade
unapologetic and I love this I'm
obsessed with it I will be keeping it
look at that color
look at that color yes that is going to
be one two three four five my sixth
product my seventh will probably be this
so I'm going to keep one of these little
guys this is the sugar
from fresh so Abby honey color let me
show you guys oh my god do these oh I
forgot how these I forgot how these even
open that's how long it's been but it's
a beautiful beautiful new tea color I do
still want to keep one of them and I do
have some in full-size that I'll be
declaring as well so I'm going to keep
that one but I will declutter let's see
here passion and also the shade cherry
and also this little one right here
what is that shade this one is called
tulip and I declare that's some more of
the lorac twentieth anniversary in
lipsticks weave dominatrix which is very
similar to Urban Decay shame and I want
to keep that one so I'm gonna declutter
that and then this one is free spirit
but I really like the shade beauty guru
that they have it's just such a funny
name but I think I'll keep beauty guru
and then I will let go of this one
beauty gurus in the other pile of you
know lip products so we won't get to
that one today next we have this Doutzen
Kroes this is a lipstick from l'oreal
yes mr. banner yeah do you want to say
hi do you want to say hi there use
tell him you're being a bad boy he's
nibbling at mommy's toes why I tell us
I'm trying to declutter anyway this is
the Doutzen Kroes this is from the
l'oreal like nude lipstick line is a
horrible horrible color on probably
everybody so I'm gonna go ahead and let
that go I mean it might look good on
somebody that's not as so maybe it looks
really bad on me and it looks really bad
on my mom and actually it looks bad on
my friend Senora who has a very very
deep complexion so nobody wanted it
that's why I say wouldn't look good on
anyone right here we have devotion this
is a Revlon lip crayon aleko of that I'm
also gonna let go of two more of these
Melissa Autry lipsticks I don't know why
I have so many of these I think it was
because I was on her subscription
service and this particular shade is
called supreme which is pretty but I
don't really reach for those purpley
Pink's this one right here is called
Rosie stone which is kind of similar to
Mac swirl but it's very very drying just
as much as the mackerel so I'm not gonna
keep that one let's see here a
maybelline color whisper in the shade

love this shade it is so so so beautiful
