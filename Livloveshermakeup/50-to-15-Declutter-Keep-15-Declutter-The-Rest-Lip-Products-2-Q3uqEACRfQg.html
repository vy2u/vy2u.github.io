you don't mind me posting these videos
back-to-back I'm just kind of on a roll
here so yeah let's go ahead and jump
right into it I have another 50 lip
products in front of me and I'm going to
weed myself down to 15 so the first one
I have here is the Lancome juicy shaker
in the shade a cherry Symphony I'm going
to let that go this is the wet and wild
what is this juicy lip balm with SPF 15
in the strawberry scent these are really
good but I like the raspberry one more
so I will declutter this one alright I
have two of the Too Faced sweet peach
lip gloss oils right here so these are
both really really beautiful I love this
formulation so I will be going ahead and
keeping both of them this one is peach
tease and this is Papa don't peach
alright we have some sort of a lip stain
here from pop beauty it says stain stray
in peach pucker I don't know if I've
ever ever used this I'm just gonna go
ahead let go all right here we have a
L'Oreal this is one of those like liquid
kind of lipstick things if that makes
sense so you have the color on one side
and then the balm on the other the shade
is called azalea which is kind of funny
because I feel like as Elyas are super
super bright pink and this is like a
muted pink but yeah I never use this so
I'm gonna let it go here I have a what
is this I think this is a matte lipstick
from the balm cosmetics in the shade my
bills be paid that is so funny so that
is the shade it is really really
beautiful but I I've never even used it
and I'm just gonna let it go okay it is
what it is alright I do have a matte
lipstick here this is from Maybelline
right yeah Maybelline and this isn't a
ravishing Rose I do like their matte
formulation but I do not reach for this
color often enough so I'm gonna let that
go let's see here I have a Too Faced la
creme lipstick in the shade Vampira it's
so gorgeous by the way yes I know my
hands look all messed up I have a little
bit of lupus rashes and of course just
leftover swatches that are stained but
yeah I'm going to go ahead and keep that
that would be my third one here we have
two of the Revlon these are the color
drop lipsticks I really love these I
remember when Emily Noelle 83 was
talking about these I know they're
called the moon drop so this particular
shade is called crystal cut coral it is
so beautiful I'm going to keep that and
then this one right here is called 710
Orange flip I'm going to go
and let go of this one alright so moving
on I have a Maybelline vivid right here
in the shade verizon berry which is
really beautiful it has a bright purple
but I don't reach for it often enough so
I'm gonna go ahead and let that go let's
see we have the fairest nude this is
from L'Oreal never got into it honestly
never really wore it on my lips I know
everybody loves it but you know what
it's okay it wasn't for everyone I guess
so I'm just gonna go ahead and let that
go you guys know I love the Revlon
lipsticks but this one isn't a matte
finish and I do find it to be slightly
drying so I'm gonna let it go it is
called royally red and it has a mass
like I said alright here we have another
Revlon Super Lustrous
in the shade mink which is gorgeous you
guys see this color I love this but
there is another one that I like even
more so I'm gonna go how to look this
one go this one right here is called
choco delicious also very beautiful but
I kept my Lime Crime Salem liquid
lipstick so I'm gonna go ahead and let
go of this one because they are the same
sort of color this is one of the Kate
Moss lipsticks never got into it it just
looks like that really really everyday
sort of friendly mauve color but I have
so many of these colors so I don't need
that I have some lip stains here from
NYC I am just gonna go ahead and
declutter all three of these we have
kind of like a berry shade a peachy
shade and then more of like a your low
spot that'll shade here we have a pop
Beauty another stain a stray this one is
in poppy pink I'm also gonna declutter
that this is a little YSL is this the
full of tintin oil I think it's a little
up tintin oil sample I already have full
sizes so I'm gonna let that go here is
the Sephora lip gloss I came in like
some sort of us before a play box
haven't even opened it don't need it
gonna go ahead and let go alright this
is where it gets tricky we have some lip
liners here so what do I want to keep
all right I definitely want to keep the
Urban Decay 24/7 what is this the ozone
and this is basically just like a clear
lip liner I think this is a smart idea
to keep so I will keep that as my fifth
item I'm gonna let go of the Mac world
lip liner this was extremely extremely
drying so I'm gonna let that go I'm
gonna let go of this one right here
which is the beauty for real I've never
even opened this that's what it looks
like just kind of like Macworld I don't
know I would rather just have a clear
lip liner so I'm gonna go ahead and let
go of that
and then here is another one of those
wet-and-wild Velvet Matte lip colors
these are really really drying on the
lips so I'm gonna go ahead and let go of
that we have a NYX lip liner these are
quite good but I never use lip liners I
feel like the only one I truly need is
probably the charlotte tilbury pillow
talk and then the ozone alright here is
the wet and wild this is the juicy lip
balm in cherry and I don't know guys
I think I'm gonna keep this yeah it
smells so good I can't like I have to
I'm gonna go ahead and keep this
alright the next item we have here is a
little Tarte lip what is this oh is it a
lipstick I haven't even tried yet I'm
not gonna try I'm just gonna go ahead
and declutter that it's a very pretty
color I'm guessing it's from the
rainforest of the sea collection the
shade is called let's see your beach bum
it's pretty but a lot of colors like it
I don't need it all right Urban Decay's
shame this was the old revolution
formula love this I have to have this so
let me swatch it for you guys because
this color is everything look at that
look at that oh it's so beautiful yes so
yes I will be going ahead and keeping
that alright let's see here I have a
Maybelline vivid in the shade at Pinkpop
this is a super super like cool toned
pink shade and I don't reach for those
all that often so I'm gonna go ahead and
let go of this one but we have another a
Revlon
in the shade black cherry again very
similar to it see Super Lustrous in a
crumb formulation by the way very very
similar to shame so I'm gonna go ahead
and let go of that here we have a stain
that this is the super state Maybelline
Tenace stain and gloss I used to love
these but I'm gonna let it go I just
haven't been reaching for them lately so
the sheet is called grape or violet
great violence I don't know it's
something like that
alright here's an Anasazi of Beverly
Hills lip gloss in the shade fudge mmm
yes I'm gonna keep this
I do like alright here we have a fuchsia
fusion from Revlon this is another matte
formulation so I know it's a creme oh I
don't know let me swatch it oh god why
does it have to be so pretty where's I
have to be so pretty okay I'm gonna have
to keep it so yes I will be keeping that
let me count up here one two three four
five six seven eight nine okay I'm doing
pretty well let's see here we do have a
Jordana lip liner that
sorry the Milani color statement
lipliner like I said I feel like I
really only need a zone and Charlotte
Tilbury spill okok so I'm gonna let go
of that as well as this NYX one it right
here in peony oh my gosh even though
peonies are my favorite flower
alright this is the elf lip stain so we
have the stain on one side and then the
gloss on the other I just thought the
color was so pretty but I've never used
it and I probably never will because I'm
going to go ahead and declutter ed we
have a Baby Lips here this is again in
that like neon sort of formulation I am
going to keep this one it is one of the
orange shades I just love the baby lips
all right this is the elf lip glow so I
love this just as much as there's gonna
say quoi and I want both of them so yes
I am going to go ahead and keep this if
you wanted do further is gonna say quoi
go ahead and pick this up for yourself
alright let's see here I already showed
that one didn't I yeah there's two of
those okay the two Baby Lips have to go

beautiful shade I think it's called
whimsical but I never wear it but do I
wear it let me put it let me swatch it

sheer look at that swatch yes girl it's
a little on the sheer side not really my
my style so I will go ahead and discover

to keep this I tried it once and I liked
it so I mean you know I feel like that

ahead and keep that I think I got that
in a glossy box let's see here yeah
let's see here a Jordana easy liner for
the lips in baby blossom I don't
that's gonna declare facts another Allah
Rock what is this another 20th
anniversary this particular shade is
called mu a it looks so similar to
dominatrix but this one is like
straight-up black so I'm gonna go ahead
and do cutter that I do not look good in
that color maybe for how we are
something but I don't need to keep a lip
product around for Halloween all right
