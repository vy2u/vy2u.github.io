declutter video for you guys today so
let's just jump right into it this is
going to be another lip product
declutter I get two of these yesterday
I'm calling it 5215 so I am starting
with 50 different lip products in front
of me and then hopefully I will make my
way down to the 15 that I want to keep
in my collection and then the other ones
I will be clutter so the first item I
want to talk about is this little guy
right here I was just walking this
off-camera there is the swatch if you're
curious I cannot decide if I want to
keep this I think I'm going to let it go
it is the base beauty let's see here
creme lip gloss in the shade gold
honestly this is so incredibly opaque I
cannot get this to work so yeah I'm
going to go ahead and let that go the
next item we have your is the elf
conditioning lip balm and this
particular one is in a melon shade is
called mellow melon and I'm going to go
ahead and declutter this one I really
like the blissful berry shade so that's
going to be one that I see I do have
another one here in the shade romantic
Rouge this one's also really really
pretty but like I said I do prefer the
blissful fairy so I will be decluttering
both of those I have a lipstick here I
believe I got this any glossy box
probably about I don't know maybe five
months ago it's a really really gorgeous
gorgeous shade as you guys can see has a
little bit of like a lavender iridescent
running through it but I have only
watched it and I did notice that it
wasn't super super pigmented and it did
it kind of leaves like a dryness on my
hand so I'm going to declutter that next
we have the all maiya lip butter this is
the pink light medium number sixty this
is really really comfortable and
beautiful on the lips but I am going to
go ahead and declutter it just because I
feel like the shade is so incredibly
basic alright the next item I have here
is my wife Salva love change in oil in
the shade peach me love I will
definitely be going ahead and coming on
to that I also will be holding onto my
clearance instant like comfort lip oil B
shade that I have right here is called
0-2 raspberry I adore this I will be
keeping that I have a Revlon lip butter
right here in your shade pink truffle I
think I have two or three of these I'm
going to eye and let go of this I'm
going to declutter it I do like the
shade but I just feel like I have so
many in my collection that looked like
that let's see here I have a little mini
amuse-bouche
let's take here from buy beauty is the
part in this particular shade is called
pepper I'm going to go ahead and
declutter this because I do have the
dual ended lipstick in pepper and cafe
all right speaking of by Bowie I have a
some a little guys right here these are
basically the retractable lip pencils
that they had at last year so I want to
keep a few of these this particular
shade right here which is called
pomegranate is really really gorgeous
that as you guys can see that so I'm
going to keep this one let me show you
guys what it looks like
look at that shade so yeah this one on
sorry this one called cool a so that is
a really nice kind of rosy like a
reddish color and then I do also want to
keep Andy shade it will see here cafe
don't want to keep cafe I don't know so
here is cafe it's more of like a nudey
pink color I already have this in the
double-ended lipstick form that I really
really like it you know what I think
I'll go ahead and let go of cafe and
then I have a burr gene which is just a
beautiful beautiful kind of purply color
as you guys can see like an eggplant I'm
going to go ahead and let that go and
then also I am going to let go of this
shade right here which I believe is
torque so torque is a little more cool
tones you know what maybe I'll hold on
to this one I'll hold on to tour sport
is really really pretty
I feel like it's right on my alley your
looks better kind of color alright so
I'm going to keep that one moving on we
have the low a tint from a benefit I'm
going to go ahead and if you color that
we have a Maybelline vivid lipstick in
the shade that we'll see here on fire
red this is a beautiful beautiful red
lipstick but I already have a few that I
am going to be holding onto in my
collection so I don't need that I do
have two of these L'Oreal color riche
bombs these are quite comfortable but
not like the most comfortable lip balm
ever so I'm going to go ahead and
declutter both of them this one is 219
plush plum and then this one right here
is called heavenly berry so imma go
ahead and cover those just a Maybelline
peach Baby Lips I am going to go ahead
and declutter I honestly never ever
reach for this particular color so you
know declutter that I am going to keep
this little elf
what is this tinted lip balm right here
this particular shade is called very
sweet I really like these they are very
very very pigmented and this is like a
true kind of like purpley color as you
guys can see so I will be holding on to
that or should I close on to this one or
your guys I want to hold on to one of
them so either xoxo
or that one you know what I'll do XOXO
red and then i will declutter this one
alright next we have this little
lipstick here super super cute packaging
this is from trifle cosmetics and this
is what the lipstick looks like it's
beautiful but um a little too warm tone
for me so I'm going to go ahead and
cutter that next we have trouble by a
Melissa Autry again this was from her
subscription service and nice dark brown
shade I am going to go ahead and you can
letter that this is a little Marc Jacobs
mini vib Rouge lipstick that you got
last year I didn't really get into it so
I'm going to go ahead and declutter that
as well I do have this little lip balm
here which I love it's like a change in
lip balm but not a tinted lip balm
asleep I think we're going to open it
hold on oh I just so difficult there
it's kind of like a tinted lip balm
because a little bit of color I heard
about this from Samantha Sherman like
two years ago on YouTube and it is
really really beautiful I like to pair
this together with my genifique wha from
a cosmetic so I will be going ahead and
holding on to that I do have two filled
with places here and they got stuck in
this part of the collection or I doubt
this part of the declutter I should say
I did already declutter all of my filled
lip places I had like 23 of them but
this one is chicken and this one is
called a plastic strawberry banana so
I'm going to declutter both of those I
do not like that formulation next we
have another bio cell the left changing
oil in the shade of crush me orange I
will be sleeping back and I will be
keeping feed me love all right here we
have a lorac twentieth anniversary this
is a lipstick one of the highly
pigmented lipsticks and this particular
shade is called party girl and it is
just a nice kind of medium tone pink and
I think I will go ahead and I will hold
on class alright next we have a baby
lips here this is a really really old
baby look so I'm just going to go ahead
and top it because I already know that
it is probably done and then this guy
right here this is another baby lips
this is being it like the grape scent or
like the grape flavor I am going to go
ahead and keep that because I love it
here we have a Revlon what is this Pearl
Super Lustrous
and lipstick and this is indie shade
mochi rose so this was the one that I
was telling you guys about that is so so
so gorgeous
I just love the weight of this book so
there it is watched as you guys can see
so I will definitely be keeping that let
me
here one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten eleven

urban decay this is the math revolution
of the old school revolution lipstick
this is in D shade in nineteen and
ninety three now I do not need to keep
this because I do have this particular
shade and B new a black male vice
lipstick palette so I'm going to go
ahead and declutter that I have a little
what is this Rudy or this is like a
little a little lipstick sample from
Dior I guess I'm guessing I was like a
100-point person's before or something
let me see the color oh it's just like a
true red yeah I'm not going to hold on
to that so I will go ahead and declutter

going to be my fourteenth and fifteenth
item they are so so so good you guys

here grey over it this will probably the
best color out of all of them that I
picked up I did pick up a white shade I
picked up a so let's see here a really
really nice with sapphire shade and then
this one and I feel like this one had it
the best sort of formula to it and here
we have a wild Mandarin and this is
another one from the brights collection
I'm sorry from the vivid and you guys
can probably see if this has multiplied
so we're going to go ahead and drop that

lipstick and honestly I'm just not
really into the color anymore so I am
going to go ahead and declutter that I

like a tinted lip balm but it was very
very very tinted can you guys see that
