my channel today I am doing a video that
I really did not plan to film I was
originally supposed to do at the prism
eyeshadow palette review swatches and
comparison for you guys today I feel
like when it comes to reviews I
definitely want to toss those up or
right away because they are a little
more time-sensitive so I promised to go
ahead and get that review up tomorrow
but today I was kind of in the mood to
go ahead and do a declutter so I have my
foundations here this is a little
cabinet this is the drawer that they are
currently in yes
this guy's missing a head don't tell my
mom this is an antique and this is
currently where I am storing up my
makeup the new Beauty room is a lot
different than the one that you guys saw
in Milwaukee I no longer have like the
Alex series 9 drawer or anything like
that I just wanted something that was a
little more my style if that makes sense
so this is an antique it is super super
old and beautiful but yeah this little
guy right here his head fell off so
please don't tell my mom she's gonna
literally murder me but anyway uh yeah I
thought that I would share with you guys
just kind of how I store these first of
all um I don't do anything special I
don't have little acrylic organizers
okay I just toss all my foundations into
the drawer because I can't be bothered
and this is what it looks like so
currently I have around 40 foundations
which really isn't that bad last year I
had close to 90 so I think that I'm
doing it better as far as I'm making
sure that I keep my collection a little
smaller when it does come to foundations
foundations go bad it pretty darn
quickly so I you know I had a lot that I
had to declutter last year because
unfortunately they had gone bad and I
just don't want to have to deal with
that anymore so anyway I have about 40
here and my skin type has changed I've
been talking about that and practically
every single video but yeah I've gone
from combo oily to normal dry so I
definitely want to declutter probably
about half of these yeah definitely 15
to 20 for sure so anyway let me put the
camera down and we'll get started all
right guys let's go ahead and jump right
into it I'm going to start with a few
foundations that I know for a fact I
want to get rid of definitely the Estee
Lauder Double Wear the Clinique beyond
perfecting foundation the Kat Von D
lock-it
let me go ahead and tell you why so the
Estee Lauder Double Wear stay in place
liquid and makeup has never really been
a favorite of mine I know a lot
of people do you enjoy this particular
foundation I do have the shade one and
one I've renewed it never has really
matched me and has more of a neutral
undertone at first I thought it was more
warm tone but even when I'm self tan
this still looks kind of Ashley and
strange on my skin I don't like that it
doesn't have a pump and overall I mean
yes you do this nice kind of medium
buildable full coverage very very long
lasting long wearing foundation but at
the end of the day I do feel like it's
kind of masked like on my skin now if I
did have more problematic skin which i
do when I'm in lupus flares but I mean
if I had more breakouts hormonal
breakouts like I did when I was in
college I think I would really enjoy
this I would probably go for the Kat Von
D lock it because that is specifically
what I used in college is just amazing
but if this is definitely a little bit
of like a lighter version of that so
yeah I'm just not a huge fan so I'm
gonna go ahead and let that go all right
as far as the Kat Von D lock-it
tattoo foundation is concerned I have
two here so this one right here is
called a light 42 this one is light 45 I
have to go ahead and mix the two of
these there is a huge gap between the
two shades so I just want to give you
guys a heads up but I love the packaging
I love that you can see where you are
with the product I have been purchasing
this since I was in a college these are
not the bottles from college obviously
but I have been purchasing this for
years I just don't have the skin that
can handle this anymore it's a little
too drying I feel like I can't really
blend it out even with a damp sponge
some people were saying why don't you
just use it as concealer I feel like
these will go bad before I finish that
office concealer I have a lot of
concealers in my collection it's just
not worth it so I'm going to go ahead
and declutter those all right moving on
we have the Clinique beyond perfecting a
foundation plus concealer the shade I
wear is 0.5 briefs is that correct yes
0.5 burries I should have gotten B shade
lighter called linen I'm just because
this does oxidize if you've never seen
it before it's basically just a big doe
foot kind of applicator I usually just
do three or four strokes all over my
face and then I will blend in it with a
damp sponge similar coverage and kind of
the same sort of finished as the Estee
Lauder and double wear these aren't
completely mattes but you do get that
full coverage look but you still have a
little bit of something left there and
now for me when I have that kind of
feeling on my skin of like
a kind of heavy but non matte
full-coverage foundation it just feels
mask-like to me so some people will say
Oh feels moisturizing it's nice you know
it doesn't dry me out for me it's just
it's just not what I'm looking for
anymore so I'm gonna go ahead and addict
letter that all right what else do I
have in here that definitely is being
declutter these guys from Becca these
were recently sent over for PR I took
off the little stickers here the names I
can't remember what the names are but
these are the ever matte shine a proof
of foundation so I didn't really have
any intention of trying these out for
myself because obviously I have more
normal to dry skin now but I did it let
my friend try these out and I tried them
out just because they were sent over for
PR I want to be able to give you guys my
thoughts I did yours back try out the
ever matte primer which is insanely like
insanely mattifying I mean you you get
this like thick kind of liquid you tap
it into your like your nose area and I
swear it's just it's like oil absorbing
times 100 okay this is definitely the
same sort of thing I can't get this to
work for my skin I tried adding oil it's
just it looks like okay it really
looks like and I might include
these in product sales videos possibly
because I did try them out okay I tried
them out three days in a row and it was
actually this week so if you saw my
foundation looking a little funky this
week you probably know why but I mean it
just wore horribly really really patchy
around my nose area I'll talk about it
more when I do my product fills video
but yeah those are not good I mean I
understand that they're not for my skin
type but at the same time I mean it was
just it was extra awful all right up
next we do have the Tarte Amazonian clay
full coverage foundation in the shade
fair beige I will be going ahead and
holding on to this I love this this is
what I like to wear on stage and I
really do enjoy full coverage
foundations to have like a mousse like
texture so they don't feel heavy on the
skin so I'll be going ahead and keeping
that up next we have a drugstore
foundation from Neutrogena this is the
healthy skin liquid makeup I love the
way that this looks on the skin however
I just can't get this shade to work for
me I try and I try and I try it and I'm
done trying the shade is called classic
ivory it's just too big and then it
turns yellow and it's just it doesn't
look good on me so I'm gonna go ahead
and declutter that all right up next we
have the hourglass illusion hyaluronic
skin tint I did not like this and when I
first did a first impressions on my
channel
and I had more combo oily skin but I
love it now this is my holy grail
foundation currently it is just
absolutely beautiful I really really
like the consistency again kind of like
a whipped or mousse like consistency I'm
really into that because it feels very
light on the skin it definitely is not a
skin tint okay it definitely has the
capacity to be like the it cosmetics CC
cream it has you know aged sheer to
medium you can build it up to medium
coverage so I would feel like it's more
of a foundation but this is very very
pricey if I can find a drugstore
alternative that is cruelty free I will
keep you guys updated but yeah I'm gonna
hold on to that alright up next we have
the market Jacobs this is the genius gel
supercharge foundation I love this this
is beautiful on the skin I know
everybody talks about the remarkable
foundation but again you know this is
more of like that satiny sort of like do
we look on the skin so if you don't want
to do the remarkable and you're scared
of it like I am because I feel like
that's just gonna look like on my
skin I've seen a lot of people look like
dry skin try it out and it didn't look
good but if you are scared of that
foundation don't be scared of the other
foundations from Marc Jacobs this is
beautiful this shade right here which is
called ten ivory light matches me
perfectly when I am NOT self tan so it's
a really really nice match currently I
do have to mix this with the NYX pro
mixer in warms to kind of deepen it up
but it's a beautiful beautiful solid
medium coverage nice kind of do me
finish it's just absolutely stunning on
this gap all right up next we have
another a product here that was sent for
PR from pure this is the bear at all
12-hour four and one skin perfecting a
foundation so I got this when I was
living in Milwaukee again I haven't
really purchased any like heavy duty
foundations while I've been down here
just because I don't feel like it's
worth it the only ones that I have tried
out are the becca ones like those are
kind of brand new but i haven't been
purchasing super super full coverage
foundations because it's just not really
my style anymore but I didn't like this
in Milwaukee or when I had more compo
oily skin and I don't like it here it
really is thick and sticky and tacky and
it's a kind of foundation where you're
putting on your foundation and then
suddenly like hairs are getting stuck to
your face because it's that sticky now I
would recommend going ahead and using
the oval brush that comes with this you
can try it with a sponge
honestly this breaks up on my face
throughout the day I know it says
12-hour wear but I feel like that estee
lauder double wear definitely wears a
lot better than this does even my
hourglass illusion hyaluronic skin tint
wears better than this so the shade is
called porcelain by the way I love the
squeezie too but there are some good
things about this it smells like
cherries it's kind of a cool scent but
overall it's not something that I would
purchase with my own money and I would
not recommend to those of you who do
have normal to dry skin alrighty
moving along so I just had to check to
make sure that you can stop recording we
have another what is this okay this is a
drugstore foundation or skin tint this
is the Neutrogena hydro boost hydrating
tint I did a comparison between this and
the hourglass and I hated both of them
again back in Milwaukee but now I love
the hourglass I can't hang with us you
guys I just can't it really sinks into
my pores and it's the strangest thing
because I'm like is it too hydrating
like is it too hydrating for me I don't
understand because I have another
product here from Bobbi Brown that's
honestly too hydrating I'm gonna hold on
to it because I need that for like
special occasions but this one is just
the strangest thing ever I mean it sinks
into like fine lines and then it will
sink into the pores and then you see
these little dots like where your pores
are where the product actually like sunk
in I've tried pairing it together with
like a silicone based primer because I
thought okay that will create a barrier
it still looks like so yeah this is
not the foundation for me I'm gonna go
ahead and declutter that again classic
ivory got Neutrogena needs to work on
their shade selection alright up next we
have the it cosmetics yours give a
better CC illumination cream with SPF 50
I really do enjoy this and I am going to
keep it however I would not repurchase
this I have decided to stop supporting
it cosmetics when it comes to their
foundation range just because they
really don't cater to everybody and I
did a video about this the other day
I'll go ahead and throw it up in the
cards if you guys are interested but I
don't want to show support for a brand
like that if they're not going to be
inclusive to everyone so I will use this
up this one is really nice if you do
have more normal to dry skin there are
glitter particles in here so just be
warmed I really shade fair it does match
me but again they're not inclusive with
their shades so if you can find a shade
I mean maybe you want to check it out
but I don't know I don't want to support
like that anymore all right up next we
have the Bertha B's a BB cream with noni
extract my friend Rochelle sent this to
me she did not like it I love it I have
the shade light in SPF 15 and this is
more like a CC cream it's got that sort
of dr. jart greyish cast to it so when
you put it on your face it kind of color
corrects your whole face you don't have
to go in with concealer or anything I've
just been loving BB cream CC cream skin
tints all that kind of stuff so I'm
gonna go ahead and hold onto that
alright guys continuing on I wanted to
say really quickly in case you guys are
wondering this is such an old piece so
yes it does have some little marks and
bruises and stuff on it it's not dust it
literally is just it's an antique so
anyway let's go ahead and talk about
this baby here is the Urban Decay Naked
skin
weightless Ultra Definition liquid
makeup I wear these shade is 0.5 I will
absolutely a hundred percent and be
keeping this it is beautiful
I love the way it goes onto the skin
it's just the perfect foundation without
being like oh I'm wearing a foundation
it just makes your skin look better so
what if I CLE recommend this to those of
you with like all sorts of different
skin tones and skin types I feel like
this works for everyone and they do have
a nice shade selection so would highly
recommend that we'll be keeping it all
right up next we have the Bobbi Brown I
know I just talked about this very very
briefly this is the Bobbi Brown extra
SPF 25 tented and moisturizing balm in
the shade alabaster tint as hand cream
on right now and I feel like I can't
open this okay I can't open it but it is
this really really thick kind of balm
moisturizer but it is tinted I have had
this for quite a while now this cost me
like $80 I don't know why I wanted this
this is actually kind of made for people
who do have more like mature skin or
super super severely dry skin but I
wanted to try it out and I hated it
obviously when I was combo oily because
it just it didn't work for me I tried to
use it in a project pan video I liked it
now for the days where I have shows
because I put this on and I feel like no
matter how much foundation I put on to
my face this ends up making it look more
natural and seamless so I will keep it
for that I would not repurchase though
because Bobbi Brown does test on animals
alright let's see
what is that okay Mac this is the face
and body foundation in white this used
to be my mixer I have now switched to
this baby right here which is the NYX
total control drops in the shade of pale
and these have more coverage you have to
add a lot of this into foundations to
actually lighten it up so I'm gonna go
ahead and keep the next one and I will
declutter the Mac all right what else
let's talk about these babies because I
know they are very very talked about and
these are the L'Oreal infallible Pro
matte foundation and the L'Oreal
infallible Pro glow I have two zero one
classic ivory and then this one is 101
classic ivory I will be keeping the pro
matte it's a very very comfortable on
the skin I barely have anything left
it's a wonderful foundation but L'Oreal
obviously does tests on animals so I
wouldn't repurchase the pro glow I've
never been a fan I mean even with my
more normal to dry skin this breaks up
on my skin so easily so quickly and I
feel like it oxidizes as well I hate the
scent on it
would I just I don't like this would not
recommend alright moving on we have a
beater BB tinted a primer broad-spectrum
SPF 30 so this was something I loved
when I was more combo oily and I have
the shade fair I have not tried this yet
since I moved to Arizona so you guys are
gonna have to what is that little fuss
you guys are gonna have to let me try
this out one more time and then I will
keep you updated on if it's still
working for me I remember this being
like a cream to powder and I'm kind of
nervous like cream to powder here in
Arizona especially when I still set my
whole entire face in with you know
powder I'm kind of worried this is gonna
be too much but I want to try it out
because I loved this this is amazing if
you do have more combo to oily skin it's
beautiful it's just it gives a lot of
coverage I know it's a BB tinted primer
treatment but it really is kind of like
a BB cream and it's like a cream to
powder really truly alright moving on we
have the Revlon Colorstay whipped
foundation this is in the shade one at
10 ivory I used to love this I feel like
it gives really nice coverage and the
shade 110 ivory is actually a pretty
good match for me personally it's just a
little too heavy for me nowadays and I
feel like I don't need that coverage
level unless I am in a lupus flare so
I'm gonna go ahead and let go of that
all right up next we have the Anasazi of
Beverly Hills stick foundation this
particular shade is called what are you
called porcelain
I am going ahead and decluttering this
as well you guys I just I can't get
along with stick foundations anymore all
of them feel so drying ever since I
moved to the desert so I really did
enjoy this there wasn't a whole lot of
product to begin with in here but I did
use this quite a bit I feel like it's
really nice if you do have more combo
oily skin
we're not recommend if you are dry I
heard the new Tarte one it's a little
better as far as stick foundations are
concerned if you are a little more dry
or the makeup forever won't be testing
that one out since makeup forever does
test on animals but I don't know I don't
really understand the hype of stick
foundations the only thing I feel like
they're really really good for is
they're convenient and they're nice for
travel but anyway I'm gonna go ahead and
declutter that alright moving on we have
these drawers your Armani a luminous
silk foundation I were the shade at
number two I'm so sorry to say but this
is a beautiful foundation and I will be
keeping it in my collection I don't know
why I'm saying I'm sorry to say but it's
because you know Armani tests on animals
and that does make me kind of sad but I
feel like if I love it and if I'm using
it and I know I won't repurchase it then
it's okay so if this is really really
beautiful on the skin it gives you that
kind of like dull like glow but I
honestly feel like the Marc Jacobs is
this little guy that I talked about
earlier
I feel like this gives the same sort of
vibe so if you want a cruelty-free
option go for the Marc Jacobs it's still
just as luxurious a beautiful frosted
glass bottle so would not repurchase
this but I will be keeping that in my
collection for now up next we have the
glamoflage from hard candy this is a
camouflaging beautiful beautiful full
coverage foundation now it's beautiful
but it's not for me anymore when I did
have more combo oily skin it was great
so much coverage here it actually
reminds me a lot of the urban decay all
nighter if you are looking for a very
similar product to the all-nighter I
feel like this is pretty similar it's
almost like a cream to powder sort of
finish and this one is definitely a
little more liquidy but I really like
this and this shade right here which is
called a porcelain is super super light
I mean it was it was like stark white on
me and I'm pretty damn pale so yeah that
is a really really awesome foundation
I've nothing bad to say about it it's
just not the coverage that I need
anymore so I'm going to go ahead and let
it go
as far as Urban Decay all nighter is
concerned I do wear the shade of 0.5
they need to work on the oxidation thing
that goes on here because this darkens
up throughout the day but I will hold on
to this for now I haven't tested it too
much being here in Arizona I've really
been trying to go through the rounds in
my collection to make sure I'm using
these items and seeing if I still want
to use them but this guy and at the
charts at bebe tinted primer I still
need some time with so I'm gonna put
that in the keep pile for now all right
up next we have the covergirl trublend
foundation I really like this this is a
basic bitch kind of a foundation and a
lot of people don't like it and a lot of
people won't like it it literally will
just cover some stuff but it doesn't
have SPF it doesn't have a great you
know amount of coverage it's just very
very basic and I like this when I'm
feeling like a basic bitch so I'm gonna
go ahead and hold on to that alright up
next I do have at the Becca let's see
here these are the ultimate coverage
complexion cremes in these shades shell
as well as sand so these were also sent
over for PR I have been at trading these
off between these and the ever matte
this week and I really really like this
one now I feel like a dissent and the
overall kind of feeling when you first
apply it is sort of similar to the Kat
Von D locket however and this has that
more mousse-like texture so it reminds
me a lot of the Tarte Amazonian clay you
have to be careful with this I mean if
you apply too much you're gonna feel
like a cake face you can feel that you
have foundation on your face which I
don't like so I've been taking about
half a pump of each and mixing them
together so that creates my perfect
match and I will be going ahead and
keeping both of those alright sorry
chair squeaking trying to make sure that
the SD card didn't fill up
alrighty guys moving on to the NARS
weightless all day luminous foundation
so many people hate this and I love it I
really enjoy my NARS foundations I enjoy
NARS in general I feel like the only
thing I've ever gotten from NARS that I
wasn't a fan of was the orgasm blush but
they are no longer cruelty free it would
not repurchase from them but I feel like
if I do enjoy it and I am getting use
out of it and this particular foundation
here was not tested on an animal
I am okay with going ahead and finishing
it up so I do wear these shade Gopi
which is a little more yellow tone it is
beautiful it has a little bit of like an
oily consistency some people say it's
just the strangest thing because it does
give like a solid medium coverage but
it's super super watery it's definitely
not a formula for everyone but I do like
it so I am going to go ahead and hold on
to that all right up next we have the
covergirl clean and matte BB cream from
the drugstore again I used to love this
but it's just not working for me anymore
very very full coverage here I mean this
is great from the drugstore I feel like
a Milani I also has something that's
cruelty free that is quite good it's not
B it's not the one that has the shitty
shade selection it's the other I can't
remember what it is but we clean my BB
cream I wear these shade
510 fair and it really does you know
keep you matte throughout the day which
i think is awesome it has a nice amount
of coverage but again it's just a little
too much coverage for me I'm not looking
for that anymore so I'm gonna go ahead
and let that go all right up next I have
the Urban Decay Naked skin a
one-and-done hybrid complexion Perfector
in the shade light this is the perfect
match for me currently I used to be a
little darker but I am almost done with
this as you guys can see so I'm gonna go
ahead and pan this baby up it's okay I
don't think I would repurchase it
definitely has that cream to powder sort
of finished I don't usually set my face
in with powder if I use this maybe
that's what I'll do with the tarts then
we'll see
but anyway so yeah I'll finish it up it
does have broad-spectrum SPF 20 is it
like a true one-and-done kind of product
honestly I prefer like my Burt's Bees BB
cream over that but to each their own
alright just checking on the
camera you guys I swear to god these
DSLRs I mean I'm trying to get good
quality for you guys but like come on
come on so difficult
alright up next we have the NARS Velvet
Matte skin tint with broad-spectrum SPF
30 sunscreen in teheran with a light to
0 that is my shade don't use this around
your eye area every single time I use
this I put it around my eye area and it
stings and burns like a
bitch okay this has a lot of sunscreen
in there and it definitely can irritate
your eye area but it has a nice amount
of coverage I do enjoy it and guess what
it's not that matte it this is
definitely not a skin tint either this
is definitely a foundation and I feel
like it has a satin sort of finish to it
so I'm gonna go ahead and hold
to that because I do enjoy it up next we
do have the charts BB tinted Amazonian
clay moisturizer
this has broad-spectrum SPF 20 I am so
surprised I have not seen any sort of
progress on this cuz I use this thing
all the time I have the shade ivory it
is oil-free antioxidant rich formula
formulated without parabens and mineral
oil beta lates at triskele and sodium
lauryl sulfate in gluten C guys I do
actually like products from Tarte ok
it's just some of their other stuff is
not that great but their base products
their face products are pretty damn good
so this is really really nice I mean I
love the way it goes onto my skin I love
a good tinted moisturizer down here in
the desert so I will be going ahead and
holding on to that definitely very sheer
maybe light coverage with that alrighty
up next we have the josie maran vibrancy
foundation fluid this is one of my
all-time favorite foundations I
absolutely adore this would highly
recommend for all sorts of different
skin types honestly this worked for me
when I was a little more combo oily and
it works for me now this is infused with
argan oil I believe it is vegan it is
cruelty-free I really do enjoy a lot of
products from josie maran
a really cool little trippy bottle here
this shade that I wear is dynamic I do
have to mix it with a little bit of the
NYX warmth a mixer because it is too
late for me currently but I love this
foundation is beautiful definitely gives
a glossy appearance to the skin so if
you are a little more oily go ahead and
set your face in with powder but it
lasts all day on me I know some people
say because the oil is in here it
doesn't last all day on them but it does
for me and I really really enjoyed this
I will be going ahead and keeping that
up next we have the Stila aqua glow
serum foundation I love this foundation
however ever since I have been
self-tanning this shade right here
called fair which matches me perfectly
to a tee when I'm not soft and has been
looking very funky on my skin even when
I mix it together with other foundations
other concealers um you know the NYX
warmth mixer it looks really really
funky and I i've tried it like 4 or 5
times now and i'm just not happy i want
to continue to self tan because i like
having a little bit of color down here
and i am just a little more tan in
general so i'm actually gonna go ahead
and let this go and i hate to say that
but also i did recently talked about
Stila in the video where I talked about
shade selections and Stila needs to work
on their suits
when it comes to foundation so I don't
think I will repurchase this in a
different you know a different color
just because I don't want to stand by
that I don't want to stand by that I
don't want to be the kind of person that
comes on camera and preaches something
and then doesn't do anything about it so
I will not be purchasing any of their
foundations until they can go ahead and
work on their line a little more the
deeper shades in their color selections
are just absolutely horrendous so work
on that steel up please so yeah I'm
gonna go ahead and declutter that up and
next we do have the Tarte what is this
called confidence creamy powder
foundation this is what it looks like I
have currently hit pan on this but it's
just way way way too light for me
currently um some people were saying you
can set your under eye with it but this
is a true powder foundation you can use
this wet or you can use it dry and it's
just way too white underneath my eyes as
well so I'm actually gonna go ahead and
let this go you can tell I really did
enjoy it I might go ahead and pick this
up in a different color that doesn't
match me but this one is not working and
I I can't find any use for it okay up
next we do have another powder
foundation this is from Laura Geller and
I have fallen out of love with this this
is the balance and Brighton foundation
with SPF 15 in porcelain I have the
shade porcelain I also a declutter fair
last year I should have kept fair
because Fair was like a fat side freakin
steps deeper than this one and I mean
that one would have matched me better
but this one is way too light and on top
of that I don't know what it is this
kind of gives an artificial sheen to the
skin when you do wear it by itself and
I'm just not really into that so I'm
gonna go ahead and let that go up next
we have the Smashbox camera ready BB a
water drops with a broad-spectrum SPF 30
sunscreen I really really do start was
just checking on the camera again I
really do enjoy this honestly it's like
a top 5 item for me currently I wear the
shade fair I do a mix it with a little
bit of the NYX warmth mixer I feel like
I should be including that in this video
I will be keeping that clearly it's
really beautiful it's definitely super
super liquidy and if you don't like
light coverage this is not for you but I
really adore it so I'm gonna put hold on
to that getting so tongue-tied you guys
I hate filming declutter videos but
we're almost at where
all right up next we have the Rimmel
stay matte liquid a mousse foundation in
zero-one-zero light porcelain
lightweight shine control and yeah it
does exactly that this is very very
similar to the Tarte Amazonian clay full
coverage foundation but it's a little
more matte so I'm gonna keep the Tarte
one and I'm gonna go ahead and declutter
this one up next we have this little guy
from gosh cosmetics this is the CC cream
in the illuminating foundation version
in oh one porcelain I picked this up in
New York I think last year when I was
visiting yeah it's been open for a year
which is a little long you guys always
have to make sure that your products are
not going bad if you notice a difference
in consistency or smell definitely go
ahead and throw your foundation away
that will just do harm to your skin but
this guy has stayed in a really nice
condition I really don't have a lot left
in here to be completely honest I think
this is just filled with air but I don't
think I can repurchase it because you
buy this at Duane Reade and I don't have
Duane Reade near me so I'm going to keep
it but I don't think I will repurchase
up next I have the Laura Mercier handle
gloves soft luminous foundation in the
shade a shell and this has become a
go-to for me and that since moving down
here to the desert it is really really
nice and lightweight it's a water-based
foundation I really like it a lot so I
am going to go ahead and hold on to that
up next we have the covergirl CG
smoothers this is a hydrating a makeup
in 7:05 ivory I love this I wish
covergirl did not test on animals
because they have some great products
and this is one of them it's beautiful
it definitely has a nice amount of
coverage you can get it up to like a
medium coverage I would say you can
build it beautiful color and it is
actually hydrating on the skin so if you
have dry skin maybe you want to go ahead
and check that out we'll be holding on
to that and finally I have the
Illamasqua rich liquid foundation in our
f-100 this is a mixer and as you guys
can see here just wanted to show as an
example this has clearly gone bad you
can see that the color here has started
to fade a little bit and go yellow so
I'm going to go ahead and test that
alright guys so here are the piles over
here I have the pile of foundations that
I will be keeping will be nice a mixture
of some luxurious some high-end as well
as a few a drugstore products in there
and the total for this is 23 I will be
keeping 23 foundations
and I will be going ahead and
decluttering 20 so I feel like that was
about 50% for take so I'm pretty happy I
think that that's good and the ones that
I am decluttering are a mixture of a
high-end luxury as well as a drugstore
maybe not luxury just drugstore and
high-end and then I will be going ahead
and throwing out the illamasqua a rich
liquid foundation so anyway that is it
that is the little pile of my new
beloved famous collection and then over
here we have the ones that I will be
going ahead and decluttering so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video let me know
what you would like to see next
as far as declutter videos are concerned
and I'll see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
