thank you so much for joining me before
I get started I know I sound like a
broken record but I just want to say
I've been terribly terribly busy this
week with a whole lot of gigs and I have
not been able to respond to you guys the
day of on Instagram and also on youtube

really sorry I haven't been able to do
that it will be answering all comments
tonight which is thursday so you guys
are seeing this probably at six a.m. on
thursday or in the morning and i will be
answering all comments tonight so i
apologize they haven't been able to get
back to you guys right away I've just
been really terribly busy and I'm being
a little rundown so anyway I am here
today to share with you guys my 7000
subscriber giveaway winner and also
we're going to be talking about the best
highlighters for fair skin so let's go
ahead and just start with the giveaway
winner right away so that I don't have
to drag you guys through the whole video
if you're only interested in that the
winner is Kim mantilla or mantilla
mantilla montia Kim I'm sorry I'm
totally butchering your last name but
congratulations I did contact her on
Instagram she knows that she has one and
i will be sending all of her goodies
next week so that is the winner
congratulations Kim and yeah let's go
ahead and get into the video this other
part of this video and that is best
highlighters for fair skin to sustain a
makeup wipe out here so that i can do
some squatching provide and this was a
viewer requested video so thank you so
much for requesting this video and let's
go ahead and just get started I want to
say really quickly these are the
highlighters that I think are the best
for fair skin I'm not necessarily saying
that they are my all time favorites I
will let you guys know if they are an
all-time favorite but these are just
ones that I think are very compatible
for fair skin there's some that have a
strong pink undertone some that have a
strong like warm undertone so I will let
you guys know when we are getting into
the cool tone category and also the warm
tone category so let's go ahead and get
started the first one that I want to
talk about is this one this is
relatively new to me this is the laura
mercier matt radians baked highlight in
01 this is absolutely stunning I picked
this up during the vib sale and
everybody was raving about this I think
this is a highlight that is very
compatible for all sorts of skin tones
also I like this because it has a very
neutral Undertown it doesn't pull too
much warm undertones or too much cool
undertones you guys know I do have a
cool undertone but even if you do have a
warm undertone I think this would look
absolutely beautiful on you it has a
gorgeous formulation and it's super
super lightweight like it's like you
can't even feel it on the skin I'm
really gonna build up the swatch here so
you guys can really really see it but
it's just absolutely stunning I love the
shade of this I just think it's
beautiful and it definitely complements
fair skin really really nicely it just
looks like that really slick sort of wet
a formula on your face so I really
really like that one I think that
anybody could wear that if you have warm
undertones or cool undertones beautiful
for fair skin the next one is definitely
a favorite of mine this is the drm you
dare glowing gardens powder illuminator
in the powder illuminator in the shade
001 and glowing pink first of all
packaging yes you open it up and this is
what it looks like now I am recommending
this for those girls out there that have
a strong cool undertone this definitely
pulled a lot of pink in it and I was
hesitant whether to show you guys the
bait gelato swirl illuminator in the
shade charming pink which is also really
really beautiful and I also was hesitant
to show you guys Gildan honey because
they don't necessarily think those are
perfect for fair skin those are
favorites of mine but the reason I like
this particular pink highlight is
because it has a really really nice sort
of white base to it so you definitely
could still pull this off if you do have
warm undertones in your skin but if you
have pink undertones or cool undertones
you would absolutely love this and I
don't even know if you can get this
anymore but if you have it I think it's
beautiful and it's really really lovely
so there it is the reason I did want to
show it though was because the Laura
Geller bait gelato swirl illuminator is
very very similar it definitely pulls a
little more of a pink tone but i highly
recommend checking that one out as well
and also there is a highlight from a
rock that is very similar i believe the
shade is called starlight alright and
now we're going to go into the other
lorac um no sorry this is starlight I
think the one is called Twilight I'm
sorry guys it's the one with the pinky
undertone so recently lorac released
these illuminating highlighters
picked up all four and this is the one
that I think is the best for fair skin
is the leg achay Dan the shade is called
starlight this definitely pulls a warm
undertone again so if you do have a warm
undertone and you are fair you would
love this it has a beautiful formulation
and it's got that beautiful sort of
opalescent glow to it it really kind of
yellow toned very very beautiful but
what I like is again kind of like the
Dior glowing Gardens it had a little bit
of a white face so you really could pull
it off no matter what but I think if you
do have a warm undertone you would
really really love that one all right
moving on let's talk about some cream
highlights because I think that not
everybody likes powder highlights so the
first one I want to recommend for you
guys if you have fair skin that does
pull a little bit more of a cool or pink
undertone is the clinique chubby stick
in the shade is 0-1 hefty highlight I
hate the names on all of these chubby
sticks they have like curvy contour and
hefty highlight I'm like that's kind of
unnecessary anyway it looks like this
and you just kind of roll it up like
this it is actually relatively well
priced I think these are like 20 for
dollars you do get quite a bit of
product in here but it's just beautiful
you guys it definitely pulls more of a
pink tone but it's like that super super
wet look on the skin it actually reminds
me a lot of the laura mercier highlight
except this one obviously has more of a
pink tone so when you do blend it in it
just really really goes as one with your
skin if that makes sense it really just
kind of turns into one with your skin
and it's really really beautiful if you
are someone who likes more kind of
neutral or natural highlights I think
you would really really enjoy this one
so i wanted to mention that the next one
i wanted to mention that is also cream
is the NARS Copacabana illuminator so
they have a lot of these they have I
believe Laguna which is like a deep
bronzy color i also have super orgasm
which i've used as a blush topper but
this one is really nice it pulls more of
a cool undertone again and you guys will
notice a lot of them do because i have a
cool undertone but i really like it it
has an opalescent sort of white pinky
color to it and what i like about this
is that you can mix this with your
foundation I just took so much out on my
hand wasting product anyway you can mix
this with your foundation you can use it
with a Beauty Blender on top of your
foundation it gives a gorgeous
to the skin and it's absolutely
absolutely like decadent honestly it
just looks so beautiful I wanted to
mention also one of my favorite
highlighters is the hard candy I think
it's called the doll face highlighter
it's like a pink highlighter you get way
more than you do in this particular
product and it is a cream as well
however this one in my opinion works a
little bit better for fair skin but if
you do have a deeper skin tone I would
recommend checking out the hard candy
ones as well all right that's what I
want to talk about is definitely a warm
undertones one this is the hourglass
ambient strobe lighting powder in the
shade brilliant this is probably one of
the most gorgeous highlights on the skin
I really do like the formulation on the
ambient lighting powders and especially
the strobing powder i'm going to show
you guys another and the lighting powder
in a second which is like the number one
best highlight if you have cool
undertones and your fair anyway this is
absolutely gorgeous this definitely
pulled a little more of a golden Sheen
to it however i love this like it can
really really be subtle on the skin or
you can build it up to like I really
like wham-bam in-your-face kind of
highlight and there it is and it's just
absolutely stunning it never looks cakey
on the skin it doesn't overemphasize any
sort of texture on your face it's just
an absolutely beautiful formulation if
you do have warmer undertones i would
highly recommend checking this out it's
not too dark and too gold and also i
know that they do have some ping ketones
which i have my eye on all right now
let's talk about the hourglass ambient
lighting powder in the shade ethereal
light this is one of the best highlights
ever if you have fair skin you do have
to build it up a little bit it's
basically just a cool toned white powder
and if you want to wear this as a
highlight you do have to build it up
quite a bit but honestly this is
absolutely stunning it's absolutely
stunning you can even use this as your
setting powder if you want but there it
is and I mean it is definitely lighter
than my skin tone and that's what I like
about it it's beautiful really really
lovely highly recommend alright the next
one I want to talk about is the
two-phase candlelight glow this is a
highlighting powder duo and I just want
to recommend one side so we have a pink
side here and then we have a like
opalescent white yellow side here that's
the one I want to recommend for you
girls that do you have fair skin with a
kind of warmer undertone this is a
beautiful highlight absolutely stunning
really really gorgeous and if you want a
dupe for it and you don't want to spend
what is it like $35 the makeup
revolution vivid baked highlighter in
the shade golden lights is amazing as
well pretty much an exact do for this
product it's got that gorgeous sort of
golden undertone it's just as pigmented
if not more pigmented and I love it on
fair skin so there is the Too Faced
candle glow and then there is the makeup
revolution those are both really really
beautiful I like to wear them I love
golden highlights even though I have it
fair or not fair I am fair but even
though i do pull more like pinky or cool
tones I think the golden highlight is
gorgeous so please don't feel like I'm
telling you like you can only use the
bindi one or this one you can use
whatever you want I'm just trying to
like you know color categorize them I
guess you could say you don't know how
to say what I'm trying to say I just so
that you guys can get a better
understanding of what might look the
most natural on your complexion alright
the next one I want to talk about is
another cream product this is from
colour-pop I have quite a few of their
highlighters I don't reach for them all
that often but this smoke and whistle
shade is really really nice it pulls a
very neutral undertone even though it
looks very warm it really does pull a
neutral undertone and it's beautiful on
fair complexions so let me go ahead and
show you guys that one there is smokin
whistles isn't that pretty it's just
that really sort of wet highlight
sometimes when you tilt your head a
little bit it can darken up slightly but
it's nothing crazy I think this is like
right on the border of being amazing for
fair skin because it can darken up a
little bit but not too much so I do
enjoy that a lot the next one I want to
talk to you guys about to ease the
illamasqua powder highlight in the shade
oh my god this is relatively new to me
if you have a warm undertone you would
absolutely love this again it's got that
sort of light yellow sort of gold golden
shade to it and it feels super super
lightweight very similar to the Laura
Mercier baked powder highlight and I
just love the way this looks it's very
very natural and you definitely can
build a
on the skin but it's one of those really
sort of wet highlights or wet-looking
highlights all right the next time I'm
going to recommend for you guys is
definitely more neutral and I think it's
better if you do have a little more of a
warmer undertone in your skin this can
look a little yellow on my particular
complexion but I still love it this is
the Laura Geller baked highlighter in
french vanilla and this is what it looks
like and I got a set of three of these
so i think i have portofino rose gold in
this one this one is definitely the
lightest out of all three however it
definitely pulls that warm yellowy
undertone but what I like about this is
how neutral and natural it looks it
reminds me a lot of the hourglass
ambient lighting powders they're just
almost like a barely-there sort of
highlight if you really do pull a strong
yellow undertone I think you would
really enjoy that all right and then the
last 1i got to talk about oh I have to
to talk about so the first is the becca
shimmering skin Perfector in moonlight
moonlight moonstone and then also a
Becca's pearl I cannot find pearl in my
collection right now for whatever reason
but pearl is basically the equivalent of
the hourglass ambient lighting powder in
the shade ethereal light it's just a
really really stark white color it does
not pull any sort a cool tone or warm
tone is just stark white I love it if
you work with it really really nicely
and like lightly on your skin it looks
really nice and it's not too overdone
however my favorite shimmering skin
Perfector is moonstone it definitely
pulls a little more of a warm undertone
but I don't mind I really think it's
beautiful so anyway here is a moonstone
and that is what it looks like and here
it is swatched so if you are one of
those girls that you really want to try
like champagne pop and Prosecco pop and
dim light or not to wife Thank You
hourglass now I'm sorry if you really
want to try it what's the other one oh
my god how am I blanking on this right
now opal yeah you really want to try
those ones because everybody talks about
them i would highly recommend not trying
those ones i understand that they are
super super hyped up but honestly the
best shimmering skin Perfector for fair
skin are pearl and moonstone so if you
do pull more of a cool tone maybe go for
pearl if you pull more of a warm tone go
for move
so anyway and that is is I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
