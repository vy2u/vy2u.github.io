channel today I have eight all-inclusive
recommendations for the spring 2018 sale
at Sephora for you guys
I understand sane all-inclusive is a
little tricky because there is always
somebody left out but I wanted to give
recommendations that not only work for
me but I know work for a lot of
different people this year we are doing
eight because it is the year of 2018 and
I will have all of the different info
down below in the description box if
you're wondering when the sale starts
for you it did start at 12 a.m. last
night for vib Rouge so I'm gonna go
ahead and walk you guys through my
recommendations and yeah let me know if
you're gonna pick any of these up
alright let's go ahead and start with
the abundant product that I think would
work for a lot of different skin types
as far as skin care is concerned this is
from drunk elephant ooh this is EC from
a day serum now if this happens to be
sold out I would definitely recommend
looking into the littles kit where you
can try out all of these different
products from drunk elephant as well as
their little deluxe sized samples of the
marula oil as well as the sea from a day
serum this is going to work if you have
more acneic skin because it is going to
help to clear up breakouts it's really
great if you have more mature skin
because it has a little bit of virgin
marula oil infused interior so it's not
going to dry out your skin you can use
this in the morning you can use it at
night that's absolutely fantastic for
hyperpigmentation and I just think
across the board a lot of different
people could use this and a lot of
different people could see results from
this so that is the one skin care
recommendation I'm going to give you
guys you've been watching my channel for
a long time it will come as no surprise
that I'm going to recommend the Becca
highlighters the shimmering skin
Perfector press come in a poured version
as well as a pressed version as well as
a liquid version if you have more dry or
mature skin you might prefer the liquid
version a lot of different people really
do love the pressed version though and
if you have the poured version you might
be somebody who likes to wear a little
more minimal make-up I find that the
poured version sometimes does to stir
but my foundation so I don't love it as
much even though I do have dry skin but
I would definitely say go and check
these out too when you are in store they
are a little more on the pricey side
which is why I do recommend purchasing
them during the sale and they have a ton
of different shades to choose from that
are very much inclusive for all sorts of
light skin tones medium skin tones as
well as deep skin tones and if you are
someone who loves a little more of a
colorful highlight I would definitely
recommend looking into the light chasers
again these
a nice shade selection this one right
here is called opal flashes Jade and
they're a little more colorful and they
have a little more of a dual chromatic
vibe so I would definitely recommend you
look into a Becca highlighter during the
sale some points I think everybody
incorporates a little bit of shimmer or
glitter into their eye looks and look no
further than these steel of glitter and
glows or these steel and glimmer and
glows or shimmer and glows these are
really really fantastic I only have some
of these Tila glitters here to share
with you guys today if you are someone
who enjoys a little bit of high shine
impact but you don't want anything too
intense I would go with either gold
goddess or diamond dust so this one
needs to be built up just a little bit
and my number one recommendation for
these Tila glitter and glows is to go
ahead and tap them onto your lid wait
until they dry down and then go in with
a dry q-tip and clean up any sort of
mistake that you might have with a
duochrome formula
I love into the blue as well as sea
siren really really pretty especially if
you want a shifting color on your eye
now if you want something a little more
neutral smoky storm is incredible this
one's super super pigmented it goes on
really nicely even when you just Pat it
on and this will go with a lot of
different eye look so this is even like
work office appropriate in my opinion I
wear this to work and I don't get in any
trouble and then finally I'm violet
vixen this is great if you want a little
bit of like a purple smokey eye or you
want to go ahead and put this on your
lower lash line this has incredible
pigmentation and a little less of the
litter in it it's more shimmer but a lot
of pigmentation as you guys can see so I
really think those are great I know some
people say they have a hard time working
with them again I would recommend going
ahead and tapping these on or smudging
them onto the lower lash line with a
brush wait for them to dry and then go
in and clean up throughout the day all
right I know for foundation everybody's
going to be recommending the Fenty one
but the 51 is not necessarily
all-inclusive because it doesn't really
work for more mature skin and super
super dry skin or I think the Urban
Decay Naked skin foundation can really
hit up all sorts of different
complexions you have some really nice
light shades some darker shades you also
have a really nice formula here that is
great for dry skin it's great for mature
skin it's really nice fun combo oily
skin I tried this out for the first time
when I was definitely more oily in the
middle of summer and as long as I pair
it together with a mattifying primer
it's great it's got a decent amount of
coverage I would say medium coverage
that you definitely can build up a
little bit so if you need more coverage
you can go with this but it
looks like skin it is very flattering on
a multitude of different skin tones as
well as skin and types so definitely
would recommend looking into the Urban
Decay Naked skin foundation all right I
do kind of hesitate recommending a
fragrance because I think that cents are
so incredibly personalized but I'm gonna
go out on a whim and say that Elizabeth
and Jane or fragrance company that you
are going to find something that you
like from they have really really great
warm sense nirvana black is a little
warmer they also have bourbon which is
my all-time favorite nirvana white is a
little more fresh and clean amethyst is
supposed to be kind of like a juicy
scent so if you like a little more
sweetness that one's supposed to be
really nice and then what else do they
have it a rose scent which again is very
very sweet and Paris together
beautifully with bourbon so I'm gonna go
ahead and put that out there just so you
guys know I get asked all the time what
can i purchase that is cruelty free and
vegan as far as fragrance is concerned
Elizabeth and James is the way to go now
for brow product I would definitely say
the Smashbox brow tech to go is
excellent you can also just get the
regular smashbox brow tech the only
difference is that this one right here
has a two in one so on this side you
have a little bit of brow gel that you
can go ahead and put through your brows
i never was able to finish this up
before i finished up in the actual brow
product as you guys can see I use this
till the very very end and I actually
discovered this product in 2017 I will
be purchasing a new one I'm probably
just gonna go with the regular brow tech
because I saw that this one currently is
sold out unfortunately I did email
Sephora and they said they are
restocking within the next 24 hours so
definitely jump on that but this is
great if you have a lot of brow hair or
if you have a little tiny about a brow
hair I tend to have a lot of eyebrow
thinning in the front part of my brows
and I love that I can take the flat side
of this and really really just fill in a
nice chunky amount of brow but then over
here where I have a little more brow but
I just want to get a little bit of a
tail I can just lightly fill it in by
tipping it to the side I can get those
sculpted brows or a really really basic
and everyday sort of natural brow with
this product so that's something I would
recommend to you guys and then as far as
the lipsticks are concerned I know I'm
like sound kind of silly like what's
all-inclusive when it comes to you with
lip products or lipsticks but by beauty
is definitely a brand I would
checking out during the sale just
because these are so incredibly
expensive these are they're a moose
Boosh
bullets lipsticks I also do have one of
their liquefied lips on today in the
Shea glass say these are absolutely
beautiful as well however they are a
little more heavy now just so you guys
know these aren't vegan they do have
beeswax in them and they can be a little
heavier on the lips in general but the
pigmentation is there the shade
selection is there you will be able to
find something from by beauty when it
comes to lip products so definitely
would recommend looking into them during
the sale and finally let's go ahead and
talk about concealer recommendations I
have one that I think is going to work
for a lot of different people and is the
cap on the locket tattoo concealer creme
the reason why I am putting this as an
all-inclusive sort of thing is first of
all it has a fantastic shade selection
and second of all you really can make
this work for your skin at time now I
obviously have more dry skin and I'm a
little more fair complected so I have
this shade white out right here which I
like to mix together with more hydrating
a sort of concealers if you can see this
doesn't really budge it is a thick sort
of creme if you're worried and you have
more dry skin or mature skin and you're
thinking this is going to show all the
creepiness and fine lines and wrinkles
and all that stuff underneath your eyes
do not fret you could mix this together
with an eye cream and oil you can mix
this together with a moisturizer you are
going to get a really really nice I
would definitely say medium to full
coverage concealer creme that is going
to cover up everything I don't even
really have to set it to be completely
honest it's not gonna fall into those
fine lines and wrinkles it really stays
nice and plump all day long and like I
said very very long wearing so anyway
guys those are the eight different
recommendations that I want to give to
you for the Sephora spring 2018 sale
thank you so much for joining me guys
