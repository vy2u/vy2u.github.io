first voiceover so I hope I'm doing this
right
I found this footage from last week that
I lost the audio for so I thought today
I would just kind of Frankenstein this
 and put it back together and upload
this video because uh last night's video
was a little rough on me and I don't
really want to be on camera today to be
completely honest but anyway today we
are doing a mini makeup curd you guys I
have some wise sell products Urban Decay
NARS Abeka stuff like that and my purge
videos are different from my D clutters
these are quick and snappy any sort of
product that I see that I don't want to
pack into my moving boxes I go ahead and
I let them go so yes I am moving in six
weeks and I do purge videos every time I
move if I don't want to take up the
extra space as far as packing is
concerned I will leave the product
behind I will donate it I will give it
to friends so these are from YSL I used
to be obsessed with why I sell lip
products and this is the back knee I
live popped water glossy stain in four
zero one or two zero four dewy red I
don't have the products in front of me
I'm just looking at the screen
and maybe what it is and then I also had
the why I sell beloved Tintin oils I had
two that I showed you guys but I do have
five in my collection I will be
declaring all of them it's not that
they're bad products because I used to
be obsessed with these lippies you guys
but I just feel like I've been reaching
more 4-byte products I've recently
gotten into you know liquid lipsticks
and heavier sort of formulations I used
to be all about that lip oil life but
now I'd like to take a little more risk
okay
so I'm gonna go ahead and drop those
wild lip products here is a mascara from
Laura Mercier this is I think like a $34
mascara you will see I'm going to have a
difficulty here mm-hmm
I can barely unscrew the lid and that is
because this is nine months old I have
this thing about leaving my mascaras out
it's very bad very unhealthy do not
leave your mascaras for nine months you
guys maybe four to five tops not nine
this reminds me a lot of the lash
renegade from a wet and wild so if you
want that like trifecta lash you want
the length of the volume the thickness
and kind of like a tacky formula that's
going to stick to your lashes not
transfer or dry down and flake off
throughout the day like the better than
sex I think you would really really
enjoy the lash renegade this guy is very
similar like I said
but it's $30 it's not cruelty free why
would you go for this one when you can
get lash renegade the only thing I want
to recommend with lash renegade is go
ahead and clip off the ball at the top
but seriously the ones on these guys are
great they really get into every little
tiny lash hair and yeah you will poke
yourself many many times in the eye but
it is worth it it is definitely worth it
I feel like recently the drugstore has
been producing so many good at mascaras
like the lash princess from essence I
recently tried out last renegade is so
good I I don't need these mascaras
anymore I still want my Marc Jacobs
velvet noir but I don't need any other
high-end mascaras alright guys let's go
ahead and move into some little blush
palettes here these are the blushes of
teal palettes from Lancome we have rose
flush as well as apricot dream I think
it's called that's the one you're
looking at right now we have a contour a
highlight and a blush I basically got it
for the blush talk to you when I used to
watch her like two years ago recommended
the Rose flush and she was saying it's a
very silky it's very beautiful and it
definitely is but only only the blush
sorry I'm choking on my saliva as usual
only the blush is beautiful you guys the
contour doesn't even show up on my skin
tone and I'm pretty fair and the
highlight is glittery and chunky and
it's like almost not there it feels like
starch or something I don't even know
how to describe it's a super weird thin
consistency it's horrible so I'm not
just gonna depop this just for that
blush because you know what luminoso
from Milani looks very very similar to
this this one's a little deeper but I
definitely can dupe this out of my
collection might as well go ahead and
give it to a friend who will actually
use it and then I will show you guys
what Rose flush looks like and like I
said you know this was a recommendation
from Tati way back in the day I remember
going into the Lancome counter and
purchasing these for $45 apiece and I
definitely got more use out of this one
right here it's a beautiful light pale
pink sort of color but again so easily
duped in fact Illamasqua as naked Rose
is very very similar to that one so I'm
gonna say goodbye to those Lancome
blushes of teal palettes I just don't
need them anymore I don't reach for them
often enough all right another blush
that I am just not I don't get the hype
you guys NARS blushes are so hard to
pick up on a brush they're not soft you
know they don't blend very well I don't
see what the hype is about this is
 orgasm
orgasm is going bye-bye okay it's the
first time I haven't wanted an orgasm
and then here we have the velvet lip
lights I have nine of these I will be
declaring all of them
I still do enjoy the formula but I have
been reaching more from my bite Beauty
liquid lips over this now these are a
little more lightweight but lately I've
just been enjoying the color selection
of the bite beauties this one right here
is in the palace if you guys are curious
alright it's up and next we have this
stupid little chubby stick Clinique eye
stick I've used it once it was a piece
of so we're letting go of that I
don't even have a review for you guys
and then here we have the Lancome shine
lover lipstick in 714 never wear that
shade here is another lip product that
disappointed me immensely I'm glad I
didn't purchase it for $30 I know so
many of you love the Becca glow glosses
but I really can't get over that scent
you guys it's just really really strong
it's just a way too overwhelming for me
so no to that here is the afterglow
palettes the ONS from urban decay I
really did enjoy this I've only had it
for about four months but I have a
friend who is requesting this palette
she wants to get her hands on it she
can't get it and she will not pick up on
a Stassi at Beverly Hills she has like
beef with the brand so this is
comparable to Sun dipped so I'm just
gonna go ahead and send it to her and
then here we have the Becca gradients
glow highlight this is just a little too
dark for me so I'm going to send this to
my friend Toni it's gonna look great on
her complexion hi Toni if you are
watching and yeah that's pretty much it
guys so I'm sorry they're you know not
too many reviews with a little purge
videos like this it's just me kind of
getting rid of some before I move
by Tyga it's pretty much it thanks for
joining me see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
