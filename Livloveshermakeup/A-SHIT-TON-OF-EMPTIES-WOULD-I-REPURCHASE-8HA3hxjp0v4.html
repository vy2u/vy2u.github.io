welcome back to my channel today I have
an empties video for you guys I have a
shit ton of empties I have some makeup I
have some skincare and then some
miscellaneous things so let's go ahead
and jump right into it I'm going to
start with two different primers that I
used up at the past couple of months and
this is the NYX abort glow illuminating
primer in white and this is the ordinary
high adherence silicone primer now you
guys can see khaleesi got into my
empties bin she loves makeup so there's
little bite marks here but don't worry
she didn't swallow anything so the
ordinary high adherence silicone primer
is only $4.99 I really enjoyed this
however I don't feel as if I can support
the ordinary right now there's been a
lot of stuff going on with this
particular brand so right now I'm not
going to be repurchasing this but when
it comes to the next board to glow
illuminating primer this is the best
illuminating primer I've ever found
personally I believe it does retail for
$14.99 and you can usually get one a buy
one get one 50% off or buy two get two
free on the Ulta comm website it's
beautiful it smells really good I think
this looks a lot more natural on the
skin as far as illuminating primers are
concerned not really like the Beca first
light and backlight priming filters this
one is so much better and it does also
have a little bit of slip as well as
hydrating properties so really do enjoy
this primer actually it's probably one
of my top five favorite primers at the
moment alright here is the Carrie grand
lip whip this one is in mint to Barry it
smells super good it is the cinnamon
scent and if you guys have never tried
out the karyogram lip whips they
definitely are worth looking into
they are super pricey but you can find
them on the Sephora comm website I
believe that they are vegan and I know
for sure they are cruelty free but this
was just a tinted sort of a whip and I
like to wear it on my lips throughout
the day so probably would go ahead and
repurchase that now here I have the elf
makeup mist and set as well as the
Milani make it last setting spray I
would definitely repurchase both of
these you can get like four of these for
the price of this one there isn't a huge
amount of product in the Milani but it
really does make my makeup last all day
long and it smells amazing so would
repurchase both of those here is the
essence all about Matt fixing compact
powder I only finished off one of these
because I've been at trying to get
through some other non cruelty free
powders recently but I love this
absolutely would repurchase it is one of
my favorites to set my whole entire face
in
I did use up this little mini to face
hangover RX replenishing face primer I
do enjoy this primer it's kind of like a
light tinted moisturizer or tinted
moisturizer now it's like a light gel
moisturizer so if you don't want to
purchase this you can always just go
ahead and put a nice layer of
moisturizer on and you will get the same
sort of benefits but it does smell good
and it does brighten up my complexion
and it is quite hydrating for my dry
skin so maybe I would purchase a another
full-size and then the last makeup
product that I used up with the Smashbox
brow tech to go in taupe I recently
purchased this in the blonde shade and
it is not good for me it is way too warm
tone very very like honey colored and I
pull definitely a little more of a
cooler undertone even my hair even
though it is naturally kind of a dirty
blonde I have been darkening it up a
little bit recently it doesn't pull warm
it pulls ashy so I love taupe but be
blonde shade is just not good for me so
I would repurchase this in the taupe
shade alright guys let's move on to some
skincare I did finish off the Burt's
Bees micellar cleansing water this is a
three-in-one that removes makeup it
cleanses and it hydrates I actually
really did enjoy this I the best and
worst of Burt's Bees coming up for you
guys pretty darn soo and I think
probably within the next four to eight
weeks I'm doing a lot of pre film videos
just so you guys know so it is coming no
matter what it'll be up this summer so
yeah this is definitely one of those
products from Brits fees that I think is
very very good if you get it directly in
your eye it does sting a lot of micellar
waters will sting your eye if you get it
there directly this compared to these
simple micellar water I still prefer the
simple but you do get a large amount of
product in here and it is 99.5 percent
natural all right I finished off wow
that was loud I finished off the body
shops a tea tree skin clearing facial
wash I like this for washing my brushes
I also like using it on at my face this
is a really really good price and if you
are someone who is really into benzoyl
peroxide and salicylic acid and you're
noticing and then unfortunately your
skin is getting a little used to that go
ahead and try something like this tea
treat is great for clearing out the
pores it's also quite nice for just
removing impurities as well as helping
with breakouts so I do enjoy that and I
would probably repurchase
all right I've used up the pixie skin
treats h2o skin drink pure hydration gel
I loved this the only thing I don't love
about it is the scent there are some
sort of like sage rosemary kind of vibe
going on here I love the packaging I
really like the consistency of it it
really does help to hydrate my skin
throughout the day but it's kind of on
the pending list just because of the
scent it definitely made me break out
the first couple weeks that I used it
because of the fragrance level in here
it's just very very strong I honestly
wish this did not have any fragrance in
it whatsoever by time yeah
it is a good product I do enjoy the
formula alright here is the drunk
elephant bestie jelly cleanser my
all-time favorite cleanser on planet
earth I use this to double cleanse so
I'll go in with a cleansing balm or
cleansing oil and then use this to
remove my makeup I also mix it with a
little bit of sugar in the morning to
get a nice scrub going it's beautiful if
you get it in your eye it doesn't hurt
it removes makeup it honestly is the
best cleanser it's super super pricey so
I am looking for an alternative or a do
for you guys but would highly recommend
if you do have normal to dry skin
alright my boyfriend actually finished
off these super glow serum this is from
glossier
I picked up three of their serums I have
the super pure as well as this one and
then I also had I can't remember the
other one but I've used two of them up
one of them up okay Khaleesi got into
this too I used one of them up which was
really nice and hydrating super pure is
also really really great if you have
some breakouts and he said super glow
was just okay he did not notice any sort
of brightening with his complexion so um
I don't know it says to brighten an
energized dull tired skin apply over
clean face and follow with moisturizer
so he wasn't the biggest fan now I need
to dry it
alright guys more skincare I did finish
off three different eye creams the first
one is the time bomb skincare eye
perfection gel with Brazil nut - this is
from the balm cosmetics it was nice but
I personally don't feel like I creams do
that much this one is the skin Iceland
Iceland tick relief eye cream this did
not do shit for my skin so obviously
would not repurchase in fact I'm not
repurchasing any eye creams for the next
year and then here is the true organic
pharmacy lip and eye cream I like this a
lot because I actually like to use it on
my nipples when they hurt that sounds
weird but it's a nerd - the treats and
it refreshes it's kind of like a thick
a-bomb and I don't know when my nipples
are dry or soared during my period it
feels nice to put that on them so that's
what I used it for here is the pixie
skin treats and nourishing cleansing
balm with sweet almond oil and cocoa
butter so many
people hate this because it is not one
of those cleansing bombs that you can
just rinse off with water you actually
have to use a washcloth so I'm actually
a huge fan of this because it leaves a
little something to the skin it does not
strip my skin in any way shape or form
it takes off my makeup beautifully you
just have to follow up with a cleanser
like the best e-jelly cleanser from
drunk elephant that's usually what I do
but it's beautiful I really like it I
know it's a product a lot of people do
not enjoy but I would repurchase here is
ocean salt from lush I absolutely love
this I used to purchase the full-size
container and use it on my body but then
I thought shit the stuff is really
really expensive so now I get the small
one and I like to use it on my face I
will use this as a physical exfoliant
probably about once or twice a week it
does have a little alcohol in here so if
I'm breaking out I'll let it sit on my
face for a little bit because it helps
to heal my pimples up it smells like a
margarita it's just really really good
very very nice a physical exfoliant but
being very very gentle especially if you
do have sensitive skin
st. Ives blackhead at clearing the green
tea scrub it says it clears blackheads
and calms redness it has salicylic acid
1% in it I've been planning this for a
while it was just okay nothing too
special st. Ives does tests on animals
so I would not repurchase here is a
little mini origins ginseng energy
boosting a moisturizer Khaleesi I also
bought into this she's a bad girl this
was just okay I had high expectations
because I used to love the refreshing
eye cream but honestly the ginseng line
isn't as exciting as it seemed so many
people hype it up and it just I don't
know I've tried every single product
from the ginseng line now and I'm not
super impressed now obviously this was
something that I purchased as well as
the kit I purchase of the ginseng items
I got before I went cruelty free last
year so if you did it no origins
although they are very natural and they
have like natural ingredients in here
they do tests on animals which is pretty
shitty so obviously I would not
repurchase all right here's the bare
minerals oil obsessed total cleansing
oil I purchase one of these and returned
it because the fragrance in here kind of
similar to the skin drink from Pixy
really irritated my skin again it's like
sage or rosemary or something
now uh and I just couldn't use it on my
face I returned it and then my mom was
like I found this new cleansing oil that
I'm obsessed with let me send you a
bottle and she sent me this um I was
like No
so what I've been doing is actually
using this to remove swatches on my hand
it even does leave irritation on my hand
after so I'm definitely allergic to
something in here obviously would not
repurchase but it does remove makeup
quite well here is the Josie Maran Argan
infinity intensive creamy oil again
khaleesi went in on this I love this if
you have dry skin you absolutely need
this in your life it says 100% pure
argan oil mixed together with essential
fatty acids and vitamin E very very
nourishing if your combo skin or oily
you're probably not gonna like this but
if you're drier than dry like I am you
should pick it up right miscellaneous
stuff I have this rose perfume right
here this is from Jean FA it smelled
really really good I think I got it in a
boxycharm like eight or nine months ago
oh there's still a little bit left it
just smells like pure rose and I did
enjoy it however I looked at the price
on this and it's way too expensive for
the amount that you get in here it does
tend to fade throughout the day I can
taste it it does tend to fade throughout
the day but it did smell good and I'm
happy I used it up it takes a while for
me to use up perfumes I have two little
body butters here this is the acai
bought a bit acai body power cream this
is from sol de janeiro and this is the
almond milk and honey from the body shop
I prefer this one the scent on the acai
body power cream is not as good as their
original scent like the boom-boom cream
that smells fucking fantastic this one's
a little more tart and sour smelling and
it really doesn't firm up my body all
that much so would not repurchase a
full-size of that and then the almond
milk and honey I would get a full-size
of this it smells great very very
hydrating and the body shop is all for
cruelty free so I love that alright here
are some 100% cotton rounds from 365
this is the Whole Foods brand that I'll
be getting some reusable cotton rounds
actually from Etsy very soon so I'll
update you guys on that but yeah these
were fine here is the Avalon organics
refreshing lemon and glycerin hand soap
a glycerin is so nice for your hands
especially if you get very very dry
during the winter time this smells
really good we had in the kitchen
absolutely would repurchase
a warm vanilla sugar bubble bath from
Bath and Body Works you guys know I no
longer purchase from them I just was
getting back and forth
answers on their cruelty-free status
which I'm not a big fan of it did smell
good but I don't know there's so many
more bath products that I've tried
recently that just makes me feel like
they are so generic which I understand
they are and I know that Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works is pretty cheap things like that
but this is obviously not something I
would repurchase I did burn through a
soy much a brighter candle I've told you
guys about these would wick candles
before from Etsy they smell incredible I
can't open it but this one is past the
cider there's soy a vegan and and they
says rad but this particular scent is
apple cinnamon nutmeg and clove would
definitely repurchase and then here we
have a I like apricot whipped
moisturizer I like a apricot apricot how
do you guys say that let me know down
below this is something that went bad in
my collection unfortunately I got it
from HauteLook probably about a year ago
so yeah it was nice it did work well it
was cruelty free but I didn't get to it
before it uh turns I could tell by the
scent it got released I were smelling
and then finally I have this little
candle right here which is called I'm
sorry it's from the keepers of light
this is lemon butter pound cake I
actually picked this up when I was in
San Diego about four months ago with my
boyfriend and it smells amazing they
were handmade candles I'm gonna go ahead
and decant this little jar so anyway
guys oh my goodness those are all my
empties I hope you enjoyed this video
thank you so much for joining me and I
will see you on Monday bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
