channel and welcome back to my finals
and had a great oh where I share with
you guys new products I have been loving
this week and of course as always the
products I have not been loving there
are three fields for the week one of
them is kind of like a whole by itself
so let's go ahead and start with that
this was a mascara pairing that I tried
to get to work this week I love pairing
together mascaras I love really really
spidery clumpy looking lashes so I
attempted to pair together the Marc
Jacobs velvet the marketing top the
velvet to our mascara with the wet and
wild alleged renegade this is no bueno
this was not a good combo in my opinion
I feel like the Marc Jacobs takes a very
specific a mascara to layer with because
this is a very very wet and goopy sort
of formula and then when you get the wet
and wild lapse renegade which almost has
a little bit of like a sticky tacky
formula it's just not a good combo so
although I do love these two mascaras by
themselves together they are just not
good so I will not be attempting to pair
the two of those together again and then
the other fail for the week is the Urban
Decay all nighter waterproof full
coverage concealer in the shade fair
warm my friend Samantha did send this to
me she got a huge PR package from Urban
Decay which was amazing and she wanted
me to try this out unfortunately it's
just not for me you guys I feel like I
really require a certain concealer now
that I have dry under eyes I actually
tested this out in a first impressions
video which I'll go ahead and throw up
in the cards about a month ago or maybe
a month and a half ago and I really
wanted it to work for me however it just
didn't and it didn't work out on the
first impressions either but because
that was just a first impressions video
you know news flash - the beauty
community a first impressions is not a
full review you have to continue to test
a product out and I did continue to test
this out and it did not work for me it's
just dries way too quickly it really
emphasizes fine lines texture wrinkles
creepiness underneath my eyes so that is
not the concealer for me all right guys
let's go ahead and get into the Holy
Grails now the first one is from Sunday
Riley it is the UFO ultra clarifying
face oil this is a 1.5% salicylic acid
treatment and then it basically combined
with an oil it is very very nice and
moisturizing on the skin I don't use a
ton of spot treatments anymore just
because I feel like that's almost too
much for my skin and literally use a
benzoyl peroxide cleanser the other
night and my
was bright red I mean I can't handle
those really really harsh acne of
fighting the products anymore I had my
period about a month ago I'm not a month
ago a week ago I also had it a month ago
but I had my period about a week ago and
I did get a lot of the hormonal
breakouts that I always get along my
jawline so I have been using this every
single night it does have quite a strong
punch and smell to it like a lot of
Sunday Riley products they don't add
fragrance into their skincare products
which is great but it does have a little
bit of like a basil and musky sort of
mixture going on here now I have had
this open for I believe about six months
and now the texture hasn't changed the
scent hasn't changed so it's still good
in my collection a little goes a very
long way so if you are going to purchase
a full-size of this just know that ahead
of time this will literally last you a
year even if you use it practically
every single night so if this is great
for those of you with dry skin who do
suffer with breakouts once in a while I
have been loving at that another product
I have been loving is actually from pur
cosmetics now you guys know I'm pretty
salty with PR because they kicked me off
their PR Atlas and it's not that I'm
salty because I'm not getting free
product I don't mind buying my own
I have no problem with that what
I'm selfie is about is the fact that
that they sent me something and it was
just one little thing it took one
 product for me not to like and
they just booted me right off I don't
like that I think that's just a
pussy-ass move I'm sorry I'm say so
myself there are plenty of brands who do
semi PR that are not scared of my
reviews though girl care cosmetics
whatever but this is the bronze and
Brighton palette and it really is
 phenomenal and gorgeous you have
a blush in here a highlight as well as a
bronzer now technically all of these
could it be a highlight so if you wanted
a peachy highlight on deep skin tones
this will be a peachy highlight if you
wanted a champagne colored highlight on
any sort of skin tone even fair
complexions if this is your highlight
and then here I mean if you had the
deepest of deepest complexions you could
probably use that as a highlight or a
blush topper they're very very shimmery
but they are like a big jala of formula
and they have that like texture to them
but they go on so pigmented so beautiful
you guys will be able to see there's
definitely a little bit of chunkiness
there but I love those foiled kind of
formulas so I have really been into this
I love that there's a mirror this was a
great little face palette I've been
using the blush every single day as well
as the highlight
right guys up next let's talk about the
eyeshadow palette that I have had on my
eyes absolutely all week long you
probably saw this in my keep ten drop
ten eyeshadow palettes declutter part
three of five that I actually filmed
towards the beginning of the week so
I'll go ahead and throw that up in the
cards but you guys I love this palette
my friend and Meg actually sent this to
me this is a drugstore brand apparently
in Australia so I think that you can
order from Australian websites if you do
want to get this palette but obviously
none of the shades have names I believe
that this is really really a reasonably
priced or at least that's what I've
heard and this is a gorgeous palette and
this is coming from someone who doesn't
love a warm toned eyeshadow but you have
noticed probably every single day I have
been wearing warm toned eyeshadow the
only problem with these shadows the only
problem with these shadows is that they
do tend to blend away and kind of fade
throughout the day they're not as
vibrant as when you first initially
apply them however they're smooth
they're pigmented the mattes in here are
 amazing I don't think I've ever
ever experienced a kind of cheaper
alternative from the drugstore even if
it's not the drugstore in the US I'm
sure that it's a little more pricey over
in Australia but I've never experienced
like an alternative kind of drugstore
price to brand that has this silky of
shadows I'm not even kidding right now
there are a lot of brands out there and
then have silky shadows like this but
they're mostly in be very very high
range so this is a beautiful palette
again I've been loving the warm toned
eyeshadows I really don't mind because
of how gorgeous these are on the eye and
how well they blend and how nicely they
go on this is a cruelty-free brand if
you are in Australia and you've never
tried anything from chichi I'm sure you
have but the diva eyeshadow palette is
fantastic alright guys let's talk about
the foundation I have been wearing all
week long it is the Marc Jacobs genius
gel supercharge foundation the shade I
wear is ten ivory light this is
currently being discontinued from Marc
Jacobs because the new shapeless
foundation which we'll be releasing soon
with I believe around 39 different
shades is coming out very very soon so
that's kind of like the repackaged
version it's gonna come in a squeezy
bottle a lot of people are complaining
about that but if you've ever had to
deal with the emerg a Cubs genius gel
foundation bottle you would know that
when you pump this out it starts to
trickle down like
so I'm actually kind of excited for the
new squeezy to but this is a gorgeous
foundation you guys it's a demi matte
sort of appearance or finish on the skin
it has a very very nice skin like glow
to it so you definitely don't look too
matte it's not too much coverage late to
medium buildable coverage a really
gorgeous on the skin at nice wear time I
love this foundation so that is the one
I have been wearing all week long and
finally guys let's talk about the lip
product of the week shall we the lip
product I've been wearing every single
day this week is the meet Mac hue long
lasting liquid lipstick from the balm
cosmetics in the shade charismatic this
is just gorgeous it's kind of like a
that really really a pretty a mid-tone
nude color so it doesn't lead to peachy
it doesn't lead to pinky it's just a
really really nice and neutral kind of a
shade I really liked when I put it on my
lips because I don't have to be too
exact even though it is a liquid
lipstick it's what I have on today it's
almost like a your lips but better for
me personally this is just probably two
or three shades darker than my normal
lip color so that is a great
long-lasting a liquid lipstick very
comfortable on the lips I have been
putting a gloss on sometimes throughout
the week but today obviously I just have
this on by itself so anyway guys those
are my fails and holy girls for the week
I would love to know if you had any
fails for the week if you have any
holding Grails to you hate
everything did you love everything that
you tried out let me know down below
I'll see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
