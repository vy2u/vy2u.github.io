my channel today's video is going to be
a review at demo swatches in comparison
on the new Aurora goloka Aurora Aurora
glow kits from a stuffy of Beverly Hills
this is exclusive to the Anasazi of
Beverly Hills calm website I have no
idea if it is going to be permanent or
limited edition the moon child's Lok it
did start off as being limited edition
and now it's permanent so it's quite
possible that this will also be
permanent it is $40 like I said it is
cruelty free and also vegan and Anasazi
Beverly Hills in general has a lot of
vegan and it well they are cruelty free
brand but they do have a lot of vegan
items and this particular guy right here
is so this is a collection of six
metallic powder highlighters that give
intense luminosity to the skin and body
it says layer shades of honest toffee of
Beverly Hills glow kit or apply
separately on face and body for a
radiant glow it is ideal with the brush
a 23 I don't even have that brush so
 that but it also says you can mix
together with a hydrating oil for a body
glow so if you want to be like a little
holographic unicorn and put like Orion
or like the purpley is spectra color all
over your body you can do that and it
will look amazing I mean does also say
it complements the best-selling moon
child okay quite nicely and I do agree I
think these are really nice as base
colors and then going in with the moon
child on top is really gorgeous as well
alright so anyway let me show you guys
the packaging this is what it looks like
it does come with that typical sort of a
slip so this is what it looks like
it does say cruelty free and vegan on
the back as well is list all of the
ingredients you kind of have like this
holographic effect going on here I'm not
the biggest fan of these Anastacio
Beverly Hills glow kit packaging just
because I do feel like they are very
very cheap but the thought behind it is
that you do kind of like de pot them
I've never actually depotted any of my
glow kids normally what you have is like
the four pan and you can actually slip
the product out but with these guys it's
a little more tricky I think I will be
doing a video for you guys soon on how I
do pop items but I have never tried to
do that with this kind of product right
here so this is what the layout looks
like you do have six different shades in
here and the shades are eclipse which is
a pink champagne pearl with a peach
reflect you also have Luna which is a
mother-of-pearl with an icy orchid
reflect you have spectra which is the
sparkling lilac pearl with an iridescent
Bluegreen reflect
elio which is a yellow gold pearl with a
turquoise reflect you have a ryan which
is a blue pearl with a purple amethyst
reflect and
or lira which is a rose gold pearl with
a champagne orchid reflux so lots of
reflective things going on here lots of
holographic miss duochrome whatever
really really beautiful and one of you
had said the other day on my Instagram
you felt like this was kind of the
summer glow kids like you know if you're
comparing like the moon child and this
one this one's kind of for summertime
and then this one right here the mood
child is kind of more for wintertime and
I totally 100% agree they layer together
beautifully but these icy tones in the
moon child definitely remind me more of
the wintertime whereas this one reminds
me more of the summertime so let's go
ahead and start with just kind of my
thoughts overall I think it's a really
really nice glow hich I have noticed
lately that Anasazi of Beverly Hills has
kind of been playing around with their
formula a little more and I know a lot
of people did not like the last glow kit
that came out which was the Nicole
Guerrero glow kit I personally did not
have any issues whatsoever with that
glow kids but I do notice that there are
some shades in this particular one that
I'm not the biggest fan of and the
shades that I am talking about are
libratory rrah
and also the shade right here which is
called Luna I was very disappointed
because both of these do have extreme
chunks of glitter in them and I do not
think glitter looks beautiful on the
face especially when you're wearing it
as the highlights because it will start
to emphasize texture on your skin if you
have even the beginnings of fine lines
and wrinkles like I do it will just
emphasize that whole area so it makes it
hard for someone with more mature skin
or even if you're just starting even if
you're just in your mid twenties like I
am you do probably have some fine lines
and wrinkles and also if you're younger
and you have texture on your skin large
pores things like that this is going to
be hard to pull off or at least those
two shades are the rest of them Eclipse
hylia Orion and Spectre are really
really nice I will say spectra and Orion
which are the two really really kind of
darker shades actually do somewhat work
as a highlight I'm going to go ahead and
put spectra on with you guys as the
actual demo and then I'm also going to
demo Luna so you can see what that looks
like but for the most part I would say
these two are the oddballs all-out just
because they do have that really really
kind of deeper tone to them but they are
a lighter pigmentation level now these
shades Eclipse as well as Helia are
definitely definitely that typical
anastacio Beverly Hills kind of foiled
finish and I think they look beautiful
on the skin but this shade right here
which is Helia I do find it to be a
little bit of an interesting kind of
color and I will go ahead and show you
guys how I apply that as well so overall
I think pigmentation is pretty
and good across the board I just wish
these two guys right here did not have
glitter in them and then the spectra and
Orion shades I actually am glad that
they're not super pigmented because it
makes them a lot more wearable and it's
the same sort of thing with the moon
child aglow kit they did the same thing
with like purple horseshoe and also blue
moon they're not as pigmented as the
other four shades and I think that's
important because you don't want to just
have like a stripe of purple on it will
look like that especially if you do have
a fair complexion like I do if you
really build it up but for the most part
they're actually surprisingly wearable
which is awesome this is definitely what
I would consider a collector's item a
very unique kind of collector's item so
if you do have the anastacio Beverly
Hills moon child glow kit and you love
it to pieces you will probably love this
as well just be aware that there are
some shades in here that do have glitter
infused into them as far as where time
is concerned I think these are
absolutely awesome I don't seem to have
any issues whatsoever but those two
shades lighter or Lyra and also Luna I
do notice that I do get fallout with the
glitter throughout the day but overall
you guys I would say it's still a really
really nice little palette like I said I
feel like Anastasia has kind of been
fooling around with their glow kit
formula and some people might think it's
for the better some people might think
it's for the worse what is going on what
is that my hair is like sticking out
anyway so people I think it's for the
better some people might think it's for
the worse I don't mind trying out the
different kind of formulas that they
have but overall I think it's a good
value you get lots of product in here
lots of different color selection and
these also can double as eyeshadows now
the ones that again are very tricky to
wear as eyeshadow are Luna and again
Lyra or Lyra just because they're so
chunky and you're going to get fallout
with that glitter but everything else
actually goes until eyes really really
nicely so this is a super cool palette
you also can wear it on your lips there
doesn't seem to be any sort of
ingredients on the back here that I can
see that would make you know your skin
irritated where your lips irritated but
yeah really really happy with this I
think it's a really fun collector's item
to have so let's go ahead and jump into
the demo I'm going to share with you
guys really quickly the kind of brushes
I like to use with this so normally with
like the moonchild glow kit I love using
a fan brush I do not feel like I can do
that with this particular one and I'm
not quite sure why I think the formula
is just a tiny bit different when I
compare the ingredients on the back I
can see that they are just a little
different but normally with the
moonchild I love using this Nicole
conceal EO tart brush or I also really
like using my luck C 514 which is
technically like a blush brush it's very
very nice
not densely-packed whatsoever it's got
really nice fluffy fine bristles and I
feel like that applies color really
nicely now for this particular glow kit
I really have been enjoined these two
brushes right here the first is the
Sigma tapered highlighter f-35 this one
is just a little more densely packed
than say like the Luxy brush and then
right here I have another Lexie this is
the 512 small contouring brush and I
feel like if you are working with the
newer kind of formula that they have
been releasing lately it's very very
thick and foiled it's really nice to
kind of buff these into the skin if you
did pick up the nicole guerrero glow kit
and you're having a lot of issues with
glitter what I would recommend is taking
a brush like this and really buffing it
in as well so I'm gonna zoom you guys in
here and we're going to go ahead and
apply a few these highlighters to the
face so we are going to start with the
shade of spectra which is this one right
here that purpley shade again taking
that luck see what is the small
contouring brush I'm going to pick that
product up right here and I'm going to
go ahead and start kind of buffing that
on to my cheek area and you guys will be
able to see like it is purple I'm not
saying that it's not purple but I still
think it does look quite pretty on the
skin and I feel like it's somewhat
wearable especially if you're doing like
festival makeup or something like that
it's really not that bad now you can see
when I do put the brush in there you do
get a little bit of kick up with this
particular product but it's not anything
that I feel like I need to kind of like
brush or tap off the excess product with
especially when it's a little less
pigmented or at least this color is so
there is the shade of spectra on now
let's go ahead and take these Sigma
tapered highlighter f-35 I'm going to go
into the shade Helia which is one of the
ones that has like a little more of like
a golden or green tone to it it's kind
of similar to Lucky Clover I'm just
going to pick that up and I'm going to
go ahead and start building that on to
the skin and you guys will see this one
definitely had in my opinion a little
more of like a foiled finished or a
foiled look to it I know I'm going to
look crazy because I have a bunch of
different colors going on on my actual
skin but I actually think that this is
very very pretty it goes on very like
wham-bam in your face as you guys can
probably see and it will definitely give
you a glow so with this kind of formula
right here the ones that are a little
more pigmented like this I do like to
take it down to the apple of my cheek
again it can be slightly tricky because
these are a little more like
twisting kind of colors but at the same
time I still think they're really really
nice so just kind of going like that I
think it looks very very pretty and then
as far as the more chunky shades are
concerned what I like to do is go in
again with that kind of like more small
contouring brush I'm going to take the
shade of Luna which is this one right
here and I'm going to show you guys what
I like to do so I pick it up I do tap
off the excess and you will see the
glitter and then I really like to buff
it in to the skin so if I apply it to
the chin really kind of blend in
circular motions fallout galore and then
around my nose areas well I really kind
of buff it so you guys can see I mean
now I look like I have like a
multicolored face but you can see that a
lot of these are quite pigmented I would
say the only one that isn't super super
pigmented and in-your-face is that shade
right there which was the spectra but
for the most part these are quite pretty
and they are quite nice on the skin and
I do it like that all right I'm gonna go
ahead and get a little bit of that off
my nose so they look a little crazy now
but yeah that is personally how I like
to apply them if you're applying the
more like chunky shades I would go in
with a little more of like a blending
kind of brush and then the other ones I
feel like you know my Sigma f-35 picks
up the colors quite well so let's go
ahead and zoom you back out now oops
oopsie let's go ahead and zoom your back
out and now we are going to jump in and
do these side-by-side swatches so the
first shade that I'm going to swatch is
the shade Eclipse which is this one
right here this one is kind of like the
peachy color it's kind of similar to
lira or Lyra when it's on the skin but
it doesn't have nearly as much glitter
in it so there is the shade Eclipse next
I am going to take the shade of Luna
again this is the one that does have a
little more glitter to it and when you
pick it up you can feel you can feel the
thickness going on there and you can
feel the glitter particles and you guys
will be able to see it's a little more
chunky it has some fallout but still
very very pretty on the skin the next
shade I'm going to swatch is spectra
that's the one that we went on this side
of the face with and that is the lighter
kind of purple shade and this one
definitely doesn't have that huge amount
of pigmentation to it which i think is
actually quite good and then next we're
going to go in with the shade Helia
which is more of that gold green shade
this one is very very interesting in my
opinion it's just a very very
interesting kind of shade there it is
and then we have a ryan which is the
blue
this one's a very very party you know
especially when you do we're on this
geta actually looks quite complimentary
especially if you like that very very
icy kind of highlight so there is Orion
and then finally we're going to go in
with the shade Lyra
or Lyra and that is the one that I
really do feel like is quite chunky but
as you guys will see it's very similar
to that first shade so there it is and
then there is that one and that is what
the swatches look like now let's go
ahead and do a side-by-side comparison
on the other side with the Anastacio
Beverly Hills Moon child I'm gonna start
with a blue-ice star and purple
horseshoes so there they are let's do a
blue-ice first which one is blue eyes oh
yeah okay house why why in a minute
so there they are and I just feel like
these ones do go on a little chunkier
but at the same time they have a little
more pigmentation to them which is kind
of interesting now let's go ahead and do
the bottom three which are pink cards
lucky clover and blue moon so here is
pink heart lucky clover and blue moon
and you guys will be able to see that
that green is shade in the moon child is
kind of similar to the Helia shade but
yeah there they are side by side you
guys so here is the Anastacio Beverly
Hills moon child glow kits watched one
swipe swatches and here is the Anastacio
Beverly Hills aurora glow kit Aurora
glow kit swatched one swipe swatches so
as far as like colors are concerned
there's like a little bit of overlap
going I feel like pink heart is kind of
similar to those more peachy shades from
the Aurora that kind of purply shade is
sort of similar to like a mixture of
blue moon and purple horseshoe and then
of course the lucky clover shade is kind
of similar to Helia but for the most
part I think they are different enough
and again if you're a collector
you're probably going to want both of
them in your collection but if you
already have the mood child that this
one if you already have the mood child
do you need this one I don't think it's
a necessity I think this one has a
better formula I like the way that it
really does look like a true highlight
no matter what shade you're wearing and
overall I would just say you know if you
have two big one I would go with the
moon child but this one definitely is a
nice item to have as well so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for joining me guys and I will see
you tomorrow for a YouTube made me buy
it on the tart shape tape bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
