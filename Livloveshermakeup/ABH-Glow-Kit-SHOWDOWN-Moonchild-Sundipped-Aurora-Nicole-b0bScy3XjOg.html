channel today's video is going to be a
highly requested one I thought I would
go ahead and do a side-by-side
comparison of the four anastacio Beverly
Hills glow kits that are currently
available all four of these are
available for $40 apiece on the Anasazi
of Beverly Hills comm website if you do
spend over $25 you get free shipping and
honestly beverly hills shifts very very
quickly now I do know that you can get
these Sun dipped on the ultra calm
websites you can also get the nicole
guerrero on the Sephora calm website and
also I think the Sun dipped now this one
is currently out of stock on the
sephora.com website but like I said if
you shop directly from anastacio Beverly
Hills you can get all four of these so
anyway I thought this would be fun
because I adore I adore the anastacio
Beverly Hills cloak it's every single
time they release a new one I pick it up
and I review it and I practically always
say the same thing I'm in love I think
these are absolutely beautiful very
universally flattering I love that they
play with different sort of shades they
do different sort of fun like dual
chromatic looks they do some fun bright
colors they do some neutral ones I feel
like you can find a glow kit for you and
what I want to say really quickly is big
disclaimer these are like I said be very
universally flattering so although I'm
going to be talking about in this video
what I think might be best for your
complexion or your skin tone or your
undertone please take it with a grain of
salt
I'm very fair complected I can pull off
all four of these glow kits I just
wanted to give you guys a little more
insight and be a little helpful because
one of the questions I get asked all the
time is which one should I get so let's
go ahead and jump right into which we
are going to start with my all-time
favorite which is the moon child this is
what the moon child the glow kit looks
like now I hate is it packaging on all
of the UH Nastasia Beverly Hills glow
kits a lot of people ask me why it's not
so much because they're cardboard I just
love having a mirror I love having a
mirror with everything okay now you have
to understand that you're getting six
pans of highlighting here for forty
dollars which is an awesome deal so I
can understand why they didn't spend
that extra amount to go in and put a
mirror in but like if I could have a
mirror with a lipstick with an eye
shadow single I would have it I am
somebody who literally will throw this
in my purse and travel throughout the
day and I like having a mirror so that's
really the only reason why I don't like
the packaging the four pans that come
like this this one right here is the
Cendant if you were curious I do have
this shade on right here today which is
called no that's one this one right here
which is called moonstone as my
highlights these ones actually do pop
out of the pan the six pan palettes do
not but anyway
the motels locate I think is best for
those of you with a fairer complexion
now again anybody with any sort of
complexion can use these it looks great
on dark skin it looks great on medium
complexions it looks great on fair
complexions but there's something about
that holographic dual chromatic goodness
that just looks extra like ethereal and
really really awesome on fair
complexions so this is definitely one
that I would recommend if you do have a
fair complexion especially if you do
pull a cool undertone some of my
favorite shades in here on Lucky Clover
pink heart and I also really like star
right here now I will say one of the
things I notice right off the bat with
these is the fact that not every single
shade is created equally these are
probably the weakest and pigmentation
compared it to the other Anasazi of
Beverly Hills glow kits that I'm showing
in this video but it kind of makes sense
because when you're putting colors like
this on your face you don't necessarily
want them to be full pigment you can see
a lot of these have a little bit of a
shift to them they have some purple or
blue undertone so it really does kind of
make sense that they made it a little
lighter now purple horseshoe as well as
blue moon do you have a little bit of
chunkiness and glitter enos in there but
blue ice pink hearts Lucky Clover and
star really look beautiful and foiled
once you get them onto the skin so I
don't say if you want to play around
with some dual chromatic or holographic
highlights you do have a fair complexion
or a medium complexion any complexion I
think this is a really really wonderful
one let me go ahead and swatch my
favorite shades for you guys so this
first one right here is star as you guys
can see really really beautiful kind of
icy bluish color and it almost has a
little bit of like a silver or gray
undertone to it very very creamy formula
absolutely beautiful my all-time
favorite is pink heart too this is a
beautiful icy pearl shade with a little
bit of a pink shift it looks incredible
on fair complexions especially if you do
pull that cool undertone so there it is
as you guys can see they are quite
wearable you know that it's not going to
be straight-up like oh my god there's
blue on my face they are still wearable
which i think is great
next we do have Lucky Clover this one
has a little bit of a greenish shift to
it which again really really love that
and you guys can see again it not too
pigmented quite wearable and then the
final one is a blue ice no blue ice does
feel slightly chunky to me sometimes but
this one does have a little bit of a
blue undertone and I just think these
are beautiful so we're definitely
recommend if you do have a fair
complexion you want a glow kit that you
can wear almost pretty much every single
shade at least four out of the six I
would HIGHLY
men to the moon child alright let's go
ahead and move on to the Aurora or the
arrow as I like to say this is the
Aurora glow Kid 2 this easy newest one
to the collection and a lot of people
describe this is kind of like these
summer glow kits now there are a lot
more pops of color in here we have Lyra
we have spectra we have Orion which are
obviously like oh my god blue purple you
know orange kind of highlight going on
here but this is a beautiful beautiful
palette as well if you want to play
around with a little bit of color you
have a light medium complexion even a
deep complexion I think this is going to
be a lot of fun for you now I will say
as someone who does have a fair
complexion spectra and Orion are a
little too deep on me even though they
don't have too much pigmentation they
still aren't just a hair too deep for me
but Lyra Helia Luna and Eclipse I can
actually wear as highlight so again this
would be flattering for a lot of
different skin tones if you do have a
very very deep complexion you're gonna
have to build up a ryan inspector just a
little bit because they do go on a
little more sheer but as you guys can
see these are really fun highlighting
shades and if you do want to kind of
jump in on that trend of just having
something a little more colorful I think
this is the way to go so let me go ahead
and swatch these for you so that purple
shade that we have right here is called
spectra it does have a little bit of
almost like a green shift to it which is
really cool and we have Orion which is
like that blue shade these go on very
very foil they actually feel a lot
creamier than the moonchild glow kit in
my opinion and I will say I feel like
these are more pigmented now these two
shades are not as pigmented in the
palette again because they want them to
be a little more wearable but you will
see right here here's the shade Eclipse
let's do Helia and let's do Lyra you
guys are going to be able to see the
amount of pigmentation on these these
are just one swipe swatches is pretty
darn obvious so the one thing I will say
is the two kind of orange shades in here
Lyra as well as Eclipse look very
similar on the skin Eclipse does have a
little bit of chunkiness and glitter
enos to it and the shade right here
which is called Luna which I'm sure a
lot of people with a fear undertone or a
fair undertone a fair complexion are
going to want to reach for as you guys
can see it's very chunky and you know
what it goes onto the skin chunky when I
did my review on this I said that was
probably the worst shade in the actual
palette but I feel like if you do take a
buffing brush and you really kind of
buff it into the skin you can get rid of
some of that kind of glittery fallout
and you can kind of get rid of that
chunkiness so anyway this is a beautiful
glow kit if you want to play with some
color if you want to kind of step
outside your comfort
get something on the markets that not a
lot of brands are kind of putting out if
that makes sense it's a very very unique
palette in my opinion I would definitely
go for that one
alright next let's go to is the Nicole
Guerrero blow kit I love this one it is
absolutely beautiful now a lot of people
were asking me I showed this in
yesterday's video they were like what's
going on with the oil leakage here so um
the formula on this is incredibly
pigmented incredibly soft and creamy to
the touch I just think that these are
very very saturated with like a
hydrating sort of oil now I'm not really
bothered by this some people are again
it comes back to like the packaging if
this was in like a nice tin or something
like that this obviously wouldn't be
happening but it is in cardboard
packaging um it really doesn't bother me
I know it's bothering some people a few
people were asking me if it bothers me
it really doesn't so anyway just wanted
to touch on that quickly now this
palette is beautiful I do feel like it
has a lot of warmer undertones to it
there are two shades that are a little
more cool toned we have forever licked
which is a little more cool town and
then Forever Young which is my all-time
favorite shade um but the majority of
these the majority of these I feel like
would look at the best on a medium to
deep complexion now I do have a fair
complexion I can still pull it off like
I said it looks like I said obviously
all of these are very universally
flattering in my opinion but I think
that this would be the most flattering
on a medium to deep complexion Nicole
Guerrero herself has like a medium
really glowy tan complexion so I feel
like she kind of created this palette
for complexions that are around the same
as hers so anyway um the shades in here
are beautiful forever lit and kitty cat
definitely are a little more on the
chunky side daydream very very chunky
but I actually use that as a blush
talker topper kentucker as they blush
topper now you guys there have been a
lot of people saying that this is like a
glitter bomb on their face if you do not
like a little more grit to your
highlights I mean they feel creamy and
buttery but if you don't like a little
bit of sparkle I should say if you don't
like a little bit of sparkle to your
highlights this is not going to be big
loket for you if you have more mature
skin really dry skin this meat emphasize
some texture fine lines wrinkles any
sort of you know texture that you may
have along your cheek area or your nose
area wherever this may not be the glow
kit for you I would go with something
more like the moon child or the aurora
or even the Sun dipped what happened
which have that really really kind of
foiled consistency this one is just a
little on it the chunkier side now I
really don't notice that much of a
difference what I like to do with this
is buff it in with a small kind of
contouring brush and I don't notice a
ton of glitter if you are noticing a lot
of glitter you're applying it with like
a fan brush or something go in with a
fluffy brush after and then take off the
excess a lot of people don't want to
have to do that extra step I don't feel
like you should have to do that extra
step but I just want to let you guys
know although this looks very beautiful
and very very tempting it is a little
more on the chunky side and now the
shades I really really love like I said
are forever young and forever lit is
probably one of the worst in here again
it's kind of like the Aurora glow kids
that pearl eyes kind of white highlight
just came out really really chunky and I
don't really know what's going on if you
like this one and Luna just kind of came
out in a chunky gross way and it is a
little disappointing if you do have a
very fair complexion because this would
be the truest highlight on you okay a
lighter than your skin tone but that
doesn't mean that you can't use the
other shades I can still get away with
wearing kitty cats I can still get away
with wearing Forever Young I mean I
think they're beautiful on the skin and
I will say the one thing I notice about
these highlights like I said a little
bit of a little bit of chunkiness there
what I will say about these highlights
is that they do look darker in the pan
they do on the skin there's something
about them once you get them on the skin
as you can see there's kitty cat
and then there's Forever Young they
looked a lot darker in the pan they just
looked a little more wearable on the
skin which i think is great but I just
want to give you guys a heads up so yeah
if you are someone who really cannot
deal with a little more Sparkle with
your highlight I would stay away from
this College if you're someone who has a
medium complexion if you pull like a
warm undertone you don't mind a little
bit of a sparkle I think this is going
to be a great glow kit for you very very
universally flattering very beautiful
there's a shade for everyone in here and
I really do love it alright and finally
we have these Sun dips glow kit this is
my second favorite glow Kate you guys
this is actually the for pan so as you
guys can see that is what it looks like
I do have on the shade moonstone today
as my actual highlight and these are
beautiful the four pans tend to have a
little more of like a foiled consistency
to them I also have the sweets cloak it
didn't want to show it in this video
just because first of all I don't know
where it is I packed it up already and
second of all I do feel like it's just
uh yeah I don't even know if you can get
anymore to be completely honest I just
feel like
weird for me to show something that was
little bit addition that you can't get
any more but these are beautiful you
guys these are these softest creamiest
most foiled almost baked chalet formula
that you're going to find from anastacio
Beverly Hills and I notice that all of
it the quads are like that so let me go
ahead and swatch some of these colors
for you here's the shade of tourmaline
tourmaline keep forgetting how to say
that one of you corrected me tell me
again
drama lien tourmaline is a beautiful
beautiful almost purple e silvery sort
of highlight then we do have the
moonstone shade we asked to have the
shade of summer I mean these are really
really stunning in my opinion I think
that these are just really really
beautiful to go on
they don't emphasize any sort of texture
I feel like if you have a medium or deep
complexion these are going to be
stunning on you
and I want to say even as someone who
does have a very very fair complexion I
can use this as a bronzer with a very
fluffy brush I can use both of these as
highlights they may not be a true
highlight lighter than my skin tone but
that doesn't mean you can't get you a
glowy complexion with them now I would
say this is probably best for those with
a medium to deep complexion you are
probably better off going ahead and
picking up the mood child if you have a
very fair complexion but overall if
you're okay with playing with some
darker highlights and still getting that
beautiful kind of beachy glow I would
definitely go for this one it is
stunning and this bronze shade right
here at my friends - Nora wears this a
lot and it is a beautiful blush topper
on her so anyway guys those are kind of
my thoughts on the UH Nastasia Beverly
Hills glow kiss you know I love all of
them so it's kind of hard for me to be
like picking and choosing but I would
say medium to deep complexion go for the
Sun dipped if you have a medium
complexion or deep complexion again I
feel like the Nicole Guerrero is made
for you but only if you're okay but they
sparkly kind of highlight fair light
medium deep aurora glow kit very very
interesting fun to play with lots of fun
colors if you're a little more reserved
with your highlights probably not going
to like that and then if you do have a
fair to light complexion you need the
moon child so thank you so much for
joining me guys and I guess I will see
you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
