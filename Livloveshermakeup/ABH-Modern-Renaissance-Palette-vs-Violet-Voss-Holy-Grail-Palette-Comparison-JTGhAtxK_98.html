today's video whoa my necklace was like
all crumpled up all right
in City is the video I have a quick
little comparison for you guys on to
eyeshadow palettes that seemed to be
very very similar so we are going to be
doing like I said a little comparison on
the new anastacio Beverly held a modern
of renaissance eyeshadow palette vs and
the violets boss Pro eyeshadow Holy
Grail palette so we're gonna be talking
about how these are similar we're gonna
address the topic are they a dupe for
each other but we also are hopefully
going to answer the question for you and
which one is right for you and then I'm
going to tell you guys which one is my
favorite in which one I would choose
over the other if that makes sense so
let's go ahead and I'm gonna give you a
little bit of basic background
information on the two of these
eyeshadow palettes they by the foss eyes
shadow palette retails for $52 it is a
little harder to get your hands on
because you can only pick this up in two
locations on their violet bascomb
website or in Ricky's New York stores so
it is a little topper to get your hands
on it its $52 you do get 20 shades in
here and you are getting one point eight
grams of product in each pan so here is
a close-up of the Holy Grail eyes shadow
palette as you guys can see you are
getting some nice kind of foiled or
shimmer eye shadows in here luster
shades as well as some Mac's you do get
really nice black sleek packaging that
is awesome and you know I feel like it's
so compact you get 20 shades in there
they do have a mirror and they do have
the name on the names on the actual
palette as well
now the anastasi of Beverly Hills a
modern of renaissance palette looks like
this beautiful outer packaging it does
open up and you do get a dual sided
brush as well as a mirror as well this
is $42 you can get this at uh Nastasia
Beverly Hills comm website or on the
Anastacio Beverly Hills comm website
you're going to be able to get it and I
believe cold and Macy's Ulta and it is
available on the sephora.com website it
is a permanent member to the Anastasia
Beverly Hills collection so you're going
to be able to get it at all times I'm
not quite sure if that's just going to
be available on the honest sauce
Beverly Hills comm website because still
on the sephora.com website it says that
it is limited edition but you will be
able to get this palette at all times
basically so it is technically easier to
get the me by the boss you are getting
14 shades in here and point five grams
of product in each pan so here is a
close-up of the anastacio Beverly Hills
palette you are again getting some nice
luster or foiled shades in here as well
as some mats so let's go ahead and hold
these up next to each other because I
want you guys to see how similar they
look now I want to say right away I have
done the work and I have swatch them all
out and there is no absolute dupe in
either of these palettes one shade in
here does not equal this shade or this
one is exactly the same as one in here
none of them actually are dupes for each
other however when I just hold them like
this hopefully you guys can see is a
little bit of a glare on the Anasazi one
hopefully if eyes can see there are
definitely some color similarities going
on here we are getting a lot of kind of
mustardy tones in both palettes a lot of
berry tones a lot of darker cranberry
colors we're also getting some nice like
transition shades of lighter colors up
here some brow bone shades and I feel
like both palette is capable of creating
the same sort of look now I should have
done this today but I honestly could
wear this palette on my left eye and
this on my right eye and you would not
be able to tell I feel like when these
actually go onto the skin not when
you're watching them or when you're
looking at them in the pan but when you
actually apply them to the ayah they
don't come off very differently
whatsoever they really almost look like
they are very similar and almost a dupe
the thing that makes them kind of not
doable is not so much the shade but the
finishes so like here we have the shade
Wine and Dine it's very very similar to
the shade in here called Venetian red
but Venetian red have a little bit of
like a satiny quality to it although it
is considered a matte it has a little
bit of a satiny quality to it and you
can tell when you swatch them out that
they are not similar again these sort of
things don't really translate to the eye
so if you do want to get your hands on
one of these I don't think you need the
other so let's go ahead and address
right away if you do have the Holy Grail
palette do you need the Anastacio
palette in my opinion no unless you
really really want to use like this one
for travel or if you do just love to
collect eyeshadow palettes like I do and
you're a total makeup junkie then it is
nice to have both of them but overall I
think if you already have one of these
you definitely don't need the other they
have such similar color variances you
know what I mean like they look so
similar in tone they have similar colors
they have similar finishes again not
identical dupes but they are so similar
to each other in color that I just don't
think it's necessary to have both if you
don't want to have both if you don't
need both basically so overall I think
the anastacio packaging is actually a
little bit more of a favorite for me I
do like that you do get the dual sided
brush in here I don't have my in there
these guys again I'm not a huge fan of
the brush but if I were to travel I
think I would take this eyeshadow
palette I don't know why I just kind of
like this a little more I feel like it's
really compact and it would fit into my
purse nicely not to say that the Holy
Grail I shadow palette wouldn't because
this thing is sleek as hell as you guys
can see is super thin
you still get a mirror and you're
getting even more shades in here you're
getting what five or six more shades in
here so you technically are getting more
in this palette but I think for travel I
would go with the anastacio plus he gets
like like I said you do get the mirror
and you get that little dual and did
brush but for the most part I think
pigmentation is the same on these two
palettes I would say the violet boss
definitely is a little more softer it's
a little more blendable I like the
formulation a little more now just for
background I don't love blending my
eyeshadows out if you guys have been
watching my channel for a while I don't
like when products are hard to blend out
on the eye and I am NOT in any way shape
or form saying that this formulation is
hard to blend this is like butter it
blends so quickly but for some reason
the viola boss ones just are quicker
they're quicker for me and I have to say
I do like the selection in here they're
kind of like mustardy tones over here I
prefer them for transition shades over
the ones that are in the modern
renaissance palette what I really like
about the two of these palettes is that
they do include those kind of yellowy
mustardy tones here which make really
really beautiful transition shades
especially when you are working with
like warmer
homes like the shades down here but
overall if I have to pick one I'm just
gonna tell you guys right away I would
go with the Holy Grail eyes shadow
palette this is still my favorite for
ten dollars more you are getting more
product in here you are almost getting
three times the amount of shadow in each
pan than you are with this particular
palette and I just prefer this overall I
think the formulation on this is a lot
better let me go ahead and swatch a few
shades here so here's like one of the
foiled eyeshadows from the Holy Grail
palette this is called cranberry splash
and then I will go ahead and swatch one
of the sort of foil E or luster shades
in the modern renaissance palettes that
this is Primavera they both feel very
very similar and they feel so like
decadent and wonderful on my finger but
for some reason the Holy Grail palette
just has a little more umph to it so
here we have the Holy Grail eyes shadow
palettes watched as you guys can see
that foiled shade has no skipping it's
beautiful super pigmented super super
opaque again this is a lighter shade but
there's a little tiny bit of skipping
there nothing crazy
it still is super shiny and beautiful on
the lid but it's not nearly as opaque
and again I'm one of those people I
really don't like to spend a huge amount
of time on my eyeshadow and I can just
go over my lid with like this color
right here latte I can just go over my
lid like with a brush or even just tap
this on with my finger and it's like BAM
in your face super foil beautiful I
don't have to go back to it with a brush
I feel like sometimes with this
particular eyeshadow palette especially
like Vermeer and Primavera those are
beautiful lid colors I do have to build
them up a little more so I think if you
are someone like me and you like to do
your makeup really really quickly you
want that gorgeous sort of very smoky
eye I think you should go for the Holy
Grail palette again you are getting
triple the amount of product in here for
only $10 more it is a little bit of a
pain you do have to go on to the Holy
Grail weightless basically and they only
ship out maybe like I think like 60 of
these a month so you do have to kind of
wait a little longer if you do want a
palette right away and you just can't
wait you want to play around with these
colors and go ahead and get the
Anastacio one like I said the
formulation is very very similar they
are both absolutely stunning palettes I
don't think you need both but if you do
want to pick one I would hide
recommend checking out the Holy Grail
there's just something magical about the
formulation on the violet fossae shadows
now I do want to touch on the topic
really quickly by the boss doesn't
exactly use the best ingredients in
their eyeshadows if you are very very
sensitive to talc and to mica you might
want to stay away from this because
those are like the first two ingredients
in this particular eyeshadow palette now
for the Anasazi of Beverly Hills those
particular ingredients mica is the first
ingredient but help doesn't come along
until much later in the actual palette
like on the ingredients list if that
makes sense so I do feel like if you are
very sensitive these might be better
shadows overall for you to kind of play
with like if you have very sensitive
eyes whereas these ones are kind of
similar and they have the same sort of
formulation as I don't want to say
formulation because I don't even love
more if the eyeshadows but they have the
same sort of ingredients list as marthy
eyeshadows if you kind of catch my drift
so they are filled with a lot of fillers
and things like that which would make
sense because I mean look at these
colors like obviously you know take it
this kind of pigmentation to get these
kind of colors to get them so smooth and
have them glide on so beautifully you
are using a lot of fillers because they
have a lot of tobacco color and things
like that in them so I just wanted to
say if you are a little more sensitive
you have sensitive eyes I would kind of
lean more towards the Anastacio modern
renaissance talent love that they have
that ingredients listed on the back
there I think that really shows a lot by
the boss does not have an ingredient
list just for reference now let's talk
about Oh animal testing I want to touch
on that really quickly I don't think
that Anastacio Beverly Hills animal test
I believe down in the description bar if
I find out if they do or not but I do
know that by Lovaas is a cruelty-free
brand so I just want to touch on that as
well so overall I think they are both
beautiful beautiful palettes they have
the same sort of cranberry gorgeous
gorgeous Ness I don't even know how to
describe them just gorgeous tones in
there they really look like beautiful
fall palettes I think they are
absolutely stunning but if I personally
had to pick one I would go with the holy
grail eyes shadow palette I love the
formulation I love the blend ability I
like the color selection I like that you
get triple the amount of product and I
like the price on it so
yeah those are the two little eyeshadow
palettes here I hope I answered any
questions you may have had if you would
like a separate video of me swatching
everything out let me know down below
and I can make that and yeah I will see
you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
