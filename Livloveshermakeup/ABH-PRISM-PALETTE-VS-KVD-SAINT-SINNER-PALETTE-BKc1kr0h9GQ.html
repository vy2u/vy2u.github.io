my channel happy Tuesday I know I said
yesterday happy Tuesday in my video
apparently I didn't realize it was
Monday
unfortunately Monday but today it is
actually Tuesday and today I have a
comparison video to share with you guys
now recently I've been getting so many
questions about the honesty of Beverly
Hills prison pilot I tried to do a full
review swatches comparison for you guys
on this palette I wasn't able to get
that video up I corrupted the footage by
accident so I did a livestream about a
week ago kind of walking through in the
actual palette with you guys been
talking just a little bit about it every
time I'm on a livestream honestly I get
carried away with other things so I
started blogging about different stuff
but I tried to do a quick little
comparison for you guys against the cap
on decent and center palette and I
thought today we would just go more in
depth and that way I can give you guys
my thoughts on this palette but I also
talked about this baby because these are
two pallets that a lot of people are
noticing hey those look pretty similar
and I want to know which one to get so
let's go ahead and start with the a BH
prism palette if this does retail for
$42 you can get it on at these two 4.com
website as well as the AMA Stassi at
Beverly Hills comm website it is a
limited edition and this does include 14
different shadows inside of here you are
getting two duochrome so you are getting
seven ultra mats that's well as five
metallic finishes you do also receive a
double ended brush one side has a little
more of like a blending side and then
one side is kind of like a flat smudger
sort of brush or for packing the lid
color really whatever the you want
it to be kind of brush as all brushes
are and then it's just the typical brush
that you usually get in these palettes I
took mine out already because it's not
something that really excites me that
much but that is the honest talk to you
beverly hills prison palette over here
we have the kat von d saint and sinner
palette - this retails for $62 it is a
limited edition for holiday 2017 just
like the Anastasio Beverly Hills Prison
palette and this one however does
include a 24 different shades inside of
here you are getting three different
finishes throughout the entire palette
you're getting metallics maps and they
say glitter in few shadows as well so
let's talk a little bit about what they
have in common what I would say that
these two palettes have in common is
definitely quality as well as color
selection a lot of people are noticing
not only the packaging is black and gold
and gorgeous but
these did to have these really gorgeous
jewel tones at them and I have to say
overall there are definitely some
overlapping shades in here it's not
anything that's like oh my god that's an
exact dupe some of them when I do insert
the swatches here for you guys to see
some of them you'll see oh my goodness
yes those are exact dupes but the
majority of them are just very very
close and similar if you got these up to
the eyes would you really be able to
tell a difference probably not so you
can see this one over here definitely
has a lot of bright bold colors you have
cool tones you have warm tones and see
it goes from the Anasazi of Beverly
Hills person palette it's just a really
really interesting color selection I
know a lot of people have been asking me
is this similar to the subculture
palette I feel like it is I know a lot
of people have been saying it's not it's
not it's a different palette and this
paired together because subculture is
great because the subculture has a lot
of mattes in it this guy has a lot of
metallic finishes and I feel like it is
a little bit of a supplementary a
palette but anyway I'm gonna go ahead
and insert to some swatches for you guys
so we can compare side-by-side some of
these shades I want to say really
quickly these were taking the natural
lighting I just feel like that is the
best way for you guys to see that we
will go ahead and start with the honest
toffee of Beverly Hills Saturn shade on
top and on the bottom but we have the
shade devil from the D cap on D Saint
and sinner palette now you guys can see
it Saturn although in a pan it does look
like it's a little more orange E tone
when you can see the Squatch you can see
it definitely has a little more red
tones running through it now devil on
the other hand really does have those
true orange shades so those are
definitely shades that I feel like are
similar they both swatch beautifully
they both go on to the skin beautifully
they go on to the eyes beautifully very
soft very buttery really enjoy the two
of those up next let's talk about those
bright green shades in these palettes I
feel like that is definitely a trend
right now so over here we have the shade
a sphere and then over here we have the
shade Exodus now Exodus is on the bottom
and this one does have a little more
glitter infused particles into it
whereas a sphere is a true matte color
but you guys can see the difference fear
definitely leans a little more on like
the piss yellow side whereas Exodus is
definitely a true green with a little
bit of a goldish shimmer all right up
next we i swatched out the two blacks
for you guys we have obsidian as well as
the shade of Sabbath now I don't think
that either of these are that front
when it comes to Matt to blacks I feel
like the best Matt black that I've ever
tried out is from makeup geek it's
called corrupt anyway I do feel like
Sabbath actually it feels better to the
touch very very smooth and silky which
is interesting because normally Kat Von
D and matte shadows are a little crispy
and hard to blend and hard to the touch
but I do like the way that one goes on
however I prefer the way of sitting and
blends out on the eye I'm not the one
who uses a lot of black shadow I know a
lot of people do that for like liner and
stuff I don't do a lot of liner so I
just wanted to go ahead and show those
two swatches cuz they're practically
identical and next up we have thrown
from a BH on top and then on the bottom
we have a vestment from the kat von d
palette now you guys can see these are
very very very similar I can say the a
BH has just a little more pigment to it
and definitely a little more of a
metallic sort of duo chromatic vibe you
definitely can see a true color shift
from like a brown to a turquoise when
you do turn your arm or when you turn
your eyes so really really beautiful up
next we have my favorite shades from
both of these palettes this one right
here is called dimension we have to
mention from the abh palette on top and
on the bottom but we have this gorgeous
shade right here called cathedral from
the saint and sinner palette i love
these kind of shades it's like a
beautiful muted lilac color but i do
have to say i do prefer it and this one
right here dimension and the reason for
that is because it actually has a baby
pink shift to it and it's just
absolutely beautiful these are gorgeous
all over tapped all over the lid but as
you guys can see very very similar are
you gonna be able to tell a difference
when those are on the actual I probably
not but yeah those are my favorite
shades from each palette and then I
wanted to go ahead and swatch out some
of the mattes for you guys here we have
parallel on top from the a BH palette
and then I did go ahead and just watch
how crucifix for you guys this is one of
my least favorite shades from the
palette I have it on my eyes today it's
very very difficult to blend it as you
can see crucifix is like a true smoky
dark chocolate brown it looks like it's
more of like a muted Brown in the pan
but once you get it on to the actual
skin or on to the eye anywhere that you
have skin it definitely looks like it is
a little more of like a deeper kind of
you know blackish brown color like the
deepest smoky as a brown color you could
ever get and then
and next I wanted to go ahead and swatch
how pyramid and then I wanted to swatch
that next to this guy right here which
is called a relic relic really looks
like a true true
yellow gold but I feel like once you get
it onto the skin it has a little more of
like greenish tones or vibes but again
could you be able to tell the difference
between those two shades on your lid
probably not unless you have someone
really really up close to your face and
then finally I wanted to go ahead and
swatch out one of my favorite shades
called Eden from the APH palette and I
went ahead and swatch that next to
Sacred Heart from the cap on D palette
now Sacred Heart is more of a metallic
finish and it obviously is a little
deeper in tone but very very similar
color so as far as that is concerned I
feel like something that they definitely
have in common is color selection you
absolutely don't need a both of these
palettes they have beautiful beautiful
bright colors they have cool tones they
have warm tones a really nice mixture of
a lot of things so that is the first
thing that they definitely have in
common
another thing I feel like if these
palettes have in common is just overall
quality you can't put either of these
palettes on your eyes and say oh that's
some shitty quality right there no these
are absolutely really really beautiful
quality they are good shadows they are
well made I can tell just from using
them I have a lot of shadows in my
collection and these are both very very
good palettes alright let's go ahead and
talk about what they do not have in
common the first is definitely just
finishes when it comes to the a BH
palette and there are so many dual
chromatic and just metallic finishes in
here it is definitely a supplementary
palette so what I don't really love
about this is the fact that I do have to
usually work in another palette this
shade right here which is called unity
it looks like it might be a nice
transition shade or an all-over lid
shade it's way too dark even for me when
I'm self tan so I usually do use that as
a transition but it truly is like this
weird kind of yellowy color it looks a
little lighter in the pan and then it
goes onto the skin a little darker now
when it comes to like Eden and Saturn
and those are absolutely fantastic
however the one thing that I feel like
this palette is missing it's a really
nice cool toned and matte shade because
as you guys can see a lot of the
metallic and a lot of the tool chromatic
shades in here do lean a little more on
the cold tone side so I find myself
reaching for another palette to pull in
when it comes to this guy and you
I've been reaching for the subculture
because like I said the subculture has
more mats that this has more metallic
kind of finishes now when it comes to
the Kat Von D I feel like this is
overall one of those palettes that is
just a little better because I do feel
like it's a one-stop shop you may look
at it and be a little confused but keep
in mind they have the same side and then
the center side if you were to go ahead
and arrange these shadows in a different
way you would understand okay there's my
brow bone shape there's two brow bone
shades in here there's a multitude of
mattes I mean the Matteson you're a
great you have martyr you have
definitely of a menu of crucifix you
have baptism exorcism you have products
here that you could work in as a
transition you have products here for
your brow bone and this is actually a
one-stop palettes even though it may not
look like it so I do feel like the
finishes really say a lot about the
palettes I wish there were more than
that than this guy just kind of have
like I wish there were more shimmers
when it came to it the subculture
palette of course they just wanted to do
something a little differently like I
said this pairs beautifully together
with these subculture palettes but it is
not really a one-stop shop kind of
palette for me personally so that's
something that they do not have in
common and then also I think the final
thing we should talk about is just the
overall palette size so if the kat von d
palette is obviously it's just a really
really beautiful thing that you would
probably like feature on a shelf and
you're finding a beauty room which is
what I'm going to do and this is
gorgeous but it's huge you are
not going to take this traveling with
you because it's not going to fit it's
just not realistic whereas I feel like
the honest usnea Beverly Hills palette
is very compact it's beautiful and I
haven't noticed that any of these are
too powdery to the point where they're
going to shatter if you guys are curious
I do feel like this formula in here the
maps in here are very similar to the
modern or Renaissance matte so they
definitely don't remind me of the
subculture formula if you're worried
about kick up and all that kind of stuff
and this is definitely a lot of
difference but you guys can see right
here I mean these duochrome some
metallics really have that kind of
spongy squishy feel to them and that's
not gonna be everybody's cup of tea I
feel like I have to go in with my finger
and kind of Pat those on and you know
there's just there's just
thanks about this palette that like I'm
like it's okay it's okay but I
definitely do prefer the cap on D st.
and Center so overall I feel like I'm
associate Beverly Hills is the best for
those of you who want to travel with a
palette like this it is really and you
know if you really enjoy it
mattes and metallics but mostly metallic
and dual chrome shades you're going to
love this palette as long as you have
another basic palette that you can work
in with this guy for a brow bone for a
transition you're gonna love this you're
absolutely going to love this palette I
feel like the Kat Von D is best for
those of you who do want more like a
collector's item and also a mixture of
bold and neutral and basically
everything in between sort of shades
this is a one-stop fits all sort of
palette even though it may not look like
it you have your brow bone shade you do
have your cruciate you have everything
and here you have a nice assortment of
mattes and glitters and also metallics
so this is really kind of like a
one-stop shop sort of palette so overall
you guys I'm gonna give this a 3 out of
5 stars the abh person palette and I am
going to go ahead and give the cap on D
four stars I really think this is a
fantastic palette like I said it can be
a little more difficult to blend the
mattes in the a pH palette are
definitely easier
however there's just not a lot of mattes
in here and I'm not someone who has
enough talent to blend a duochrome or a
 shimmer into my crease I just
can't do it I can smoke it out on my
lower lash line I can tap it onto my lid
but there's only a certain amount of
looks you can get with this guy so I
hope this comparison was helpful let me
know down below which one you're gonna
pick up and I guess I will see you guys
my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
