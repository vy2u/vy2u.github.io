channel today I have my review and a
little bit of a mini rant for you guys
on the new Anasazi of Beverly Hills
subculture palette I did purchase it for
forty two dollars on the Anasazi of
Beverly Hills comm website unfortunately
it is currently out of stock but you can
also pick it up on these sephora.com
website as well as the Ulta dot-com
website currently for the same exact
price I'll go ahead and link that down
below in the description bar if you
would like to pick this baby up it is
not necessarily a link it will just take
you directly to the website so inside of
here you are getting 14 different
eyeshadows two of which are duochrome
finishes one is more of a foiled or
shimmer and the rest are matte or like
they're calling them super matter ultra
matte there AKA age was basically press
pigments in my opinion i just feel like
they're super super super intensely
pigmented so i would consider them a
press statement this particular palette
was made in the United States of America
and the brush was assembled in the
People's Republic of China if you are
curious so this how it was made in the
US this was made in China this does make
it cruelty free unfortunately not vegan
carmine is listed in the ingredients
list on the back here and if you are
curious carmine is crushed to be told
now that isn't a lot of different
eyeshadow palettes all over so not
anything that's really new oh but yes
it's not vegan now the first thing I
want to say really quickly and my little
rant or my little roast here is more
directed just towards anasazi Beverly
Hills not so much the palette I actually
really enjoyed my palette I'm not going
to be returning it I'm having a good
time with it if you're curious and the
batch number that I have here is the p7
batch which I heard that it supposed to
be a good batch and I know a lot of
people say batches don't mean anything
but I'm a true believer that makeup is
created differently not everything can
be perfect and exact all the time so for
me personally I really think that this
was a really big sale when it comes to
marketing I do not think that they
marketed this palette very well I know
that they have that belief which really
is a shame but at the same time they're
saying that this is the sister palette
to be modern a Renaissance know this is
a talent that has a huge following
people are obsessed with this is the
holy grail for a whole lot of
people so if you are saying that this is
going to be a sister or a twin or a
freaking distant cousin it better be the
same formula or else people are going to
freak out you would think that honest
tapia Beverly Hills would understand
that one thing I have noticed with on a
Sofia Beverly hold over and over and
time and time again is that they really
love to change their formulas if you
look at the honest selfie
we hope it's the majority of them are
different formulas I don't know why they
do this they've gotten very very lucky
when it comes to a lot of their products
that they still work just as well but
this is something that I feel like I
need to call them out on because I'm
honestly getting a little sick of it
especially now as the subculture is just
not as good as a sister if that makes
sense so I feel like a lot of people are
making a really really big deal about
the talent we are of course comparing it
to the modern of Renaissance if you
compare this to other palettes other
palettes in my collection don't have
nearly as much pigmented this blends
better than a lot of other palettes in
my collection but unfortunately when you
market it as a sister or a twin or
whatever a distant cousin relative
whatever to this particular palette
right here and it's not the same that is
going to be a big no-no for a lot of
people so that is what consumers are so
mad at you on associate Beverly Hills
it's not necessarily that this is such a
piece of some people are really
trying hard to hate this let me tell you
I've seen people like freaking cave out
zukar bat cave out carve out you know
the shadows in here and I think that's
ridiculous you're just trying to get
more views on videos and blah blah blah
whatever it's fine like all youtubers
are trying to do that but it really is
one of those things where I think it's
important that we mention the fact that
the appellate isn't necessarily that bad
it's just the fact that we're comparing
it to the first guy over here the modern
Renaissance this is what you promised
you said it was the same he said it's
just as buttery just as pigmented and
then you go on Twitter nor vina went on
Twitter and she was saying oh yeah you
know I'm going to be going ahead and
pressing the shadows a little firmer
well that makes people think you're
going to be reformulating and then she
just now said we're not reformulating so
for me it was just basically the
marketing of this this was an utter fail
and it makes me kind of looked a little
bit down on honest sake Beverly Hills
they are definitely a brand that I'm
pretty damn foil to I'm not going to lie
a lot of their stuff is really really
good but one thing I had to say was that
I have noticed that they have been
changing up formulas a lot recently and
you know this is what happened
you know you changed up the formula you
thought you were doing better and
unfortunately it was worse so this is my
little roast towards Anasazi Beverly
Hills I don't think the palette is that
bad let's go ahead and talk a little
more about the palette as far as color
selection and pigmentation is concerned
this is amazing it's beautiful the
pigmentation is insane there is
such a thing as having too much of one
thing and I
like this is too pigmented so for me
personally I think going in with really
really densely packed brushes and really
tapping off the excess I feel like if I
go in with a fluffy brush with this
particular palette I get shadows all
over my face now I do believe that you
shouldn't have to change up your
techniques when you're using an
eyeshadow palette but you should be able
to change up your brushes you should
have more than four or five brushes in
your collection so that you can work
with spoiled shades or foil
consistencies you can work with masks
you can work with all sorts of different
duochrome and all that kind of stuff but
unfortunately as you feel like the
pigmentation is just a little too and
thing when it comes to them and you guys
are going to see that when we do live
swatches as far as the color selection
is concerned it really does pair nicely
together with the modern renaissance but
it would be even better if they were
matching formulas so it is a little
irritating because they do go together
beautifully I remember no nor be nothing
on Instagram and that like these are the
only 2 palette she needs in her
collection and I agree today I have on a
very neutral eye look and i created it
with this palette when you look at this
you wouldn't think that you would be
able to do that but you can so today i
have on slide just smoked out on my
lower lashline
I took adorn all over on my lid which is
one of those more foiled shades and then
I took all star in my crease I like the
way it came out it is a palette it takes
a little more time and effort to blend
out but I have a lot of palettes in my
collection that I would put into the
category of being time-consuming in fact
I have a video all about it which I'll
go ahead and throw up in the card so as
far as color selection and a
pigmentation is concerned
absolutely phenomenal maybe a little too
much pigment going on here I think she
just wanted to ultra perfected and she
went too far with pigmentation instead
of blend ability so now next let's talk
about actual blending and what brushes
to you so I really have been enjoying on
my morphe brushes with this now I will
be doing a video on Wednesday talking
all about what I like and don't like
about the morphe brand I do like their
brushes I just hate their makeup so the
two brushes I've been reaching for are
the m4 4-1 and m5 11 so what I really
like about these is that they're a
little on the scratchy side they don't
have too much give to them so you can
kind of pull them like this and you
won't see that they'll flatten out one
of the things about this particular
subculture palette is if you take a
really really fluffy brush and you try
and blend these all over the place
they're going to go everywhere you're
going to have kick up the lower it's
going to be a mess I also do
notice that I get fallout if I use
something too fluffy I
absolutely no follow if I use brushes
like this now as far as the double-ended
brush is concerned that comes with the
palette and this kind is super scratchy
and dense and it makes me wonder if like
they kind of do that you know they were
like hey we're doing this really really
soft formula we should have a little
more of a crispy brush I did use this to
kind of just blend out the lower
lashline color today and I mean I feel
scratching horrible I really don't like
it but I did use the flat shader side it
actually applied the color and I like
this has a nice soft synthetic a
bristles so I do think when it comes to
what brushes you need something a little
more densely packed like I said you
shouldn't have to change up your actual
technique for applying makeup just
because a palette is a little different
but I do think that you should have a
multitude of brushes in your collection
if you want to work with different
eyeshadow palettes
now with that being said do I not
believe these other youtubers talking
about how oh my god I hit pan this isn't
working for me of course I believe them
I think there are bad batches going out
which again it's really really
disappointing because honestly Beverly
Hills is one of those brands that is so
consistent and I'd hate to see that I'd
hate to see that some people are getting
palettes with no brushes in them some
people are getting talus and everything
shattered in here and nothing's packaged
well I mean that makes me really really
sad because on a saucy Beverly Hills is
such a great brand but it's just
something that I feel like they're going
to need to work on they're going to have
to learn their lesson this time and
hopefully the next palette will be
better all right as far as where time is
concerned you guys I think it's pretty
darn good because they are so pigmented
they really do stick on the eyes all day
I have two different primers I have
tried this palette with the first one
being my all-time favorite the
Maybelline master pine from the
drugstore so this is in the lightest
shade I believe it's called 505 or 510
it is domestic home base which I really
like because these are a little more
difficult to blend especially because
they're those darker smokey shades you
have to be really really careful if you
go in with like a glitter glue just
because you have a lot of kick up
doesn't mean they have a ton of fallout
so don't get twisted okay if you go
in with a glitter glue you're going to
be blending forever even with these two
primers right here I still have to blend
like I look like this for 10 to 12
minutes which is a long time for me so
that's the first eyeshadow primer the
second one is the Urban Decay anti-aging
eyeshadow primer potion potion again
this is a domestic o-net base and I have
the same sort of issue they definitely
have a harder time blending but I'm
really happy with the eye looks
come out with so I would put this into
the category of being time-consuming
horrible if you have to actually change
up your technique but I would say yes
you need a ball titude of different
brushes for this particular palette some
of these are a little more firmly press
like cube and electorate which are the
duochrome
adorned is very very tricky you have to
use your finger to literally get that
onto the lid without it chunking up I
mean it's kind of weird and then the
matte like I said you just got to spend
the time so if you're not willing to do
that if you hate this palette absolutely
return it it's not meant for you that's
totally fine but if you do want to put
the extra time and effort in I think
that it is a decent palette I think a
lot of people are making a much bigger
deal out of this than it should be but
like I said I think the Anasazi of over
Leos also do not look at this very well
so now let's go ahead and get into some
live swatches I'm going to start with
cube so cube is B duochrome and this one
is basically a opalescent cool toned
white with a little bit of a pink shift
like I said I don't like the formula on
the duo chrome so if you're like these
are super firmly press honestly at this
color right here reminds me as pink
cards from the Anasazi Azure we hold
moonchild glow kit but unfortunately
this is like the bad version you have to
actually foil the duo crowns which I
find a really really annoying and then I
do notice I got like a little bit of
hard pan from even foiling it so I
wasn't a huge fan of that but the
mappings are so pigmented actually do
have a dawn so this is a mask transition
shade and it is I mean you guys are
going to see the pigment level on here
it's insane I mean if we were just
judging a palace on pigment this one
would take the win you know what I mean
like she put so much time clearly Norby
no put so much time into pigment but
sometimes that's not what it's about
sometimes having it stuff this really
pigmented is not actually a good thing
so the next one racer is called destiny
it's like a muddy kind of greenish army
color I really like it it's super pretty
and again they do you think Suzy can
look really pretty on the eyes you just
have to put that extra time in but if
they were just a little less pigmented I
think it would have been better I can't
even believe I'm saying that but
sometimes I say that people are like are
you crazy but it's true you guys know
what I need sometimes it's just true
it's too much be good all right next we
do have adorn and adorn is definitely a
little more on the chunky side it is a
true kind of foiled consistency and I'll
just go ahead and show you guys that
right there you can see it is kicking up
a little bit like I said I have
pack this on with my finger and I go
back in fourths so again it's very
time-consuming if you don't want to put
this effort in you don't have to a lot
of people are saying you shouldn't have
to I have a lot of palettes where I feel
like I do have to try different
techniques like for my lorac Pro palette
I have to use certain brushes I have to
use certain techniques I have to foil my
shades but I'm okay with that because I
love that I look that I guess that is
how I feel about this particular palette
but don't feel like you need it if you
ask you we don't want to put that extra
time and you shouldn't have to and you
don't have to next we do have all-star
which is that beautiful Bobby kind of
shade that I do have in my crease today
I've got a little more of a red
undertone and incredibly incredibly
pigmented maybe a little more firmly
pressed but these are all very very soft
except for the duo crumbs in my opinion
all right the next one that we have here
is called mercury and everyone would say
this one was really really hard for them
to blend it's not too hard for me to
blend it's just like a muted kind of
gray color have a little bit of a
greenish undertone which you can't
really see unless you really really
build it up but there it is there is
mercury the next one that we have you're
the last one on the top row is called
access this is that gorgeous gorgeous
darks like turquoise sort of color and
this guy can definitely be difficult to
blend I like to put it on the lower lash
line as well as smoke it out kind of in
the outer V but look at that
pigmentation look at that now this one
right here is definitely the biggest you
know the biggest offender of changing
colors so one of the things about this
particular formula as well which a lot
of people are not going to like it the
fact that they do oxidize some of these
shades not all of them not all of them
but some of them do offset eyes so
access is one of those that goes on
turquoise and then throughout the day
terms it's like an icy gray blue color
which I smell into I love me some cool
tone shades but this shouldn't be
happening that technically shouldn't be
happening so that's just something to be
aware of
Rowdy also does back and then what is
the other one edge the yellow shade the
rest of them aren't horrible they're not
amazing but there is a little bit of
oxidation that occurs and honestly I've
never had that with a palette all right
here is this beautiful shade right here
which is called Roxy it's a nice kind of
salmon at peachy tone I don't layers
have a little bit of difficulty blending
this mostly just because of the
pigmentation level but if I put the time
and effort ineffectually really really
pretty here together with your modern
renaissance colors because it
and Renaissance colors obviously have
those more warm tones in there next we
do have the other duochrome which I
really wanted to love this one right
here is called electric if it was a
little more pigmented it would be
excellent again as the shade selection
here is great he's also torn like can
you guys tell it's just one of those
things where you're so torn
about a pallet it's like how can it be
like this how could it be like this
alright next would you have fudge this
is what I have on my lower lash line
today it is a mass and it's just a
really nice chocolatey brown color and
the leaves they do have this in single
form as well that you've been purchased
from the Anastasio Beverly hosts calm
website so there is such next we do have
a new wave and now this one is actually
really really pretty I know a lot of
people were saying this one oxidizers on
them for me it doesn't at all I love it
it's like a deep a mustard sort of color
so there is new wave alright the next
one that we have here is called on canes
this one is just a step Oh lighter than
Access in my opinion and it is really
really beautiful so that is what it
looks like there is untamed when you do
blend on canes and access together you
can't tell that much of a difference
because like I said this one oxidizes
basically into that shade right there so
just want to give you guys a heads up we
do have edge which is that yellow color
this one definitely oxidizes and changes
into kind of like a green color on my
eyes personally so there it is and then
the final sheet that we have in the
palette you guys is Rowdy like I said
this one does also oxidize a little bit
and it is harder to the ledge so anyone
can see I mean the pigmentation level is
crazy I do think people are making a
bigger deal out of this than it should
be compared to other palettes in my
collection yes there are a few things
that I've definitely nitpicky with when
it comes to this but I'm not going to
return it because I love the shade
selection I love that I can get all
these colors in one palette but it is
definitely a shame that honest toffee
Beverly Hills marketed this the way that
they did I really think they made a huge
mistake and this is going to take a big
toll on their brand in my opinion I'm
not going to stop purchasing from that I
still think they have wonderful products
but I have to say one thing I'm noticing
with them and they have this trend of
wanting to reformulate products that are
already good so just just stop
please stop doing that okay because you
already have good stuff pigmentation now
you guys can see so who is this for this
is for someone who wants to spend wants
to spend who is willing to spend a long
time on their eyeshadow if you are
willing to foil some of these shades and
work with them and you know really dig
in with the duochrome and get the right
kind of brushes you're going to like
this palette you're going to be able to
create looks that you're happy with it's
just such a beautiful color selection
it's so diverse it's so different is
going to work for all sorts of different
skin tones but if you're someone who is
more one-and-done like I am on a daily
basis it's not going to be the palette
for you this will not be something that
I reach for very often this is going to
be for special events special occasions
probably when I'm on stage and a
professional flutist I'd probably pop a
few colors you know in my crease or
whatever like I said the oxidation it
starts to happen throughout the day so
if I was on stage for two hours and I
wanted to take access in my crease I'm
sure it would stay that turquoise color
but yeah it's a little difficult I'm
very much torn with this palette I feel
like like I said the marketing was just
really bad with this but it's still
super pigmented you can tell they put
the effort in the ingredient list is
actually not that bad but it's just one
of those things that kind of fell
through so what I would recommend to you
guys is going in store swatching scene
if it's something you want to play with
these are very unique colors I can see
why people would want this in their
collection but please understand it is
not the same formula as a modern
renaissance so anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed this review thank you for
joining me I'm sorry such a long video I
had a lot to say but yes that's pretty
much it I guess I will see you guys
tomorrow right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
