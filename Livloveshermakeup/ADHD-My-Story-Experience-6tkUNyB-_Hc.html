hope you guys are having a good day this
is going to be a well I'm gonna film a
few videos today but this is gonna be
the first one it's gonna go in my
helpful chats playlist which is just
literally most of the time me just
sitting there with no makeup on talking
about life issues problems things you
can deal with how to deal with them how
I deal with them things like that or
just me sitting there and ranting about
issues I don't know but um I got a
really interesting message the other day
and I thought you know what maybe I
should make a video on it um somebody
wrote to me and asked me if I would do a
video talking about ADHD that didn't
come out right
88 ADHD wow I just like stammered um I
thought it was really funny because
first of all disclaimer I do have ADHD
um I didn't really know that it was
completely obvious people always tell me
you know you're very bubbly and bright
and uplifting but that doesn't always
mean like oh she has ADHD but I just
thought it was so funny that this person
who recently subscribed to me literally
said that they watched maybe two or
three videos and they asked me so kindly
to you know it wasn't in a mean way like
you have ADHD they were just like I hope
you really love if you would make a
video on this and I was like no so it's
one of those things where it's like
maybe some people can tell you know I'm
just kind of a hyper person I just have
that kind of energy it's just who I am
and even with my medications which yes I
am on medications I have been since I
was five years old I was diagnosed when
I was five years old by the way um but
anyway Here I am
ADHD getting all off in different areas
topics but yeah so I am one of those
people that is attention deficit hyper
disorder and it is one of those things
that really affects a lot a lot of
people and it's something that you know
a lot of people do say that they get
like diagnosed later in life which I do
believe but usually in most cases it's
pretty visible and you
see it right away or your parents
usually see it right away I was just off
the wall crazy and hyper when I was
young as they brought me my parents
brought me in for testing when I was
five and they were like she's definitely
ADHD so the difference between a DD and
ADHD is a DD is attention deficit
disorder which is more like issues with
concentrating and like getting work done
like having enough focus to go through
with things ADHD is a little different
it's basically attention deficit hyper
disorder so it's one of those things
where you are a hyper person I always
always always and moving some part of my
body and just all over the place I can't
help it even with my meds I'm just I'm
constantly moving uh you know as I sit
here right now I'm looking down at my
foot which is one dude so it's just one
of those things I think that there's a
big difference between a DD and ADHD
because as someone who has ADHD myself
I've never really had issues like
following through with something I find
that people with a DD do have issues
with that it's more that I just get
completely completely like separated
from the thought that I'm on so I'll be
sitting there thinking about something
else and then I have like channels going
off and what I mean by that is I
describe my ADHD as having like being
like a television and that there are
always always at least 50 different
channels plain I am thinking about tons
of different things at once
I just can't always focus on one
specific thing so I do notice that you
know I get things done
I have motivation you know that's not an
issue I find that that is with people
with a DD but you need to be careful if
you do think you have a DD or ADHD
definitely you need to go get tested and
let a specialist figure it out for you
and I'll get into this in the in a
little bit but definitely if you don't
have a DD or ADHD
it's just insulting for you to try and
go and get medications that are not
meant for your body that could really
really hurt you and also it's insulting
for people to come up and ask someone
will you sell me some of your
medications or things like that I just
put that out there the most common drug
for ADHD is a stimulant medication
called adderall there's also five hands
there's a few different things but it's
all in the and feta mean cat like family
and you're thinking probably
methamphetamine yes they come from like
almost the same I don't want to see like
Oh methods the same as adderall but they
come from almost the same you know
family that amphetamine family it is a
very very strong stimulant medication
and the reason that it works for people
with a DD not what I have but a DD is
because they lack motivation and so when
they take it they get motivated and they
can seek things through until the end
they can finish projects for ADHD it
actually has the opposite effect this is
one of those things where I do have
motivation and I can get things done
however like I said I'll be saying that
and I'll just go back that shiny thing
or like you know I get so distracted so
it's one of those things where the
medication that I currently take the
amphetamines are good for ADHD because
it actually has an opposite effect on
you it actually calms you down and I
know that's crazy you're probably
watching this video right now thinking
did you take your meds yet I did so this
is me with my meds I'm sure you guys can
imagine how I am when I wake up in the
morning I literally fly out of bed
that's probably why I'm a morning person
I'm rarely tired I would say I start to
feel more tired when I take my
medications I'm one of those people that
just if I didn't take my meds I probably
could not sleep for days at a time this
was why it was really important that you
know I was put on this specific
medication um I will let you guys know I
am on vyvanse I used to take adderall
and I've also taken strattera which is a
non stimulant medication um the
non-stimulant did not work for me I
think it tends to be a little better for
people who have a TD like I said big
difference between a TD and ADHD so for
me personally it didn't work
vyvanse has been what works the best for
me because it lasts all day long which
is great it doesn't wear off and I find
that if I
when I was taking adderall it wore off
towards the end of the day and I could
not sleep and it wasn't because I
couldn't sleep because I was hyper from
the medication like I told you it has an
opposite effect on actual people with
hyperactivity but it I woke up because
the medication wore off and I was hyper
again so there was actually a point
where I was taking adderall three times
a day and one was right before bed so
and you may be seen there thinking oh my
gosh why you know because a lot of I'm
gonna just go ahead and say it I'm in
college and I know a lot of people who
take this medication who do not need it
and if you take it and you get high off
of it
you obviously do not have ADHD I have
never once taken it and felt euphoric or
high off of it if anything it makes me
feel calm I can kind of turn off some of
those channels in my brain I'm not
thinking of 20 different things at once
and I can actually like relax and kind
of like just do what normal people do I
still do have a very high energy level
however that's just part of who I am and
that's going to be part of who I am and
so yeah um but anyway so I'm kind of
getting in depth about the whole thing
and sharing with you guys just because
this question and this person asked me
about it it was really interesting and I
kind of wanted to give you a perspective
on someone who you know was diagnosed at
a very young age and also someone who is
in college and sees people who take this
medication all the time who don't
actually need it I will say I believe it
is a felony if you take it and you don't
need it if you don't have a prescription
for it if you're selling it I'm telling
you right now I'm in college it's not
cool don't do it it's not cool some
people actually need it I am literally
bouncing off the wall if I don't take it
so it's just kind of it's one of those
things worth like why would you do that
you know and I understand people want to
get high and stuff like that but um it
can actually be very damaging for people
who don't need it to you can go into
like a cardiac arrest you you have to be
very careful I just wanted to say that
because I know a lot of people I have
then do this and I'm so against it I
find it insulting and honestly it can be
very very you know unhealthy and bad for
you mostly because it's such an
addictive drug it's in that class family
of the M feta means it's very addictive
unless of course your brain works
definitely differently like mine does
and you actually have ADHD where it has
the opposite effect like I said I've
never ever felt like I wanted to take
more than what I'm prescribed because I
actually have it and I don't get high
off of it I think that that's a common
misconception about people with ADHD is
that we're lucky that we're on and feta
means or something because we can
concentrate all the time where we're so
hyper
we're not hyper because of it or hyper
without it we're still hyper I'm still
hyper and I take a lot of medication but
um you know that's just who I am as a
person I'm a very hyper person and I'm
bright and I'm in your face and that's
just how I am
I just tend to be able to hold
conversations better I tend to be able
to concentrate on one thing at a time
when I take my medication and that's
huge for me so that's kind of my little
ADHD story I hope I touched up on all
the points that my subscriber I'm not
gonna say her name but I hope that I
touched upon on all the points that she
asked she didn't want me to talk about
the medications I personally taken
things like that and I wasn't really
gonna I was a little uncomfortable at
first but then honestly who cares
everybody who knows me knows this about
you know me and I'm not in any way
embarrassed in any way shape or form and
I just want to say if you are someone
who thinks that you have a DD or ADHD
usually I want to say usually because
you can develop it as an adult but it's
more common that this is something that
you've had since you were very very
young so um you know if you're just kind
of having a hard time in school and you
know what you want something that will
help you more you know that's actually
just technically like abusing a drug
that you don't need so I'm just trying
to put that I know I'm getting into a
whole topic but it's just it's not
appropriate to take it if you don't need
it there are people that actually
and you know just just don't do it but
anyway I want to say if you do think
that you are you know you do have ADHD
or a DD you cannot just go to a doctor
and say can you give me a prescription
and they will never do that because this
drug is abused so much and because
people will be people who don't have it
take it and die you know or they have
like horrible symptoms it's really
really unfortunate drugs are made for
specific people that's why they do
testing and things like that when I got
my testing done for ADHD they took scans
of my brain they hooked me up to a
little machine they did an MRI i sat in
a room and did actual testing for three
hours straight this is not something
that's to be joked around with if you
catch my drift
I think that it's one of those things
everybody knows about now because you
think that it's like caffeine but better
but it is seriously dangerous if you do
not have eight h.d and you need to be
careful again with a DD - there are
different medications for a DD I just
want to touch on this because she did
ask the subscriber asked what's the huge
difference and I like I explained I
think that they have different sorts of
medications for a DD a DD like I said
you have attention deficit disorder but
no hyperness you know you're not moving
around constantly you don't have a bunch
of things or channels going off in your
brain you really just have trouble
finishing through to the end or you've
just not motivated things like that and
it really is just the opposite for
people with ADHD you know I just find
that I mean it's overwhelming in the
morning before I take my medication I I
go when I do all my skincare stuff while
it's waiting to like kick in because I'm
just all over the place you know I'm
like bouncing everywhere I could never
really truly like sit down and film or
do something like that if I had not
taken my meds because I would be like oh
hey guys yeah so oh yeah look at this oh
my god you know like just all over the
place so I like to get stuff done I
recommend if you do take the medication
get stuff done in the
that doesn't matter if you I guess you
you want to get stuff done before it
kicks in that it doesn't matter if it's
a like you're bouncing off the walls
like shampooing my hair it doesn't
matter if I'm bouncing off the walls but
you don't want to go to like a class or
something before you've taken your
medication if you're like me however
there's been times that that's happened
I also recommend again if you are
diagnosed and you have a prescription
sometimes if you do have to be somewhere
early in the morning waking up a little
before it take your medication and then
get up and then you will feel so much
better you wait about an hour in between
our two hours depending on what
medication you're taking and you will
wake up feeling like okay I feel okay
for me at least for ADHD you wake up and
you're like okay feel calm I don't feel
like I'm gonna go and like fly around in
my bedroom or something it sounds so
weird but I'm just trying to give a
really honest view on the whole topic a
lot of people you know I'm in college I
graduate in 12 days anyway um I'm a
bachelor of music I'm so excited
but I have a lot of people that are like
can I have some of your medication or I
mean did you get like high off of it and
I'm like what is the common like the
common misconception is that people some
people it's just everybody thinks that
nobody actually had a TD or ADHD it's
like what about those people that like
all those years like when I was a young
child like literally nobody could
control me I was literally bouncing and
crawling up the wall like don't you
understand some people actually need
this stuff you know I hate when people
just assume I take it for concentration
it does not give me concentration I do
not get high off of it it calms me down
it allows me to turn off all the
channels in my brain and narrow it down
to about five which is better than 25 so
anyway that's just kind of a short video
on my view about ADHD this is a very
touchy subject and I wasn't sure I was
even going to do this
but then again you know it's not like
it's too much information or TMI I'm
happy to share my experiences I will say
that you know I have gone through that
whole kind of thing and especially when
I was young all the testing and all that
kind of stuff and it can take a very
long time but usually when you have ADHD
it's pretty well known very quickly but
you have to go through the testing and
you want to make sure you get on the
right medication and you need to do
what's best for you I've never had any
issues on any of these medications some
people explain that they can jittery or
hyper things like that maybe you don't
have ADHD you know maybe you don't or
you were misdiagnosed because it's it's
also common that people go in and they
kind of fake symptoms which is also just
kind of insulting but again just one of
those things a little bit of a rant -
it's just annoying I didn't think that
I'm a college-age kid and anytime
someone sees me take my medication at
school or something they're like oh you
can feel great in like 45 minutes and
I'm like actually I'll just keep feeling
good because I already took my morning
dose and I feel calm and there's just
the sense of that calmness which I don't
even know if it comes through because
people tell me all the time you're so
bubbly and I love that my personality
still shows through it's just you know
taking down a notch but still um I will
say I love my ADHD and I'm not ashamed
of it I love that I and always an
optimistic person even before I take my
meds sometimes my meds like bring you
down to the point where I'm like oh now
I feel like a normal person like I wake
up feeling great every single day and
some people are like wow that's awesome
you know what it is it's awesome and
yeah I just I I like my ADHD I'm not
trying to hide it in a closet
I am just trying to make sure that it's
not crazy and I'm not crawling off the
walls or I keep bringing that up but I
mean it you know like I just I just want
to make sure I'm not bouncing off the
walls I still want to be able to
you know talk and get through something
without being like oh well oh my gosh Oh
or talking about something different and
still a lot of that still happens to me
where I get off of top like off of the
off topic however that's just who I am
and I like that I'm on a dosage of the
medication that doesn't completely numb
me to the point where I'm a different
person I'm definitely still me just a
more call me
which some of you are gonna be like wow
she's even more hyper than this that's
crazy
but um yeah so I thought I'd just share
this I'm gonna be filming some other
stuff later so if you're not interested
in this video you don't need to watch of
course um but I thought I'd bring it up
I thought it was funny that this new
subscriber just right away kind of could
tell it's one of those things where I
don't really say anything unless
somebody asks I'll always be truthful
I'm not gonna say oh no I don't because
I do um and yeah and I do want to
mention somebody asked me to because of
your ADHD is that what makes you a
positive person because you are hyper
all the time I don't think so I think
it's just who I am
and I actually like that the happiness
and the hyperness I just I like feeling
full of sunshine that's just how I feel
and even when I take my meds I still can
feel that so anyway yeah now we're
getting into a whole thing about
different personalities and whatnot but
um I just wanted to touch up on the
topic I thought it was interesting and I
was kind of intrigued by the fact that
she could tell so easily a lot of people
I don't know let me know in the comments
if you can tell right away I think you
guys would die like laughter if I ever
came on here without taking my meds I
will never do that don't even ask
but I know a lot of you say you have a
really nice uplifting spirit and that's
just who I am
you know and it's even more uplifting
before I take my meds in the morning but
it still shines through and I can't beat
that I can be
I can have one channel going and I can
have a conversation with you guys
without going off-topic and that you
guys appreciate that brightness in me
that kind of that you know I'm very I'm
just I'm happy I'm a happy person and I
can appreciate that you guys appreciate
that about me because that's truly who I
am even without medication so anyway
just wanted to touch on that yeah I mean
it's it's a touchy subject I'm sure I'm
going to get some comments about stuff
and that's fine but um this was just my
personal experience um I you know like I
said I've been taking medications for 15
years now it's been a very long time
I've been dealing with this since I was
a kid
and I don't even like to say dealing
with it because it is Who I am
and I just like to take medications to
make me feel a little more calm so that
I can still be Who I am because I like
Who I am and I'm not ashamed and yeah so
anyway I hope this didn't turn into some
kind of a rant if you're not interested
in this video you know well now I'm
saying this at the end of the video but
don't watch I mean you know what I mean
it's just one of those things once in a
while probably throw in a video like
this I just thought it was intriguing
that one of my subscribers could see
that about me right away and I liked
that she said you're so bright and you
seem so happy because that's who I am as
a person you know and it's funny to know
that I'm even more so before I take my
medication and it's like it's kind of
like a blessing you know like people say
oh that sucks that you have a TD or ADHD
and I sometimes say well yeah it does
suck but nowadays I'm kind of thinking
no I have like I love my brain like it's
so I think uplifting and magical
thoughts all the time like that's kind
of special so anyway if you have ADHD or
a DD don't be ashamed of telling people
just be happy with who you are you're a
little hyper
that's okay some people like literally
can't even get enough motivation to get
out of bed in the morning we should be
lucky thankful happy so anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed this little video I
will be filming some beauty videos later
so you guys can definitely check that
out I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
