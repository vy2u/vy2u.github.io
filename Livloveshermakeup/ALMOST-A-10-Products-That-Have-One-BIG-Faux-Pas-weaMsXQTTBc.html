my channel I am so sorry if my face
looks like 10 shades darker than my neck
today I am trying out that new photo
focus powder from Wet n Wild that I
recently hauled on Tuesday and yesterday
was the NYX brow pencil which I have
ended up really not liking it was so
orange in my brows and today here we are
dealing with this super super dark
powder so I tried to let you things up
but I'm sorry if there's some
discrepancies between my face and my
neck but today I thought it would be fun
to talk a little bit about products that
are almost a perfect 5 or a perfect 10
depending on what kind of rating scale
you do so if these are products that
really really appease me I'm very very
happy with them for the most part except
there is one faux pas and that is kind
of with keeping these products from
being the top tier kind of scale for me
personally so let's go ahead and jump
right into it guys I'm gonna start with
something from the Too Faced sweet
peaches line yes I do actually enjoy
something from the Too Faced sweet
peaches line I've always liked the
papadum peach blush I like the packaging
I do like the scent i what i mean by the
packaging is not so much the kid sea
thing but I love that it has a mirror
built in here you get a really nice
amount of product in here I feel like
for the price it's pretty darn good it's
a beautiful beautiful nude kind of color
with a gold sheen running through it the
only problem with this blush is it has
basically no where time you guys I mean
I will put this on two of my skin and
literally within an hour or two I do
have to touch this up and it's one of
those products where I almost can't even
do pout the color in my collection which
is funny because you would look at it
and think hey that's a pretty a basic
bitch kind of blush and I could
definitely do pout that color but I
really can't I can't find something that
has the same sort of beautiful golden
undertones in there the same neutral yet
peachy kind of vibe going on and it's
one of those products that I just really
I love but I hate at the same time
because I have such a hard time with it
the wear time so I do have to go ahead
and carry this around with me if I am
going to wear it to work and I do touch
up throughout the day which is kind of
embarrassing for a blush but I thought
I'd let you guys know anyway
are we moving on to a powder highlight
here from Illamasqua I feel like I don't
talk about this very often because of
its one big faux pas this
is what it looks like you have beautiful
packaging again with a huge mirror as
you guys can see which I love this is a
beautiful beautiful champagne tone to
highlight now it is one of those more
baked kind of highlights and usually I
don't go for those kind of highlights
but when you get this onto the skin it
leaves just the most beautiful glossy
sort of glow and it's buildable so you
can go from like a light kind of wash up
I was gonna say color a light a watch of
galuf sina stew a full-on like wash of
glossiness but the one problem with this
is when you get in direct sunlight you
see micro glitters everywhere and it's
not the kind of thing where it's like if
you're very precise with it you'll
notice it right here I mean it's
everywhere it looks like you had it
follow from your eyeshadow you have it
down here for some reason you know it's
all over the face and it's just one of
those what are those product that really
kind of holds me back from using it
because I just consistently noticed in
the sunlight that direct micro glitter
and it really lights up my face and a
not so great way I feel like it clings
to dry patches it clings to my fine
lines and wrinkles and it does really
bother me to be completely honest that
everything else about this formula and
everything else about the color and the
packaging and the price I love it I
really really love it but this is the
one big faux pas for this product is
that unfortunately it does have tiny
micro glitters in it when you are
directly in in the sunlight all right up
next we have the wet and wild
lasha renegade at mascara i love the
formula on this it's kind of sticky and
a little bit tacky it hangs onto the
lashes all day long but it's not so much
like a and waterproof mascara where you
can't get it off at the end of the night
it's honestly perfect it doesn't travel
down here it doesn't travel up here I
like the way it goes on I like that it
gives me the trifecta lashes you get
length you give volume you get thickness
I mean you literally get everything with
this for dollar ninety-nine cent mascara
but the one big faux pas is the actual
wand now if this is a rubber bristle and
as you guys can see and I like this part
of the one but the ball up here is huge
and every single time without fail I put
this on I hit my eyeball and you guys
know what a feels like when you
hit your eyeball or the goddamn mascara
it really really hurts so what I'm
actually thinking about doing is just
snipping that ball off because I never
use it I never like it the only time I
ever really use it is for my little
outer wispy lashes that are right here
so I'll go like this but I
like it for going on the lower lashes
like this anytime I use it it's just too
 big you know and I hit my
eyeballs so this is actually one of
those products that I think I can make
into a perfect tan I'm gonna go ahead
and snip off the little ball at the end
of the wand but I wanted to go ahead and
recommend it anyway because this is a
fantastic mascara from the drugstore
alright guys up next we have the Becca
shimmering skin perfecter liquid these
are beautiful you guys know I love the
powder ones I have them behind me my
whole little collection they're
absolutely beautiful in the powder
formula they're great in the poured
formula they're great in the liquid
formula but there is definitely one big
faux pas when it comes to this so a lot
of people like to use this as a liquid
highlight for me personally I like to
actually mix this into my foundation and
I notice without fail this will break
down the wear of my foundation
throughout the day by three to four
hours it doesn't matter if I'm wearing a
makeup extending sort of primer if I'm
wearing a pore filling primer if I'm
wearing a hydrating primer if I'm
wearing a full coverage foundation a
light coverage foundation a CC cream a
BB cream if I mix these in initially it
looks beautiful and let me tell you I
recently found a great pairing for
moonstone right here this one's pearl
moonstone mixed together with the Urban
Decay Naked skin foundation then the
shade 0.5 is gorgeous on the skin but
like I said these will without fail
break down my foundation throughout the
day so that is one big faux pas what I
really like about them like I said is
that they're really really nice as they
liquid highlight if you want to use them
that way but when I mix them together
into a foundation I get that beautiful
beautiful glow and it just kind of puts
a little bit of a healthy radiance back
into my skin which is very very dry at
the moment so those are the Becca
shimmering skin perfecter and finally
guys we have the market Jacobs glosses
these are probably the best losses I
have ever tried and even though they do
have a little bit of a faux pas for me
personally they still perform absolutely
beautifully these are pigmented and
they're creamy upon first application
and they do stay on very very nicely
throughout the day if you guys are
curious they do have sugar sugar on my
lips today I'm not much of a nude girl
but I actually do like this lip gloss by
itself so the big faux pas when it comes
to these guys is the texture change
throughout the day so initially when you
do put them on they go on incredibly
creamy I mean almost feels like
putting a little on okay but I do notice
that they get very very sticky
throughout the day now I'm not much of a
gloss girl so this could be something
that happens with all glosses but I just
noticed it and because I am a
professional flutist and stuff I'm
always practicing and I'm always kind of
moving my lips notice like my lips
maybe it's just something subconsciously
that's like oh my god there's something
on my lips but it feels very sticky and
if I get like my hair if I have my
little top layers of my whispies out
like this and it gets stuck there
I mean it's stuff forever it practically
feels like so these are definitely a
little weird because I feel like they go
on so beautifully but then after a while
they start to get very very sticky it's
almost like they oxidize with the air or
something and it's just not really my
favorite thing but these are still
absolutely my favorite gloss formula out
there if there are any formulas or any
colors I'm sorry any colors that I would
recommend you guys check out definitely
chit chit changes which is a beautiful
beautiful it's kind of like a trichrome
you have this gorgeous kind of I would
say burgundy base with all these
beautiful reflex and a purple green blue
a gold absolutely stunning really makes
your lips look nice and plump as well I
also really love this one which is
called skin deep which is a little more
of a nude shape but a half a cool tone
base so if you're not into that typical
typical kind of very very nude color
like I'm wearing today this one is
absolutely great and then also I would
definitely recommend this guy right here
which is called a boys don't cry and
this is like a true purple I've been
really into purple glosses this week if
you guys couldn't tell and I don't know
I just really really like this I feel
like a little alien when I have purple
gloss on but yeah anyway guys those are
products that are almost perfect in my
opinion I really don't have too many bad
things to say about them because there's
only one faux pas and that is holding
them back in my personal opinion please
let me know what you think of these
products down below and also let me know
what are your top tier products and I
want to know what are your products that
almost make that cut that are almost bad
 good so that's pretty much it
thanks for joining me guys and I guess I
will see you tomorrow
