today this time we are talking about
amazing products that you may have
overlooked so you may be thinking okay
Olivia look at your thumbnail why are
you making a depressing face in the
thumbnail the reason why I'm doing that
is because we're kind of talking about
packaging duds so we're talking about
really good products that actually just
are not very properly packaged they're
not very eye-catching um they just don't
really make you want to like pick them
off of the actual shelf so that is why
I'm frowning in the thumbnail because
we're talking about really good products
here that honestly just have shitty
packaging so anyway I'm just going to go
through a few with you guys you may not
be attracted to these products based on
how they look on the outside but I
promise you what's on the inside is what
counts and they are very good on the
inside so let's go ahead and get started
the first example that I want to talk
about are definitely the L'Oreal True
Match blushes I really like these I
think I have about three or four of them
this particular shade is called c12 baby
blossom which is a very nice light
peachy kind of pink color or a cool
toned pink color so I feel like the
packaging on this is just ridiculous
I mean how old-school can we get I don't
feel like people want to pick this up
because it's so bulky you're getting
that little compartment at the bottom
where they give you this little crappy
brush that of course nobody's ever going
to use you do get a little mirror but
why not just make it sleeker put in a
mirror here and then just like make it
like black packaging or something I feel
like this sort of like silvery gray
color everything about it just looks
outdated and honestly I would not want
to pick up more of these if I didn't
know how good they were so I think that
the quality of these are amazing but the
packaging is totally just a fail so I
would highly recommend checking them out
don't be disturbed by the packaging they
actually are very very good quality
another really good example of that are
these covergirl blushes these are the
classic color blushes these are some of
the most beautiful blushes you will ever
put on your cheeks I'm not even kidding
this particular shade is called 540 rose
silk I mean look at this packaging it's
like are you kidding me right now it
literally goes like this and you have a
little mirror here and then you have
just this little strip of color I mean
what were they thinking they give you
like a little bit of a brush the product
even smells horrible but I'm telling you
right now these are so beautiful on the
skin it has like a sheen to it like
these blushes are just absolutely insane
and gorgeous so here is the swatch of
rose silk do you guys see how beautiful
that is the sheen
almost like a luminous blush from Becca
or something like that so I would
definitely consider this a packaging dud
or a packaging sale who's going to want
to pick something like this up you know
you can't even see the product through
the actual container here it's just a
total feel but I promise you these are
absolutely wonderful products another
blush that I think is really poorly
packaged are these vivid baked blushes
from makeup revolution so I do like that
they have that clear
you know acrylic thing here but they
feel so incredibly cheap you guys like
when you touch these even in store you
would pick this up and you would think
this would break in half in two seconds
it's kind of like the elf one dollar
packaging and I'll talk about some more
elf packaging in a second I'm just not a
fan of the elf packaging but this is
like the one dollar packaging from elf
and these are beautiful these are very
very good quality so the fact that they
look so cheap and they feel cheap when
you're holding them and things like that
is really a bummer because look at that
blush isn't that beautiful
you can use these boiled and really use
them as a blush or as blush toppers this
particular shade is called make love
instead so it really is just sad that
they have such cheap packaging another
really good example of this is this
covergirl trublend foundation so this is
a product that I think is beautiful it's
a very very basic foundation but it
looks amazing on the skin it looks like
skin it gives a really Demi matte
appearance to the skin it has a nice
coverage I feel like nobody ever talks
about this probably because this is like
the most plain Jane packaging ever I
mean there's like no color going on here
it literally is just like tan with some
white print here I can barely read it
from like two feet away it's absolutely
amazing to me how basic and boring this
package is this packaging is it does
have a pump it's a nice glass bottle
like I feel like if they just put like
pink print on it or even black people
would be able to see this but yeah this
is another perfect example of you know a
foundation I think that just is not
packaged very well but it's actually
very good quality another example of
that is definitely the Revlon Colorstay
whipped it this comes in a big fat
container I feel like they should have
tried to put this in some sort of a pump
or something like that I personally
don't mind the fact that it's in like a
big heavy container like this I can't
open it um but I I personally don't mind
I think this is a beautiful beautiful
foundation but I think people really
didn't want to buy this because it is so
heavy it's clunky it's glass
comes in a very unusual packaging and
the fact that you have to dip your
fingers in there I think actually turns
a lot of people off so this is another
example of a great foundation that I
think was packaged kind of poorly
another foundation that is packaged
super poorly that literally feels like
nothing I literally I mean this feels
like there's nothing in my hand and this
is the hard candy glamoflauge invisible
camouflage foundation this is an amazing
foundation you guys the shade that I
wear is called porcelain but this is so
cheap the packaging everything is
plastic it feels so lightweight like it
feels like there's no product in here
that's how lightweight it is so when I
first picked this up at Walmart I was
like whoo it feels cheap you know and I
feel like when you're picking up a
product and it's like oh my god it feels
cheap you don't want to buy it even
though this is amazing this is amazing
coverage very comparable to the Urban
Decay all nighter foundation in my
opinion and has a better shade selection
and doesn't even oxidize on the skin so
it's amazing to me that this is in such
cheap packaging all right also the elf
packaging first whatever reason the
studio packaging I'm not that into and I
don't know why these are like the elf
studio blushes I think that these are
really fantastic this particular shade
is called giddy gold it's very unique I
don't really have a blush like this that
literally is just a straight-up gold
color you can use it as a highlight you
can use it as a blush but these are
really really nice quality so I like it
when you open it up it does have a
little bit of a mirror but I just don't
like this thing where you can see half
of the product here or a little strip of
the product and then it's just all black
packaging I know they were trying to go
really sleek and things like that but it
still feels cheek to me and they're
$1.00 packaging they're $3.00 packaging
$5 whatever always just feels cheap to
me another example of that is definitely
their blush palettes and illuminating
palettes I prefer the blush palette
packaging so this one I think is good
but the illuminating palette just like
the fact that they what they've like
wrote elf on there and then illuminating
palette I mean I think that the bigger
print just makes it look cheaper and
makes it look not as I don't know like I
don't want to scoop this up as much as I
want to scoop this up so this is a
really nice packaging here very very
sleek but compared to this one for some
reason I look at this and it even has a
surface that really scratches up easily
as you guys can see this one does not so
I don't know there's just something
about that where I dig into the drawer
and I'm like I
more likely to reach for this than this
because of the actual packaging another
perfect example of this are becca
blushes in my opinion now a lot of
people may not agree with me on this but
this is what the typical like becca
blush looks like this is the luminous
blush in d shade snapdragon so really
really tiny packaging here really cute
that it's like a flying saucer perfect
example of amazing packaging from becca
their split pans look at this absolutely
gorgeous golden kind of antique gold
thing going on in the middle tarnished
like silver color and then here we have
the rose quartz highlighter beautiful
love the color coordinating thing i
think that's amazing but this little guy
with like the dark grey and the matte
like texture like i would rather reach
for something colorful and shiny than
something like this so i would say that
in general i know a lot of people still
reach for a becca blushes and is
something that's like obviously it's
very well known but i would say i wish
that they would start color-coordinating
kind of putting like a pretty shiny film
on the outside instead of just doing
that matte dark grey or brownish thing
because i don't think that this is very
appealing i don't really like this
packaging but i love this
alright and another example of this is
the NYC smooth skin bronzer from NYC yet
like i said so this is an amazing
amazing bronzer and i don't know if they
have updated this packaging or not but
this is like the cheapest like most it's
just so it's such cheap packaging you
guys it just feels like a very very
lightweight i do like the fact that it
has a mirror but this is an amazing
bronzer it is absolutely beautiful
especially if you do have a fair
complexion really really good quality
here very smooth very creamy it's been
around forever but i don't actually
think they've updated the packaging on
this now i could be wrong i have not
looked for one lately because this is
the third one that I've gone through and
this has lasted me forever but yeah this
packaging where it literally opens up
like this and it snaps closed
like that's just reminds me of old
school packaging I'm not interested I'm
not very likely to reach for something
like this at the drugstore so another
example of something that's poorly
packaged but is actually really good
quality and then finally the last thing
I want to talk about are these little
quads from Physicians Formula these are
so comparable to the Urban Decay basics
one and two palette these are obviously
really really nicely packaged I love the
Urban Decay palettes but these
just look so incredibly cheap they don't
even have like the name here you just
have this really cheap plastic thing
with like a little push button it's
silver again like that silver or great
thing does anybody else think that this
looks cheap or just like looks like it
would be like children's makeup or
something like that I don't know what it
is but it definitely turns me off I do
like that it has the little flap here so
that you kind of see the actual colors
but this is really cheap packaging for
something that is such good quality you
guys these are probably the best matte
eyeshadows that you will actually find
at the drugstore so again just another
example of a shitty packaging a but a
good product so anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed this video not throwing any
shade whatsoever just saying that the
packaging is not that great but what's
on the inside is really really good so I
hope that maybe I gave you guys some
examples or maybe you want to check out
some of these products because just
because they may look like they
actually have good stuff inside of them
so let me know if you have any packaging
duds that you want to share down below
products that maybe people don't look
into because of the packaging and yeah
that is it I will see you guys soon for
another video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
