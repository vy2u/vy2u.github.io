back to my channel or should I welcome
myself back always when I leave for like
five or six days on my channel I'm like
I should welcome myself back anyway yes
it has been 5 or 6 days since I have
been on here and I wanted to give you
guys a quick little life update I know
that I know that I just filmed a life
update literally like what 3 weeks ago
but I thought I would go ahead and film
another one for you guys because some
other stuff has come up the first thing
I want to talk about is some really
exciting health news so I had told you
guys a while back in a lupus update is
that I was having some issues with my
liver my liver has always been very very
troublesome which I have talked about a
little bit here and there usually when
you do have lupus SLE lupus or any kind
of lupus really I guess it could happen
with there is usually an organ that is
affected by your lupus and for me that
was my liver I had told you guys that
during this trial everything has started
to kind of repair itself and put itself
back together but I got some really
exciting news and that exciting news is
that my liver is completely restored
completely it'll literally put itself
together all the way all the way back
together and so this was really exciting
we got this news a couple of days ago we
still have some more information that we
need to go through with like the doctors
and all that kind of stuff but um that's
a big thing that is a big thing for me
and my lupus so I wanted to share that
with you guys I know I shared it on
snapchat a few days ago but obviously I
know not all of you have snapchat or
snip now all of you have snapchat or
have Instagram just stumbling over my
words because I'm excited but that is a
very very big thing and now I'm going to
be taking a more natural homeopathic
route to with my lupus and Tom stands
behind that my doctors are nice now
standing behind that which at first they
weren't um just because we didn't really
know what was going on with the internal
organs but it's really cool now that we
can do that because there's really not
any internal organs that are being
affected right now by my lupus which is
 badass so very very excited
about that still have some issues with
my skin and my scalp and like outer you
know the way the outer part of the body
but that is really not a big deal um you
know because think about like stuff that
it could be affecting you know my heart
and my organs and all this other kind of
stuff so that is big big news so that is
very exciting
um second of all I have been m.i.a
because Tom and I have just been packing
like crazy people
we are literally moving in like two
weeks and I just wanted to let you guys
know for the month of June there is
going to be
little bit of different kind of posting
schedule going on here on my channel I
don't have a posting schedule to begin
with but there still won't be like a
posting schedule so I'm just going to be
going ahead and throwing up videos for
you guys when I have time to film this
whole past week I have not had time to
fill it all and you guys know I'm pretty
damn good with my time I mean I am
somebody who works full time I can still
fit in filming I can still fit a lot of
stuff into my schedule but it has just
been too packed this past week so
unfortunately I won't be able to do that
um as much as I would like to this next
coming a month but probably in June I'm
thinking four to five videos a week you
know normally I feel like I do about six
or seven is that right yeah usually got
six or seven so maybe four to five again
I'm not going to put a number on it
because I don't know how much I'm going
to be able to post but I do know that
the week that we move I am just going to
take the whole week off and that is just
because this has been a really really
big thing to put together normally I'm
all for like post as much as you can but
right now it's just really difficult
it's like packing up the apartment
getting everything set for Bajor you
know getting everything set for our
friends who are going to be visiting
that's right the next three weekends we
have visitors here so we don't even have
any like space or time to ourselves so
we're just really really busy and I
appreciate you guys being so sweet and
just taking the time to allow us to have
this time so anyway yeah basically my
health really really good right now
which is amazing the move is
really exciting we are literally going
to be living in Arizona in less than
three weeks we're going to be all moved
into our new place I'm so excited to
share that with you guys
obviously I'll share like a little bit
on snapchat not planning on sharing like
a whole apartment tour with you guys
just because of some stuff that has
happened with people kind of leaking
information about Tom and all this kind
of stuff so I'm trying to be better and
now about talking about Tom right now as
well and just because there have been
some reddit posts and just some people
kind of going off and going crazy and
kind of looking a little too far into
our relationship lately and so if you
don't see me mentioning Tom as much it's
not because we're broken up it's not
good ly ate each other it's not anything
like that it's just I'm trying to
protect his identity and his safety and
I know that might sound really stupid
but it's just one of those things where
a lot of people are reading really far
into our relationship right now and it
really bums me out because it's like you
know I really don't believe that you
should be talking about something if you
don't know about that certain something
and it really does bum me out when
people kind of sit there and accuse or
assume things that accuse assume things
about our relationship when in fact like
none of the stuff that they're talking
about is true I find that very very
hurtful and I just think it's really not
necessary so if I start talking about
Tom a little less on my actual YouTube
channel you guys know why I'm just
trying to protect him protect our
relationship I think that's the most
important thing is like our relationship
comes first before YouTube of course so
I'm just protecting that and I yeah that
is pretty much it you guys so basically
I'm going to be posting as much as I can
this month but we are going to be fully
moved in by the end of the month by the
end of June which is absolutely crazy I
will have a fifty thousand subscriber
double giveaway coming up for you guys
it's going to be once we are all settled
in at the new place so expect all the
posting and all that kind of stuff to be
back to like a regular sort of thing I
don't want to say schedule because again
I don't have a posting schedule but a
regular sort of thing by July but yeah
that is pretty much it I'm going to be
posting an elf skin care review for you
guys tomorrow and then the next day I
have my review and swatches on the
pretty vulgar cosmetics line which I did
pick up quite a few items from there I
want to let you guys know if I think
that's worth it or not
and yeah that's pretty much it so thank
you so much for joining me guys and I
will see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
