my channel today I have an anti host to
share with you guys all about the new ax
I want candy collection that we'll be
releasing on September 3rd on the
two-faced rock on website as well as I
believe the Altamonte website now and
this is a collection that I will not be
purchasing anything from and clearly
since I'm doing an antique haul and I
really encourage you guys to go ahead
and check this out and swatch it out in
store before purchasing and before
making that big purchase on the Too
Faced calm website when you have a
really hard time returning all that shit
listen this is just one of those things
I immediately saw the collection and I
was like red lights going off all over
the place I need to warn you guys so I
want to start by saying a lot of this
stuff looks so fucking similar to
everything the two-face has been
releasing and I really do feel like
two-faced needs to be fucking roasted
for some of this shit because they are
releasing so many collections right now
and they're releasing a collection next
week which I will actually be doing a
roast video on called roasted peaches
and that is going to be for the peaches
and cream collection they're releasing
huge collections right now now I really
do feel like a lot of this has to do it
with it the fact that they have been
bought out by Estee Lauder ever since
they were bought out by US state law or
you guys two-face has been releasing
first of all pretty crappy products and
second of all they have been releasing
products over and over and over again
like every fucking month they have a new
release so basically what's happening is
only 31st they will be releasing the
peaches and cream collection and then on
September 3rd they have this huge candy
collection coming out now what they did
here was very very smart and let me tell
you why so you know when a collaboration
usually happens with like a beauty
youtuber or a beauty influencer they
usually have one product that they
really focus on so when I shadow palette
or an all-in-one palette or a face
palette what happens is Beauty reviewers
like me get their hands on them and we
realize it's a piece of shit and we rip
that shit to shreds ok so what they did
here was they took a huge collection and
I feel like a lot of people are going to
be distracted by one item so I don't
think that the reviews are going to be
as a negative but I really don't think
this collection is going to be that
great so I highly recommend if you are
interested going store swatch it out all
that good stuff so before we do get into
this I want to say really quickly I
actually really do like candy Johnson so
this has nothing to do with her this is
more just towards you know Too Faced in
general I feel like two-face has just
been a really really crappy brand lately
they used to be my all-time favorite
brand I know a lot about the brand I
have purchased a lot of items from the
brand
I do not think this is going to be a
good collaboration I just don't see it
being a success and it has nothing to do
with candy Johnson herself she is
definitely one of those people that is
very open and bright and sunny and when
you watch her you can't feel sad you
know what it means she just had that
really really wonderful radiating sort
of sunny personality to her and I really
respect that however I feel like she's
way better than to face and I really
hope that this collection does end up
being good for her sake and I hope that
they're not fucking her over like they
did with nikkietutorials but anyway
let's go ahead and just get right into
the anti house enough with my ranting
let's go ahead and jump in so the first
item that they will be releasing into
this collection is a $30 setting a
powder now this is called the I want
candy banana pudding a setting powder
it's an all over pudding powder that
locks and sets the makeup to perfection
to give you that flawless Photoshop
finish and just like candy now when I
first saw this I was like I want it I
want it cuz it's fucking smells like
bananas then you know how to laces with
all their sentence yet okay I just want
it cuz it smells like peaches
I want it cuz it smells like chocolate
well I'm done with they're scented shit
okay I'm done with it I know with it I
don't think it's good I don't want it
anymore I'm just I'm done with the
fucking scent okay now this does sound
very very cute and originally when I saw
a photo on trend mode I really thought
it was gonna be kind of like an under
eye setting powder because I have that
strong yellow tone but if you actually
go into the Too Faced kaam website and
you zoom in on the photo and this is
supposed to be an all-over setting
pattern it actually is like a tone
correcting powder has a little bits of
pink in there a little bits of green and
then you have the yellow now you guys
know I'm a huge fan of tone correcting
powders my ELF tone correcting powder in
cool is my ride-or-die they also have a
warm tone version which I feel like it's
gonna be pretty similar to this so if
you are someone that does set your face
every single day and you go through
powder like a fucking water like I do I
would highly recommend just picking up
the elf setting powder I don't think
you're going to need an all-over setting
powder for $30 that just seems
incredibly insane if you want to use
this to set your under-eye that's
fantastic but overall I have no idea if
this is gonna be good but the more I
look at it and realize what it actually
is the less I am intrigued alright guys
moving on we have the iPod candy candy
eyes eye shadow palette - this retails
for $45 and looks like literally every
other palate the two basses released now
when I see the photo on the actual
toothpaste comm website compared to the
ones that I've seen on trend mood I will
say it reminds me a lot of the chocolate
bonbons palette so on day two face
Stockholm website it looks very much
warm tone but when you actually look at
the pictures on trend mood it looks very
cool town now we all know the two things
either does a warm tone neutral palette
or a fucking gold tone neutral palette
it's all the same so if you do already
have the chocolate bonbons palette I
feel like you have the majority of the
colors you don't need it this is a great
formula right here the nine pan palette
or the majority of the nine pan palettes
and the chocolate bar palette are very
very good from Too Faced when it comes
to their holiday palettes when it comes
to their collaboration palettes they are
just not formulated the same they're not
good quality and I would not recommend
you pick them up alright moving on guys
we have thee I want candy candy Glo
liquid illuminator you don't get a lot
of product in here and it retails for
$30 I really feel like this is kind of
not super trendy right now I get the
whole concept and again it's a candy
scented Luminizer a lot of people are
gonna want it because it's candy Johnson
it looks like a deep kind of mommy color
with a little bit of a gold shift now I
am NOT somebody who likes liquid
illuminators I don't like them in the
squeezy tube I don't like I'm gonna have
to paint them onto my face I don't like
them I find them sticky I find them
tacky they move my fucking foundation
they move my powder I hate it so I feel
like if you're someone with extremely
dry skin and you think that this will
match your skin tone that's fantastic
but you know they really really kind of
take a little bit of a hit and when a
brand comes out with just one
highlighter because this is not gonna
work for everyone's skin tone looking at
this color right here I'm thinking oh
yeah I'll work on my skin
no I'm tan right now this is clearly
going to be way too dark but I again go
in store and swatch it if you're looking
into this collection I mean that's the
one thing I just want to say over and
over if you want it that's fucking
fantastic but please go in store and
check out the quality before you
purchase it again you don't get a lot of
product in here wet and wild recently
released some stick highlighters that
look very very similar so I don't need
it I don't think you guys need it let's
move on all right next up we have the I
want candy licorice liner right now
there are rumors that this actually
smells like black licorice which is
disgusting okay that is disgusting a
black licorice scented liner now again I
feel like this is maybe slightly I don't
want to see dated because I'm not a girl
who can do a fucking winged liner okay
you never see me rocking one because I
can't do it but I will say I don't see
people use these kind of liners as much
I noticed that people use more like pen
eyeliner so I know that two-face already
has like a pen eyeliner kind of thing in
their collection but I think it would
have been cool if they had done maybe
like a colorful liner because that just
kind of reminds me of candy Johnson you
know what I mean
not like I said I'm not someone who
wears liquid liner so I wouldn't get
this no matter what but if this is
licorice scented that's kind of fucking
gross it does say it's a wearing liner
that includes a flex two edge felt tip
applicator that makes for goof proof
application and sharp gorgeous lines I
mean I feel like you can get something
like this from fucking NYC or freaking
you know wet and wild wet and wild has
that really really awesome eyeliner like
this and that is what retails for three
or five dollars you don't need this just
because it has the name candy on it
doesn't mean anything you can support
her in different ways do you guys know
what I mean so this is not something
that I would personally pick up again go
in store and swatch it out make sure
it's good pigmentation make sure it has
a nice amount of wear time to do it
before picking it up but that does
retail for eighteen dollars you don't
get a lot of product in there alright
and finally guys we have some of the I
want candy melts hidden matte liquid
lipsticks now I am someone who's
actually wearing a fucking liquid
lipstick today okay
recently the balm cosmetics sent over
some of these meet Matt Hewitt liquid
lipsticks for me now I'm not someone
who's good with my lips okay my lips
always look like shit because I'm a
professional flutist and they're just
always messed up but I will say I
actually like these liquid lipsticks I'm
very picky when it comes to liquid
lipsticks I have tried the Too Faced
melted matte liquid lipsticks I've tried
three of them I tried child star and
then I tried on like a deep kind of
brown color and then a purple I hated
them they are incredibly incredibly dry
now when I say that these are actually
kind of comfortable on the lips I mean
it I would definitely go for the balm
cosmetics the liquid lipsticks or even
I've recently tried out the wet and wild
I know a lot of people don't like these
but they're working for me these are the
liquid cat suit liquid lipsticks these
ones are the metallic ones from the new
midnight mermaid collection they have
all sorts of fun colors as you guys can
see now this is a melted matte
collection with candy is supposed to be
all sorts of different shades so they
have one that's more of a new
which of course I think that you did a
good job with the color selection here
you have melted ice cream and then you
have one right here which is called
freshly baked which is a little more of
like a muted purpley pink color I would
say then you have tropical punch which
is a bright fuchsia and then you do have
sweet and sour which looks like sweet
and sour sauce and it's just a true red
I really feel like that embodies her all
those different colors all those bright
fun colors if you're a fan of the liquid
lipstick formula maybe that's something
you want to pick up but I feel like you
can get something for a better price you
can get something that's super super
comfortable on the lips and you don't
have to go and spend that amount of
money so anyway guys that is pretty much
it I will not be purchasing any of these
items let me know if you're gonna
purchase anything from the I want candy
collection thanks so much for joining me
guys I'll see you for that roast video
next Wednesday and yeah that's pretty
much it
