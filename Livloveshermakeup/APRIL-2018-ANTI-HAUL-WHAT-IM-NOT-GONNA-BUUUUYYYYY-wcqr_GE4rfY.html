today I am sharing my April 2018 anti
ahah talking all about products some
 I'm not gonna buy it
let's go ahead and jump right into it I
want to start with the new a beach
summer 2018 collection from Urban Decay
I definitely won't be picking anything
up from this collection especially the
beached ice shadow palettes I had a lot
of you tagging me on Instagram asking if
I was interested in this and guys I have
to say I am NOT I feel like we've been
seeing a lot of the same sort of things
from Urban Decay recently and when it
comes to really really warm tone shades
paired with really really cool tone
shades I get stuck in a rut I don't know
how to combine these kind of colors
together especially when I'm looking at
the color and seeing heat wave and
Daybreak and thinking how the am I
supposed to pair that together with
plunge and double dip I don't know if I
need to be inspired a little more if I
need to go watch some more tutorials or
something but I really don't have a good
time at combining really really warm
tone shades with really really cool tone
shades I either like it all warm toned I
like today or like an all cool tone eye
or something neutral or in between so I
will not be picking this up as well as I
just feel like a lot of these shades
we've already seen in previous Urban
Decay palettes like daybreak heatwave
blaze and salt although I really do
enjoy on my backtalk palette this I do
not need alright guys let's move on to
the 10th anniversary collection coming
out from Kat Von D's she has a
highlighter as well as a few other
products but specifically so many of you
guys were asking me about the 10th
anniversary eyeshadow palette now
looking at this eyeshadow palette I know
we haven't seen anything like up close
and personal yet but it looks and
reminds me so much of the Kat Von D
Saint and sinner palette as well as the
Kat Von D metal mat so I have to say no
on this you guys I just absolutely don't
need it and I know a lot of people are
comparing this to the me vida loca
palette which I have talked about in
depth on how I really wanted to pick it
up I never was able to get my hands on
it but when I look at my Kat Von D
palettes I realized there are so many
overlapping shades and finishes I just
really don't need all of them so between
this and the metal map as well as the
metal matte mini I am NOT going to get
this palette
know if you're gonna pick it up down
below but for me it is a passion lorac
is releasing a pro 4 palette and when I
saw this I I put it on Instagram and so
many of you were like ahem what it looks
like tentacle to these soft a glam
palette you guys and I mean it looks so
 boring now don't get me wrong I
love the lorac Pro formula I haven't
been purchasing from lorac recently just
because I wasn't able to get a
definitive answer on their cruelty-free
status and that really bothers me as I
always say you are either cruelty-free
or you're not ok there is no
in-between or gray area but you know the
lorac Pro palette are really really
beautiful the majority of the time I am
just really really astounded that they
came out with something so basic like
this it looks like a little more of a
neutral and muddied down version of like
the lorac Pro 1 and as so many people
again we're saying it's so similar to
the soft glam palette from Anastasia
Beverly Hills I'd absolutely no interest
in that palette whatsoever it looked
incredibly basic to me and I have a
palette like this that has the same sort
of color seems sort of finish I find
that this gets muddy together very
easily it could just be my skill level
which isn't super high I have a very
hard time like showing and defining
certain colors when they're all within
this really kind of muddied down realm
you're gonna get it I would love to know
down below but yeah pass it on that
alright let's move on to sort of a
skincare a product I guess this is
something you would wear underneath a
makeup but you could probably also wear
it at nighttime it is new from tatcha it
is their pearl illuminating tinted eye
cream so this is basically just a
glorified eye cream and I will say I do
like the shade selection they have a
shade called moonlight which looks like
it will match to those of you who do
have a fair to light complexion soft
light seems to have a little more of a
yellowy undertone and leans more in the
medium to deep range and then you have
candlelight which is definitely a deeper
shade and I think that's a great if you
want to pop this on with like a BB cream
I can imagine it would give some sort of
brightness throughout the day as well as
some sort of coverage but like I said I
feel like it's just a glorified eye
cream it's incredibly expensive and
there is something about tatcha and
their products are so so expensive but I
don't really notice that big of a
difference in my skin
I've tried a lot of different products
from them I know my boyfriend does enjoy
some products from them mostly the ones
I just passed a long deal of because
they didn't work for me but you know I
just feel like for such a hefty a price
point I need something that is
absolutely a hundred percent going to
work not just be like oh I kind of see a
difference in my skin you guys know what
I mean
and this is the thing about eye cream I
feel that you could just take your
moisturizer or an oil or anything around
the eye area as long as it is I safe and
you are going to get the same sort of
result I feel as if I creams are a
gimmick I recently told you guys that in
2018 I will not be purchasing any new
eye creams and I'm standing by that so
this is something I feel like for me it
would be a waste if you're someone who
wears a really really light makeup on an
everyday basis and you want something
that's just really light and easy to pop
on it has a little bit of a tint to it
maybe this will work for you but don't
expect to see any sort of huge results
in my opinion and finally I was getting
so many tags on this product and I was
kind of shocked because I have talked
about morphe in the past before I will
link my video above all about morphe I
did a dedicated video on them but yeah
you guys morphe doesn't work for me I
understand that they are now
reformulating some of their products and
I will say when I saw the photos of
these blush trios as well as their blush
palettes I'm like what the is that
they looked really really nice I
honestly thought that those trios were
like some sort of new Anasazi of Beverly
Hills those colors for their trios and I
got really really excited but no they
are from morphe the blush trios are $12
apiece and the blush palettes are $28
and if you guys watch that video all
about morphia I have talked about how
the only products from morphe that
really do work for me are their i''m
brushes are their eye brushes all that
 great no they are not you
definitely have to replace them over and
over and over again I have eye brushes
like an e 40 from Sigma that I have had
for literally six years versus like an M
31 or 530 or whatever from morphe and
those fall apart in two months whereas
my Sigma brush I've had for five or six
years you know there are really good
quality brushes out there that you can
get and I would recommend investing your
money more into like Sigma brushes
versus morphe brushes do you have a few
more few brushes hanging around I'm not
gonna lie to you guys but there
shadow palettes have left me with skin
or reactions and I at reactions I get
puffed up or really puffed up eyes I
have tried two or three of their
palettes with all the same sort of thing
happening
I have tried a few of their base
products and honestly I just don't think
they're any good because I just can't do
it I just don't like morphe enough to
purchase from them so I yeah so anyway
guys that is it - those are all the
products that are in anti hauling for
the month of April let me know down
below if you're gonna pick any of these
up or if you are going to pass on them
thank you so much for joining me and
I'll see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
