have another video for you guys tonight
and this time it is actually a collab
video it is a collab review video with
my friend Meg Bernardo here on youtube
if you guys didn't know already meg is
the person that I collab with every
single month on sample spotlight she's
very genuine very honest very
straightforward which I love and I think
you guys would enjoy her too so I'm
gonna leave her video her channel and
also her instagram down below in case
you guys would like to go over and check
out her review on some artesa brush
dupes but yeah that is that we are
concentrating on in this video I bought
a set of ten different brushes here this
is what it looks like from amazon and i
believe this totaled out to be twenty
seven dollars and ninety-five cents i'm
going to have the direct link down below
in the description bar it is not an
affiliate link it's just going to take
you directly to the actual buyer of
where i purchase this but i have been
very curious about these artistes
brushes i feel like i see them
everywhere I feel like a lot of people
have been sent to the brushes and then
other people just buy them themselves so
on the website when I looked up artis if
you do want one of their like 10 piece
brush sets it can cost you up to like
four hundred dollars which in my opinion
is kind of crazy I am someone who loves
to collect makeup and also skincare but
I've never been super super into brushes
so I'm not going to say that you're
crazy if you buy artiste brushes if you
think it is worth the money and I'm sure
that they last a long time and they're
fantastic quality so if you are someone
who really does care about that kind of
stuff than I think it's great I think
that you should but I hadn't purchased
brushes that make you happy but for me
personally those are so freaking
expensive like I can't see myself buying
them some of my favorite brushes that I
have are from ELF and like BH Cosmetics
and I like morphine Sigma as well but
seriously some of my favorites are from
very like kind of cheaper brands but if
you are someone who really does want the
real deal then i guess i will link the
artiste brush com website down below i'm
not affiliate with them i'll just take
you to the actual website so that you
can look through the different models
and all that kind of stuff that they
have because they have different kind of
sets for the eyes for the face 10-piece
say a five-piece all that kind of stuff
but anyway and this is what the actual
box looks like and this is def this is
called the multi-purpose makeup brush
it's called the mermaid multi-purpose
brush the beginning of beauty from pro
balance I don't really know it just have
all these words all over it basically
you are getting ten different brushes in
here you're getting face brushes I
brushes and the cool thing like that meg
and I are doing here is the fact that
like I got this obviously in the u.s.
mega actually lives overseas so if for
some reason you can't get this exact set
you probably would be able to get the
one that she has I believe she lives in
Vietnam right now so I think you guys
would be able to hopefully get that if
you are overseas um because sometimes
unfortunately if you are overseas you're
not able to get all of these items that
are on Amazon sometimes it's weird like
shipping restrictions and stuff like
that but anyway we thought it would be
cool to kind of just talk about the ones
that we got I know that we did get
different kits I believe so yeah it's
just from like the pro balanced line I
guess you could say this is what like I
said this is what the outer packaging
looks like and here is the inner
packaging with all ten of the brushes
you have some face brushes here and then
some I brushes I think overall this is
pretty darn good for twenty seven
dollars and ninety-five cents like I
said I'm not someone that's like
obsessed with brushes so for me like for
the most part like brushes are good like
I like them if they can get the job done
I'm okay with it but there are a few
brushes in here but I do find a little
scratchy and there are some things that
I think need to be discussed about the
actual like model and make of the actual
brush of that makes sense I think I
never review brushes I don't really know
what to say but let's go ahead and start
with the basics these are synthetic
fibers and this is a nylon handle I will
say the actual handle is very very
Wiggly and jiggly and at first I was
like I hate that house gang stuck in my
hair at first I really hated that
because like I felt like it was really
hard to kind of um place the product
onto my face I felt like I had to hold
it down here which you're not supposed
to do one of the nice luxurious things
about these kind of brushes is the fact
that they have this little handle and it
looks like a mermaid brush being brushed
onto your face but then I realized it
was actually kind of nice because
although they are they are kind of like
Wiggly like this it gives you like a
nice amount of luxury from when you're
putting this on because it's actually
like bending into all the crevices
around your face so and that actually
worked quite well at first I didn't like
it but now I like it and I have someone
who really kind of goes hard with my
makeup if you've ever seen the apply
 on my face like I'm like
you know I really really go fast and
hard so I think this was kind of a nice
way for me to learn how to use things
delicately on my face because you just
kind of swipe it on in circular motions
or you brush it on one thing i will say
about all of these brushes is that i
think they are used they are meant to be
used for swiping motions if you start to
kind of stipple they definitely even
though they are very densely packed with
those synthetic fibers I do find that
they start to get a little streaky so
anyway here is the first brush like I
said every single one does have
synthetic fibers or bristles they're
very very soft or especially this one is
i should say this is my favorite one out
of the entire bunch and this is their
foundation brush and they also say it
can be a powder brush i personally would
not use this for applying like powder
foundation because i feel like with
powder foundation you really need to
kind of buff it into your skin and these
are really meant for just kind of
swiping on to the face now if you would
like to see me use these i will go ahead
and link down below my look at the week
video where i did use quite a few of
these in that video but also let me know
down below if you want a whole tutorial
using every single brush in here and i
can show you how i personally use them
there's a lot of videos out there that
would probably show you a better way to
use them but anyway i thought i would
let you guys know i can day going to
those if you would like me to but yeah
this one is definitely my favorite I
will say one of my biggest complaints
about these is the fact that these
things take forever to dry and I knew
that it would be like that because these
are so freakishly densely packed I knew
that it would take forever this is on
day two of drying and it is still moist
and wet so it unless you live in like
Arizona or something like that this is
going to take a very very long time to
dry we do have kind of like moist air
here we live like near a lake so it has
been taking a very long time for these
brushes to dry I don't know if there is
a quicker way but I have been able to
wash these with any sort of brush
shampoo or my purity made simple facial
cleansing gel and i have not had any
sort of problems i don't feel like there
are tons of little hairs that are coming
out maybe a little bit but i am someone
who is a little more rough too when i
actually wash my brushes so i just
wanted to put that out there but i don't
think there is really any sort of
shedding with these at all so i really
love this one this is my favorite the
biggest brush in the set definitely the
softest if I had to compare this to
anything I would say it's very
comparable to the tort um foundation
brushes those really nice densely packed
like the airbrush what is it called the
air boogie foundation brush that one and
also the one that I got in my Nicole can
see Leo brush set so really really like
this very nice the next one that we have
here is about a step down so here is the
largest one and here's the next one so
this one's about the size of my cheek
you really can get your foundation on
quickly i'm all about that quick life so
I enjoyed that this one is about um not
completely like half the size but it's
pretty darn pretty darn close to about
half the size so this one is nice as you
can see there is a loose little hair
here and I do find that this one sheds a
little more it's not as soft as this one
but it still is very very silky and this
would be my second favorite brush now
you can use this to apply foundation as
well if you don't want something so big
and bulky I like this one for really
blending into my hairline as well and
I'd like to use it underneath my eyes
because the next two brushes i'm going
to show you are kind of meant for the
eye area but they are very scratchy so i
don't like that so that is the second
brush the third brush is we're getting
into the kind of under eye area so this
is what it looks like and it's about
half a step down from the other brush
and this is just like something's
different it just feels completely
different it's just much much much more
scratchy and anytime I put it underneath
my eye area I feel like I'm pulling I
feel like I'm tugging I feel like
they're streaking so this one and the
next one down which looks like this i
would say stay away from the two of
these now these are supposed to be for
under the eye area but what you can do
is obviously use them for other things
you don't have to use brushes
specifically for what they're made for
so what I like to do with these is
actually contour the side of my nose and
actually blend in a little bit of
contour on my face I feel like they work
very well for that because they are very
densely packed sure they're not super
soft and silky I only really like a soft
and silky brush when I'm blending my eye
makeup and also when I am blending at my
foundation in but when it comes to like
my contour and even like highlight or
just like contouring my nose you know I
really don't care so those two brushes
right there I would say go ahead and use
these for those you know those kind of
things like contouring and also just
highlighting and then we have this
little guy here and this one's actually
meant for the nose area so if you want
to contour with this one you can again a
little bit more on the scratchy site it
is a very densely packed but it actually
feels smoother than the two that I've
just showed you so it is pretty darn
good I like how lightweight this is if
you
a little more sturdy on the handle which
is interesting and I do feel like you
can just go right down on the sides of
your nose and contour quickly the next
one we have here looks like this and
this was actually very soft and silky
now we're getting into some more little
brushes that I do like you could do
whatever the hell you want with this I
applied eyeliner with this the other day
and not I lighter but I put like under I
like smoked out my lower lash line you
can also blend out your eye shadow I
tried doing it and it actually worked it
was the weirdest thing ever I've seen
someone actually applied like brow
product with this you can also go ahead
and contour your nose if you want
something a little more defined it's a
really cool little brush I don't have
anything like this in my collection so I
do like that one and then we have one
that looks like this which is about half
the size of this one so I just showed
you guys this one here is the other one
it's kind of like the baby version again
you could really do whatever you want
with this could do your eyebrows you
could do the size of your nose you can
do whatever you want it's a good one as
well and then we have this little one
here which I really really enjoy it is
very soft and it's not very densely
packed as you guys can see and this one
I love for smudging um you know color
underneath my lower lashline it goes on
so softly it is probably the softest
little under I smudger brush that I have
even like beyond my urban decay ones my
elf wants everything I feel like this is
the softest and it goes so nicely it's
so precise and it's just beautiful so
that is what that little brush looks
like and again you could use this for
whatever you want to and then the last
two brushes that we have are these two
little guys and these are kind of like
blending I brushes or you can use them
to spot conceal areas so this little guy
here is a little more short and stubby
he does feel a little crispy to be he
feels a little crispy I do like to go
ahead in put on little areas where I
need concealer I will dot it on
underneath my eyes and then blend it in
with one of the bigger brushes or i will
just spot conceal and I feel like that's
very easy to do with this guy I did try
blending out my eyeshadow with this I
don't think it really worked that well I
do prefer this little guy for the
blending which is weird because it's so
densely packed you think you would do a
good job but it really didn't and then
this guy right here is a lot softer a
lot smoother and as you can see the
bristles are much longer and I do like
this actually for blending out the
eyeshadow so overall out of all 10
brushes I would say my favorites are
definitely the two top face brushes
right here this foundation or powder
brush in this foundation or powder brush
I also really do like these little
guys here I think they're very very cool
and then I would say that the silica
these two guys are pretty darn good I
don't really have like I mean if I had
to choose one that I would say is worth
it and I would pay like twenty dollars
for it would be this foundation brush
actually because this is absolutely
beautiful and i would pay twenty dollars
for this but the other brushes if they
would leave them out i wouldn't be like
super upset about it i think they're
cool and they're a fun way to try
different things with your makeup but
they're not something i would like die
over the ones that I definitely could
live without are these little guys here
I feel like these are kind of um they're
a little harsh on the skin there a
little scratchy you don't really like
that but for the most part i would say
one two three four five six seven like
seven six or seven out of them are good
so six out of ten you have to go ahead
and look at that and think okay is that
worth it for me for twenty seven dollars
and ninety-five cents am i okay with six
out of the ten being good and then the
other ones I find other use for you just
have to decide that for yourself but I
hope that this was somewhat helpful
again I feel like I'm normally reviewing
like makeup and not brushes but
hopefully I gave you guys the
information that you needed to know like
I said definitely go check out Meg's
video if maybe you can't pick this up um
if you're you know across seas and
things like that too but I yeah I think
it's a pretty darn good set I would
consider possibly looking into artiste
brushes but I would never buy like a
full 10 sack because for me that's just
not worth it but for anybody else that
is interested you know i would say
probably the art tees brushes are better
quality than this but i do think that
some of the brushes in here are
comparable to some of the high-end
brushes that i have so i do like them
alright guys that is it for this video
thank you so much for joining me and i
will see you guys tomorrow right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
