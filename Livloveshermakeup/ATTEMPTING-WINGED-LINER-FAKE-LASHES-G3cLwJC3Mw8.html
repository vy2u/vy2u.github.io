channel I was about to fly like my hair
anyway welcome back to my channel today
I am zoomed in a really close because we
are going to be doing something fun now
if you've been watching my channel for a
while you probably know that I kind of
um I got to march to the beat of my own
drum and I'm not trying to be like oh
I'm so special and I'm so unique no
that's not what I'm trying to say what
I'm trying to say is I'm very
comfortable with myself and I'm
comfortable being myself on camera if
that makes sense and along with that
comes the fact that I'm very comfortable
with the way I do my makeup I like to do
things that I like to do and I know a
few of you who do have channels have
asked me how do you deal with people
saying you don't know how to do your
makeup you're doing this wrong you're
doing that wrong
all I have to say is if you do have a
channel and you're getting comments like
that which I get them all the time just
understand that people can only hurt
your feelings if you let them does that
make sense so just just don't let them
hurt your feelings if you're doing what
you love and what you think looks good
then that is all absolutely all that
matters so anyway today the reason why
it's going to be a lot of fun the reason
I'm zoomed in is because I am going to
go ahead and attempt winged eyeliner
over here and also false eyelashes and
then on this I'm you guys were saying
because you're pretty worried that this
is going to look like which I'm
sure it will I'm going to go ahead and
apply just false eyelashes over here
with a little bit of eye shadow this is
something that I don't ever do because I
just don't want to and I don't think
there's absolutely there's really
nothing wrong with that okay there's
nothing wrong with not going to do the
norm or doing what other people do if
you do have your own channel being
unique is a good thing and if you don't
want to pile on the makeup and you don't
want to wear false eyelashes and you
don't want to do winged eyeliner you
don't have to and for me personally also
I just don't know how to do it and I am
not ashamed of saying that I don't think
it's a big deal you know not everybody
on YouTube is a makeup artist and that
is 100% okay so anyway the reason why I
am doing this is because so many of you
have requested it I know a lot of you do
have issues with um you know winged
eyeliner as well and also putting on
false eyelashes so this vide hope this
video will hopefully be entertaining for
you guys I hope I hope it will be funny
and I hope you will enjoy it so let's go
ahead and jump right into it and the
eyeliner that I
have here is a little deluxe a sample of
the Kat Von D tattoo liner waterproof
liquid eyeliner initiate Mad Max Brown a
lot of you were saying if I'm going to
attempt this I should do a brown
eyeliner just because if I do like
completely black it may look even worse
but yeah this is what it looks like it's
so so so scary but I'm going to attempt
a wing here and I just want to say
really quickly I have worn false
eyelashes three times in my life and two
of them have been applied by makeup
artist one time I did it myself it did
not it did not go very well and then as
far as liquid eyeliner is concerned I've
only ever done it once and I actually
filmed myself not doing it but I filmed
myself after so it was a video that I
first posted like when I first started
my channel I think I think I honestly
deleted it because everyone was like
what the is going on with your eyes
and back then with my older videos you
guys know I was a little more insecure
and I was worried about like I felt like
I had to fit in with all these group of
people so um yeah anyway we're gonna go
ahead and do this so I really only have
tried it honestly once and we're gonna
see how this goes so a lot of people are
saying it to go ahead and pull your eye
a taut and then start with the wing line
is that considered a wing I feel like
that's kind of a wing and then here
we're just gonna go ahead and kind of
fill it in it's not bad is it it's not
really close to the lash line but I
don't feel like it's horrible
let's go ahead and do this as well okay
I kind of did I kind of actually did it
I'm very surprised this is a super super
easy little eyeliner to work with um
let's see if we can kind of fill it in a
little more I don't want to go crazy and
have it be too big but yeah I
feel like I'm kind of flying what do you
guys think do you think it looks okay
maybe I should make this wing a little
bigger let's go ahead and see if I can
kinda oh oh don't fix it if it ain't
broke right guys alright so there is my
wing on this side there's a little gap
here so I'm just gonna go ahead and do
that like I said I really have never
done this and I'm not trying to be like
oh my god look I did a wing I honestly
thought this was gonna be so much worse
than it is
I have watched so many youtube videos
that I do
remember people like doing this so that
is the wing there's me attempting wing
eyeliner guys I don't think it
necessarily look that great on my eyes
because I don't think that I have the
sort of eye shape that can really rock a
wing by the way if you're curious I'm
already wearing um eyeliner on my like
tight line and also my waterline it is
the it cosmetics note tub waterproof
anti-aging gel eyeliner in the shade
black and then I did also put on a
little bit of my highlighter on my
actual eyelid a lot of you are saying do
not put vehicle litter and glows
on your eyelid and then attempt winged
eyeliner I guess it's super super
difficult but this is what it looks like
the shade is called oh my god it is just
a really really pretty champagne
highlight so I just kind of tap that all
over my eye but yeah there it is guys so
there is my wing I feel like it looks a
little on the weak side but I'm super
scared to try and touch it up a little
more let's just try a little bit Michael
L up but that's okay um so I'm
just gonna try and build a little more
uh-oh but yeah a lot of people were
always telling me to start with the
little wing and then go inward so that
is it there's my way you guys what do
you think I look like a little baby wig
but at least it is a wing so yeah this
is just something that I can't really
see myself rocking I feel like it
doesn't look good on my eye shape I
don't know why I have very very round
eyes but sometimes when I do put like
water
um waterline when I put eyeliner on my
waterline they look a little smaller but
I don't know sorry my lips are all gross
because I was just practicing but yeah I
just I don't know I don't know I don't
feel like this is the kind of thing that
I would personally like to wear on a
day-to-day basis but that is it there's
my little baby wing alright guys so now
let's go ahead and jump into the false
eyelashes so I got these little
eyelashes here these are the batting
team and batting Tigers but Beddington
lashes I got these in a PopSugar
must-have box you guys know I'm no
longer subscribed to them because they
are not a cruelty free subscription box
but this is what they look like and I
feel like those look huge like
Gitlow huge they did come with eyelash
glue and this is what it looks like so
many people were like oh that's gonna be
horrible you're gonna be so scared to
use that eyelash glue and I am very
frightened I did take the little cap
thing off and you had to actually cut
you had to cut the little spout right
there so
don't know how this is going to work out
it looks like it's going to come out a
lot at once I have like q-tips ready to
go and stuff like that now on this other
eye because like I said I'm not gonna do
a wing on this one cuz a lot of you were
worried about you wanted to see like
what just the eyelashes with eye shadow
look like I'm gonna put a little bit of
eye shadow over on at the right hand
side so I'm gonna take my violet boss
Holy Grail palette which go figure I
will be using tomorrow for a tutorial
for you guys I know it's funny Here I am
can't do winged eyeliner and I can't do
false eyelashes I'm still gonna do an
eye tutorial I feel like there are a few
things that I kind of know how to do
with makeup so or at least I feel
comfortable with so anyway let's go
ahead and put a little bit of thanks a
lot a with this morphe brush I'm just
going to take this and Pat it all over
the eyelid and go all the way up to the
brow and then I'm going to take the
shade at transition which is just this
really nice kind of warm tone color
right here and I'm going to work that
into my crease and I'm also taking it
down on to my actual eyelid just so we
have like a little bit of color going on
I don't know how like I was gonna say
Ramesh's if we lashes yeah I don't know
how actual lashes go on without winged
eyeliner like I don't know how good it
will look but a few of you were asking
and now let's just take this little
appointed pencil brush right here with
that shade and transition again I'm just
going to go ahead and smoke that out on
the lower lash line really really
quickly just so we have like a little
bit of color going on alright guys so
let's go ahead and put a false eyelash
over here I'm so scared right now
alright so here is the little lashes I'm
gonna go ahead and peel it off okay I've
seen people go like this in videos
before like mmm-hmm I'm kind of like
mmhmm
kind of making it look like it would it
would fit onto my eye this thing is
 huge okay I do have my
left-handed scissors here if I need to
trim them so we shall see how that goes
but let me put some of this eyelash glue
on ah ah so my friend Jess who's amazing
at makeup a link her channel down below
she was like be very careful let the
eyelash glue sit for 30 seconds
it's all over oh my god okay let me
get a q-tip
damnit she was telling me Oh God all
over lash that shed okay she was
telling me to let it kind of sit and get
tacky for 30 seconds which I feel like
I've seen people do that's not
everywhere okay I'm just gonna put it on
to the q-tip and then on to the eyelash
is that okay I feel like there's people
shouting through the screen right now no
no no but I'm going to do it anyway
alright so let's go ahead and oh my god
it's all over the lash you guys oh my
god my left handedness is failing me
right now okay there how's that look
horrible right horrible
alright so let's kind of bend it like
this and let it kind of shake for 30
seconds yeah I know what I'm doing I
know what I'm doing oh it's all over my
fingers
horrible alright and now we're just
gonna oh oh dear Lord oh my god oh
my god ah I can do this I can do this I
believe in you Liv I believe in you
okay this eyelash is hella long I'm
going to trim on the other side okay
it's not sticking it's not sticking okay
uh-uh-uh-uh 1 2 3 4 5 I feel beautiful
okay I feel beautiful alright i luckily
can't blink it feels horrible how do you
ladies do this how do you wear eyelashes
everyday probably because they're not
this dramatic but this is all I had in
my collection sitting around alright I'm
just gonna let it kind of sit there
let's go ahead and put on some mascara
so I so I don't look crazy this is the
ink automatic superhero mascara it's
still like coming off but um this is the
it cosmetics superhero a lot of you were
saying to use this one cuz it works
really well with false eyelashes I don't
 know I don't know I don't know
alright let's go ahead and okay this is
literally just lifting the actual lash
off this is not buying Wow ladies I
think the wing actually went better and
the lashes how do I look mmm okay let's
go ahead and try the other one I feel
like I didn't put enough glue on that
end let's trim them a little bit as well
let me put just a little
Marvis on because if we're gonna go big
or go home on the top we better go ahead
and clump up those lower lashes again
one of my favorite things ever clumpy
lashes okay so there it is you can't
even see my wink because these eyelashes
doubt these eyelashes okay so now let's
go ahead and put a little more eyelash
glue on the other side again I'm going
to put it on this first and then on the
eyelash because that to not work
let's go ahead and trim it a little
first as well so let me take my little
lefty scissors and let me just take a
chunk off cuz these are these are some
damn big lashes she did all right I'm
just gonna oh alright still look
huge I'm gonna do a little bendy thank

every single day Congrats to the new
ladies out there who do this every day
because I can't do this

enough I think you're supposed to put
mascara on first and then winged
eyelashes it like I said we need
