video is going to be my August 2016
glossybox unboxing so if you are curious
to see what I got in my box then please
keep on watching so the first thing that
I saw when I opened it up yes I did
already peak I normally don't but
GlossyBox is my favorite subscription
service and honestly it got here really
late this month so let me know down
below if that happened to you as well
but the first thing you see is the
little pamphlet that tells you all about
the products and I will let you guys
know the price on everything so the
first item that was in here are these
little Invisibles these are the
traceless hair rings you get three in
here and it helps so that you don't have
headaches no split and strong grip all
hair types and they are traceless so
it's super super cute these are
basically just these really stretchy
little hair bands and I guess that your
hair wraps around them and I think
that's adorable I love the color and
three pieces retails for eight dollars
alright the next item that is in here is
the Too Faced mascara melt off this is a
cleansing oil it is it helps to dissolve
waterproof mascara I did not like this I
actually went three full sides of this
and I haven't decluttered it yet because
I actually passed it along to my mom but
I don't like this because basically it's
like a mascara wand and you put it on
your lashes you leave it for a few
seconds and then you wash it off it
works really well but you guys you're
getting all the extra little bits of
mascara on the brush and then back into
the tube so I will go ahead and
declutter this when i do my declutter
series and probably send that to my
friend rochelle see if she likes it the
next thing I might have in my box is the
Wella Professionals oil reflections
smoothing oil this is what it looks like
it looks like a really thick oil spray
so I'm pretty excited to try that and
let's see here one of the top
ingredients in here is coconut oil which
is great for your hair so I can't smell
anything but I think hopefully will be
good I really love GlossyBox GlossyBox
is my all-time favorite subscription so
normally I'm pretty happy with
everything that I get and I will be
doing a video soon on all of my
subscription boxes talking about which
one would be best for you alright so the
next item that we oh by the way the
two-phase mascara melta for a full size
is 17 and that hair oil is twenty
dollars for one fluid ounce all right
here we have the Borg Borgese fan go
then go active mud for face and body um
it says let's see here cleansing mud
mask for face and body that's
darn cool so this is what it looks like
you can use it you guys know I love to
mass so you can use this on your body
like your date a and your neck and also
just on your face so let's see here this
little guy is a pretty decent sized I
feel like this is around yeah about one
ounce of product here and in full size
is due $37 47 ounces which is a lot
alright the next thing I might have here
is the lay at play Sony this is the
after sun lotion in perfume on I like
monoi oil monoi oil is that how you say
it it says apply milk on a clean dry
skin after sun exposure performing
gentle circular massage the emphasis on
dry areas in sunburn for an intense tan
and a longer can you guys know i don't
actually tan in the sun because my lupus
but i do self tan so we shall try that
out and in full size that that is let's
see here so weird I feel like there's so
much stuff in here one is point 7 fluid
ounces is twelve dollars alright the
next item I have here is the trifle
cosmetics that this is a lip balm i'm
guessing has a pub on it that is way way
way way too cute like i can't i can't
even let me open it up okay just
literally chipped off my nail polish
super cute love it alright let's just
open it like that you know what is not a
lip balm i was hoping it was but the
shade is called guilty pug it's actually
a lipstick so there is the color it
looks like it might be quite
moisturizing which would be great yeah
it's like very very sheer and kind of
moisturizing this is the kind of lip
product that i would probably like so
there it is and it still has a little
plastic thing on there now always lovely
there we go yeah go live alright and
that item list see here that is April
sighs and it is nineteen dollars and
that is the guys that is everything that
I got in this month's GlossyBox I would
say it's a pretty good box I've gotten
better but again GlossyBox is only 21
dollars a month and I do feel like you
get more than what the box is worth so
anyway that is it let me know down below
if you've got something different and I
will see you guys next month bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
