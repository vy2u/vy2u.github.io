morning i hope you are all having a
wonderful friday so far i have three
different videos going up for you guys
today so feel free to cherry pick
whatever you would like to watch this
first video is going to be my August
2016 I was going to say ypsi a bad guy
nope August 2016 sephora play box
unboxing and then at 5pm i will have a
drugstore makeup haul collab video going
up and then at 7pm i have a review
swatches and can comparison that review
swatches in comparison on the new makeup
geek kathleenlights highlighting palette
so anyway three video is going up today
like i said feel free to cherry pick
what you want to watch but this video is
going to be my august 2016 i was going
to say FB again Pat dammit August 2016
sephora play unboxing so this is the
little couch that we got this month you
have a little winky I there and then as
always we have the little on card right
here which gives you 50 extra bonus
point and then you open it up and it
will tell you a little more about the
products I have peaked a little bit and
I'm not going to read off the products
in here because I have tried most of
them so I can kind of give you guys my
thoughts but the first one that I have
in my bag is the Lancome the smoothing
and glow boosting liquid care this is a
sample that I have tried before I really
like this energy to be or energy Debbie
a line from Lancome it's really really
wonderful I do like their instant
smoothing melting mask and this one is
actually like a liquid moisturizer it
almost has the consistency of a serum
but it's very very light weight on the
skin so this is the first item that i
got and I'm very excited if i remember
correctly the smells really good so I'm
excited about that to you guys know I
like fragrance all right speaking of
fragrance I did get a perfume this month
and it smells amazing i did already
spray this on it is the clean what is
this blonde rose perfume and it says it
has floral musk and rose in here and it
smells really really good so this is
what it looks like like i said i already
sprayed a little bit but you guys know I
love the scent of rose and I can
definitely smell a little bit of musk
and sample wood in here as well so I'm
super excited and I think I would
definitely consider purchasing a full
size of that I also got the Urban Decay
perversion bigger blacker bad or mascara
you guys know I have a full size of this
and also a few deluxe ice samples it
comes
really nice gun metal packaging like
this and a happy very very fluffy wand
and this is a very very slick and wet a
formulation so if you do have really
oily eyelids you just want to take extra
precaution with this I don't know if
they have a waterproof version I don't
think they do but this is a very good
mascara I do like it for building up a
volume and length on my lashes the next
item we have here is the code early
resveratrol eye lifting bomb and I have
gone through a full size of this this is
a very very nice lightweight sort of gel
consistency eyeball now you would think
because it says balm that it would be
very very heavy but it actually is very
very light weight on the skin so I
really do like this product and Tom and
my boyfriend really likes this as well
because it has respiratory net he's a
doctor and he claims that resveratrol is
very good for your skin so excited for
that I also got a Make Up For Ever
artist shadow in the shape that I got is
6p 0 1 which is a beautiful kind of topi
color and I feel like I maybe have this
in the artist palette number one but I'm
not quite sure let me go ahead and
swatch it for you guys if you have never
tried out these artists shadows before
they're very nice they have sort of like
a foiled consistency to them and they go
on sort of foiled really really
beautiful if I could compare them to
anything I would say they're very very
comparable to the makeup geek soiled
eyeshadows and also they are very
comparable to the charts rainforests of
these see eyeshadow palettes so if you
own that one you would probably like
this one and then the last item that I
have in this month's box is or this
month's bag i should say is the sephora
contour i pencil 12 hour wherein the
waterproof version and the shade is
called let's see here something flirty
flirting game number 15 flirting game it
looks like it's a beautiful beautiful
kind of taupe color let me go ahead and
do a little swatch a room for you guys
oh it's very soft it's like a coal kind
of pencil yeah very nice so there is
swatched on the back of my hand and it
seems quite nice it is retractable
please tell me its retractable it is
retractable so yeah that's a beautiful
beautiful color and it says it's
waterproof so hopefully it will be nice
on the waterline alright guys that is
everything that I got in this month
Sephora play box I hope you enjoyed this
video thank you so much for joining me
and I will see you guys again at five
p.m. and 7pm bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
