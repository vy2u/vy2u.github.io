channel today's video is going to be all
about my August 2017 MPs so if you are
interested in seeing the products I used
up this month and please keep on
watching
alright there was a lot of Bath care in
skin care but there were two makeup
products that I did use up the first one
of course is an essence all about matte
16 contact powder I love this would
repurchase you guys know I go through
that powder like I go through friggin
water and second of all we have the elf
brow pencil in taupe I was so mad when
I've used this up because this is like
my new favorite brow pencil it is
cruelty free it has a really nice kind
of waxy form you like to it though you
don't have to like sit there and scrape
your eyebrows on that's how I feel about
the anasazi Beverly Hills brow is which
is what I have on today I actually have
to go back and forth in my brows to even
get any color payoff which drives me
crazy so if you do like more of a waxy
sort of pencil that you can move around
a little bit on your eyebrows this is
fantastic and it's only like three
dollars but would definitely repurchase
that next up I have a handle here from
which city which I burned through the
line patchouli handcrafted soy candle it
was great it is vegan it was cruelty
free with lead free wicks I felt like it
burned very evenly as far as the wax is
concerned but you guys can see it there
is a lot of search build up at the top
so if these are on sale I definitely
would consider purchasing another one
next up I did use up the ordinary books
a multi technology peptide serum I
really did enjoy this I would consider
repurchasing I felt like it was really
nice when I first started using it I did
get a little bit of skin irritation I
just wanted to let you guys know if you
saw my tips in this video on the
ordinary skin care which although I
hadn't throw up in the cards you know
that I did have a little bit of issues
with this when I first started that
there was just something in here that
bugs me I'm a bump to my skin it made it
very raw and chapped and very very dry
but that has now gone away and every
time I use it my skin looks really nice
have a nice consistency to it it does
leave your skin a little tacky but when
I follow up with a moisturizer I really
really like how my skin looks so I do
enjoy that like I said I would consider
repurchasing next up we have the formula
1006 keep your cool skin calming gel
mask with coconut and cucumber
unfortunately this one bad in my
collection I feel like I just have way
too many masks that are open currently
in my collection and the way that I
could tell that this one went bad was
because of the consistency it was
incredibly running
tiled right out when I would open the
cap which I'm not going to do now but I
wanted to go everywhere I was really
disappointed because formula 1006 have
some great math one of my all-time
favorite math is the bergamot and orange
one and I really do like that so I need
to make sure that I am getting through
my mask before opening up a new one so
would not repurchase it so I cannot
think that formula 1006 is cruelty free
all right moving on I did use up two
products from a glam glow I really
really love glam glow but unfortunately
they do test on animals so I would not
repurchase the first is a thirsty mess
hydrating treatment and a full-size and
then the dream duo over night
transforming treatment in April sighs
this guy has like a iridescent kind of
pink serum that you put on and then this
feel and you let it stay overnight on
your skin it definitely does moisturize
I noticed this is can make me break out
if I use it too many nights in a row so
if you do end up picking that up and
you're not pearl tea for you I would
recommend only using it probably once a
week and then this guy right here I
think I found a dupe or at the drugstore
so let me know if you guys would like me
to you talked a little bit about that as
the cruelty free soup as well as a
cheaper alternative all right moving on
we have the philosophy purity it made
simple one-step facial cleanser I used
to use this to wash my makeup brushes
this was a big 16 fluid ounce container
but unfortunately would not repurchase
philosophy does test on animals are you
moving on we have the charts charts bars
sunscreen lotion with broad-spectrum SPF
30 I love this I would repurchase it's a
really really nice physical sunblock
so it has titanium dioxide as well as
zinc oxide in it if you do have more
sensitive skin this is a great option if
your breakout from sunscreens definitely
get a physical sunblock instead of a
chemical sunblock and yeah I really like
it has a nice scent to it it's not too
greasy on the skin really really good
product right there alright moving on I
did use up some bath bombs and double
bars and stuff like that so the first
one was actually from Whole Foods and
this was called be fizzing a bath bomb
inroad kettle it was actually pretty
nice of only $2.99 so I would consider
refresh today I did use up luscious rose
Shambo balloon and this was beautiful
really loved the scent it definitely
does moisturize the skin and also leaves
your a water super super pink and pretty
and then this bag right here is yuzu and
cocoa this is also a bubble rune it
smells amazing it reminds me of like
coconut chocolate and a little bit of
like you know citrus in it so I really
did like that would repurchase let's see
here this guy right here with the fizz
bang or bubble bar actually enjoyed this
I'm sorry this is a banger
bath bomb I normally don't love bath
bombs but the pool is also quite nice so
I probably would repurchase as well here
we have these blue skies and fluffy like
clouds that bubble bar I love this if
you really like the scent to like
patchouli and really fresh bubbles you
would enjoy this and then here we have
the comforter bubble bar which is my
all-time favorite product for lush it
smells really sweet like candy and I
really do enjoy it so would repurchase
all right here we have another rich city
wicks candle I love the little heart on
here I think that's so cool this what we
called rosewood must definitely my
favorite scents from them it's amazing
it just kind of smoke with a bonfire
with a little bit of sweetness so when
you enjoy that would repurchase I did
use up two different oil cleansers that
I definitely would repurchase the first
one in the elf nourishing oils to foam
cleanser this retails for I believe $10
you do get 5 fluid ounces of product in
here which is great and then the Burt's
Bees cleansing oil with coconut and
argan oil for normal to dry skin
100% natural 6 fluid ounces for around
$15 love this as well with repurchase
moving on we have V about the body work
stress relief cedar wood and sage body
wash and foam bath so I no longer
purchase from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works a lot of
people consider them to be cruelty free
I was just having such a hard time
getting a definitive answer from them
and it kind of drove me crazy and left a
bad taste in my mouth so that's why I
won't be purchasing from them further
but this did smell really good and I
feel like their products from the
aromatherapy line moving on we have the
glam glow thirsty cleanse daily
hydrating cleanser I did not like this I
liked it when I first started using in
that in the after a while I did not if
you are going to get one of these
cleansers and you don't purchase
products that are just cruelty free I
would recommend getting the exfoliating
one I feel like that's the best one that
you can get in the black tube alright
moving on we have the detox dry shampoo
from dry bar I do having love-hate
relationship with this product I really
like that it sucks up all the oil in my
hair but also leaves it very crispy so I
might repurchase we'll see let's see
here my boyfriend did use up the dr.
George water drop hydrating a
moisturizer he said it was pretty nice I
did not like the consistency on this it
was super super slimy and I was not a
fan so probably would not repurchase
moving on
you have become nutrition skinny burn
and this is basically our weight-loss
program I'm not trying to lose weight
but I have talked about it before I used
to suffer from a bulimia I did have a
pretty severe eating disorder and I'm
one of those people that just really
likes to binge on food it's not in a
healthy way and if you guys would like
me to do a whole story about like my
bulimia experience I would be more than
happy to do that it's something that I
feel like I can talk about very openly
now because I have been totally fine for
about four or five years now but this is
something that really helps me if I feel
like I want to binge as I have to like
eat until I feel absolutely stuff it's
nice to take one of these because it
kind of calmed down on like a craving
I'm wanting to steal stuff I don't know
why I'm so obsessed with that feeling
but it's just something that I am really
into if you follow me on snapchat you
probably notice I eat a lot of food and
yeah this is one of those things that
does help me so I don't take it the way
you're supposed to if you do want to
lose weight definitely go check with
your doctor first to make sure this is
okay but this is the vegan and
vegetarian product you choose um get
these at Sephora
and it basically in here they have 5-htp
green tea and then they also do have
chromium which helps with blood sugar so
it's something that my doctor said I
could take and they said I take probably
one a day whenever I feel like I want to
binge on food and then here I have a
little Gillette Venus spa breeze this
was like a little razor head I do
believe that this brand is like
affiliated with us something that tests
on animals so I would not repurchase it
was one of those razor heads that has
like be really moisturizing a little
bars like soap on each end so that I
don't cut while you're shaving but I
have shaving gels that I really enjoy so
would not repurchase let's see here the
karez black pine firming lifting and
anti-wrinkle night cream I don't like
this I like a lot of products from crust
but this guy is just not good I don't
like the scent they just send me a
full-size of the black pine firming at
night oil a while ago I also didn't like
that so I don't know if it's just the
scent that's driving me crazy but I
don't feel like this does much so would
not repurchase
here we have a little mini of the drunk
elephant TLC friend with like colic a
night serum I feel like this is
identical to the NIP plus bath like
colic acid serum so I would not
purchasing both sides of that and
finally be happy believes the true creme
aqua bond I love this my boyfriend loves
this my mom loves it
funny things to love them I need to
double check on their cruelty-free
status but if they don't test would
definitely purchase this great
especially in the morning if you want to
use it a little bit as like a primer and
a moisturizer in one so anyway guys
those are all the products like you said
we just hit one of my life those are all
the products I used up this month I hope
