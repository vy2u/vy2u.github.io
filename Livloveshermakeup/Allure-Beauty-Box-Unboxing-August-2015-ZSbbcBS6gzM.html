thank you for joining me this video is
going to be an unboxing of my allure
beauty box for the month of August so
August 2015 unboxing of my beauty box
from a lower so let's just get started I
haven't looked inside yet so it comes in
this cute little red box you open it up
and you get your little pamphlet there
that talks about the products which I
will read to you guys and this is what
is in there for this month so let's get
started I was going to say let's get
through it but I don't mean it like that
let's get started and go through it and
talk about what's in here so the first
thing I see is from the Salma Hayek
nuance collection this is the am / PM
anti-aging super cream with tepesch
white lily hey Kenny no make it easy at
the carpet no sigh be I scraping I mean
ripping at the garbage shredding my face
um anyway this is the nuance by salma
hayek am / PM anti-aging super cream
with tepid shoe white borage oil and
vitamins A and E so it comes in this
cute little box and inside oh so cute so
I have tried a few things by her this
line before actually just one thing it
was the retinol capsules which I did
like um and they all come in this little
kind of packaging so this is so cute
such a tiny little tiny little thing but
it looks like it's a really nice kind of
thick cream so I am excited it does have
a little bit of a cent nothing too
offensive so let's read about what the
other people say about it so they say
the nuance salma hayek am / PM
anti-aging super cream what it is a
medium weight facial moisturizer that's
packed with skin protecting antioxidants
what it does is softens and plumps dry
skin without feeling heavy the key
ingredients are glycerin which
moisturizes garage oil which soothes
tempest you aight and parsley reduce
inflammation and vitamins A and E which
are antioxidants how it looks / feel /
smells this white cream has a think
herbal scent it feels substantial going
on a but absorbs quickly and
that's why we like it the nighttime
moisturizers are different are
definitely an exception to this famous
line about how you can't be too rich or
too thin this cream strikes the perfect
balance just thick enough to be a
coddling but still silky enough to sink
in without an oily trace we want to call
it an anti-aging power house but intense
hydration should be shouldn't be
underestimated dryness is a major major
cause of aging we all talk about some
damage but a big reason that there is
aging is because it damages the skin's
moisture barrier so its genetic or graph
I was going to say Garf no graph I
kinetograph and she is a dermatologist
in Great Neck New York it says once you
breach that fortress free radicals and
pollutants get in and cause wrinkles so
1.4 ontas which of course this is not
this is just a tiny level sample size is
in 1999 and you can buy it at CVS
alright it's cool moving on the next
thing I see is from a vein which is a I
believe French brand but I really
personally like and this is there a
cleansing gel for oily blemish prone
skin and that looks so awesome i'm going
to actually use this tonight because i
love using um you know like an acne or
any kind of and i guess anti-aging acne
kind of gel like at night time to
cleanse my skin especially during the
summer i think the gels are so
refreshing and but it looks like this
and it just looks really really nice so
um that's a read about it it says the
oath irma of being cleansing gel it says
a foaming cleanser for oily and acne
prone skin what it does it lifts away
grease and makeup without stripping the
skin can you see my cat up on the
refrigerator wait she's getting a low
rowdy um it says yes sorry it says that
listen we grease and makeup without
stripping the skin and helps regulate
oil production the key ingredients are
zinc and mana Lauren which is great cuz
zinc shoes and mana Lauren reduces oil
production it says how it looks and
feels and smells a
little of this teal colored gel goes a
very long way that a standard bottle
should last a year seriously a dot size
a pencil eraser foams to clean the whole
entire face and I do believe it I feel
like gel cleansers go really really long
way so I'm sure this is what the full
size looks like so I'm sure that even
this little odd deluxe size will go a
very long way it says why we like it Oh
thermal Evans plenty on line was created
to treat acne but this supremely gentle
cleanser doesn't contain harsh salicylic
acid or benzyl peroxide instead it's got
a new ingredient called mono Lauren
that's been proven to decrease oil
production over time with regular loose
regular use that's an obvious bone for
the sig prone and for anyone else the
formula also clean so thoroughly you'll
want to reach for it after a workout or
on a humid summer day so for six point
seven six ounces which is the full size
which looks like that it is twenty
dollars um but still I feel like this
one right here will go a very long way
this is 1.69 fluid ounces let's take a
smell let's see oh come on my lip oh it
smells really really nice like really
really good so I'm excited to try that
out I'm going to use this tonight I'm
very very excited um alright moving on
the next thing I see is from Mullen and
glitz and this is the peppermint shampoo
with one percent peppermint extract for
all hair types it also has amino acid
hydration technology so let's smell it
because I love anything minty oh my gosh
Oh smells great that's going to be so
nice I hope that it lathers really
really well um because it smells really
really good it says our gentle hydrating
shampoo synthesizes natural peppermint
extract with amino acids to help cleanse
the scalp effectively purifies and
balances all hair and scalp types unlike
traditionally harsh detergents so really
really excited to try that I wrote it's
just a tiny little size but that's okay
it's a good enough sample size to try
out so let's read about it alright to
moline plus go x ah melon I don't know
it sounds like it's like Swedish my name
post-coital peppermint shampoo what it
is a gentle clarifying shampoo with a
knockout time so it's actually a
clarifying shampoo so this will actually
last you a long time since you only
really need to clarify your hair um you
know once a month or even just you know
once a week once a month that kind of
thing depending on your hair type I do
it once a week personally what it is a
gentle clarifying shampoo with a Mac
absent what it does produces heaps of
minty lather that whisk away every bit
of grind grease and hair product gunk
the key ingredients are ammonium lauryl
sulfate which cleanses glycerin which
moisturizes pan fall strengthens and
peppermint which removes build-up how it
looks feels and smells the peppermint is
fresh I I opening and curiously strong
as a tin of altoids wow it said be
prepared to rinse like you mean it
because the clear gel produces a lot of
lather yeah I just said I hope that a
lot of love I love a shampoo that lather
certainly well you guys have a
recommendation please leave it below why
we like it we absolutely love the way
this smells and we think it's totally
okay to buy a shampoo putte a shampoo
kiraly for the scent I also agree with
that the nice thing about Molly and plus
coex peppermint stand out is that it
also happens to be really really clean
really really well once you're busy
enjoying the studs on your head our oily
haired editors were most enthusiastic
about the stuffs cleansing powers but
our testers with fine and dry here like
also liked it too it doesn't strictly
here despite all of that lab there once
one thing to note men love the shampoo
if you're a man enjoy if you aren't we
prepare your husband / boyfriend /
roommate to steal it with impunity so
the price for a full size which is 8
fluid ounces is twenty dollars so this
is not a full size it is one ounce but
it is the clarifying shampoo so this
will ask you a long time alright moving
on the next thing I see is the allure
and butter london CO and it is a
beautiful nail polish it looks like it
is like I not like the color of my lips
almost it's like a your lips but better
sort of color if that makes sense it's
really really pretty
kind of muted understated pinky color
and it is in the sweet spot that is the
color on this is not a full size but
that's okay because nail polishes last a
long time I might paint my nails that
color tonight all I have on right now is
little chunks of glitter um all right so
it says violence revenge and the sweet
spot nail lacquers from a lure and
butter london arm candy collection so
they clapped obviously it says what they
are 27 free colors from alors new
collaboration with butter london why we
like them while we created them so
there's that the dusty mob is the one
we're looking for we've been looking for
forever and that is the 1i got the dusty
mauve is the sweet spot and it says it's
feminine without being girly and cool
without being pretentious when we named
it the sweet spot we weren't kidding
then there's violets revenge purple
nails can look cheap and bright blue
tends to look summary and nautical but
this electric violin is the perfect
combination of both mixing the fun
quality from purple with the richness of
cobalt so far point 4 ounces this is
open cero point2 and it is fifteen
dollars wait fifteen 40.4 ounces 34 40.2
ounce bottles so you would get four of
these four thirty dollars and the other
color that I guess other people got was
that kind of bluish color I'm happy that
I got the muted mob one I feel like I'm
really feeling those kind of colors
right now for nails so that's great the
next thing I see in my box is a little
bit of bumble and bumble it says BB
booming cream and it looks like this
obviously it's not a full size but we
will see what this is what it's all
about let's read about it shall we it's
a bumble and bumble grooming cream what
it is a lightweight styling cream that
smoothes frizz boosts waves in your hair
if it has a slight Bend and adds texture
to fine hair in other words it does a
lot key ingredients are PE g10 soy
sterile which softens avocado and sweet
almond oils which moisturize and then it
also has a hobo castor and safflower
safflower seed oils
flower yes safflower safflower seed oils
would add a shine on how it looks and
feels and smells this white cream feels
a little greasy coming out of the tube
we had to urge to wash our hands
immediately after applying but thins out
once you work it through your hair it
has a faint old-time barbershop scent
and why we like it too after a few weeks
of testing we started viewing this cream
like a good body lotion some something
you'll want to apply daily after your
shower if you have any natural wave work
an acorn size blob through damp hair for
a sexy bitch you look if you're going
for a smooth blow out the cream reduces
frizz nicely plus it also plays well
with others if you lose use it alongside
surf spray or boost to boost volume and
our cool curls it keeps other products
from feeling crunchy the price is thirty
dollars for five ounces and like I said
this is not a full size this is point
five fluid ounces but it is a good
enough size to try it out alright and
the last thing that even my Oakland
Apple society box for the month of
August is the benefit they're real
push-up liner lash hugging gel liner pen
and it comes in the cute little box like
that I do have one of these but I
haven't really used it enough so maybe
having this will get me to kind of use
it a little more I believe this is like
for your upper lash line to really push
in and this is the little size that they
have and you pull that little thing off
and this is what the applicator looks
like so um let me read for you guys
exactly what it's all about it says
right there um in here it says do
benefit they're real push-up liner what
it is an allure best of beauty and
breakthrough award winning gel eyeliner
isn't easy to use pen form how it looks
and feels this innovative click pen
delivers black gel eyeliner through a
slit in an angular rubber tip why we
like it it has a smooth where opacity
opacity it's opaque is it ok City
opacity I don't know ok stay stay in
power there's a lot that you love about
this gel liner the one
one have all of the benefits without you
having to wield or carry a brush a one
an allure breakthrough award for taking
the hassle out of getting the results of
a classic gel you just twist the small
dial on the bottom to release the
perfect amount of gel into the flexible
slanted tip of the pen as the waterproof
formula steeps out onto a narrow slit in
the skinny end of the tip the wider base
gently pushes lashes out the way so that
you can get out of the way so that you
can get as close to the lash line as
possible so basically like tight lining
really easily and and let's see it says
some tricks we learn the hard way to
avoid clump and uneven application wiper
tip before each use and once it goes on
it stays on so be sure to have an eye
makeup remover nearby for touch-ups
price is twenty-four dollars for a full
size and you can get it at sephora.com
so anyway those were all the products
that were in my allure sample society
box for the month of August I'm pretty
happy with this one I would say the
things i'm most excited about are
definitely the oven cleanser i'm
definitely going to try this tonight
with my clarisonic um and also probably
the moline plus go it's peppermint
shampoo everything else still looks
really good and I am obviously going to
try but those are the things that kind
of grabbed my attention right away so
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
unboxing if you did please give this
video thumbs up and I'll see you in my
next 15</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
