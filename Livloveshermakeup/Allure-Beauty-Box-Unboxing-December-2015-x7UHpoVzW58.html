thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a fantastic day as
always today I am unboxing for you guys
I feel like I have not done unboxing in
a hot minute but I am unboxing the
December 2015 allure of beauty box i
have not peaked in here yet i'm very
very excited allora beauty box is
fifteen dollars a month it's not my
all-time favorite subscription box
glossybox is my all-time favorite but it
is up there with one of my favorites I
guess you could say I'm like I said it
is fifteen dollars a month i will link
below where you guys can purchase this
box if you are interested i am not
affiliated with them in any way i paid
for this with my own money um but i
usually am very very happy and impressed
with what i get in here like i said i do
prefer glossybox and i also love my
popsugar must have box um but ya know i
really do like allure also i think that
you do get a nice little assortment of
things in here they give you a nice
little pamphlet that describes how you
should use everything and what it is and
i would say i usually end up purchasing
probably one full-size you know product
that basically is in the box so anything
that i really really enjoy i end up
purchasing a full size up so anyway
let's just get right into it shall we so
this is what to the box and looks like
and you open it up and you can see the
little pamphlet on the top and then
there's tissue wrapping of course and a
few different little um like cards and
these are basically just like you know I
don't know it's it's just like little um
sponsored cards basically it says
sponsor product Oh lower beauty box
enjoy a bonus product compliments of
chapstick so I'm guessing you're getting
some sort of chapstick thing in here and
also um it says a beauty experience too
big for any box each winner will receive
so you can basically enter to win a box
worth seven hundred dollars so very very
cool but anyway this is what it looks
like you have a little tissue wrapping
and then you open it up and yeah I'm
just going to choose randomly and i will
read for you guys in the pamphlet um
basically what they talk about so the
first thing I seen here is a candle
which I'm like it
I love candles you just love yet okay
this is the ilume a are lumi a or aluna
I think let's see here I'm ilume
blackberry absinthe e Epis in the--
candle abs i nthe absentee I'm not quite
sure how to say that but this is a
scented paraffin and soy wax candle
those are supposed to be um basically
like healthier for you like it's okay if
you inhale them I don't know if that's
what I've heard it has notes of
blackberry and orange with a hint of
patchouli and sandalwood and it says why
we like it it's fruity notes may seem
like a shopping mall holiday bazaar
headache but this candles blackberry and
orange which are admittedly sweet are
balanced by sandalwood rose and
patchouli the result is a blend that's
festive and seasonal yet still
sophisticated this candle is so mega
scented it will fragrance a room even if
it isn't burning so if you do not like
strong fragrances you're probably not
going to like this I'm talking to you
leora my family or is very very
sensitive to sense so don't get this it
says if you like lots of aroma go for it
and I share do it says blow it out after
30 minutes to avoid overkill the bonus
is the full-size campbell comes in a
variety of pretty votives including our
favorite one picture here a gorgeous
mercury glass with an oxidized finish
that begs to be repurposed or yeah
repurposed for later so that is what the
full size looks like really really
pretty kind of mercury jar kind of thing
and obviously this is what the little
sample size looks like but the price of
the full-size candle is 23 dollars and
fifty cents so that's pretty normal for
a candle on that size it seems like
that's you know it's like Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works free with candles those are around
20 but this is what it looks like and
let's go ahead and take a whip it
doesn't seem overpowering at all I'm one
of those people that can really handle a
lot of fragrance so maybe it's just me
it smells good I like it you can
definitely smell the bergamot or like
the orange in there and the blackberry
so I am excited um to burn this the next
thing I see in here is from a vein or
oven
the oath and mal this is a brand that
it's in a lot of these alors on beauty
boxes and I really really like their
products every time I'm sorry if I'm
going like this I have a little bit of a
runny nose um but every time I get some
kind of product like this from the span
brand oven I really really end up liking
it I may have a lot of great facial
cleansers and just things like that so I
believe I have purchased two full sides
and a vein products that I've gotten in
Allure beauty boxes before one was the
facial spray and the other one was um a
mono Lauren acne wash basically it was
very very good so anyway this is a body
oil and it is for dry to very dry
sensitive skin so it looks like it's
going to be really really nice around
this time of the year you do get 50 ml
in here or 1.69 of fluid ounces and it
says um the full size the price is
twenty-six dollars and you do get 200
milliliters and you do get like a nice
little pump with a full size but what it
is is an oil for very dry sensitive skin
it softens and hydrates your body as it
helps alleviate that awful urge to
scratch extra dry areas so that sounds
very nice for the winter months the key
ingredients are mineral oil and avocado
oil not quite sure about that mineral
oil I've heard mineral oil is not
fantastic for your skin but avocado oil
is a very very moisturizing so I'm
excited it says it is thick almost um it
like pale yellow oil it has a sharp
grassy sent hmm wait a minute let's open
it up and smell it oh it does it's good
for what I wouldn't say grassy sent it
smells like a little bit spicy grassy
makes it sound really strange but it
smells a little spicy it's nice it says
if you spend every winter itchy dry
flaky and miserable which I kind of do a
combination skin that does get that way
during the winter you know the struggle
to find a product that keeps your skin
soft and hydrated and this one is no
watery skim it on lotion the oil is
thick even a palmful doesn't spread far
you'll keep dumping out more to cover
large areas give it a few minutes to
sink in before dressing but don't bother
waiting for it to fully disappear it
will still have a nice Sheen and a bit
of slick
to your skin hours later one tester
whose body skin is so dry that her
dermatologist told her to coat herself
with aqua for every morning found that
this prevented tightness itching and
flaking from the first use just be aware
that the grass ECG scent is unusual in a
world of vanilla cupcake frosting body
products if sweet fragrances are your
thing you may not love it I love sweet
fragrances but this is not offensive in
any way to me it doesn't smell grass
like to me just smells a little I'm
spicy so I do like it and I'm excited to
try it I do not love that kind of greasy
feeling on my body but i will try this
because i do like this brand a lot
alright the next thing I seen here is
from chlorine this is the extra dry dry
shampoo with oat milk it says gentle
formula for all hair types it cleanses
hair without water I've actually heard
really good things about this dry
shampoo so this is a nice little um
sample sort of size you get one fluid
ounce in here let's read about it let's
see here where is it there it is
chlorine a dry shampoo with oat milk the
full size is 150 milliliters and the
price is twenty dollars so that it's a
little expensive but I know you can get
the chlorine products on the safaricom
website so of course it's going to be a
little pricier what it is it's an
aerosol dry shampoo for all hair types
and colors it decreases dirty hair and
it has corn and rice starches and silica
that help absorb oil and dirt this white
mists smell a little grandma think
floral powder but the scent doesn't
stick around for long lately people love
to talk about how multi-purpose dry
shampoos are used them to texturize it
holds up dudes it puffs up fine here
even when it's clean forget all that
this spray just does the most essential
dry shampoo thing really really well it
gets oily slickness out of your roots
and fluffs up length mid-lengths fluffs
up link mid lengths and ends one editor
with thick long hair spritzes it all
over her scalp before bed on day four
dirty hair and rubs it in with a towel
in the morning a fine and oily hair an
editor who usually turns into a grease
ball by 2pm that sounds like me if she
skip
shampooing look like she had a fresh
blow out until bedtime after using this
this stuff also gets the thumbs up for
our dark-haired editors who you know
don't want any kind of dusty or grey
residue in the hair if you just spray it
on to your roots let it sit for two
minutes then brush really well so I am
excited to try that i have heard really
good things I think Samantha Sherman or
maybe it was glam life grew tati maybe
with both of them I heard a one or maybe
both of them talked about this product
and how they really liked it so I'm
excited for that alright the next thing
I see here is a pop beauty kajal pencil
and I this is an eyeliner and I believe
I just did a declutter series and I got
rid of the black one like this I just
didn't really like it so I probably
won't like this one it looks like it's
just in a kinky yeah it's an inky purple
so it's just like a purpley kind of
shade I'll try it again but it has a
smudger little sponge on one side and
then the pencil on the other is very
creamy it is a kajal pencil so it is
nice but yeah let's read about it it
says Pat Beauty kajal pen in inky purple
it is a dark grayish purple eyeliner
that's flattering on light and dark eyes
the tip is somewhat wide and while the
formula is malleable it's not
particularly soft I thought I remembered
it being soft well I don't even know if
I want to use it now I don't like I like
your set hard and soft you guys like I
hate when it's like oh it's like pulling
at your skin you know it says purple
kajal pronounced kajal or cuz you oh
really is that how we say it I thought
it was kajal kajal right cuz yield cuz
yield pencil guys the liner can go one
of two ways it's so vivid only the young
and dairy we wear it or subtle enough
for real life this is the latter first
of all the shade yes it's purple but it
has a slate gray purple the indigo tones
are just noticeable enough to make blue
eyes look more intense and brown eyes
look stronger and sexier and despite the
name kajal orca gio huh gajeel liners
aim to be the ultimate in soft smudge
enos the pencil is hard enough to create
a thin precise line in fact you need to
use a heavy hand to have that much
impact at all there's a smudger on one
end and we found the spongy surface was
basically an eraser a fingertip works
better to soften Imbler one small
warning the cap on each does not stay on
very well so
this product may be suited for your
vanity than your makeup bag thanks for
letting us know so the price for this is
ten dollars you can get it at pop beauty
calm again we have gotten one of these
before and I did go ahead and let it go
in my declutter series it was a black
one I don't remember just liking it I
don't remember what it was I thought
that it actually was too smudgy so I
guess it depends on how oily your
eyelids are on things like that alright
the next thing I see in here is from
chapstick like they said it was a little
sponsored card at the beginning this is
the tech stick total hydration I love
lip balm so I'm sure I'm going to love
this this is the soothing vanilla non
tinted one hundred percent natural with
arbonne oil it's intensely moisturizes
it replenishes the lips and i were to
scratch myself and has vitamin E it is
clinically proven to give you healthier
looking lips and yes soothing vanilla
scent that is what it looks like this is
a full-size let's read about it alrighty
where are you chapstick it's just just
it was that just like a little extra
product that they threw in there and
then I am going to talk about it ok so
that was literally just like an extra
little product it literally is sponsored
they don't have a little section on it
it was just one of those extra little
things you get that is sponsored so I am
excited to try it I love lip balms and
I'm sure it will work well alright the
next thing I see is the Smashbox photo
finish foundation primer this is the oil
free one this is um that really really
kind of silicone e feeling 1 i'm pretty
sure it is yeah the light one i have a
full size of the light one but this was
like the original one that came out i
feel like this was like the first primer
that got everybody in two climbers if
that makes sense it has like a clear
formula and it really really is like
highly kind of silicone e nowadays you
can get a lot of primers like this even
better like deals at the drugstore but
this is a nice little sample size and
you do get a point two five fluid ounces
in here let's read about what they have
to say about this product i already kind
of have opinions on it but that's okay
so that is what it looks like the full
size is thirty-six dollars and you can
get it on smashbox calm or sephora calm
it is a primer for base and concealer
that won't clog your pores when we say
it's thin the clear gel is weightless on
the skin
we mean it feels like absolutely nothing
for a second you wonder if it is somehow
vanished between your fingers and your
face I disagree with that because it's
one of those silicone II kind of primer
so I feel like you can feel I don't
think I don't know what they were
thinking but if you've ever tried it
before you know especially if you use um
any kind of silicone II primers you know
that that texture doesn't really go away
I don't want to know what they mean by
that but it says it has a slightly match
but not dried out looking finished I do
agree with that I think any kind of
silicone II primer does that to your
face like it makes you look a little
more matte but hopefully doesn't dry you
out why we like it talk to a makeup
junkie and you're likely to hear tales
of primers gone wrong once that's piled
up ones that suffocated the skin but
this smashbox primer is a past best of
beauty winner for a reason it's so light
that it feels more like a fine dusting
of powder if you have oily skin go ahead
and smooth it on instead of a
moisturizer a dryer types wait for your
cream to sink in and then sweep it on
top of any bad chemistry worries what's
it what does that mean I guess any areas
where you have pores like around your
nose your forehead your t-zone notes
that if your skin is really dry and dull
it may be a little too Matt 140
something editor thought it looked
chalky and added a few years onto her
skin I feel like that happens with any
sort of very very thick heavy kind of
silicone e primer if your skin is too
dry or um you know if you have very very
much her skin sometimes it can emphasize
things a little more but anyway I am
excited to have that little sample um
and the last thing in here is from skin
sensual this is the rest of retro oh my
gosh you guys everybody is getting into
respiratory on this huge little rants
and I talked about how my boyfriend is a
doctor he's been taking breast of our
all internally for years now and he
always talks about it he actually had a
teacher in med school that was like all
about rest for all he's done tons of
research it actually makes you look
younger over time and my boyfriend is 32
and he looks like he is 25 so I think it
does work especially if you take it
internally but recently totally has
released a whole rest for a trotline
both my boyfriend I really like the
night
cream I really like the night I balm and
also I really like the serum it makes
him break out but I really like the
serum so it's kind of cool to see that
everybody is getting into resveratrol
now so anyway this is an antioxidant
night concentrate to boost skins
resilience it helps radiate radiate it
helps with radiance it helps with
elasticity and also density of the skin
so let's see here I know the skin
sensual tends to be a more expensive
sort of line so this is basically the
sample size that you get which i think
is nice again I think this is more of a
yeah it's more of a kind of serum sort
of thing I'm guessing but I am excited
to try it out I think that it will be
good yeah it says resveratrol helps to
stay in healthy longevity by
neutralizing intracellular free radical
damage and repairing the visible effects
of age accelerated skin and yeah this
triple patent-pending formulation it
maximize concentration of pure staple
resveratrol baba wawa okay that sounds
very very medical I don't know how to
say those words but yeah it's supposed
to neutralize the age accelerating
internal free radicals it's strengthens
with the functionality to resist new
damage and promote skin's natural repair
to diminish the signs of accumulated
damage in the skin so wow that's sure
claims to do a lot let's read about it
in the booklet on the skin sensual is
resveratrol de what it does it is a
concentrated anti-aging gel so not
necessarily a um not necessarily a serum
I guess the price is 150 two dollars per
30 milliliters but you do get it with a
nice little pump and what not they have
put skin sensual consensual products in
their boxes before and I'm always very
very impressed that they are so so
brightly for the full size but anyway it
says it helps fight fine lines wrinkles
dullness with powerful antioxidants it's
got resveratrol niacin
my vitamin e and a bias la la vie Ocalan
mm-hmm yes I said that right which are
antioxidants and anti ages it says this
yellow tinge faintly antiseptics
smelling gel feels like an ointment at
first but melts into the skin as you rub
it in it goes on cool and wept and
absorbs in seconds why we liked it to
the gel is packed with a one percent
concentration which is the highest level
of antioxidant resveratrol which apps
ups the skin's ability to defend itself
from damage while repairing existing
trouble on the skin in the company's own
three months studies which included
measuring skin density by ultrasound
that gel significantly improve the
radiance and firmness of the testers
skin around the office we also noticed
impressive results our testers skin
looked brighter and smoother after just
a week of nightly used so again very
very pricey but I will let you guys know
what I think of that and if I like it
more than the code early resveratrol
line um but yeah that is it that was
what it was in my little Elora sample
society box for this month I'm going to
be continuing to do these unboxings I
just kind of I don't know I fell out of
it for a while I feel like I was opening
up the boxes like right when they got
here and I was just getting excited and
open opening down before you know
turning on the camera and doing it with
you guys basically but I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you my next one
