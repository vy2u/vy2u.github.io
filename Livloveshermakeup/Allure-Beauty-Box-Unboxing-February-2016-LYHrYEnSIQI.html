guys would like to see what is in this
month's box then please keep watching
alright so I have not peaked which is
good i normally peak because i can't
help myself but this is what it looks
like when you open it up you can see the
little pamphlet which i will of course
read through with you guys then we have
the tissue wrapping and oh girl look at
all the products in this month's box oh
my gosh i'm excited i've seen like
lancome kevin murphy bvlgari like a girl
okay let's go ahead and read a little
bit about i guess i'll just start at the
beginning of the pamphlet so let's see
here the first thing that is in here is
sent so we have the bvlgari omnia para
la ba reeba Oh buddy yes Italian okay
what it is a floral citrus fragrance of
passion fruit orange bitter sweet orange
scent passion flower gardenia cocoa
beans and a vet to VA whatever that is
it says bright and sunny this is the
kind of fragrance that puts a smile on
your face it's a delicate citrus floral
that works year-round since it goes with
sundresses and perks up dreary weather
days just remember to see em to your
stand your new sample straight up on a
table when you open it it's a dabber not
a spritz oh you don't want it to spill
and the price for two point two ounces
is 82 dollars and you can get it at the
support on website so this is what it
looks like look at that adorable little
packaging cute little gold box and it
said to pull straight upwards oh my god
this is such cute packaging you guys
know I have like a little tray if you've
seen my perfume collection video I'm a
little separate tray where I put like
little mini perfumes like this so I'm
gonna put that up there cuz I think this
is an adorable bottle but it says to
pull not twist okay yeah so it opens up
like that kind of interesting so you
actually just pull straight up oh it
really does smell good yes it makes me
happy it says that it will make me happy
and put a smile on my face and it really
does smell like that definitely very
very floral E and sweet at the same time
so yeah that is super super super cute
alright moving on the second thing that
they
in here let's turn the page they have
Mouse and they have the hello breath
spray which is an alcohol-free breath
freshener it gets rid of copy breath and
the main ingredient isn't xylitol and it
says this breath spray comes in three
min tea flavors sweet mojito mint tart
pink grapefruit mint and the more
traditional super mint it's small enough
to do two things it fits in your clutch
and it does not scream my breath stinks
when you use it it's a lot taste french
onion soup delicious garlic parmesan
fries this is the rare breath freshener
that actually covers all sorts of smells
it is the hygienic bonus is that the
bottle clicks shut so it doesn't get
grimy inside of your purse or bag and a
size for this little mini one is three
dollars and seventy nine cents and you
can get it at target com so I have tried
the hello um fresh or the hello brand
before and I'm really really happy
because it looks like I got these super
mint flavor I have tried the what was it
mouthwash in the pink grapefruit or like
the mint grapefruit or whatever it is
that flavor and it was really really
gross I didn't like it but I did like
the mojito mint want like the mouthwash
I like it because it's all-natural and a
half like it's violet all in it which is
supposed to help with like dry mouth and
things like that so yeah it seems like a
good product and so I'm happy I got the
super mint one because I don't want that
pink grapefruit set so let's go ahead or
that taste let's go ahead and book in
the shop because I want to use it I want
to demo it on camera are you guys
alright let's see oh my god look how
little it is cute all right what oh it's
a very very minty but super super good
it is not tested on animals and it
freshens it's delicious it improves your
dates and it is free of alcohol dies and
ouch meaning it's not like um spicy it
is a little spicy but it doesn't burn I
guess that's what they mean by free
alcohol alright cool I'm excited for
that it is adorable and it actually
really tastes good I feel very fresh
right now alright the next thing I see
is the lips and hands so for lips we
have the pur Lisse daily lip nourisher
and it is a lip balm without parabens or
petroleum it soothes chapped lips in 02
seconds
they have mango seed butter shea butter
hobo oil rice bran oil and vitamin e in
it it reminds of you said below that it
says it reminds of Rama why are so too
many videos today it says it reminds us
it reminds us of an ointment it is thick
clear and it doesn't smell like anything
it says used after skiing flying or
testing 20 lipsticks this stuff softens
and um you know coddled are dry and
painfully chapped lips right on the spot
it's the kind of formula that
dermatologists love it's been enough to
fill in cracks thick enough to seal in
moisture and fragrance free as much as
we heart the scent and tinted bulbs they
can be irritating when your lips are
very chapped and are especially bad so
the price for the little tiny size that
this is actually sixteen dollars and you
can get a SE pur Lisse calm website so
this is what it looks like very cute
let's open it up and see what it's like
I literally just found a video on my top
5 lip balms so we'll see like I said it
has mango and shea butter in it I like
that it's in a little squeezy tube let's
see what the texture looks like I'm a
big texter snob and send snob so that is
what the texture looks like feels really
really nice it feels almost like
petroleum jelly a little more oily but I
know it is free of petroleum which is
good if you are somebody who's sensitive
to petroleum it doesn't smell very good
it just smells like a normal lip balm
but we'll see how it goes and i like
that it is in a little squeezy too
alright cool we'll be on two hands we
have the skin fixed ultra-rich pen cream
it is a hand cream with zero parabens
fatal 8 or fragrance and it treats
painfully dry and cracked hands and I've
coconut oil and sunflower oil aloe race
brand extract and vitamin E which is an
antioxidant for your hands it says this
stuff is called ultra rich for good
reason it's thick as icing and for
people who adore sweets just as
comforting and the fact that it's
fragrance free means it doesn't sting
any sort of cuts that you might have on
your hands I have a little area right
here on my wrist right now where it's
gotten so dry that is starting to split
open and you know it hurts when you put
like fragrance products right there it
just stays so this will be nice they'll
try it tonight it says this stuff is
called ultra rich or I already read that
part it makes good on the promise of
soothing seriously dry cracked
for one editor who had eczema on her
wrist on a normal skin it relieves
dryness caused by running around in the
cold and the full size of it is 999 and
you can get it at Target so this is what
it looks like most put some on ya got a
demo everything what can I say I'll not
see here this little thing off let's try
it out okay so it looks like it's a nice
thick white cream yes it is completely
scent-free feels nice not too oily on
the hands i like that i don't like super
super oily hand cream so hopefully this
one will be good alright moving on in
the pamphlet we have kevin murphy and
i'm really excited for this because
kevin murphy is actually the hair brand
that they sell at my salon so I'm pretty
excited this is the Kevin Murphy hydrate
me wash and rinse it is a sulfate-free
shampoo and conditioner that cleanses
and conditions gently enough to use on
any hair type and has shea butter an
evening primrose oil in it and it has
Kokua de Kokua Kokua de plum which is an
antioxidant it says this scent is sweet
and a little tart like lemon cake mmm
and it says the shampoo leathers mildly
and the conditioner is thicker and
creamier than most so it makes hair
extra soft we put the duo to the test on
different hair types and it was a
unanimous hit I made curls look bouncy
dry hair look smooth and frequently
bleached hair like mine look healthy
there is one drawback it takes a little
extra work to spread the conditioner
over curls since it is a thicker formula
than others still our tester thought it
was worth it for how lush and springy
made her hair look afterward so for full
size it is twenty seven dollars and
fifty cents each and you can get them at
Kevin Murphy calm or at certains too
long locations like my salon alright
let's go ahead and see what they look
like I wonder if this to this smells
like lemon cake it probably smells like
oh my god I got all over yeah it smells
like all of the kevin murphy products
which are kind of like a perfumey lemony
scent i would say so this is the hydrate
v wash so this is what it looks like I
love the kevin murphy packaging they all
look like this even in the full-size
really cute little square bottles and
then the hydrate me rinse which smells
the same yep smell it absolutely the
same and yeah i would say it does smell
kind of like lemon cake all of the kevin
murphy products smell very sim
and it small really good all right
moving on at the last thing that we have
in the box is from long coat and it is
the Lancome Visionnaire nuit beauty
sleep Perfector advanced multi corrected
kurama multi correcting gel-in-oil it is
an overnight facial moisturizer it makes
skin gigi hadid glowy who's Gigi Hadid
she's a model right like victoria secret
model i think i've seen her before she's
beautiful again this has soy bean
extract algae extract glycerin and
ceramides which help moisturize the skin
and adds a no signing you add a so 90 so
nice which buys inflammation I don't
know if I said that right it probably
didn't all right it is a gel-in-oil that
sounds confusing but let's clear that up
for you quickly this moisturizer feels
like a gel coming out of the pot and
melts in as an oil as you rub it into
the skin a neat trick that makes it
extra soothing but it won't clog oily
skin or grease up here or pillow while
you're sleeping at the smell is that
comforting floral moisturizer sent you
know the one that we're talking about it
said it balanced Skin Editor skin after
plane rides and made us look more
glowing that we probably deserved after
long nights of freaking and it's tooth
pain over it soon hangovers as well on a
regular night in mixed skin is radiant
sa supermodels and a price for a full
sizes eighty eight dollars and you can
get this on the Lancome dash usa.com
website all right so let's see this is
what the packaging looks like the outer
packaging let's open it is all right
very very tiny will see on both but
that's okay this is what it looks like
and I would like to test a little bit on
the back of my hand since that is what
I'm doing in this video see here all
right yeah interesting it is like a gel
can you guys see that and then as you
rub it in oh very lightweight it does
turn into an oil oh it smells really
good yeah it does smell like that
typical kind of lancome perfume me and
like floral scent if you have sensitive
skins may not be a good one for you but
it smells really really good alright so
those are all the products for this
month in my allure beauty box I feel
like these physicals are really really
good box sometimes I feel like it's a
hit and miss with the allure beauty
