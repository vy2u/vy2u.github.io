please excuse the big puffy scarf it is
this morning it was negative 3 yeah I
was up very early was negative three
degrees this morning and right now it's
like seven degrees it's very cold here
so I'm a big fluffy scarf on by the way
people were asking me where I bought
this skirt my mom actually picked this
up for me at TJ maxx um and the reason I
like it is because I had a cat and she
actually passed away in September but I
used to toss her over my left shoulder
and kind of have her just like on my
shoulder and she was always very furry
and she just kind of hang there it was
very very cute and so my mom got this
for me as one of my christmas gifts
because it kind of feels soft it's like
fur faux fur of course on one side and
then it's like textured on the other but
anyway I wanted to tell you guys that
cuz I thought that was kind of a cute
story but she was like the love of my
life and she used to just sit on my
shoulder and this kind of feels like her
so I like having it wrapped around my
neck but anyway please excuse the big
bulky scarf it is very cold but I am
here to do an unboxing for you guys on
the allure beauty box for the month of
January um so let's just get right into
it this is what the box looks like and
we shall open it up I haven't even
peeked I'm very proud of myself we have
the little pamphlet I will course read
for you guys what it says in here about
all of the different products and this
is what the little box looks like we
have some tissue paper and we open it up
and here are the goodies for the month i
will link below where you guys can pick
up the lower beauty box if you're
interested look at all the prices and
everything it's not an affiliate link so
feel free to click it um let's see here
the first thing I see is the deep
cleansing oil from DHC this is a facial
cleanser it looks like this so really
really nice little kind of deluxe sample
size let's read about this product it
says the DHC deep cleansing oil what it
is it is a gentle oil-based facial
cleanser for normal to dry skin what it
does when massage in this water soluble
formula binds to dirt and dissolves
makeup even waterproof mascara without
stripping skin or leaving the
a greasy Shane the fragrance free
cleanser is satisfyingly slippery and
transforms into a cloudy white fluid as
you rinse your face the key ingredients
are olive oil which which helps
moisturize and cleanse the skin and it
says rubbing a handful of oil all over
your face sounds like the ideal way to
get a gigantic breakout but this
oil-based cleanser could it be more
different than the kind of oil you put
on your salad this lightweight get
hydrating formula emulsifies in water to
deep clean skin and unlike any other oil
cleanser that can leave behind traces of
residue this one rinses off completely
just make sure your hands are totally
dry before massaging on a quarter size
drop the cleanser needs to be in its oil
form tough on to the jump the junk on
your skin and wash it away the price is
twenty eight dollars for 6.7 ounces so
I'm really excited to try this you guys
know one of my favorite ways to remove
my makeup is with my bosha makeup break
up cool cleansing oil I love oil
cleansing so you can either use this to
remove your face makeup or your eye
makeup everything or if you have dry
skin you can actually use this as knee
cleanser so I'm excited to try that the
next thing I see in here is from skin
cosmetics this is dmitri james caviar
lip cream in the shade Ruby it's a
beautiful kind of mavi red color I'm
going to go ahead and swatch it for you
guys it looks like it's a lip cream so
really nice kind of matte formula oh my
god beautiful this is beautiful check
that out very very pretty it's gonna be
a little bit of like a pink undertone in
it it's not completely red alright let's
read about this odd the skin cosmetics
caviar lip cream in Ruby it is a liquid
lipstick in a candy apple red shade but
I really do see a bit of a pink
undertone I don't know if it's going to
show up that way on camera but there is
definitely like a little bit of like a
fuchsia undertone in here very pretty um
it says the firm ankle tip applicator
delivers a precious swipe up precious
white a precise swipe of this lipstick
lipstick gloss hybrid the formula is
creamy not sticky so feels more like a
lightweight lip oil than a heavy gloss
it even glided over 1 testers chapped
lips without catching on her flakes and
her lips were noticeably more hydrated
after the color wore off a few hours
later it tends to disappear from the
middle of your lips first leaving a ring
of color around your mouth I hate that
but that always happens with like lip
stains or lip creams um it says so
you'll have to reapply often to keep an
even finish on the lips so a full size
is $22 and that actually looks like it
is a full size which is kind of small
but I'm excited to wear this a very
pretty color like I said the shade is
called Ruby but it definitely has a kind
of pinky fuchsia undertone to it so I'm
excited to try that out alright the next
product I see in here is from derma e
this is the hydrating night creme it is
cruelty free paraben free a hundred
percent vegan and natural and that is
the size that you get which is quite
nice um let's see 14 grams and let's
worried about this one it says the derma
e hydrating night cream is a rich face
cream that intensely moisturizes without
making skin feel smothered this cream
has the consistency of a lotion and a
faint scent a fresh apricot who I have
to smell it I love apricot oh yeah I
smell it if there is its way in there
but it's in there oh nice I like that I
love the scent of apricot you guys love
it um the key ingredients are glycerin
hyaluronic acid is a helluva hyaluronic
acid vitamins A and E panthenol and a
low which help moisturize vitamin C
which is antioxidant and it said it said
not all heroes wear capes this all-star
formula is filled with super
moisturizers that sink right into
parched skin and provide excellent
plumping one acne-prone tester was also
pleasantly surprised to find that her
skin looked less red and irritated after
just a few days of use and big sigh of
relief she had no new break up afterward
on and 42 ounces it is twenty-nine
dollars and fifty cents and you can get
that on the derma e com website so I'm
excited to try this I love skincare so
the fools right up my alley alright the
next thing I see it's from smiths this
is a natural deodorant it says lavender
plus stage and it's like a
it says soften a small dab between
fingers and apply gently to skin do not
over apply it is cruelty free vegan and
all-natural this is weird wow it smells
really good but look that's kind of
strange right so it's like a cream
deodorant you take a little bit it's
weird it's not like creamy and all its
kind of dry you rub it between your
fingers he's got like texture in it
strange and then you rub it underneath
your armpits get a wipe um I don't know
about that it's weird it feels like it's
like grainy like there's pieces of sand
in there which is strange but I guess
it's good I know that all natural
deodorants are much better for your help
and do not like the fact that all of the
deodorants i use personally I really
just don't like having like white
underarms so I need to use a gel one or
a spray and I don't like the fact that
they all have aluminum in them I know
that that's not good for your house but
it's it is what it is alright so let's
read a little bit about this i'm very
curious schmitz natural deodorant in
lavender and stage it does smell good
though an all-natural vegan and
cruelty-free deodorant it fights
underarm odor it had baking soda
arrowroot powder shake Shay and Coco see
butters so that helps neutralize odor
moisturize and absorbs wetness um it
says the white powder cream melts down
to a gritty sell between your fingers
for application and it's clean just
fresh just rolled around and lavender
field scent lasts until you wash off the
deodorant your hippie dippie friend may
have tried to turn you on to our pit
rocks but we are not your hippie dippie
friend this natural deodorant is for
people who don't like natural deodorant
because it actually works and even
though it's not technically an
antiperspirant it keeps arms fairly dry
thanks to its arrowroot powder base but
the stuff isn't perfect one tester
describes scooping a pea-sized dollop
out of the pot as being like digging
into a candle it's true it's a very very
that's like waxy it's hard um and
another just couldn't get used to the
feeling of spreading a cream on her pits
with her fingers but if you're
interested in switching to a natural
deodorant this is the warm two tries
this is 899 42 ounces and I don't know
how much is in here this is point 5
ounces so not at full size all right i'm
not going to sure about that but i will
try it out like i said i do want to
eventually wow look I got that lip cream
everywhere I do want to eventually
switch over to a natural deodorant
because I know they are better for your
health aluminum is not good for you and
I know the stuff that comes in the spray
which is one of my favorite deodorants
like the Dove dry spray that's not good
to inhale so I mean I figure I already
inhale enough face powder isn't it but I
know that that's not good for your house
so I'm going to try I will try the
deodorant I'll let you guys know the
next thing I see in here is from the
manly beauty this is the other color
straight waterproof liner it's got a
little brush on one end and then you get
the color on the other and this shade is
called black maybe that's what it looks
like let's go ahead and watch it that's
a pretty color it's just like am at Nazy
black exactly what it says there it is a
little bit you know bluish undertone in
there very nice um it says it is a deep
blue waterproof gel eyeliner with a
built-in brush the buttery liner glides
on without tugging and the tapered brush
makes blending it please the dark navy
Hugh is also the perfect shade of weight
is that black oh no cool it's blue
ignore what your mother told you about
wearing black with navy this smoky blue
liner is bold edgy and easy on the eyes
literally whereas some waterproof
eyeliner stick to your lids like
industrial strength super glue this
formula stays out pliable for a good 30
seconds giving you just enough time to
smudge it out and it's waterproof claims
are pretty solid its day put on a spin
loving tester through class and three
full 12 hours afterwards so that is the
full size and it is twenty dollars and
you can get that on QVC alright the next
thing I see I think yes Livni this is a
this easy Epis RP yeah I'm gonna do that
every time this week a little French it
just going to French accent you know yes
um this is the trust fund beauty
you I'm guessing this is a nail polish
this is the little box it comes in very
very pretty let's open it up and see
what color I got i know sometimes they
said not different colors to different
people Wow beautiful look at that is a
big big thing of nail polish right there
it's a beautiful kind of opalescent gold
color with tons of shimmer let's read
about it this is the trust fund beauty
nail polish in champagne problems
champagne problems hashtag champagne
problems it is a glittery metallic gold
nail polish that's 5 free what's that
mean oh the 5 free formula is free of
tulane formaldehyde lead nickel and feta
lights why we like it too most sparkly
polishes deposit approximately 2 flex of
glitter with each swipe but this thick
creamy formula coats nails with an
opaque smattering of golden glitz and
the rich hue you see in the bottle ends
up dried to a soft muted luster some
nails look less studio 54 and more
candlelit cocktail hour what a coat will
cover nails but our testers found the
two coats fared better in a week long
chip tests and the price for this
full-size 17ml is fifteen dollars very
very cool and you can buy that from
trust fund beauty com alright and then
the last thing in the box with that
little black sample right there and that
is the ER no loss low in New York
transfuse I refiner a that is what it
looks like very small little size
definitely example it is an eye cream
that plumps up dry ba skin you literally
says dry blasket what it does it
decreases the appearance of fine lines
and wrinkles around the eyes as it
moisturizes like crazy the key
ingredients are a water binding agent
that plumped and tighten skin um
something else that i can't pronounce
that helps preserve and boost collagen
production algae extract Lucerne shea
butter olive oil and avocado oil which
moisturize vitamin E cranberry seed oil
and rosemary extract which are
antioxidants and peptides which help
reduce wrinkles how it looks and feels
and smells this white cream serum hybrid
absorbs in a snap and has no discernible
sent I'm very excited to try this
like I creams that sink in immediately
why we like it thanks to its mix of
metrics all three thousand which is a
Back to the Future sounding synthetic
peptide then how strengthen aging
thinning hair or hair aging thinning
skin it says light plumping humectants
this formula delivers both immediate
effects for the impatient and long-term
results for they skeptical I feel like I
one of those people where honestly I
never know if an eye cream really does
what it should do I've never found an
eye cream that was like the most holy
grail thing ever I think the only thing
yeah the only i couldnt that I've ever
found that actually does what it says is
that yes to grapefruit one it's an it's
supposed to help conceal under eye
darkness and that's the only eye cream
ever found that does what it says it's
going to do or clean you know and most
of them thats a lie people get rid of
wrinkles or plump them up that's all I
feel about this plump them up and never
really gets rid of wrinkles so I always
am one of those people that skeptical
I'm like why shouldn't I just use my
moisturizer underneath my eyes but I
have so many eye creams they need to get
through but I'm sure after i'm done with
them the only one that i would probably
repurchase is the yester grapefruit one
sorry went on low around there um but it
says this helps moisturize so that you
don't notice crim penis around your eyes
it's lightweight enough to be used under
makeup at night make sure to apply
before any heavier cream so that all
anti-aging goodness can penetrate your
skin and a full side is point five
ounces and 105 dollars no wonder it's
such a small sample because this is an
expensive product alright guys that is
my a lower beauty box for the month of
GNE race i hope you guys enjoyed this
unboxing thank you so much for joining
me and i'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
