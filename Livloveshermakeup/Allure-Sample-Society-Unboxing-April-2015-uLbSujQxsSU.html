thought today I would do an unboxing
video for you guys this unboxing is
going to be on the allure sample society
box for the month of April so let's just
dig in I have not even opened this yet
and yeah so the first thing I see is the
little pamphlet they send every single
month it just shows what products are in
there and they talk about why they like
it so I'll read out of that for you guys
and then we have a little bit of tissue
paper pull it back and that's what we
have in the boxes man so let's start
with I guess the first thing that pops
up in the book it is the JaneDear at all
just kissed lip plumper in Rio and its
really really tiny little size but super
cute it looks like that and like I said
the color is Rio it's a very neutral
kind of your lips but better start of
color we can swatch that on my hand it's
almost like a little more on the brown
side it's very pretty and it seems to be
going on quite well so that is the color
and let me read for you guys what it
says about this product it says the je r
at all just kissed lip plumper in Rio
what it is a sheer brown lipstick how it
looks / feels it could be the name of
the luminous brown sheen but this stuff
makes us think of Brazilian super
goddess adriana lima um it feels as soft
as a bomb why we like it if you are
looking to truly and slit your lips this
isn't going to do it and this precisely
why we are drawn to it turns out by an
earlier generation of lip plumpers that
burns like hell and left our lips itchy
and dry we assumed we were done with the
category for good but this formula is
light on the tingle and heavy on the
hydration the brownish tint is
especially fat flattering on dark skin
and the price is twenty-five dollars
very full size there's the description
of the product again there's the swatch
and there it is it's really been a teen
actually um the next thing in here turn
the page her skin is the benefit
Porefessional so let's get that out it
looks likely get a nice little size
she'll be perfect for traveling and you
open it up and
and have something like that oh it's so
cute which I'll definitely take this for
traveling because the full-size one I
don't use that much I just use it
usually in my t-zone so um this is the
product that you get and it says the
Porefessional is a makeup primer it's
velvety smooth and I have a famed peachy
sent it says why we like it as we said a
bazillion times you can't shrink your
pores but you can make them less
noticeable and they still live on based
primer is the fastest way to do that the
biggest difference between this bomb and
every other primary charters that you
can wear it under or over makeup if you
apply your first massage your raisin
size blog into your skin the light peach
trip made our skin look so glowy that we
decide to skip the base entirely if you
apply it after foundation tap it on
anywhere you tend to get oily and dad
with a makeup sponge until it disappears
one thing to remember this is a
temporary cover up you really want to
make pores less visible you need to
unplug them and for that we suggest a
salicylic acid cleanser so the full size
is thirty dollars i do have the full
size of this but this is great for
traveling such a nice little site the
next thing in here is sent and we have
the marc jacobs daisy dream perfume
right there and let's get it out here it
is it's just a little sample that bottle
is so cute and it says the marc jacobs
daisy dream what it is an aries floral
fragrance of the notes are blackberry
grapefruit pair jasmine lychee blue
wisteria white woods musk and coconut
water that sounds amazing why we like it
if you've ever skipped through a field
of wildflowers in white any white eyelet
dress you know exactly what wearing the
scent feels like it's a um but just like
a day during the scent is fleeting so
we'll have to reapply a couple of times
to keep that right happy vibe the price
for 1.7 ounces of seventy six dollars so
that's pretty pricey but let's try a
little out consultant sounds very very
appealing oh yeah that's really
beautiful really really beautiful for
spring or summer I've a very floral e
very nice I can smell the lychee in
there
okay moving on next thing is the Illuma
you yeah the ilume Tonkin wark handle
only love when boxes put candles and I
love candles so it says what it is a
scented paraffin and soy wax candle the
notes are Mandarin plum rose Jasmine
tonka bean musk sandalwood and
Madagascar vanilla why we like it the
scent is a warm sensual floral a little
jasmine and rose mostly earthy woods
this if they can't believe your light on
those al green black negligee nights but
the jar it comes in is the real star
painted a smoky-silver hombre that's
modern and edgy edgy and still goes
great with Al's love and happiness the
price is twenty dollars so let's see
here it is oh yeah it smells very very
nice I'm gonna burn that tonight I think
I got it almost look like mine have been
burned but it's just the wick I was like
oh then burn my shadow really nice then
it's very very light but very very nice
the candle and yeah let's see here
moving on for hair we have the bumble
and bumble hairdressers invisible oil
let's see you get that out so you get a
nice little kind of sample size like
that and for an oil that will probably
go quite a long way because oil else you
don't need too much of your hair so it
says Bumble and Bumble hair dressers and
visible oil what it is an oil for all
hair types what it does it enhances
shine prevents furs and smooth flyways
it says the key ingredients are our
canned coconut macadamia nut sweet
almond and grapeseed oils and how it
looks feels and smells the clear oil
feels slick at first but then it's so
extend leaving hair soft non-greasy it
smells high-end and exotic like a cross
between coconuts and gardenias and comes
in a pump bottle that discussed that
dispenses one piece eyes drop at a time
why we like it there are a few here so
there's that Beyonce stylist reese
witherspoon stylist and Jessica Alba
stylist all recommend and this happens
to be one of them it's the rare Harrell
that works on baby fine and thick coarse
hair like you can use it when your hair
is wet or dry our testers found that one
pump is enough for fine hair but you
need it lists at least six to eight for
thick long hair
which can make the smallish bottle
pricey for everyday use the full size is
thirty-nine dollars I have very very
fine here so hopefully I'll only need a
tiny little amount and that sample will
last quite a while and last thing you
get this month in the allure sample
society box is the is for body and it is
the mass cipolla lavender chamomile body
lotion if there's what it is is a
scented body lotion it moisturizes the
skin and it has lavender and chamomile
essential oils to moisturize how it
looks feels and smells the white lotion
feels rich but not heavy and smells like
a bundle of dried lavender the packaging
has a European apakah theory look a
welcome change from all the clinical
clinical white baubles crabbing our
medical cabinet why we like it this
lotion is super gentle and once it soaks
in there is no residue the formula is
light though and may not be hardcore
enough if your skin is seriously drive
hmm these sent on the other hand is no
joke it's strong and it sticks around if
you wear perfume try citrus one with
this lotion if you decide to slather it
on before bed excuse me you might pass
out before getting through a paragraph
of your book because it's lavender which
is very soothing um and if you don't
like the scent of lavender well this
probably isn't for you the full price is
twenty-four dollars for 7.5 fluid ounces
and I think we get a nice cute little
sample of this I mean it's pretty good
so that but with that is what was in my
allure sample society box for the month
of April um I'm happy I've only been
