today i am doing a unboxing of the
allure sample society box this is my
first one i purchased mine from
beautybar.com and the reason i got this
was because i saw mama loves mascara
here on youtube who is like my favorite
youtuber right now i will leave her link
below for her channel but i saw her
doing a few unboxing of this and it just
looked like you got really nice deluxe
ice samples of really good products so i
thought i'd try it so this is what the
box looks like i'm just gonna open it up
cute little red box the first thing i
see is this little pamphlet it says a
lure and it has all of the products that
are in the box in here and i will read
those as i go through so that is what
the box looks like the first thing I see
is from philosophy this is the renewed
hope in a jar refreshing and refining
moisturizer um it looks like it's a nice
little deal of size sample like that
definitely excited to try that out I
love the brand philosophy and it says
philosophy renewed hope in a jar what it
is an anti-aging facial moisturizer for
all skin types it says what it does it
hydrates and smooth skins with
exfoliating acids and it says the key
ingredients are hyaluronic acid which
helps to moisturize glycolic citric and
mandelic acids to help exfoliate so um
this cream has a slight sheen that makes
it look like vanilla frosting in the jar
but that's where the similarities end
the formula is lightweight cooling it
smells clean our only gripe is that it
takes a little longer than usual to rub
in we'll admit it we're lazy and it says
why we like it totally glowing skin we
put this stuff on and about half an hour
later looks like we just come from a
facial all radiant it's because the
cream contains the same acids that are
in a lot of the best peels only in lower
concentrations that means you don't have
to wait for an actual appeal to do its
thing and there's zero staining plus the
glycolic acid in the formula is really
good at making fine lines and sunspots
less noticeable in about two months the
only Cabot's it's not the most hydrating
moisturizer out there
doesn't contain sunscreen so we've been
using it before nights out and under our
SPF 50 in the a.m the price up for our
full size is forty seven dollars for two
ounces so that sounds like a very good
little moisturizer I'm excited the next
thing I see is the Phillip be
lightweight deep conditioning creme
rinse it says this is the classic
formula it increases hair's elasticity
and strength and has African shea butter
wheat germ and soy proteins in it looks
like that and it says the directions
massage through wet hair let it sit for
1 to 3 minutes and rinse well so let's
see what they wrote about this it says
it is a conditioner that anyone
including those of us with fine and our
color treated hair can use it says it
makes hair crazy shiny and easy to
detangle which is a big plus if your
hair is thick or long key ingredients
are shea butter and a boatload of oils
including hobo sesame walnut sweet
almond lavender greynium and olive how
it feels and smells it's lighter than
most conditioners and smells a little
like cinnamon by the time your hair is
dry the scent disappears completely why
we like it to read the long list of oils
and you'll think this conditioner would
leave your hair greasy like Brad Pitt
level but the blend of something a lot
of conditioner does can't it makes dry
hair look shiny and healthy just after
one use without weighing down and we've
got one oil to think that for ho ho but
oil creates the prettiest healthiest
looking machine says cosmetic chemists
at Nikita Wilson it penetrates hair to
keep it from breaking and it contains
the same conditioning lipids as your
scalps natural oils but there are two
things you should know before using this
conditioner it won't make split ends
less notable noticeable and it doesn't
make your hair feel as soft as of their
conditioners week time you'll want to
use styling cream afterwards for that
the price for a full size is twenty-six
dollars and it is six ounces for the
full size so definitely excite to use
that I always love using a nice deep
conditioner the next thing I see is the
Revlon Photoready I arts lid + line + /
and I think I picked one of these up the
other day but it was a little deeper in
color I believe so the concept is that
this is a cream shadow and then you get
um like liner there so very very pretty
color see what it says in here it says
Revlon Photoready I
r2 lid + Lionel / in gold glitz prism
peach prism and cobalt crystal so I'm
pretty sure I got two peach prism which
I love it's beautiful and it says two
color coordinated eyeshadows one cream
one glitter in a spill-proof wand they
make experimenting with colorful and
glittery eye makeup look ace I makeup
looks a cinch since the shades are all
going sheer and come with brushes that
are super precise how they look / feel
one coat of the creamer glitter creates
a pretty wash of color while two gives
you bold Sparkle we love that these
shades are refined the flecks of glitter
are small and the cream has a smooth
metallic finish that only becomes opaque
at three coats why we like that we want
our colorful makeup to be fun to wear a
no-brainer to apply and above all
flattering these shadows nail all those
and one of our favorite winter trends
makeup artists that have sprinkling
glitter on top of i shadow and makeup
it's like like it's pixie dust lately
and mascara like it's pixie dust lately
sorry guys um consider the faded blue in
coal buck crystal if you draw a graphic
graphic cat eye with the gray blue cream
on top in the black and blue glitter you
get an easy chic look the rose gold
shades is peach prism that's what I have
are particularly sexy on olive skin use
the cream as bolt liner and the glitter
as a highlight in the inner corners and
add lots of black mascara and then
there's cool glitz um we like pressing a
hint of black guitar all over the tops
of our mess tips of mascara lashes huh
or painting it along their roots like
liquid liner from rock and roll affect
price is 899 each so again mine is the
peach one very very pretty and next we
get this tiny little bar soap it says
seem a deep cleansing bar so so cute
look up tiny that is adorable this says
the ER no less LOC mud a deep cleansing
bar what it is a charcoal and mud facial
bar soap with a long time called flower
following it's great for all skin types
but those prone to oiliness and
breakouts are its most vocal fans what
it does it makes you feel completely
clean without
I knew out and there's no easy balancing
and that's no easy balancing act and
that's completely true I'm key
ingredients dead SEMA and charcoal
powder it's easily one of the coolest
looking bar soaps in the world because
of its charcoal color it smells exactly
like you want it to smell clean clean
clean and it lathers into a creamy gray
foam that is easy to rinse off why we
like it this own came out 75 years ago
and has been favorite of Jacqueline
Kennedy Greta Garbo Madonna and uma
Thurman the dead sea mud and charcoal
powder pull oil and dirt out of pores
like a magnet our editors with oily
complexions like to wait a few minutes
before rinsing it off so the soap can
act more like a mask the results skin
that softer smoother clearer and more
radiant after each use for a full size
it's $45 and you get five point three
ounces so definitely excited to try that
out the next thing in here is the soya
um nail polish in this gorgeous gorgeous
like mint color love that and it says
ZOA lacquers in Eden Leslie Tiana
Lillian and rain Raina and I have it in
Tiana so that is that my seafoam mint
tea color it says they are pastel nail
polishes that ad uh oh that are free of
tulane from behind camphor and DBP don't
know what any of those are except for
formaldehyde um it says why we like them
we don't typically beat the winter blues
with pastels but we fell hard for these
basically there's nothing prissy or
wishy-washy about them they're milky
minty tianna which is the one I have is
a dead ringer for pistachio gelato it's
still quirky and so cool there are two
baby blues that are striking against
dark skin Leslie is perfect lavender
with just the tiniest bit of blue-green
shimmer and Eden happens to be the same
shade of bubblegum pink we found the
chanel spring 2015 runway how's that for
being ahead of the trend just be sure to
use a base coat with all five shades to
avoid any streaks and they add nine
dollars each alright and the last thing
in here is from scribd becton which is
awesome because it's a very high-end
skincare brand this is the intensive
illuminating serum it says it boosts
skin clarity for a brighter more even
complexion and yeah so let's open that
up see the size kids if you can comes up
a little pump and everything oops you
guys see that kids get cute so let's
find us in the little booklets um where
are you straight okay where are you
Street activist not in here I swear to
you um what it doesn't look like this
directive one is in here I don't know
what that means I guess they didn't
write about it but um that is the
stirrer becton intensive illuminating
serum I'm super excited to try this out
because I'm almost out of serum I'm
either gonna use this or the other one
that I got in my glossybox which is a
truffle serum so definitely excited I
will definitely try this out and yeah so
I definitely think that was worth it I
think this beauty box is adorable it's
cute and you really do get some nice
deluxe eyes and full-size samples of
just you know could use the nail
polishes and serums so I love that I
love that there's a mix of hair care
skin care beauty related things makeup

really happy with my and I can't wait
