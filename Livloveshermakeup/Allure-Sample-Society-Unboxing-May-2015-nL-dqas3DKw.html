I'm just designating my videos to
unboxing videos for subscription boxes
so this next one and the one after this
will all be on subscription boxes this
is going to be the unboxing for the
allure system sample society box for the
month of May I am not affiliated with
them in any way just want to put that
out there um I just really enjoyed this
box and I will link below where you guys
can I also get you know start a
subscription if you guys are interested
so anyway I haven't looked in here yet
this is for the month of May like I said
let's get started in here they have the
little pamphlet that shows all the
products that you get this month and
then um here is what you get inside I've
always been really really happy and
impressed with this box I started it
maybe three or four months ago and I've
always really liked what I've gotten so
I obviously will continue to repurchase
this box so the first thing I see is the
longish a water sleeping mask and this
is it is a revitalizing mask with sleep
sent for all skin and it is an overnight
revitalizing gel mask infused with
orange flower rose and sandalwood
brightening antioxidant kunta apricot
extract and retexturizing chestnut
extract so that's really cool i'm all
about maths I love masking so this is
what the little product looks like and
let's take a look at the actual texture
it really looks just like a water like
watery kind of jail so smells really
really good I'm definitely excited to
try it out I love the thought of having
sleeping mask like once a week maybe
popping that on and sleeping with it
overnight so really exciting for this
exciting excited for this let's go and
look at what they wrote in the little
pamphlet it says the alum eh money hush
money age water sleeping mask what it
does an overnight hydration mask what it
does it draws in serious moisture
leaving skin looking plucked and glowy
and they create key ingredients are
glycerin and a trailer host which is a
moisturizer and beta glue go look blue
stone which fights in
it says how it looks / field / smells
this ice blue gel is as thick as pudding
with a faint Rose scent but it melts
quickly into the skin and then they say
why we like it the first time we tried
this Korean import to be expected to be
dry dying to wash it off but once the
cool non-greasy gel absorbed our face
with petal soft rather than sticky no
Jane no danger no danger of gunking up
the pillow case and extra luminous by
morning as dermatologists Doris Day
notes skin can lose a lot of moisture
while you sleep an overnight mask is
designated to help designated and design
to help it retain moisture protip day
suggest lay down and over your regular
anti-ager since it also makes everything
you apply uncommitted before bed more
effective and we're inclined to believe
her said she uses in non è che herself
so the price is $23 for a full size and
I'm really excited to try that out so
let's keep looking the next thing I see
is some a product that I have tried
before and I do like this is the otha
malla of being or a bein a thermal
spring water and so this is just
basically a thermal spring water and it
can you can use it to set your makeup
you can use it to refresh your skin and
I remember really really liking that
product so let's look it up in the
booklet and i'll meet you guys it says
the o thermal iving thermal a beam of a
thermal spring water what it is a skin
quenching water spray what it does it
calls and softens sensitive and dry skin
and the key ingredients are thermal
spring water iron magnesium news zinc
and copper which are antioxidants and it
says how it looks / feel / mouths look /
feel sighs smells good it's a not
familiar with water it feels wet it
smells like nothing and it's clear
hahaha in this case the spray is fine
enough that you feel refreshed and not
drenched and why we like it there's a
reason thermal sprays have long been
popular in Europe they contain minerals
as silicates and other trace elements
that suit sensitive skin and calm
inflammation we keep ours in the fridge
for an instant shot of relief from a
tight itchy situations just to be sure
to follow with the moisturizer
the good stuff and for 150 ml which is a
full size I have had the full sized one
before it's a lot bigger than this it is
only twelve dollars and fifty cents so
that's a great deal so really excited
about that I do love that product I
think I've gone through three full sizes
of that actually the next thing I see is
these jean with frida luxurious volume
physically full touchably soft seven-day
volume with protein and keratin in
shower treatment looks like this so it
looks like it's an inch shower treatment
not a shampoo not a conditioner um let's
read about it because I'm not quite sure
exactly what it is um it says he John 32
luxurious volume seven-day volume in
shower treatment and it says what it is
a gel you apply in the shower too washed
and conditioned hair then rinse out
before blow-drying to create fullness
that lasts through three to five
shampoos so that's really cool i like
the thought of that i think that's
really really awesome i like the thought
that i can use a product and then wash
it out and then it will give me vol4 you
know quite a few days or quite a few
washes I think that's cool Oh what just
happened my lighting sorry guys I don't
know rattle dark there when my hands
around okay get laid again all right so
it says here what it does the gelcoat
air with um polymers that pal me mires
that when set by heat or of a blow dryer
create a flexible layer around each
strand the coating is water resistant so
it lasts through several washing
meanwhile through acids penetrate the
air shaft to boost volume from within
key ingredients are pvp and vp /v a
couple limer which is adds volume and
hold and malic acid or bolic acid which
plums here how it looks / feels / smells
um it says the bright blue gel is creamy
enough to pass for regular conditioner
and it has a fairly strong fruity scent
and why we like it the allure editors
with fine hair have tried pretty much
everything on God's green earth to
achieve additional volume need to know
how that feels girls and which is why we
listened when they raised about this
invention as
one limp lock tester putted my hair
looked as full and bouncy at 9pm as they
had after i styled it inviting em I've
never found a product that can do that
that's huge for me even more magical the
effect really did last through an
average of three shampoos and it's more
like ah and if that's more like 10 days
for you hey we won't judge Oh depends on
how often I guess you shampoo your hair
and it says the magic is actually
science once the film on the outside of
the hair starts to wash away the malic
acid draws in moisture sis cosmic
chemist Nikita Wilson this causes more
pumping from the inside and even longer
lasting volume so the price for a full
size of 999 and it looks like the full
size has like a maze pump to it so
that's pretty cool I am excited to try
that I definitely have pretty um limp
flat hair so I'll be excited to maybe
get some a volume up in here the next
thing I see is a versace eau de perfume
sample and keep little gold box and i
love these little tiny ones are that's
uh cute so that's what it looks like and
let's read about it it says the versace
euros per fam and it says what it is an
easy to like hard to describe fragrance
it has notes of sicilian lemon bergamot
pomegranate Jasmine peony sandalwood
amber and musk I'm much smell like that
oh it's really really nice very light
very summery ah usually when i smell
versace a sense they seem a little
heavier this seems very nice and light I
like that a lot it says why we like it
you know how most fragrances are either
so light they disappear or so intense
they cling forever I dunno they said
this one is so well-balanced that it's
actually mysterious you know there's a
white flour in there but which one and
definitely absolutely some citrus know
lots of citrus and don't mistake subtle
for generic the whole thing is anchored
with just enough dark stately notes that
would be the sandalwood and musk to make
it very intriguing so the price is $92
for 1.7 ounces of course it's pricey but
I really like it really nice Barry oh
really really good really good I like
that a lot I think about you guys
goodness alright the next thing I see is
a julep lip gloss in the color graceful
as a beautiful light pink shade just a
little sweater swatch well we gonna show
up but that is what it looks like very
much like pink smells like candy
literally smells like cotton candy very
nice um to wipe this off you park it's
like stuck in my hair or something very
good though so this is the jewel of lip
gloss in graceful what it is a sheer
pink lip gloss with the slightest amount
of shimmer it says how it looks / field
it isn't sticky or tacky but it still
has reasonable staying power for a gloss
it is a little tacky that's just what I
felt but that's okay I mean that's what
makes the glasses stay all day it says
why we like it had everything required
to earn an honored permanent place in
your handbag the color is rosy enough to
give lips a pretty glow without being so
obvious that you have to apply it
precisely and the finish is perfect for
this brings no makeup makeup trend it
has the exact amount of sheen to give
your lips a healthy shiny look so great
full price which is obviously a lot
bigger than we got it is twenty dollars
so yeah pretty good and the last product
in this month's allure sample society
box it's too cute little box is the
caviar repair multivitamin heat
protection spray with vitamin b6 b12
siiii and biotin it says it is a spray
multivitamin for your hair basically so
you apply this it says on clean towel
dry hair you comb through to evenly
distribute and then you can style as
desired so it's basically like a
leave-in conditioner but it's a sprays
which is great because it just speeds
everything up so that is what it looks
like and let's read about it in the
booklet it says
alterna caviar repair multivitamin heat
protection spray wait is that ok so that
is right it says it is a weightless
styling spray that softens and protects
hair with or without heat so it does
protect from heat but you can use it as
a leave-in conditioner as well what it
does it smooth strands that are Dell and
frayed from over styling and helps
prevent further damage from flat irons
and blow dryers and then created key
ingredients are biotin and vitamins b6
b12 and E which smooth and protect hair
from heat how it looks / feel / smell
it's a lightweight and not particularly
sticky easy formula smells uncannily
like a mojito ooh I like that it says
why we like it heat protection spray
czar the haircare equivalent of
sunscreen you know you need to use it
but the wrong formula can feel heavy or
a mess with the products you later on
top not this one even with daily use may
never felt any build-up and other than
making our hair extra silky it was
totally unacceptable he dosent it almost
borders on citronella it's so strong if
you like it you're in luck we keep
smelling the west west of lime all day
if you don't like it well consider
yourself warned and so the full-size the
price is thirty dollars and it looks
like you get a nice size here so I'm
really happy with this month's box the
