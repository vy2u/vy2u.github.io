going to be doing enough of the review
for you guys today this time it is on
the new amazing cosmetics perfection
stick so basically this is supposed to
be a fun portable chubby stick that is
perfect for spat coverage and contouring
on the go the thought is that this is
not a contouring stick like you would
take it to actually you know make things
look smaller on your face it's actually
one that's supposed to be like a
highlight but it's supposed to be one of
those products that you use like
underneath or over like if you put your
contour here you would take this product
and put it underneath or above above the
actual contour so that it looks like the
contour is deeper if that makes sense
the concept is also that this can be
used as a almost like concealing kind of
product and amazing cosmetics makes
absolutely an amazing concealer that
really really thick full coverage one I
absolutely love it so when I saw that
this was out I thought I have to get it
and I'm really really disappointed I
don't like this at all I'm not going to
return it I'm going to keep trying to
play with it um I'm just not really into
returning makeup if i don't like it i
try and find him other way to use it so
i will keep using it and see if i could
find something that i do like to use it
for but overall i don't think it's that
great I was thinking there was going to
be a lot more coverage in this product
and also for $23 I just thought it was
going to be better than it is so they do
have four shades on the Sephora website
right now i purchased it like i said for
$23 almost 4.com website i will link
below where you guys can take that up
they have four shades the shade i got
was fair they also have medium tan and
deep so it does look like they're
catering to all different kinds of skin
tones this is the fair shade let me put
a little on my hand so you guys can see
as you can see it is a little deeper
than my skin tone but not too much it
does have a little bit of a peachy
undertone and I do kind of like that so
I'm not like saying that it's not a
perfect match or anything like that
because they do like it so as for the
formulation I actually think the
formulation is great if this was like a
concealing stick I would use it all the
time I think it glides on beautifully it
just has a really nice like it's very
easy you can just be like oh yeah just
covering
all these flaws but the fact that this
is supposed to be like a contouring kind
of stick I just don't like it it just
doesn't give the coverage that I would
consider using as a concealing product
and also it's just not a perfect match
for my skin tone to the point where I
would put it to highlight or to make my
contour like more accentuated I feel
like it has to be lighter than my skin
if I'm going to be doing that and this
is the lightest shade which is fair is
still too deep of a color so not a fan
of that I don't like that so let me read
a little bit for you guys what it says
on the actual Sephora website so you
guys can I kind of understand a little
more about this product because it's
it's a little weird it doesn't really
explain perfectly what it is is that a
concealer is that a contour product I
need to get in a deeper color so let me
pay for you guys a little bit about what
it says it says the amazing cosmetics
professions take cover in contouring the
go is $23 it is a creamy blendable
pencil that conceals contours and
highlights creating a flawless
complexion this fun and portable chubby
stick is perfect for spot coverage on
cheeks nose forehead and chin and also
contours and highlights where you need
it most available in forum neutral
shades that compliment every skin tone
the stay-put hard-working perfection
stick delivers flawless brighter more
even toned skin with a natural looking
finish it is formulated without parabens
sulfates and satellites or power if you
say that so also I just want to say
looking at this right now there's one
other review on here and does one star
so that just kind of shows you guys to
like what other people are thinking
about it and I'm kind of feeling the
same way and really try and find a way
to use this the way I like to but when
it says that it's a fun portable chubby
stick that is perfect for spot coverage
I'm like no it's not because it just
doesn't give enough coverage there's it
just doesn't yes it has a great
formulation it feels good it's creamy
but like it's so sheer there's just not
enough and then when it says that it
also contours and highlights where you
need it most well this color obviously I
can't contour with but like highlighting
I also can't use because I need a
lighter shade
highlight with than my skin tone and
this is deeper so that doesn't work
either um so basically what I'm thinking
this is going to be used for is probably
on the days where I need a really nice
like light concealer where I'm not like
breaking out too much I don't have
really deep dark eye circles so I'm
thinking that that's what I'm going to
use it for but overall I'm really not
very impressed with this product I give
it like one star out of 10 Oh out of 5
like it really it's just not that
impressive to me but um I will keep
using it and see if there's another way
I can play with it and yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed this review and i'll see
you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
