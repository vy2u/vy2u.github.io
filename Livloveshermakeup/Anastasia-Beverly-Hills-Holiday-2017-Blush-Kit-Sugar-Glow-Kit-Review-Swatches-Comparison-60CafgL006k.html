channel today I do have a review
swatches in comparison for you guys on
the new Anasazi of Beverly Hills holiday
2017 a sugar Glo kit as well as the
blush kit in radiant so we're gonna go
ahead and start with this baby right
here if you are wondering yes I do have
the prism palette on my eyes and yes I
will be going ahead and reviewing that
for you guys tomorrow so if this is a
limited edition a blush kit right here
it does retail for $30 on the Anasazi of
Beverly Hills comm website inside of
here you are getting a nice mirror as
well as four different blushes now they
have two different shades to choose from
one one of them is for like really
really deep complexions which i think is
wonderful you have like a contouring
shade in there as well as two blushes
and then this one is definitely for
those of you who do have like a
light/medium you know fair kind of
complexion I feel like the majority of
these would actually work for a deep
complexion as well but I'm just really
really happy to see that honest tossing
of Beverly Hills is acknowledging the
fact that it's really good to have
multiple different blush kits or
multiple different kind of you know
color selections so that everybody can
go ahead and get their hands on
something that they enjoy so these are
for full pigments of blushes for
buildable intensity with a seamless
finish it says apply individually or
layer more than one shade of Anastacio
anastacio on a frosty anasazi of beverly
hills holiday blush kit for a
multi-dimensional flushed complexion and
these are supposed to be finely milled
at formulas they have a seamless
blending effect full pigment formula for
buildable coverage all that good stuff
alright let's go ahead and just jump
right into the review as far as
pigmentation is concerned and as far as
like overall review is concerned I give
this 4 out of 5 stars this is a
fantastic fantastic little blush kit it
is very very travel friendly as you guys
can see I love that they did go ahead
and put a mirror in here but I really
kind of expected a mirror because I have
to say I feel like these are competing
side-by-side with the honest hacia
Beverly Hills blush trios now if this
one that I have right here is called
peachy love you can see gorgeous
gorgeous packaging going on right here I
could understand this beam like a
holiday release but I don't feel like
they did anything special as far as the
packaging is concerned for holiday which
is kind of interesting most brands do
but that's totally fine as long as they
want to you know leave their prices in
the lower range that's
find with me I just really don't love
the cardboard effect and I do always
like a mirror so I'm actually okay with
the packaging on this guy but the
formula between the two of these is very
very similar they're very finely milled
they're very soft they're very buttery
and peachy love definitely have a few
shades that are similar now I'm not
really a peachy blush kind of girl I
don't love warm toned blushes on me
personally but I love both of these
right here so this is definitely
something I would recommend you guys
check out and there are rumors going
around that the Anastacio Beverly Hills
blush trios will be going on sale
because they're being discontinued I do
not know how true that is because it
wouldn't make sense if they made this
limited edition and then they got rid of
these I don't really understand but if
these do go on sale they will be half
the price apparently at $15 so if you do
not like the actual shade selection in
the gradient or radiant blush kits for
the holiday season you can go ahead and
pick up one of these trios they have a
bunch of different shades so definitely
similar formula going on right there I'm
gonna go ahead and insert swatches for
you guys so you can see it in the
side-by-side comparison on top we have
the four shades from the blush kit and
then on the bottom we have the three
shades from peachy love the lecture trio
now as far as brushes are concerned when
I do go into this particular a little
guy right here I like to use something
that's a little more densely packed if I
really want to kind of build the blushes
these are very buildable very seamless
and beautiful on the skin so I do like
to actually layer colors together now I
wish I could have done a demo for you
guys today I did not have time this
morning or I don't have time this
morning to go ahead and actually film a
demo but today I did go ahead and mix
this shade down here as well as this
shade up here so we have a mixture of
burries and coastline and I really
really enjoy the kind of cooler toned
blush with the warmer toned blush I just
feel like it goes on beautifully so I
like to go in with my up-and-up this is
the blush brush you can get this at
Target it's the compareto brand and I
believe it is cruelty free I've had this
blush forever or there's a blush brush
forever and I just love the way it fits
onto the apples of my cheeks another way
to go ahead and get into these babies
since they are so pigmented if you are
super super fair and very very just fair
complected in general I would recommend
using something a little more fluffy and
not so densely packed as far as brushes
are concerned so this is the real
techniques blush brush and
basically we'll go in there I'll kind of
tap off the excess and then I just kind
of stipple it on to my cheeks and they
blend beautifully they really builds
beautifully on top of each other so if
you want to take one of the darker
shades and kind of work that towards the
back over here and then working later
color right here and then put
highlighter right here like I like to do
it looks very very pretty in my opinion
I do want to say really quickly off the
bat there is absolutely no massive blush
in here so if you're hoping that there
is a matte blush if there is not in here
now I don't know about the gradient kits
I'm not quite sure I couldn't really
tell from just looking at pictures but
when you look at these in direct
sunlight you can see there are two
shades that have Micro glitter and then
the rest of them do have a small sheen
it's not anything that I feel like is
super super noticeable on the skin the
same goes for the blush trios or at
least this one right here called peachy
love definitely all of them either have
a micro glitter or a really a finely
press kind of shimmer in there but I
might don't notice it that much on the
cheek so it's not anything that's going
to emphasize any sort of texture or
anything like that if you are wondering
all right guys the last thing I want to
touch on is a wear time these are not
amazing as far as where time is
concerned I definitely feel like my
Tarte Amazonian clay blushes stay on a
lot longer especially the original
formula the balm cosmetics blush is
definitely stay on better throughout the
day as well as the Too Faced I love
flush of blushes so if you need
something that's like all-day wear I
would recommend going ahead and maybe
getting a single of the tart or getting
these love flush blushes these are
fantastic from Too Faced in this shape
right here called Baby Love it's sort of
similar to one of these shades in here
called terrace it kind of fits into like
that nudie peachy category but this is
definitely a little more neutral in my
opinion and that goes for pretty much
all my Tarte blushes as well as you guys
can see like side by side I wouldn't
describe these blushes as like new to
blushes they definitely are more peachy
because you can see right here I have
sensual I mean this looks practically
like grey compared to that palette also
this guy right here which is called
seduce is a little on the cool tone side
but still very very neutral typical
tarts and then this one right here is
called risque again doesn't really fit
that well into this palette but as far
as like color dupes are concerned I feel
have found a few from the elf blush kit
in the light version and to kind of
match up a little bit here and then also
the elf pink passionate matches this
cool toned blush right here the Alpha
pink passion is a little more cool toned
but it still is pretty similar so I was
really surprised when I was going
through my collection and swatching out
you know colors because I really thought
that I had a million shades like this
but I told you guys earlier I'm not
really that much of like a peachy kind
of blush girl so I really don't but yeah
anyway that is pretty much it that wraps
up in this review and I let's go ahead
and move on to these sugar and glow kit
in here you are getting the shades and
gumdrop you are also getting a new shade
of starburst which was from the Kaleem
glow kit I never got my hands on that I
know a lot of people were wondering why
I was picking this particular palette up
it's because I never got the gleam glow
kit and I've heard great things about
starbursts it is the highlight I have
one today and it is just absolutely
gorgeous over here we have marshmallow
and then under here we have a
butterscotch and those are in it these
sweets and glow kits I really like
marshmallow so I don't mind having a
double and butterscotch I do like to use
lightly as a bronzer or a blush topper
so I would say gumdrop kind of have an
interesting shift to it it definitely
has a little more glittery as far as
formula is concerned I feel like the
best formula out of all the glow kits
because they do change up quite often
it's definitely the Sun dipped formula I
feel like all of these are very smooth
to the touch and this is very very nice
for all sorts of different skin tones
I'm not quite sure that the sugar glow
kit is going to be ideal if you have a
very very very deep complexion these
might look super super pearlized on your
skin but I feel like if you do have a
fair light or medium complexion this is
going to be great I still think if you
have a deep complexion butterscotch
would be great and beautiful on you but
if you are looking into the glow kits I
would recommend going ahead and getting
some dipped if you do have a deeper
complexion the shades in here are
beautiful the formula is just super soft
and silky and buttery and absolutely
amazing so I really really love this
particular guy right here my all-time
favorite glow kid if you guys are
curious is the Moon child that is a
whole different formula not going to be
showing that in this video because there
are no comparable shades by Tanja those
are the four shades so gumdrop is kind
of like a topi color with a little bit
of a pink shift to and
and these definitely or at least with
this one right here at gumdrop as well
as butterscotch have a little bit of
grit to them when you put your finger in
there you can see you get a lot of
product at once so I just wanted to give
you guys a little bit of a heads up I do
notice this guy goes on slightly patchy
to my skin and when I do look at this a
sugar aglow kid I'm not insanely excited
you know it doesn't look anything like
you know the moon child loket or the
aurora or the sun dip there's not a
whole lot of color going on here and I
think I've just got really into colorful
highlighter so this feels a little left
to me but it does have a bit of a pink
shift and it is pretty on the skin but
you have to be careful with it you
letter and then as far as starburst is
concerned this is just the most
beautiful creamy a beautiful cool toned
pink shade I love it it is what I have
on today and I just think it's
absolutely stunning so there is the
shade of starburst up next we have a
butterscotch and butterscotch is
definitely a little more chunky like I
said it looks darker in the pan but it
actually goes on pretty nicely I can
wear this as a true highlight right now
I am self tan so I just wanted to let
you guys know and that is what
butterscotch it looks like and then
finally we have marshmallow and that one
is an opalescent white color with a gold
shift going on and this one is really
really beautiful I don't mind having
doubles of this particular shape because
it really performs well and it's
gorgeous on the skin if you want to look
for dupes as far as these colors are
concerned I feel like the Urban Decay
afterglow highlighter in the shade aura
is pretty similar to starbursts a star
versus maybe a little more of like a
mid-tone pink that wants more cool toned
pink and as far as marshmallow is
concerned I do feel like the golden
lights a baked highlighter from makeup
revolution is quite similar alright when
it comes to applying these sugar kit
onto of my skin I have two brushes here
that I have really been enjoying the
first one is the wet and wild a unicorn
$3 and $0.99 brush you can get this at
Walgreens if you have a nice wet well
display I never do so I got mine at Ulta
this is fantastic for picking up those
kind of like in-between a big delay but
powder highlights I really enjoy it from
marshmallow as well as a sunburst and
then I'm sorry starburst and then when I
in a two gumdrop or butterscotch I will
take that same a brush I kind of pick it
up on the side and then just place it on
to my cheekbone and then I like to bring
it a little further down you don't have
to do that it will emphasize a little
more texture if you take it all the way
down to the apple of your cheek like I
do but I just like the way it looks I do
have to go in when it comes to
butterscotch and gumdrop with this
little guy after I apply it so I apply
with one brush and then I go in with
this and this is the lucky 5:22 tapered
highlighter brush I have to kind of wipe
away at the glitter I never really had
that big of an issue when it comes to
Nicole Guerrero glow kit just because I
really do kind of buff my highlight in
but these two shades right here gum drop
and butterscotch do leave glitter and I
don't like glitter because I'm already
you know bring me a little more emphasis
to pores and texture and things like
that when I bring my highlight all the
way down here so the last thing I need
is glitter on my face so I do enjoy this
brush but I wouldn't recommend just
going in with something super fluffy
like this and picking up these
highlighters just because they are a
little more smooth and firmly press you
want something that's a little more
densely packed like a brush like this
the one that I used today to apply a
starburst is this little guy from the
church treasured tools a brush set I
recently did a review on this little guy
I'll go ahead and throw it up in the
cards if you're interested this is
actually an under-eye concealer brush
but I just go in there I pick it up I
tap off the excess and then I just go
right on to a my cheek bone it applies a
lot but it's beautiful it makes it very
very seamless because the bristles are
so densely packed so there's no skipping
or anything like that and I really enjoy
it so overall I would say the blush kit
is definitely the one that has caught my
attention and the most the shipper kit
is nice it's nice I would give it you
know 3 out of 5 stars but it's not my
favorite glow kit from them I really
just wanted it because of this one shade
starburst but I feel like if you do have
a deeper complexion maybe you would want
to go for the Sun dipped of course you
can wear these if you want to but if
you're super super fair these might be
also a little dark on you at least two
of them are definitely going to be gum
drop and butterscotch so maybe go for
the moon child the moon child is
gorgeous on fair skin tones you guys can
go ahead and pick up whatever glow cat
you want I'm just trying to give you
recommendations based off of what I have
noticed with these bites yeah it's a
little lackluster it's not my favorite
glow kit like I said 3 out of 5 stars or
other holidays
that's right now and holiday highlighter
pallets that are definitely kind of
catching my attention a little more I am
definitely talking about this baby the
cover FX perfect highlighting palette
I just adore this this is a $39 this
right here is 40 you do get more product
here but you get more shades here so you
have a mirror here your really nice
packaging i do prefer this over this
glow kit do i prefer this over the Sun
decloak it or the moon child no but I do
prefer it over these sugar locate so I
don't think it's absolutely a necessity
especially if you do have a lot of the
glow kits by time yeah that's pretty
much it so thank you so much for joining
me for this a review I guess I will see
you guys tomorrow for my review swatches
and comparison on the prism palette bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
