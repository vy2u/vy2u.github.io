this video I have a review and swatches
for you guys on the new Anastacio
Beverly Hills a modern a renaissance
eyeshadow palette I purchased this for
$42 on at the Anastasi of Beverly Hills
calm website and I will of course the
link below in the description bar where
you guys can pick one of them up
yourselves if you are interested you do
get 49 shadows in here and this is the
first permanent eyeshadow palette to the
Anastacio Beverly Hills collection so if
you did want to get it you definitely
can wait a little bit you don't need to
get it right away it is permanent which
i think is awesome these are supposed to
be highly pigmented easy to blend taeju
get eleven matte shades in here and
three metallic shades as well as the
dual sided soft bristle brush so anyways
the outer packaging just has this
beautiful sort of ma beyond dusty rose
color going on with the ingredients
listed on the back as well as a picture
of the palette and then the actual
palette is like this beautiful velvety
sort of suede texture I absolutely love
it I think it's gorgeous again you have
that dusty rose thing going on it says
modern Renaissance which i think is
beautiful I love the name I love the
names in the palette I love the whole
theme the colors it all just goes
together really nicely and then you do
have a sticker on the back with the
ingredients as well so anyway you open
this palette up it does have a magnetic
closure you have a beautiful little
mirror here and look at these eyeshadows
oh my god these are beautiful you guys I
have never actually picked up any sort
of honest toffee of Beverly Hills eyes
shadow palette any sort of eye shadow
single I'm not even a huge fan of their
brow products to be completely honest
but this is an amazing palette for $42
you really should pick this up to be
completely honest when I saw that they
did like a sneak preview of this on
trend mood or was that their website I'm
not quite sure I think it was on their
actual Instagram page at their website
the anastacio Instagram page they did a
sneak preview and I was like oh but
those shades looks so like full full
like you know I was just like it's
springtime you know I was expecting more
pops of color but this is absolutely
beautiful and I think these kind of
shades the berries and the kind of deep
reds and mobs are really gorgeous any
time like any time you want to wear them
they're really really gorgeous um I do
have a few shades on from this palette
and I have layered them with my lorac
pro 3
if you guys are curious I will link a
review for that down below in the
description bar but I have a little bit
of bond fresco in my crease and then I
do have antique bronze on my lower
lashline and I did use as the antique
bronze shade with this particular little
brush that came with the palette not a
huge fan of this it's a little stiff I
like the thought concept they give you a
nice little shader brush which is nice
for packing on color on the lower lash
line which is what I did but then the
blending side is quite crispy and I just
felt like it was like oh that doesn't
feel very good when I was blending it
out on my lower lash line so not a huge
fan of the brush but I like the concept
especially for $42 getting a dual sided
brush and then getting these eyeshadows
as well so overall these are absolutely
beautiful in my opinion I actually would
compare the formulation of this to the
lorac Pro formulation which is funny
because I just reviewed this right
before this video I just think they're
absolutely beautiful my favorite thing
about them is that the mattes are the
same sort of quality as the metallic
shades they are so buttery and so creamy
and pigmented and I just love the way
that they go onto the eye I feel like
you can pair this with any sort of
eyeshadow primer that you desire and it
goes on really really nicely they're
very creamy very very blendable and I am
someone who does not like to blend my
eyeshadow I say that all the time on my
on my channel on my eyeshadow see that
all the time on my channel I just don't
like to sit there and blend and blend
and blend it's not my face so when I
find an eyeshadow palette that does have
a beautiful formulation where I can just
pop it in the crease blend it really
really quickly and it looks nice I'm
gonna go for it so I am overall just
really really impressed with this if you
do have the opportunity to the
opportunity to go ahead and pick this up
I really would highly recommend doing so
I think that this is a palette that will
show up on all different kind of skin
tones whether you have a really really
deep complexion a really really fair
complexion like me I think anybody is
going to like this as long as you are
into those kind of very deep tones it
reminds me a lot of my original lorac
palette and also reminds me of the
violet boss Holy Grail palette it has
those beautiful kind of berry tones if
you haven't been able to get the viola
boss Holy Grail palette I think these
are quite similar maybe I'll do a video
comparing the two but I just think
they're beautiful you get some gorgeous
transition shades in here
honestly I just don't have anything bad
to say about this pilot I think it's
absolutely stunning so let's go ahead
and starts watching shall we so I'm
going to start with the top row here so
the first shade is called tempura and
tempura is definitely a matte and it's
beautiful it kinda reminds me of like a
bone color it's just a perfect kind of
cream highlight shade and it's stunning
so there is tempura hopefully you guys
will be able to see kind of blends right
in with my skin tone the next thing we
have is gold and ochre and golden ochre
is this beautiful like light sort of
mustard shade it is a matte and it's
very very stunning I do want to show you
guys really quickly a few of the shades
in here do pick up a little more product
I don't experience any sort of Fallout
when I'm actually putting them on but
when I put my brush in they definitely
do have a little bit of powder kick up
not every single one mostly the mattes
but not every single one but yeah this
tempura color definitely does have a
little bit of kick up but golden over it
does not so heel here is golden ochre
and I just feel like it's such an
interesting color kind of like that
light mustardy I don't even know how to
explain it it's really interesting and
different and beautiful so at the top
here we have Tim Parra and then we have
golden ochre and again those are both
mattes and I love the formulation on
these they are just so buttery and so
soft the next shape we have is Vermeer
and this is a metallic shade it is
absolutely beautiful it's just that
perfect sort of champagne light pink
kind of color and it's just got a
beautiful amount of gleam to it I don't
even want to say sparkle because there's
something about these eyeshadows that
even though they don't have sparkle in
them they just look so freakin shiny on
the lid like a foiled eyeshadow so here
is Vermeer hopefully you guys can see
that and I have heard that the Anastacio
Beverly Hills metallic formula is to die
for and this is my first time
experiencing it but I had to admit I
mean that is beautiful like all over the
lid that color it just really really
pops and is absolutely stunning then
actually if we have is buon fresco and
it is this one right here which is the
one that I have a little bit in my
crease today beautiful beautiful like
matte transition color if you are going
in with kind of like the plumy tones in
here
like love letter or Venetian read it's
just absolutely stunning it's got this
dusty sort of lavender quality to it
it's very different and very special in
my opinion so there is buon fresco
beautiful oh my god the two of those
together in the mirror and bone fresco
yes loving it the next one we have here
is antique bronze and antique bronze is
the one that I do have on my lower
lashline today and it's beautiful it is
a metallic and it's a cool toned brown
with a little bit of silver and gold
shimmer in there this one does
experience a little more kick up than
the other ones as well but it still is
absolutely stunning it's interesting
that I do experience kick up however no
fallout whatsoever when I'm putting
these on so that's kind of cool again
it's my first time experimenting when
the Anastasio Beverly Hills I shadow and
then I am very very thoroughly impressed
so there is antique bronze absolutely
beautiful the next one we have is a love
letter this has to be probably my
favorite shade if the palette it is a
true berry tone and it is matte this one
does have a little more of a drier
consistency to it I noticed it right
away when i swatched it because my eyes
just drew to that color I was like oh my
god I want that on my eyes right now and
I do notice that this is the like most
matte of them all it really does have a
sort of I don't want to say chalky it's
not chalky the color is gorgeous it's a
very very pigmented as you guys can see
but the consistency is slightly chalky
and a little more dry than some of the
other matte shades but it's still
beautiful just a true berry so here we
have antique bronze and then here is
love-letter and I just love that color
it's a really really gorgeous I think it
looks a little lighter when you do
swatch it on your hand versus when
you're looking at it in the actual pan
but I still think it's beautiful and if
you wanted to you could totally wear
that as your pop of color like during
the springtime really stunning alright
so the next one we have is Cypress umber
and this is just a cool toned matte
Brown and I love it it's gorgeous it
could be perfect for the outer V on the
lower lash line as a liner whatever you
want it to be it can be and there it is
gorgeous
now we are moving on to the second row
the first one we have here is raw Sienna
kind of reminds me a little bit of burnt
orange and gold and ochre mixed together
it's got this sort of again greenish
muddy mustard color thing going on and
it does have a lot of kick up this
particular shade as you guys can see
it's kind of like this one right here
which is tempura it has a little bit of
dusty kick up I don't know what the deal
is with that I think it's just because
they're so soft and creamy although all
of the formulas seem to go on really
nicely onto the eyes and they seem so
identical when you do swatch them you
can see small little differences all
right so we have Cypress umber at the
top right there that matte cool tone
Brown and then we have a raw Sienna
right underneath it absolutely stunning
and the next shape we have is burnt
orange and I really like burnt orange I
think it's beautiful if you have really
fair skin and you want to do like a
really nice like warm like some OPI you
definitely could go into this palette
and use that as your transition shade I
think it's absolutely stunning and it is
a matte and this one doesn't have a lot
of fallout at all so there is burnt
orange and then we're also going to be
doing Primavera which is a beautiful
metallic true gold color it just looks
like there's like literally like water
on your eyelid when you're wearing this
it's so stunning it's beautiful like I
can't believe the shine on that so here
we have it burnt orange and then here we
have Primavera absolutely absolutely
stunning the next that we have is red
ochre and then we have Venetian red and
red ochre is gorgeous kinda reminds me a
little bit I mean the name obviously of
golden ochre but again the formulation
on it kinda reminds me a lot of golden
ochre it's just beautiful it's just this
really matte know how to describe it
just like a burnt red color it's got a
little bit of depth to it maybe a little
more burgundy undertones there it is and
then we have Venetian red which is
beautiful kinda reminds me of love
letter but love letter definitely pulls
more of a pinky purple II feel this one
definitely has more of a true red
undertone so there is red ochre and here
is Venetian red and in the last two
shades that we have our warm taupe and a
real rail guard real gar real gar real
car alright so warm taupe is just a
beautiful warm taupe II sort of color
again
that's sort of like mustardy undertone
been going on here with like Rossi and a
burnt orange golden ochre really really
beautiful so there is warm taupe right
there or just and then we have realgar
milk our I don't know how to say that
it's interesting and then this is a
burnt orange shade gorgeous oh my god
beautiful you guys I think if you love
these tones you just need this palette
for $42 it's so worth it that I've got
the quality this is just amazing the
pigmentation everything about it I'm
absolutely loving so overall I would say
definitely get your hands on this
palette if you are like me and you would
never have tried out the honest hacia
beverly hills formulation and you're
like oh i don't need it it's just too
hyped up it's not hyped up girl you need
it it is really really good I am very
very impressed if I could compare them
to some sort of eye shadow that I do
have it would literally be my lorac pro
formulation it's beautiful I feel like
the shimmers are pretty equal to the
mattes I just think the pigmentation is
amazing they're so easy to blend and
they're just amazing so I hope you guys
enjoyed this little review and swatches
I know I didn't have too much to say but
honestly it's just because these are
such good quality so let me know down
below you would like to see a comparison
video of this against the Holy Grail
palettes because that would be
interesting or if you'd like to see a
tutorial using this yeah just let me
know down below and I will see you guys
