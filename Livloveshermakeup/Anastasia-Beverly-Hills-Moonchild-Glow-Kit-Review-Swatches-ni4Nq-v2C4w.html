extremely giddy and there's a video I
just wanna say really quickly we just
found out that Tom passed his medical
boards my boyfriend's so anyway I'm a
little happy to look for in this video
but today I have a review and swatches
for you guys on the Neal Anasazi of
Beverly Hills the no kit this is in the
moonchild version and this is what it
looks like and I did purchase this for
$40 on the Anasazi of Beverly Hills calm
a website I'm gonna go ahead and link
down below in the description bar you
guys can pick this up if you are
interested it does retail for $40 and it
currently is even stock now this will
only be available on the Anasazi of
Beverly Hills calm website it will not
be available in store so you definitely
want to go ahead and order this online
if you do want it in this pilot you are
getting magically metallic highlighters
that offer a celestial skin and finish
it's a layer shades of Anastacio beverly
hills glow kits together or you can
sweep these separately onto the face
eyes and body for a kaleidoscope
shimmering effect it says free brightly
amplified go below you can apply these
with a damp makeup brush or a sponge as
well now you are getting six different
highlighters in here that are each 4.2
grams or 0.15 ounces each and this is
one of the actual shades look like so
let me read for you guys what they alike
likes to call these I guess you could
say so the first one is blue ice and
they basically describe that as a
diamond to white with an icy blue
reflect then you have star which is a
moonstone fusion of mint platinum and
silver reflect if you have purple horse
to which is the glittering lavender with
an Arctic blue reflect you have pink
heart which is a pearl white with a pink
opal reflect you have Lucky Clover which
is a shamrock infused gold with canary
yellow diamonds reflect and you also
have Blue Moon which is a frozen blue
with a silver of reflect so like I said
you were getting six different shades in
here and now I did also go ahead and
pick up the Anastacio Beverly Hills
sweets glow kit at the same time that I
purchased the Moon child I want to say
really quickly to you guys these
definitely are different in formulation
for sure none of the shades do each
other I know a few people
asking if Lucky Clover and marshmallow
are similar no Lucky Clover has more of
a dual chrome finish and then these are
just completely different this is my
first time experiencing them the Glo kit
formulation and I can definitely say
that these are very very different I
will be going ahead and reviewing and
swatching these sweets kit tomorrow if
you guys are interested but like I said
this is what the actual moonchild
palette looks like you were getting some
really nice icy cool tones in here and I
really loved the way that they presented
this particular palette so I followed
noir Vina and also just the Anasazi of
Beverly Hills brand on Instagram and I
loved the way that they push this out
into the market so they had different
bottles that were both female and male
and they also had different races and
they were all just wearing these
gorgeous gorgeous highlighters all over
their body or their faith or like their
chests like it was so cool I love the
way that they put that together I wanted
to mention that really quickly because I
hadn't heard anybody kind of acknowledge
that yet but honestly the presentation
was beautiful and impeccable and you
could tell there was a lot of time and
work and effort that went into that so
anyway the outer packaging looks like
this it is just a little sleeve as you
guys can see it says moonchild you have
the kaleidoscope sort of effect going on
here and then it does say Anasazi of
Beverly Hills you turn it over you do
have a list of the ingredients which I
love and by the way Anasazi of Beverly
Hills is a cruelty-free brand if you are
curious this is what the actual palette
looks like it is made out of cardboard
I really wish they could have tossed a
mirror in here I feel like that would
have been really awesome but you are
getting a lot of product in here for $40
and I can understand why maybe they
didn't go like full-on hardcore with the
packaging but for the most part I would
say the packaging is kind of weak on the
weaker side in my opinion I feel like
this totally could break off this does
not stand upright when you just put it
like this on a table it will not stand
upright it does close but there is a
little magnetic closure a little line
going on right here so when you do push
it together it does stay together so
anyway that's what the packaging looks
like again you do have the ingredients
on the back of the palette and then this
is what the actual shades look like like
I showed you guys so I
same right away you know these are
definitely different formulations I find
that the Glo kit formulation the
original like glow kit formulation or
like the sweets one or the Sun dripped
all whatever they're called all of them
basically have this very metallic
gorgeous sort of foiled appearance on
the skin I love the way that these go on
I think these ones are extremely
extremely pigmented and I think that
most people were expecting the moonchild
palate to be the same way they were
expecting it to go on full-on pigmen
just have full on color something that's
really like highlight on fleek II you
know what I mean and I just feel like
because these do have that dual chrome
thing going on they really aren't as
pigmented they are a little more gritty
and you definitely do get some kick up
with your brush now again when you order
this it is $40 and these are cool tones
almost bluish purple II highlighter so
you don't should understand what you're
getting at first and I know a few people
were saying they thought that these were
going to be more pearly rather than
duochrome but if you read on the website
you know they aren't describing these
actual shades as very much a dual chrome
finish so anytime that you are working
with a duo chrome products I do notice
that they don't have the same sort of
slip and vibrancy as say like a normal
like foiled eyeshadow or even like a
foiled formula kind of like the glow kit
formulation the original one um and I
don't know if that's because they add
extra Phillips fillers in there or
something like that but what I do notice
is that on the back here the ingredients
lists aren't different for the two of
these just so you guys know there are a
few very subtle little differences but
they are there so I think overall the
formulation is still really good on this
I know I saw a few reviews that people
saying they are going to return this
because it's not like the other glow
kits but again I feel like they didn't
really try and say that these were going
to be identical even on the Anastacio
Beverly host website and even like nor
vina posted on her Instagram that these
were different formulations they weren't
trying to trick anybody this is
formulated differently and also you know
you have six pans here versus four they
look different the packaging is
different I feel like this is a really
special sort of collector's item
and it really is sort of like stage
makeup now I am someone who is in the
arts world and I would definitely wear
the majority of these Shea
on stage I do have I think four shades
yeah I think I have four of them on my
eyes today I have the shade purple
horseshoe on my lower lash line
I have blue moon in my crease and then I
went in with star on like my outer V and
then I did take blue ice all over my lid
I don't think that these are impeccable
or like amazing when it comes to the
eyes I really feel like they started to
muddled together so if you are one of
those people you're thinking oh I really
want that Lucky Clover shade and that's
the only highlight out of use out of the
palette the rest of them I'll go ahead
and use as an eyeshadow that's really
not how this is going to work out for
you because they really do start to look
a little muddled together they're
beautiful if you want to take a pop of
color on your lower lash line if you
want to foil them or even just put them
on your lid but I would say when you're
working with areas that are not a flat
surface like your chin or down the
bridge of your nose or your cheekbone
these don't really have like sole impact
because they are duochrome so I think
they look the most beautiful definitely
on the cheekbone today I am wearing the
shade Lucky Clover star and blue ice all
together on my cheekbone they definitely
don't have the sort of pigmentation that
the original glow kids have or that the
sweets glow kit has at least but I do
find that they build quite nicely on
each other and although these are
duochrome and have little more grits and
a little more texture and glitter to
them they really don't look bad on the
face whatsoever I have been at work all
day it is now four o'clock at p.m. when
I am filming this and I noticed that
there was a little bit of product that
was starting to kind of emphasize and
kind of settle into my fine lines and
wrinkles I don't think it's horrible but
I really noticed that I didn't have that
issue when I was wearing it these sweets
glow kit yesterday I was not having that
same sort of issue so I do personally
think that these sit on the skin a
little better you do have to buff these
ones in a little more I feel like with
the Boone child's palette you definitely
can go ahead and just kind of dust it on
and it looks beautiful you can use a fan
brush with this you can use a sigma
tapered highlighter brush you can use a
buffing brush really whatever you want
but I do notice because they do have a
little more grit and glitter they
emphasize you know texture just a little
more but it's nothing crazy you guys
honestly it's really not a bad
formulation I just think when you are
comparing it to this formulation it
seems like it's almost like not up to
par when
but again I think they were going for
something completely different with this
the thought is that you can literally
put it anywhere on your body say you
want to be a unicorn or maybe like a
fairy for Halloween you literally could
dust these colors all over it like your
decal its hay or your neck or your chest
or whatever I feel like the thought
behind this particular palette was not
that it's supposed to be everyday wearer
friendly I think the thought is that you
use it for special occasions you collect
it because it's a collector's item or
you use it for stage makeup so I do like
it for what it is like I said I know
that there are a lot of people that want
to return their pallets because they're
like oh I just wouldn't wear this as a
highlight well I don't think a lot of
people would wear this every day as a
highlight if you want to that's awesome
I mean there's nothing wrong with that
but for the most part I don't think
everybody would want to wear a blue or a
purple highlight every single day I
thought I personally think the thought
concept was that this was a very kind of
artistic palette the way that they
presented it to the world I really
thought that it was kind of artsy fartsy
and also I just think it's a collector's
item so yeah if you really love
collecting the glow kits if you really
want something different and unique in
your collection this is a beautiful fun
palette to have you can use it on your
eyes although I would say the wear time
is better on like a flat surface I
personally feel like these do start to
crease a little bit when it goes into
your eye area but you know if you want
some sort of a special collector's item
and also you just want something unique
and different this is a really fun
palette half so anyway let's go ahead
and do some so watching the first shade
that I will swatch for you guys it's
blue ice now I will say let me show you
guys up close when you swatch them you
definitely can see that there is some
texture there and I notice immediately
when I go in with my finger or with a
brush because these are duochrome and
because they do have a little more grit
to them and glitter there definitely is
some kick up so I just want to show you
got that guys that were really really
quickly yeah but here's the first shape
this one is blue ice and that is that
pearly color with that beautiful violet
undertone so there is blue ice the next
shape we have is called star and star is
actually really buttery and kind of
foiled they do have different finishes
going on here in my opinion and star is
just a gorgeous white pearl color with a
gray undertone I really like this one I
think it's beautiful and if you do
have a cool-toned complexion like I do
you probably will really like this
palette in general so there is the shade
star the next shade is purple horoscope
and this is the one that definitely has
the most grit to it it has lots of
chunks of glitter and it is the darkest
in the actual palette it's right there
it's really really beautiful you guys
but it is a little harder to work with
if you really want this to show up you
do have to foil it or build it up so you
want to spray your brush with a little
bit of setting spray or you just want to
make sure that you are layering it but
it's still really really gorgeous so at
the top there we have blue ice
underneath we have star and then we have
purple horseshoe super super beautiful
and then the last row is pink hearts oh
lucky clover and blue moon and I have
this whole entire palette my favorite
shade is definitely Lucky Clover it's
this gorgeous one right here which is a
pearl finish with like a green shamrock
under Tony it's amazing you guys but the
first one is pink hearts again you're
getting that pearly finish but this one
has a pink undertone really really
beautiful again you could put this all
over your lid and it would look awesome
but I think if you try and work these
colors into you different areas that
kind of like go in and have a little
depth like your crease it doesn't work
that well they do start to get a little
muddled together but there is the shade
pink heart pink cards so so so pretty
and then we have Lucky Clover which is
my favorites and I'm wearing that tape
on my cheekbones I love it I love this
shade I think it's absolutely beautiful
this one you definitely have to build up
a little more and I am showing you guys
these swatches built up so please please
know that so I am building these up a
little bit for you guys there is the
Lucky Clover Lucky Clover is a pearl
with a shamrock green undertone and then
the last sheet we have is blue moon and
I don't know why this reminds me of
Sailor Moon but it does this is kind of
like the shade purple horseshoe oh my
god it just kicks my camera sorry this
is kind of like the shade purple
horseshoe but this one is definitely
more of a lavender undertone well no you
have the Pearl undertone and then you
have the lavender mixed in there it's
really beautiful so there it is so here
we have pink hearts we have a Lucky
Clover and then right there
we have blue Mona the best formulations
in here are definitely star and blue
moon I feel like they don't have as much
grit and glitter in them those are my
two like favorites as far as formulation
is concerned
prettiest colors are definitely Lucky
Clover and purple horseshoe for me and
then I do like blue ice and pink hearts
so I think that this palette is really
really cool it's a fun concept you have
to understand what they were going for
this is not everyday wear friendly okay
it's not like they're expecting you to
go put purple highlight on and go to
work or something like that I think it's
really just a collector's item it's kind
of one of those items that's really
beautiful to look at I know that sounds
so weird but if you are a makeup
collector you understand and I think
that overall the concept is just that
it's unique and it's different and you
can use it for what you want to use it
for but I don't think that they're
trying to tell you to go to work with
like purple highlight on so if you are
someone who's really not interested in
these colors if you can't imagine
wearing something that's very cool toned
or duochrome
on your cheeks then I would just go
ahead and not pick it up definitely go
pick up one of their glow kids they're
stunning they have a beautiful
formulation and they have more wearable
colors but in my opinion this is a
really fun little palette have yes you
do have to build and work with the
colors a little more than you do with
the original kits but I still think it
is a really nice little collector's item
to have so I hope you guys enjoyed this
little review and swatches thank you so
much for joining me and I will see you
guys tomorrow for the review and
swatches on this sweets kit bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
