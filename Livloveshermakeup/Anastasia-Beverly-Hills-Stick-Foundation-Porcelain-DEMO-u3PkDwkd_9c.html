this video I have a review not a review
this is going to be the demo this is a
demo on the new anastacio Beverly Hills
stick foundation now I tried doing a
review demo and also swatches on this
and the summer lip gloss set in one
video bias it was 27 minutes long 27
minutes along you know I don't edit my
videos so that was just no no that was
not good I also tried to go ahead and do
just the review and demo of this and if
that was also like 17 minutes long it
has like why this damn video so long so
anyway I am going to be breaking these
up I hope you guys don't mind I will go
ahead and put this one up first and then
I will have the review go up right after
and I will make sure that I link below
in the description bar so that you guys
can go straight to the review I'm sorry
you know it's just the way it is I know
I don't edit my video so it's a little
harder for me to do but I did want to
come on here and go ahead and demo this
for you guys
so anyway and this is the honesty of
Beverly Hills stick foundation it
retails for $25 you get 0.35 ounces or 9
grams of product in here and the shade
that I picked up is called porcelain
this is a little light for my skin right
now so i will be doing some bronzing at
the end if i'm going to show you guys
how i like to apply this so with half of
my face i'm going to apply it with a
damp sponge and with the other half i
will apply it with a dense brush my
favorite way to apply it is with a dense
brush you can use the Real Techniques
expert face brush or anything else
that's kind of like that this one is the
elf selfie brush and I really really
like this as well that's the one I will
be using and then I will be setting
everything in with my maybelline
superstay better skin skin transforming
powder now when you see the review I do
talk a little bit about how this doesn't
necessarily need to be set in but I will
be setting it in so that I can have
better staying power powder power better
staying power throughout the day alright
so I did go ahead and prime my face
already with my YSL sushi cloth this is
a blurring primer and it is very very
silicone based and then I did go in and
put on my Maybelline eye primer so I am
all primed and ready to go and we are
just going to go ahead and take this
foundation and we are going to just
start putting a
us on and I am going to do basically
three swipes on each side of my cheek
and then three on my forehead I actually
you know what I'm not I'm gonna pretend
like I have like some special methods
I'm doing I just kind of swiped this all
over the place and we will go ahead and
we will do two layers of this and then I
want to build it around my eye so you
guys can see also all right so this side
of my face I am going to blend with the
damp sponge and I really don't like the
way that this goes on with a sponge but
I knew somebody would ask I want to see
this but yes as you can see I'm doing a
lot of like swiping and pulling motions
and I'm sure you guys can see right away
this is really really light on me and it
was funny because anasazi a Beverly
Hills on their Instagram page they were
saying this particular shade is
comparable to nc15 and that is I'm
usually an NC 10 to NC 15 during the
winter time and I don't know why I guess
I just thought that I myself tanner
wasn't working as well as I thought but
yeah this is very very light on me so
anyway alright so there it is completely
blended in with a sponge on one side of
my face pretty decent coverage it is I
would say medium to buildable full
coverage so there it is and now we are
going to go in with the elf blurring and
selfie brush I don't even know if they
offer this anymore but anyway what I
like to do is spray it down with a
setting spray this is the NYX matte
finish setting spray I'm just going to
go ahead and spray that down a little
bit and then I'm going to go ahead and
buff this in two of my skin and this is
definitely my favorite way to apply it I
feel like it goes on really really
nicely when I do this no streaking and
also it's a lot quicker than the sponge
so there it is this side was with the
damp sponge and this side is with the
brush I have no idea if you guys can see
but I do see a difference I don't like
it with this side you may not be able to
see on camera but this side is starting
to kind of go into you my pores right
here at this side is just kind of you
know gliding right over them alright
we're going to go ahead and do the same
thing again I am going to reapply it I
will say one of my favorite like parts
of this foundation is the fact that it's
so easy to just like put onto your skin
so travel friendly so compact really
really awesome all right same thing
again we're gonna take the damp sponge
on this side and I want to show you guys
how this kind of builds up on the skin I
feel like when I push like this like if
I bounce it it really it doesn't give me
it doesn't blend it just doesn't blend
so I really wanted to show you guys with
the sponge you do kind of have to pull
ends that it's not really something you
want to do for your skin but also with a
Beauty Blender usually you bounce it or
with a beauty sponge or a spongebob I
call this little guy my spongebob so
hopefully you guys can see how that kind
of built around some of the areas where
I do have a little bit of scarring and
then we will do the other side again
with the elf selfie or blurring brush
Wow what just happened there you see
it's like a big red spot I just gave
myself a little bit of hives and no big
deal guys just keep going on just keep
moving on alright so there we have again
I don't know if you guys can tell I'm
looking into the mirror like right below
me and I definitely can see a clear
difference between this side and this
side this side looks a lot better and I
feel like this side just like my pores
everything's starting to fill into my
pores basically wow that was really up
close and personal alright so lastly
what I want to do is go ahead and put
this around my eye area to show you guys
basically what it can do as far as like
covering dark circles and things like
that because I'm sure some people want
to know do I need to use a concealer and
I think that it is smart to go in with a
little bit of extra concealer obviously
this is not made for the eye area is
very very big so it's kind of hard to
get in there but I just wanted to show
you guys and I also will do a little
more in this area where do you have some
hyper pigmentation all right again what
we are going to bounce this and blend
and then I'm going to flip the sponge to
the pointed side to go ahead and blend
the eye area so I definitely think it
gives quite a nice amount of coverage
but I do think that if you want the most
coverage you definitely should apply
with a brush and also I think that you
could go in with a concealer if you go
in with a color corrector and then you
go in with the foundation I think you'll
be fine but if you do have a lot of blue
tones I didn't get that much sleep last
night I feel like I'm a little blue but
not too blue underneath that is
definitely something you could do so
anyway that is how this applies if you
guys see my review which you will after
this video I will let you know that it's
really not necessary to go ahead and set
this in but obviously oh wow look at the
color difference here is this like super
white and then I'm tan down here so I
will be setting it in with a powder and
then going in with a little bit of
bronzer and also I do feel like that
this lasts a lot longer if you do set it
in so
I'm going to use my maybelline superstay
better skin skin transforming powder in
the shade number 10 porcelain and it
looks like this and I will just be
taking this big fluffy brush right here
from Ecotools and I am just going to go
ahead and lightly set this in I'm not
going to take anything too densely
packed usually I like to go ahead and
really like stipple on my powder and I
really pack it in quite heavily with
like a kabuki brush but I'm not doing
that with this because I feel like
that's too much setting like it just
doesn't need to be set that much because
this particular foundation is really
like made for those who do have oily or
combo skin and if you do have normal
skin I highly recommend using a
hydrating primer I tried with a
hydrating primer I did get a little oily
but I prefer how this goes on with a
smoothing primer just because it does
help to blend the product out that is
one thing about stick foundations is
that they really do dry down pretty darn
quickly alright so after I have set that
in I am going to use a little bronzer as
well we got one still looking a little
white in the face so I will be taking my
Muru Muru butter bronzer from Physicians
Formula in the shade of bronzer and I'm
just gonna take my big up-and-up fluffy
fluffy fluffy brush and I'm just gonna
dust in there lately and just kind of
put this all over my face oh it's not so
good oh yes oh my god you guys seriously
this products good and hopefully that
will do the trick and I will match a
little better so that I don't look like
I have to so colors to colors on my skin
alright guys so that is it that is my
demo on the foundation stick like I said
I will go ahead and post the review
right after this and if you are watching
this later like tomorrow or something
like that it will be linked below in the
description bar so here is a close-up of
what my skin looks like with this
particular foundation and now that is
that thank you so much for joining me
guys and I'll see you in my next one
