video is going to be a review and
swatches on the new honest hacia Beverly
Hills stick foundation i purchased this
for twenty-five dollars on the Anasazi
of Beverly Hills calm website I've a
link below where you can pick it up as
well if you are interested they have so
so so many shades they have even lighter
shades than the one that I picked up at
this particular shade is called
porcelain I think it's the third two
lightest shade they have stuff for cool
undertones warm undertones neutral
undertones I'm super super light super
super dark you guys know if you are very
fair skinned or if you a very dark
skinned it is so hard to find a
foundation that matches you so I really
do appreciate that and yeah you are
getting nine grams or 0.3 5 ounces
really 0.35 ounces of products in this
particular foundation stick which is
about average for a foundation stick now
an average foundation usually has about
a full fluid ounce of product so that's
just something to think about at first I
was like oh $25 like that's so amazing
but really you're not getting that much
product in here so this is basically
supposed to be a highly pigmented
buildable cream foundation stick with a
natural matte finish it is ideal for
normal to oily skin types and I'm very
glad that they went ahead and said that
on Instagram they said that on the
website I think that's really good
because this is not going to work for
you if you do have dry skin more mature
skin even if you have normal skin you
really are going to need to probably use
a hydrating primer I do have a demo for
this particular product if you would
like to watch it it's linked right down
below in the down bar yes its link right
down below in the down bar so I will
have a you know little link for you guys
if you would like to go see how I
personally like to apply it to my skin
and what the actual shade porcelain
looks like on the skin and I also will
have a time stamp down below if you just
like to fast-forward to the swatches so
anyway here is the outer packaging just
a nice matte black box and it has the
Anasazi of Beverly Hills logo as well as
the shade name and then the actual
packaging really seriously looks like a
little lipstick I love this it's rose
gold that says anastacio Beverly Hills
you open it up and you have this rose
gold plated thing here and I'm going to
twist this up all the way this makes me
very nervous but and this is what the
actual foundation stick looks like that
is the amount of product you get I have
warnings
quite a bit because what I find is that
you know any sort of cream foundation
stick whether they're really really dry
or really really oily I do wear them
down pretty darn quickly so I didn't
want to go ahead and point that out but
for the most part I would say this is a
very good standard foundation I'm not
absolutely obsessed with it I do not
know if I would go ahead and repurchase
it but i also don't hate it i think it
is quite good it definitely is exactly
what they claim it really gives a nice
like deming that sort of appearance to
the skin and if you're someone who does
struggle with oily skin or if your
breakouts and things like that this will
give you the coverage to hide those
imperfections and also it will help so
that you don't turn into an oily beef at
the end of the day I personally like to
use this with a really silicone like
primer because stick foundations can be
a little more difficult to actually
blend out on the skin my favorite way to
apply it is definitely not with a sponge
which is usually my favorite way my
favorite wait definitely to apply it is
with a buffing brush I really like to
kind of buff it into my skin something
really densely packed and I do spray the
brush down first with a little bit of
setting spray but the one that I am
wearing today with this particular
foundation is the YSL tushy cloth this
is just a really really nice silicone or
DeMatha cone primer the Maybelline Baby
skin is really good anything that has
like a really nice slip to it I think is
the best way to apply this particular
foundation if you are trying to apply it
and you do have normal skin I would
definitely go ahead and wear a very very
hydrating primer I notice if I build it
up too much in the areas where I tend to
be a little more dry like on my cheeks I
definitely definitely can see little
patches of dryness so anyway I would say
the finish of this reminds me a lot of
my nards velvet matte skin tint and
actually it kind of has the same
coverage level as well this one maybe
has a little more coverage than this one
but this one can also be built up which
this one can as well so I really really
like that about these two foundations
and I really do like that they don't
make you look completely flat and matte
there is like a little bit of something
there and I really really hold on one
sec mmm-hmm I had something in my mouth
anyway I really really like the effect
that it gives on the skin I think it's
beautiful it's slightly luminous just
ever so slightly luminous and I think
it's really amazing now I do set mine in
because it does help with the where time
if you don't set it in I would say the
where time is anywhere between six and
eight hours if you do set it in with a
powder it's eight to ten that's what I
have experienced or noticed after using
it for a couple of days and i think the
where time is pretty it's pretty good
it's pretty good i have i have better
foundations but i do think it's pretty
darn good so i will say also um if you
are applying this like i said just make
sure that you are using something that
has a little bit of slip to it and you
want to go ahead and buff that into the
skin immediately after applying it so
overall i think it is a very very good
foundation i do like this shade which is
called porcelain they did right on the
instagram page that this particular
shade is equivalent to like an NC 15 I
feel like this is a little lighter um
but it is a nice match or it will be a
nice match for me during the winter and
fall time when I am NOT self-tan but let
me show you guys how this kind of blends
into the skin it's not super super dry
it's not super super oily it just goes
on to the skin really really nicely and
like I said it gives just this really
really pretty kind of subtle Sheen to
the skin so like I said if you do set it
in with powder you will get like extra
where time sometimes I just set it in in
my t-zone but for the most part you
actually don't have to and I feel the
same way about the NARS velvet matte
skin tint if you do have comp rly skin
you don't necessarily have to set this
in depending on how much you use and
it's the same with this one so really
really cool I also love the fact that
this is so travel friendly this is
probably going to be my go-to travel
foundation stick because you can build
it up so if you want full coverage you
definitely can get uh you know you can
definitely get that from this I feel
like this really can cover dark circles
it can cover you know just acne marks
acne scarring I think it's I think it's
a really good product um for that but
overall what I say it's like my favorite
foundation no but I think it is good um
the price is good everything is just
about really really kind of average just
a little bit a little bit above average
when it comes to the actual finish and
when it comes to the fact that it is so
sleek and travel friendly so anyway i
hope this was helpful like i said if you
want a dental it will be linked below
thank you for joining me and i'll see
you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
