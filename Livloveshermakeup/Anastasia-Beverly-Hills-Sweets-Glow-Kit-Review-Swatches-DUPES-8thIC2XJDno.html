today's video I have a review swatches
and also some dupes for you guys on the
new honest hacia Beverly Hills glow kit
in the Suites version I want to say
really quickly I have been itching and
scratching at my eyes all day they're
very watery and itchy today so I'm sorry
if I start rubbing at them I can't help
it anyway I did purchase this particular
palette on the Anastasia Beverly Hills
comp website for $40 it is currently in
stock so i will leave a link down below
where you guys can pick it up if you are
interested this is exclusive to the
anastasia beverly hills calm web site
and it is limited edition so this is a
collection of four metallic powder
highlighters for intense luminosity it
says you can layer them together or you
can wear them separately on the face and
body for a radiant glow there are four
different highlighters in here they each
have 7.4 grams of product or 0.26 ounces
of product in here which is ridiculous
the pan size is absolutely huge and from
what i have heard this is the identical
formula to all of the other glow 'kiss
except for the moonchild one which I
went ahead and reviewed yesterday so the
four shades that you are getting in here
are marshmallow which is an intense pair
with gold reflect I found a dupe for
that you also have sassy grape which is
a lavender with blue reflect you have
taffy which is a fusion of peach pink
and gold reflect I also found a dupe for
that and then you have butterscotch
which is a caramel gold with white
reflect and what I say dupes I mean
color dupes just so you guys know so
anyway the outer packaging just looks
like this it's just a little sleeve as
you guys can see on the back they do
have the ingredients list and Anastacio
Beverly Hills is a cruelty free brand if
you are curious and this is what the
actual palette looks like it is made out
of cardboard and you do have the
ingredients again listed on the back
there is a magnetic closure towards the
front there is no mirror and when you go
like this you can see that there are
four gorgeous highlighters right there
they are magnetic so you can pull them
out and you can mix and match all of
your palettes together and overall I am
very very impressed with the quality and
also just the shades in here now I had
somebody writing to pretty much every
single person on my last review
yesterday on the moon child pallor
saying people were asking about this
particular palette saying can I use it
if I have fair skin and the answer is
yes you can use anything no matter what
you know this person was going and
responding to everyone insane no you
can't use it it's meant for dark soon or
no you can't do this or you can't do
that I just wanted to say really quickly
although that they although they did
kind of show when they did the campaign
that this was mostly used on those who
do have darker skin this still shows up
on fair skin just for a reference I am
an NC 10 to an NC 15 and Mac foundations
currently I am south tanned and I am at
about an NC 20 I would say but I can
still wear these and today I do have the
shade butterscotch and also marshmallow
on as my highlight so I just wanted to
bring that up really quickly makeup is
something that you can use for whatever
you want you can use these of blush
toppers you can use them as highlighters
you can use them as eyeshadows so I did
want to touch on that really quickly
just because they were kind of you know
with the campaign they were showing that
this is meant for darker skin tones
doesn't mean that people who have
lighter skin tones can't use it so
anyway these do all show up on my skin
tone which is awesome and I definitely
think they will show up on all different
kinds of skin tones even deeper skin
tones the sassy grape shade and also
this shade down here which is called
taffy or more blush toppers on me
personally but these two shades right
here definitely are highlighters on me
so anyway I really like the formulation
on these I think they're very buttery
very very pigmented very foiled looking
on the skin and I think they look
absolutely stunning when you have them
on your cheekbones I will say I don't
really prefer using them on my eyes I
don't know if I'm getting a little
irritated like with my eye area today
because of these particular highlighters
like I said I have really itchy and
runny like watery eyes today I normally
don't really get allergies so I'm not
quite sure if it has something to do
with the actual formulation of those but
what I noticed was that these definitely
started to kind of blend together if you
do want to use these as eyeshadows I
would recommend just like you know
popping them on the lower lashline or
even just popping them on the lid and
then working your way in with another
palette you need a good transition shade
you need a good eye good good you need a
good matte brow bone color things like
that a nice definer shade so I'm not
going to say that this protect
particular palette will put together a
whole eye look for you but you
definitely can use these
shadows and I think they go on quite
nicely like I said I do have a little
bit of eye irritation today so I don't
know if it's because of this or if it's
just because my eyes are irritated I'm
guessing it's just because my eyes are
irritated but for the most part these do
work as eyeshadows as well as
highlighters and also blush stoppers the
actual pigmentation is amazing just
absolutely stunning off the charts I
will say when you do pick product up
with your finger as you can see there is
a little bit of texture there and
immediately with these reminded me of
where the Urban Decay afterglow ate our
powder highlighters I have three
different shades I have aura fireball
and also sin and I find the same thing
when I put my finger in here I just get
a little bit of texture when I'm picking
the actual product up these definitely
are not like a baked Jala sort of
formulation they definitely are a little
more powdery so you do have to be
careful when you dip your brush in there
for extra kick up it does start to come
up with the actual product and also when
you're blending you want to make sure
you're putting them exactly on the areas
where you want them because I do find
that they can start to over blend and
you do get a little bit of fallout and
they will start to go in different areas
that you don't want so that's just
something to be aware of my favorite way
to use these is definitely with like a
sigma tapered highlighter brush or a I
really like the what's the other one
that I really like oh the lucky hack
tapered highlighter brush I like as well
that's what I use today I wanted with
butterscotch and then I went in with the
shade marshmallow and I put that on my
cheek bone I love the way that it went
on I think they go on really foiled and
very very beautiful very very
beautifully I should say and I feel like
your finger definitely picks up a lot
more product which is probably why it
looks a little more textured when you
actually dip your brush in there I feel
like it really goes on evenly onto the
skin so that's just something to be
aware of but overall the formulation is
absolutely fantastic this is my first
time experimenting with the regular
formulation of the glow kits and I want
all of them now i want the sun drenched
or sun dripped dipped won or whatever
it's called
I want the gleam won I want all of them
I think these are absolutely beautiful
if you have never had the pleasure of
trying these out you definitely should
you basically are getting these huge
pans for ten dollars apiece which is so
worth the money and they just go onto
the skin so beautifully I really do feel
like any sort of skin type could you
this if you have oily skin if your combo
skin if you have dry skin ageing skin
it's not going to settle into fine lines
and wrinkles I just feel like it goes
onto the skin very beautifully and it
kind of sits on top of the skin but not
in a bad way like emphasizing anything
it really just glides on like a foiled
like shadow or a foil kind of
formulation so anyway pigmentation is
there the wear time is really incredibly
strong on these I've been wearing them
all day on my face and I don't feel like
they're going anywhere I think as long
as you are wearing a foundation or a
primer and using a setting spray these
babies will stay on all day as far as
the eyes are concerned I do notice that
I get some creasing with them could be
because they are so kind of foiled and
also I do notice that they don't stay on
my eyes nearly as well but again today
I'm having very runny kind of watery
eyes but for the most part I think these
are beautiful as blush toppers or as
highlighters and I would highly highly
recommend checking out the glow kits or
this particular glow kit if you were
interested in the shades now again I do
want to touch on the thing where
everyone's saying this isn't meant for
fair-skinned
like I said right now I'm at about an NC
20 with self-tanner on and I can still
get away with wearing these so don't let
anybody tell you you can't do this or
you can't do that because of your skin
tone I think that this palette works for
everyone it just depends on what you
want to use it for so anyway let's go
ahead and starts watching these babies
I'm going to start with this one right
here which is called sassy grape which
is a beautiful beautiful purple color
with like a silvery undertone I love
this shade I think it's absolutely
stunning like I said I have it on my
lower lash line today this is what it
looks like so there is sassy grape look
at the reflection like that I was going
to say the reflection it literally
almost is like a reflection like looking
in a mirror
the reflectiveness is just absolutely
insane
the next shade that I'm going to swatch
is marshmallow which is that beautiful
beautiful pearly color with kind of like
a golden iridescent to it I love this
shade and again if you do have
fair-skinned this definitely will show
up on you like very nicely and it is
lighter than the skintone so there is a
marshmallow the
next shade that we have here is a
butterscotch which is a beautiful kind
of golden color it's got a lot of warmth
to it and I do notice there is a little
more grit with this particular one I
think it has a little bit more fallout
and also just a little more chunks of
glitter but for the most part I would
say that all of them have the same
formulation this one's just a little
grittier so there is a butterscotch and
I do apologize if the lighting is going
in and out in this video we have clouds
and then we have the Sun and then clouds
again so I apologize about that and then
the last shade that we have in here is
called taffy and Taffy's is that
beautiful sort of rose gold shade that's
what I would describe it as it's really
gorgeous
it definitely has more of a reddish
undertone but then you have that peachy
glow it's probably like the prettiest
shade in here although I do prefer
marshmallow I still think this is a
beautiful beautiful color so there is
taffy so here are all of the shades
together really really beautiful very
light reflective they're gorgeous they
wear an incredibly long time I
absolutely absolutely adore them so
again here we have the shade sassy grape
underneath it we have marshmallow and
then we have butterscotch and then right
here we have the shade taffy so let me
go ahead and show you guys the dupes
that I found these are color dupes so
I'm not saying that they have the same
sort of formulation or anything like
that but I do think that there are a few
dupes out there or a few products out
there that you definitely can do these
with so though two tubes that I found
are for the marshmallow shade and also
the taffy shade so for the marshmallow
shade the dupe that I found is from the
makeup revolution vivid baked
highlighter line and this is in the
shade golden lights so here is
marshmallow and here is golden lights
and I will go ahead and swatch those
next to each other so you guys can see
they are just so similar they both have
that really really gorgeous like pearly
color to them oh my gosh I definitely
did not swatch that very well but they
both have that very very golden pretty
quality to them and they have that
gorgeous gorgeous luminescence so on top
we have marshmallow and then we have the
baked revolution highlighter in the
shade golden lights on the bottom
i'm sorry i swatched it and the two of
them almost connected in the middle but
does it look similar they're very very
very similar now I don't feel like the
makeup revolution highlighter stays on
as long and I also don't feel like it's
as buttery and creamy but it's still
beautiful and I feel like the shade is
pretty much spot-on
and then they do plan I found for the
toffee shade down here which is that
beautiful beautiful kind of rose gold
shade with the light reflective gold
undertones in there I would say the
shade dupe that I found is from the Wet
n Wild mega Glo collection so they have
the new one and they have the older one
I feel like this one definitely dupes
this color a lot better than the new one
but they both are pretty similar this is
the Wet n Wild mega glow illuminating
powder in the shade three four five
catwalk pink and this is one of those
highlighters or lumen aiding powders
that has different shades so when you
mix all of these together it looks very
very similar to the taffy color there it
is
let me go ahead and swatch that and then
I will also go ahead and swatch um the
new light catwalk pink one right next to
it so there is taffy there is catwalk
pink they're not in execu but they are
very very very similar and then here is
the new packaging for the catwalk pink
and I'll go ahead and swatch that as
well I feel like this one is the
slightly lighter in my opinion it just
has more of like a pinky undertone than
like a peachy undertone but I mean I may
just be me guys who knows you'll have to
let me know what you guys think but
anyway here are the three of them here
we have taffy then we have the old wet
and wild packaging and the new one wild
so anyway those are pretty darn close
I'm not saying these ones are exact
dupes but I feel like the marshmallow
one is definitely an exact dupe so
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
review and swatches and these little
dupes I really really am enjoying this
lo kit I don't have anything negative to
say about it I think the price is right
the formulation is beautiful this stayed
you know the staying power is really
really incredible and I definitely think
you guys should check this one out I'd
like that they have all these different
glow kits with different um I was going
to see different flavors with
different sort of colors going on so of
course you can pick the one that you
would like for your particular skin tone
but I really really like this one and I
have very fair skin so really really
happy with this purchase I hope you guys
enjoyed this review thank you for
joining me and I'll see you guys
tomorrow
