channel today's video is going to be a
review and swatches on the new nicole
guerrero glow kit this is from Anastacio
beverly hills obviously I did purchases
for forty dollars on the Sephora comp
website so I will link down below in the
description bar where you can pick it up
if you are interested I already knew
that I wanted this definitely for sure
because I really do love the UH Nastasia
Beverly Hills glow kits I do own the
moon child glow kits I recently picked
up these son dip - glow kits you guys
will see this in a haul from Ulta next
week and I also do have these sweets
glow kids so if you would like
side-by-side comparisons or swatches or
dupes on any of these definitely let me
know down below but yeah let's go ahead
and jump right into the review so like I
said that this does retail for forty
dollars on the Sephora calm website you
do get six different pans of product in
here and each one contains a 4.5 grams
of product so this is what it looks like
on the inside a typical kind of
Anastacio Beverly Hills packaging you do
have the little slip which does get the
ingredients list on the back and then
also if you guys were curious on
associate Beverly Hills is a cruelty
free brand they never put any sort of
mirror in here which I don't really like
but I know for the most part they do
kind of want you to like deep hot these
or put them in like a Z palette or
whatever kind of palette you want to the
normal ones like this one right here Sun
dips come with this little thing where
you literally can just kind of like push
them out but as you guys can see these
pans are a little bigger these are 5
grams I believe or maybe even 6 grams so
yeah these are 4.5 grams each and you
are getting a nice shade selection in
here honestly you're getting some deeper
tones over here and then you are getting
some lighter tones over here I feel like
they did really well with like warm
tones and also cool tones I honestly
feel like this palette will work for
everyone if you are very very fair
complected for every young kitty cats
and ass of the shade right here forever
lit will definitely work for you i right
now ma pout in nw20 in mac foundations
and those three shades work really
really nicely for me as highlight if you
have a medium complexion i feel like
every single shade is going to work for
you and even if you do have a deep
complexion I feel like it's gonna work
for you as well now the formula is
beautiful you guys very very smooth I
don't want to see so much like buttery
and soft because there is a little bit
of like grit when you put your fingers
in here not so much grits but just like
stickiness these are almost like
Dometic own sort of foiled eyeshadow
formula but if you have played with the
other glow kits in the past
besides the mood child if you played
with any of the ones that are like
permanent you would know what these
actually feel like so they have a very
thick kind of texture to them but they
are insanely insanely pigmented so the
kind of payoff that you are going to get
here is very very strong as far as color
payoff is concerned and the wear time is
really really good on these as well so I
find as long as I do have a nice like
foundation on a nice tacky foundation or
I put a setting spray on these do lasts
about 8 to 12 hours on my skin and the
way that I personally like to apply them
is with two different brushes I usually
go in with a sigma tapered highlighting
f-35 brush just to initially put the
color on and then I do like to buff it
into my skin with this little guy right
here which is from Lexie this is the 512
small contouring brush now I know uh
Nastasia Beverly Hills also does own an
actual brush like this or they have a
brush like this where you really can
kind of buff it into your skin but the
one thing I want to advise against is
really be careful when you do put your
brush in there you do not need to do
this okay you do not need to go in there
and pick up that much product it is just
not necessary you really want to make
sure you're tapping off the excess
because if you put that much product on
even with a brush swatch here you guys
will see you're going to get a huge
amount of color payoff so these really
do have that kind of high shine impact
look on the skin definitely less is more
with these in my opinion I would start
with gradually building layers but if
you do put on too much you are going to
start to notice a little bit of emphasis
on fine lines texture wrinkles things
like that but for the most part you guys
these are beautiful they are like the
kind of formula that I'm used to from an
honest ostia Beverly Hills glow kit if
you have one of the ones that have like
the quads in them or the four pans
you're going to love this one as well I
think it's beautiful the one thing you
do have to be careful with as well as as
you guys can see is some of the powder
duster to go into the other shades as
you can see they are kind of closely put
together but for the most part really
really beautiful you just have to be
careful with that kick up and that fall
out so yeah as far as that is concerned
I think pigmentation is great I think
where time is great color selection is
great I'm just very very impressed with
this and I don't feel like there have
been a lot of palettes recently that
I've been like go out and buy but this
one I really think you should I really
do think it's worthwhile so let's go
ahead and get into the swatches I'm
going to start with the top row right
here
the first shade we have is kitty cat
which is the one I do have on today this
is a really beautiful kind of peachy
color it's got a little bit of like a
cool tone pink color with like a peachy
this mixed together and definitely a
gold Sheen so here is what the actual
shade looks like and so here is the
swatch of the shade kitty cat really
really beautiful the next shade that we
have here is called Forever Young this
is one of my favorite shades very very
beautiful it has a little bit of a cool
toned kind of iridescent to it now I
find that there are like a few like
purple undertones in here it almost
reminds me of like a holographic sort of
effect it's definitely not like it has
like a full-on shift to it but it's kind
of like a grayish color with a little
bit of like a purpley iridescent so if
that one looks a little dark in the pan
don't be worried as you guys can see
this shade might hear it right here
kitty cat may actually be deeper on the
actual skin than this one is so if you
were worried about this particular shade
glow getter if you were red or I'm sorry
Forever Young if you were worried about
that one not being light enough for your
skin if you are fair complected I'm
pretty sure it still will be and then we
also have the shade D dream and I was a
little worried about this one you guys
because when you look at it you
literally can see the glitter particles
which is something that I normally don't
notice with honest hacia Beverly Hills
glow kits however I will say those
glitter particles just do not actually
show up on the face so if you were
worried about that don't be worried
about it you guys it's still very very
soft and creamy the one thing you have
to do with this guy is just kind of
build it up a little bit on the skin so
if you do have a medium complexion with
a warm undertone I think this would look
stunning on you and if you do have a
very fair complexion you can use a very
fluffy brush and actually use this as a
blush which is what I did the other day
so there are the first three shades
swatch now we will go to the other side
we're going to go down to Forever litt
which is reminds me a lot of Becca's
pearl it's a cool toned white color with
a little bit of almost like a blueshift
to it now this one is quite chunky I'm
not gonna lie it was kind of
disappointing for me at first because I
was like oh my god I thought this was
going to be the only one that would be a
true highlight on me it's not like I
said the two other shades kitty cat and
Forever Young are beautiful as well but
this one definitely picks up a lot of
product at once you have to be very very
careful you can see just with like a one
swipe swatch you may have to kind of
like blend
that in so definitely definitely if you
are going to be using this highlight I
would highly recommend going in with
some sort of like a buffing brush and
really doing small circular motion so
you can make it look more skin like
because this is the one that I think has
the tendency to look slightly patchy on
the skin so there is that shade but you
can see once you kind of blend it out it
looks absolutely beautiful then we have
a glow getter which is a really really
nice kind of standard Goldy color this
does remind me a little bit of what is
that the laura geller baked gelato swirl
illuminator in the shade gilded honey
this one maybe has a little more of a
peachy iridescence to it but there it is
if you guys can see gorgeous gorgeous
and then finally we have the shade 143
which is more of like an antiqued kind
of gold so it's got a little bit of a
cooler undertone and maybe a little bit
of like a moss enos to it like almost
like a green undertone but still really
really beautiful as you can see and a
shaded deeper so here are all six shades
for you guys to see from the Anastacio
Beverly Hills glow kids the nicole
guerrero collaboration right here we
have the shade kitty cat beneath that we
have Forever Young and then we have day
dreams so there are the first three and
then on this side we have forever lit we
have glow getter and then we have 140s
rage so definitely a beautiful beautiful
glow kit again just super super
impressed with Anastacio Beverly Hills
so glad that a collaboration has come
out that hasn't sucked because recently
there have been a lot of pallets in
general even if they're not
collaborations just a lot of pallets in
general highlighting pallets as well as
eyeshadow palettes I've been really
disappointed with but this is one of
those things that I would say if these
colors interests you absolutely buy it I
really do think it's worth it so yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed this little review
if you're someone who is a huge
highlighter lover and you really like
that wham bam in your face kind of
highlight and this is definitely
something you should get and yeah that
is pretty much it thanks so much for
joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
