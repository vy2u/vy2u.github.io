in this video I am sharing with you guys
what I got in my April 2016 boxy charm
box so let's go ahead and unbox this
together I have a little paper towels
you'll hear ready to open this box
because all of the stuff and you guys
can see like the little pieces of like
confetti stuff they get all the products
all gunky looking I really don't like
that but anyway I mean here we have this
little card right here which tells us
what is in here and i will read that off
for you guys as i go through but yeah
let me wipe this off so the first thing
i see here is the Anderson Lily this is
the number 5 manhattan beach beach
butter hand cream and i am all about
that hand cream life so this is really
really fun to get this is what it looks
like and this definitely looks like it
is indeed a full-size let me go ahead
and smell it because smells mean a lot
to me and i have to open up oh babe go
ahead okay so oh it smells really good
it actually smells like being down on
the beach kind of like salt water and
stuff like that so I actually really
like that really cute packaging as well
and on the card it says anderson lily
full-size hand cream it says let your
skin indulge in a luxurious and soothing
blend of bergamot citrus White's Jasmine
Brazilian helo troop and musk how to use
apply to dry hand Oh wah wah okay so
that is a lovely lovely black Brett
brand that is a lovely lovely blend of
fragrances and it smells really really
good so I'm excited to try this out and
that is a big ass hand cream alright
moving on the next thing I see in here
is the ofra long lasting liquid lipstick
I just drop the card the over long
lasting liquid lipstick in the shade
pasadena it's a very beautiful sort of i
don't even know how to describe it kind
of like a ma vie your lips but better
sort of shade let's go ahead and swatch
it and that is what it looks like really
really pretty
and on here it says let's see here /
long-lasting lipstick this is a
full-size this is a full-size is
actually kind of small it's are these
full sizes really okay well this is a
full size of an overwrought long-lasting
lipstick and it says / long-lasting lip
sticks I is a full-on lip color that
does not feather it is creamy and soft
in texture it nourishes the lips and
moisturizes the lips and it contains
antioxidants and vitamin E so that is a
very beautiful color this is kind of a
small products but I guess it is their
full size alright moving on the next
thing I see is the pur Lisse a daily lip
nourisher with mango and shea butter now
I got this in a mile or beauty box I
think last month I actually did not like
this product so I'm going to go ahead
and I'm not gonna like open it up or use
it or anything like that I'm probably
just going to pass it on to a friend or
my boyfriend see if it works for that
but it says the purely slip comfort that
is a full-size and it says this advanced
Lipner sure is enriched with mango and
shea butter Cahawba and rice bran oil
and vitamin E that richly hydrates and
seal in moisture this exclusive
petroleum free bomb heels dry and
cracked lips without leaving oh I'm
sorry leaving them nice and lush and
soft and moist and youthful looking I
didn't like it because i felt like it
actually made my lips a little more dry
so i don't know what that's all about
but I'm gonna see if my boyfriend wants
it alright the next thing I see in here
is the Blake black lash primer so that's
really cool this is what it looks like
it comes in like a little tube like this
and let's see can I open this how the
heck does this come out there we go and
this is what it looks like so yeah it's
very very cool i love lash primers i
don't know why i'm just really into them
i feel like they really do help your
mascara to look like thicker and nicer
on your lashes and they make everything
look like longer and just awesome and I
think it's really cool that this is in a
jet-black formula because the one that i
use i actually used today is the Urban
Decay one which has like a really really
like white look to it so you really have
to layer the mascara on to make sure
that you're covering the white color but
that is a very cool and it says let's
see here the lash primer builds a volume
and
have your mascara looking the blackest
of relax the innovative silicone wand
separates and lengthens while they blink
black lash primer coat slashes very very
well and then the last thing I see in
here is am your minerals sweden in I
guess this is a pigment in brown
hypnotic so that is what the little
packaging looks like and this looks like
a beautiful color I'm not gonna swatch
it because oh yeah loose pigments are
kind of a mess but it looks like it's
just a beautiful sort of topi purpley
color um let's see maybe I can swatch it
a little bit it's kind of like a topi
purpley color definitely very very loose
I'm not a huge fan of blues pigments but
i think i'll try it out with my
political move primer so anyway that is
everything that I got to in my April
2016 boxy charm box i hope you guys
enjoyed this quick little unboxing thank
you for joining me and i will see you in
my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
