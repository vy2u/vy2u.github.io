channel in this video I am sharing with
you guys what I got in my April 2016
GlossyBox so what this is going to be my
unboxing video for the month and yet
let's check out and see what we got in
this month's box so here is the
GlossyBox we have the little tissue
paper and then the little card that
tells us what is in here and I will of
course read for you guys everything that
is in here once I go through it so this
is what this month's box looks like on
the inside and i guess i will start with
the brightest thing and that i see here
which is the Layton Layton Denny nail
polish this is a beautiful color this is
in the shade pillow talk and it's kind
of like a gorgeous um plummy berry
fuchsia color can you guys see that
really really beautiful let's go ahead
and read about this product so the
leighton denny expert nails this is the
nail polish in pillow talk and this is a
full-size and this is $19 you do get 0.4
fluid ounces a product in here 0.4 fluid
ounces of products yes it says the
perfect color for winters transition
into spring this very huge polishes
everything your accessories closet has
been asking for so that is the first
item the next thing I see here is the
unani dermo defense facemask and this
looks like it's definitely a full size
you guys know I love face mask so let's
go ahead and read about this this is the
unani dermo defense face mask this is
the full size it is eighteen dollars you
do get 3.4 fluid ounces of product in
here and it says hydrating and
protecting the skin is exactly what the
dermo defense facemask promises to do
combining a low and algorithmic herbs
your face will thank you with a glowing
visage so that looks really really nice
i am very very excited to try this it
says it's recommended for sensitive skin
and you can use it one to two times a
week alright moving on the next item
that I see here is the from the alterna
brand this is the caviar CC cream extra
hold for thick hair tended one complete
correction creme this is what it looks
like I have tried a few products from
the alterna brand
for I like some of them and some of them
I don't like but I'm excited to try this
it says layering tons of styling
products on top of each other is both
time consuming at a drag things to
alterna you can now say hello to your
new best friend caviar CC cream with
extra hold this tended one styling
product protects your hair while giving
you the main of your dreams and the
full-size is twenty-five dollars and the
full size is 2.5 fluid ounces and here
we get to 0.85 fluid ounces alright
moving on the next item I see here is
from Studio 10 this is the brow lift
perfecting liner it says look good and
feel better supporting women with cancer
and there it is and let's open this up I
can get it out alright so this is what
it looks like it looks like it is a dual
sided product and I'm guessing that you
get like a highlight yeah a universal
highlight on one side and then the brow
lift pencil on the other so let's go
ahead and swatch this quickly this looks
like it's a nice brow pencil like it's
going to be a universal shade for
everyone kind of like a topi color and
then the highlights or the brow lift is
kind of like a beige yellow color and it
does seem to have a dry and kind of
formula which is nice because it's
easier not to mess up your brows when
you do have kind of a dry or formula
like that all right so it says the
studio 10 brow lift perfecting liner
full sizes twenty dollars and it is one
piece and I think that that is a
full-size it says browse have made a
major comeback and to help you sift
through endless products we brought you
studio tens double sided brow liner to
naturally define and highlight so there
is I'm excited to try that out i love
brow pencils those are like my favorite
things for my brows they don't really
like the pomades or the powder so i'm
very very excited to try that one out as
in the last thing I see in here let me
double check to make sure it's the last
thing because the other day I messed up
in my Ipsy bag I only took out four
products and realize there was a brush
hiding at the bottom of the bag
anyway the last thing I see here is the
bios onto the nourisher this is the
precious rose face oil I'm so excited
for this I love anything rose and I have
tried a few products from the bios
honest line I think they were called
these squalane or squalene drops we got
those a few months back but this is the
nourisher precious rose face oil I have
to smell it to see if it smells like
rose because yes it does i'm all about
that rose life you guys so I'm so
excited for this I honestly think that
rose oil or rosehip oil anything like
that is very very nourishing and
beautiful on the skin and also quite
brightening so I cannot wait to try this
out it says the nourisher precious rose
face oil it says blended with an elixir
of roses this luxurious facial oil adds
a shot a powerful vitamin C and plant
derived squalane into your skin care
routine so it does have the squall line
or squealing drops in there which is
basically like an oil that comes from
the fins of sharks I believe or like
their liver or something like that like
an oil and I was worried about that at
first because I don't really believe in
that I didn't know that like the
specific kind of sharps that they take
the oil from our danger time just not
about that life but then I looked a
little more into the actual bioscience
brand and it turns out that they
actually derive it from a plant so if
you're worried about that don't be
worried about it and basically the
squalid drops just help to retain
moisture in your skin so this is a
precious like a blend of Rose face oil
and the squalene so it says it has
vitamin C and plant derived squalane
into your skin care routine
simultaneously preparing as it locks in
moisture the nourisher is a must-have in
for a full size it is $72 and that is
101 fluid adds a product for the 72 $72
full price but in here we get zero point
14 fluid ounces or 4 ml so that is a
nice amount especially because it's an
oil you only need like three or four
drops of this so I am very very excited
I would say that was probably my
favorite item in the box second favorite
would be the face mask love masking
third favorite would be the nail polish
and then the brow product and then
our product so overall I think blocking
box did great this month again I love
glossy box honestly it's like my
favorite subscription box by far I feel
like 421 dollars a month you get so much
good stuff and so many full-size
products so I hope you guys enjoyed this
unboxing of my April 2016 GlossyBox
thank you so much for joining me and
i'll see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
