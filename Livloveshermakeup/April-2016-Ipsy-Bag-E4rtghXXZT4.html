is going to be my April 2016 tipsy I'm
bagging I was gonna say if see unboxing
it's the I'm bag a kind of in a bag this
is the pink baguette comes in and then
when I opened it up I saw this little
pouch I have not peaked yet I just took
out the little couch but this is what
the little pouch looks like for this
month or at least this is the one I have
so it's orange and yellow on one side
and then it's like blue tie-dye and
orange on the other side I'm not a huge
fan I've gotten cuter ones but it's
still adorable and then this is it see
right there alright so let's open it up
and see what is in here so first thing I
see oh I got so excited this is the tart
winder lipsurgence lip cream this is
what it looks like and I actually love
these let me grab here we go I have a
bunch of these little deluxe sized
little mini lipsurgence uh whatever
these are lip creams or lips urgences
from Tarte so I'm super super excited i
don't think i actually have this color
if i do then i will just give it to a
friend but let me swatch it to show you
guys it's a beautiful kind of like
plummy red color and if you're familiar
with these you know that they smell
really good and you just paint them on
like a little lip crayon so I'm super
excited that is very very cute that is
the lip surgeons in wonder from Tarte
and then the second thing i see is from
em cosmetics that is the michelle phan
makeup line this is the great cover-up
ultimate concealer in fair warned which
is great since i am a fair so let's see
what this looks like this is what it
looks like and let's go ahead and put it
on the back of my hand so that i can
figure out if this is going to be a good
shade match or not alright it looks a
tad bit dark so i may have to give this
to a friend there is it's very very um
yellow tones but it seems like it has a
really nice consistency yeah that's
definitely too dark for my skin but
that's okay it seems like as a nice
consistency a little on the oily side
but still very nice alright the next
thing I see is from the moroccan oil
brand which i'm very excited about I
really love this brand this
the Moroccan oil treatment this is just
the regular one I have tried this before
this is an amazing amazing Moroccan oil
treatment and I really really like this
so that's a very exciting that I got
that in my bag I remember it smelling
really good and making my hair super
super soft I think I tried the lite
version but this is awesome it says
apply a small amount throughout damp or
dry hair so there is and then the last
thing I have in my bag is the a destiny
or a desk New York organic it fused nail
lacquer this is a gel effect nail polish
and the shape that I have is oh very
very pretty this is called arena which
is a beautiful kind of dusty grey blue
color let me shake it up it's a little
separated but dusty grey blue color
isn't that pretty oh yeah I'm very very
excited so I really happy with
everything that I got I may not be able
to use the concealer we'll see maybe I
could use it underneath foundation and
then put my foundation on top or kind of
use it as a color corrector since it
does have a little bit of a yellow
undertone but I'm very excited about the
tarte lipsurgence the moroccan oil and
also the nail polish so i hope you guys
enjoyed this little on bedding ixc 2016
april 2016 bag thank you so much for
joining me and i'll see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
