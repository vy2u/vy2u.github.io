my channel this is going to be a little
bit of a get on ready with me and also
my empties for the month I know this is
totally random I'm already behind on
video so sweet because I skipped a day
and today I tried uploading a video and
it was taking 4 hours to upload it and
it was only a 50% it would have been
eight hours to upload that so I
cancelled the upload I'm gonna see if I
can go ahead and just upload that
tomorrow but if not I will refilm it for
you guys but yeah I asked on snapchat if
you guys wanted me to do kind of like a
skin care or get unready with me or put
like my skin you're on with you get
ready with me and then also share my
empties for the month and a lot of you
said yes so let's go ahead and jump
right into that we are going to start
with toning up my face so hopefully you
guys will be able to really see it my
skin with this new of camera but right
now I'm really just having redness
around my mouth from over practicing and
then I have a bunch of like dark circles
this week because I have been so
exhausted it's been a very very long
week so anyway what I am going to do
first is take one of these nip plus fab
dragon's blood fix cleansing pads and
I'm just going to go ahead and apply
that all over my face and these are
really nice and soft and I really like
the way that they tone and the skin I am
kind of avoiding at my mouth area
because these do have Stella so like
acid in them but they also have
hyaluronic acid and they have Dragon's
Blood which is a type of plant and it's
supposed to be nice and hydrating so if
you are looking for a good fella's feel
like acid kind of cleansing pad that
won't dry you out and this is a good one
all right I'm gonna go ahead and let
that kind of sink in it let's start on
some empty shall we the first two items
that Tom and I did use up this month
aren't even up sharing Merlot a deep
cleansing hand soap from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works as well as the very Mary meringue
so both of these were pretty darn good I
know Tom prefers this formula with the
deep cleansing eye but I know that they
also like those little microbeads those
are gonna be taken off the market so I
don't know if we would repurchase I'm
still unsure on the whole bath and
Bodyworks you know cruelty free thing
it's just so I just I can't get a clear
answer and it really bugs me but this
does smell really really good and this
one I actually included in last month's
lifestyle favorite so both of those were
good and we would possibly repurchase I
did use up this little thing at the
first a beauty facial
radians paths it says they exfoliate
tone and brighten the skin very very
similar to the Peter Thomas Roth and
wrinkle appeal pads but these ones you
do keep on the skin so you don't wash
them off right away but they were pretty
darn good and I might consider
repurchasing first a beauty does not
test on animals which is great Peter
Thomas Roth does but yeah these were
they were good like I like the you know
the results I get with them but I feel
like they kind of sting on my face and
they're a little sticky and tacky so I
prefer using them at nighttime and then
we did use up a little uh what is this
well flour do a pack of the frosted
cranberry wallflower is this smells so
good it says they sparkling blend of
white cranberry juicy peach and wild
strawberry I have that in the beauty
room right now all right now is that the
toner or a little cleansing pad has kind
of dried it down we are going to jump
right in to our main like ingredient of
the night and that is the nip plus fab
exfoliating glycolic fixed overnight
purifying gel I'm going to combine the
two of those together just because they
are from the same line I mean they both
have cell silica acid in them and this
is just what I have been enjoying using
on my face this week as far as a
nighttime treatment is concerned I've
mostly just wanted to kind of exfoliate
my face I guess you could say because
it'll dry but I haven't been having like
huge amounts of breakouts or anything
like that which is awesome so this is
really good if you are a little more
combo or oily skin I really do enjoy it
it does have a glycolic acid and cells
those asked it in there so you are gonna
be a little red and tingly after but it
is worth it this is good stuff you guys
alright let's move on to some more
empties I did use up the Pacifica happy
essence hydro mist I thought this was
just okay I'm not gonna repurchase it I
much prefer my Mario Badescu facial
sprays we did also use up these Theo
Bigelow cashmere fig hand wash the smell
amazing I have no idea if they are
cruelty free but I really like the
little container and it really did smell
good so would possibly because it's that
Burt's Bees finally did officially go
cruelty free like come on it seems like
they should have a long time ago so I
will definitely be repurchasing this it
is the Burt's Bees cleansing oil with
coconut and argan oil
my friend Darlene
this to me and I love it so really
really really what recommend that is
beautiful really really nice thin
consistency but it takes up all the
makeup really nicely and then we do have
two more deep cleansing hand soaps in a
French of vanilla french vanilla French
lavender and Honey Crisp apple this one
I loved at first and then it gave me a
headache but this one smelled really
good so we probably would repurchase
that one if we were going to a little
anything alright I did also use up the
hemp's white peach rose a and peony
herbal shave gel this is a limited
edition if vegan is cruelty free this is
so freakin good you guys it smells
amazing it really really helped so that
I didn't get any like mix on my legs and
I liked it was like a really really
thick creamy kind of gel so I would
definitely consider repurchasing really
enjoyed that let me sit on my tea hearin
mm-hmm I'm a the way if you're curious I
am drinking what is it tea vaana's
jasmine woodland I think and it's
supposed to be caffeine for you
hopefully alright guys so after that has
kind of sunk in a little bit I am going
to jump on it two of my Mario Badescu
facial spray with aloe cucumber and
green tea I'm gonna move on my mug here
so that I don't get that in there and
I'm just going to go ahead and miss this
on two of my face were a little bit of
extra hydration and you can go ahead and
put your eye cream on and then you know
finish off with this sometimes I just
like to let it sit for a little bit
before I go in with my eye cream I will
probably do my eye cream off camera
because I really like to let the Stella
silic acid and glycolic acid sink in
before I go in with something like this
um but I do want to use this on my lips
because my lips look like this is
the Tony moly
kiss kiss lip balm in a blueberry so I'm
just gonna go ahead and pile that on to
my son sad lips this is really really
moisturizing I know uh huh you guys can
see it's kind of like a Vaseline and
yeah I've got some practicing marks I
just I over practice I also hurt my
thumb yeah you should never do that
don't do that guys alright moving on
let's go ahead and get into some more
empties we have bc gorgeous and i woke
up like this
she masks these are from viable or vol
these were just okay they're not cruelty
free
it says paraben free gluten-free non-gmo
but I don't think they're cruelty free
but they weren't of that great they
definitely made my skin look smoother
and a little more like
and vibrant but I didn't notice that
much of a difference Tama I did finish
off the Sunday Riley table a brightening
enzyme water cream he did tell me that
he prefers the belief true cream aqua
balm so I will go ahead and pick that up
for him but I really do like this one it
has hyaluronic acid in there so it binds
in the moisture and also it does have
blanket on the name right now it's that
something in there that will help with
hyperpigmentation and to kind of lighten
up the skin and that is the majority of
what I have been dealing with lately so
I really love this would repurchase
probably gonna get it during the sale on
let's see here bozhe this is the
charcoal pore pudding I loved this I
wish a bozhe was cruelty free this is
such a good smelling mask it really
decongest support it's really really
nice if you do have calm or oily skin
but like I said they do tests on animals
and it is so so sad and now I'm gonna go
ahead and I'm going to jump into yo ass
I know I'm going back and forth year but
I want to take my rapid brow products
right here I know a lot of you asked
about what I put on my brows at night
and like my eyelashes I will do the
cargo lash accelerator after because I
can only film on this camera for like
ten minutes
and then it cuts off but this is the
lash activator gel I know that it is now
officially like off the market which
totally sucks but that is what gives me
these nice lashes and I think that this
brow product is proud because a brow
product right here also really helps to
keep my brows nice and healthy
alright the next item that Tom and I did
use up is this little guy right here it
says squatty potty unicorn bold tropical
tropical actually I just used it up it
says you know spray the bowl before you
go and no one else will ever know it
actually smells really good
it's like a knockoff of the poop wordy
and I actually really liked him um here
we have the model luncher brows this was
a brow pencil at one side was like it
was like that when I stopped a Beverly
Hills brow definer it was like purple in
color was very strange I kind of worked
on me for some reason probably comes on
cool toned um but yeah I didn't really
think it was that amazing the spoolie
was really nice though because it was
super super tiny and then we have a one
a final product here and that is the hey
honey good morning honey silk facial
serum and Tom was the one who used this
and he wanted me to tell you guy said he
thought it was just okay so that is it
for this little video I hope you guys
enjoyed this I will probably go in with
my
after this and then I do like to go in
one more time with that Mario Badescu
spray this is not going to you know make
any of the cells too like acid or the
glycolic acid like inactive on your face
and it's a nice combo it's what I've
been doing all week so I hope you enjoy
this I'm really sorry to get that video
up earlier on but yeah I will see you
guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
