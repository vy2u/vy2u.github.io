you've been watching my channel for a
while you know I got through a lot of
 every single month um this is about

because I actually got back from a trip
I would say the second week of august so
technically this is really only two and
a half weeks worth but I still wanted to
share with you guys what I had used up
because I was worried if I put this in

start over flowing by the time we got to
the end of sep tember so anyway I'm
gonna show you guys my up my update I'm
gonna show you the guys my empties and
yes little health update i am currently

energy to go ahead and just like film a
video for you guys I can't you know I
can't guarantee that I'm going to feel
in the mood to sit down and answer
comments or even film for you guys
tomorrow I'm gonna do my best to get up
whatever kind of videos I can this week
for you but um yeah I just wanted to say
that I know that sometimes I promise
stuff for you guys and I really can't
promise anything when I'm in a flare-up
so I hope you guys can understand i will
be reading all the comments so i look
forward to hearing from you down below
but anyways let's go ahead and get into
this month at these alright so the first
item i used up over the rocket daily
resurfacing disc i use these as the
second parts of my makeup removal at
nighttime I love these will repurchase i
also used up this eddie on facial spray
i really enjoyed this a lot I got a
little dual pack at sephora really
really good product and very nice facial
mess I used up a bird's of these lip
balm I took the wrapper off of this one
this was the pomegranate really really
enjoyed that kept it in my flute case
would repurchase I used up the ol a
makeup remover wet cloths these are the
fragrance free version i really liked
these these are very comparable to these
simple wipes so if you like those ones
you should definitely check out these i
used to putting up baby white these are
just the Huggies unscented one's very
very good would repurchase we used up
thee let's see here fresh cotton ball
flowers in the odor eliminator
sent I have these in the beauty room
right now they smell really really good
I don't really think there's that much
of a difference between the regular wild
flowers and the odor-eliminating but I
still enjoyed them this is disgusting
Hey look exploded this is the thick and
full biotin and collagen shampoo from 0
DX II was so sticky this has vitamins v7
biotin hydrolyzed wheat protein and also
collagen I didn't really think it did
that much for my hair but it was nice
for um what did I use it for him hmm
lupus fog sorry guys um like used to
clean my makeup brushes it was very good
for that all right I did not go through
this whole entire thing but it went bad
i opened it up and i took a width the
other day and I was like holy that
smells horrible this is the Sephora
ethereal natural finish foundation they
are no longer selling this which really
bums me out because this is one of my
all-time favorite serum or water
foundations the shape that I have was
number 10 ivory if you can get your
pants on it before it goes out
definitely go ahead and pick it up I
really enjoyed that I used up the altima
seller waters these ulta micellar water
makeup removing clothing pads these are
a hydrating no-rinse formula with a low
and cucumber I did not enjoy be that all
I kind of enjoyed them but like I kind
of didn't I decided that I hated them
basically the actual pads did not stay
moist enough towards the end of the
little like on the end of the jar yeah
that's sorry guys the end of the jar
they did not stay moist enough so I
couldn't go in and kind of like white my
face down because they were just so dry
it out so they kind of made my face a
little red and irritated all right I did
not use this up at this did Gorgo bad
this is the laura ashley coconut lime a
body butter it used to smell like crazy
crazy coconut and lime and now it smells
like nothing and i don't think that's
right so i'm going to toss that I used
up the bath and body works deep
cleansing hand soap in Sweet Pea we had
this in the guest bathroom it is just a
blend of sweet pea petals share fascia
and luscious raspberry did enjoy that
would repurchase an item i would not be
purchased but also was so gross and
grimy you know what this message just
opened up and gotten everywhere this is
the only henriksen truth facial water
it's supposed to energize and high
rate the face I honestly just did not
like this I did not like it at all so I
would not repurchase this I used up a
ton of other lip balms let's see here
the lip smackers in the strawberry fanta
version another burt's bees in the mango
and another burt's bees in the
grapefruit sent really really love the
births fees and also this baby lips
right here actually went bad can you
guys see the difference there that is
how you know makeup is going bad if it
smells bad or if the color starts to
change so I'm gonna let go of that dr.
rescue moving on I've used up this
Sephora lavender foot mask it was
supposed to be refreshing and relaxing i
really enjoyed this a lot i would
definitely definitely repurchase
basically you just put it on your foot
like a sock you have like a little
twisty thing that goes around your ankle
you leave it on for about 20 minutes and
then rub in the excess and it was really
nice it really did actually make my feet
feel very soft alright i used up the CVS
pharmacy quality sleep melatonin these
are 10 milligram supplement you do not
have insomnia these are going to be too
much for you but if you do have insomnia
i would highly recommend checking this
one out it's just the compared to brand
really really good i used up the glow
hydro odd de maquillaje maquillage this
is the quick treat innovative microfiber
remove makeup with only water it
basically like the makeup eraser accept
it goes on to your index finger and then
you just rub off your eye makeup it
works really well I do like it it's
pretty darn good all right I used up the
ax makeup / cup dry shampoo with sea
buckthorn Barry I did like this quite a
bit but honestly it does leave a little
bit of a white cast so I don't know if I
would purchase a full-size I used up
this illamasqua precision Inc eyeliner
this is what it looks like I don't know
what I really use this for I don't use
liquid eyeliner like on the top but I
think they used it on the bottom and I
remember it being pretty darn good Tom
used up to the belief the true cream
aqua bomb you really really enjoyed this
and probably going to go ahead and get
him a full size of that so that he can
use that during the daytime I used up
the dr brandt microdermabrasion
age-defying exfoliator i did not think
this was anything special this is very
very pricey and honestly although it
does in microdrum your face it left a
very weird strange like cast like an
oily residue on my face
another baby lips that went bad as you
guys can see like the top is a different
color about us really gross that's
probably what a lot of my lip products
look like right now so I'm excited to
start my declutter series in October so
I can get rid of bad or get rid of those
that are bad I went through a line lash
purified eyelash serum and a rapid lash
it would consider be purchasing the
eyelash probably the rapid lashes well
you guys know that I do like eyelash
serums I do think it work and they just
I don't know if they work for me all
right I used up two of these Sephora I'm
asked the first one was the pomegranate
which is my all-time favorite this one
is anti fatigue and refreshing would
repurchase i also used up the Rose eye
mask which is um ultra moisturizing and
brightening loved this one as well
alright moving on I used up the back and
Body Works wild honeysuckle deep
cleansing hand soap actually we use this
in the kitchen it is a beautiful blend
of fresh honeysuckle freesia and white
woods love the scent during the spring
it's amazing that one and lilac blossom
are my favorite during the spring we
used up a bath and Bodyworks
odor-eliminating lavender and vanilla
wallflower plug this is what it looks
like again don't really know if the
odor-eliminating does anything
differently and my friend jessica said
to she was like are you sure it's not
that you're just getting used to the
smell because i was thinking that the
actual bulbs just weren't like putting
out any more sense but maybe it's just
that we're getting used to the scent and
I can't smell it anymore all right i am
going ahead and tossing this benefit
it's potent eye cream that this used to
work really well for me but now no
matter where i put it like near my eye
it just burns it burns like crazy even
if it's not like on my lower lashline it
burns so i'm gonna get rid of that I
used up a lancome events as genifique if
this is a beautiful beautiful day serum
i do like that wouldn't repurchase I
think this is what leaked I think this
is the bath and Bodyworks bubble bath
Amy carried away sense it's a beautiful
scent I don't know if it's something
that I would go out and repurchase um
again but it is a blend of lush
raspberries white jasmine and also
whipped vanilla so use that up and it
did smell quite good I used up the boots
mango extracts of body butter this was
amazing really really enjoyed this would
repurchase i'm using up the coconut one
right now oh my god but this one smells
really really good really liked that a
lot i used up to these sephora Rose clan
wipes these are for face and eyes you
get 25 wipes in here i am obsessed with
these these smell amazing they are my
new favorite cleansing wipes and you
guys will see a Paul soon I have no idea
when that will go up but I did another
did another Sephora haul I did place
another online order and I purchased
another one of these and also every
single other one that they offer which
is like the ginseng let's see they have
like coconut ones I'm just obsessed so
yeah really really enjoyed those
obviously have already repurchased I
used up the glam glow flash mod
brightening treatment which is a really
really beautiful face mask would
repurchase um this baby lips also went
bad I think yeah you can tell right away
it smells bad and of course you have
that little white cap thing at the top
there that is really gross you guys
should check on your baby lips if you
have had them for more than a year I
used up these nice flushable moist wipes
so I had to use these for removing
swatches and also you can use them in
the bathroom if you want to and let's
see here they last item that I have in
my bag is this make up forever aqua eyes
pencil this is what it looks like this
does not wear very well on my waterline
so I'm going to toss it and it did start
to like melt in my purse it's all funky
and gross living so anyway those are my
empties for the month I hope you guys
enjoyed this video sorry if I'm a little
distracted i call it my lupus fog but
