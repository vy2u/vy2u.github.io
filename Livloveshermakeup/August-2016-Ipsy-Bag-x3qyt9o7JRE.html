thank you so much for joining me i hope
you are all having a wonderful weekend
today's video or at least in this video
i will be unpacking my august 2016 if
speed bag for you guys and i do have
another video that will be going up
later today so if you're not interested
in this one hopefully will like the
other one anyway what happens is when i
pulled us out i see the full of card
here that says sugar highness and it
says live that fantasy pop the champagne
cans deck yourself in ring pops get
gorgeously glammed up and dip into
everyday decadence gone wild legal or it
says it C Auguste glam bag so this is
the little postcard that it came with
and the first two items that I see
actually don't even fit in this month's
pouch so the first two items that I got
are the secret garden olive oil on pool
a mask and also the camellia oil on pull
a mask so this is what they look like
these look like they are sheet masks
which I absolutely adore so this is the
secret garden camellia oil on pull a
mask and then this one is the olive oil
so you guys know I love to mass so I'm
super super excited this one is supposed
to be moisturizing soothing and lifting
and then the camellia one is supposed to
be moisturizing lifting and ultra
moisturizing so super excited for those
and the theme this month is actually
secret garden look at this pouch this is
by far my favorite if see bag I have
ever gotten look at this this is so so
so beautiful it's got like she looks
like a mermaid to me and just putting
makeup on someone's brushing your hair
it's super super cute i love that my
favorite one I've gotten so anyway let's
go ahead and take a look at what I got
alright so the first thing I see is a
little bent out of shape but that's okay
this is the Ciotti london um pink pot in
the shade spinning teacup so it looks
like it's a nice kind of light purple
and this is definitely a full size as
you guys can see I love purple nail
polish as you can probably tell i love
wearing the kind of like darker nail
polish during the summertime i'm not
really that into like pastel colors it
just doesn't look very flattering on my
skin tone but i feel like this is kind
of darker so hopefully that will work
i'm very excited to try that out and the
next item that i got in this Punk's bag
is the NYX born to glow liquid
illuminator it says it is a lightweight
liquid illuminator that gives the skin a
refreshed glow and beautiful highlight
the shape that I got is called gleam so
this is what it looks
like I feel like this will probably be
nice to mix into my foundations I don't
just from looking at it yeah this is
definitely not going to be probably a
highlight on me I do have quite fair
skin even though I am self sand right
now yes I am zelt and this is really
really pretty as you guys can see but it
is a little on the bronzy side so I feel
like this will be great for me during um
like well i was gonna say during the
summertime no girl even with your self
hand on your still pale this will be
great for me to just go ahead and mix
into my foundations to make them a
little darker and the next item that I
got is let's see here the radial or
rodial sorry smokey eye pen it is 1.2
grams which is a full-size the shade is
black this is what it looks like just a
regular eyeliner pencil hopefully it is
waterproof and it is one of those or
retractable ones which is nice so let's
go ahead and put a little bit on I love
a nice smoky eye pencil that I can put
onto my waterline it feels really really
nice and soft similar to like a kajal or
casual eye pencil like a coal kajal and
it actually kind of feels like it has
like a bit of like a gel consistency
which is kind of different so we'll see
how that wears on the waterline and then
the last item that i got in this month's
bag is the organic surge daily care
perfecting face polish and I'm always
really excited when ypsi sends me
skincare I think last month was the
first time I ever got like a mask from
them and I'm really happy that I got
more skincare this month because I love
skin care just as much as any other
beauty products so anyway it says
perfectly polished we've taken finely
ground all of stones and bound them into
a lotion made with moisturizing oils and
soothing herbal extracts creating a
gentle exfoliating skin treat to help
reveal your natural beauty so that is
what it looks like and that is a really
really nice size so anyways that is
everything that I got in my August FC
bag let me know down below what you got
in your August FC bag and I will see you
guys on my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
