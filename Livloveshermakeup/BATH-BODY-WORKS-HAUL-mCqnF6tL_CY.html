video is going to be a Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
haul this is probably the last like Bath
&amp;amp; Body Works fall haul but you guys will
see on my channel this year because they
are starting to release all of their
winter sense and you know how I feel
about bath and body works and basically
all of their sense so yes I did go ahead
and pick up a few winter sense in this
particular video and then the next one
that you see will probably be all winter
stuff so anyway let's go ahead and get
started i will start with you three with
candles and then we will do is the deep
cleansing hand soaps and then we will go
into the wallflowers so if the first
candle that i picked up is called
heirloom apple look at the packaging yes
yes yes if you guys didn't know I have
one kind of like this burning behind me
right now it actually has like orange
leaves and also red leaves and this time
is different because if you guys to look
closely you can see that they start to
have like a little bit of frost on them
because this is like a winter scent so
cute but anyway this is a blend of red
Cortland apple creamy sandalwood in
awesome marshmallow it's most amazing it
reminds me a lot of marshmallow fireside
with a little bit of sweetness to it so
if you like marshmallow start fri lit
marshmallow fireside if you probably
would like this candle it's just this
freestyle super excited to burn this and
i love this particular packaging so very
excited for that we did also go ahead
and pick up two of these cinnamon sugar
donut candles now if you guys watch my
empties videos you probably know Tom and
I burned through candles really quickly
so we do like to get doubles which is
why you see multiples of the same one
basically in my auntie's videos but this
one is like I said cinnamon sugar donut
this is a blend of crushed cinnamon
sugar crystals and homemade donuts this
is what the outer packaging looks like
and they have rose gold lids right now
which is adorable their lid game has
been so awesome they're fall candles had
like a beautiful little raised leaf on
them and their winter candles have
snowflakes on them and then these ones
right now have like a rose gold lip so
super super cute this smells amazing
just like a cinnamon sugar donut so we
got two of those which I'm very excited
about and then at the last two candles
that we got wore a black teary Merlot
which is more of like a i would say
winter fragrance I adored this fragrance
oh my god if you like a really really
sensual and like deep like very fragrant
in candle you would enjoy this quite a
bit
this is a mixture of dark cherry black
raspberry and scrumptious Merlot and
again has the rose gold lid and this is
what the packaging looks like so we did
pick up two of those as well so those
are all five candles that we picked up
but let me show you guys the deep
cleansing hand soaps because again if
you watched our empties videos or by of
these videos you know that we go through
a lot of soap as well a lot of people
were wondering if like I think someone
asked last time they were like do one of
you work at home neither of us work at
home I think it's mostly because Tom's a
doctor he constantly washes his hands so
I'm pretty sure that's how we go through
soap so quickly but anyway the first
only picked up with black cherry Merlot
in the deep cleansing hand soap
formulation and this is how i actually
discovered the scent black cherry merlot
was through a deep cleansing hand soap i
do think it smells better in the deep
cleansing hansel formulation than in d3
wick candle variation I don't know why
it just does to me but yeah this is just
a blend of dark cherry black raspberry
and then scrumptious Merlot so we got
that one we also picked up let's see
here winter candy apple I always get
this during the wintertime it's a really
nice like Bryce kind of fragrance it is
part of their holiday traditions and
this is a festive blend of red apple
evergreen wreath and brown sugar cider
so that is what it looks like and it
really does smell good it smells really
really fresh you would think that this
would smell a little more of like warm
scented or whatever but actually smells
really really fresh and then we also got
a French lavender and I love the French
lavender scent from bath and body works
especially in the kitchen we have two
little we have like a little what is it
leave like a little trade that holds two
deep cleansing and soaps from
simplehuman Anna it just fits these
perfectly so we always have two of these
in the kitchen and I really like the
French lavender scent because have a
little bit of warmth to it um it says it
is a soothing blend a fresh lavender
with hints of amber so yeah it smells
really good if you're one of those
people that doesn't like just
straight-up lavender on its own this one
is really nice because it does have a
little bit of a mixture going on there
and then the last one that we picked up
was twisted peppermint and twisted
peppermint is one of those sends that I
go back and forth on every single year I
can't decide if I love it or if I hate
it it is a blend of a twisted peppermint
with I think yeah vanilla buttercream so
sweet peppermints sugared snow and
vanilla buttercream shugarts now
whatever that means um
basically what I smell is peppermint and
vanilla and sometimes that fragrance
gives me a headache like when I happen
in three wit Campbell form it gives me a
headache but i really like it in soap
form and I'm a huge fan of peppermint so
we picked it up in deep cleansing hand
so formulation and we shall see if this
gives me a headache or not hopefully it
won't and then we also did pick up some
wallflowers because we love our well
flowers so the first little duo that we
got here is marshmallow fireside I love
marshmallow fireside this time of year
but I do think that the three-week
handle variation I find it very very
weak does anybody else find it super
weak I feel like the actual wicks never
burned properly I think it is from white
burn the white part version is the one I
usually pick up so hopefully they come
out with a different version but I just
find like it it doesn't have any sort of
sent through even when you smell it cold
it doesn't smell very strong so i don't
really like it in three wood candle form
but i do love it in the wallflower form
so we will have these in the living room
and then i got some more of the pumpkin
pecan wallflowers this is what they look
like obviously the wrong tires i just
thought that but this is pumpkin pecan
waffles of wildflowers and this is just
a little 20 pack this is for the beauty
room I love the scent it smells
absolutely absolutely amazing and then I
did pick up one a little single and this
is for at the like the hallway when you
walk in we like to have a Wallflower
there and this is the sense that
everybody has been talking about right
now this is called a thousand wishes i
actually have never smelled this before
and it says it is a let's take your
blend of sparkling champagne crystal
peonies which was my favorite flower and
almond creme which I really love the
scent of almond and like amaretti
everything like that so I think that I
will enjoy this I know that they have
three lit candle variation of this right
now and they have been like promoting
this fragrance a lot right now so I'm
excited to try that out so anyway and
that is everything that we picked up
from Bath and Body Works I hope you guys
enjoyed this little haul and I will see
you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
