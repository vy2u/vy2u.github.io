you can tell from the title of this
video we are doing battle of the lip
Isles hold on have a alarm going off
there anyway up like I said we are doing
battle of the lip oils and I was
originally going to be posting a holiday
review for you guys tonight a few things
got moved around YouTube wise and also
work wise so I will actually be posting
three holiday reviews for you guys
tomorrow so hopefully that will make up
for the lack of holiday reviews tonight
um anyway like I said today's video is
going to be battle of the lip oils I
have a few different brands here to
share with you guys the first one we're
going to be talking about is the Clarins
instant light lip comfort oil we will
also be talking about the physician
formula physicians formulas Argan wear
lip oils we're gonna be talking about
the Lancome juicy shaker and the YSL the
leptin tin oil I'm gonna give you guys a
quick little rundown on all the products
and then I am going to tell you which
are my top two so anyway let's go ahead
and get started we're going to start
with the Lancome juicy shaker this is
what the packaging looks like I
purchased the shade cheery Symphony 151
and here is the swatch on the back of my
hand it is really beautiful very nice
little wash of color but I will say this
is definitely not one of my favorite lip
oils because the wear time on this is
incredibly poor now these are lip oils
and I love this lip oil trend I love
comfortable lip products but I will say
lip oils don't last
obviously as long as say a matte
lipstick or a liquid lipstick but they
are very comfortable and they just give
a nice wash of color to the lips and I
feel like this does that however you do
have to apply this literally every
twenty to thirty minutes so it's one of
those products that I personally would
not go and purchase a another one of
these but I will go ahead and try and
use this up this is what the packaging
looks like it's adorable is like a
little shaker and it does smell good it
tastes good and I do think that the
packaging is adorable look at the little
spongy applicator there it's just so
cute but I think that a lot of people
were drawn to this because of how cute
the packaging is but I will say as far
as like where time is concerned this is
definitely the weakest out of the bunch
alright moving on the next one we're
going to talk about is from Clarins this
is the instant like lip comfort oil in
the shade 0-2
raspberry it's a beautiful kind of just
bitten raspberry kind of color does that
make sense just
this is what the applicator looks like
again a nice big kind of fluffy wand
sort of like the Lancome juicy shaker
and this one is definitely a lot less
pigmented so if you are looking for a
little more pigment I would go with the
Lancome but this is what the Clarins one
looks like you guys can see it truly is
a very light wash of color it will start
to darken up but the formulation on this
is a lot thicker than the Lancome the
Lancome is very very thin and very very
oily which is why you do need to go
ahead and shake it up so that you get
the pigment paired together with the oil
and this one is just a lot thicker it's
got a beautiful consistency I feel like
it moisturizes very very well and the
wear time on this is really good you
guys I would say an hour to two hours
which is amazing for a lip oil so I
really like the formulation on this
again you guys can see it starting to
darken up a little bit they do offer I
believe three different shades the
Lancome juicy shaker's they have a
bajillion shades out of this but they
offer three shades of this I believe
honey is kind of like a clear nudie
color this one is the middle shade and
then they also have a darker berry color
and I am interested in going ahead and
purchasing the other ones alright moving
on next we're going to talk about the
Physicians Formula Argan wear lip Isles
this is the packaging that they come in
I think the packaging is so cute I
actually think it's cuter than the
Lancome juicy shaker they're really
really cute this is what I look like
this one is called gold and this one is
basically just a clear lip oil I do like
the applicator and these are very very
moisturizing on the lips so there is the
consistency of the gold one as you guys
can see it's definitely kind of thick
sort of like the Clarins one like I said
the Lancome is definitely the one that
has the thinnest formulation to it but I
like these a lot they smell good they
taste really good and I do find that
they most rise my lips quite well
however the wear time on these I would
say is about 45 minutes tops so you do
need to go ahead and reapply these but
if you are looking for a good option
from the drugstore I definitely think
these are worth um I'm just going to say
worth the hype but definitely worth
looking into I want to say so here is
the pink one if you guys are curious so
there's the pink and there is the gold
shade like I said they do have a little
more of a thicker formulation not as
thick as the Clarins
but they are still quite thick and the
smell is really nice you know if you've
smelled some of the Physicians Formula
orchid wear products you probably know
the scent
think about it can be slightly
overpowering so if you are not into that
and I would stay away from these but
overall if you are looking for a good
lip oil at the drugstore I think these
are fantastic and also I want to say I
have heard really really good things
about the Milani lip oils I personally
have not tried those but I've heard
really good things about them as well so
definitely go ahead if you have never
tried out like the lip oil trend go
ahead and start at the drugstore see if
you're into it see if you like the way
that they feel on the lips and if you
like that then I would definitely
recommend going and looking at some of
the higher-end options like the
clearance and the final one I want to
talk about is from YSL this is the Vil
up tint in oil D shade I have is cherry
my Shelly this is what the outer
packaging looks like so beautiful
absolutely amazing they smell so good
this particular one smells like
watermelon and the actual applicator is
super super cute you have a nice curved
tip here and then it does have like a
little hole in the middle so that you
really can I don't really know what the
hole is for but anyway I feel like it's
nice because you have this little pointy
tip and then you have the flat surface
as well and this is one of those
products kind of like the Clarins where
it does start to darken up the longer
it's been on your skin but can you guys
see that color it is perfect it's the
perfect wash of like a powdery pink it's
super moisturizing not sticky or tacky
at all and I will say none of these are
super super sticky or tacky the one that
I think has the thickest formulation is
definitely the Clarins but for the most
part I don't find any of these lip boils
to be sticky or tacky and I know that
sounds weird because it's like okay
their lip oils they shouldn't be sticky
or tacky but there are a few
formulations that I find that can be
stickier than others I had another one
that I actually decluttered already a
caramel or what brand is from it was a
high-end brand it was a libel and it was
so incredibly tacky I should have kept
it for this video but I cannot remember
what it was you guys if I remember I'll
leave it in the description bar
but anyway so you can see the YSL color
is really really gorgeous
it definitely has more of a glossy
finish and then once the glossy finish
actually wears off this is the only one
that actually leaves a stain on your lip
so if you want a really long wearing
product that does kind of heat up on
your lips and gives a beautiful wash of
color and then leaves a stain I would
highly recommend this one so let me go
ahead and share with you guys my top two
picks out of all four definitely the
Clarins instant light lip comfort oil
like I said I really do like the shade
of this and I love how long wearing it
is this one is incredibly incredibly
long wearing I love the way that it
makes my lips feel it's very very thick
but at the same time it stays on a long
time and I feel like the moisturization
is there and it's on point so that is
definitely the first favorite and then
the second favorite are the YSL the love
Tintin oils I do plan on getting the
whole collection of this during the vib
sale when they are 20% off because these
are normally I believe $32 a piece they
do have quite a nice shaped selection
although the Clarins only have three
different shades I hope that they will
come out with more because I think these
are fantastic lip oils the third place
would definitely have to be the
Physicians Formula lip oils and then I
would say my least favorite is the
Lancome juicy shaker's so anyway those
are kind of my little reviews and
thoughts and swatches on these
particular lip oils I hope you guys
enjoyed this video let me know down
below what your favorite lip oil is and
I will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
