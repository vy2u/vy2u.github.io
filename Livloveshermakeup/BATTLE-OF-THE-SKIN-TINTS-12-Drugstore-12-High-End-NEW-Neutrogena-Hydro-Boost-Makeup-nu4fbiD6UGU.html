if my voice sounds a little raspy I am
pre filming this for you guys early in
the morning but I am here to do a battle
of the skin pins today for you guys I'm
going to do a five hour wear test on
these two babies right here so on the
right side of my face I'm going to be
applying the hourglass illusion
hyaluronic skin King indie shade vanilla
and then on the left side of my face I
will be applying the Neutrogena Hydra
growth hydrating tint in the shade
classic ivory so these are supposed to
be kind of comparable products the
Neutrogena will set you back $14.99 for
one fluid ounce there are ten different
shades to choose from and I did actually
go ahead and out to pick up the matching
concealer the concealer will set you
back $12.99 and there are five different
shades to choose from I chose the shade
fair was supposed to be the lightest and
then the hourglass will set you back $56
which is quite expensive there are 12
different shades to choose from like I
said I am wearing the shade vanilla and
then I'm going to pair that together
with me towards rainforests of bc aqua
sealer if you didn't know do you have 12
different shades of this and this does
retail for 26 so we're basically going
to be doing an expensive side of the
base and kinda be more cheap side up say
see what wears better throughout the day
I wanted to a 5 hour wear test instead
of an 8 hour wear test because honestly
guys I do find that skin can start to
eat away at my face pretty quickly not
eat away at my face basically eat off of
my face pretty darn quickly so what
happens is I'll be wearing them and then
I noticed that they do start to break up
throughout the day just because they
don't have the longevity as like a
typical foundation would have if that
makes sense so anyway let's go ahead and
jump right into it we're going to apply
these I will be applying a primer all
over my face the Bobbi Brown
vitamin-enriched face face and then on
each side of my face I have a BM sponge
here from Ulta that I will be going
ahead and applying the products with if
you have a powder here to go in with if
I feel like I want to set them in and
yeah that's pretty much it if you didn't
know Neutrogena does tests on animals
however hours left not test on animals
they are crazy free brand so I just
wanted to put that out there let me show
you guys the time before we get into
this it is currently 8:24 a.m. and this
is a february 8th so you guys are not
seeing this video i'm doing a bunch of
pretty shortly before my trip so you're
not actually seeing this video for
probably a week and a half
it is currently 824 so let me zoom you
guys in and we shall get started I am
going to jump into the Bobbi Brown
vitamin-enriched face base and I'm going
to be taking this BH Cosmetics
foundation brush and I'm just going to
scoop in there and apply this on to you
at my face I noticed that I've been
really really bad with pulling on my
skin every single time I use this on
camera so I'm just going to go ahead and
start applying it with a brush probably
a little more sanitary as well instead
of dipping my actual fingers in there so
I will be going ahead and applying this
all over my face as well as around my
eye area when I do test out a foundation
for the first time I like to see how it
wears around my eye area the one that is
going to be a true first impressions is
be Neutrogena but the other one the
hourglass and obviously be tartrate for
some bc I haven't used it before so
we're going to see if they are
comparable I know a lot of you have been
asking if they are duped and hopefully
this will answer that particular
question so anyway just applying this
primer all over my face and yeah let's
go ahead and jump right into it I am
going to start with the side that I
already know a little bit about and that
use the hyaluronic skin pin from
hourglass so this is what it looks like
like I said the shade I wear is called
vanilla so I'm just going to take
probably about this size amount on it my
finger less is more with this product as
you find it that I get a little oily if
I use too much so I am just going to go
ahead and apply dots all over my face
and I do find with skin tints less is
more because they do tend to be a little
more hydrating and although my skin is a
little more dry this time of year
I still get oily in my t-zone size to be
careful all right not taking evening up
sponge from Ulta I am just going to go
ahead and blend that in to my skin and I
do like it this particular skin tint
I think it's nice but I mean seriously
like $54 is super super pricey so I
don't blame you guys for wanting it to
find a dupe for it so we shall see how
the Neutrogena
compares I do notice right away that the
Neutrogena well first of all I saw on
the website that the actual applicator
looks very similar to the clinic beyond
perfecting foundation so it has like
that little brush thing but also it
doesn't look like the shade is going to
be a little more yellow tone
I feel like this shade vanilla does
match me quite well it does start to
oxidize a little bit but for the most
part it matches me quite well so there
is one layer of the hourglass hyaluronic
skin pin but I'm just going to take a
little more and I am going to build up
on the areas where I need a little bit
of extra coverage like around my eyes
and also where I have some acne scarring
again going to just blend that in as you
go you can see this does have a lot more
of a moosie texture to it not a typical
kind of tint but it does get pretty damn
good coverage I would say it gives about
like you know medium coverage which is a
lot for a skin tint but I do still find
that it doesn't wear incredibly well on
my face any time I am wearing like a
skin tint I'm usually only wearing it
for I would say probably about you know
four to five hours I like to wear it on
date night and also just on days where
I'm around the house and I know I won't
be doing anything so anyway that is what
it is looking like so far let's go ahead
and apply our concealer as well so I'm
just going to spot conceal any area that
I need to cover again this is the terms
of rain for so BC aqua sealer I thought
it would be is the closest thing to the
Neutrogena hydro boost concealer since
it is water light or water weight I
guess I should say water we've got it so
early in the morning guys it's super
super light on the skin and I thought it
would be similar so just blending that
in and then we will jump over to the
other side and I do like to set in this
particular skin tint because it does
have that thicker sort of consistency to
it and I do notice it starts to wear off
of the face a little quicker and I have
been loving setting hydrating tints or
like tinted moisturizers in with the Kat
Von D's locket setting powder which you
guys know I was thinking about
decluttering because I just didn't like
it that much but it looks amazing with
lighter foundations alright so there is
the hourglass hyaluronic skin tint if
you don't concede so this item eight
dates has done it now let's go ahead and
do in your Judea so here is the
Neutrogena this will be a true first
impressions I've already shade classic
ivory and apparently an SMS hyaluronic
acid in it and this is what the
applicator looks like very similar like
I said to the Clinique could be on it
perfecting so I'm just going to go ahead
and start applying this
two of my space it actually looked
really similar in consistency could be
hourglass actually which is funny all
these kids are like more full coverage
nowadays so that's kind of interesting
so I am just kind of spotting that on
there I don't know how much coverage
this is going to get so I'm just going
to apply a nice amount so that's even on
each side and then we will blend that in
so taking a new advance fund I'm just
going to blend that into my skin it
looks really really yellow tones no idea
you guys can see that but my goodness
okay like traveling everywhere I'm back
in size out all right
okay so right away with one layer I can
see it is very very yellow toned it is
not masking me the way to hourglass
matches me and it definitely is not
giving me the coverage is that hourglass
sees me but again the covers on the
hourglass is kind of different for a
skin tint you know it basically is like
almost like a foundation so let's go
ahead and build up the side with the
Neutrogena did you see how yellow toned
it is though a little nervous just a
little nervous we shall see let's go
ahead and keep building that up so we
can get some even coverage so just
dotting it on again to the side of my
face see super yellow tone I hate that
about Neutrogena foundations all of them
are super super yellow tone which is
great if you have a warm undertone but
for someone who has a cool undertone
like I do it is that it's not helpful
alright so there is about two layers
let's go ahead and blend back in now and
see if it makes a difference well it
looks pretty buildable which is good I
always do like when something has a
little bit of buildable coverage just so
that you can put a few layers on there's
no line between the two all right so
that actually gave a decent coverage it
definitely does not look nearly as
flawless at the hourglass side I don't
know if you guys can tell
here is the hourglass and then here is
the Neutrogena I don't know how much
showing up on camera but this one just
looks it looks a lot more glowy to me
but also very very yellow tones like
crazy yellow toned actually alright so I
think that's all I'm going to do as far
as building is concerned let's just
leave it at that that looks pretty good
to me way too yellow tone for me was a
way to atone for me but hopefully when
we set it in with powder which I think
I'm going to want to do since it does
look kind of shiny hopefully when we set
it in with powder it will lighten it up
a little bit alright now let's go into
the concealer like I should I like I
said I said I just got the lightest
shade so let's see you can do any sort
of concealing so that is what it is
looking like so far what do you guys
think oh my god it's all holy
alright let's go ahead and try this on
so here is the hydrating concealer again
looks super super yellow alright I'm
just going to build it up in areas that
and you have a little extra to cover and
then underneath the eyes as well okay
does not look like it's going to be like
a full coverage concealer which is good
because the other one was not to eat
they're only laying forcibly see by
looking bad I like that for a stick
concealer it actually looks pretty damn
good on the skin okay if I cover my eyes
I thought was that went on nicely but
I'm not sure about this content this is
so much so so yellow tones goodness
gracious
people do have SPF though which is great
so alright so you guys this is what
everything is looking like with two
layers of concealer on each side so on
this side is the hourglass hyaluronic
skin tint and then on this side is a
Neutrogena hydro boost definitely a lot
more yellow toned over here but I think
they both look pretty damn good now as
they're kind of setting in so let's go
ahead and put that it was powder just
because I am slightly worried they
seemed a little bit on the moist side
for me so I will be taking me locket
translucent powder and I'm just going to
take this fluffy Beach cosmetics brush I
just ate pizza bug and we're just going
to put a little bit on
do you notice that with this particular
powder it looks really nice when you're
rained like what light kind of like kind
of foundation so I'm just kind of
dusting at that on lightly it is
probably going everywhere because it is
a loose powder but we shall see if this
will help with the longevity and like I
said we're going to do a 5 hour wear
test just because I do feel like skin
tints are not meant to be on the skin as
long as they typical foundation is
that's just what I get out of it but you
know you do you whatever you feel
comfortable with you do you alright so
make sure everything is set in and it
definitely kind of changed to be
finished now looks just a little more
matte on each side but color wise
actually looks a little better now so
it's starting to kind of blend in let's
hope that neither of these oxidize too
much I already know the hourglass does
below of it so we'll see about that but
yeah all right let me do any rate then
I'll show you what everything looks like
so over here is the hourglass hyaluronic
skin continue shade vanilla and over
here is the Neutrogena hydro boost
hydrating tint initiate classic favori
so we shall see how this wears
throughout the day and we shall see if
they already do it for each other thanks
so much for joining me guys and I will
see you in five hours you're probably
gonna CD videos back to back because
this is pretty silly but yes definitely
go click on that video if you would like
to see how this were throughout the date
