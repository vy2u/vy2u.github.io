welcome back to my channel a few things
before we get into it these are swatches
on my hands okay just so we know and if
you're wondering what the is going
on with my eyelashes it looks like I
might be playing in a wedding tonight
now that is a little complicated because
I was supposed to do a February 2018
livestream basically showing you my
empties for the month so I'm not quite
sure if that is still going to happen
I'm sorry you guys work always comes
first keep you guys updated either he
will see me live at 6 p.m. for empties
or you will knocked and I will keep you
updated in the community tab section on
YouTube so anyway today's video is going
to be a channel of recommendation video
I'm very excited I have some new
channels of beauty channels that I have
recently been really really into and I
thought I would share them with you guys
this is in no particular order let's go
ahead and jump right into it number one
Matilda she is a crazy fast growing a
channel and she's super unique and
refreshing because we've never seen her
we don't know what she looks like all of
her videos are filmed behind the camera
so how I would do you know like I shot
my snapchat video or how I would do a
declutter video that's how she films her
vlogs that's how she films her reviews
and that's how she films literally her
hauls everything and it's hella
refreshing not seen a person and I know
that sounds really really strange but I
feel like the beauty community can be
very very superficial so the content is
super super fresh and her reviews are
spot-on so I'm gonna go ahead and insert
a clip of her latest video for the Fenty
Beauty line right here so that you guys
can see if you are interested in
checking out her channel hello there
time for a mini Fenty beauty brand
review I was only drawn to a few pieces
from this much-hyped range but I thought
I'd put them together and talk about
them in one go for anyone else
interested in grabbing a bit of the
latest and greatest celeb brand Breanna
burst onto the beauty scene in September
2017 with Fenty Beauty her real profane
name is Robyn Fenty for those who don't
know and it seems to have been going
from strength to strength I feel like
they're really faceted packaging with
its wide octagonal compacts and
Honeycomb magnetic six have already
become pretty iconic unfortunately I'm
not someone who wears foundation so I
skip past that and went for the fun
colorful things I have two of the
kilowatt freestyle highlighters I went
for the full-size ginger binge and
Moscow Mule and hustla baby which is a
tiny little one that was sold in a mini
duo along with her lip gloss up next we
have Elle she was around 15,000
subscribers she's hella unique her
videos are unique her style is unique
her makeup is unique
I love unique people it really really
gets me excited because she's new she's
fresh she's not doing what other people
are doing I get bored very very easily
watching channels and I never did bored
with her so she does a lot of
anti-consumerism sort of videos as well
as project panning that video so if you
are very much interested in that I think
you're gonna love her channel but she
also talks a little bit about the BD
community she's not overly opinionated
like I am but again a lot of people like
that they like when someone's a
level-headed and she's really really
sweet so I'll go ahead and insert a
little clip here of her video all about
why is she unsubscribes from Beauty
Channel so anyway I've identified five
reasons why I personally unsubscribe
people I'm not talking about people who
I didn't subscribe to at all but people
who I did subscribe to and then
something made me hit that on the
subscribe button and it might not be
immediately sometimes you hope that
things are going to change or get better
and hold on to them in your subscription
list and then eventually when you do a
purge I've done some recently where you
go through your list and realize I know
I'm not watching this person anymore of
this person so my palette looked like
during my last update and this is what
my palette looks like now completely
empty I am never going to pan Mac
eyeshadows intentionally ever again
alright guys up next we have Georgia
Harris I love Georgia she is the
balanced beauty guru I feel like she is
not overly opinionated but she really
really like aways things evenly she
never gets too hot-headed but she also
doesn't let things slip through the
cracks so she feels like she needs to
say something she will say something she
is the epitome of a really really chill
cool beauty guru I feel like all of us
want to aspire to be a little bit like
that where we're not over-the-top like
me screaming at the camera all by
myself in this room but also not caring
enough to talk about certain topics and
issues she really does talk about things
in such a level-headed way and I
absolutely love it she does a lot of
deep potting a video see you guys and
she's bumpity potting so if you
want to learn how to do that
if you want to see how she would
reorganize palettes things like that I
will go ahead and I will insert a clip
of her rearranging the Kat Von D Saint
and sinner palette and then I'm also
going to go ahead and insert a clip of
her so you can see her face and all that
kind of stuff cos she's adorable
excited to use this I like the layout I
did one item out of the collection I
used to consider myself kind of like a
completionist and I had to get the
entire collection because it was limited
edition and I had to get it all and it
had to be like all together you know
ever all the brought all the family all
the family had to be together in the
collection so it's kind of like a
general thing that I regret doing is
buying entire collections when I only
wanted like one lipstick or one
eyeshadow palette I feel like I've
gotten a lot better and not doing that
and I'm talking about that so that's you
know that isn't too bad for regrets but
it you know what is something that I
don't go save some money if I didn't
always buy the entire collection of
stuff when I didn't want everything in
it I recommend you guys a check out I
will have all of their channels linked
down below thank you so much for joining
me and I'll see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
