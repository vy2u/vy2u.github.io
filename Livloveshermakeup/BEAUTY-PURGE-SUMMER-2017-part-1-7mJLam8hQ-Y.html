with my hair Oh welcome back to my
channel today's video is going to be
part one of a beauty purge now a beauty
purge for me is not me sitting on camera
G cluttering with you guys it's
basically the products that I already
chose I want to declutter I'm coming on
camera to share with you guys why I'm
decluttering that but now if you didn't
know I am moving to Arizona today as you
guys are watching this so tomorrow's
video will be part 2 of this beauty
purge but I did want to let you guys
know first of all I'm not sitting on
camera decluttering with you I've
already chosen the items and I don't
want to travel with and second of all
tomorrow's video will be the last video
that you guys will see for me for
probably about a week just because we're
moving down to Arizona gotta get settled
in the new place all that kind of stuff
but then I will be back to do more anti
hauls I want to do my consistent versus
unreliable makeup brands video for the
month I have limited edition my ass all
these great videos planned out for you
guys so anyway Beauty purge what I mean
by that is basically and there are
deluxe sized samples there are samples
there are haircare products there are
skincare products there are makeup
products that just sit in my collection
and I do not want to pack these I do not
want to take them with me on this trip
down so yeah I'm just gonna let go of
them and I thought it would be fun to
share with you guys what I'm letting go
of so let's go ahead and jump right into
it we are going to start with this guy
right here this is a little body spray
or fragrance mist it is from I Kona Lee
this is called the body fragrance in
playful lychee it smells amazing but I
just never ever ever reach for this so
I'm going to go ahead and let that go I
also have this little guy right here
from Clairol this is called these shine
a happy natural instincts clear shine
treatment for your hair I used to use
these all the time but when obviously I
didn't have a bunch of stuff going on
with my scalp if you didn't know I
recently had scalp surgery I do have
lupus I have some issues with scarring
on the back of my scalp from a treatment
that I was doing this year for my lupus
or this past year but yeah basically
this is a really really nice a treatment
that you put in your hair and then you
wash it out my friend Rochelle has
gorgeous red hair and I thought I would
send this four way so that she could use
it it really does keep your hair nice
and shiny for like two or three weeks
which is awesome so I'm going to go
ahead and let go of that next I do have
this little tart high-performance
naturals this is just a little mini of
thee let's see here smooth operator
Amazonian clay finishing powder never
reach for this
I have probably three or four of these
in my collection already so I'm just
going to go ahead and let go of that I
also have a full-size turn to blush that
I'm going to let go of
I never reach for this particular shade
it's called pampered it's one of the
Amazonian clay 12-hour blushes it's a
beautiful peachy color but I have so
many like this in my collection so like
I said gonna go ahead and let go of that
next I have this little pharmacy skin do
hydrating essence it's a mist and
setting spray it does have echinacea
greenery or whatever in it and I find
this leaves my skin very very oily kind
of like the tatcha luminous dewy skin
mess so I'm not really a fan I know I'm
probably gonna dry out when I go to
Arizona so maybe I'll try the other one
that I do have in my collection I'll go
ahead and try that one out again but
yeah I had two or three of these and I
just didn't feel the need to have all
three so I'm gonna let that go I have a
holographic gloss here called the glossy
holic holographic 3d lipgloss from hard
candy it's called over the rainbow it's
super super pretty but it's also super
super sticky so I'm gonna go ahead and
let that go I have some matte lip colors
here if you guys didn't know I really
don't wear a lot of matte lip colors
anymore or liquid lipsticks not because
I don't like them but they just don't
feel comfortable on my lips anymore I'm
just all about comfort right now so I'm
gonna let go of my ELF matte lip colors
which I really loved these were
absolutely gorgeous the first shade I
have here is called natural I also have
the shade of praline which was my
favorite and rich red and then here I
have the wet and wild velvet matte lip
color in the shade hickory-smoked so all
of these were just in crayon of formula
they're really really beautiful again go
to declutter these too my friend because
they know she'll get use out of them
super super nice they have a nice taste
to them very very long wearing did like
those a lot but they're just a little
too uncomfortable for me so I'm gonna
let them go I do have a nail polish here
that I haven't even taken out from
trust-fund Beauty it's like a beautiful
kind of aquamarine color and I'm just
not going to use this I don't wear nail
polish enough because I am a flutist and
usually on stage I don't like to wear
nail polish because it is a little
distracting so I'm going to go ahead and
let go of that next I do have this elf
tonot correcting a powder I know it's
not cool don't worry everybody would be
like what elf tone correcting powder and
cool no this is actually the shimmer
version
I just find I really don't get a lot of
use out of this you guys and I think it
would be better for someone who does
have really dry skin like my friend
Rochelle so I'm going to go ahead and
let go of that next we do have these
icono and nail polishes these are like
little press-on nail art kind of things
again don't do much with my nails I'm
just not into it I also really really
hope I also really really don't like the
look of fake nails I just think it looks
really fake in my opinion if you love
fake nails that's great it's just not my
style so these are totally like not
really up my alley they're really cute
and I'm sure they would look nice
because you can kind of shape them into
your actual nail but again I don't have
pretty enough nails for this we're going
to go ahead and let that go I have a BH
Cosmetics palette right here this is the
wild child baked eyeshadow palette one
of the pans actually fell out I used to
get a lot of use out of this palette I
think it's beautiful
I'm going to keep the other one that I
have which is called the wild and free
or wild child or something like that but
this is what this one looks like these
are actually quite nice when you do foil
them I like to like smoke it out on the
lower lash line but I just have so many
colors like this I just don't need it
that palette so I'm gonna go ahead and
let that go next I do have the case of
for the tarte a brush set that came out
this holiday season I hate the pattern
on here it's way too groovy for me you
know what I mean like way too 70s it
does come with like a little bit of a
magnetic thing over here if you want to
put in a few of magnetic shadows and
then your brush is here I find it very
clunky and big and I hate the pattern so
I'm going to go ahead and let go of that
next I do have a supplement this is
called the Cerro vital HGH this is human
growth hormone I actually got this on
the ulta.com website when it was on sale
for like $118 yeah I purchased it for
like $118 basically just comes in these
little packs like this you're supposed
to take four of these a day like I said
I was on like a lupus trial and I was
not allowed to be taking extra
supplements and I'm still not really
allowed to unless it's like homeopathic
stuff for the next three months so I
will not be taking these and I thought I
would go ahead and give them to someone
else it says right here growth hormone
has been associated with wrinkle
reduction decrease the body fat increase
the lean muscle mass stronger bones
improve mood heightened sex drive and
making users look and feel decades not
years younger so well I don't know it
kind of sounds like a miracle drug but
again
not really into that because they just
can't take it currently alright next I
have a product that was sent to me for
PR from Aussie a while back before I
went cruelty free and this is the total
miracle 17:1 conditioner I never reached
for it my friend Rachelle sometimes
doesn't use conditioner in her hair
yes Rachelle um is she literally washes
her hair but she's like should I use
conditioner and like what did you just
say so I thought I'd go ahead and send
this four way it really smells good but
again right now with my scalp I have to
use the special kind of like
prescription-grade stuff on my actual
scalp next I do have the little TLC from
boost glycolic a night serum from drunk
elephant I feel like my knit + fab serum
does the same exact thing so can I go
ahead and let that go
so more haircare products I just can't
use on my scalp the caviar CC cream
extra hold ten-in-one this basically
just makes your hair a lot thicker and
it's really really nice to kind of style
it I also have the living proof perfect
hair day 5 in one styling treatment
again just can't use this stuff on my
hair currently so I got my friend
Rochelle could get use out of that
here is the scent and shiny coconut oil
it is not a hundred percent pure or
cold-pressed or refined or anything like
that so I'm going to go ahead and let go
of that I prefer my new tiba organic
coconut oil next I do have a lip palette
here from a Bobbi Brown I thought my
friend Rochelle would love this it is
the Bobbi Brown University lip palette
absolutely stunning but I have to say I
much prefer my Anastasia Beverly Hills
lip palette and I definitely prefer my
Urban Decay lip palettes over this so
I'm gonna go ahead and let it go and
this is what it looks like really really
gorgeous colors in here they are like a
lipstick pressed into a pan at this was
a limited edition but I thought she
would like that because those are her
kind of colors next we have the phyto
paris what is this called repairing
thermal protectant spray for weakened
damaged hair so I just thought maybe
someone could try this out again it
can't use this in my hair currently it's
really sad but I'm just I have a lot of
stuff going on in the back of my scalp
alright next we do have the bubble and
bumble the bubble of Bumble and Bumble
and Bumble grooming creme again can't
really use this currently I used to
though that was a really nice product it
gave a lot of volume and thickness to
the hair the caviar Repair multivitamin
heat protectant spray another really
nice one it smells really good but can't
use it currently some more Bumble and
Bumble products this is the all style
blow dry cream I never he
style my hair anyway so I'm going to go
ahead and let that go the thickening
hairspray from bumble and bumble this
one is really really good you can see I
have used probably about half of this
little tube actually have a full-size of
this as well but I'm going to go ahead
and let go of this little one see if my
friend Rochelle likes that I do have a
hydrating a facial mascara that just
doesn't work for my skin this is the
boots number seven beautiful skin
hydration mask for dry or very dry skin
it says it gives a skin and intensive
boost of moisture and it is
hypoallergenic you can see I've used
about that much and I got this probably
two or three years ago the expiration is
telled 2018 which is crazy for a skin
care product but yeah this really
doesn't work for me I don't have the
driest of skin I'm sure I will when I
move down to Arizona but I thought to
Rochelle would get more use out of this
and then I begin to send this one to my
friend uh Who am I gonna send this to
should I send this to Haley you know
what no I'm gonna send the suggest this
is the Sebastian style bird a multi
benefit hair spray she does curl her
hair a lot and again
yeah I really use these hair products
currently this is a really really nice
one though it doesn't leave any sort of
like crunchiness in your hair which I
really really appreciate I think that's
great and then here I have it they do
the hoola from benefit to this made my
skin it looks so orange is basically
just a cream a bronzer and it really is
not cute on the skin it's just straight
up bronze or like yellow or orange II on
me maybe if someone had more of a warmer
undertone I pull a cool undertone but
maybe if someone had more of a warmer
undertone that would work for them next
I have some little tarts minis here that
I'm going to go ahead and probably send
to my friend Haley these are the eternal
let's see here plush and glamorous lip
surgence
little cram sticks they're really really
cute I got all of these in a set around
the holiday season they're beautiful
really really pretty colors as you guys
can see is super super gorgeous very
very neutral and natural but I have so
much stuff like this in my collection
and I'm going to be doing a big lip
declutter for you guys soon so there's
just no need for me to really hold on to
these especially when I'm not reaching
for them very often so I'm going to go
ahead and let go of those next we do
have the dry bar the chaser shine cream
at this
a really really nice product again can't
use it on my hair currently so I'm gonna
let go of that next I have this gosh
cosmetics what is this called a
multicolored blush in the shade of pink
pie I tried to pan this and I tried so
hard in this little different here I
just broke it right there but I barely
made a dent I tried to use this up in my
makeup use of 2016 challenge I mean this
thing lasted forever I'm just kind of
sick of it at this point let me go ahead
and swatch it for you guys it's just one
of those things where I'm just kind of
like I'm over it I'm over it every time
I look at it I just remember how I
wasn't able to actually finish it off so
I'm gonna go ahead and let go of it
because I feel like it's lost its magic
in my collection I'm just kind of like
angry and now so letting go of that here
we have the Moroccan oil treatment for
hair this is really beautiful I do
prefer the light version but again can't
really use that on my hair currently I'm
gonna let that go all right we have
another blush here from Illamasqua this
is the powder blusher in the shade
ambition this one I think I'm just going
to go ahead and toss I feel like it has
gone bad it is very very scratchy to the
touch and let me tell you these blushes
are just not like that and it's so not
pigmented anymore it looks very
lackluster so if my friend Rochelle
doesn't want to take this I'll let it go
to her but I don't know I kind of feel
like it's gone bad the funny thing is
this smell has not changed and I
normally noticed with blushes that the
smell will change if it has gone bad but
I don't know I feel like I have to let
go of that next I have a full-size
perfume here that I'm gonna let go this
is fancy by Jessica Simpson it gives me
such a headache you guys oh yeah I just
can't do it
the bottle is beautiful I've had this
open for over a year but I've tried I've
really tried to use it but I just can't
anymore I don't want to bring it I have
the cargo blush here in the shade the
Big Easy haven't even used this once but
I have so many colors like this in my
collection so I just don't feel like I
need to next we have some perfumes and
stuff well first we have this little
becca mini right here in the shade opal
this is in the poured version which is
kind of like a creme this is just a
little too dark for my skin tone so I
think I'll go ahead and get that to
Haley she's a little darker than me
Estee Lauder revitalizing supreme a
global anti edge cream cheese yeah aging
creme really really beautiful I love
this
every time I use this I'm tempted to buy
a full-size estee lauder obviously tests
on animals so I just thought get rid of
all your minis don't even go there
here is the list soft perfume in the
shade of Zazu or not in the shade in the
scent it's so good but I feel like this
is going to melt when we're down in
Arizona so that's why I'm letting go of
it it smells like jasmine I really like
that so you just kind of put it onto
your wrist I think it's a really
beautiful scent and super super cute
little packaging as you guys can see
alright next I have a bunch of little
perfume and minis here although these
are adorable they look like little
gemstones like sitting in your
collection I just don't want to pack
these I don't find it worth the space so
here's a little Michael Kors none of
these have gone bad so again I'm gonna
send them to my friends here's Bulgari
here we have Lady Gaga perfume at this
little one Miss Dior I mean look at this
bottle like look at this little bottle
it's just so cute here's a Vince Camuto
one or comodo Camuto I don't know and
then I have like a crush by Rihanna in a
rollerball I have the DKNY be Delicious
which again I love that in a full-size I
do have it in full size but again I'm
just not too prone to using roller balls
and then I'm going to let go of this one
as well which kind of like hurts me
because it's such a beautiful scent but
it is the forever red from a bath and
Bodyworks again it's in a rollerball
form and I just don't use it enough so
gonna let go of that I have this little
guy right here which is called real tree
Eau de Parfum and this gave me a
headache
I got it in some sort of a I was going
to say prescription box subscription box
not going to use that black opium from
YSL again smells amazing but I just
don't like dumping it out onto my wrists
I'm Way too messy for that
another holographic photo flash gloss
here this one is from Estee edits line
not really into the Estee edit line here
as they talk of Florence spray I just
feel like one of my friends would really
really like this yeah I feel like this
is totally senora's kind of scent so I'm
going to go ahead and let that go to her
I have a pop lip balm right here it's
called the BB lip balm it's a beautiful
beautiful color and I don't know why I
don't reach for this more often look at
that color it's so beautiful but I just
never gets touched in my collections I'm
going to go ahead and let that go I do
have this little jelly pom-pom lip blush
this is like a really pretty lip crayon
and I really like the color it's kind of
like a strawberry like a true strawberry
color which i think is beautiful but
again never reach for it here is the
stowaway mini lipstick in the shade a
muted plum beautiful beautiful little
mini and I know my friend Haley loves
little minis and then here we do have
the CM style a style of de Pepe this is
the Catherine am el drano or whatever
this smells horrible I just have to
throw this I will not give this to any
of my friends it does not smell good at
all a little mini a Burberry perfume
another Vince Camuto one and then we do
have this little cream blush here from
bang a beauty I do not really like cream
a product in general so this is just
going to go to Rachelle she has more dry
skin than I do
it's in the shade adults a pink and it
just comes in a nice little glass
container like that and then here I do
have the nest indigo a roll-on I just
thought I would send this to Rachelle
because I really want her to try out the
scent I think she would enjoy it here is
the weekend from Burberry and again
another little cute little thing like
this but it's just like I don't want to
pack that in my collection like there is
not room for extra cute stuff like this
it's just not worth it and then finally
guys we have the Melissa autry lipstick
in the shade this is what it looks like
it's actually really pretty lipstick but
I do find it a little drying up but look
at that color is that not really pretty
I really like that so anyway gonna go
ahead and let go of that as well so that
is part one of my beauty purge I will
have per to going up tomorrow like I
said this was just a bunch of random as
crap that was just sitting around it's
just stuff that I don't want to pack you
know a little mini stuff I feel like a
lot of the time tiny little deluxe like
samples and samples just really really
clutter up your collection and it moving
has been a really nice excuse for me to
go ahead and get through this stuff and
be like bye bye
so anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
thank you so much for joining me and
I'll see you tomorrow for part two bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
