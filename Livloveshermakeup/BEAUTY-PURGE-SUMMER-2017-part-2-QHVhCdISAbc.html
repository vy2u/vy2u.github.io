channel this video is going to be part
to you in my massive beauty purge that I
am doing before I'm moving across the
country these are products that I just
don't want to travel with so I'm going
to go ahead and donate them or give to
friends so let's go ahead and jump right
into it I'll go ahead and link a part
one above if you would like to check it
out the first item I have here today is
the volcanic and egg egg white pore cool
meringue pack from skin-food
this was sent to me for PR I mentioned
it in a product sales video it's just
not meant for my skin type so I'm going
to go ahead and let it go next I do have
this pro can excel um-- root boost
finish and body builder this is actually
a hair care product you spray it in your
hair it gives a lot of volume and of
like body to your actual hair without
leaving it crunchy but unfortunately I
recently had scalp surgery due to lupus
and I just can't use this currently so
I'm gonna let it go next I have this
little tart desire cheek stain this has
actually gone bad so I'm gonna toss that
next we have a sinful shine a topcoat
made in the USA it's just a nail-polish
topcoat
I've never even got into it so I'm gonna
go ahead and let that go next I do have
two blushes here one is from ELF it is
the baked blush in the shade peachy
cheek II I feel like I really have to
dig into this product and it's very very
hard with a brush to actually pick it up
so it's just not worth it I have better
blushes in my collection gonna let that
go I also have the L'Oreal visible lift
color lift blush now I really like the
formula on these which is crazy because
they are a cream and I am just not a
cream blush kind of girl in fact I'm
just not a cream kind of girl in general
whether it be eyeshadows face products
anything like that so although this is a
very pretty color there is a color in
the collection called rose gold which I
prefer that's the one I'm going to keep
and I'm gonna let go of this one which
is called coral lift next we have an
eyeshadow palette here from Too Faced it
is the Christmas in New York Mary
macarons a vanilla scented eyeshadow
palette I tried this out about a month
ago and I just feel like I have so many
neutral palettes even drugstore palettes
that beat this out like crazy so I mean
I just don't feel like I need to hold on
to this I do like the shade chocolate
raspberry but the majority of these
shades really got muddled together
although it does smell really good it's
just not something that I feel like it's
worth while packing so I'm going to go
ahead and let go of that next I have a
little big blush here from makeup
revolution I really like these but I do
find that the colors are very similar to
one another this one right here is
called one foreplay
games so I'm going to go ahead and let
go of it it is a beautiful beautiful
kind of lilac shade and if you use it
light enough with like with a light
brush or a light hand it actually can
worked as a really really pretty kind of
like amethyst sort of highlight I guess
you could say alright next I have the
absolute love strawberry lip balm this
has gone a bad
it's crusting over and it smells like
ass so I'm going to go ahead and a
declutter that also this little Milani
quad right here is going bad this is
called the 0-3 Florence Milani first
foil eyes shines I've gone through two
of these they're beautiful but they go
bad pretty quickly so gonna toss that
next I do have this
oh my brow brow highlighter I've never
even used this so just gonna go ahead
and let it go I don't feel like I need
it again don't love cream products next
I have the dr. Brandt ooh dr. Brandt of
microdermabrasion age defying exfoliator
I'm not a huge fan of this I don't think
it's very good so gonna go ahead and let
it go alright another little deluxe size
here this is from way or way haircare or
whatever it's called this is the
treatment mask haven't even tried this a
but again I had to be very careful with
my scalp currently so I'm not going to
use that so I'm going to go ahead and
let it go
nest citrine is this is a really really
nice little rollerball I want my friend
to try out this sin so I'm going to go
ahead and send that to her next I have
the elf contouring blush and bronzing it
powder in the shade I believe this one
is called Tiki it's like a gorgeous
gorgeous I believe this is like a dupe
for narcissus orgasm even though I don't
think they're similar and that this
one's supposed to be a dupe for Lagoona
I don't know if this is a dupe for
Lagoona but I do have a full size of
narcissus orgasm and they're not really
that similar but it's just a peachy kind
of duo and then you have a bronzer over
here not a huge fan not something I
reach for very often so I'm going to let
that go here's a little mini Tory Burch
perfume again it never reach for it's
going to let it go I have a body butter
here from Laura Mercier and attacked
Osito it smells really good but I don't
feel like these actually moisturize my
body enough so I'm going to let that go
I have a torch brush here it is very
very flimsy it came out from the Holiday
Collection not this past year but the
year before really really flimsy not
very good quality so I'm going to go
ahead and let that go
next is the mimimi cosmetics lip glide
this is in a really really pretty kind
of hot coral shade I don't think I've
ever used it so I'm just going to go
ahead and let it go I have so many
colors like this in my collection next I
do have the pop of
passion this is from bareMinerals in the
shade at pink passion it's a really
really pretty pink tinted lip balm very
much up my alley but I think I'm going
to keep the nude one instead of this one
so I'm going to let go of that another
little mini here we have Girl Meets
pearl this is a liquid pearl for face
this is from a Benefit Cosmetics I never
use cream highlighters really so I'm
going to go ahead and let that go
here is the Jordana blush that is very
very basic I have so many colors like
this but these Jordana blushes are
kick-ass I do have quite a few in my
collection and I do like the formula
this is called passion rose it's
beautiful but I have so many colors like
this so I just feel like I should let it
go now I do have some simple supplements
here I was gonna swap robots I got
supplements here from ahum nutrition I
used to take these and now I had to be
careful right now because I just got off
of a lupus trial and there's only
certain things that I can put in my body
for the next three months but I would
definitely go back to these they're
really really nice this first one is
called turn back time it is an age
defying cell protection supplement and
this one has vitamin C and alpha lipoic
acid in it or liquid acid or whatever
this one is called the Big Chill it says
it helps cope without oh now I'm sorry
it helps you cope with and remove the
signs of stress I could use one of those
right now it has a row dealio extract
and a little bit of something else I
can't pronounce these ingredients but it
does work and I do enjoy that and then
this one right here is really good this
is called daily cleanse it helps clear
your skin and body from toxins it really
does work it has ink selenium copper and
magnesium here which is really really
nice feel like I'm not pronouncing any
of those vitamins correctly but that's
okay alright next I do have this little
guy this is the Neutrogena
ageless intensive deeper wrinkle Moi's
Chur eyes are actually finish this up so
this is a product empty really really do
like this if you're looking for a good
retinol product I'm over the counter
this is great I don't know why it's in
here should have been in my empties bin
alright next we have a single shadow
from meet matrimony palette from the
balm cosmetics it's so tiny and adorable
the shade is called Mac Kumar which is a
beautiful beautiful kind of like reddish
color but I feel like anything in my
modern renaissance palette kind of dupes
this out so I don't need it I have a
little mini tortoise lip paint right
here in the shade Rose a I haven't even
tried this I'm not into liquid lipsticks
anymore I just don't find them very
comfortable so I'm going to let go of
that the Jane Eyre dough smooth affair
primer
have gone bad so I'm gonna let go of
that Burberry fresh glow luminous fluid
based also has gone bad gonna go ahead
and let go of that the Roche Posay this
is the purifying foaming cream I thought
my friend Rochelle might like to try
this out I also have two perfumes here
let's see this one is called sexy
vanilla and this one is called
mysterious Roe is going to go ahead and
give these to the girls downstairs at
the front desk they really like these
perfumes so I think they would enjoy
those ivy josie maran whipped argan oil
in be joyfull vanilla apricot my friend
Rochelle wanted to try the scent out I
do have three full sizes of this so I
don't need this little mini it smells
amazing the vanilla apricot scent is to
die for so yeah now that here is a
eyeliner or a nude lip liner
oh yeah it's a nude lip liner I haven't
even taken out of the packaging I don't
wear lip liner enough so just going to
go ahead and let that go
here is a Stila afterglow lip crayon I
liked these they were very bright and
pretty but they went bad so I'm going to
go ahead and toss this one it is in the
shade a tangerine dream they were nice
but it's not working for me anymore
all right acne free therapeutic sulfur
masks it's great it's got copper and
vitamin C in here it has gone bad so I'm
going to toss that next I have the city
color bold brow haven't even cracked
into this yet it looks a little too dark
for me so I'm going to go ahead and
declutter that to a friend
the Alpha volumizing and defining
mascara has gone bad but it is a good at
mascara so that is possibly something I
would repurchase here is the urban decay
afterglow a tower powder highlighter and
you shade sin this is just a little
sample I have a full-size so no need to
hold on to that there are some little
mini Dior Addict perfumes these have
gone bad they reek so I'm going to go
ahead and let go of those here is the
Dior captured Hotel dream skin it's
basically just a kind of like a fluid
base so you can kind of use it as a
moisturizer or a serum or even a primer
gonna let go of that I have another lip
liner here from iby beauty in the shade
of blush again I just don't use lip
liners and not so I'm gonna let go of
that here is a little what is this
called de calais this is a hydrating oil
serum you know I think I might want to
try this out maybe I'll travel with this
for the trip so actually I'm gonna hold
on to that one here we do have the
Charlotte Tilbury brush set this was
sent to me for PR I don't like it I
don't like it I talked about in a
product sales video actually I think I
talked about in a fails and Holly grills
but these brushes are very very scratchy
but my friend Rochelle said she would
love to
try them super cute little case
obviously for travel but it's just not
word that I feel like they're so
scratchy on the face here is the Korres
golden crocus ageless slap yet ageless
saffron elixir I cannot talk today this
is what it looks like it comes in a
beautiful little gold tube and I really
like this as like a pre sort of primer
kind of reminds me a little bit of like
the unicorn essence but better
ingredients like you can see the same
sort of sticky or tacky face now I have
twelve of these twelve of these in minis
so I'm thinking of purchasing a
full-size I wanted to send this one to
Rachelle she could try it out next I
have this little Revlon quad here this
is in free spirit never ever reach for
this they're very firmly pressed the
shadows are there's such pretty colors
like I love this transition shade this
for putting in the big you know the
crease or something or defining the eye
such pretty colors but again they're
just not very good quality so I'm going
to let that go
IV Maybelline chic Naturals linen single
here this used to have a lot of
sentimental meaning to me but it no
longer really does so I'm going to go
ahead and let that go although I hit pan
it's just cut become like very firmly
press and it's not good anymore alright
here is the Sephora contour eye pencil
12-hour wear waterproof I haven't even
opened this up I'm pretty sure I got it
in a Sephora play bag a lot of that
stuff I just never get into you know I
love those little Sephora play boxes and
all the little subscription boxes but I
never really get into those products
just because I never do alright here is
a tarte lipsurgence creme in the shade
stunning which is a beautiful nude gonna
go ahead and let that go here is the
latent in Deni a beautiful beautiful
polished look at that color isn't that
gorgeous but again I'll never use it so
letting that go here is the way haircare
it way way I don't know I think it's way
haircare wave spray this did not work
for me any irritated my scalp so I'm
gonna go ahead and let that go a little
mini flower bomb look at that adorable
bottle like can we just take a moment so
so so cute low flower bomb but I have it
in full size so I don't need that DKNY
also have this in a full-size don't need
that here is another Estee Lauder
revitalizing supreme a global anti-aging
creme every time I use this I want a
full-size of it so I just try and stay
away from it it is a very very good
facial moisturizer but Estee Lauder
tests on animals and I don't want to be
tempted
all right here is the EM princess
eyeshadow single I don't even know how
to open this but it's like a pretty topi
shade gonna go ahead and let that go
never use it here is the needy me
cosmetics liquid highlighter haven't
even opened it out of its packaging not
going to use it I'm gonna let it go
here is a tartan Muse cheek stain this
has gone bad gonna let that go bare skin
sheer Sun from beer and minerals I'm
gonna go ahead and send that to Rachelle
she loves liquid bronzers elf smudge pot
in the shade gold really really pretty
but just can't get into cream products
like I said so gonna let that go
obviously the joyful shade and vitamin E
body lotion from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
smells amazing they describe it as let's
see her sparkling Clementine golden
mango frosted Jasmine winter melon and
shimmering sugar but basically it's just
Clementine mango jasmine and melon it
smells great I'm just not a huge fan of
this formula I really really like the
aromatherapy line now for Bath and Body
Works so I'm gonna let that go right
here we have a liquid lipstick from
Kaelyn this is the pure less extreme max
tint but not going to ever try this out
because I just don't like liquid
lipsticks anymore they're too drying on
my lips letting that go here is a
victoria secret hydrating body lotion
and coconut milk it smells amazing it's
beautiful beautiful quality tried to get
through it in a project pan never was
able to you so I'm going to go ahead and
let go of that
here is another humm supplement this one
is called red carpet it's for glowing
skin and shiny hair I believe this is
the cheapest one that you can get on the
sephora.com website it has a vitamin e
in it too black and black currant oil
it's really nice I do feel like it
helped my nails grow quite a bit but not
so sure about my hair alright next we
have the charge of joyful cheek stain
again if this has gone bad so I'm going
to go ahead and let that go to my dad
talking in the background if you hear
him next we have the J cap Beauty
lovestruck blush it's beautiful the
formula of these are really really nice
but this color I just feel like I have
ones like this in my collection so I'm
gonna let go of this one but keep the
peachy or poorly one next we have the
baby whores Dooku lovers perfume this
gives me a headache like a massive
massive headache so I have to let this
go I think it was Gwen Stefani's line
here is the Kat Von D what is this
called um say alchemist no it's
basically just a pigment in a really
really interesting goldish Moss color I
never
it came up with these serpentina palette
so I'm gonna let that go
here is the Josie Maran whipped argan
oil face butter I have a full-size of
this so don't need that here is a
Smashbox with liquid lipstick in the
shade a 6'5 really really pretty and
never gonna reach for it cuz it's a
liquid lipstick Dolce &amp;amp; Gabana light
blue this used to be like my signature
perfume I'm pretty sure it's a cologne
but it's like unisex it smells so good
I'm gonna go ahead and send that to you
at Rochelle so she can try it out
Manhattan Beach Beach butter hand cream
smells amazing but I have 16 open hand
creams currently I'm never going to get
to this before it goes bad so it's got
to go here is a little glam and natural
mascara I've only used it once or twice
I didn't like the wand but it hasn't
gone bad so I'm going to give it to a
friend as you can see it's a little easy
bTW tiny wand so it's very nice for
getting into the lower lashes a Watts up
highlighter from the benefit again don't
do cream very often a NARS lip pencil a
Too Faced melted liquefied long-wear
lipstick in the shade a melted buried
that has to go needs to be tossed cuz
it's gone bad a butter LONDON nail
lacquer in the shade Ruby Marais which
is a beautiful color again Michelle's
gonna love that I have to give that to
her a baby lips lip gloss in the shade
pink pinky I don't know it looks pink
that's what it looks like I really love
baby lips but this was just not a good
product it I felt like I was wearing
like in lip gloss you know what I mean
like kids boy makeup so anyway I didn't
like that let it go
but these NARS little guys right here I
think this is in Brooke Hogan yeah this
is nice but I just I have other lip
krantz I'm a bigger fan of so letting go
of that and then also letting go of
these yours your Armani a fluid shear
all right here is collagen love from
Hama nutrition this one's also really
really nice you have to take like four
of these a day though I don't like
taking that many pills so let go that
the Wella
oil reflection smoothing oil for hair
haven't even tried this can't really put
it on my scalp because it does have
alcohol in it next we have a Tarte
lights camera lashes mascara I don't
know about you guys but Tarte mascaras
make my eyelashes fall out I have no
idea why so obviously letting go of that
royal Apothic tee ball firming eye
treatment lovely eye cream there's only
a tiny bit left but I'm not going to
finish it off before it goes bad so
giving that to a friend
here is a Versace a little mini of
perfume again so adorable but when am I
ever gonna get to these and I hate
opening them up and having to put them
on my arm I hate that so letting go of
that here is the Brio geo historical
milk respira reparative reparative
leave-in conditioning spray I have like
six of these and I have a full size so
let go that here is a covergirl quad in
the shade of blossoms super super pretty
colors but these are firmly pressed and
not very easy to work with they were at
first but now they're not so don't like
that an Elfa blush that has definitely
gone bad this is in candid coral gonna
toss that a Milani eyeshadow single
again in Bella teal I feel like I showed
one of these in yesterday's video I have
like a million of these in the shade in
the same shade I have absolutely no idea
why but that is Bella teal is just a
really really pretty kind of bluish
color I don't know why I have so many of
these color I just don't I don't need it

tanner not going to use that don't need
it and then finally I do have another
