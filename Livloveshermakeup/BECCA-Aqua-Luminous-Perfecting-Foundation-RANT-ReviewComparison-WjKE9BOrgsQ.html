in this video I will be giving you guys
my review on the new Becca aqua luminous
perfecting foundation that recently
released at Sephora calm that is where I
picked it up this was a $44 foundation
and you do get one fluid ounce of
product you can also get this on the
altar calm website it is available there
for the same exact price they have the
same shade range they have eight
different shades I will get into that in
a minute because that is the one big big
big con about this foundation is the
shade selection but anyway um it is $44
on each website and I don't believe they
have it on me Bekka website yet I don't
know if they will I'm sure they will but
they don't right now so I will link
below where you guys can pick it up from
the Sephora calm website or the Ulta
calm web say if you are interested they
are not affiliate links just so you guys
know so basically this is supposed to be
a very very light weight luminous
foundation it's water based and it
basically is the exact like duplicate or
it supposed to be going head-to-head in
competition with the Stila aqua glow
serum foundation I recently reviewed
this and I will link down below if you
guys want to see the video on this I
think this a really positive review I
really loved this I thought the shade
range was great I thought it really wore
beautifully on my skin I was able to
build it up nicely so I will leave below
the video for that if you guys are
interested because I feel like they're
going head-to-head the Beca one is $44
and the Stila one is $45 so just one
dollar difference they do have the same
amount of product in them and I would
say the comparison between the two I do
prefer the steal one but I'm going to
talk about that right now so the bag of
foundation I'm gonna read a little bit
about what it says on these sephora.com
website for you guys you can kind of
understand what they were going for it
is supposed to be a light buildable
foundation that imparts subtle
luminosity with a weightless feel I'm
gonna stop right there really quickly
because I don't find that this
foundation built at all on my skin it
definitely has the same kind of
consistency as the Stila aqua glow it's
a very very water like a very very fluid
like like able just if you put it on the
back of your head
it literally will run down the back of
your hand but I just want to say I feel
like the steel of one really does build
up I can actually build up a couple
layers of this and get nice coverage
whereas with this Beca one I'm wearing
two layers of it today and it looked the
exact same when I put one layer on so it
doesn't build up very nicely on the skin
but that's what the that's what it plans
on the website so I'm going to continue
reading it says smooth on foundation
coverage that feels ultra light and
buildable while it evens and perfects
your complexion every weightless drop of
fluid in part subtle luminosity that
blurs imperfections and leaves a soft
focused glow the foundation features a
curated array of eight flexible shades
that flatter all skin tones alright so
right away I will say that this does
have a little bit of luminosity it
really does blur the skin beautifully
like I said I'm wearing it today I
really think it's beautiful on the skin
it looks like skin if I were to take a
mirror and look really close up and I'm
under some pretty harsh lights right now
you know I have like a ring light which
is pretty harsh I would look and I would
see nothing it really really does look
like skin it's absolutely stunning on
the skin I think it does have a little
bit of luminosity they're really just
blurs the complexion beautifully but
this is where the issue comes in they
say the foundation features a curated
array of eight flexible shades that
flatter all skin tones alright guys so
this shade that I have is fair and this
is supposed to be a fair color with
neutral undertones this is probably two
to three shades darker than my skin tone
and I am fair skinned okay let me show
you guys what it looks like so this is
the packaging by the way like I said it
is 1 fluid ounce and it kind of has that
what is this called it's like that
mmm this has the exact word like clouded
glass bottle so I really do like the
glass bottle compared to the Stila one
the steel one is plastic so this one
definitely feels a lot nicer it's a lot
more weighted but again you do get the
same amount of product so what you're
supposed to do is shake it up a really
nicely and then you guys can see the
little top there when you go like this
it pops out so let me show you get it
pops up like that then you want to push
this down so you can fill up the
applicator you take it out and it has
the same sort of applicator applicator
as the Stila one but anyway let me get
back to the shade thing so this is fair
with neutral under
let me show you guys what their version
of fair is because I'm about to have
little rat here I'm just like really
that's fair
really really back up that's fair let me
blend that in a little bit so you guys
can see that is their fair shade and
this is the lighter shape that they have
in the collection so I know that this is
a new product and sometimes brands will
go and they will release only a few
shades like I said right now they have
eight different shades that are
available and they won't release a full
collection of Shadia because they don't
know how well it will do but to be
completely honest becca has become such
a big brand in the past year and a half
to two years i can't see why you know
they wouldn't add this as a permanent
collection in there as a permanent
foundation in their collection basically
so I'd love it to show you guys like
this color that I just wiped off does
that look anywhere near my skin tone to
you guys I mean really it's just
disappointing I guess it's just
disappointing honestly Becca if L'Oreal
and Revlon can make a shape that matches
me and they are drugstore products why
why can't you guys make a shade that
actually is for fair skin tones so I
guess the reason I'm kind of ranting
about this is because they keep talking
about how they're so flexible and
there's so many different shades well
let me read you guys the eight different
shades so they have fair which is fair
with neutral undertones the second one
is called light which is light with
neutral undertones the third one is
called beige which is light / medium
with neutral undertones then you have
medium which is medium with neutral
undertones kin which is medium / tan
with neutral undertones warm honey is
medium / deep then you have dark golden
and then the darkest shade is called
deep bronze I'm going to go ahead and
say and please let me know if you are a
dark skinned Beauty please let me know
if you have tried this foundation and if
that deep bronze shade is actually your
shade because I cannot imagine a
foundation called deep bronze being dark
enough for everybody so this is just one
of those kind of things where I feel
like a lot of brands go and they
to only the people that have a medium
skin tone it's nothing that I'm not used
to I just find it kind of upsetting that
Beca especially because they are a
high-end brand I just find it a little
upsetting that their fair shade is
literally three to four shades darker
than my skin tone so that is really I
will say that is really the only con
about this foundation and I just don't
like that they keep talking about how
it's flexible shades they everybody will
get a shade you know all this kind of
stuff because Omni sephora.com website
they have like a link to a YouTube video
where they actually had one of the I
think she's like the director I don't
want to say the director here I actually
have it right here introducing Becca
luminous foundation I don't know she's
she's like one of the main backup people
and she was basically applying this on
people's skin and she was talking about
the product and she kept saying it's so
flexible it will match everybody you
know bla bla bla bla bla bla bla and I'm
like listen if they hadn't brought that
up over and over and over again and if
they would just stop saying that it
matches everybody and it works for
everyone then I wouldn't complain about
it so much
but anyway long story short guys that is
really my only big complaint with this
is that um the shade Fair is about three
to four shades maybe even five shades
steeper than my skin tone so I would
recommend if you are going to pick this
product go ahead go in store and swatch
it on your arm or your neck first now
let's get into what I do like about the
foundation the first thing I had said
was that I love the way it sits on the
skin it absolutely looks like skin it's
just luminous it's beautiful it's not
like there's chunks of glitter or
anything like that in the foundation it
just imparts some sort of luminosity
kind of like hourglass ambient lighting
powders you know how you put those on
and you don't see chunks of glitter you
just see like a glow like a bit of
luminosity that's really what this
foundation does for my skin and what I
think it does for everybody's skin if
you were to try it out I think it's
absolutely absolutely beautiful it wears
very very long especially if you have a
primer on I find that I can apply this
with my fingertips and that's what they
recommend they kind of recommend tapping
it in and just you know building up on
certain areas that you want to build it
up on like I said
you prefer the Stila aqua glow for
building up to more of like a medium
coverage I don't think this one really
builds up that well it just gets more
and more noticeable the more you put on
and like I said today I'm wearing two
layers and I think it looks beautiful
but it looked the same when I put one
layer on so you might as well just do
one layer they recommend
like I said shaking the bottle first and
then you want to dispense it and put a
whole drop or full on the back of your
hand and then if you need more you can
just go back in
I applied mine today with eight damp
Real Techniques sponge I think it's
absolutely beautiful I love the finish
that I got on the skin and yeah let me
show you guys the Box this is what the
box looks like typical kind of Becca
packaging let's see if they say anything
different on the back it says veil your
skin with foundation coverage that feels
water light while it evens and protects
the complexion each weightless fluid
drop in part subtle luminosity that
blurs imperfections definitely agree
with that and creates a soft focus
clothes it really really does do that
it's absolutely beautiful in a range of
flexible shades with light buildable
coverage aqua luminous perfecting
foundation imparts a healthy natural
glow so overall I think it really is a
beautiful foundation I just kind of had
to have a little bit of rant about the
whole eight different shades that they
have again they may come out with
different shades they may come out with
a porcelain shade or a really really
deep dark shade it could just be because
they just released this product they
don't know how well it's going to do but
I might let you guys know right away if
you are very fair and you do want to try
out this foundation I have tried mixing
mine with the matte face and body
foundation in white and I think that
this doesn't really disrupt any of the
light texture of the product if that
makes sense it's not going to disrupt
the finish of the product it's not going
to add coverage or take any away you
really can just mix about half and half
and you should get a nice color for your
skin and also the illamasqua rich liquid
foundation they have these in RF 100 and
RF 105 I believe both of them you can
still get this has a lot of pigment to
it so if you want to build up coverage
do you want just like a little more
coverage in here you can mix it with
that one but again one of the reasons
that I picked up this foundation was
because I've really been into these
lighter kind of water like fluid like
foundations on my skin so it's kind of a
shame that I have to reach for a white
mix or foundation but today I'm not
wearing it with my white mixer
foundation I just have a very very light
colored powder on top it is the NYX
blotting powder in I believe it's fair
or light which does have some color to
it so anyway overall I think it is a
really beautiful foundation I will not
be returning it just because if you know
just because it doesn't match my skin
tone exactly does not mean I will return
it I have plenty of foundations that
don't match my skin tone exactly I feel
like that is just one of those things
when you're really really fair or really
really dark you get used to companies
not coming out with your sort of shade
basically but overall I think it's
beautiful on the skin it wears a very
very long time I was very surprised by
that I thought it would kind of start to
break up in my t-zone I do a combination
skin but surprisingly I don't get oily
in my t-zone whatsoever and I feel like
with the Stila one as well I don't get
too oily so it's kind of cool that these
water-based products aren't making me
super oily in my t-zone so when it comes
down to it which one would I choose if I
had to choose one of these I think the
packaging on the Bekaa one is much
better I think it's a very very pretty
if there's one of those people that have
like all your foundations out on your
vanity area this one is gonna look a lot
prettier than the Stila one this is just
this is a pretty bottle but it's not
glass it's plastic so it's you know they
basically have the same little
applicator you open it up the thing pops
out and then they have the little
dropper but overall I would say that
this Stila one is the one that I would
pick and the one that I would repurchase
over the Bekaa one just because I feel
like I can build up coverage with the
Stila one and also it's a better shave
match for me let me show you guys
quickly what the Aqua glow one looks
like I know I said I'll link the review
down below but this is their version of
fair and I'm like yes much much much
better so anyway I hope you guys enjoyed
this review and my small little rant
about
shade ranges I hope that you guys will
subscribe if you are new to my channel
and I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
