review and swatches with you guys on all
of the new Becca backlight targeted
color correctors I picked up all four
shades and these are basically just
colored targeted correctors and I
thought you know what I should try them
all out if they don't work for me I can
always return them but I thought you
know what it would be good to try it out
on someone who has my skin tone to see
if the actual colors because there are
two in here that are like dark orange
colors I wanted to see if I could test
them out on my fair skin and see if they
would work for me and I'm really happy
to let you guys know they do work for me
so I'm gonna read a little bit about
what they say on the a sephora.com
website like how they describe the
product what it's supposed to be so this
is the Becca Becca light targeted color
correctors there are four different
shades you have one that is called
violet which neutralizes dullness to
brighten the skin you have one shade
called peach which neutralizes dark
spots and hyperpigmentation to even out
the skin you have another one called
papaya which neutralizes deep blues and
greens to even out the skin tone and
then you have a shade called pistachio
which neutralizes redness to even skin
tone so these are highly pigmented color
corrector infused light reflecting
pearls basically like the the formula is
mixed in with light reflecting pearls
whatever that means I think that they're
kind of going for that whole they have
like a primer the backlight targeted
primer or whatever it's called I haven't
tried that out yet but I heard that it
also has those light reflecting pearl
like qualities to it it's supposed to
get like a soft to focus effect on the
skin so anyway it says the Becca
backlight targeted color correctors
feature a highly pigmented formula that
targets and adheres to specific areas of
concern it's like reflecting pearls in
parts of a luminosity that help to blur
the look of imperfections it is
formulated without parabens and fat
elates and it says choose the shade that
matches your skin concern pistachio
which will help neutralize redness to
even your skin tone a violet which
neuters neutralizes dullness papaya
which neutralizes deep blues like
underneath your eyes or peach which
neutralizes dark spots and
hyperpigmentation
so I was really really excited about
these like I said I did purchase all
four shades I have them here for you
guys and really really cute packaging
you get let's see 4.5 grams of product
in here or 0.16 ounces
and they are the exact same size and the
exact same I don't want to say formula
but they have a very similar formula to
the Bekaa ultimate coverage concealing
creme this is a concealer that they
released probably a year ago year and a
half ago and I really really love it my
shade is called praline and it is just
so full coverage and so creamy and so
luxurious and I really really enjoy this
a lot so when I saw that Becca had
posted photos of these targeted color
correctors on their Instagram I was like
wow that looks similar in the
formulation to that concealing creme so
I was really really happy to find out
that they are very similar they come in
little boxes that look like this I have
all four boxes here and they're just
really really cute I feel like Becca
doesn't do that whole thing where they
over package things it's just very very
easy tiny little box like this like I
said there is 4.5 grams of product in
here so you are getting a nice amount
and let me show you guys what the colors
look like so this is the peach one and
again it kind of has like that
I always forget what this is clouded
glass I could call it a glass on the
side and when you open it up this is
what it looks like so this one is called
peach and this is supposed to be good
for hyperpigmentation what I like to use
this for is my acne scarring I have
combination skin and I have dealt with
pretty severe acne when I was younger
right along my jawline it's very
hormonal so I have a hyperpigmentation
right in this area
and my hyperpigmentation tends to be
kind of like a pinky gray color and I
find that this peach shade really really
neutralizes it well so this is the peach
shade it let me go ahead and swatch it
for you guys as you can see it's a very
very creamy formula and it's a very very
connectin tanned by humectants I just
mean it's a very very moisturizing so
that is what the peach shade looks like
on my hand the next one we have is the
lavender shade which is called violet
and this one is supposed to be for
brightening certain areas of your face
what I like to use the score is to
brighten around my mouth a little bit
above my eyebrows even on my eyelids and
even underneath my eyes anywhere that I
feel like it looks a little dull I will
put this there so this is what the
violet shade looks like and again it has
the same kind of really really creamy
consistency really really beautiful and
I'll swatch that one next to the peach
shade so there is the violet one
underneath peach and then the next one
we have you
is papaya and this is the really really
dark and deep red one that I thought
those definitely won't work for my skin
tone but I'm happy to let you guys know
it does this is supposed to help color
correct underneath your eye area if you
have any sort of dark circles any blue
tones things like that and it really
does work so it's really really like a
red shade definitely deeper than the
peach shade so there is papaya oops
need a little dot a little extra that
and then the last shade we have is
pistachio and this is the red one and
basically if you think of a color wheel
these are all the colors that are
supposed to help color correct on the
opposite side of the wheel if that makes
sense so if you have redness on your
face a green concealer or a green
corrector is going to help cover that up
so again saves that formulation and
there is and let me swatch that you
don't get very much so there is
pistachio so there are all the colors
from the Tokyo peach underneath that you
have violet then you have papaya and
then you have mustachio so let me just
start by saying that these really do
work really really well they are not
concealers I think a lot of people I saw
I read some reviews on these sephora.com
website of people saying oh you know
they're kind of lacking with
pigmentation they're a little thin on
the face these are correctors these are
not concealers if you want something
that is going to cover things up then
you definitely want to go and look for a
concealer I would recommend me Bekka
ultimate coverage concealing creme this
is really really nice it has great
pigmentation and it will really really
cover any area that you need to cover
however what I want to say about these
is targeted correctors are just there to
neutralize a certain color in the skin
whether it be that you have blue
undertones like underneath here like
from not getting enough sleep or you
have hyperpigmentation these are just
supposed to counteract the color they're
not going to be covering they're just
supposed to help counteract the color so
you can see right here there is the
Becca concealer you can see that
actually kind of covers my veins whereas
these definitely have a little more of a
luminosity to them they definitely have
a little more of a wet formula and that
is because they're not meant to cover
they're just meant to color correct so I
am so happy to let you guys know I'm
wearing all of these under my face right
now if you guys can see the thumbnail
for this video that was this
as I was putting these on you can see I
have that papaya shade all the way down
underneath my eyes I have that peach
shade on my hyperpigmentation I have
that pistachio shade on any areas where
I have an active breakout and I also
have that violet shade right around my
mouth above my brows on my whole eyelids
anywhere that I want to brighten so
today I did not put any extra concealer
on over these you can do that they do
suggest doing that if you would really
really like to help cover like dark
circles you can put that papaya shade a
little bit underneath and you want to
kind of put it on the areas where you
get really blue which is usually towards
the front of the eye so you can tap that
in lightly I feel like these go on
really nicely with a brush they go on
nicely with your fingers I don't go
crazy with the blending process I
usually just put them rub them between
my fingers because they are a little
thick and then I just have them where I
want to and then you can go in and you
can even go over that with a concealer
today I just went over with my
foundation and the foundation that I'm
wearing is from let's see here I believe
it's from covergirl it's a very very
light weight kind of luminous foundation
and doesn't have a lot of coverage so I
really wanted you guys to be able to see
that you cannot see any of these colors
through of my skin and I am very very
fair-skinned so I don't want you to be
scared especially if you're really dark
skinned or really light skinned and I
don't want you to be thinking that you
can't use these because all of these
shades are actually usable for I believe
every single skin tone and I believe the
reason why they're not super super
opaque and dark is because then they
wouldn't work for every skin tone a lot
of people in the sephora.com website
we're saying oh you know that violet
shade it just was barely there I
couldn't notice it on my skin these are
not meant to be like oh let me put
purple on my face they're just supposed
to help counteract any other colors that
you may have going on with your skin so
after I apply all of these and I put my
foundation on top I just feel like
everything is completely evened out you
don't see any weird like dullness or
redness you can barely see my
hyperpigmentation it's just a lovely
lovely feeling and I think that the
formulation really is nice because
they're very very humectants like I said
they're very moisturizing so even
underneath the eye they're not gonna
cake up they're not going to make your
eyes look wrinkly they're not gonna do
any of that so they really don't settle
into the skin at which I love so overall
I think there is
tastic product they we're very very well
I would suggest if you do have oily or
combination skin I personally have
combination skin
I would suggest after you put your
foundation on on top of these to go
ahead and set your powder or set your
foundation with a powder because these
are very very moisturizing and they are
a little movable you just want to make
sure that everything is set in place so
that you're not getting oily throughout
the day but overall I think they're
fantastic I mean if they work from my
really really fair skin I think that
they're really gonna work for anybody
and I was super super surprised with
that dark papaya shade I was like am I
really putting this underneath my eye
area and it works perfectly and it's
awesome at concealing so I have never
tried these on top of my foundation I do
know that some people do that and then
they go in with concealer I think that
these are really meant to go underneath
your foundation before your concealer so
you can put them on and then put on your
concealer for extra coverage and then
your foundation or you can do what I did
today
put these correctors on your skin color
correct where you want to and then put
your foundation on top and then just do
the rest of your makeup and I just love
the benefits that it has like it really
doesn't I'm not gonna say that it covers
up like the green one I'm not gonna say
that it covers up any sort of active
breakout but it helps with the redness
which in like any return kind of does
cover it up if that makes sense so I
think the formulation is really
fantastic
I can give you a dry skin you're really
gonna love this formulation because it
is so compact and um and I just think
they're so cool I was really excited
about these and I really thought I was
probably gonna have to return those two
colors the peach and papaya shades but
I'm really happy I don't they work for
me these are the first color correctors
that I have really in like my collection
and I'm really enjoying them a lot so
