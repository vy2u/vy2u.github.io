thank you so much for joining me happy
Halloween today I am doing a review i'm
going to do some swatches and also do a
demo for you guys with two different
brushes on the new becca jaclyn hill
shimmering skin Perfector pressed
palette in champaign glow this is what
the packaging looks like and this is the
outer packaging and on the back you can
see jaclyn and it shows the shades that
are in here and inside of here you get
um three limited edition I believe they
are all limited edition i think the
pearl shade might be just like an
exclusive shade right now to this
palette but it might be um not limited
edition i'm not quite sure i do have the
sephora website pulled up right here so
i can read that for you guys it is it a
sephora exclusive it is limited edition
the whole palette is like I said it's
$34 it says ASA for exclusive curated
palette of three limited edition
shimmering skin Perfector press shades
new pearl blush copper and best-selling
champagne pop jaclyn hill so they are
all limited edition and I just thought
this was going to be great this is part
of their like holiday collection and I
actually never picked up champagne glow
um which is crazy because everybody
raves about that highlighter so I was
like wow you know what I really really
should pick it up so I'm so happy that I
got this let me show you guys what it
looks like on the inside it comes with
this little pamphlet Jacqueline's had a
few words she said I am so thrilled for
champagne pop to be part of Becca's
champagne glow palette I hope you
enjoyed these three beautiful shades the
Becker put together for you hashtag
champagne pop jaclyn hill so really
really cute and I think that's so
wonderful that they um you know put
together this palette I know that um
that particular shade that she put
together really really it like sold out
and sold out again like it's really
really crazy so I think it's so
wonderful but a youtuber here has put
together you know not just you know this
in like a single size but also a palette
I think that's awesome so anyway as you
guys can see you get a nice big mirror
here and then this is what the three
shades look like they are absolutely
gorgeous and I feel like this palette
really really caters to every single
skin tone you know you have this really
really light beautiful pearl color which
is kind of like
cool toned white you know yeah i would
say cool toned white shade it's
absolutely gorgeous then you get the
nice kind of honey golden peachy shade
which is champagne pop that's
Jacqueline's color and that is perfect
for basically anybody skin tone in my
opinion and then you get blush copper
which is down here and this is a
beautiful deep Capri golden shade so
those are what all three of them look
like swatched on my finger i'll go ahead
and swatch them on my hand for you guys
as well so you can see the pigmentation
is just amazing it's absolutely
spectacular they go on so easily and
they're just so they look like they're
almost like metallic like they're wet or
something can you guys see that
absolutely gorgeous you a blush copper
pearl and then a champagne pop at the
bottom but I think they just pick up the
light so beautifully and they glide on
the skin like butter I will say I do get
a small amount of kick up when I put my
brush into any of these shades I do like
to put it in and then tap off the excess
and then apply it wherever I want to put
it and I will say that you know yes this
caters to everybody skin tone but there
are certain shades for me personally
personally and that I can't really wear
as a highlight and that would be the
blush copper shade that is going to be
more of a blush topper for me I can
definitely wear Jacqueline shade the
champagne pop anywhere on my facebook is
a beautiful golden kind of glow to the
skin but my favorite in here is
definitely pearl and that is because I
do have fair skin basically my skin tone
is pretty light and I think that that
one just looks absolutely gorgeous on
the skin so let me read a little more
about what they say on the sephora.com
website like I said it is ASA for
exclusive limited edition $34 it says
this palette is inspired by the festive
holiday season the shimmering shades are
designed to enhance your natural beauty
and allow your features to glow simply
sweep the luxurious luxuriously creamy
luminizing powders across the face or
apply to targeted areas including cheapo
cheekbones brow bones and bridges of the
nose to see how beautifully they catch
the light they are formulated without
parabens and sulfates and what else you
need to know this specially curated
holiday palette extends Jacqueline Hills
collaboration with Becca that started
with the now best-selling shade of
shimmering skin Perfector pressed
champagne pops so I think that that is
so lovely and I love this time of year
when they release all of these pallets
because you can get these for such a
great deal and I do you know I feel like
because this is $34 I know that it might
be a little pricey because honestly two
or three of these is what a full size of
their shimmering skin Perfector looks
like this one right here is the only one
that i have in full size this is the
shade moonstone which is a beautiful i
would say it looks like the combination
of pearl and champagne pop together that
is the kind of color you would get it is
more of a yellowy golden kind of color I
have it's washed right there let me
swatch pearl and champagne pop next to
it so you guys can kind of see what I
mean it is also a gorgeous color but I
feel like if pearl and champagne pop
were um like blended together you would
get that shade so you can see pearl at
the top champagne pop at the bottom and
then you have moonstone in the middle so
really really gorgeous but like I said
you do get a lot more product in the
full-size the full-size runs for
thirty-eight dollars but the reason I
think that this palette is worth the
money is because you are getting three
limited edition shades so you can either
you know splurge and basically pay
ninety dollars for three of the
full-size ones or you can go ahead and
just get this palette so I'm really
really loving it I think the formulation
is awesome it's beautiful um like I said
I do get a little bit of kick up but
that is like my only complaint they
really we're well on the skin they last
all day and they are just absolutely
gorgeous so I'm going to go ahead and
demo them for you guys quickly let me
kind of push my hair back a little bit
so i am going to be demoing them with
two different brushes i have my elf fan
brush here which is a very nice not very
dense brush it's just very very light
and airy i'm going to demo that on this
side of the face i'm going to be using
my favorite color in here which is pearl
and then on this side of the face i am
going to be demoing it with my sigma
tapered highlighter f-35 which is a lot
more dense it's kind of tapered but it
really is a lot more dense and i'm going
to show you guys the difference in how
it can look when it's kind of built up
and things like that so i'm going to
start with the Sigma one and I'm just
going to go into that pearl shade there
and I kind of just tap it in and then I
always tap off the excess and I'm just
going to hit that on my cheekbone so you
guys can already see it builds up
beautifully and pretty quickly so let me
do that again tap off the excess and
then just go right over the cheekbone I
kind of do a sweeping motion all the way
down to the apple of my cheek just
because I like when I smile you can kind
of see the light reflecting off of that
I think that's beautiful so that is a
more kind of built up sort of
application with a more dense brush I'm
going to do the other side now with the
fan brush which won't build up as much
color on you guys will be able to see
let me just show you so again I just
kind of tap into that color and then
apply it and if you want more of a
natural sort of look this is the way to
go with the fan brush it will give a
very very light dusting of the actual
product onto the cheek but it is still
really really beautiful my favorite way
to apply it is definitely with the Sigma
tapered highlighter I just think it's
gorgeous and it gives such a beautiful
glow to the skin so let me go ahead and
even it out I'm gonna put a little on my
chin and I just love the shade you guys
I think it is gorgeous this pearl shade
and yes i love Jacqueline's shade as
well i think all three are gorgeous i
award this blush copper shade over a
blush the other day it was stunning it
gives just the right amount of glow it
is absolutely beautiful and Jacqueline's
hail I mean Jacqueline's a shade as well
it's beautiful absolutely gorgeous but
my favorite is this pro shade and I
think it's just because um you know of
my skin tone because I am a little more
fair so let me build it up on the other
side but yeah this is definitely my
favorite way to apply it you can also
use an even more dense brush if you
really want to work it in but I just
love the way that these powders don't
like sit on top of the skin they really
look like your skin is just glowing from
within and I think they are absolutely
stunning so highly recommend picking
this up um you could definitely go ahead
if you want more product go ahead and
splurge on buying them in the full size
but it
cost you around ninety dollars whereas
if you get this little kit you can try
all three of these out it caters to
basically every single skin tone and
it's only thirty four dollars so anyway
I'm absolutely loving it I am so
thrilled to have it I am even more
thrilled because you know I was one of
those people that didn't actually pick
up champagne pop in the full-size when
it came out so I'm so happy that they
released this and I love all the shades
in there i love the pigmentation i love
the way they sit on top of the skin I
think they are just beautiful beautiful
highlighters so I hope you guys enjoyed
this review and swatches and demo and I
will see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
