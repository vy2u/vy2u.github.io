today's video is going to be a
comparison on two different highlighters
that have the same name that have
recently like been on the market so the
first one is from Becca it is the
shimmering skin perfecter press in the
shade rose quartz and we're also going
to be talking about these UA powder
highlighter in the shade rose quartz I
thought I would go ahead and do a
comparison on these a lot of you have
been asking me and I thought today would
be the perfect day to do so so anyway
let's go ahead and get started
the first item we're going to start with
is the Becca shimmering skin Perfector
in rose quartz in here you are getting 7
grams of product this is what the outer
packaging looks like so as far as outer
packaging is concerned I do prefer the
Becca also you're getting about half the
product in the jus way so this retails
for $38 it is a limited edition on the
Sephora calm website and you guys if you
saw my review you know that I absolutely
adore this I think it's beautiful and
this is what the outer packaging looks
like I made yes packaging Awards right
here winner a very very beautiful nice
glossy finish you open it up and then
you have this beautiful neutral pale
pink highlight a lot of people were
curious if this particular one was the
same sort of shade and I'm going to tell
you guys right away they are very
different but they are a little similar
so if you are curious these you a
highlighter on the other hand has let's
see here
4.5 grams of product so about half the
product about and this retails for $24
so I feel like they're technically the
same like if this was double the size it
would be around the price of the Becca
shimmering skin perfecter and I think
what it comes down to is first of all
color and second of all you know what
kind of texture you like sort of
formulation you like for a highlighter
this one has a very baked Chalet
formulation this one is definitely more
of a powder you guys know I love bake
Chalet formulations and I have to say I
prefer this one a little more than the
rose quartz now if you saw my review on
the rose quartz you know I think it's
really beautiful it's very very
pigmented very very buttery and I think
it's the perfect neutral pink color it
doesn't mean too warm it doesn't mean
too cool it's very very gorgeous on the
skin and you really can build this up
without it looking too cakey you don't
want to put on more than like two layers
of it but it's really gorgeous I like
the way it sits on the skin and I do
think it wears a long time there's you a
rose quartz on the other hand is
definitely more of that facial a
formulation so when you rub your finger
in there you're not necessarily getting
any sort of kick up from the products
because it's not
it really had that nice glossy sort of
formulation that just kind of glides
over your hand so that is one swatch as
you guys can see the difference here
this one is definitely more pigmented I
feel like the Bekaa has a lot more
pigment to it however I will say that
the rose quartz from as you weigh is
very beautiful on the skin this one
definitely wears longer than the Becca
which is surprising because the Becca
wears a very long time on my skin but I
think because the jouer is so
lightweight and just very very glossy on
the skin I think it just stays on a
little longer so I would say if you do
have texture in your skin if you deal
with sort of um acne prone skin things
like that and you don't want to
emphasize any fine lines and wrinkles I
would definitely go for the G way and
then if you just have like regular skin
that you're not too concerned about like
building up any sort of texture or if
you don't have tons and tons of
breakouts and things like that I would
go with you Becca the Becca has a lot
more pigment to it and as you guys can
see from looking at the swatches they
are definitely different in tone the
Becca has more of a neutral pink this
one leans a little more on the cool
toned pink side to me personally it has
a little more of a white base visually
does so I think they're both really
really beautiful highlighters and I feel
like they will show up on all sorts of
different skin tones no matter what skin
tone you have these will work for you if
you are fairer than I am I'm between an
NC ten and fifteen when I'm not self
tanned I would go ahead and go with the
G way because I feel like that one does
have that white base so it's not going
to darken up on your skin but if you
just have like my color skin or anything
deeper I do think that the rose quartz
is going to show up and be very very
beautiful on you so I feel like they're
technically sort of the same price you
do get double the product in the Becca
but it's half the price kind of you guys
know what I mean I would say the one
that I would personally repurchase would
be both of them I like both of them I
think they're very different they have
very different formulations I like the
way that this one glides onto the skin
it does require a little bit of buffing
into the skin a little more of like a
buffing brush to apply it whereas the
Becca just goes on with anything like a
sigma tapered highlighter brush whatever
you want to use but I think for the most
part they are sort of similar but not
really when you put them in the direct
light they look kind of similar but you
can tell this one's definitely a lot
more pinky tones this one has that more
rosy color to it but it's more cool
toned and it's got that white base so
definitely not the same sort of color
going on here if you know that you love
baked chili formulations like I
do you would absolutely adore this it
builds up on the skin really really
nicely and I do prefer it just a little
bit more than the Becca but I still
think the Becca is extremely pigmented
and if you're in a hurry and you just
want to put it on quickly I think this
one is the one you should go with so
anyway that's my little comparison I
feel like price-wise they're about the
same cents this is half the size if they
had double the size it would be about
the same price as this one I feel like
they both go on to the skin nicely they
don't have to emphasize that much
texture and I feel like as far as
building up the product is concerned
there's you a does it better but for the
most part they're gorgeous on the skin
and if you were looking for a good pink
highlight I highly recommend checking
those out so I hope you enjoyed this
video guys thank you so much for joining
me and I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
