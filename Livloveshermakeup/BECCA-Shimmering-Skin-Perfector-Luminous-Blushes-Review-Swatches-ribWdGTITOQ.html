channel in this video I am giving you
guys a review and I also have so much is
here of the new Becca shimmering skin
perfecter luminous blushes in the shade
Snapdragon and Tiger Lily I purchased
these for $34 on the Sephora calm
website and I will link below in the
description bar where you guys can pick
them up if you are interested currently
they have two shades that are like
available for VIP and VIP Rouge
exclusive members and also this is a
Sephora exclusive product so you won't
be able to find this on the Beckham
website so the shades that are available
right now are Snapdragon which is a deep
coral and also Tiger Lily which is a
gorgeous like tangerine color and then
in April 2016 they will have blushed
copper available camellia which is a
ballerina pink fox Club which is an
orchid shade and then Dalia which is a
Cabernet shade so I'm really excited
because so far I am loving these babies
they are beautiful and I just think some
of the most they really are some of the
most unique blushes like in colors that
I've ever seen in my life so this is
what the packaging looks like typical
Becca it's just a really really dark
kind of cool toned dark chocolatey Brown
matte color and I'm gonna read a little
bit about what it says about the product
on the back of the box it says these are
inspired by Becca's best-selling
shimmering skin Perfector press which
are they're gorgeous gorgeous highlights
that everybody raves about it says these
lustrous blushes create a flush of
radiant color any range of delicate
feminine shades where it's on its own or
as they blush copper to add dimension to
any look so they kind of like talked
about this being a blush topper I
honestly just don't understand how it
could be because these are the swatches
right here the one on the top is called
Tiger Lily which is that gorgeous kind
of tangerine shade and then we have
Snapdragon right here I am wearing Tiger
Lily on my cheeks today and that is the
only product to have on my cheeks they
don't have bronzer I don't have
highlight anything like that but these
are supposed to be like a blush topper
they are so pigmented I don't think
they're gonna work like that but I was
talking to my friend Amy who told me
that the original formulation of blush
is from becca is very heavily pigmented
so i guess that these kind of are a
lighter version of the blush but i still
think these are very pigmented this is
just with one swipe no primer
and I feel like these are very pigmented
but overall I think they're absolutely
lovely they have a gorgeous Sheen to
them this shape right here that's called
Tiger Lily by the way this is the outer
packaging it is the same size as the
other blushes that they have which is
six grams or 0.2 ounces Tiger Lillies
Tiger Lily is a gorgeous gorgeous dark
kind of tangerine color with tons and
tons of golden shimmer in it and then we
have Snapdragon which is my favorite
it's probably the one I should've worn
today it's a deep dark coral shade and I
don't have anything like this in my
collection it's just absolutely stunning
and this one also has a gorgeous gold
iridescent to it so they are very
buttery very very pigmented I do notice
when I push my brush in there there is
quite a bit of kick up or fallout that
comes up and I think that's because they
are so buttery and soft they're not as
soft and buttery as the highlighters if
you're wondering they're not but they
are incredibly pigmented and beautiful
and I love the sheen that they leave on
my cheeks I would say the wear time is
really really good especially if you're
using a primer and a setting spray they
will last absolutely all day long and I
just love the sheen that they give to
the cheeks I will say you want to use
something that is kind of densely packed
and probably angled on you could use an
angled brush like this which is the luxe
e5o for large angled brush and you or
you can use something like the elf small
stipple brush something that will get
right onto the apple of the cheek that
you can bring up towards the cheekbone
because honestly if you take like a big
fluffy brush with these like they are
going to get all over your face because
they are so creamy and smooth they
really really blend easily and you just
don't want that all over your face
because they still are very highly
pigmented as well so I highly recommend
using something that's kind of small and
dense and just packing it on that area
and then you can kind of buff it into
the skin I just love the way that these
look on the skin I think they're
absolutely beautiful and I can't wait to
pick up the other ones so overall I
think these are fantastic and you don't
get as much product in here as you do
with the highlighters
I guess that these are the same size as
the original blushes I personally didn't
know that I've never tried the original
blushes out so I actually didn't know
like what size they were but when I
opened it up I was surprised at how
small they were however I feel like a
little goes a long way with these so $34
is a very very good price so overall I
know this is a quick little review I
can't wreck
these more like literally they're
they're amazing they're really really
beautiful and amazing and I just think
there's such unique different gorgeous
colors like I don't have any color like
that that orange color maybe like mixes
cinnamon but it doesn't have that Sheen
in it you know these are basically a
blush and highlighter built into one and
the colors that they came out with are
just so damn unique like amazing so
overall I highly highly recommend going
in stores watching these checking them
out they're beautiful beautiful shades I
think you're going to love the formula
if you do want to use them as they blush
topper I recommend going very very
lightly on the cheeks because these are
highly pigmented but yeah I just cannot
recommend them enough they are
absolutely beautiful and I cannot wait
for the other four shades to release so
thank you so much for joining me for
this quick little review and I will see
you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
