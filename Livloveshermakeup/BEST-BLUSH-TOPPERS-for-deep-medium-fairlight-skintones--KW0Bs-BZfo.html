video for you tonight at this time we
are talking about the best blush toppers
for deep skin tones medium skin tones
and my skin tone which is fair to light
so if you are curious of what is a blush
topper it's something that I talk about
all the time and I know that it goes
around YouTube all the time what I
consider it to be is technically a
highlighter that is darker than my skin
tone or a blush that doesn't really have
enough pigment so that you want to put
it on top of another blush so I usually
will put my regular blush on and then
sometimes I will reach for a blush
topper and I'm gonna share with you guys
the ones that I like so let's go ahead
and get started but we are gonna start
with you fear to light category and the
first one I want to recommend hmm by the
way you guys if I'm clearing my throat
it's because mr. bata is spending the
next two weeks with me in the Beauty
room and he is made at my throat so
itchy today I'm slightly allergic so
he's in here while we have guests but
the first one is from L'Oreal and this
is the invisible lift color lift blush
in the shade rose gold now I always talk
about this and say it's one of my
all-time favorite blushes but really
it's just one of my all-time favorites
blush toppers it doesn't have a lot of
pigment to it even though it is
considered a blush if you really want to
work this onto your cheeks you have to
really really build a lot of layers and
unfortunately there's more shimmer in
here than pigment so there's more gold
than Rose so the second that you really
start building it up on your cheeks it
actually looks super metallus eyes like
you just put highlighter on your cheeks
which is not very cute so I really like
to use this as a blush topper I'll show
you guys a quick swatch so you can see
the kind of pigment level that I'm
talking about it's just perfect for
stippling on top of a powder product or
another cream product beautiful highly
highly recommend that they said what I
want to talk about is from Clinique this
is the uplighting illuminating powder in
the shade zero one nude glow this is the
lightest out of three that they released
I believe they still have three this is
what it looks like it's very similar to
the hourglass ambient lighting powder in
the shade dim light and I really like to
buff out my blush with this does that
make sense so it's kind of like a blush
topper but also it helps with harsh
lines and just making sure that
everything looks smooth on the skin so I
really really like this and if you are
fair complected this is a beautiful
beautiful powder for that let's see here
another one that is a really good
example of this
the fireball afterglow a dark powder
highlighter from urban decay so this is
a highlighter they did release three
different shades the first one was
called aura which is beautiful they also
have sin which is kind of like a
champagne color and then they released
this one for deeper skin tones well you
can still use this as a blush topper if
you do have a fair complexion this is
the shade of fireball and it is a nice
peachy color with a little bit of like a
lilac iridescent running through it I
can really really try and build it up to
be an actual blush but it gets a little
too shimmery looking so it's the perfect
example of a blush topper and if you
guys are curious I really like to use
fluffy big brushes when I go in I wanna
say blushes puffy fluffy big brushes
when I go in for blush toppers just so
that I'm not distributing too much
pigment so I really enjoy that one and
this little guy here from makeup
revolution is great as well these go on
very very high impact if you do foil
them but when you don't they actually
are very subdued and just kind of mellow
looking on the skin this is the vivid
baked blush in the shade make love
instead and it looks a little something
like this
it has a really really nice kind of
peachy undertone to it and the shimmer
is very very finely milled so again look
is beautiful on top of any sort of peach
or coral blush another one that is great
from the drugstore is the hard candy
baked a bronzer in the shade of cheeky
and forget what that's called
it is a baked bronzer but technically
it's like light enough to be a highlight
on most skin tones it can almost be a
highlight on my particular skin tone
however if I go a little too
heavy-handed with this you can see a
line of like gold or yellow so if you do
have like a darker highlight that is in
the golden or yellow category and you do
have a fair complexion think about maybe
just taking a little bit with a fan
brush and dusting it onto the apples of
your cheeks and just kind of going
backwards and basically you will
distribute it on top of a really nice
pigmented blush and it will give you a
really nice glow without being too like
wham bam in your face so this is another
really really good one and then at the
last one I want to recommend for fair to
light complexions is the Too Faced
sweethearts perfect flush blush in the
shade candy glow I feel like these
blushes are a really good example of
blush toppers you get three different
shades in here as you guys can see and
you really can choose whatever you want
to pick up I usually just dust my whole
brush in there and I will go over
another blush
with this yes I go over another blush
with this because these are not ultra
ultra pigmented they are not like the
new formulation the 16-hour powder
blushes they are nothing like that they
don't stay on as long as that and these
actually do have a little bit of I guess
you could say micro glitter in them so
they don't actually look flattering when
you really really build it up on the
skin because you're getting chunks of
glitter so what I recommend is using
just a pigmented blush going in with
this I just scratch myself going in with
this and then dusting it on lightly you
can even concentrate it on your
cheekbones if you don't want it on the
apples of your cheeks but and this is
beautiful for fair to light skin tones
alright let's go ahead and move into the
medium skin tone category the first one
I want to recommend is from Smashbox
this is technically a highlighter but I
believe for medium like complexions this
would be too dark still this is the
fusion soft lights baked starburst
highlighter from Smashbox this is what
it looks like and when you mix
everything together it kind of has this
bronzy hue to it it actually reminds me
a lot of the elf of golden bronzer so
technically kind of like a bronzer shade
you can actually use this probably if
you are fair complected you could use
this as a bronzer but also a beautiful
beautiful blush topper or even a bronzer
topper if you do have medium skin tone
so I love that and I think anybody with
a medium skin tone would love that as
well another really good one is the Wet
n Wild Fergie centerstage collection
this is in the shade Hollywood Boulevard
this is also a blush topper for fair
skin tones as well it looks like it
would be a really golden e color but it
actually has a little bit of a grayish
undertone so if you want to use this as
a bronzer topper that would work as well
but it's very very beautiful just a
little too deep for me and also for
medium complexions I think a little too
deep because I have a friend who has a
straight up medium complexion and this
is too deep on her as well but she does
like to use it just to kind of add a
little life over her blushes so that is
a good recommendation also the Bobbi
Brown's what is the Bobbi Brown
afternoon glow highlighting powder this
is gorgeous gorgeous again fair too
light and also medium complexions this
could technically technically be a blush
topper so I have been a long day
technically be a blush topper it has a
really really nice rose gold appearance
to it so you can just go right over a
blush with this I love
when they have this really nice pinky
undertone because it's just perfect for
topping blushes alright and then the
last sort of one I want to recommend is
a pilot it is the Bobbi Brown Bobbi to
glow shimmer brick palettes this would
work for fair skin tones light/medium
absolutely beautiful this one
technically would be a highlight on
medium complexions but the bronze shade
and then the rose shade definitely are
great great great blush toppers they or
bronzer toppers they do not have enough
pigment to just be the blush topper I
always like to put it on top of another
blush but these are absolutely beautiful
really really highly recommended all
right now let's talk about the deeper
skin tones um I have a friend at work
who has a very very dark chocolatey
beautiful complexion and she helped me
with some of these though
let's go ahead and get started the first
one is from Mac this is the Sun bask
sheer tone of shimmer blush now I don't
talk about Mac very often I don't really
like mac cosmetics I will be doing a
whole video dedicated to the subject
matter but I do think they make good
blushes so the sheer tone formulation
obviously is supposed to be a little
more sheer on the skin I think this
would be a beautiful blush topper if you
do have a very deep complexion and you
want to wear a very very dark almost
ready kind of bronzy color on your skin
this would just be a really nice way to
kind of move and amp it up a little bit
I guess you could say it could even
technically be a highlight on some skin
tones but it's very very beautiful
another one if you are wearing a really
pinky blush is the makeup revolution
vivid baked blush in the shade one for
playing games again this could
technically be a highlight depending on
your skin tone but I think this is
beautiful I did put this on my friend
and she was wearing like a pinky blush
actually we put the Laura Geller
what is this baked swirl gelato
illuminator and not illuminate or blush
in plum berry and then we put this on
top and it just gave a little bit of
extra radiance and it looks so so so
gorgeous on the skin so this has more of
a satiny finish this is obviously more
glowy so the two of those go together
really really nicely and this definitely
shows up on the deepest of skin tones
and then another one of those to plate
to face and perfect flush de blushes is
in the shade there's something about
berry so this is really gorgeous as they
blush topper for darker skin tones like
I said these do have glitter in them so
no matter what skin tone you have you
still will get a lot of glitter if you
try and build this up on your cheeks but
if you are wearing a really
dark pigmented blush like this one and
you want to top it with this for a
little bit of extra Sheen and radiance
this is a great great great option let's
see here another one from Wet n Wild is
the Fergie centerstage collection rose
golden goddess this is gorgeous
I use this as a bronzer but this is the
perfect perfect blush topper or bronzer
topper for those of you with a very deep
complexion and finally the two Becca
luminous blushes these show up as actual
blushes on my skin tone they would for a
medium complexion as well but if you
have a very very dark complexion I think
all of these would be great some of them
have a lot of pigment to them and I just
think that it would work even better for
your skin tone if that makes sense so
these are the luminous blushes in the
shades Tiger Lily
and also Snapdragon Tiger Lily is
gorgeous this would show up on the
deepest of skin tones and here is
Snapdragon which is a really hot coral
shade so anyway guys and that is it
thank you so much for joining me I hope
you enjoyed this video on the best of
blush toppers I really like these and
these are still products I've reached
for I hear a lot of people saying like
oh I'm not really into this you know
these kind of blushes because they're
not very pigmented you definitely can
still use products like that to your
advantage and you know anytime I review
a highlighter that's technically darker
than my skin tone people are like why
are you keeping that I'm like cuz I'll
still use it so anyway I hope you
enjoyed this thank you so much for
joining me guys and I will see you
tomorrow
