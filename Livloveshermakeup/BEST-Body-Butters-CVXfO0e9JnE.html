this is the perfect time to do this the
weather is starting to get cold I tend
to hoard body butters not lotions you
know not body load body butters I don't
know why it's just what I prefer to use
on my body so the first thing I want to
talk about um I got these like literally
only a few days ago but I have already
used every single one of them and they
smell amazing this is my favorite one
the Moringa or Mirena Moringa something
like that and this a to my one is really
great - these are from the body shop I
got like a set up I yeah there's one of
them I've got it for I think $25 on
all-time it was really great deal and
these are amazing I just wanted to show
them quickly I have only been using them
for about a week but they really live up
to the standards
everybody talks about them they really
they smell really good and they're very
moisturizing so the next ones I want to
talk about are from boots um this is the
mango body butter and the coconut body
butter um
body butter is just always smells so
good but these ones are particularly
thick and when I'm really dry I go to
these ones and they just they get the
job done for my you know my elbows or my
knees things like that and I like these
are like travel friendly sizes so and I
think you can get boots and get annoyed
read if you're doing read near you or
Walgreens or something drugstore store
sold at the drugstore I guess next I
guess I'm going through all the little
mini ones um I have only had these for a
couple weeks but I brought these on my
Thanksgiving vacation and these are the
Josie Maran whipped argan oil be
spirited which is a sweet citrus scent
and then the this one's my favorite the
be joyful which is a what is it a
vanilla apricot these are awesome
um even my boyfriend used the vanilla
apricot wine and he was like wow that
smells good and Josie Maran is known for
obviously having that argan oil in all
of her formulas in her lip glosses in
her body treat you know
everything and argan oil is so
nourishing for your hair your skin
everything so yes I found these to be
very very very very nourishing and I
would definitely pick up the full size
in the vanilla apricot one but I would
actually pick them up on both the sense
the citrus one is really nice like
during the day and then the apricot one
is kind of nice to wind down at
nighttime but these are really travel
friendly I like these little ones I
think I got this
deal it was like twenty five dollars or
ten oh my god I don't even know on
Sephora it's part of the holiday
collection thing but those are not like
limited edition cents I know they've
been delayed for how one it's not I
already looked it up
okay the next actress I'm going from
smallest to largest so the next thing I
have here I found a beauty box I think
was my glossy box with you last month
this is by Laura Ashley this is the
coconut line body butter and you guys is
such an interesting formula it's almost
like a gel like it feels like a gel and
sometimes coconut lime scent like it
gets very key you can smell very
unnatural and very synthetic and it
gives me a headache
this one smells real like a coconut and
a line work together this is the real
deal guys and I love the formula it's
almost like you know it is a body butter
um you know so as body butter and it
moisturizes like a body butter but it
feels like a gel going on so it's
actually kind of refreshing so really
really like that one
and they have to pick up a full-size of
that not that I need it these aren't
even all my body butters right I just
picked up the top ones so I have two
more that make the top of my list this
one is the I love strawberries and cream
feel scrumptious with a burst of fresh
strawberries and smooth yummy cream so
this is from the I love brand I picked
this up at ah I was going to say bath
and body wash no Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond this
is like $3 from top of this a huge smell
so good it smells exactly like
strawberries and cream and this one is
more of like a whipped texture it's not
super heavy it's like kind of light and
nice and it really really absorbs into
the skin easily and quickly
I love it now I have to wipe it off I
know that much
I just can't be greasy and touching my
computer also will like explore
something
um but love this and it taking me
forever to go through and like I said it
was like 399 and they have like I love
coconut milk and I love every other
scent in the world but I picked this one
because not a lot of brands have
strawberries and cream scented you know
like the body shop has the strawberry
one which is good but let me tell you if
you're going to get one from the body
shop get this on the Moringa ah so good
or the symptom oh one and the last one
that is a favorite of mine I have
recently become obsessed with this brand
this is the tree nut brand I also get
this at Bed Bath and Beyond I use their
body scrubs now that is the only day I
think I just stuttered that is the only
body scrub I will use now um it's the
best and honestly I'm starting to work
my way like through their line I'm going
to try some other shower gels and
whatnot because I'm really impressed and
I picked up this um body butter uh
smells so good you guys this is almond
done honey scented let me tell you what
this smells like
it smells like amaretto cookies okay
like exactly like I do for them okay and
I just want to show you guys like how
thick this stuff is this is crazy
moisturizing um this is going to leave a
bit of an oily residue um but I would
say out of all of the body letters that
I own not just the ones that I have here
that are my favorites out of all of them
this one gives the best moisture yes it
can be kind of irritating to be a little
greasy but if you're really really dry
and you need relief right away which is
absolutely yet and the set doesn't
irritate me and I think this tub was
like four or five dollars awesome guys
awesome the almond honey scent
especially on our dough cookies yes I'm
right yes
YUM so they basically have every scent -
they of them you know the typical one
shea butter coconut all that stuff but
like this I sometimes like to you know
body butter tend to get like very
repetitive like you get lots of coconut
lots of mango you know whatever so I
like to pick up different things when I
can like coconut lime is different
strawberries and cream um you know this
one the almond and honey which is
actually should be renamed on rent oh
okay smells like that so good but anyway
um those are my favorite body butters I
hope this was helpful um this was like
all different spectrum of prices a body
shop is much more expensive um if you
can get this little deal I would these
are great because then you can pick your
favorite scent um I would say boots is
really affordable these are nice these
are very thick and they absorb quickly
like I said this one is just kind of a
standout like I had no idea who this was
but um I've never heard of this brand
but I like this one it's like that gel
it's almost like a gel and I think that
that's really refreshing and then of
course the Josie Maran
is also expensive I think it's like 50
bucks for a cool side to this but this
is super luxurious guys super luxurious
but then also these two you know you
could get both of these for under
probably 15 bucks at Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond
and you get big big containers and I
like these just as much as I like the
other one so I would go ahead and try um
you know if you're switching from
lotions to body butters you may be
shocked it's very it actually feels
different like I'm serious I am someone
who religiously only uses body butters I
do not use lotions and that's because I
just don't find them moisturized enough
and I like the like feeling up the body
butter better um but what I'm going to
say is that you know start with
something in the drugstore like this
like these three and then if you really
get into it and it's like something you
use daily then go ahead and pick up like
something from the body shop
I got your favorite scent or the Josie
Maran um but if it's just something that
you use once in a while like that is not
me I use these every single night like
that's why I have so many I use these
like lotion which probably isn't good
for my wallet but
ever they just are so much better um but
I would say go ahead and pick up you
know it's good to have these little
trial sizes the boots ones these are
like three bucks you can see if you like
the consistency and if you do we can go
and get higher-end one you don't
necessarily need to because let me tell
you this one smells better than all of
them anyway those are my favorite body
butters maybe I can show you guys my
collection at some point I literally
have like a bucket of them under the
sink which is horrible but these are the
standout ones and I like that they're
all at different price ranges and they
all basically do the same thing I think
that's very cool so I hope you guys
enjoyed this and make sure your skin is
nice and moisturize this winter both
we've got some body butters guys I'm
