iPhone I have like this whole list of
YouTube video ideas that's why I post
them any at a time because I'm like oh
all of these yes I thought of that um
something that was on there was my
favorite cream blushes or not powder
blushes and I thought that was kind of
interesting instead of just doing
oh my favorite blushes you know I think
I did do my top five favorite blushes
but favorite like blushes would take
forever because I'm obsessed with blush
that's the besides I palette blush is my
obsession so um anyway I thought it'd be
interesting to kind of talk about like
mousse you know Lucy ones anything
that's not a power liquid things like
that so let's just get started
um one from the drugstore that I know a
lot of people hate I actually really
like and it's funny because these are
not very pigmented but these are the
Dream bouncy blushes and these are from
Maybelline and I have this one in about
this you know it's worn off this is like
that uh I'm guessing some kind of coral
name and I think this is Hot Tamale
and I think what I like about these is
that you get that Sheen and that happens
a lot with mousse I mean these are kind
of like mossy pillowy textures and I
think to come across blushes like that
and they always have a really beautiful
sheen so I think that's the reason I
like these so much they are not heavily
pigmented you have to work at it for a
while but I think when you're working
with like not powder blushes it's
actually better to do a little at a time
because sometimes if you're wearing like
you know foundation with powder on top
and then you put a cream product on top
of it if you put too much on at once it
can get cakey easily so um I think that
those are actually good and I I do like
them I know a lot of people don't like
them but I do another hmm excuse me um
another thing from the drugstore these
are actually my favorite if I'm gonna
have to say my favorite and you should
go and splurge these are the L'Oreal
visible lift color lift
lushes one is in rose gold and the other
one is in coral lift so this is like
such a unique shade do you see that
guy's rose gold it is so beautiful on
the cheeks and it gives you just that
gorgeous gorgeous Sheen this one is also
nice it's Coralie it doesn't have that
kind of Sheen this is really a special
color I have never found any powder
blush anything that has matched this so
this is definitely one of my favorite
blushes like in general so I love that
if you guys come across that and you
have to pick at the drugstore between
Dream bouncy or this it would cost you
know one of these is basically the price
of two of these unfortunately you guys
go with this one because this is such a
unique shade okay the next one I want to
talk about almost done actually I don't
have a lot of cream blushes my powder
girl now these are kind of I would say
more heavily pigmented and they're
really really glide on really really
easily these are the urban decay what
are these they're just there slide on I
think they're called
afterglow sorry afterglow glide on
blushes so this isn't the color fetish
and I like that that it's got that nice
deep kind of mouth color to it and also
it does have that Sheen and these are
really really just they glide on like
they're really they're they're quite
pigmented and just very very smooth easy
to work with and these are probably the
most pigmented um cream blusher it's my
own actually because they just get that
color on there right away and the other
one I have is indefinite and this is
just like a nudie kind of peachy color I
like it I like this one this is nice on
fair skin tones so I like those um like
I said they are pretty heavily connected
and sometimes they can interrupt if
you're wearing too much powder on your
face like you know I like to overpower
my face I mean I just do and sometimes
it can disrupt like it puts too much on
at a time and then you start to get like
flakiness and weirdness so definitely
apply with a light hand I
commend the small stipple brush from elf
cosmetics but these are nice cute
packaging and the last one I wanted to
talk about is actually something that I
just reviewed today um this is the
Sephora the beauty of giving back face
palette and there are three cream
blushes in here that are absolutely
beautiful and pigmented and wonderful
and they are so so creamy and I would
say like definitely favorites right here
these are the best in the palette for
sure do you see that look at that
pigmentation I love this like cool tone
pink but these are awesome and so let's
just look at those three forget the
other one um so absolutely love these I
like having a blessed palette that has
cream in it you know that's the one
thing that the Amazonian clay one does
not have you know they don't have
different textures are you know what I
mean like of course they have different
textures but they don't have that kind
of variety maybe they'll come out with
something like that that'd be awesome
but um it's fun you know um mousse blush
blush
mousse blushes or glide on blushes or
just non powdered blushes are really
really fun it's gonna scary when you
first start to use them I always thought
I used to wear too much foundation and
that like every time I would put one of
these on like it would just get all but
I was applying it the wrong way I was
applying it with my fingers which was
not right you want to apply it with
something dense like a stipple brush
like the small stipple brush from ELF I
get that um it's really really amazing
for um like the more liquidy brushes I
guess you could say um also um one thing
I wanted to throw out that I want to try
are those elf HD blushes they're like
actual like pump whatever ah I really
like on a no-buy right now for blushes
because you guys these searches you have
not seen all the powder blushes over
here okay I'm looking at them right now
there's too much um I'm on a no buy when
it comes to blush
so I did not get those when I did my
alcohol but it really hurt me because I
saw Emily Noelle do a video on I think
the color diva and
looked amazing and I was like I should
have gotten it but I know I don't need
it but um if you have tried those what's
the formula like is it more like a gel
or how do you apply it I'm curious
because I know in the end I'll end up
probably picking it up so anyway these
are my favorite creating blushes I hope
you guys enjoyed this video I hope it
was helpful see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
