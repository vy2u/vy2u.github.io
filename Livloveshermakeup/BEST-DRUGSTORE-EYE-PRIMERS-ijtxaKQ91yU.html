channel thank you so much for joining me
I hope you are all having a fantastic
day in today's video we are talking
about the best drugstore eye primers and
I'm really really excited I've been
meaning to film this video for quite
some time now it's been on my list for a
while and of course I just want to say
really quickly these are just my
opinions I love hearing your thoughts
and comments down below in the comment
section so let me know if you have tried
any of the primers that I'm gonna share
with you guys let me know first of all
if they worked for you if they didn't
work for you and also I want to know if
you have some good drugstore primer
recommendations so let's go ahead and
get started the first one I want to talk
about I actually don't have currently I
literally just used up the last little
bit in my tube I think you guys will see
it it was either in last month's empties
or this month empties video which will
be up probably sometime next week
anyway it is the Milani eye primer I
think that is such a wonderful wonderful
eye primer it's really really beautiful
and I feel like for the price you really
just can't beat it so that is the first
one the second one I want to talk about
is the elf eyelid primer so this is one
of those primers that I feel like people
either hate or they love like there is
no in-between with this particular
primer it reminds me a little bit of the
Milani but the Milani has a little more
of a tacky base so if you do have really
really oily eyelids I would highly
recommend the Milani I feel like the elf
one I personally have sort of
combination skin in combination eyelid
so my eyelids tend to get a little more
rough and textured during the winter and
cooler months and then during the spring
and summertime they get really frickin
oily and I just feel like this
particular primer holds up really nicely
all year long for the Milani I usually
like to wear that during the summertime
I don't really like it during the winter
because it does it does tend to start to
like emphasize some texture on my
eyelids but this particular one the elf
eyelid primer I can wear all year long
you have a little doe foot applicator
here and the shade that I have is sheer
and I think this is like 1 or 3 dollars
um the name has completely worn off on
this this has just been a repurchase for
me over and over and over again
recommend at least trying it out and
like I said people either love it or
they hate it if it doesn't work for you
it's only 1 or 3 dollars if it does work
you than that's fantastic
here it is on the back of my hand and I
like the way it goes on it has the
perfect amount of tackiness and the
perfect amount of like smoothness to the
point where you could blend your
eyeshadows out really really nicely so I
really do it like that product the next
one I want to talk about is the
Maybelline master prime long-lasting
eyeshadow base the shade I have is 5/10
and I actually have not talked about
this too much I think recently or ever
on my channel and the reason for that is
because I need to have a lot of time
with like an eye primer before I decide
if I love it so I really like this one
they have many different shades of this
I believe they have 5 10 which is the
lightest the one I have they have 515
520 and 525 I believe so no matter what
your skin tone is you can get one that
pretty much will match you this one has
a little bit of a topi pinky iridescent
to it and I love this during the cooler
months because it does have a little bit
of Sheen to it and you wouldn't think
it's weird but I love um like pairing
this with my matte shadows I don't know
why but sometimes I have matte shadows
that are very very dusty and sort of
chalky looking and if I have this as a
base and then I put those on top it
still appears matte on my eyes except it
has like a little bit of like I don't
even want to say shade or luminosity it
just makes it look like it's not
completely dry and ashy like the shadows
aren't so I personally really really
enjoyed this eye primer I would highly
recommend checking it out it has a
beautiful little doe foot applicator
that is super super soft and cushiony on
each side and let me show you guys what
it looks like so there it is and like I
said I do prefer this one during the
cooler months just because I feel like
when my eyelids are a little more crispy
oh I feel like this definitely helps to
kind of make them look a little more
dewy
alright even moving on the next eye
primer I want to talk about is the NYX
eyeshadow base in the shade white so
they have quite a few of these I believe
they have sort of like a neutral one
which I have tried the reason I like
this
so much is because I like to use this
when I'm using really really bright
colors it is stark white and it is a
very very humectant and creamy I do not
wear this during the summer time because
it literally will just like it it will
go right off my eyelids if I do want to
wear it during the summer time I would
pair it with like the elf primer and
then go in with this on top just so that
I can make sure that the shadows really
really pop but it is just straight up
stark white and it will make any sort of
shadow that you put on top of it it will
just make it look that much brighter and
amazing and brilliant so anyway that I
thought it looks like it's really lovely
has a little bit of a I guess when you
put it on it feels a little slippery and
then it kind of turns into a tacky base
but I personally really really like that
if you have super super dark skin you
can mix it together with the the medium
toned one I believe have a dark one too
I don't know but I really personally
like the lightest one just because I
feel like it makes all of the colors pop
on my eyes alright and the next one I
want to talk about is the L'Oreal magic
decrease eye primer I really really like
this little guy I have been using him
all week and you guys will see in my
look of the week on Saturday I'll be
using at this little guy as well the
shade I have is called 895 and it pulled
a little bit of a peachy salmony yellow
tone and I really like it because it
does kind of color correct my eyelids
but it does completely blend into your
skin at the end of the day if that makes
sense so it's not going to leave some
weird like a yellowy color on your skin
it just completely blends in I really
like the amount of tackiness that it has
it reminds me a lot of the elf eyelid
primer and I do like the consistence the
concent the consistency of that where
it's kind of tacky but it's still
blendable so not too slippery but also
not too tacky so really really like
those and I do want to say really
quickly as far as creasing is concerned
I have never found a perfect eye primer
drugstore or otherwise hi ed whatever
I've never found one that completely
completely helps with creasing on my
eyelid so I'm not saying that these are
going to really really help with
creasing even though this is called the
magic decrease I am wearing it
on my eyes and I don't feel like my eye
shadow is creasing really really
horribly I'm actually filming this at
the end of the day after work so I feel
like my eye makeup has held up
relatively well but for the most part I
just have not found a perfect primer for
creasing if that makes sense but all of
the primers that I'm showing you guys
really really do help to make the colors
pop on your eyes and also they help them
just to stay in place all day long
alright and then the last I prime Iran
to talk about is actually a technically
a high-end brand this is the bones put a
lid on it
eyelid primer now the reason I consider
the balm drugstore is because I do not
buy the balm products on the Bob comm
website I only purchase them on
HauteLook so I get them for fifty to
seventy-five percent off when I purchase
them so this particular eyelid primer I
believe on the regular of the balm
website is $18 I got this for nine
dollars which I consider drugstore so I
just wanted to throw it in here if you
do see this on HauteLook I'd highly
recommend picking it up when I was doing
my makeup collection video I was showing
all of my bone stuff as like you know
drugstore basically and the reason for
that is because I've never paid full
price for like the mary lou manizer or
the eyeshadow palettes like they're all
relatively cheap when you do buy them on
whole look so anyway I don't consider
the balm to be if you purchase them on
the balms website I don't consider them
to be drugstore but if you do get them
from Haute look this is drugstore price
so anyway this is also a really really
nice eyelid primer this reminds me a lot
of the Urban Decay what is it called the
one with retinol and it's the Urban
Decay anti-aging primer it has a lot of
slip to it and it's basically just like
a genetic own super super slippery
primer and if you do have a lot of
creasing on your eyelids or just a lot
of wrinkles and very very like dry
eyelids I think you would absolutely
love this it does not get tacky
whatsoever so it really glides onto the
eye area very very nicely and it really
does remind me of that urban decay um
what is it caller did not remember this
name the Urban Decay anti-aging primer
whatever it is the one with a little bit
of retinol in it so and that really
reminds me of that and then I do have
i'ma hire and um or like you know yeah
hi and like it not to be hi and I
primers that I want to share with you
guys that are very similar to some other
drugstore ones that I showed you so if
you do like any of these like a lot you
could go ahead and get to the drugstore
alternative next time because trust me
once I get through all of my high end
primers I'm probably not going to be
repurchasing them anymore because
there's so many good drugstore eye
primers that you can pick up for so much
cheaper so anyway the first one I want
to talk about is the Too Faced shadow
insurance glitter glue now I did not
talk about the dupe for this product but
an exact dupe for it is the alpha
glitter glue and that's like three
dollars it's amazing I have to order it
on the AL comm website because I can
never find it in Target but literally
same exact consistency really really
helps shadows to adhere really really
nicely on the eyes it's a very very
tacky base so if you do want to work
with like loose pigments and glitter
this is a really really good one and so
is the elf glitter glue and then the
stay don't stray from benefit this is a
very very similar to the L'Oreal magic
decrease so if you really like this guy
and you want a cheaper alternative I
highly recommend checking out the
L'Oreal decrease and then the last one
is the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer
potion just in the regular form the
Milani eyeshadow primer is pretty much
an exact dupe for this also and is
somewhat similar to the elf eyelid
primer not exactly this one definitely
has a little more of a tacky base I
would say the Milani is definitely more
of a do for it but this one is also
pretty similar and then like I said for
the balm this is definitely a dupe if
you get it oh look it's definitely a
dupe for the Urban Decay anti-aging
primer so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video thank you so much for joining me
and I will see you guys tomorrow
for the review final aeon of the makeup
forever festival faves I line our kids
are you guys I will see you then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
