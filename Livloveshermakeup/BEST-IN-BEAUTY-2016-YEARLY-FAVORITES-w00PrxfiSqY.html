happy wednesday today's video is going
to be my 2016 best in beauty if you
don't know what that is this is where I
share with you guys my yearly favourites
yes my yearly favourites not just my
weekly favorites yearly so these are
gonna be the products that have just
really been impressing the hell out of
me in 2016 so let's go ahead and jump
right into it and the first item I want
to start with is actually a deodorant
this year I discovered the LA vanilla
brand and I'm absolutely in love I
really wanted to get away from using
deodorants that had aluminum in them
just because my lupus doctor and my
rheumatologist actually told me that the
aluminum is not good for my immune
system so I switched to the la vanilla
brand this one right here is called pure
vanilla these work really really well it
does take some getting used to because
they're not an antiperspirant so they
don't help you from sweating but they do
help you from smelling bad throughout
the day and I would rather be like
sweating than have be oh if that makes
sense so that is the first yearly
favorite the second girly favorite is
definitely my josie maran vibrancy
foundation fluid it was almost a year
ago that I discovered this for the first
time the shade that I wear is dynamic
and if you guys are curious as they go
throughout this video I am wearing the
products that I'm talking about on my
face today so I do have this on my face
today I have two pumps of it on I
applied it with a damp sponge it is so
beautiful so hydrating perfect for me if
I want full coverage during the winter
time so that is definitely foundation of
the year hands down as far as like a
lighter foundation is concerned so more
of almost like a BB cream I've really
been enjoying at my Smashbox camera
ready BB water drops these do have SPF
30 in them and the shade that I wear is
called fair this has just been like my
go-to water foundation or serum
foundation so I guess this is kind of
like my second favorite foundation of
the year it's very beautiful very
lightweight and I board this a lot
during the summer time I also have been
loving these two skin care oils right
here for sure these Sunday Riley UFO oil
this is the ultra clarifying face oil
and also these sleeping at night oil
this is Luna so this is a retinoid oil
and this one right here has salicylic
acid in it and is the dry oil these are
both extremely extremely beautiful I
love all the products from Sunday Riley
that I picked up I really do like the
Martian mattifying of melting water gel
toner or whatever it's called the goes
along with this and I do
the lactic acid treatment the good genes
but I have to say the oils are hands
down what has been impressing me the
most the UFO is great if you do have
oily or problematic acne prone skin and
then they Luna is great for pretty much
everyone except for sensitive skin so
I've really really been enjoying those I
feel like I just saw an immediate
difference in my skin after using those
like consecutively for a week so that is
hands-down amazing I also have been of
course loving my Peter Thomas Roth
unwrinkled peel pads if these made it
into the best of beauty last year for
2016 I don't think I did a makeup
version but I did a skincare version
these have a 20% acid complex the
glycolic salicylic and lactic acids in
it I love these these are the reason why
I think my skin isn't as congested as it
usually is so I used one of these every
single night before I put my mask on and
they are just absolutely amazing as far
as eye primer is concerned hand downs
hands down hand down hands down my
Maybelline master prime long-lasting
eyeshadow base in the shade 510 is the
best eyeshadow primer I've ever used
I love it it has a really nice satiny
consistency to it it helps with creasing
it keeps my eyeshadow on all day I just
want to find a dupe for it that is
cruelty free so if you know of any let
me know I also have been loving on my
Maybelline instant age rewind a dark
circle eraser treatment I had this was
probably in the video last year as well
again I can't remember if I did makeup I
think I only did skincare but this would
have been in last year's video as well
it is absolutely beautiful I feel like
my skin just looks so much better when
I'm wearing this I don't know what the
deal is but it's absolutely beautiful to
shade that I wear is called brightener
which is like the pink one can I say
absolutely beautiful and anymore but
really guys it's a very good product so
I've been really enjoying that as far as
color correcting is concerned it will
probably come as no surprise to you guys
that my Urban Decay Naked skin color
correcting fluids are kind of my kit
product as far as color correcting is
concerned I own all five of them this
particular one right here is called
lavender which is really nice for
brightening up so lowness in the skin
but my favorite one is pink so I really
love these these are discovered probably
about a year ago as well so they are
really good products I also have been
loving my hourglass ambient strobe
lighting powders this particular shade
right here is called incandescent light
I am one of those people that on a
day-to-day basis I don't wear super
super like Twiggy makeup
I don't do a full-face I mean I do a
full face of makeup but I'm not super
super heavy-handed so these are very
very nice very lightweight beautiful
beautiful powders for highlighting they
definitely can give you that built up
like in your face kind of highlight but
at the same time they still look really
really natural on the skin so these have
definitely been favorites as far as this
year is concerned a powder that I have
been using religiously is the elf tone
correcting powder in cool this is what
it looks like I absolutely adore this
for setting in my face makeup it is what
I am wearing today I have already hit
pan on this one and I only got it a few
weeks ago if you do have a cool
undertone this is just so finely milled
and good I don't feel like I need to go
and purchase a high-end powder when I
can set my face in it with a three
dollar one that is absolutely fantastic
alright four mascaras definitely my
Lancome Hypnose drama and my Sephora
outrageous curl mascara I'm wearing the
outrageous curl today on my lashes I
love the way the wand looks on this and
it really gets into all the tiny little
lashes that you have on the inner corner
of your eye and also on the outer part
of your eye it's a beautiful little wand
and I feel like not a lot of people
would check out the Sephora outrageous
Crowell collection or just like the
Sephora collection in general I feel
like it's kind of one of those things
that you kind of walk by but honestly
they have some really fantastic items
another item that I absolutely love from
Lisa for a collection are their wipes
you guys know I love the rose ones but
these ones are they use ooh these are
also really really fantastic as far as
the Lancome Hypnose drama Lancome
Hypnose drama is concerned this is a
beautiful beautiful wet formulation it
has a really really nice wand and I just
feel like it gives me a lot of volume so
really have been enjoying that I do have
a BB cream here that I would say is
probably my favorite for the year this
is the covergirl clean and massive BB
cream so this reminds me more of a
foundation but if there is any BB cream
that I reach for the most it's this one
and also the Smashbox the shade that I
wear is called 510 fair it's for oily
skin it would only recommend for those
of you who do have combination to oily
skin I like to mix a few drops of oil in
it if I am wearing it during this time
of year but during the summer this was
amazing it's got really really full
coverage I like the shade match I feel
like it gives just a beautiful finish to
the skin so this is something that I
really have been enjoying also is
something that's relatively new to me is
the Kat Von D locket concealer creme the
new version in the shade whiteout and
this has completely changed my conceal
damn I feel like I can mix this with any
sort of concealer that maybe is a little
too dark for me or even I can wear this
on its own I am that pale okay so I can
actually put this underneath my eyes it
blends out incredibly incredibly well it
is a very thick um kind of consistency
it has a lot of coverage to it but at
the same time it blends out freakishly
quickly so I really like this I feel
like this is a pale girl must have I
also have been loving of course my
clarence instant light lip comfort oil I
feel like this was the year of lip oils
for me lip oils kind of came in and
we're like trending and I love this
trend I am a lip oil kind of girl I
realized this year I don't like
uncomfortable lip products I don't like
liquid lipsticks I don't like stuff like
that I like lip aisles so yes this
Clarins one is really really good the
shade that I have here is 0-2 raspberry
and then of course the lip product I'm
wearing right now is my yl the left
teens in oil in the shade cherry I'm
Ashley this is what it looks like
another lip oil absolutely beautiful it
smells really good
it can be a little overpowering I didn't
really think about that for people who
are sensitive to scent these are kind of
overpowering but this one smells like
watermelon it is absolutely stunning if
you just want a comfortable lip product
but you want a little bit of color and a
little bit of something that will leave
a stain behind this is a wonderful
wonderful lip product as far as face
primer is concerned hands down my it
cosmetics feel the moment what is this
called anti-aging ultra hydrating since
were your beginning primer serum this is
absolutely amazing this is what I have
on today I put this on my skin today and
I just feel like my skin goes oh like
what I'm gonna die I mean honestly if
you have really tight skin during the
winter time where you get a little dry
and things like that
you just slathered this on your face it
is actually a primer built in with
skincare benefits which is why I like it
cosmetics so much but this is beautiful
a little goes a very very long way it is
definitely worth the splurge this is a
fantastic product for bronzer definitely
my Physicians Formula boro boro butter
bronzer discovered this this year it is
absolutely incredible
it smells amazing just like coconuts my
favorite shade is called a bronzer I do
also have the light bronzer shade which
is a little more warm toned but these
are just absolutely stunning I have
never used such a good bronzer
alright I do have a product here from
Rapid brow so this is something that I
put on my eyebrows at night
time now I don't have naturally really
full eyebrows but I will say I noticed
that they are a lot healthier when I'm
using this they don't fall out as much
and I don't have as much issues
especially when I do have a lupus flare
when I'm using this so I just go ahead
and run this through my eyebrows at
nighttime it doesn't help to like make
new eyebrows like grow or new hairs grow
but it does help to condition the ones
that you already have so that is
something that has definitely been a
yearly favorite also of course a miser
leak or rose water balancing mist you
guys know I'm obsessed with this stuff
it is beautiful it is perfect if you do
have combination or oily skin it really
does balance your skin but it hydrates
just enough of course my essence all
about Matt fixing compact powder you
guys know this is one of my all-time
favorite setting powders along with that
elf tone correcting powder in cool this
is beautiful you can get it for about
what $2.99 399 at Ulta so I love that
and something else that I actually
discovered this year that I really have
been loving is the maybelline superstay
better skin skin transforming powder the
shade that I wear is number 10 at
porcelain this is a really nice finely
milled powder I have been using this
more as a finishing powder but also you
can use it to set in your whole entire
face this is what I'm going to take on
my trip when I am gone for Christmas to
set in my whole entire face it's
beautiful very finely milled you really
like that a lot reminds me a lot of the
it cosmetics abide by pores which again
is another favorite also the Elizabeth
and James Nirvana bourbon perfume the
only thing I don't like about this is
the fact that it doesn't last very long
on the body but this is an amazing
amazing scent this is all I have been
wearing since I got it and I got this
about three months ago and I don't know
this is just the best smelling perfume I
bought this year yeah I love it this is
so if I had gotten this even a year ago
probably would have been the thing that
I wore like throughout the whole entire
year it's a gorgeous gorgeous scent
really enjoy that my car go cosmetics a
lash activator gel night serum this is
what it looks like this is basically
just a lash enhancing product so it
helps to maintain what you already have
and also helps to grow your lashes
condition them it has a little mascara
wand so it's not one of those that
you're actually putting on the skin
underneath your eyes which I like
sometimes I can irritate your actual
eyes this is beautiful my lashes never
used to look like this okay I know a lot
of you give me compliments but one of
the
since why they look so good is because
of this so I love that I got that for
about $25 at Ulta I have also been
loving my Korres what is this vitamin C
active brightening oil this has been my
go-to oil this year it's beautiful meant
for those who do have combination to
oily skin it won't be hydrating enough
if you do have more dry skin but it's
absolutely fantastic mask of the year
definitely is my row stem cell bio
repair gel mask from Peter Thomas Roth
at first I thought oh is it a glam glow
mask but then I realize no it's this
this is the fourth container I've gone
through this year Callie yeah fourth so
that's just goes to show that I really
do love it it's a beautiful really nice
thick gel you apply a thick layer all
over your face you can even put it in
the refrigerator before you put it on
it's gorgeous on the skin and it smells
like rose which I love
as far as brow product is concerned
definitely my Maybelline brow drop brow
drama bit but Brown drama prim Brad
drama grandpa made guys this is what it
looks like I use this pretty much every
single week during look of the week I do
need to sharpen it I can't even remember
if this came with a sharpener just this
come with the sharpener anyway the shape
that I wear is like the lightest one
it's either like an ashy color or a
blonde color it's beautiful this fills
in your brows so so so quickly it's what
I'm wearing today absolutely adore I've
been using that all the time something
that I got exactly a year ago was my
Dior glowing skin you're new to your
glowing gardens glowing pink highlight
so this is amazing it is by far my
favorite highlight too besides the
drugstore one I'm going to show you guys
that I'm wearing on my face today and
also the hourglass one this is what it
looks like it is a beautiful beautiful
cool toned pink iridescent color it does
have a little bit of a white undertone
it's stunning on fair skin so I love
that
another concealer I've been loving this
year is my Tarte reinforce of DC aqua
sealer I really love light weight
concealers and I feel like this is very
lightweight this is what I'm wearing
underneath my eyes today it's beautiful
the only thing I don't like about it the
shade that I wear is fair by the way the
only thing I don't like about it is that
it smells like paint and the actual
applicator is very very big but it is
beautiful I love the way that it sits
underneath the eyes they highlight I'm
wearing today is the makeup revolution
vivid baked I later in the shade of
golden lights this has been at my most
reach for a drugstore highlighter of the
year it is absolutely beautiful I did
declutter the pink light version and I
was
the I think it was called purple lights
no maybe it was called peach lights and
something else pink lights and peach
lights a highlighter from the brand
because it just doesn't have the same
formulation as the golden lights if you
want to get one of these get the golden
Lights version it's amazing love the
highlight it looks amazing and very very
glowy as far as eyeliners are concerned
hands down I have been reaching for my
Smashbox always share four waterproof
Kohl liners this year you guys know I'm
obsessed with the urban decay 24/7
glide-on eye pencils but these really
have been coming out on top so I have
these shade storm right here this one is
Sumatra and then this one is called
Raven I have Raven on right now love
that
as far as blush is concerned my Too
Faced Love flush 16-hour blushes are my
favorite my favorite shade is this one
right here which is called a love
hangover it is a beautiful warm toned
kind of peachy pinky color it's just
amazing on the skin these have a really
really beautiful finish and I have been
loving those for face palette of the
year definitely the Jacqueline Hale
Becca champagne collection face palette
has been my favorite I am wearing this
blush right here called Pomplamoose
today onto my cheeks I think this is
just perfection you get two different
highlights you get a luminous flush
blush and then two matte or satin II
kind of blushes it's amazing this was
definitely worth the money the best
product that they dropped from the
collection in my opinion and then let's
go ahead and talk about eyes shadow
palettes my first one that I have been
loving this year is my Too Faced natural
matte eyeshadow collection it is the 9
pan palette from Too Faced this is my
favorite formulation that they release I
like these more than the chocolate bar
palette and this is what it looks like I
find myself reaching for this all the
time if I just need a transition shade a
nice brow bone shaved whatever I reach
for this a lot I also this year had
discovered the violet Voss brand and I
love their eyeshadow palettes now a lot
of people don't but you know what they
work for me the one that I have right
here to show you guys is called a
drenched metal and it is absolutely
beautiful they also have the Laura Lee
collaboration and also the Holy Grail
palette but this one is absolutely
stunning as you guys can see really like
the foiled consistency in there they're
very very pigmented and very very shiny
and finally the eyeshadow palette that I
really really was impressed with this
year was the modern or renaissance from
anastasia beverly hills i currently have
this in one of my giveaways or in my
open giveaway right now because it is
just so good and even if we're not even
looking at
color selection the actual formulation
of this just blew me out of the park
honestly it's absolutely amazing you do
get a little bit of like powder eNOS
when you put your brush in there but I
think we can all agree that the
formulation and pigmentation in this
palette is absolutely incredible so I
have been loving that alright guys so
those are all of my favourites for the
year I hope you enjoy this definitely

favorites for the year have been I'm
