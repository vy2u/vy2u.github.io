welcome back to my channel today I am
walking you guys through my favorite
Holy Grail products of the year there
are only two categories that I am
leaving out - the first one is makeup
brushes because I will be doing a
dedicated video all about my favorite
makeup brushes very soon for you guys
and the second one is haircare if you
guys didn't know I do suffer from lupus
and this past year I was any lupus trial
and I was left with severe scarring on
the back of my scalp so I have not been
able to use any of my haircare products
I actually have a prescription-strength
eye conditioner and shampoo that I use
and then a few oils here and there but
that's really all I can use on my hair
so I'm not gonna be recommending any
haircare products as I really haven't
tried that much this year but I have a
lot of makeup I have a lot of skincare a
lot of good stuff so anyway let's go
ahead and just jump right into it I want
to start with my favorite primer of the
year and that has been the it cosmetics
field the moment anti-aging ultra
hydrating sensory bikini primer serum
this is what it looks like it is a
beautiful beautiful primer you guys I
love this um earlier in the year when I
was on my lupus trial I was taking
medications that were making a lot of
like sebum come out of my skin so I was
very very kind of combo oily skin dat
now I'm down in the desert and I'm done
with my lupus trial and my skin is very
dry and this works for me all over the
place I think the only people that
wouldn't like this are those who have
more sensitive skin because it does have
quite a bit of fragrance to it and also
those who are extremely extremely oily
like if you're the oiliest of the
aurelius you may not love this because
it does have a very silicone like kind
of thickness to it but it's very
hydrating it's very poor smoothing it is
a very very good face primer so that is
my go-to um as far as eye primer is
concerned I feel like I always talk
about the Maybelline one that's not a
cruelty-free one but honestly I realized
that I just love all sorts of primers I
really don't have a huge amount of
preference when it comes to eye primers
all of them seem to work pretty darn
similar to me so I'm not going to
include one in this video but I do a
really like the Marc Jacobs coconut eye
primer that's probably been at my
current favorite the one that you guys
recommended and then as far as setting
spray is concerned you guys Smashbox
photo finish primer water all the way
you know that I love my wet and wild
photo focus setting spray but I feel
like these Smashbox is just excellent at
really getting any sort of powdery look
off the face if I over powder my face it
actually does prolong the wear of my
makeup and it is silicone
as well as fragrance-free so would
highly recommend that alright let's talk
a little bit about color correcting the
next color correcting concealer palette
is a one of my all-time favorites I've
hit pan on pretty much every single
shade in here this is definitely a
product that I would repurchase I love
this for color correcting and yes I
still color correct I know a lot of
people don't anymore but I personally do
another favorite for color correcting
are the Urban Decay Naked skin and color
correcting fluids I also have been
enjoying the becca color correctors a
little more now that I have more dry
skin because they are very humectant and
kind of thick but these are great for
all sorts of different skin types I have
all 5 shades you can get peach you can
get green you can get yellow the
lavender all sorts of different stuff I
have a video all about you know color
correcting fluids and stuff like that
you can find that in my miscellaneous
playlist but yeah I really do enjoy
those alright let's go ahead and move on
to concealers there are two this year
that have really really taken me by
storm no sense there really surprised me
and I really kind of understood the sort
of concealer that I look for the first
is the Too Faced Born This Way naturally
radiant concealer I'm getting a little
sick of this one so I think I will
switch it up after I go through this one
but the shade I wear is very fair and it
matches me perfectly when I'm not self
tan when I am self tan I could probably
use the shade fair but this is fantastic
it's very beautiful very creamy
it gives I would say light to medium
coverage underneath the eyes so if you
are looking for something a little more
full coverage might I suggest at the
Tarte shape tape but I personally really
love this and then obviously Abby Tarte
aqua CLR concealer that is just one of
my favorites I wear the shade fair it's
absolutely beautiful
I realized this year that I love a very
light weight concealer I don't have a
lot of darkness underneath my eyes
luckily my darkness and other places
like hyperpigmentation and stuff like
that along my cheekbones but I don't
have a ton of dark circles underneath my
eyes unless I don't get a lot of sleep
which is kind of all the time oh yeah
anyway I really do love the Tarte aqua
sealer but highly recommend you guys
check that one out as well that has been
my fever for the year
alright guys moving on to foundations
and their Cup in a four that have been
definitely my go-to s the first one is
the hourglass illusion hyaluronic skin
tint in the shade vanilla this is
actually something initially I did at
love when I had more combo oily skin at
the beginning of the
but the past six months now that I've
been down here in the desert this has
been my go-to it's beautiful very very
expensive I want to find a cruelty-free
drupe dupe I'm sorry this is cruelty
free but I want to find YouTube that's
cheaper than $58 for this but that
really has been something that I love
and I do enjoy that it has the built-in
SPF another product I've been loving
down here in the desert for the past six
months or the past half year has been
the charts at BB a tinted a moisturizer
with broad-spectrum SPF 20 it is
oil-free antioxidant rich formulated
without parabens mineral oil fatal aids
Tris cleanse sodium lauryl sulfate
gluten all that stuff every day shake I
agree it's really really beautiful I'm
very very light on the skin but
moisturizing and it does have SPF so
again really happen to join these for
the past six months and then when I was
in Milwaukee and when I had a little
more kampala skin and my go-to was
definitely de Tarte Amazonian clay full
coverage foundation with SPF 15
currently I am kind of craving at the
Bekaa full coverage complexion creme a
little more than this one with my dry
skin but I still love this baby all year
round this is the Josie Maran vibrancy
foundation fluid in the shade dynamic
beautiful beautiful foundation for all
sorts of different skin types would
highly recommend you guys look into that
alright let's talk about powders you
guys know I love me my essence all about
Matt fixing compact powder I also love
the tone correcting powder and cool from
alpha when it comes to setting powders I
do prefer drugstore setting powders when
it comes to high-end powders I do like
those for baking so I do enjoy like the
Too Faced Born This Way powder I enjoy
the Kat Von D lock-it setting powder but
my holy grail for the year have been the
essence as well as the elf powder and
then of course it would not be a video
without me mentioning the ambient
lighting powders from hourglass this one
right here is diffuse light it's the
little mini that I carry in my purse I'd
like to set my under eye with this I
also really do enjoy ethereal light
alright guys I'll talk a little bit
about bronzers my go-to is definitely
been at the Physicians Formula Brewer
butter bronzer and you shade bronzer I
also have these shade light bronzer but
I prefer this one just a little more
because it does have more cool tones
running through it it smells amazing it
goes on beautifully it has a little bit
of a sheen but nothing too extravagant
not like shimmer but it's just it looks
kind of satiny on this game not
completely matte
I love it absolutely my go-to bronzer
but I have to say I also really do enjoy
my Too Faced sweethearts bronzer in the
shade sweet tea and this is my glowy
bronzer and this is the one I've been
reaching for all year so would highly
recommend you guys
that went out let's go ahead and talk
about some blush formulas you guys know
I love my Too Faced love flush it
blushes those have been a go-to for me
this year as well as my Tarte Amazonian
clay 12-hour blushes absolutely adore
those I would say the ones that I
consistently reach for over and over
again and wanted to collect more and
more of are the Abeka luminous flushed
of blushes as well as the mineral
blushes I love how pigmented these are
they can also double as eyeshadow the
majority of these are eye safe this
shade right here is called Tiger Lily
from the luminous lush collection and
this guy right here is called songbird
and this is from the mineral collection
they're very neutral the luminous wash
brush does have a little more pop to
them but the shade song burn right here
as well as I think I have one called
what is it flower child God like the
most beautiful go to everyday friendly
blushes so I really do enjoy a my Becca
ones as far as a feast palettes are
concerned I do have two that I've been
reaching for the most this year the
first one is actually from ELF gotta use
this on this palette I love this
this is the second one that I had picked
up this is the beautifully bare total
face palette you get two different
blushes in here a light bronzer as well
as a highlight if you have a fear to
light complexion you need this in your
life it has a beautiful mirror beautiful
a mirrored kind of packaging so I do
love that and then of course it wouldn't
be a video without me mentioning the
Becca Jacqueline Hill champagne
collection face palette I know you can't
get this anymore but you know what I've
been using the out of it this year
I'm about to hit pan on champagne pop
you get two different blushes in here
one of them is a luminous flush blush in
the shade rosy spritz you also get
amaretto as well as Pomplamoose which
are mineral blushes and then you get
Prosecco pop and champagne pop love this
absolutely love it so I've been reaching
a lot for that
alright guys four highlighters I feel
like towards the beginning of the year I
was definitely reaching a lot for my
laura geller Bay gelato swirl
illuminators I do have three different
shades the first one is called gilded
honey which is the one that everybody
seems to know about I also do have the
beautiful peachy color called peachy
glow that I really do enjoy and now that
I have a little more of a tan and of
course charming pink is just absolutely
beautiful if you are a sucker for a cool
tone pink shade so I was reaching a lot
for those I'm towards the beginning
probably the first six months of the
year as well as my hourglass ambient
lighting strobing powders I love how
these look on the skin very natural very
very beautiful but I have to say
currently
the last six months so basically the
first six months of the year those were
the ones I was reading for but in the
past six months my go-to is a happy nad
wet and wild Mecca glow highlighting
powders my favorite shoes are definitely
blossom glow as well as precious petals
and golden a flower crown I also have
obviously been loving my Becca
shimmering skin perfecter press I would
say the one that I've been here we
aren't with the one that I've been
wearing year round has been at rose
quartz this one is a really really
neutral pink color it's not too cool
tone or too warm tone so it works for a
lot of different skin tones in my
opinion about the one that I am
currently loving is a lilac geode which
is a little more cool tone kind of
purple lavender color with a goldish
sheen running through it absolutely love
that one currently and then I have to go
ahead and throw in one of the light
chaser highlighters I do own all six of
these originally I was only going to
keep four but then I found out I really
like all six actually now that I have a
little more of a tan but my all-time
favorite one out of all of them is
definitely champagne at flashes a
Bellini champagne dream flashes Bellini
so I thought they'd go ahead and share
those with you guys now let's go ahead
and talk about my go-to eyeshadow
palettes for the year this one was done
we hard because I feel like I am
so into my eyeshadow palette collection
I love blushes highlights I love eye
shadows it's really really hard to pick
a but if I had to pick I would say my
go-to neutral palette has been me
Tartelette in bloom I actually prefer
the toasted palette over this one now
but this has been my go-to for the whole
entire year the toasted just came out so
I didn't think it would be fair to
mention that one now if I want even more
a warm tone kind of eye I definitely go
with my modern or Renaissance this is
been my go-to the whole year I
love it I feel like I really get into
these shadows yet I never hit pan so
many people hit pan on these quickly but
I don't seem to be able to maybe I just
don't use a ton of them but and then for
cool toned eyeshadows you guys my lorac
mega pro 2 is definitely the go-to when
it comes to cool tone eyeshadows you
guys will be able to see this is a
well-loved palette a lot of my lorac
palette especially the pro formulas are
well loved these are so creamy and
buttery and I really do love the cool
tone shades in here I will go for blue
quartz or ash or forest when I want
something really really nice and cool
toned in the crease and then I add on
probably one of these little shimmers on
the lid usually and it looks really good
so those are my going to I've said
it's for the year I feel like it would
not be a proper favorites video without
mentioning at these steely glitter and
glows I love the duo Chrome's a lot but
I also really do love the original one
so this song right here is called smokey
storm really really beautiful kind of
cool toned a goal there's shoe you know
kind of color a little bit of gold and
brown in there this guy right here is
Sunset Cove I love just all of them all
of them are great I have the
gold one on my eyes today it's really
beautiful and these are just so much fun
a really nice way to vamp up your makeup
style without looking like you put too
much effort in because I feel like they
look very effortless and they look like
okay you may have took a little bit of
time putting your eye look together but
they're actually very quick and easy to
use so I love my stealing littering
glows and now when it comes to mascaras
this year you guys know I'm a mascara
junkie but these are actually my
favorite so first one it has only been a
favorite for the past three months
it is the Marc Jacobs velvet noir
mascara but I had to mention it because
I can't put this down it's beautiful
great trifecta sort of mascara length
the volume definition all that good
stuff but I also have been reaching a
lot from my Charlotte Tilbury full-fat
lashes mascara initially I didn't think
I love this as much as I do but it is
the natural bristle wand it has a little
bit of a dry formula but also a wet
formula I love the way it goes on the
lashes anytime I want something natural
this is the mascara that I reach for and
then of course I think the go to go to
this year has been Urban Decay
perversion now this is a very slick
formula and I feel like down here in the
heat it's a little harder to work with
but definitely I feel like this is
probably the holy grail of the year I
just reach for this a lot I feel like
two coats of this I can get really
clumpy nice gloopy looking lashes or
just definitely not everybody's style
but come on I'm the queen of clumpy
lashes okay so yeah I would have to say
our bit Decay perversion has definitely
been my go-to mascara for the year
alright guys then finally we have a few
lip products here I'm not really a lip
junkie I have a lot of lip products I
needed declutter some of them definitely
doing more to clutter videos coming soon
for you guys but the first one I really
have fallen in love with these two-faced
sweet peach lip oils this has been like
this has been a thing this year
you know this collection came out in
February and initially I didn't love it
and then guest
I've been wearing this and the other
Papa don't peach shade pretty much like
every day I like to pack these in two of
my purse I love the pigmentation level I
love the taste and then they smell
really good they taste really good they
do rub off on my food had to eat when
I'm teaching but it's not anything crazy
and you know what they feel very
comfortable they're hella hella
comfortable so I have to mention though
is and then I found these guys the
Burt's Bees gloss lip crayons and my
goodness do I like these this particular
shade is called Pacific Coast pink I
love the way these go onto the lips
initially I didn't really want to try
these out because these are vegan and I
don't know I have this misconception
that vegan makeup wasn't that good I'm
gonna do an upcoming video soon talking
about you know is cruelty free and vegan
makeup just as good is not cruelty free
and non vegan makeup and the answer is
yes you can find some really good
natural products out there and this is
one of them so I love these little
chubby crayons are easy to put onto the
lips and paint on really quickly in the
morning and then finally at my um whose
booze formula from you-know-who by
beauty has to be on the list honey comb
is my awesome awesome beautiful your
lips but better sort of nude so anyway
of those are the little lip products
that I want to mention alright guys so
let's go ahead and move on to some
skincare shall we
skincare skincare skincare you know I
love me some skincare so let me show you
at my all-time favorite mass of the year
and the first one is actually from the
drugstore this is from formula 1006 this
is the deep down detox ultra cleansing a
mud mask I'm obsessed with this this is
the best ultra cleansing mud kind of
mask that I have in my collection
because and not only could I use it when
I had combo oily skin but also it does
work for me when I have dry skin it
doesn't dry down to that super tight
feeling where like you can't move your
face whatsoever kind of like super mud
or even you've mud from a glam glow it
has a really nice scent to it and when I
rinse it off I really do feel like my
pores feel or maybe look a little
tighter I know you can't actually shrink
your pores but you know they feel a
little tighter my skin looks very taut
and I also feel like it does help with
breakouts so the deep down detox alter
cleansing mud mat mud mask with orange
and bergamot has definitely been a
favorite and then when my skin is a
little more irritated I do go in with my
Unani dermal defense face mask it's a
very very light to gel sort of mask I
like to leave it on for about 15 minutes
and then I rinse with cool water and it
really does
help with irritation so I really do
enjoy that guy no I do you have a couple
of now I think I have one scrub here
that I've been really really fascinated
with this year it is the nip plus fab
exfoliates glycolic fix scrub this isn't
a really Ford a really really affordable
brand from Ulta and I love this guy
colic scrub I really do feel like I see
a difference in my skin it helps
exfoliate of course it has big large
particles to kind of exfoliate your skin
but it also does help with the breakouts
right now I'm really into luscious ocean
salt but I've only been using that
probably about half a year now I mean I
had this thing in high school but I was
obsessed with it then I stopped using it
then I started again this guy has really
been my all-time favorite for the whole
entire year so that's why I wanted to
share this one as far as cleansers are
concerned the best e-jelly cleanser from
a drunk elephant has been a favorite the
past six months but before that I would
say the Tarte rainforest of the sea deep
cleansing gel has been consistent
throughout the whole year I love this
stuff it's really really really good
Tarte sometimes doesn't have the best
makeup product but they sure as hell do
have good skin care and body products so
I have to give them credit where credit
is due this is a great cleanser in my
opinion now for essence this year I've
had a really hard time finding a good
essence that's cruelty free but I did
find this guy I found this one eight
months ago it is the elf hydrating water
essence and I have not looked back this
is my second bottle I absolutely love
this if you are looking for a hydrating
essence something to put on after your
toner would highly recommend you look
into the elf one it is only ten dollars
and you do get a full five two fluid
ounces of product in here alright moving
on to night two treatments I definitely
love you know my luna night oil and all
these sort of different night treatments
but I have to say the one that I think
I've been reaching for the most
consistently and the one that really
works for all sorts of different skin
types this have probably sensitive has
been from the ordinary this is a brand
that definitely skyrocketed this year
this is the lactic acid 5% I love this
I've used this probably about three
times a week
I just take two dropper folds I put it
all over my neck the back of my hands as
well as on my face I avoid my eye area
in my lip area but you know what this is
fantastic and it really is a good at
price I am very fascinated with the
ordinary altogether I really love their
rosehip seed oil as well but I have to
say the lactic acid treatment has been
my go-to treatment this year I do you
have another cleanser here that I wanted
to mention because I was using this like
crazy the first six months of the year
it is from the body shop it's called the
tea tree skin clearing facial wash it
smells amazing
well it smells amazing if you like the
scent of tea tree if you don't like the
scent of tea tree oil you won't think
it's amazing but it really does help
clear up breakouts without using Selleck
acid or benzoyl peroxide so I can still
use it now that I do have more dry skin
I do like a little breakout right here
today and I've been having a few little
breakouts here and there you know around
my period and stop and this has been a
really nice cleanser so I thought I'd go
ahead and mention that when it comes to
neck cream at my go-to has been my Mario
Badescu a vitamin aid and neck cream
I've been using this on and off for a
year since college but I really don't
use anything else on my neck I try and
take all my products on down my neck or
up my neck I kind of like to rub with
the back of my hand and go up in an
upward stroking motion and then go onto
my face with any sort of product but at
night time this is definitely my go-to
it's very thick it's very luxurious it's
beautiful and you know what once in a
while I also pop this onto my face when
my skin is extremely extremely dry so I
love the vitamin A de neck crema from
Mario Badescu oh I would say toner of
the year has to go to the fairs of witch
hazel you guys recommend it I picked
this up I found it at Target for like
$5.99 you get 12 fluid ounces a product
it's cruelty free you can get the rose
petal one like I have it you can get
glee green tea gleam tea green tea you
can also go ahead and get lavender I
mean this is just some really really
good stuff and now that I'm thinking
about it I feel like I should also
include the Mario Badescu rose water
with aloe herbs and rose water right is
that what it's called to get the pink
one I feel like I should include that in
this video because whenever my skin is
irritated and I don't want to put on
like the Unani NAP mask or anything like
that
I'm having like a lupus flare I will
miss that on to my skin and it really
just kind of helps to soothe everything
down but I really do love this toner
great for dry skin great for normal skin
great for all sorts of different skin
types would highly recommend you guys
look into that witch hazel toner now eye
cream of the year I really don't believe
in I currency guys I'd say just take
your moisturizer and put that where you
know you would put it around your eyes
as long as I safe but I feel like at the
beginning of the year I was definitely
definitely raving about the yes to
grapefruit dark circle correcting eye
cream it's not moisturizing enough for
me anymore you guys it really isn't but
it does help with a little bit of blue
tones underneath your eyes because it is
a tinted yellow and I mean I feel like
when I did have more combo oily skin
this was enough for me but now I need
something a little more hydrating I like
to just take my ordinary rosehip seed
oil and tap that underneath
it's in the morning and at nighttime
it's great so I did want to include this
I feel like this would be great if you
are starting out with eye creams if you
want something from the drugstore that
really does work I do enjoy this eye
cream it's lightweight it's nice it's a
good starter eye cream but it's not
really something I reach for all that
often the past six months but at the
beginning of the year I sure did and
finally guys on my moisturizer of the
year probably will come as no surprise
it's the Josie Maran Argan infinity
intensive creamy oil there have been so
many new moisturizers that I've been
trying out and I feel like I need to try
something new after using this but now
this is what my six tubes that I've gone
through I go through these all the time
they're great super super hydrating if
you have extremely dry skin extremely
chapped skin and this is definitely
gonna be the moisturizer for you so yeah
let me see Josie Maran Argan infinity
intensive creamy oil now let's go ahead
and talk about the miscellaneous
products and then we will wrap this
video up fragrance of the year
definitely has to go to the charlotte
tilbury scent of a dream perfume as well
as the Elizabeth and James Nirvana
bourbon perfume I have bourbon on today
I love this scent I do not believe they
are cruelty free but I did pick this up
when it first release which was last
year and you know what it smells amazing
it's totally my kind of scent it kind of
smells like a bonfire very warm a very
very kind of musky but not overly musky
I just really enjoyed this perfume and
then scent of a dream I know why I love
this it smells like my grandmother and I
know you may be thinking really you want
to smell like your grandma it's a very
professional a very very nice scent I
like to wear this to work because I feel
like it's not overly sweet and it's just
it really reminds me of my grandma I
don't know what to say it's a beautiful
beautiful fragrance and I don't want you
guys thinking that it's a very very
mature scent it is a little more on the
mature side but I feel like at the same
time it has a little level of sweetness
to it so what I would recommend doing is
go ahead and go to like Charlotte
Tilbury counter or whatever and take a
whiff of it because you would be
surprised this is a beautiful perfume
self tanner of the year you guys it
definitely becomes
youth you and starfruit touch of summer
for fair skin tones SPF 30 daily
moisturizing gradual self-tanning crab
this is the only self tanner I have been
using all year long everybody asked me
when I use this is it it's great it
smells really good you do get that
little bit of like DHA kind of like
burning flesh scent after a while with
all the self tanners do while it's
processing but you wash it off in the
morning
left with a beautiful golden tan and I
love that this does to have SPF 30 in it
I think that's so cool this is a cruelty
free product it's also vegan hence it's
a cold line I get this at Ulta so I
would highly recommend you guys check
that out all right back products of the
year from Lula should definitely be
comforter bubble bar I love this I break
off a little pieces of it I probably get
six or seven different backs so from
this so I just break it off in pieces I
hold it under warm running water it
smells amazing like raspberries and
blueberries and cream and it will make a
full full bath full of bubbles so I
really enjoy that and then also this guy
right here which is called blue skies
and fluffy white clouds same sort of
thing it is a bubble bar and it smells
amazing it's very very fresh smelling so
if you like patchouli and you like
something a little more uplifting I
would highly recommend that one I also
really do enjoy Brightside which is very
very uplifting it is citrus I prefer
those two at nighttime alright guys and
finally we have some body products I
just have two here the first one is from
Alta Beauty this is the nectarine rose
moisturizing body lotion and this is the
third one that I have gone through I
love the scent on this I love this for
the springtime and the winter time I
mean it really just smells good and
uplifting and it's just one of those
scents I connect with kind of like these
Charlotte Tilbury
ascent of a dream so this is definitely
my go-to when I want an everyday sort of
body lotion and the Ulta beauty brand is
cruelty free which is awesome you can
usually get these like buy three get
three free and then of course for a
really really nice luxurious body butter
I always go for my Brazilian boom boom
cream I love a lot of body butters I
love the ones from Josie Maran I love
the ones from the body shop but this is
really something special it smells
amazing it really does kind of help the
skin to look a little more talked I
wouldn't say it necessarily firms up
your ass I haven't firm my house up but
I do feel like it gives a little bit of
moisture and it does make things look a
little more taut because it has the
tiniest amount of shimmer running
through it so but highly recommend you
guys look into that the scent is
intoxicating and it just makes me feel
good when you're putting it on so anyway
guys that is it that is my best in
beauty for 2017 I hope you guys enjoyed
this video like I said we'll be talking
about this shittiest beauty products of
2017 on Thursday but I will see you guys
tomorrow for an ante haul all about
that I'm not gonna buy during the month
of December so see you guys then thank
you for joining me five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
