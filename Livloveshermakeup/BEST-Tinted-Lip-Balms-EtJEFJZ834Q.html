super excited and I'm just like
following the list that I have on my on
my phone of YouTube ideas I wanted to do
it everything seems to be like best of
this best of that and so now I'm getting
excited so the one that was uh after the
red nail polishes was best tinted lip
balms and when I say tinted lip balms I
do not mean regular lip balms like this
okay yes this is sad I'm aware but
remember I'm a flute player I need very
moisturize what's know I'm talking about
like tinted tinted like you know gives
you some color actually one of them in
here actually does give some color I
lied there's a few in there but um I
could talk my favorites and I'm gonna
show you so the ones I want to start
with our recent purchases and I love
them these are the NYX butter lip balms
I have an imperfect so red velvet and
parfait and these are really nice
they're not too glossy they kind of like
just give just the right amount of
moisture and I can actually use these if
I'm practicing my food like they don't
rub off so I think that's so cool I want
to get more umm the next ones I want to
talk about are from josie maran they
come in these cute little like genie
pots
the colors are kiss me which is like a
light pink uh heaven which is like a it
looks like it's clear but it's not it's
got some shimmer in there and it's kind
of a topi color and then this last color
is my favorite it's called Rosie and
these are like tinted lip balms and they
smell good and they have that Argan
formula in there like the argan oil so
they're super super moisturizing and I
just think they win best packaging more
and I've got to see it but these are
just amazingly moisturizing I mean these
are ones I cannot wear when I'm
practicing my flute because they just
stick on there forever but if you are
having like a dry lip day and you want
some color it's a good little trio to
have another little trio well you buy
these separately but these have lasted
me forever at these are the elf
conditioning lip balms
I consider these majorly tinted lip
balms like these are alike yeah like
lots of color comes out of a they have
SPF in them this one's my favorite I
think this is bliss low Berry yeah yeah
blissful berry the other one was mellow
melon and this one right here as I
believe got romantic Rouge and this
one's nice too these tastes like candy
they smell like candy they come in these
big like gigantic kind of blast things
that are kind of hard to store but if
you store them upside down you can see
which color you're grabbing and I think
they're only a couple dollars on the
website I love those those are very
moisturizing full-on pigmentation and I
also want to mention these speaking of
elf
these are lip balm tints and these taste
delicious and they remind me of do you
remember that brand hip from like
L'Oreal they had these little like ah
jellies like this that you could put on
your lips and these are like I'm not
going to say these are super
moisturizing but they're still fun to
use and poke your finger in there and
they actually give off some nice color
so I have the colors berry and what's
this orange one oh my god I can't open
it ah that was sad peach so they
actually do give up a really nice color
I mean I feel like alpha is know for
that though like they do have good
pigmentation when it comes to their lip
products in my opinion so next what
shall we talk about um well I guess a
better reaching that little lip balm
pick out the one that actually does have
tint in there I saw deciding it
somewhere oh here this little Vaseline
tub the rosy lips
oh this gives beautiful color to your
lips like a beautiful rosy color and
it's in the cutest packaging you will
ever find and it smells like roses so
you can't beat that I think there might
be a few others in here oh yeah like
those Nivea ones um like a kiss of
cherry and things like that those are
slightly tinted but um they are not my
favorites this video is about the best
mist so next I'm going to have
to pull up this little tray full of lip
products here so next I wanted to talk
about cuz I can't just pull them all out
so I want to talk about baby lips I have
a whole two rows of them right there I
love baby lips I love the formula I love
the color
I love the smell I love everything about
them I just I love them
I like the crystal one I'm like every
single line I have just by I'm obsessed
cutest packaging gotta be right in the
front um and next oh how am I gonna do
this this is a recent purchase but these
little sugar from fresh these little lip
balms these are amazingly moisturizing I
got the pack of one two three four five
six seven of them for life I think like
$40 a Sephora which is a great deal
because one of them usually goes for
life I think they're all right there one
of them goes for maybe like $26 is crazy
but these they are so moisturizing guys
I mean it is really really impressive
and they actually have some beautiful
colors this one right here I think this
is the very end love this one's
beautiful matches my nails and really
really I just I'm really impressed with
those another thing I guess I want to
kind of mention are like right here I
have color whispers I think that color
whispers can be considered like a bomb
kind of thing but I consider the more
lipstick II but since I brought them up
I'm going to have to bring up my Revlon
lip butters - so let me just grab the
two nearest ones because I just
purchased these ones um I have a lot of
them but um these are super moisturizing
they feel like a foam now I think they
give the color of a lipstick and I
consider them lipsticks but they feel
like a balm so you know I guess you
could consider them bombs but they are
not I don't know to me they're not
they're just too full of color you know
so um anyway those were my favorite
bombs um I do have more like laying
around here but I am like a certain
thing but like them to be really
moisturizing have good color
and yeah and I must say I have been
really really I mean I know that this
little set is expensive and always sold
out but this little sugar set your pies
Wow I'm really impressed I'm really
impressed with the pigmentation
everything I mean yeah get it if you see
it at Sephora because they were sold out
online and then I was in Milwaukee
Wisconsin and they had one left in the
store and I just snatched it up I think
on goes to our website you can get three
for like 30
but then for this one you get like 850
so don't buy the 3-pack get like the
full seven or eight of them anyway so
those were my favorite I'm just looking
around to make sure yes I'm gonna go
ahead and say those were my favorite
tinted lip balms I think that they give
beautiful color they're moisturizing
they just you know I don't know I like
them they they just they feel good
tinted lip balms are awesome they have
become all the rage I would say in the
past two years and they deserve it
so those are my favorite tinted lip
balms I guess I could do a favorite lip
balm video since I have that big tub of
them over there I've tried a lot um
anyway um I will talk to you guys in my
next video
okay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
