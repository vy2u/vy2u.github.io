best volumizing hair products in my
opinion yeah I have very very fine
straight hair right now it's actually
teased up a little bit but if I brush it
out you can see that it just kind of
goes completely flat yeah I don't want
that
so basically I've only been searching
for volume or volumizing products that
are gonna work I guess I'll just start
with this one
this is a teasing comb a lot of people
are gonna say don't do this and I would
say it depends on what you do in your
normal routine I probably blow-dry my
hair maybe once a week I don't really I
never use a straightener this is air
dried I don't need a straightener my
hair is already straight if I want to
curl my hair then yeah I'll do that
but um I really only use heat styling
tools probably once a week and usually
if I do do some kind of curler it's like
those wraps snap and goes that staying
overnight and they're not heat or things
like that
um so what I mean is that if you
blow-dry your hair every single day then
no I would not recommend getting a
teasing comb now if you are like me and
you really don't you know you only do it
like once in a while
absolutely this is fine now you don't
want to go teasing the ends of your hair
this is like five years old down here
you want to be teasing up here where
like the new growth is that where it's
like you know six months old so only
tease at the roots that's really only
like where you need the illusion of
volume um the rest of the hair you can
find products for that and I'll
recommend some so definitely a teasing
comb I got mine on Amazon for like five
or six dollars um the next few things I
want to talk about our dry shampoos dry
shampoos are like a thin haired girls
like best friend I use one for when my
hair is clean which is today uh yes I'll
get out of the shower and my hair dries
and I will use dry shampoo and I don't
use it because my hair is dirty
obviously I use it because it does help
boost volume at like the crown and the
top of the head so uh currently I'm
using the batiste dry shampoo in
light and blonde has the hint of color
and because of that I did not use this
when I wear my hair off so basically I
wash my hair every other day I'll have
my hair down one day and then if you
ever see it up that means it's dirty
I mean it's literally literally the gets
so dirty that I can't even wear it down
and make it look like acceptable so when
I wear it up and it's dirty I use this
this is like super heavy-duty dry
shampoo this is the bumble and bumble
Preta powder it says it's equal parts
dry shampoo style extender and volume in
a pinch and that is exactly what it is
it's awesome it is too tacky to use in
my like clean day hair like when I get
out of the shower
it just gets like gunky in like this
area I mean I've tried I thought it's so
great I'm gonna get so much volume but
it really didn't look good when I'm
wearing my hair down it only looks good
when I wear it off so when I wear my
hair up when I wear my hair down because
when I like spray this in and I want to
wear my hair up I can't like brush out
the color so probably not gonna get the
hint of blond one next time just go with
the regular one or that cherry one that
smells really good so the next thing I
want to recommend is a nice good
hairspray and by that I mean one that is
acceptable for this kind of hair which
is fine you know thin hair um a lot of
hair sprays we actually weigh the hair
down so yes they stick but also if
you're thinking about it a really sticky
one is gonna be okay for someone who has
like curly hair things like that they
just have stronger hair it is gonna look
so gunky and dirty in hair like ours you
know if it's fine and thin like that
it's gonna look so dirty and disgusting
and it's gonna feel tacky you're not
gonna like it
I recommend L'Oreal l l net um this is
the unscented extra stronghold you
basically put this in and you can like
brush it out I mean it's not like you
brush it out it feels like you brush it
out there it doesn't feel like there's
anything there but it will hold volume
it will hold curls it will hold
everything that you needed 12 so I
really recommend that and the next three
products I'm gonna talk about are for
when you get out of the shower so the
first one is a leave-in conditioner no
matter
what kind of hair type you have you need
to leave you need to use a leave-in
conditioner um everybody's hair needs
extra moisture it doesn't matter if you
have fine hair doesn't matter if you
have coarse hair
everybody needs a leave-in conditioner
so I found a leave-in conditioner that
also has um like a thickening product in
it so this is the Shea Moisture yuca and
baobab bulb
sickening growth milk with biotin and
bamboo extract for fine thin hair is
strengthens thickens and volumizes so
this moisturizes so that's really good
and then it also has those extra like
plant extracts in there that help to
volumize so i only use the smallest
amount of this and I only use it from
probably my ear down because if I use
like a lotion or something up here I'll
have to wash my hair right away it will
just way down way too much so again I
like that on my ends and I do think it
kind of like expands this you know the
strands so it's nice I like the brand a
Shea Moisture that was only like $11 a
tween breed and I've had it for months
now and that's how much I've used you
only need the smallest amount and the
last year products I want to talk about
are just like leave-in products um so
I'm not talking about I'm talking about
like styling products now these are not
like leaving conditioners um so the
first one I want to talk about is the
pro Ganic soy protein plus caffeine
volume root boost finish plus body
builder I do not use this on my roots I
only use it as a body builder I spray
this all over everywhere except for my
roots and this is awesome it really
really like I feel like it's like eight
stands this is my strands of hair I
don't even know but it feels so good it
does not get sticky or tacky and it
doesn't make my hair look dirty so that
is a huge plus I'm super happy I found
this I actually didn't find it I think I
got this in like my glossy box like two
months ago so really really awesome
product highly recommend and then the
one I use on my roots is the nexus salon
hair care hydra light weightless
moisture root lift mist it targets roots
to lift hair for added fullness and body
so this has some kind of like sea
mineral in it yeah deep sea minerals so
it
has texture to it so I can't actually
use this in like the length of my hair
it will look dirty like it will actually
just look like greasy and dirty it's too
heavy which is fine that's fine um but
it's awesome for the roots it really
doesn't make my roots look dirty it just
kind of gives them a nice leg lift and
so I tip my head over I apply that all
over rub it into my scalp and then I
apply this and then I apply this product
from the ear down so that's why I do
when I get out of the shower and those
are the products I want to share with
you guys um again there's other ways to
build volume yes you could use a product
and then blow-dry your hair that's gonna
get the most volume but I really like
when I can find a product that works
even when I don't blow down my hair
because I really only heat style
probably once a week so um I hope this
was helpful if you have any other tips
for fine hair I mean I'm always looking
so please leave them below and share
with everybody and I'll see you guys in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
