best volumizing hair products in my
opinion yeah I have very very fine
straight hair um right now it's actually
teased up a little bit but if I brush it
out you can see that it just kind of
goes completely flat um yeah I don't
want that so basically I have only been
searching for volume or volumizing
products that are going to work I guess
I'll just start with this one this is a
teasing comb a lot of people are going
to say don't do this and I would say it
depends on what you do in your normal
routine I probably blow dry my hair baby
once a week I don't really I never use a
straightener this is air dried I don't
need a straightener my hair is already
straight um if I want to curl my hair
then yeah I'll do that but um I really
only use heat styling tools probably
once a week and usually if I do do some
kind of curler it's like those wraps nap
and goes that staying overnight and
they're non heat or things like that um
so what I mean is that if you blow dry
your hair every single day then no I
would not recommend getting a teasing
comb now if you were like me and you
really don't you know you only do it
like once in a while absolutely this is
fine now you don't want to go teasing
the ends of your hair this is like five
years old down here you want to be
teasing up here we're like the new
growth is that where it's like you know
six months old so only tease at the
roots that's really only like where you
need the illusion of volume um the rest
of the hair you can find products for
that and I'll recommend some so
definitely a teasing comb I got mine on
amazon for like five or six dollars um
the next few things I want to talk about
our dry shampoos dry shampoos are like a
thin haired girls like best friend um I
use one for when my hair is clean which
is today um yes I'll get all the shower
and my hair dries and i will use dry
shampoo and i don't use it because my
hair sturdy obviously i use it because
it does help boost volume at like the
crown and the top of the head so uh
currently I'm using the batiste dry
shampoo in the light
blonde has a hint of color and because
of that I do not use this when I wear my
hair off so basically I wash my hair
every other day I'll have my hair down
one day and then if you ever see it up
that means it's dirty it mean it's
literally literally gets so dirty that I
can't even wear it down and make it look
like acceptable so when I wear it up and
it's dirty i use this this is like super
heavy-duty dry shampoo this is the
bumble and bumble preta powder it says
it's equal parts dry shampoo style
extender and volume in a pinch and that
is exactly what it is it's awesome it is
too tacky to use in my like cleaned a
hair like when I get out of the shower
it just gets like gunky in like this
area I mean I've tried I thought oh it's
so great i'm gonna get so much volume
but it really didn't look good when I'm
wearing my hair down it only looks good
when I wear it off so when I wear my
hair up want to wear my hair down
because when I like spray this in and I
want to wear my hair up I can't like
brush out the color so probably not
going to get the hint of blonde one next
time just go with the regular one or
that cherry one that smells really good
so the next thing i want to recommend is
a nice good hair spray and by that i
mean one that is acceptable for this
kind of hair which is fine you know thin
hair um a lot of hair sprays we actually
way the hair down so yes they stick but
also if you're thinking about it a
really sticky one is going to be okay
for someone who has like curly hair um
things like that they just have stronger
hair it is going to look so gunky and
dirty in hair like ours you know if it's
fine and thin like that it's gonna look
so dirty and disgusting and it's gonna
feel tacky you're not gonna like it i
recommend l'oreal LOL net um this is the
unscented extra stronghold you basically
put this in and you can like brush it
out I mean it's not like you brush it
out it feels like you brush it out there
it doesn't feel like there's anything
there but it will hold volume it will
hold curls it will hold everything that
you needed 12 so I really recommend that
and the next three products I want to
talk about are for when you get out of
the shower so the first one is a
leave-in conditioner no matter what kind
of hair type you have you need to leave
you need to use a leave it
um everybody's hair needs extra moisture
it doesn't matter if you have fine here
doesn't matter if you have course here
everybody needs a leave-in conditioner
so i found a leave-in conditioner that
also has um like a thickening product in
it so this is the Shea Moisture yoga and
baobab below Bob thickening growth milk
with biotin and bamboo extract for fine
thin hair is strengthens thickens and
volumizes so this moisturizes so that's
really good and then it also has those
extra like plant extracts in there that
help to volumize so I only use the
smallest amount of this and i only use
it from probably my ear down and because
if i use like a lotion or something up
here i'll have to wash my hair right
away it will just way down way too much
so again i like that on my ends and i do
think it kind of like expands this you
know the strands so it's nice i like the
brand a shea moisture that was only like
eleven dollars at tween breed and i've
had it for months now and that's how
much i've used you only need the
smallest amount and the last year
products i want to talk about our just
like leave in products so i'm not
talking about I'm talking about like
styling products now these are not like
leaving conditioners um so the first one
I want to talk about is the pro ganic
soy protein plus caffeine volume root
boost finish + bodybuilder I do not use
this on my roots I only use it as a
bodybuilder I spray this all over
everywhere except for my roots and this
is awesome it really really like I feel
like it's like a spans this my strands
of hair I don't even know but it feels
so good it does not get sticky or tacky
and it doesn't make my hair look dirty
so that is a huge plus I'm super happy I
found this I actually didn't find it I
think I got this in like my glossybox
like two months ago so really really
awesome product highly recommend and
then the one I use on my roots is the
nexus salon haircare Hydra light
weightless moisture root lift missed it
targets roots to lift hair for added
fullness and body so this has some kind
of like sea mineral in it um yeah deep
sea minerals so it um has texture to it
so I can't actually use this in like the
link
my hair it will look dirty like it will
actually just look like greasy and dirty
it's too heavy which is fine that's fine
um but it's awesome for the roots it
really doesn't make my roots look dirty
it just kind of gives them a nice leg
lifts and so I tip my head over I apply
that all over rub it into my scalp and
then I apply this and then I apply this
product from the ear down so that's why
I do when I get out of the shower and
those are the products i want to share
with you guys um again there's other
ways to build volume yes you could use a
product and then blow-dry your hair
that's going to get the most volume but
i really like when I can find a product
that works even when I don't blow down
my hair because i really only heat style
probably once weeks so um i hope this
was helpful if you have any other tips
for fine hair i mean i'm always looking
so please leave them below and share
with everybody and i'll see you guys in
my next video bite</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
