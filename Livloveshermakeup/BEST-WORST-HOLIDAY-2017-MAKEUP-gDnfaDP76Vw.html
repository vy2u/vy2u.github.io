welcome back to my channel today I am
taking all of my holiday 2017 makeup
that I have purchased and thus far and
I'm going to be sharing with you guys my
five-star rated products my 4 star rated
products my 3 star rated products my 2
star rated products as well as of course
my 1 star rated products now that this
is just so far obviously we haven't even
really hit the holiday season yet I mean
for Christ's sake it's not even
Halloween yet okay so I am guessing
there is going to be a part two to this
video if you have been keeping up with
my reviews on these products some of
this is going to be repetitive for you
so feel free to go ahead and skip this
video if you already know my thoughts on
the majority of these products but it
was very very highly requested that I do
a roundup and talk about what I
recommend the most and what I recommend
the least so I do you want to say really
quickly before we get into it as well
this is only holiday 2017 makeup not
fall 2017 releases only holiday 2017
releases so if you're interested in seen
the toasted palette from chart or in the
color pop I think I love you palette I
can also do a fall 2017 makeup releases
for those those are not holiday 2017
releases their fall releases so let me
know if you would like a part two or
just a separate video on those but yeah
let's go ahead and just jump right into
it I want to start with the five star
rated products there are three of them
and the first one is from fight beauty
this is the amuse-bouche lipstick set
and this is the one that comes in the
little tin as you guys can see this does
retail for 25 dollars and inside of here
you are getting a group arrangement with
an arrangement of a muted kind of
everyday natural shades that you can
wear and these are just a little minis
of the bite Beauty a moose Boosh formula
this is definitely a five-star rated set
I feel like every single year I am going
to give this a 5 star because it's just
a really really good value a lot of
people have been saying like oh they're
so small for twenty-five dollars if you
actually look at the amount of product
you're getting this is a great value set
this would be awesome as a stocking
stuffer it would be awesome for any sort
of holiday that you celebrate this is
just a great gift to go ahead and give
to someone but also it's something that
you can treat for yourself so this shade
right here is called Cayenne it's a
beautiful beautiful true red color and
then the majority of them the other
three shades are pretty muted this one
right here is called sugarcane which is
a little more of licking lilac pink
color if you are someone who does enjoy
more cool town lipsticks I think you
would love this
they both beauty a Musa Bush formula is
very moisturizing it's very creamy these
go on really really fantastically the
only thing I would warn against is that
if you're not someone who likes to pair
a lip liner with your lipsticks you
might not love these but I feel like
this definitely deserves the five star
rating the next shade that we have here
is honeycomb which is one of my favorite
nudes from bite Beauty it's not too warm
toned or to a cult own distress very
very neutral and beautiful and then
finally the last eight we have is called
rhubarb and this is what rhubarb it
looks like really nice kind of neutral
plum shade so this is definitely a
five-star rated kids in my opinion let
me know if you went ahead and picked up
B by PD a mousse bouche a little tin for
the holiday season but yes that is the
first five-star rated product I want to
talk about up next we have a
highlighting palette that will
definitely come as no surprise if you
guys have been watching my other videos
it is the cover FX perfect highlighting
a palette for holiday 2017 I purchased
this at Ulta inside of here you get six
the different highlighters and out of
all of the highlighting palettes that
have released this season thus far this
has been at my favorite I love the
formula I love the texture on these I
love that they can be natural but I also
built up on the skin for a high shine
impact I love the mirror I love the
packaging very very travel friendly so
this has definitely been an item that I
would rage 5 out of 5 stars I love the
color selection as well I feel like a
lot of people are going to be able to go
ahead and reach for this one of my
favorite shades in here is definitely
this one which is called prism it is
just this beautiful beautiful midtone
pink shade with a little bit of a silver
shift and again you can layer these
colors together so if you're worried
about things being too dark go ahead and
take those two lighter shades which are
prism as well as blossom and layer those
together with the darker shades they
look amazing I would HIGHLY highly
recommend if you cover FX perfect
highlighting palette
alright guys then finally the last 5
star rated product I have here is the
mascara this has quickly become one of
my all-time favorite mascaras it is from
Marc Jacobs this is the velvet whare
mascara now this was in the holiday 2017
packaging and this is something that you
can buy year-round though it just won't
come in this particular packaging but
this is an amazing at mascara it is a
pretty elect as far as the formula is
concerned as you guys can see the one
here has an hourglass shape but I feel
like it's not so wet so that it's like
the Urban Decay perversion but it's not
so dry that it's like the Too Faced
better than sex it's just the perfect
amount of wetness that sounds so weird
what a drying this combined
I love the wand I love everything about
it I really like the smell smells kind
of woodsy
I don't know sometimes mascaras smell
really good to me but overall this is
just a great formula to definitely
recommend this it has definitely worth
the 30 20 20 $30 range whatever it is
however much this costs it's just it is
quickly become a favorite of mine so I
would give this a solid 5 stars what how
do you recommend you guys go ahead and
check out the mark take up some velvet
moiré mascara if you want the trifecta
lashes aka volume length as well as
definition moving right along to the
four star rated products we are going to
start with the hourglass ambient
lighting edit three of volume palette or
volume three edit palette whatever the
 it's called you guys know this one
right here with the six pans now this is
definitely not for everybody but it is
definitely a four star rated product for
me and this is a wonderful wonderful
palette especially if you do have more
of a fair to medium complexion even if
you do have a tan or deep complexion I
feel like a lot of these shades will
work for you if you're super super super
deep these might look a little ashy on
you unfortunately our glass has a trend
of just not really releasing super dark
shades when it does come to their
powders which is really unnecessary and
I don't like that about them but I will
say I love this I'm a huge sucker for
the ambient lighting formula if you are
willing to spend the $80 I do think this
is worth it but it's not going to be for
everyone I do notice that diffuse light
right here does have a little bit of
glitter in it dim light does not I'm not
a huge fan of the middle shade which
does have kind of like the glitter
particles in it and yeah I've been
noticing that hourglass has been doing
that lately they've been adding more
glitter into their products which I am
NOT a fan of I don't know why they're
going down that route bleached out but
the bronzer in here and the two blushes
are just absolutely stunning so it's
definitely not for everyone if you don't
want a luxury product this is not going
to be for you you can go ahead and pick
up the Becca I play ski glow face
palette or maybe you want to pick up in
the cover FX perfect highlighting
palette maybe
would be a better fit for you if you
don't want to actually splurge on this
there are very very small pans about the
size of a quarter so don't get
twisted thinking you're gonna be getting
some huge pans right here a lot of
people say this is not worth the money
but it all depends on what's worth your
money this is definitely worth my money
I appreciate it I love it and I have
been getting a lot of use out of it are
you moving on to the capo indie saint
and sinner palette also a four star
rated product in my opinion I've been
loving this as far as eyeshadows is
concerned it does have the same side as
well as the center side here is the same
side here is the center side a lot of
people are confused by the overall color
layout going on here but I promise you
can create whole complete looks using
this palette there are brow bone shades
in here there are transitions you get
pops of color you get liner shades like
the dark smoky black as well as crucifix
which is a dark smoky brown color you
have everything that you can need in
here it is obviously not travel friendly
this is a true collector's item but I
personally really like it if you've
never tried Kat Von D shadows before if
they do take a little bit of blending a
little bit of a worker but I feel like
this is one of her better formula so we
would highly recommend the Kat Von D
sentence in her palette moving on we
have the Becca a place key glow face
palette and this is what it looks like
you are getting four different
highlighters in here I'm sorry you are
getting one two three technically three
different highlighters in here a
luminous flush blush as well as a
mineral blush and then of course you are
also getting a Bondi a bronzer which is
one of their new sunlit bronzers
beautiful beautiful palette I do still
prefer my Jaclyn hill palette from the
becca collection that one was called the
champagne collection face palette I know
it's not available anymore but I don't
know there's something about that I feel
like it's very sturdy it's very nice for
travel but not to say this one isn't
it's great for travel you a huge mare
that does prop up by itself so you don't
have to worry about it flopping over I
feel like a lot of people can get use
out of this it is a really wonderful
face palette and the highlighters in
here are pressed a little more firmly
just so that they don't shatter so just
be aware of that ahead of time you know
a lot of people are saying the formula
is different the formula is different I
wouldn't say so much the formula is
different I feel like the pigmentation
is still there the wear time is still
there as far as Becca full-size products
are concerned or their shimmering skin
perfecter press I think for this a
palette they just wanted to make sure
they pressed it a little firm
so that they would not shatter alright
guys and finally in the fourth star
rated category we have the Urban Decay
the new heavy metal palette I hate the
packaging on this it does not travel
friendly whatsoever it's even worse that
the Kat Von D as far as science is
concerned bulkiness is concerned a has a
mirror in the middle it's just the
weirdest thing ever but if you are a
lover of glitter and you want
high-impact a metallic glitter you are
going to love this palette I wouldn't
necessarily say they're super super
glittery but some of them can be a
little more chunky today I do have on
the shade rody
on my lower lash line and then I do have
on Maidan on my lid I know a lot of
people were saying the shade is called
rowdy it's not it's felt ROA di e so I'm
pretty sure it's rowdy but rody or
whatever but anyway if these two shades
are absolutely gorgeous I have this one
on my lower lash line and then this one
right here on my lid definitely work
with a little bit of X + Mac 6 + or any
sort of settings for water whatever you
want to make sure that you foil these or
tap them on with your lid and they are
not something that I feel like is super
super everyday friendly I feel like
today the shades that I'm wearing are a
little more everyday friendly but if
you're not a fan of foiled consistencies
if you're not a fan of kind of chunkier
shadows you're not going to like these
but I still like the really high
metallic eye shine that I get from them
so I would go ahead and give this a 3.5
to 4 star rating alright guys we're
gonna go ahead and move into the 3 star
rated items but I do want to say I also
feel like this little guy right here the
Anastasio Beverly Hills a blush kit in a
radiant I feel like this is definitely
more of a 4 star rated product I forgot
to include it but I feel like this is a
strong 3.5 to 4 star rated product so if
this is what the radiance a blush kit
does look like you get a nice little
mirror as well as 4 different peachy
shades in here they're not necessarily
all super super peachy the two over here
are a little more warm tone the two over
here are a little more cool toned I
think this is a beautiful beautiful
formula very reminiscent of the Anasazi
of Beverly Hills blush trio so if you
write those out before and you love that
silky blendable smooth smooth blush
formula I think you would get a kick out
of this now I think the only downfall is
that they only released two different
shade selections for the holiday season
the deeper one which is called gradient
does have a little more out like
contouring shades in there so maybe if
you do have a very deep complexion you
would want that one but I feel like this
is pretty universally flattering
universally flattering nothing's truly
universally flattering a pipe and you
when it comes to makeup but it's pretty
darn close it is very beautiful all of
these do have a little bit of shine to
them and I'm not saying they have like
straight-up glitter in them but they do
have finely milled shimmer every single
shade so if you only bought matte
blushes this is not going to be for you
but still a very solid formula right
here alright now let's talk about the
true to restart rated products the first
one is the anastacio Beverly Hills prism
matte palette and this just didn't
really get my motor going you know I
think I feel like when it comes to
holiday releases and really really
bright eye shadows my Kat Von D Saint
and sinner definitely swooped it out of
the park this is very similar to the Kat
Von D Saint and sinner I'll go ahead and
throw out my comparison video between
the two of these up in the cards if you
would like to check it out but I feel
like because this doesn't have a huge
amount of mattes in it I have a hard
time with it I feel like I do have to
reach for another palette it's not an
all-in-one kind of inclusive palette if
you're a huge fan of dual Chrome's as
well as metallics that are a little more
spongy and soft to the touch I think you
could go ahead and work these into your
crease as well as your outer V but for
me personally I just don't have that
skill level I have to have mattes when
I'm working with crease colors as well
as when I'm working with brow bones and
transitions and there's just not enough
easier to be completely honest so it's
definitely a palette that I think it's
really really beautiful I think a lot of
people would enjoy this but it's just
not my favorite for the holiday season
so I would give that three stars
I would also give it the Anastacio
Beverly Hills holiday 2017 sugar glow
kit three stars I just feel like the
shades in here are a little more on the
mundane side there are a couple in here
that I've already been seen in different
palettes so you have marshmallow as well
as butterscotch which were in the sweets
glow kit and then over here we have
gumdrop and starburst which are seen in
the gleam glow kit I'm not quite sure if
gumdrop is but starburst definitely is
starburst is what I have on today on my
cheeks it's absolutely beautiful but the
other shades in here besides marshmallow
I'm not that drawn to its a
Monday when you look at it right now
colorful highlights are super super in
for fall and winter 2017 and this is
just not going to need that wham bam
highlight that I want again I feel like
starburst is you guys can see it the
glow is very very beautiful but the
other shades in here just kind of fall
short for me so it's not that it's not a
good formula it is the typical four pan
palette formula when it comes to the
Anasazi of Beverly Hills Glo kits it's
just that I feel like they could have
shaken it up a little bit and do some
more bright shades alrighty guys and
finally we have our two star rated
product as well as our one star rated
product the two star rated products I'm
sorry but these by beauty the liquefied
and Musa Boosh liquid lipsticks are just
not from me I don't absolutely hate them
I am going to use them I'll probably
declutter two of them keep two of them
there are very interesting formula
everything about this I wanted to love
and I really should love but they're
very moisturizing almost too
moisturizing but they feel incredibly
heavy on the lips if you guys didn't
know but beauty is very much into like
beeswax and I already feel like the
amuse-bouche lipsticks although I gave
those a 5 star rating I already feel
like those are a little heavier on the
lips they're not like an air light
lipstick you can feel them there and
these are probably 10 times it's worse
and as someone who is a professional
flutist that is what I do for a living
I'm a teacher as well as a performing
artist for me having that on my lips
first of all these Trent's were like
crazy all over my food head joint but
just the fact that they're so heavy and
I can feel them there I don't like it so
this is definitely very much a personal
preference if you have extremely dry
lips like I do and you want a liquid
lipstick that's going to remain glossy
on the lips I think this is a great
option but they're just not the most
comfortable I also find that these do go
outside of the lip line like crazy so I
have to go ahead and give these a 2 star
rating and finally guys we have our 1
star rated product that is the Tarte got
a slow highlighter I did already return
mine so I will go ahead and insert a
photo right here but this was the worst
highlighter that released for the Fall
for the holiday 2017 season all of the
releases right now when it comes to
highlighters have been pretty darn good
this was horrible you get a huge
amount of product in there I think it
was like 7 or
grams for like $32 but the color wasn't
really that exciting it was kind of like
a yellow weed sort of color it had a ton
of glitter in it I hate glitter infused
highlights I just absolutely hate it I
couldn't feel like I really could like
brush it off so sometimes if I have a
bake she'll a highlight that does have
glitter infused into it I go in with a
more densely packed brush and then I'll
go in and kind of wipe away the glitter
I couldn't do this with this highlight
and also emphasized a ton of texture it
was very drying on the skin it felt like
sandpaper I mean it was one of the worst
highlighters that I think Tarte has ever
released so that is definitely the one
star rated product so anyway guys this
is a longer video there are a lot of
products for me to go through so there
are a few cuts here and there because I
had to you know rearrange my desk area
but I hope you enjoyed this video I do
hope it was helpful to you guys thank
you so much for joining me and I will
see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
