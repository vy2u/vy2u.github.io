have another bhcosmetics hall for you
guys today last time I went on the
website I only picked up a few things
because I wanted to get to know kind of
the brand and if I liked you know the
eyeshadows and whatnot and it turns out
I did so I went back on and purchased a
few more things so here they are the
first thing I picked up was this
neutralized 28 color eyeshadow palette
and I had no idea it was going to be
this big it is really really big you get
lots of neutral shades here a nice black
up here a nice pink there but just all
over really really neutral shades so I'm
excited to try that along those lines
along the same lines of that palette I
got the bhcosmetics 28 color palette
smokey eyes edition so this is just a
little more darker colors it has a few
more like color pops to it and that's
what this one looks like so you get like
a nice red you get some smoky shades
over here some blues so I'm excited to
try that one out again these are so big
I had no idea that we're going to be
this large I'm not quite sure how I'm
going to store those in my collection um
the next thing I got was the bhcosmetics
wild at heart baked eyeshadow palette um
last time I hauled from bhcosmetics i
picked up the wildchild baked eyeshadow
palette and i absolutely loved it i
think the pigmentation is great the
eyeshadows are huge you get a lot of
product for your buck so I picked up
this one as well and I think the shades
are just as gorgeous it comes with this
large mirror too but here are the shades
and I mean the pigmentation is like
extraordinary on these so I highly
recommend picking up these little
pallets they're super key to the next
thing I picked up were two lip glosses I
got one in the color galaxy chic which
is like a purple with little sparkles in
it and i also picked up one in bon bon
which is just this pink color so excited
to try those out along with those i also
wanted to try out some of their lip
liners I got one in raspberry which is a
dark a dark pink color and then I got
one in candy which is a light pink so
we'll see how those work i did swatch
them and they seemed very very very soft
so I'm very excited about that they
glided on like butter the next thing I
picked up with a gel eyeliner in the
color blow this is like a pink gel
eyeliner thought it was really pretty
I'm excited to try that out um I also
picked up this little like utensil this
is supposed to help put on fake
eyelashes I guess it's basically almost
like a little tweezer but I thought it
was cute it's just this dark pink color
so hopefully that will work and I can
start wearing some falsies and the next
thing I picked up was the bhcosmetics
forever nude palette it looks like this
and you get i shadow blush highlighter
and lip color so let me see how can I do
this without blinding you guys so there
is the palette you get the lip colors
here you get I guess blush highlighter
and then the eyeshadows I thought this
looked really pretty and it's like an
all-in-one palette easy to use so I'm
excited to try that out a little more
and the last thing I picked up was the
bhcosmetics professional blush 10 color
blush palette it's really nice and sleek
and this is what it looks like those are
the colors you get I think it's really
versatile this would be easy to travel
with it's really really compact and thin
as you can see it doesn't have a mirror
but these are some beautiful shades so
hopefully they are pigmented anyway that
was my BH Cosmetics hall I hope you guys
enjoyed this give this video a thumbs up
if you did and i'll see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
