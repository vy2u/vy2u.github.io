doing review and swatches on the BH
Cosmetics wild child baked eyeshadow
palette I just reviewed the other one
that I have and I thought I'd just go
ahead and review this one and do some
swatches as well so this is what the
colors look like these are very very
neutral I'm you get a nice like peach in
there I would say these are very very
neutral colors compared to the other
palette that I showed that had more like
pops of color these are the swatches of
what you get and they are highly
shimmery just like the other one and I
think the colors are just beautiful you
get some nice like bronzy colors and
then over here you get this nice like
deep plum color nice highlight color
some coppery stuff over here I would say
there's a few shades in here like this
one and this one that actually don't
show up very well they're not as highly
pigmented as I would have hoped or
thought they would be because of the
whole palette is pretty highly pigmented
but other than that you can see these
ones are a little lacking in
pigmentation but these ones are not and
over here and things like that so really
really love this palette as much as I
love the other one I think the other one
might be a little easier to work with
just because you get a different variety
you get pops of color and things like
that and every single eyeshadow in the
other one is completely pigmented so I
would say out of both of them I
definitely like the wild at heart the
most but this wild child one was the
first one I had and I thought it was
amazing until I got the other one so let
me show you again the shadows if you're
a neutral lover I'd go for this one if
you're a neutral lover and you'd like to
have a pop of color once in a while I'd
go for the other one they also have a
third one on the website I believe which
is like all pops of color and I really
should order that one I would like to
see what it's like but if you're really
just into strictly using colors for your
eyeshadows just all colors then go for
that one they're all 995 I believe on
the website so that is what they look
like again and here are the swatches and
I hope you guys enjoyed this video see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
