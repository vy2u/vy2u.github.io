channel recently I was watching a rich
luxe here on YouTube hit the busted ass
who I loved him so much he is literally
one of my favorite channels you watch
currently oh go ahead and link is
channel down below but in his video he
said something he said I'm bougie on a
budget at all I was like what did I hear
that right
and it really made me think can you be
bougie on the budget and I absolutely
think you can so today I'm going to
share with you guys some drugstore
makeups it really really performs like
high-end makeup if these didn't have
labels on them I don't think I would be
able to differentiate between them being
a drugstore or high-end like that's how
good they are so anyway let's go ahead
and jump right into it the first item I
want to talk about is actually a new
trio that I have been trying out from
elf cosmetics this is one of their new
sculpting silk eyeshadow trios I
recently did an elf haul which I'll go
ahead and throw up in the cards if you
would like to check it out I will be
doing it get ready with me and follow up
haul for you guys probably in the next
week or so on all the products that I
picked up but this particular little
trio right here is called a road day all
a day is what I have on my eyes
currently I am loving loving at this
formula it is very soft - very finely
milled very silky and buttery and
honestly these are just intense and
beautiful so this middle shade right
here I have that kind of worked into my
crease and on my lid and then this
darker purple shade right here which I
really didn't think I was going to like
it's ultra ultra pigmented as you guys
can see but I did think when i swatched
it out it looked a little chalky it
actually went on beautifully to the eyes
today as well and every single day that
I've worn it so really really enjoy
these little trios they are new from elf
cosmetics I think they're 5 or 6 dollars
very affordable very very good products
alright the next item I want to talk
about is a concealer from Maybelline so
and this is the Maybelline and master
conceal this is a very very good product
now I know that Maybelline does test on
animals if you guys would like me to try
and find a cruelty-free view for this I
will let you know but currently I have
it in a project pan I probably have one
or two uses less on this but the shades
that I do wear is called a number 10 a
fair or Claire and it is just absolutely
beautiful I love the consistency I love
the coverage I love that it's not drying
underneath the eyes a lot of people
compare this to a big heart shaped Cape
and I have to say I think I like this
formula better than the heart-shaped
cake so if you are looking for a good at
drugstore concealer and you're not
cruelty free I would highly recommend
that one out alright next we have a wet
and wild Meza blow highlighting powder
as this is I just want to talk about
like the baked shell a formula from wet
and wild like the mecca blow line in
general and not specifically this
particular one but this particular one
is amazing so I have it on at my
cheekbones today which by the way I
think I told you guys I am wearing this
as well today I'm wearing the majority
of these products on my face but this is
called the sweetest bling it's a
gorgeous gorgeous beige late pink sort
of highlight and this is so similar to
my Dior glowing gardens you know glowing
pink highlighter is so similar to my
makeup forever
undetectable Luminizer it's just so
freaking beautiful and honestly if it
didn't have the name wet and wild on
here I wouldn't be able to tell the
difference between this video and the
makeup forever to be completely honest
they're just all so freakin good and
this one is spectacular so what highly
recommend that next we do have a product
from Rimmel this is EC matte liquid and
boost of foundation very very similar to
the Tarte Amazonian clay full coverage
in your cruelty-free go for the tarts if
you're not that this is a good option
the shade I wear is zero one zero like
porcelain it says lightweight shine
control I personally don't feel like
this is super lightweight itself at that
very moody texture to it but it gives
amazing coverage and it really does keep
you matte all day long so that is
definitely something that reminds me of
a high end foundation for sure another
foundation that reminds me of a high end
foundation is the L'Oreal infallible Pro
map I know a lot of people love the pro
glow not a fan of the pro blow but this
pro matte I'm going to be sad when I run
out of this because I know I can't
repurchase and Floreal past but this is
a really really beautiful Demi matte
foundation it looks amazing on the skin
and I mean it looks better than some of
the high-end foundations that I have in
my collection so would highly recommend
back to the shade that I wear is zero
one zero I'm sorry one zero one classic
I've really really nice a beautiful
medium to full coverage
alright next we have a blusher from
Milani I have gone for so many of these
probably four or five like in my
lifetime the actual name is rubbed off
here but this particular shade is called
a 0-5 in Luminoso
there is nothing quite like Luminoso
this will make your cheeks glow it
through the gods it is absolutely
beautiful it has a crazy amount of Sheen
to it but even though it's a baked blush
if it would feel like a baked blush this
formula actually reminds me a lot of
like the hourglass ambient lighting
powder is very light and airy you know
how you go into like a based product you
really always dig off that top layer you
absolutely do not have to do this with
this particular formula so I love this
one I don't love all of the baked
blushes from Milani I think some of them
are really good some of them you have
more chunks or flecks of glitter in
there which I'm not a fan of that this
particular shade is universally
flattering absolutely stunning on so
many different skin tones would highly
recommend to you guys alright next that
we have it's just like a lipstick range
in general I get asked all the time what
is my favorite lipstick range from the
drugstore
unfortunately Revlon does test on
animals but if this is the Revlon Super
Lustrous lipstick line this is my
favorite so this particular shade right
here is called fuchsia fusion is what I
have on my lips today
super super beautiful satin bright pop
of color and these are absolutely
stunning if you have anything that you
think is kind of similar to this
particular formula let me know down
below that is cruelty free because I
can't find anything like this they go on
beautifully they're ultra ultra
pigmented they're very very comfortable
and I am someone who doesn't like liquid
lipsticks I don't like the majority of
regular lipsticks that I find out there
these are so comfortable and beautiful
and honestly a better formula than some
of the urban decay lipsticks I've tried
some of the high-end lipsticks I've
tried would highly recommend it be super
luster Salina from a Revlon alright next
we have a palette here from elf
cosmetics also new to me I am obsessed
with this baby right here so I have this
particular highlights layer together
with the mega Glo illuminating powder
today like that makes like pinky glowy
cheek that you guys are seeing a yeah
that's coming from this and that wet and
wild highlight but this is the elf total
face palette I thought this was called
be beautifully bare palette I think it's
beautifully bare total face a palette it
looks so mundane and it looks so boring
but I swear to you and this is amazing
especially we do have a light complexion
if you have like a porcelain sort of
complexion if you have a deeper
complexion I don't know if every single
shade is really going to show up very
nicely on your skin but overall I would
say that else is really really fantastic
their face palettes are great but these
are incredibly incredibly finely melt
like when I close my eyes and I put my
finger in there I mean it feels like a
Becca cosmetics blush like it really
really does so this is a fantastic
little palette again would highly
recommend to those of you who do have a
spare or light complexion
alright moving on we have a powder here
it was really hard for me to choose a
powder because I feel like I really
don't buy high-end powders because I go
through them very very quickly I do have
combo skin and that's what we are here
at living in the desert in Arizona I've
noticed that my skin has started to go
normal which is crazy but I still do
powder my face every single day I just
feel like the longevity of my foundation
is a lot better when I can set it in so
as the elf tone correcting powder and
cool I have talked about this I've
talked it to the ground I love this a
product right here depending on what
kind of undertone you have you have a
cool undertone can go with this if you
have a warm undertone you can go with
the warm version but this is just such a
finely milled gorgeous a powder on the
skin I cannot find anything like this
and I love my essence all about Matt 16
compact powder I love my Rimmel stay
matte powder but there's something about
this one there's just something about it
I've gone through a bajillion of these
since I've been in college I just
absolutely love these these are
fantastic especially if you have again a
porcelain like kind of complexion if you
are a little more of like a medium
complexion use a light hand with this
just because that is kind of like I
don't know I guess the blue courtrand
over here can leave a little bit of an
ashen look on your skin and if you have
a very very deep complexion you might
want to go with the borma version but
this is a fantastic powder you guys I'm
in love with it and it's only three
dollars which is incredible alright next
we have another foundation here this is
from a covergirl this is BCG smoothers
hydrating makeup I feel like nobody ever
talks about this the shade I wear is
7:05 ivory I feel like I've gone through
three or four of $0.08 college this is
beautiful absolutely beautiful on the
skin it actually kind of mimics the look
of the Armani luminous silk foundation
which is one a big claim over here
because I love that foundation I've
never been able to find anything that is
identical to that foundation but this
guy right here really gives that
beautiful amount of coverage it has the
same sort of texture is runny but it's
not like a little bit of buoyancy to it
I guess you could say but at the same
time because it is hydrating and has
those hydrating properties it sits on
the skin in a really really nice
beautiful dull life sort of look so even
when you set it in with powder you're
not going to get dry patches it's not
going to you're not going to notice any
texture anything like that this is a
very special foundation from the
drugstore in Maya
and I really really do enjoy that so
definitely I prefer that over a lot of
high-end foundations I actually have in
my collection to be completely honest
all right next we have a product here
from wet and wild this is a little color
icon single in nutty and this was they
do for Mac satin so I know that because
I have gone through three of Mac satin
chokes I'm not a huge fan of a Mac
anymore but when I was in a college I
used to use a satin taupe all the time
in my crease like that was my go-to
thing this is an exact you for it it's
also we do for the Burberry single in
the shade like linen sheets or something
like that but this is absolutely
beautiful as you guys see that and let
me tell you damn these are like $0.99
the feel the feel on these are
incredible they have a variety of
different shades I know some people were
saying that these actually are not sold
anymore but I recently saw them here in
Arizona I saw them I can get Walmart and
also Target so I think you can still get
them up but yeah these are silky they
are buttery you get any sort of shade
you want but this is my particular
favorite right here also a brulee or
creme brulee up so good such a beautiful
base color just to put all over the lid
before you go on with your transition
shade I would HIGHLY highly recommend
dewetting wild color icons candles
alright and then finally we have the
Garnier skin renew a dark circle roller
as well as the Maybelline master prime
eyeshadow base so let's go ahead and
starts with this eye primer right here
my favorite eye primer in my collection
I know that Maybelline tests on animals
but this is my favorite I will not
repurchase but I have never found
anything quite like this my issue with
eye primers is just that I feel like the
majority of the times they're too sticky
they're too tacky sometimes I love a
good glitter glue or you know whatever
but there's something about this
particular primer as you guys can see I
wear the lightest shade it has a little
bit of like a sheen to it it just keeps
my eyeshadows on all day it doesn't
crease but at the same time it does have
a little bit of slip to it it's not
sticky now a lot of people don't they
look for a really nice sticky tacky
eyeshadow base and that's really good if
you want your eyeshadow to last all day
if you want it to be extremely extremely
beautiful and vibrant all day yes and
look for one that's very tacky but if
you just want to get up and go in the
morning it's very hard to blend your
eyeshadow on top of it and extremely
extremely
key or sticky eyeshadow base so I like
to reach for something like this
especially when I'm working with
something like the modern renaissance
palette or something super super buttery
and blendable I can literally get an eye
looking like two minutes which is
amazing so I love this eye primer if you
guys know of a cruelty free dupe
definitely let me know and finally like
I said I had the garden a dark circle
and a dark circle roller skin at renew I
never talked about this I never talk
about this because I'm pretty damn salty
that I can't repurchase this because
guarde does tests on animals so and this
is in the shade fair and it is a little
too dark for me but I this is I think my
sixth one
I do tally up how many products I've
gone through if you guys want to see
like my list or something where I talk
about like my most repurchase makeup
items let me know but anyway and this is
just really really nice I have tried a
lot of products from Sephora that are
kind of like the rollerball technology
so it's almost like skincare and makeup
in one and nothing is as good as this
and like I said it happens kind of like
orange a peachy color to it and I feel
like I'm almost on the last leg of the
race with this guy and at first when I
start blending it down like oh this
looks horrible it looks horrible but
then you put your foundation on top and
it looks amazing this is all that I have
on today appear together with my urban
decay and Naked Skin Foundation and I
love how canceled out those dark circles
it helps with puffiness because it does
have the cool little rollerball in there
and I just really really like the look
that it gives to my skin so this is
definitely a product that I feel like
performs like a high-end makeup product
as well so anyway guys I hope this video
was helpful I hope you would maybe have
some do a boo she's picks from the
drugstore that you want to go ahead and
pick up hopefully it was helpful for
those of you are cruelty free and I
suppose you who are not cruelty free let
me know if you would like a second
edition of this I haven't unpacked all
of my makeup yet so I'm sure there are
some other products from the drugstore
that really do for more like high-end
products and I could definitely do a
part Q but yeah that's pretty much it
and I guess I will see you guys tomorrow
