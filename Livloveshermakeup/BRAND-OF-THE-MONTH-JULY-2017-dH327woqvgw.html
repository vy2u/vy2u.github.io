channel today I am here to share brands
of the month with you guys if you do not
know what brands up the month is and
this is basically where I talk about my
most reach for brand for this particular
month so we are here for July 2017 and
guess what the brand of the month is
hard to cause medics I feel like I never
in a million years would have said that
but there is a reason why to our
cosmetics is the brand of the month so
as I was unpacking all of my makeup in
this new a beauty room I specifically
took all of my makeup and basically skin
care products from charts and put them
in one gigantic baby pile now I feel
like when I go into my collection at the
last brands that I reach for really
truly nowadays it's like to face and
tart I really don't reach for their
stuff all that often I am more prone to
reaching for better products I'm more
prone to reaching for anasazi of Beverly
Hills products and I want to make sure
absolutely using these products if I
have them in my collection sure I don't
have to repurchase them but I want to
make sure I'm using them so I had a big
pile of Tarte cosmetics products and
guess what there are some that I really
really have been loving this week so let
me share with you not this week this
month that I have been loving so let me
share with you guys the ones that I have
been adoring so the first one is
definitely the charts in maracuja oil I
have gone through quite a few full sizes
of this it is a beautiful thick oil I
would see the consistency reminds me a
lot of avocado oil so if you've ever
tried Alva coddle you know it's super
super thick now I enjoy taking 2 to 3
drops of this and mixing it into my
marula facial lotion this was sent to me
for a PR probably about 6 to 8 months
ago is from the john hall select brand
it's just okay as a moisturizer but what
I like is taking a thicker oil mixing it
in with this sort of lotion which is
like a thinner consistency I love what
this does for my skin it gets the
perfect amount of hydration I just think
it's really beautiful you can also mix
this into your foundation that would be
a little on the terrible side because it
is so thick when we use like half a drop
or one drop but yeah really have been
enjoying that I also have been enjoyed
my Tarte light in bloom a palette if
there is one palette I would recommend
from Tarte cosmetics it is the in bloom
and I haven't been using every single
shade in here this particular month I
keep wanting to say week this particular
month
I have been using as these three shades
right here or just row right here so and
that row consists of jetsedder smarty
pants and sweethearts they are all
really really nice transitions if you do
have more of like a fair to medium
complexion I've been taking a lot of
sweet heart lately which is just a
beautiful kind of peachy pinky matte
color and mixing that together with my
color pop yes please polish because the
transition shape in the color pop yes
please palette unfortunately is a little
on the darker side and I feel like I'm
actually just placing like a dark
eyeshadow in my crease so I've been
reaching for this palette a lot I think
it's beautiful great quality and yes I
will be picking up the toasted version
as well if you guys are curious
the next product I've been loving is my
tarts Queen Queen at vegan deodorant
this has been a favorite ever since I
purchased the first one this is my
second one I've ever had it smells
amazing it's really really nice as a you
know vegan deodorant or just like a
natural deodorant in general it has the
best scent and definitely the best
texture one thing I noticed with like
the Schmitz deodorant as well as the
lava nila deodorant is sometimes they
can get this hard sort of layer on top
of them you kind of have to put it on
your armpit wait for it to warm up and
then kind of melt it into your skin this
is always smooth it always goes on
really really beautifully and it is free
of aluminum so I really like this a lot
of people were asking me do you actually
like it because they are coming from
like an antiperspirant to a natural
deodorant when you first switch to a
natural deodorant you are going to
 hate it because unfortunately it
goes on and it will not take care of a
ton of wetness protection but it will
help with stink or like your stanky
armpits you know what I mean so I really
like it for that I used to use the Dove
antiperspirant and can this do what that
does absolutely not but this is free of
aluminum if you have an autoimmune
disease so I'm supposed to be careful
with aluminum and Yoast is something I
really enjoy so just be careful when you
first started yes you're going to have a
little bit of issues because it's not
the same as these other antiperspirant
on the market but it is better for your
body alright now I do have two of the
Amazonian clay highlighters these are
the Amazonian clay 12-hour highlighters
indi shades
Center which looks a little something
like this as well as the shade exposed
so I do love exposed the most I made
quite a dent on this particular one it's
just a beautifully nude sort of
highlight stunner definitely have a
little more of cool tones going on maybe
a little more like
opalescent white finish to it now these
are very very creepy I will say these
Thunder state is a little more on the
chunky side when they first released the
original exposed which this one right
here is the original this was just so
creamy and did medical like it is so
smooth to the touch and then they
release two new shades and it's a
different formula but on top we do have
a stunner and then right there we do
have it be shade and exposed and I just
think they're really really beautiful
exposed it's a really nice match for my
skin tone currently and if you wear all
day long I wouldn't necessarily say
they're glittery or chunky there wasn't
one of them which I tried out called
sparkler which was very chunky I
returned that but these are really
beautiful and I like them a lot
and then right in the middle of those
you guys could see an actual swatch of
the next products I want to talk about
or the last product I want to talk about
this is the Tarte Amazonian clay 12-hour
blush indie shade it's sensual now you
guys know I really do like the Amazonian
clay formula
hence the eye shadow palette the two
different highlighters in the sky right
here when they are made here in the US
and there's very good quality they are
really awesome blushes they stay on all
day they are a little more firmly
pressed you don't get kind of kick off
and I just feel like they really melt
into your skin and stay on like a tattoo
all day long so anyway this particular
sheet is called its sensual and I don't
feel like it really does any justice in
the pan it looks like it would be really
muted nude color but I actually have a
lot of interesting almost like to know
is it like neutral undertones got like a
little bit of a warm undertone a little
bit of like a pinky undertone it's got
that perfect neutral undertone and I
actually prefer this overexposed blush
now I did declutter the expose blush
just because I didn't feel like it was
great on my skin tone but this one right
here is a really good shade it is from
the naughty news collection they also
have the one called to do is for this
one like I said is sensual and then they
have something else but this one right
here has been my favorite so anyway guys
benefit for brands of the month like I
said Tarte cosmetics has been on my go
to mostly because I had a pile out it
was just a Jonah star cosmetics products
but those other products that have been
at my absolute favorite from the brand I
hope you guys enjoyed this video as
always thank you for joining me and I'll
see you guys tomorrow right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
