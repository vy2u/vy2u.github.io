to my channel today's video is going to
be a new series on my channel yes
another new series I want to do once a
month a video where I talk about my
favorite brand of the month either a
brand much relieved in impressing me a
brand that has new releases that have
really been impressing me something I'm
really excited about I'm kind of the
queen of talking about brands and
sometimes I don't have good things to
say I'm a very honest person I'm very
straightforward and I just like to give
it to you guys how I like to serve it
you know if I'm not happy with something
I will let you know but that doesn't
mean that I don't love brands or that I
don't love makeup I obviously do I would
not have a channel like this if I didn't
love makeup if I didn't love purchasing
products so today we're going to be
talking about brand as a month for junit
2017 and that brand is as becca
cosmetics i have been absolutely
obsessed with becca cosmetics this past
month all of their new releases lately
have been a top notch my biggest
complaint with becca cosmetics is i feel
like they do way too much
limited-edition stuff which i will be
doing my limited-edition my house video
for you guys very soon as these are
going to be next week or the week after
i just have to make sure that rochelle
is able to moderate and we can kind of
set up a good date for that but yeah
becca cosmetics have been a brand i've
been so freaking excited about this
month and actually the whole month of
May as well so it all kind of started
with the Becca Christiana palette this
is what it looks like I have been
wearing this on my eyes on my face for
probably I would say 18 out of a 30 days
like this past month literally I just
love this palette I think it is such a
beautiful quality such a good talent and
if it's still available I would highly
recommend you jump on it so this is what
the outer packaging looks like and on
the inside you do have two different
highlights in here you have a bronzer
and then you have a blush so I have a
beeshees rose gold as well as this guy
right here which is called hibiscus
bloom on my eyes today and then on my
actual cheeks I have this guy right here
which is a bronzer this particular
bronzer is called Malibu Soleil and when
I first got this palette I thought this
bronzer was going to be way too dark for
me it is a very very cool tone to have a
little bit of almost like a yellow
undertone though so I guess it makes it
more in the neutral category because
kind of cool tone kind of warm tone
I have been loving this I thought it was
going to be way too dark for me but this
has been something that I've really been
enjoying so that is what Malibu Sully
looks like I had that on my face today
and then I see to go in with the blush
in there like I said which is hibiscus
bloom and then I followed it up with one
of the new Becca Lite sheets or
highlighters for face and eye this
particular sheet is called amethyst
flashes in geode I've been obsessed with
these these are great I really think
these are good quality I know a lot of
people really like these a lot of people
did not like these I am keeping four out
of the six that I purchased I did have
every intention of keeping all six but
unfortunately these just don't work as
well on the eyes as I would like them to
you so I'm just keeping four of them but
this particular shade right here makes
for one of the most luscious and
beautiful blush top recipe you have a
fair complexion so I have that layered
today on the top of a - hibiscus bloom
shade and again this has been something
that I've been obsessed with this month
I've been loving these highlights I
really really love the pearl flashes
gold shade as well all really beautiful
but just overall Becca has been
impressing me a lot a lot a lot a lot
another product that I have really been
enjoying is there a mineral blush and
you shade songbird so this kind of gives
me those more warm tone divides again
and I'm going to be doing a video for
you guys where I share my Becca
flying-saucer collection aka my
shimmering skin perfecter press my
poured versions my mineral blush is my
luminous flushed blushes it's just one
of those things where it's super super
cute because as you guys can see they
look like little flying saucers but I've
just been so impressed and I've been so
happy with all of my backup products I
thought it would be a good time to go
ahead and share my collection and do
swatches for you guys as well so here is
the shade of songbird which is a
beautiful warm tone bronzy shade with a
ton a ton a ton of beautiful gorgeous
golden shimmer in here and I love the
way that this looks on the cheeks it
almost is a little too pigmented to be
completely honest there is a one swipe
swatch as you guys can see here is the
highlight and then here is the blush I
feel like a lot of better products tend
to be super super pigmented
what I like to do with this again is go
ahead and kind of blend the two of these
together which I'll show you what the
two of them look like blended together
really really gorgeous kind of that a
nice salmony sort of color on the cheeks
but also I like to use a very very
fluffy brush with this and just go in
and kind of glaze my cheek area
now because this does have that nice
terracotta sort of a warmth to it I also
can bring it around the outer perimeters
of my face and I just I just been loving
this I was loving it this a blush and
then finally I do have another product
here from Becca that I've been obsessed
with it is another larger a flying
saucer as you can see this is a
shimmering skin perfecter press a new
shade of moonstone I love moonstone
moonstone is a nice soft opalescent
yellowy kind of color it has a little
bit of a mixture of like pearl in it so
it's kind of neutral but at the same
time you have that little bit of a
yellow shift to it it's gorgeous it's
stunning on the skin I'm someone who
pulled a very strong cool undertone but
I still think this is absolutely
beautiful I have it on today and yes
just been enjoying the out of it so
I wanted to share with you guys as a
brand the eye ability most impressed
with it this past month and actually
kind of the brand that I've been
impressed with is the most like all the
way throughout May I just think the new
releases right now are talk right
now from Becca honestly they've been
releasing some really good stuff I
haven't been feeling like they've been
releasing products that are subpar the
one thing I wish they would work on
again and that limited-edition thing
just make everything permanent and it's
as far as I'm concerned I understand
that obviously not everything will sell
as well but when you're making really
good products like this I feel like they
can go ahead and make them permanent but
anyway that is pretty much it this is my
brand of the month definitely been Becca
cosmetics let me know down below which
Ren you have been enjoying this month
and I will see you guys tomorrow for an
empty hall bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
