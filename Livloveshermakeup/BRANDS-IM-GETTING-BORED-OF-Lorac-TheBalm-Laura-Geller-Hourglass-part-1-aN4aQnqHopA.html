my channel today's video is going to be
all about brands that are just a little
too consistent and not in a good way
what I mean by that is brands that have
kind of fallen into a rut they don't
really change up their formulas a lot
they know what they're good at and they
can sistent we just do that and I mean
out of the girl who does the consistent
versus unreliable makeup brand series
okay I'm all for a brand being
consistent but I do believe that there
is a line and sometimes you can be
overly consistent and it just gets
boring eats some of these brands I'm
going to show you guys just bore me now
so I would like to see them do something
different whether it be with shade
selection formula color range whatever
it's just I would like to see something
new I do believe that the brands that
I'm going to show you in this video
could do it well I feel like tart and
two-faced they try new all the time
and it's like half-assed these brands I
really do believe could make it work so
the first one I want to talk about is
hourglass hourglass is such a consistent
brand but man they need to work on like
shade selection so the first thing I
want to talk about is like their 2016
holiday palette I feel like people get
so excited about their holiday palace
first of all they charge you an arm and
a leg this is $80 well worth it for
someone like me who has a fair to light
complexion but if you have a medium
complexion this isn't going to work for
you and even the 2015 pallets still was
super super light i swatched it on my
friend Senora and she was like what the
hell is this like I can't wear any of
this so I want to see them make this but
like three different palettes does that
make sense you have a light version a
medium version and a dark version so
that everybody can have a little taste
of their best known products and that's
another thing I want to talk about is
that they know that they are best or
well known for these guys right here
they're you know would expose your blush
and you know ethereal light ambient
lighting powder the strobing powders I
would like to see them do more stuff you
know maybe some more lip stuff or a
mascara eyeliners you know more eye
shadow palettes I really liked the
modernist eyeshadow palettes I know a
lot of people didn't but I personally
did so I would like to see them branch
off and create more colors of things and
also just in general like their skin tan
I think there's like four different
shades you can choose from that is so
silly and this is like a very expensive
product and I'm just like why would
people want to buy it if they can't even
find their shade so I think they need to
work on shade selection and all
uh you know maybe just a branch off a
little bit I know that they're amazing
when it comes to their powders but maybe
try something new all right the next
brand I want to talk about is a little
rock I feel like lorac does a lot of
stuff that's not the pro formula and to
be completely honest it's the pro
formula that keeps me going back to the
brand this is the lorac mega pro 3 and
the pro formula is just insane you guys
the mattes feel exactly like the
shimmers there's never been an eyeshadow
palette where I put my finger in the
matte and then I close my eyes on I put
under shimmer I'm like oh they feel
identical no they have this like formula
down to a tee it's amazing so what I
would like to see is I know that they
just release like the I love brunch
which is supposedly the pro formula I've
seen people say that the ingredients
listed are like completely different
than what you usually get in here I
would like to see like an a jewel toned
palette I would like to see something
with just all bright colors instead of
like pastels I led to the thought of the
brunch palette but I didn't purchase it
because I can't see myself really
wearing pastel so maybe jewel tones or
something like that
Urban Decay have a great example of a
brand that consistently like surprises
you they're like oh yeah we can do the
naked palettes but we can ask to do like
the electric palette you know they go
all over the place and in return that
means more people buying their products
so I think it would be really smart of
the rock to go ahead and just keep
consistently releasing the lorac mega
Pro surge I got the mega Pro is just the
pro formula in general and also the mega
pros they just shouldn't be limited
edition they should just be permanent to
the collection in my opinion all right
the next round I want to talk about is
Laura Geller another Laura Geller is
such a boring brand to me like as basic
as they can be I think the thing that
really turns me off about them is the
bake thing and I know that that's their
thing that is literally what they pride
themselves on they like bake their
products in Italy or whatever but
there's something about it that just
seems so old-fashioned and when I think
of something baked I think of like okay
something crispy to the touch and I
don't want to think that when I'm
talking about a bronzer or when I'm
talking about a blush so I mean I love
the word bitch today I mean that's like
my favorite thing but just baked by
itself makes me think of some really
scratchy disgusting eyeshadow and
honestly the eyeshadows that I have
tried from laura geller have been really
really bad in my opinion I really don't
have any palettes from her anymore and I
just I'm just not impressed but they did
recently really
this probably about a year ago is the
beach Matt baked hydrating bronzer and
sunrise fair and this is really really
smooth and creamy to the touch I really
really do enjoy it but even like her
liquid foundation has like baked
particles and I'm just sick of seeing
the word bates like do something
different I would love to see that they
come out with a really really bright
palette or something like that
I just I'm sick of the baked shadow
thing I find that baked eyeshadows are
very difficult to work with anyway
they're very very chalky and you really
can't get a lot of pigmentation so I
would just like to see them kind of
phase out of the big thing even though I
know it's their thing alright and the
last friend I want to talk about is the
balm cosmetics I love the balm cosmetics
I love their highlighters I love their
blushes but why can't they release more
shades like come on come on what are
they working on they're doing all these
like lip products and they released like
24 different shades I'm like come on I
want 24 more of these these are so good
this one right here is hot mama this is
a dupe for Narses orgasm this is what it
looks like and adorable adorable
packaging the time and the thought they
put into these is so good here is frat
boy which is like a really nice kind of
peachy shade and then we also have down
boy which is more of a cool tone pink I
just love this like I think they come up
with good colors I just want to see more
of them like more of them and I know
that the insane blush on collection has
like 12 different shades but 12 is not
enough why not 24 when they know that
they're doing so well with those I
haven't really seen people get that
excited about like their liquid
lipsticks and stuff and there are I
products in general I know their palates
do somewhat well but I feel like their
face products are what they are known
for and in this case I'm like hourglass
um in this case I do feel like they
should just open the shade selection up
Marcus like if they're doing so well
with this I don't feel like they can get
any more consistent like this is just
really really good quality here so they
should just continue doing that because
from what I've noticed it seems like
people don't get nearly as excited about
their other products like I've seen
people do PR hauls of like their lip
products and all this kind of stuff but
they're known for
Marylou cindy-lou betty-lou and their
blushes and maybe for them it would be
better just to stick to that so anyway
that is it for this video I hope you
guys enjoyed it definitely let me know
down below go ahead and name a brand
that you find extremely consistent to
the point where it's like I'm bored I
will definitely do a part 2 for you guys
you know it's pretty much it I'll see
you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
