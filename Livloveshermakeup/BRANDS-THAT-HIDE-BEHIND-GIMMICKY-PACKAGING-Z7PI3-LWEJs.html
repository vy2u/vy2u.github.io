welcome back to my channel today's video
is going to be all about brands that
hide behind gimmicky packaging now and
this is something that a lot of beauty
brands are guilty of when it comes to
pushing their products out as well as
just advertisement of their products but
there are definitely some brands where I
feel like if you were to strip away this
packaging what you have on the inside is
really not that spectacular or not that
special so let's go ahead and jump right
into it and if it is an interesting
brand because they take a very very
different approach when it comes to
advertising and their products some of
their advertisements are just like what
the are you thinking I'm gonna go
ahead and insert some photos here so you
guys can see but this first one
obviously says skip class not concealer
and then this one right here you can see
it's like from yuck - Wow and it's
basically showing a girl who has glasses
and her hair up and then you know she
basically puts the makeup on and well we
cured her vision ain't no cure bad
vision and now she's excellent right so
they're very known for doing some really
really kind of controversial advertising
I'm sure they know what they're doing
but in my opinion as a woman who is 25
years old that is definitely going to
strike a younger audience the wrong way
so you get this really really gimmicky
packaging like buy me buy me oh my god
it's amazing but honestly their products
are kind of shitty in my opinion and
their box blushes I love them have like
an overspray to them although they do
alas a rather long time you cannot go
and purchase them in a palette form
because unfortunately the ingredients
are usually different if they repurchase
I'm sorry they repurpose and they
repackage a lot of their different
products as well and I know a lot of
people are not a fan of that now you
could say the same thing about Becca
cosmetics with like the blushes and
bronzers every single palette they
release is the same as sort of color a
blush as well as bronzer but the
difference with Becca is that they have
very subtle and classy packaging I like
that packaging when it comes to benefit
I feel like they're all in your face
when it comes to their advertising as
well as their packaging and I personally
am NOT a fan are you guys moving on to a
glam glow but I'm closed a little bit of
a controversial brand and I feel like
lately a lot of people have been calling
glam glow out I'm not gonna lie to you
guys I used to really really like their
massive when I was not cruelty free like
I said I've only been cruelty free for
12 months so I do still have a few
glencoe products in my collection but
one of the products that really really
strikes me the wrong way is they have
this tinted moisturizer and it's just
filled with shimmer and then they come
out with this glitter mask and it just
kind of makes you think you know okay I
love the way this looks and I get to
that you know two-face brought out their
glow job and now they have a glitter
mask and it's all about gimmicky
packaging right it's all about oh my god
that's so weird
let me put it on my face or oh it's got
glitter let me put it on my face but the
fact of the matter is that this is
not good for your skin a lot of the
ingredients in glam glow products are
not actually good for your skin you know
you get that instant gratification sort
of result which is why I personally feel
like a lot of people are drawn to the
brand but at the end of the day they are
all about gimmicky packaging and
honestly the ingredients list in their
products is not that fantastic
it would not be a video without a
mentioning Too Faced I'm sorry but a lot
of two-faced products are definitely
incredibly incredibly gimmicky some of
their gimmicky products are really good
like their chocolate bar palette but
some of their gimmicky products like
their peach collection the majority of
their peach collection is not that great
I do like a few products from the peach
collection and I do it like quite a few
products from Too Faced in general but I
would love to see them just come back to
basics and do some nice and matte
palettes I would love to see them do
some more 9 pantalets a lot of their
stuff is so gimmicky and you can tell
immediately immediately hey I'm not
gonna want to buy that because it's all
packaging and they put so much effort
and time into the packaging and a draws
you and it's cute it smells good
you want it and then you get it home and
you realize oh my god this is like every
other Too Faced palette that I own in my
collection so definitely have to go
ahead and add to face onto this list and
the next one I want to talk about is
first alia Mercalli is one of those
brands I am on their PR list and I feel
like I'm probably gonna get kicked off
after this video but I don't really
 care so personally is it
necessarily super gimmicky I feel like
they're names for their products are
very gimmicky you know I like the jelly
bean highlighter I think that sounds
really cool and just the way it looks
and just the fact that it's different
yeah I want to purchase it I'm really
really into it about the rose gold
elixir and the unicorn tears sort of
essence you know a lot of their products
especially skincare related are not
actually that great they're kind of like
glam glow now these are products that I
would use as a primer like their oil
their rose gold elixir I used to mix
into my foundations their unicorn
essence I would use as a primer I would
never
these actual skincare products you can
see with the unicorn essence that you
get all this shimmer in there and
they're really really going for the fact
that like oh my god this is a unicorn
tears kind of product it smells like
marshmallow it's pink it's got shimmer
in it and you're thinking oh my god this
is so good for my skin it's not good for
your skin girlfriend okay obviously this
is a very very gimmicky of brand but at
the same time you know they really
really kind of market themselves that
way and that's how they were kind of
founded and that's how people know of
them ads you know you can see the girls
on Instagram kind of putting it on to
their skin like this so it's one of
those products where definitely their
packaging and the names for their
products specifically are incredibly
incredibly gimmicky I wouldn't say that
all of their products are mediocre
because I actually do like the unicorn
Akira's serum as a primer again now
there's a skincare product but as a
primer but besides that I wouldn't
really say that they have anything too
spectacular in their line and I know I'm
getting kicked off the PR list
alright guys finally I have to bring up
Milka makeup I feel like I'm always
constantly crushing milk makeup and they
do suck you some PR packages before and
I tried out the blurring stick I tried
out the cooling water stick I don't
really understand the whole stick thing
am I the only person here that's like
what's going on with this I personally
feel like this is incredibly unsanitary
and so many people are into it they're
into the stick and rubbing it on your
face the green tea toner the cooling
water stick the blur stick but I'm the
only person over here thinking this
can't be that sanitary it just
can't be right you're rubbing this
product on and so basically what I
usually do is I will wipe it down with
the tissue or even some sort not a
washcloth do and drive it down with the
tissue or I will wipe it down with a
paper towel after each use but then I
find then I go through the products so
quickly some of the pricing for some of
these sticks is ridiculous or going up
to like the $35 mark I just find their
packaging incredibly incredibly a
gimmicky and I feel like if that wasn't
in stick form a lot of people would not
actually buy those products so anyway
those are brands I hide behind gimmicky
packaging of course in just in my
opinion I'm a conspiracy please let me
know down below if you have any brands
you would like to add to this list if
you agree with me if you disagree and I
guess I will see you guys tomorrow
for a giveaway bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
