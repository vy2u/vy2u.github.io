hope you are all having a wonderful
friday this video is going to be the
busted out for fall tag I was tagged by
my friend Lisa Stevens here on YouTube I
will of course have her video and her
channel listed down below it will be the
first thing that you see in the
description box also if you guys know
who created this type please let me know
down below in the comments section so I
can go ahead and also credit them in the
actual description bar I really want to
tag absolutely anybody who wants to do
this I don't have anybody specific in
mind so if you want to do this tag
please go ahead and do it and also let
me know in the comments section if you
are going to do it so that I can check
out your video alright so there are 12
different questions they obviously are
fall related so let's go ahead and get
right into it the first one is does the
change of the seasons effect which
makeup you wear for me personally
absolutely it does I would say the
biggest change is definitely like my
face space during the summertime I wear
a lot of serum and water foundations as
well as BB creams and CC creams and then
during the winter months I wear a lot
more full coverage foundation so this is
a good example of something I would wear
during the warmer months the Cielo aqua
glow serum foundation my shade is fair
if you are curious and then during the
winter months I like to bust out like my
Revlon Colorstay by Kat Von D
foundations things that have just a
little more coverage I guess you could
say number two is what is the technique
that you never do in the summer but you
start doing in the fall I also related
to foundations I start to put a lot of
oil into my foundation so you can mix
together one or two drops into a fuller
coverage foundation and it really will
help so that you don't look too dry and
matt i do have combination skin so i
tend to get very oily during the summer
very dry during the wintertime so that's
definitely something that I like to do
number three what color combinations do
you pair together only in the fall i
would say red and gold I never wear like
red and gold together during the
summertime or even the springtime I will
do something like a like burnt orange
kind of color during the summertime but
for the most part I really do feel like
red and gold or something that I pair
together only during the winter and fall
time alright so the next question is
does your hair or skin change with the
seasons and how does that affect your
routine absolutely like i said i have
combo skin so i'm very oily during the
summertime and then I
to kind of add more moisture into my
routine for my skin during the
wintertime and as far as hair is
concerned again I don't have to use as
many dry shampoos because during the
summertime my scalp is super oily and
then during the winter it gets a lot
more dry as well so I make sure that I
use the deep conditioner practically
every single time that I wash my hair
alright moving on at question number
five what color are you most excited to
wear on your face I would definitely
have to say like a deep lip so right
here I have the Urban Decay shame
lipstick I really love wearing a really
nice vampy lip during the fall time so I
would say a color like this which is a
deep berry I also have a nice brown
color here from Revlon this is the super
lustrous lipstick line in the shade
choke aholic which is a beautiful brown
color these are colors that I just think
of like fall these just speak fall to me
so I love those and then of course a red
lip is something that I always try and
rock out to during the fall and winter
months and here is a little marc jacobs
creme lipstick in a red shade so those
are colors that i tend to reach bored
during the fall months i do you know i
will reach for these colors during the
summertime but for the most part i kind
of reserved these colors for the fall
months alright next question is what
nail polish do you love to wear in the
fall I do have one that I'm obsessed
with this is the butter london nail
lacquer in the shade shag do you guys
see that it is so beautiful it is
basically like a burnt orange e coppery
color but it's got a lot of reddish
tones and also bronze tones in here I
think it's absolutely perfect for the
fall and I really should go ahead and
put that on my nails right now alright
moving on the next question is what
blush do you reserved only for fall at
first I was like I don't think I've
reserved a certain blush for fall but
actually I do it is definitely the it
cosmetics CC radiance ombre blush and
the sheet is called sugar plum at any
time I read the back of that I'm like
that is strictly for fall and winter
time but this is what the actual color
looks like it is one of the ombre blush
it's you do have like a highlighter gold
shade up here and then it works down
into this berry shade and I don't know
what the deal is but i really only wear
this during the cooler months i think
it's probably the name and also just the
color but the color is a little more on
the ashy side it's really beautiful if
you do have a cool undertone but I
the shade I think it's beautiful and
that is definitely a blush that I
reserved only for the cooler months all
right the next question is what is your
favorite fall fragrance so if you had
asked me last year it definitely would
have been these sweet cinnamon pumpkin
body mist I wish they have this in
perfume form from Bath and Body Works I
love this fragrance it's really weird i
don't like this in three mocambo form
but i do like it in the spray so i would
have said this it's just a really nice
blend of like sweet pumpkin with a
little bit of cinnamon but this year it
definitely has been my Elizabeth and
James Nirvana bourbon person op Nirvana
it's just the Bourbon perfume I adore
this I am wearing it today my only
complaint is this is that this doesn't
last very long on the actual skin I feel
like the Nirvana black and white
perfumes last a lot longer but this is
still absolutely beautiful I love the
packaging and it just smells so like
fall and winter like it's really really
good very very nice woodsy kind of scent
all right number nine is there a piece
of clothing that's been unborn all
summer that you can't wait to bust out
of your closet for sure for me it's
infinity scarves I love infinity scarves
I bust them out during the fall and also
during the wintertime all of that time
all right number 10 what is the makeup
item that really gets you into the fall
spirit for me personally I would have to
say my Anasazi of Beverly Hills modern
renaissance i shadow palette this is
just like the epitome of fall you have
so many nice kind of like reddish and
berry shades in here as well as some
nice like mustard and like yellow tones
and I just feel like this looks like the
color of leaves sorry they fall time
like honestly you have yellows you have
some like auburn sort of colors you have
some pretty pinky and like warmer tones
some orange colors just really beautiful
this definitely gets me in the mood and
this is something that I need to bust
out in the next couple of weeks to wear
on my actual eyes and the next question
is what makeup item are you going to put
away until spring / summer 2660 a spring
/ summer 2017 that you are the most sad
about for me personally it is the Urban
Decay electric palette I recently
purchased this and I have wanted this
forever it recently went on sale so I
purchased it and it just happened to be
like at the end of August that it was on
sale this is not a palette that I would
personally wear during like the fall and
winter months but
definitely beautiful for these free and
summertime there are a few shades in
here that you definitely could like
spoke out on your lower lash line that
would be very pretty like these shades
slow burn which is right there are some
of these purples um and maybe like a
blue color and also this color would be
beautiful for like New Year's Eve but
for the most part these are very like
spring and summer colors so this is
definitely something that's going to be
stained in my collection even though I
haven't really got a lot of use out of
it it is definitely going to be
something that's going to be staying in
my collection until the spring and
summertime but I don't mind because i
got it for such a great discounted price
alright and the last question is let's
see here are there any other makeup /
beauty items that you're going to bust
out for the fall do you haven't talked
about so an item that I feel like I
don't talk about very often are these
beautiful little Lancome blush subtil
pallets so I have two of them and i
bushed i bust these out all the time
during the fall and winter months so the
first one is called 126 nectar lace this
is what the shades look like you do have
a nice soft contour a really nice soft
highlight and then a beautiful blush in
the middle and this particular blush I
feel like is the epitome of fall it's
like a gorgeous kind of pumpkiny color
but has a little bit of a sheen and it
definitely could be used for the spring
and also summer months as well but I
think it's especially beautiful for the
fall and also this one is called 323
Rose flush and again could be used for
the spring and summer months but what I
like about it the most is that if the
bronzer in here is very cool toned and
very very subtle it doesn't look super
super crazy on the skin and then the
blush in here is also very subtle so if
you do want to go kind of crazy and
we're like really really beautiful fall
colors on your eyes and this is a great
color to put on to your cheeks so anyway
those were all 12 questions I hope you
guys enjoyed this tag like I said I

below if you were going to do this tag
