i am doing a review on the new bare
minerals California bronze multi-effect
bronzing trio it comes in this cute
little packaging but this packaging the
actual palette is adorable to really
really sleek and thin and just cute
patterns you get a nice little mirror
there you open it up and you get to
bronzers and a highlight both of the
bronzers are completely matte and the
highlight is super super shimmery as you
guys can see um these are like butter
the texture of these are amazing all of
them are just beautiful if you have ever
tried the bare minerals ready what is
that the eyeshadows the ready eight
point 0 or 2 point 0 eyeshadow format
this is what they feel like they feel
like absolute butter and they're just
just gorgeous so I'm really really happy
with this little trio so far um I
purchased mine for let's see here let me
scroll over to the Sephora page
twenty-nine dollars on these two for
websites it says it is a bronzing trio
that creates a subtle glow to a deep tan
effect it looks as though you've been
sending you around with this golden
bronson trio a sweep on a sheer wash of
warmth or a rich golden bronze over the
face for this multi-effect palette these
three universally flattering shades let
you go out every day helping looking
radiant a sun kissed glow or they can be
combined for a multi-dimensional warmth
so um the colors that you get our ocean
view which is the lighter brown shade
it's right there that's the one I have
on today I'm just wearing a really light
dusting of it on the apples of my cheeks
just to kind of get some warmth and then
you get the highlight which is called
the shining moments which I think you
guys can see it's right there it's that
gorgeous golden Sheen on my cheeks I
have a little on my nose on my cheeks
and on my chin and then you get the high
dive which is super super super dark
it's almost i want to say unwearable on
my skin tone just because i am pretty
fair but um it's still beautiful and I
really like it so I am super super
impressed with this I think the
pigmentation is gorgeous I think the
texture of all three are wonderful I
think the packaging is
horrible and sleek and just very easy
and I think for twenty nine dollars this
is a really good deal so I highly highly
recommend it I would say go check it out
on the Sephora website I know that it is
new but you absolutely get you know
three of these shades that can either be
used for I want to stay contouring
because both of the bronzers are
completely matte and then you know you
can use the shining moment for your
highlight and it really is just gorgeous
so really really happy I picked this up
um I'm just yeah I'm so so happy I can't
believe how this has kind of turned into
one of those pallets that I'm like oh my
gosh i can reach for for all over
bronzing or i can reach for for
contouring it's just really really good
so there it is again i hope you guys
enjoyed this review i highly recommend
this i will link everything below where
you can pick it up and i'll see you guys
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
