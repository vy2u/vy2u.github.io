today's video is going to be a review
and demo on the new bare minerals
complexion rescue tinted hydrating gel
cream it looks like that
I ordered mine for $29 and on the
support comm website they also have a
brush that comes with it it doesn't come
with it I'm sorry I should rephrase that
they have a brush that they want you to
buy for $28 it's supposed to be like a
smoothing face brush it looks kind of
like it's a stippling brush something
like you could get from Sigma basically
I didn't buy that just because I have so
many brushes and I thought I have to
find something that goes with this but
it turns out I actually really really
like this without a brush so basically
this is what the packaging looks like
and it says complexion rescue tinted
hydrating gel cream with broad-spectrum
broad print from broad-spectrum SPF 30 I
am in the shade opal oh one and this is
the lightest shade they have um it says
applied to clean skin with fingertips
leave four layer for additional coverage
and let me just say let's just start off
with this I don't know what I exactly I
was thinking I think I saw like an ad
for this in a magazine and it seems like
it would be kind of fuller coverage even
though it does say it tint it seemed
like it was gonna be pretty full in like
the coverage area for a tinted product
um this is not this is not at all it is
really really really like a tinted
moisturizer now there can be benefits to
that the first thing that I really like
about it is that I can apply it to just
clean skin I don't have to like it can
be one of those quick day products like
I don't have to layer on my skin care
right now I just washed my face I'm
going to show you guys what it looks
like without moisturizer without toner
on it's one of those kind of products
which is great but at the same time it
just gives such little coverage like I
wasn't at least a little more um and
it's just really runny and it just has a
very small amount of coverage so yeah
for $29 you know I think you could get a
tinted you know a tinted moisturizer
like that at the drugstore um
I'll show you guys a few that I
recommend after I apply this but anyway
let's just get started let me read for
you first I have these suppor website
pull
on the left side of my screen and I'll
greet to you guys what this product
claims to be what it is a versatile gel
cream that combines skincare benefits
and natural radiant coverage in one and
it's what it's formulated to do it is a
mineral based formulation that combines
the best of a BB and CC and a tinted
moisturizer to provide increased skin
hydration after just one week it
features SPF 30 sunscreen and it comes
in 10 shades it says this Bernt
versatile cream choose Dewey shear to
medium coverage shear they should not
say shear to medium because they can't
really be built-up super super well
shear to medium coverage to give a
radiant soft and smooth looking
appearance formulated with mineral
electrolytes to help energize skin it's
also infused with marine botanicals to
help replenish dry skin it contains
heart leaf globe Daisy
an antioxidant which aids in protecting
against environmental stressors
including and improving the appearance
of skin while keeping it hydrated so
that sounds good it says that research
results showed that a hundred percent of
the applicants experienced an
improvement in skin texture after just
one week I don't know if I've
experienced that because I have been
wearing this for about a week but um
it's good it gives my students game so
I'm gonna show you guys I'm just gonna
put my hair back and I'm going to just
apply this and set it with powder so you
guys can see exactly what it can do now
I want to tell you guys right away my
favorite thing to do with this is to
layer it underneath a foundation
especially maybe a foundation that's
really heavy duty like the Kat Von D
locket or something that's just gonna
make your skin not really look like skin
this helps to just give that extra
little moisture bits to your skin after
applying moisturizer and things like
that but today I just cleanse my skin
I've not apply toner serum moisturizer
or anything like that because I want to
show you guys how easy it is to just
quickly get your face done if you are in
a hurry in the morning so my favorite
way to apply this personally is with my
fingers um I'm glad I didn't get the
brush because I tried with like my sig
of Russia's Sigma brushes and everything
like that and it just seemed to kind of
brush away to cover it to you it's best
to just apply two fingers so I'm just
going to take this and put it onto my
hand and as you guys can see it's a very
runny
just gonna mix it together and start
applying
and it's like it's so so thin and the
coverage really is such a light coverage
and I know that they said on the you
know page that you can build it up but
honestly I find that because it is so
runny it's not really gonna build up in
the area so you wanted to it can be
moved around on the face really easily
so let me just show you guys what it can
do though because I have a little mark
right there I thought this was a pimple
and oh my goodness um actually I hit my
head the other day I was opening my
cupboard and I hit my head and that's
what it's wrong because there was a big
bruise around it yesterday and there's
no like you know there's nothing to pawn
some girls bro yes so I think it myself
so this is like a little around my eyes
because you can put this around your
eyes and since I'm not wearing any
concealer today I'll do that you know
things I think this will be really nice
in the summer time so I'm gonna let it
set cuz it looks a little oily right now
get baby white so this is just one layer
and like I said the variation err
coverage very very sheer but it does
feel good on the skin it feels really
light if you are someone who has really
really liked good skin to begin with and
you don't have a lot of like acne scars
or hyperpigmentation that you want to
cover this is going to be beautiful on
your skin really really beautiful um
hold on I have like my little tray of
stuff right here on my lap alright so
this is kind of set this is the first
layer I am gonna build up a second one
just so you guys can see
what I like is that it doesn't get um
like when you're rubbing in the seventh
layer it doesn't start flaking the first
layer sometimes when you rub like
especially with your fingers if you have
a second layer of something on your face
sometimes it can fall up this does not
do that it really feels like it it's
just going onto your skin still on to
that second that first layer so as you
can see this kind of second layer is
making me a little oily now I do have
combination skin so I already am a
little bit of an oily beast but put a
little more around my eyes but this is
the kind of coverage you're going to get
and as you can see it hasn't changed too
much but it has changed a little so
that's a good layer so at first the
first couple days I use this I didn't
like it and I was disappointed too cuz I
thought there can be more coverage but
honestly they say it on the tube it says
tinted hydrating gel cream just
basically they're saying this is a
moisturizer you liked into basically so
I'm gonna let that set goodness goodness
so let me let this set and then I'm
going to go ahead and manually set it to
with a powder
I thought I'm going to use is the earth
tone correcting powder and cool I use
this for basically all these kind of
videos just because it is my everyday
go-to and I believe that it looks good
with anything so you know I can't like
blame a review because like I used the
wrong powder or something or it didn't
look good with it so those looks good
with everything that's why I'm using
that but alright so as you can see it
has set a little more to my face now
it's oily you can see that and I like I
said I have combination skin so that's
no good I'm going to take my ELF
conferencing powder and my Ecotools
kabuki brush and I'm going to go ahead
and set this and I'm going to be pushing
it onto the skin a nice part about this
powder too is that it's going to do a
little bit of tone correcting so
that if you are wearing like a light
coverage product this will help if you
still have redness that's peeking
through I am pretty happy with the color
match though this opal shades the oh one
it doesn't seem to be too dark and even
if it is a little dark this powder kind
of lends it back up so so as you guys
can see this is nicely kind of matting
my skin netting that's fine yeah nicely
and I'm just gonna let that sit for one
second I want to show you guys what it
looks like so you can still see I have
some acne scars poking through and then
I have that guess I should call it like
a lesion of my face careful when you
open drawers guys be careful so it does
not cover huge amounts of things I did
cover my dark circles it covered the
veins on my eyelids so it covers kind of
what needs to be covered but if you are
into makeup you know that you can get
really really good coverage and then
they can cover up you know all the
little things that you want to cover up
even fat loss things like that but this
is not that kind of product and also
beer minerals is just not into that full
coverage thing they never happen they're
really about looking your best natural
stuff let's just read on the back of the
box here if they have anything different
to say about this it says treat your
skin every day with a powerhouse of skin
benefits infused with naturally radiant
color in one speck a multitasking genius
this lightweight skin quenching gel
cream smoothes on effortlessly with just
the right amount of coverage instantly
that your complexion reveals a duly
healthy looking glow so I do agree with
that it does give me a dewy looking glow
I think it would look more dewy and
pretty if you have dry skin if you've
kind of oily skin like me and it look a
little like do we but a little on the
oily side
a little on the always say so it says
Marine Band botanicals talk to you and I
already read all that stuff non chemical
broad-spectrum SPF 30 I have not had any
issues with the sunscreen in here
sometimes sunscreen really you know
makes my breakout and
Ivan had issues with that however the
smell of this
kind of smell a little bit funky and
it's probably the sunscreen in there
since we just smells like crap okay
let's be honest the only one that I have
found that doesn't is the Hawaiian
Tropic let's see here it says
lightweight shoe medium coverage shear I
say sure I don't think it's you can't
really build it up as you can see it's
nice but yeah it's a device riser
dermatologist tested hyper allergenic
clinically tested formulated without oil
silicones parabens and fragrant so if
you do have nothing skin this is nice so
as you can see it has kind of set fully
now I'm gonna apply one more product to
see if I can see like I used that elf
powder to set it but now I'm going to
apply a little bit of the NARS
translucent crystal light reflecting
setting powder and I just want to show
you guys that just wearing it alone you
still can get a really nice effect and
kind of built it into way too much kind
of just even it out even more without
layering more of the product on because
you want to save it because this was $29
so I'm just kind of putting that
everywhere and I love this translucent
crystal setting powder I have a lot of
these I that makeup for everyone I have
like the elf one but this is just really
special so anyway just used a tiny tiny
little bit of that to go all over the
face and it goes everywhere I hate that
oh those powders that are so thin a
little silicone ones it's like they go
everywhere but so this is what I would
say I would be comfortable wearing I
wear this to school a lot this past week
I've done that
and today's precedence days go school
but I wear this quite a lot I think it
color matches nicely I do like it with
just that but I can also put on the NARS
if I wanted to look even more beautiful
but it really looks like skin it looks
beautiful it's natural and yeah now I
want to show you guys a few things that
I think are kind of similar the first
thing I want to talk about they're both
from the drugstore so you guys because
this is a lot of money $29 for tinted
moisturizer
Maybelline makes this dream pure BB 81
beauty balm this one is the 2% salicylic
acid acne treatment one they have
different kinds so they have one for dry
skin they one they have one that's just
normal
and then they have this one for
salicylic with salicylic acid which is
the treatment of acne and things like
that but as you guys can see it's kind
of runny and it just blends out very
very similar to the bareMinerals one and
this one tends to dry a little more on
the math side so if you know that this
is probably going to make you really
oily this is a really good one because
it does have that salicylic acid in
there but it gives basically the same
coverage and I do like that one so you
know that's kind of like a drugstore
alternative to it's another drugstore
alternative where did it go what okay
well I guess I'll just tell you about it
it's that garden gay I'm sweating my
thumbs just educate myself as appears
just happen like what is my life like
wet okay
so I'll just tell you guys it's not
Garnier BB cream and it's you can get it
in less a year the first one is normal
combination skin I like that one I have
that one I also have the dry one and
that is the one that I think is the most
like this product because it is like for
dry skin so really really crunches your
skin it gives it alright let me just
show you this is the BB cream of Garnier
broad-spectrum SPF 50 sunscreen skin or
new miracle skin Perfector it looks like
that they have different formulations
this one is fair / light and this is
just the normal one um however they do
have one for dry skin and they have one
for combination oily which has a little
more heavy duty coverage but the dry
skin one and this one which is normal I
would say can you guys see that this is
like a really really good coverage for a
tinted moisturizer or like a beauty balm
so this one first of all smells way
better you get way more products for
life I think this is under $15 but you
get a huge amount of product and it
really does feel the same way as the
bare minerals one it's just a little
thicker it gives a little more coverage
but if you get the version for dry skin
I would say it's really really close I
was looking at the two this morning I
should've brought down instead of just
the normal one
I have all three sorry the combination
one the normal one and the dry skin one
the dry skin one is honestly too too too
much for my skin is just too hydrating
it leaves it looking too oily so I like
the normal one or even more I like the
combination oily skin ones so those
aren't two that I kind of recommend if
you want something that's gonna be
similar and you don't want to spend the
twenty eight dollars but you are looking
for light coverage and that again is the
bare minerals I like it the first couple
of days I actually thought I was gonna
return it I was like this is crap I was
like I'm gonna do a video on it I hate
it but um get it for what it is tinted
moisturizer let's get that straight it's
a tinted moisturizer just because it
says complexion rescue don't think like
oh it's gonna remove all the redness and
my acne scars and things like that no I
think what they meant by complexion
rescue is that it has sunscreen in it it
has good for your skin ingredients in it
and that's kind of a bare minerals is
about they're about also having just
makes nice skin but it looks like it's
skin not makeup and I think that's what
this does so anyway that was my little
review and demo on the bare minerals
complexion rescue tinted hydrating gel
cream with SPF 30 again my shade is opal
a1 they have I believe went to the sand
the website ten different shades so they
have a good range this really does match
me quite well so you fair-skinned girls
if you're looking for something kind of
light coverage I recommend this like I
said my favorite way to use this is to
use it underneath a really heavy to be
foundation because it does have that
moisturizing property in it and when you
wear like the Kat Von D locket or
something you need like either two
layers of moisturizer or you know layer
of moisturizer on something like this
just to make it look really really good
throughout the day so this can be worn
with without primer like today I wear it
without it doesn't look cakey it looks
smooth still you can play around with it
this is a great get-up-and-go products
like if you're late if you're running
late and yeah I hope you guys enjoyed
this and I will link every
down below where I found it and I'll see
you guys the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
