review some arm swatches and i'm going
to do some lip swatches of a bare
minerals little duo that i picked up
when i was black friday shopping this is
the bare minerals loud and clear lip
sheer duo so you get the color pink
pulse which is a nice light pink and
then you also get Barry remix which is
like a nice berry color I have them
swatched right here the first one is
Barry remix and the second one is pink
pulse so Barry remix is like a little
more obviously very colored a little
darker in color and the pink one impulse
is a little more cool I would say it's
more like a cool tone pink but um it's
really really nice it's actually my
favorite out of the two of them so love
that one anyway so um I wasn't sure
after I picked these up if I was gonna
like the formula I don't do a lot of lip
shears and if I do a lot of like lip
balm kind of things which I do I want
them to be like good color payoff and
whatnot but when I try this out I was
actually really really surprised at how
moisturizing they were but also how
glossy they were they really give a lot
of shine to the lip without the
stickiness of having a lip gloss on so I
absolutely love that and I was really
really happy about that so um I thought
I just show you guys on the lips also
what they look like I'll start with very
remixed this is what it looks like in
the tube
so this is Barry remix it's just a
really beautiful light wash of berry
color and it's super moisturizing super
glossy they smell like lemon they smell
really good I just love the high shine I
get out of it I hate to put on the other
one alright the other one is pink pulse
that's what it looks like and this is it
in the packaging beautiful color I love
this one gorgeous
so this is pink pulse so this is my
favorite one which is interesting
because normally I would go for the
berry color but love this color there's
just something about it that really goes
well with the natural color of my lips
so yeah I prefer this one but anyway
here are the swatches again on my arm
and i'm wearing pink pulse right now on
my lips and like i said i love this
little gieux oh I'm really really happy
I picked it up this was one of their
little holiday things so I know it's
still out because still the holiday
season will probably be out until after
Christmas and I highly recommend these
this was a great way to try out some of
their products and I'm pretty sure these
are full-size if they're not let me know
below and I you know once I run out of
these which will probably take a while
I'd love to pick up full size so anyway
those were the bare minerals loud and
clear lip sheer do lip sheer do oh yes a
little kid and I hope you guys enjoyed
this review and I'll see you next time
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
