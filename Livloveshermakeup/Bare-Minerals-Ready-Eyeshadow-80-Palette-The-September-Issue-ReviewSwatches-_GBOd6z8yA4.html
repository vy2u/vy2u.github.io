swatches of the bare minerals what is
this the September issue ready eyeshadow
8.0 so these are the formula the ready
eyeshadow formula which people rave
about all of the time so these are the
shades it also comes with a little brush
like this dual sided but these are the
shades and they really do live up to
their standards they're so creamy and so
easy to use and I just I really really
love them I'm here are the swatches this
is the top row you can't really see the
lighter ones it's just the lighting but
this is the top row and this is the
bottom row so i will read off the names
starting with that dark color and then
working my way this way so we have a
court or and then silhouette the purple
one is statement pret-a-porter is the
gold one place cheek is that kind of
matt nudie color uh let's see your
editors pick is that turquoise color
glitterati is that peachy color and then
ensemble is the black one so really
really beautiful i love the packaging i
think it's so sleek and easy you know
you could carry this with you and i've
been using this this week you know i
picked this up during the black friday
haul i don't know if you guys watch that
video but I hold this and I like the
formula so much that i went online and i
have an order coming in from sephora and
i got their neutral palette in the 8.0
shadow formula because i liked it that
much so here are the colors up close
like I said they're really just buttery
and creamy you know one little swipe and
you got full full color payout so um I
believe like full price this palette is
forty dollars and yes you can get
something um you know that has just a
good of pigmentation like this one right
here which I have a review coming on
which is the essence all about paradise
like you know in this palette you see
there's a few like papa
in this one you can get this for five
dollars at Ulta and get that pop of
color um but there's just something
really special about this formula and
the packaging is really really elegant
and um I don't know maybe I'm an
eyeshadow snob I'm not quite sure but um
you know I love my palettes what can I
say but yes I did pick up or I'm having
the neutral palette the 8-point Oh
neutral palette delivered to me so i
will give a review on that when it comes
in but overall i really really love this
palette love the texture i think the
texture is what makes these shadows
really stand out and the packaging so
that's my review on this i hope you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you next time fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
