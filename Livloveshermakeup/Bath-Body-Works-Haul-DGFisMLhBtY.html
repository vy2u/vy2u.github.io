thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having a fantastic day I'm a
huge box prevent body hurts here and i'm
going to show you guys what I picked up
I did some shopping on the online
website and sorry I just kicked the
camera I did some shopping on the online
website they were having all of these
like winter candles for ten dollars
apiece which usually their camels now
are like 22 dollars apiece and usually
when they're half off there like 11 so
ten dollars was really really good so I
could jump a bunch of three with candles
and then I picked up a body wash and two
of these foam bath and I'm going to
start with all of the candles because
there are eight of them so i did get
eight candles for about eighty dollars
which is quite good because these are
three lit candles and they do last quite
a while and they are starting to come up
with all of their spring staff which I'm
not really certain that I even feel
comfortable with I feel like it's way
too early and all of their winter
candles are phasing out and the last
time that i did a Bath &amp;amp; Body Works haul
I picked up a bunch of wall flowers in
deep cleansing hand soaps and three lit
candles and for some reason we got
through all the way through with candles
before our deep cleansing hand soaps and
our wall flowers so we're good on those
for now but I thought that I would just
go and pick up some more candles and
it's really fun because all of these
three wood candles I actually have never
tried before so we are just going to be
smelling them right out of the box so
let's get right into it the first two
that I picked up I usually like to have
two of the three li candles burning in
our living room at the same time so the
first two that I picked up our from well
obviously bathroom body works but these
are the holiday traditions mahogany
balsam and these are three lit candles
and I have never smelt these ones before
I literally took everything out of the
packaging but I didn't smell anything
yet so this is a mix it says walk
through holiday woods with the aromatic
fragrance of fresh green balsam juniper
berries and juniper berries and rich
mahogany oh it smells really really good
so that is what it looks like really
really cute on the front with a look
penguins but anyway it smells really
really good definitely some balls him in
there and definitely a little bit of
that mahogany if you like that mahogany
teak wood sent you would probably like
this one so I'm really really excited
about this one this one got a little bit
like beat up on the way here actually
it's so cold here the Midwest
now that's some of these candles like
the wax will freeze on the way over here
like it during like travels during the
shipping process the wax will actually
breathe and some of them come a little
broken but as long as the glass is not
broken they're still burnable and I
still put them I put them in Campbell
sleeve so it's not like you can see the
broken wax anyway but yes alright the
next one I picked up is the white bar
enjoy peppermint marshmallow scented
candle this is let's see here it says
indulge in the fragrance of fluffy
vanilla marshmallows which are full of
holiday sweetness and peppermint joy so
this is what it looks like oh this one
smells really good definitely you get
that a little bit of vanilla but
definitely the peppermint Undertown I
really really like peppermint but there
was a candle that i'll probably be
showing in my empties video be what was
it um peppermint cheer or something like
that one of their three-week handles
that i liked last year and this year i
did not it had a combination of
peppermint and vanilla as well and it
gave me a huge headache but this one
smells really really good and i think it
will warm up nicely like once you burn
it sometimes these candles smell a
little different once you start burning
them they kind of warm up a little bit
so i'm excited to try it that one let's
see here the next one I got is the white
bar noel silver pine and cedar smell is
ooh ooh that's a very great very strong
like pine scent not quite sure I love
that one it kind of smells like an air
freshener in a car it's very very strong
it says create a beautiful home for
Christmas that's probably why I was on
sale st. Christmas candle but it says
create a beautiful home for Christmas
with this aromatic blend of pine needles
cedar and juniper springs sprigs sorry
yeah I definitely felt a lot of pine in
here so very very woodsy scent if you
don't like would see sense then I would
stay away from that one is definitely
smells very frequency to me alright
let's see here the next one I got is
winter and this is one that like last
year I remember smelling in store and I
wasn't that interested in it yeah
there's something about this candle this
is like one of their best selling ones
too like during the winter or season my
favorite during the winter season is the
taste of season but I really wanted to
try all new ones this time
specially because they were on sale it
smells really good I'm going to burn
this one in the beauty room because it
is white and I can do a little really
really nice in here but it just doesn't
smell like a bath and Bodyworks
candlewick it kind of smells it's a
little more sophisticated spelling and
there's absolutely nothing wrong with
that whatsoever I'm just one of those
people I really do like kind of sweet
sense so I was never huge on this one
but I said you know why don't I get it
and maybe it will kind of warm up once
you start burning it so it says a
fragrance that captures the moment when
glittering icicles and sparkling snow
transform the landscape it is a mix of
pine needles IC Mandarin and winter
woods and who'd you get that little bit
of sweetness from the Mandarin but it's
an interesting scent I'll leave it at
that I think it's interesting I'll keep
you guys updated on that I'm sure you
will see it in my empties video and I'll
let you know if I liked it but when i
smell it cold I'm not like super super
into the same alright the next to I got
are also going to be burnt in our living
room I like to have two of them going in
there this is the Alpine cheer bath and
body works three wood candle oh my gosh
this one smells amazing oh my gosh okay
so that's what it looks like it's got
the little mittens and then the cute
little lid oh my gosh it smells so good
it says add cheer to your winter with
the Chris fragrance of mountain balsam
cedar wood bark and snow white cranberry
oh this smells so good I kind of bummed
that I didn't get more of these oh wow
it smells really really good you
definitely get that little bit of
cranberry hair is that what they said
yeah cranberry oh yes the other candles
like this to have a little bit of
sweetness um the winter one is nice it
just doesn't have a lot of sweetness the
Mandarin doesn't give that much of a
sweetness but this smells really really
good oh my gosh I think this is my
favorite one that I got so far and then
the last one that I picked up is
snowflakes and spruce and it looks like
this this one's really nice too oh my
gosh yeah ok so I would say that my
favorites are the Alpine cheer and this
one snowflakes and spruce this one's
nice too it's a little more subtle
definitely vanilla in here let's see
what is the blend it says kick off the
holiday party season with an outdoorsy
blend inspired by snow cat spruce and
sweetened by a touch of creamy vanilla
yeah I definitely smell the vanilla in
there this one smells really really good
but I
to say that alpine gr1 oh my gosh it
smells so good one of them got a little
beat up again like the UM not beat up
but it froze through the actual oh my
gosh it's like a nose gasm sorry but it
smells so good um like the West got a
little like broken up because it froze
but again I put them in three week
handles Lacey won't be able to tell
alright so those are the Campbells I
picked up I'm really really excited for
these snowflakes and spruce one and
definitely the Alpine tier i will
probably be burning those immediately in
the living room after this video but
then i did go ahead and pick up some
more up the body wash and foam bath so
the first one I got is from the
aromatherapy line I love this line from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works this is a sleep on
this is warm milk and honey body wash
and foam bath and I use these mostly for
bubble baths but you can use them at
body washes as well it says good night
cinnamon essential oil is warm and
comforting while Club essential oil
soothes for restful sleep and that's
what it looks like and this was really
really cheap I think this was like five
dollars whose smells really really nice
and good and warm milk and honey like
that just sounded so tempting and you do
get 10 fluid ounces in here so that is
the first 1i purchase and then I
purchase another one from the
aromatherapy line I have never come
across the scent and I have actually
never come across the scent as well so
these were new I think this year they
warm milk and honey and then this one is
cedar wood in sage I've never gotten my
hands on this one as well it is another
body washing foam bath and it's as
soothe your senses cedarwood essential
oil calms the senses and sage essential
oil helps bring clarity and I love these
oh this one smells really nice now get
my nose in there definitely a lot of
stage in this one I like the smell of
sage some people don't but um that it's
really really nice and I'm super excited
to use those for bubble baths and
occasional party washes and then the
last thing I picked up it was this bad
why works aromatherapy sleep body wash
this is the detoxify while you dream
body wash it looks like this a cool it's
not awesome it says this limited edition
formula is infused with bamboo charcoal
extract to help detoxify before sleep
and can
essential oil to enhance sleep so it's
black chamomile and his I thought it was
really cool died had charcoal in here
and I'm gonna keep this in our master
bathroom and meet me my boyfriend leaves
this once in a while it looks very manly
doesn't it I just thought like the
charcoal in there look kind of cool so
maybe he'll use it um but yeah it says
breathe deeply for best results and it
says this renewing body wash contains
bamboo charcoal extract so I thought
that was really really cool let's take a
whiff of it it smells really good just
like um chem Amell so that's all I
really smells like it's chamomile but I
thought it looked really really cool and
I'm excited that has trouble in there so
anyway that is on my Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
haul I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and give it a thumbs up if you did and I
will see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
