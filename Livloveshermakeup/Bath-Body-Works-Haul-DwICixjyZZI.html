the title of this video this is going to
be a back and Body Works haul Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works has been having some like
kick-ass sales going on the past week
they've been having sales on their three
with candles like 24 21 or like $11
peace whatever and then um there what
are these deep cleansing hand soaps
these were like six for 20 or something
they had five for five dollar hand
sanitizers like little mini ones their
pocket backs and then they even had a
half off their whole aromatherapy line
and if you know about the body works you
know that their aromatherapy line is
normally like sixteen dollars for a top
of scrub or like a luxury bathroom stuff
like that so everything was like eight
dollars with me things so anyway I
purchased a lot of stuff and I'm going
to share it with you guys so let's get
started the first thing I got were some
deep cleansing hand soaps I use these
all the time this is my favorite um
virgin that they have I know they have
like foaming moisturizing I like the
deep cleansing ones I use to in my
kitchen at the same time and also one in
my bathroom so the first one I got was
Maui mango mai tai and it says to the
crystal blue waves of tropical Maui to
the golden sand beaches of otaku
experience Hawaii like never before
let's smell it smells really really good
as smells like a coconut and just like
deliciousness just I love it so that is
a Maui mango mango might I the next one
I got was Island white pineapple and all
of these are already like broken up
because I did smell them this one smells
really good too it just smells like I
don't know a pineapple drink like super
yummy next I got this one which is
amazon rainforest orchid and this smells
amazing it's like a really beautiful
almost like kind of perfume e floral
scent i really like that i'm going to
use that in my bathroom i also got
papaya sunset I just not this one again
i forgot oh yeah it smells really good
really strong there's like papaya and
maybe a little bit of grapefruit so that
one looks like and then i also picked
that peach bellini which is just an like
oldie but a goodie favorite for me I
love the way this smells it's really
springy and just bubbly it smells like a
bubbly like peach drink
that is that one and then I got some
three with candles the first one I got
to with apple flower this is a new set
this year it smells so good you guys it
smells like an apple and floral is just
a great combination let me read for the
pack what it says you guys it says a
pretty springtime blend of sock soft
soft soft big apple blossoms crimp app
crisp apple slices and green citrus
leaves and that's exactly what it smells
like pink apple blossoms in crisp apple
slices oh it's so good so it's that
perfect like springtime scent and i love
these three what candles they burn
really evenly and they last forever like
so like those a lot and then i got three
of you lilac blossom this is a
reoccurring favorite up line when it
comes to the candles it just smells
exactly like lilacs so i think i love it
it's great great time um it says freshly
cut lilac blossom with a hint of lily of
the valley and delicate violet create
the ultimate spring fragrance it's so
good so i got three of those because i
love them so much and then oh my god i'm
running out of space already to put
these things um and then i got let's see
here five of these little packet back
hand sanitizers they were 5 45 so i got
pink peonies and paris i got wild mango
mojito i love how all the stuff this
spring is named after like drinks and
this one is hawaiian pink hibiscus i
also got papaya sunset and jungle
passion fruit and they all smell really
good i already opened and much and took
a whiff and i'm going to show you all
the stuff that i got from the
aromatherapy line like I told you guys
um everything was half off which is
awesome because i really loved their
bath products from this line and they
usually cost like sixteen dollars and i
don't like to pick them up when they're
that expensive so the first thing i got
was the sleep a lavender chamomile
luxury bath and this was again eight
dollars and you pour this into your bath
and it just creates like this wonderful
experience it smells really good it's
really creamy really luxurious it's got
like vitamins and good you know
essential oils
help like sue with you it says lavender
and chamomile essential oils soothe and
calm to enhance sleep so I like to take
baths and put this in there at nighttime
the next one I got to give them on my
lap was the lavender vanilla luxury bath
so this is the same exact thing as this
one except it's a different fragrance so
this is the lavender chamomile and this
is lavender vanilla it smells really
good i just have more of a vanilla scent
then I got the stress relief eucalyptus
spearmint back soak and these are like
these little crumbles we look like a
little pieces of rock or something that
you put into your back you put like a
couple capsules in and it just really
relaxes your body anything with like the
eucalyptus spearmint fragrance and
they're really just calms me down makes
me feel really good um I find it
actually more calming than liked the
lavender one for whatever reason so the
eucalyptus spearmint it's just really
like clears my mind the scent is great
and it says eucalyptus essential oil
clears the mind while spearmint
essential oil up lips so it feels really
good and I like these little bath soaps
they're really fun they do melt
eventually but they don't like cause
they don't make any buckets or anything
these don't either yep to get bubble
back for that which is why I got this
this is the stress relief eucalyptus
tangerine which i think sounds amazing
body wash in foam bath i'm gonna use
this as a foam bath um you know bubble
bath basically and it says focus your
energy eucalyptus and citrus essential
oil help clear your mind to support
focus so i thought that sent just
sounded amazing eucalyptus cantering so
really excited for that and then i
decided to get a pillow mist i used to
have the lavender vanilla one and
actually it just didn't relax me the way
that the eucalyptus spearmint sanch does
so i thought this would be really nice
you just spray this on to your pillow at
night and I didn't remember having any
kind of like reaction or breakouts when
I use the lavender vanilla one so I'm
sure I won't be sensitive to this one
but this is the eucalyptus spearmint
pillow mist and it says eucalyptus
essential oil clears the mind while
spearmint essential oil uplifts and it
says use the stress relieving pillow
miss to clear your mind of relax spray a
lightness over
or sheets for an authentic aromatherapy
experience allow fabric to da to dry
prior to contact so I think that would
be nice I didn't think about it looks
great on your sheets too so hopefully
that will help me sleep I have sleeping
issues I've told you guys that before um
next I got me some nice that these are
nice glass bottles on the energy orange
ginger body miss this is an amazing sent
from the aromatherapy line if you
haven't smelled this orange ginger
fragrance you really should it's really
uplifting smells amazing so this is the
body mist and it says boost your energy
orange and ginger essential oils are
uplifting to release tension and sharpen
the senses and I feel like it does that
when i use it the first time I used this
was actually at my boyfriend's he had
the soap and it just smelt so good when
I was washing my hand it was just like
yeah I feel great so um I'm really
excited to have this as a body mist you
guys know I love me just watch me body
mess uh and then I picked up the
aromatherapy stress relief eucalyptus
basil sugar scrub so I love me some
sugar scrubs or salt scrubs anything
that's exfoliating for the body last
year I picked up probably 12 of these
not this particular scent I got like one
of every single cent out of the
aromatherapy line but again it's
originally sixteen dollars and it was on
sale for eight so it looks such a great
deal but however I did find I didn't
love the formula it left me a little
greasy a little oily but i thought when
i saw this one this year eucalyptus
basil i love love the scent of basil so
i knew i had to pick this up so i got
that one and when I said I didn't like
the formula I just meant the oiliness
that it left after like you can use a
body wash to kind of like get that
oiliness off but I tend to be you know
more combination kind of skin like as
you can see right now I'm oily so um I
just don't like the feeling of being
super super oily but the formula is
still great like it's super super
exfoliating leaves your skin beautifully
like just beautifully touchable next
I've act me stress relief eucalyptus tea
luxury bath so again it's that luxury
bath that really nice like shiny pretty
formula and this is the eucalyptus tea
so I just wanted to pick up a few of
these because i love bath products i
especially love these on luxury bath so
i thought i'd pick up the eucalyptus t12
this one is a little more like a sharper
sent it's not as like relaxing but it
smells real good then i picked up of
course the eucalyptus spearmint luxury
bath I'm sure you guys can see that i
love these lives through that i really
really love them but um I just wanted to
pick up one of each sent and I know this
one will probably be my favorite cuz i
love that eucalyptus spearmint site um
let's see here and the last thing are we
done oh my god yes we're done okay the
last thing i got worthy lavender vanilla
frap so so again like those little rock
pieces like rock candy or something I
don't know like rock candy scraped into
a jar but um this is just the lavender
vanilla scent and again these are
originally 16 so when you can pick them
up for eight dollars like I feel like
that's such a good deal I'm the reason I
really stock up like this is because
this will last me and tell be next time
they have fifty percent off i believe on
your aromatherapy line they only do
fifty percent off twice a year so next
time I think it's during the fall
they'll happen and i will stop rub again
so anyway that was my Bath and Body
Works haul I hope you guys enjoyed this
and i'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
