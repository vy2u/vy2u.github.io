purchased handles so hair care body
cared all that kind of stuff so i'm
going to show you guys what I got they
have recently launched um like the full
you know sends and things like that at
the back and Body Works stores and I'm
so excited because you guys will see
when I fill my empties in a few days I
have used up all of my summer scents all
of my summer sense when it comes to life
you know deep cleansing hand so any kind
of soaps um candles I've used all of
those up so I was so excited that these
boxes came in the mail because I've been
waiting and I am ready to start burning
yummy-smelling fall candles starting
September first and also just you know
putting in new soaps and just having all
these yummy smelling fall items Oh a
little strength yummy smelling fall
items to have starting September first
this is like a first for me literally um
because normally i do not get through
like all my summer sense until like the
middle of September's so i'm so excited
false starts in with four days well
technically it doesn't I know it doesn't
start for a while but I feel like
September's when it starts to get cooler
and it already is quite cool where I am
here in Wisconsin so I'm so excited I'm
very excited for fall and yeah i'm going
to show you guys what I got so I'm going
to start with the box they have candles
in them I love three lit candles from
Bath and Body Works so let me show you
which ones I got the first one I got it
I just want to say look at the new lids
aren't those cute the new lids have
these cute little leads on them i think
it's so beautiful so the first one I got
was sweater weather this is one that I
get every single year it smells very
very fresh and very like outdoorsy kind
of woodsy and it says that it is an
invigorating blend of eucalyptus juniper
berry and fresh sage and it yeah fresh
sage in the fall air so it smells really
really good very very fresh you can
smell all of those you know stage and
eucalyptus in there
just really really nice scent I love it
the next one I picked up with leaves i
had to get leaves because i get it every
year it is just like a cult favorite it
smells amazing again that love the lid
and this is a blend of let's see here
says celebrate the brilliant colors of
autumn with this rich blend of golden
nectar red apple and spiced berries and
if you have never smelled leaves you are
missing out because it is like oh it's
the perfect perfect fall set so picked
up leaves candle the next one I picked
up with another kind of fresher one like
the sweater weather it is autumn this is
one of my favorite favorites I love this
just as much as leaves and you know the
other two that I just showed you but
this is autumn and it says a festival of
colors is about to start with the coming
season celebrate with the fragrance of
bright red apple cedar wood and notes of
fur balsam oh my gosh it's so fresh I
just love the set I think it's one of
those that like really kind of gets you
into the fall spirit without being like
heavy like really really bakery kind of
smelling goods this is like the other
this is you're the person that doesn't
like those like really really sweet
smelling fall candles it's very very
like woodsy and kind of just feels like
a fresh outdoor walk I don't know do you
know what I mean like you pick up a lot
of like woodsy sense with this one
really really love it very very fresh
smelling i would say that in the leaf
scandal are very very nice for someone
who doesn't like the really sweet stat
if you do like the really sweet scents
this one pumpkin pie is also really nice
they have little pumpkins on this lid
cute but i do for this new lid so pretty
but anyway this is pumpkin pie i
actually have never met this one so
usually what I do is I like to get my
favorite campbell's like when fall
starts I always get leaves i always get
sweater weather autumn just the ones
that i get every single year and that i
love but i like to also pick up a like
one or two for this occasion I only
picked up one but I'm one that I haven't
tried yet so this one is pumpkin pie and
it says save room for this delicious
autumn blend of creamy pumpkin whipped
vanilla and flaky pie crust that's a
sweet
your favorite pumpkin pie and it's so
good it smells just like you know it
smells a lot like the pumpkin cupcake
one any kind of those really really
sweet kind of bakery sent ones it smells
like that super super yummy love that so
that is what I've got in that little box
those were my candles now we are going
to move on to soaps and like body care
things like that hair care sorry if I
keep moving this around I got this in my
little Melissa Autry subscription box
yesterday or subscription bag and I
actually think it's really really cute
yeah anyway so um understand you guys
the deep cleansing hands hopes that i
picked up because i love these so the
person one I got was sweet cinnamon
pumpkin uh this is just one of those
like cult favorites again from Bath and
Body Works it just smells very very
fresh and punking me I guess you could
say it's got a little bit of cinnamon it
says it has pumpkin cinnamon and spiced
sugar in it so that is the deep
cleansing hand soap would probably have
that in the kitchen at the sink and then
I got sunlight and apple trees this is
one that I believe is new this year I've
not tried it and it smells very very
fresh it's just it's lovely smells just
very very fresh like apples and it's
it's great it says it has fresh apple
Kintz qu I nce and birch would really
really like that one very fresh gonna
put that again in the kitchen sink area
this one's going to be in our bathroom
for like our main we're moving hence all
the boxes so um this is going to be in
our new bathroom like the master
bathroom I guess you could say and this
is the pumpkin pecan waffles deep
cleansing hand soap and this is fluffy
waffles sugared pecans and maple syrup
um not so fresh smelling it's definitely
more of the baked goods kind of scent
but it's lovely it smells amazing so I'm
going to have that in the master
bathroom and then I think this one will
be in the guest bathroom this is the
crisp morning air of the smell so good
this is a new one to meet this year it's
like probably one of my favorites it
just smells so clean and fresh and I
says it has pine juniper and a hint of
pear
so that is the crisp morning air deep
cleansing n so moving on I picked up two
of the aromatherapy uh soaps because
these were on sale I got the stress
relief eucalyptus spearmint one my
boyfriend really likes these ones so i
picked up the eucalyptus spearmint and
also the orange ginger the orange ginger
is a great scent I also for myself
picked up the stress relief eucalyptus
spearmint body mist um I love the way
these are packaged just comes in a
beautiful glass bottle so it's not
plastic it's glass it's really gorgeous
I think it's beautiful you know sitting
on the you know the area that you put
your perfume I love it so it's a very
stress relieving sent I don't know I
just feel like this would really like
common ians IV I have at the end of the
day I tend to get a little bit of
anxiety before i go to bed at night I
tend to get a little bit of insomnia
from anxiety so I thought that this
would be a really really nice thing to
have just kind of you know spray on me
just feel good and relaxed I guess it
could be for any time but originally
this is like fifteen dollars and it was
on sale for half off somes around eight
so anyway um really really like that and
moving on I picked up one of the pocket
backs um I this year did really good i
normally get like the bundle where you
get like five of them however i did not
do it this year because i literally just
got through the last one that i had in
my bundle from last year and they were
all in false sense so i had to use a
false end all through summer all through
spring it was not fun so i just picked
up one this time they do have new
packaging it's really cute it's very
like small and round there like this a
lot um this is the pocket back in
pumpkin cupcake one of my favorite very
very sweet smelling and then I picked up
some body here I had never tried v co
bigelow this is like one of the brands
that they sell through the website and
this is the number 1 for 11 meant the
body vitamin body wash with peppermint
oil one point nine percent it says are
vitamin rich formula deeply cleanses
with an invigorating sensation I thought
this would be lovely just for the fall
um I really really like like
invigorating face washes and body washes
that
kind of make you feel really really
fresh especially during the fall so it
says our wake up formula deeply
nourishes with vitamins a c and e to
keep skin extra healthy and looking its
best so I'm really really excited to try
it out it smells amazing very very
strongly of peppermint and then I picked
up from the true blue spa line which
again is another brand that they sell
through the online website this is the
shea cashmere hair conditioner um I
picked this up because I really love the
shade cashmere sent because I tried one
of the little mini hand creams last year
and loved it so I thought I would pick
up a conditioner and try it out i have
not tried any kind of conditioners or
anything from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works so we'll
see how that goes and then I also picked
up a bigger size of the shea cashmere
hand cream because I loved that so much
so anyway that if everything that i got
from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works candles hand
soaps you know some body stuff and I
also got these two little twenty percent
off coupons so um yeah so that is great
that will be for my next purchase I hope
you guys enjoyed this Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
haul if you did please give this video
thumbs up and I'll see you my next one
