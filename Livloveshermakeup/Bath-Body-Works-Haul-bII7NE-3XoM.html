makeup list messy hair I have a hair
mask in right now and I'm going to put a
face mask on after this so this is now
thursday afternoon when I'm filming this
I've been barefaced all day and I've a
show tonight so I'm kind of prepping for
that and just laying my skin breathe
before I piled tons of makeup on it
anyway I hope you guys don't mind I know
that I have been barefaced on camera
quite a bit this week anyway in this
video i wanted to share a bath and
Bodyworks haul with you guys and i am
posting another video tomorrow so I'm
filming this on Thursday this will be up
friday and the reason i want to get it
up or at least film it is because i
really want to dig into these products
because we are out of hand soap and like
burnt through all our candles so anyway
that is why i'm kind of filming this and
i am not going to combine the two videos
I have my lip balm collection plus many
reviews video going up at 6am and then
this will probably be up around five or
six I didn't want to combine the two
because they just felt like they were
complete opposites like a halt and then
a collection video it was just kind of
weird so anyway we have two separate
videos today but let's go ahead and just
get right into it shall we alright so
I'm going to start with the three wick
candles because those are my favorite of
course so we got some three McCandles
deep cleansing hand soaps aromatherapy
hand soaps and then of course some
wallflowers so the first three what
candle I picked up was the what is this
called rainforest gardenia and I'm going
to burn this in the beauty room I really
like to burn white candles in here with
like a little bit of pop of color
because they feel like it goes nicely
with my background and it says the
alluring floral scent of a beautiful
island gardenia blended with fresh
bamboo in a sweet apple water inspires a
tropical luxury and I really can smell
like the fresh bamboo sent in there and
also a little bit of gardenia it's not
too overpowering gardenia can sometimes
be a little overpowering but it's really
really nice and mellow and I feel like
I'm going to like that one a lot the
next one I picked up it was the mahogany
coconut I believe this is new this year
and I really wanted to try it out i love
mahogany teak wood and I do like coconut
sense as long as they're not too musky
so this smells really really good we're
going to have this in at the bedroom
just because it is kinda
unisex sort of scent and it says a
sophisticated blend of where mahogany
and creamy coconut milk layered over
soft sandalwood and I like it it's very
very subtle and I don't think it will
irritate Tong because he is kind of
sensitive to fragrance right the next
one we got is the Tiki bingo a mai tai
it looks like this I love this look at
that bright candle it says drink in a
tropical blend of mango nectar jasmine
flower and Sunkist grapefruit now who
wants to hula it really smells good this
actually kind of like I feel like this
smells like guava I don't know why maybe
it's the grapefruit in there tricking me
but it just smells like guava to me and
I love anything like fruity like that so
yes I am sure that I will love this and
this will be burned in the MLS games day
master bathroom no the guest bathroom
because that's where I take all my
bubble bath and I like having a sweet
candle burning while I take my bath all
right and then they last 2-3 wick
candles I picked up or we picked up a
worthy Waikiki Beach coconut three wick
candles I'm not a huge fan of these I
did smell them right away and I don't
really like the packaging either it's
just super bright green almost like
fluorescent and we're gonna have these
in the living room and I just don't
really think the scent is that fantastic
it just smells like two musky like
coconut with sandalwood it says it is a
blend of let's see here fresh coconut
saltwater braces and sun bleached woods
and somebody said on the bath and
Bodyworks a website that this smelled
identical to Tiki Beach I do not agree
whatsoever Tiki Beach have a little more
oomph to it it's got some like flora Lee
and fruity sort of undertones this is
just straight-up coconut and sandalwood
so I hope that I'll be okay with burning
these I really hate coconut and lime
together if it's mixed with like a musty
scent that really drives me crazy but I
think these will be okay they're mostly
just coconut with like a little bit of
sandalwood but yeah they smell very very
musky so anyway I probably wouldn't
repurchase though is hopefully they'll
smell better once we start burning them
and let's see here we got two little
sets of the wallflowers we like to get
the little duo so we have the vanilla
coconut so this is a repurchase actually
we're using up the other vanilla coconut
ones right now and this is just really
nice to have in the
very like soft neutral sort of scent and
then beautiful day this is what I like
to have in the beauty room its a mix of
like Fuji apples and I think peonies and
I do have it right now in the beauty
room I'm finishing up my two little ball
flowers but it smelled so good so I
wanted to get this again because I love
walking into the beauty room of just
having that freshness of Awesome all
right let's get into the hand soap so we
picked up two for Tom these are the bath
and body works aromatherapy stress
relief and energy hand soaps this is the
orange ginger one and this one is the
eucalyptus spearmint so he likes those a
lot we picked those up and then if you
guys didn't know Bath &amp;amp; Body Works is
bringing back some of their old
fragrances like their top 10 fragrances
like sweet pea and cucumber melon and
plumeria and things like that for the
summertime so they deep cleansing hand
soaps that I picked up I actually wanted
to go ahead and get like old signature
fragrances because it brings me back so
the first one I got is coconut lime
verbena and now I know I just said I
hate coconut and lime together but
there's definitely some like lemon and a
little bit of zest in here that kind of
balances out the scent if that makes
sense it's not too musky so I did pick
this up and I remember using this when I
was like a kid it says it is an island
blend of cesti lime lemon verbena and
coconut water so it's really not
overpowering at all and I like the
coconut and lime in here I think it's
because it mostly smells like lime and
lemon alright the next 10 and that one's
going to be in the kitchen by the way
the next one we got it was the bath and
body works Sweet Pea deep cleansing hand
soap I should say the next one I got
because I buy all of these because they
smell so good and Tom's like it can't be
bothered to 50 but anyway this is the
Sweet Pea deep cleansing hand soap it
says sweet pea petals shira freesia and
luscious raspberry and if you never have
smelled this you really should it's just
one of those like old-school sense it
just smells so fresh and nice so I plan
on having this in the guest bathroom
because sometimes I do my makeup in
there and I use the hand soap in there a
lot so I feel like I'll get a lot of
used on pad line alright the next one I
picked up with cucumber melon we're
gonna have this in the kitchen as well
this is just one of those like timeless
sense it's so nice it's like a very very
fresh smelling and it says it isn't
uplifting combination of Chris cucumber
and fresh honeydew and it just smells
amazing i love this and then the last
one that i picked up it was sun-ripened
raspberry which is like so old school i
loved this scent so much i just smells
like raspberries so so so good and we're
gonna have this again in the kitchen it
says sun-ripened raspberry strawberry
leaves and sugar crystals so those are
all of the deep cleansing hand soaps we
picked up so anyway and that is my
little haul or our little haul I hope
you guys enjoyed this Bath and Body
Works haul thank you for joining me and
I shall see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
