you so much for joining me today's video
is going to the eight Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
haul I'm sorry I just realized I'm
zoomed in kind of far okay whatever
today's video going to be a Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works haul I picked up some three with
candles we picked up some deep cleansing
hand soaps and well flowers and
absolutely sent portable so I'm going to
share with you guys what we got the
first two items that we got to person
through with candles so I'll share those
first we got island margarita and we got
two of these because I like to have two
of these burning at the same time in our
living room so island margarita is one
of my all-time favorite scents from bath
and body works especially during the
summertime is probably my go-to favorite
scent it's a beautiful beautiful blend
of let's see here mandarin sweet mango
and plum with a freshly salted rim and
it just smells so good and lately I have
noticed that these three wick candles
are really burning even more evenly
which is awesome but even more evenly
but seriously sometimes they don't burn
super evenly and that always makes me
really angry because you know you can
get more out of them if they burn more
like evenly so anyway they have been
doing that lately which is great these
third one that we got to let's see here
is called blueberry twist I have never
tried this one before right now about
the body works they have all of their
false scents out but I'm not ready for
that yet it's way too early I cannot do
the fall set thing yet so we picked up
just a few more summer candles this is
blueberry twist and it is a blend of
whipped vanilla coconut and also
blueberries so oh it smells really
really good if you are someone who is a
fan of really really sweet sense like
you like the kind of like the baked
goods kind of sense you would like that
one and then for the bedroom we got
sparkling waves and this one is a blend
of cool citrus water meet water eat in
modest can't speak watery bergamot and
must that captures the moment when
sunlight sparkles like diamonds on the
water so it smells really really good we
try and get something like a little more
unisex for our bedroom so that is what
it looks like and I love those little
lids and then the final candle that I
got is for the beauty room it is suntan
and I have never smelled this one before
either but it's really cute it's white
and then it has a little embossed
pattern there that is gold and it smells
exactly like sunscreen and
people may think that that smells really
gross I actually like the scent of like
good sunscreen so it says bask in these
sunny fragrance of vibrant orange
blossoms bright citrus and soft coconut
musk so that is the third one or I'm
sorry the fifth one yeah that does the
fifth damn but we got all right moving
on we got some deep cleansing hand soaps
you guys know Tom and I love the deep
cleansing hand so formulation now they
will be taking these off the market in
2017 because they're going to begin
getting rid of those little beads
because it's just not good for the
environment they're gonna have ones that
are like Cahawba and stuff like that
instead so anyway um I won't get into
that but right now we're still going to
be purchasing these and tell we can't
anymore I guess or maybe next time I
shop about the body works i'll get the
foaming hand soaps but this one is crisp
morning air and we got four hand soaps
that are for the fall and then three for
the summer to kind of finish this off
and tell September so this one is a
blend of soft pine fresh juniper and
juicy pear and we had this last year it
smelled amazing this is like one of my
favorites Oh deep cleansing hand soap
sent during the fall time it just smells
so good if you really like those fresh
kind of fall sense you would love that
one we also got summer sale which is a
blend of salty air pink peppercorn and
blonde woods anytime Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
has something called blonde woods it
seems to smell really good I seem to
like that so I don't even know what
blonde woods is but it smells damn good
so anyway that one smells really nice as
well it kind of smells like old spice
which I really like and then we also got
beach house which looks like this it's
kind of like turquoise waters but
turquoise waters has that more like
distinct scent this one is a blend of
fresh Island palm pink jasmine and
beechwood so yeah it smells really good
it smells kind of like lemon and a
little more citrusy which I personally
do like you guys know I love citrusy
stance especially orange and lemon so I
like that one we also got a honeycrisp
apple which is a blend of juicy apple
fresh sage and mulled spice I'm guessing
that this smells very similar to farm
stand apple with a little bit of sage
yeah smells so so so good and that's
obviously a false scent so we're excited
to have that one
we also went ahead and got sparkling
seas which is a blend of water lily
morning dew and coral mosque and this
one smells very very similar actually
this one kind of smells like turquoise
waters yeah I would say this one smells
more like turquoise waters than the
other one this is what it looks like I
know turquoise waters was a really
really popular sent this summer so
that's why I'm comparing it to that we
also got fall lakeside breeze which is a
blend of blue sage sweet basil and
sandalwood and we got this last year I
remember Tom liking this one I didn't
love this one I definitely prefer the
lakeside are not all excited this is
lakeside breeze I definitely preferred
the crisp morning air scent but this one
smells pretty good you definitely can
smell the basil it kind of reminds me of
that mrs. meyer's basil hand stuff which
I really like my mom has that in the
house in Minneapolis so I do like the
scent of that we also have golden autumn
day which is a blend of sunny vandron
autumn leaves and again blonde wood so
this is a new scent for the fall its
take a whiff yeah this fall's really
citrusy with like a little bit of
moscone and I really really like that
scent and then we also got some
wallflowers you guys know I love The
Wallflowers now this time we did
something a little different we got the
odor-eliminating wallflowers now I
normally just get the regular
wallflowers because like our apartment
smells good we don't need outer
eliminating um but what I notice that
the wealth ours is that like halfway
through the bulb I just don't smell
anything anymore in the apartment and I
have a very strong like sense of
fragrance I don't know why I can take
like a lot of fragrance and for some
reason it just doesn't like do it for me
like I feel like I smell it for the
first half and then once it's halfway
through I just don't smell them anymore
so I wanted to see if the
odor-eliminating versions had a little
more of a stronger scent throw so we got
fresh cotton and I have those plugged in
right now in the beauty room and then we
also got lavender and vanilla and we had
these plugged in right now in the living
room so beautiful living room and then
they last two items that I got are like
a scent portable thing I don't know if
you guys have heard about these but Bath
&amp;amp; Body Works has these cute little clip
bonds that you clip onto the vent inside
of your car and it basically releases
sense into your car so i could never
tried these before so the little clip
that I got is a little baby owl they had
so many onions a baby owl with a mama
how old it's
super super cute and it's gold and
sparkly they had so many cute ones for
the fall but I thought this one could
take me throughout the whole year and
then these actual sent portable
fragrance refill that I got to use
watermelon lemonade so that's gonna be
the first one that I start out with I
have no idea how to like even do this
but I'm gonna try it out in my car and
I'll let you guys know so anyways that
is my bath and body works he'll like
hope you guys enjoyed as this video
