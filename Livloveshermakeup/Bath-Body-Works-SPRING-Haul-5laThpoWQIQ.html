video is going to be a spring bath and
body works all this box is so dirty and
disgusting i already emptied everything
out so that i can just reach for it and
not have to dig in the gross grimy box
but anyway this is going to be like I
said a spring back body where's how
everything that you're going to see is
spring the fragrance honestly bad body
work starts to release their spring
fragrances a little too early for me
that's my tank Tom not my bra strap they
started releasing a little too early
like literally the beginning of februari
they started releasing these ends and I
was like I can't hang with it I'm not
ready I am NOT ready for the spring
sense yet so anyway I did end up picking
some up at the beginning of March and
i'm here to share with you guys what I
got I have not started burning any of
the camels yet or using anything yet the
only thing that I did start using was I
picked up a little double set of the
wallflowers like a little duel set and
those are the lab interracial ones and
we have those in the living room right
now and then I haven't opened anything
else so we have three lit candles we
have soaps and then we have wallflowers
so let's just get right into it I'm
going to start with the three McCandles
because those are my favorite so the
first two that I picked up are the
blueberries and cream three wick candles
and I like to have two of these burning
in our living room / dining room /
kitchen at once just because it really
makes like the scent pool like very very
strong and I really really like that so
yeah the blueberries in cream scent is
described as sweet vanilla cream garden
blueberries and a hint of sugar they
really smell amazing just very very
creamy like vanilla and blueberries
mixed together and I have a feeling that
these are going to smell even better
once they are kind of heated up like
with a wax pool if that makes sense so
once you start to burn them they're
gonna smell even better I find that when
you start to burn candles they have like
a vanilla scent to them they really
start to open up and smell even more
like born once you start burning them so
I'm really excited about those those
will be for the living room and then I
picked up another two for the living
room and these are the fresh-cut lilac
tree with candles I love these I get
these every single year they've been
changing the name but it's the same
formulation it just smells like
straight-up lilacs
you love the smell of lilacs which I
don't know why you wouldn't it smell
amazing oh my god you would love these
they just smells so darn good just like
literally fresh-cut lilacs and it says
bring the beauty of fresh cuts lilacs
indoors with a blend of lilac blossoms
and spring musk forget the must there is
no mosque in there it literally just
smells like lilacs so I get this sent
every single year they did change the
name again but it is the same one as
last year's what was it called lilac
blossom yeah so savings accent amazing
lovely so much so i also got those for
the living room and then i purchased one
that i have never smelled before this is
called indigo sky and i am going to burn
this it doesn't even have a lid in that
weird just had like a little sheet but
anyways i'm going to burn this in our
bedroom it really smells good and i had
at the feeling it was going to smell
kind of manly and honestly my boyfriend
because he spent a lot of time in the
bedroom as well i thought that it might
be nice to have kind of a more like a
family candle in there you're really
just smells good and it says nothing but
indigo skies from now on with this
fragrance of deep blue air sun-dappled
orange blossoms and soft amber so really
really nice subtle scent I think he's
going to enjoy it and I really like the
frosted glass I just don't like that
there is no lid for it so we're going to
burn that in the master bedroom and then
we have endless weekend and I'm thinking
of again no lid but i'm thinking of
burning this in the beauty room since
right now i just have a little candle
there that like literally is not a three
with candle that is just sitting there
and looking kind of strange so I
probably will start burning this one
after this video but um yeah this is a
mixture of it blend a fresh summer
Mandarin sunkissed Magnolia and blue
coconut water that evokes days of
sunshine and happiness you wish would
never end and it really just smells good
it smells like it's going to be kind of
light so maybe it won't have a huge sent
through which is fine because this room
is quite small and I mean I feel like no
matter what you can smell a candle in
this room so yeah super excited to have
that one that one is endless weekend and
then the next three way candle I got i'm
also going to burn in the beauty room
this is lemon
and T I got this last year it smells
very strongly of lemon not a lot of tea
or mint and marriage will see you guys
know but I am a huge fan of citrus sense
so it says refreshing spearmint leaves
combined with fresh zesty lemon and
verbena to delight to your senses so you
can smell a little bit of spearmint in
there but for the most part it's lemon
and it smells really really good and
yeah I'm excited to burn that in the
beauty room as well and then they last
three with candle I got we're going to
burn in our guest bathroom and this is
the sugared peony and petals my favorite
flowers are peonies I just love the way
they smile and look and it says treat
yourself to the sweet scent of sugared
peony petals atop swirls of rich vanilla
buttercream and peas can be kind of a
strong son so excuse me oh just choking
on my own words um Viennese can be quite
a strong scent by themselves so I really
do like that they mix this with a little
bit of fresh what is it buttercream or
like frosting kind of sense like a
little bit of vanilla really really
smells good and that is what is the
outer packaging looks like super super
pretty alright so those are all of the
three macam oh my god I think I got
eight of them yeah eight of them and
then I picked up for deep cleansing hand
soaps I do like the foaming formula like
I like the gentle foaming formula that
one has actually really been helping my
wrist not to get too dried out with like
eczema however my boyfriend and I really
do prefer the deep cleansing formula
just because it really does deeply
cleanse your hands and I feel like they
sometimes are a little more CENTAC than
the foaming ones I don't know why I
think that but I just really like
heavily fragranced items so anyway I
picked up four more of those the first
one I got is the beautiful day deep
cleansing hand soap it is a blend of
Sunkist apple sparkling cassis and white
do you let wild daisies this is what it
looks like really really pretty it
doesn't matter what it looks like
because we actually put these in soaps
leaves except in the kitchen but it
smells really really good I think we'll
probably have this maybe I'll put it in
the guest bathroom it smells a little
too sweet for my boyfriend's liking so I
think I'll put this one in the guest
bathroom and then the second one we got
we're going to have in the kitchen this
is the pink grapefruit to deep cleansing
hand soap and this is a
citrus blend of ripe pink grapefruits
and Valencia orange picked from the tree
oh my god I literally just pulled a
strand of hair right out of my pony all
right so anyway yeah Valencia orange and
pink grapefruit so let's take a whiff of
this one oh yeah it just smells really
really good at very very citrusy and
fresh and yeah we're going to have that
in the kitchen and then I got peach
bellini which is one we will also have
in the Keith Kiki chair the kitchen
which is long we will also have in the
kitchen I love this one I purchase it
every year it is a delicious twist of
juicy peach White's apricot and fresh
mango it doesn't smell as strongly of
peaches like the georgia peach scent
which I really love but I definitely
have the mixture of mango and apricot
and things like that in there so really
really nice kitchen scent and then the
last one I thought is wild honeysuckle
and I think we will have this in the
master bathroom and this is a beautiful
blend of fresh honeysuckle and freesia
with white woods oh it smells so good I
love the scent of lilac and honeysuckle
who else is with me like those are
beautiful scented flowers all right and
then the last three things or two things
we got to wear some wallet while Allah
wallflowers I keep saying we but I i
purchase all this stuff I'm the one who
really likes to have the home smelling
very very fresh and clean so anyway I
did say that we got to Z I believe it's
lavender freesia or lavender lilac
wallflowers but I went ahead and plug
those in already in the living room
because I just got back from like a
10-day trip and honestly I'm always
scared that like things are gonna be
smelling bad when i get home for
whatever reason probably though they
haven't been burning candles while i'm
gone so i already plugged those in but
the other little sets that i thought i'd
really like getting not the single bulbs
but the little duo ones because they're
a better deal so i got ocean driftwood
and we're going to have this in the
hallway it smells really nice kind of
manly smells kind of similar to mahogany
teak wood and then i'm going to have
white citrus in the beauty room because
i love citrus and i love this white
citrus scent so anyway that is my spring
at Bath &amp;amp; Body Works haul and hope you
guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for joining it and I will see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
