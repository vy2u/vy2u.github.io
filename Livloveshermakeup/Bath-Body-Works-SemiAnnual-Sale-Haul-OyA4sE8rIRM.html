because I'm having a great day today i'm
sharing a call with you and it's not
just haul it is a hologram that the body
works I love everybody works and i love
it when they have their semi-annual sale
as you can see so when they have my
family in Los video most of their size
fifty percent seventy-five percent off
and it's just the best time to I stuff
oh please just got a little tub here
gotta move like wood things back there
good okay max a little cat running
around this just has the best laying
down here its most accurate the most
fluorescent the most unflattering but
it's the best for you guys to see and
also you know we're doing some
renovation like downstairs so that's why
their stuff around here it's late at
night and I just couldn't be bothered to
move it I'm sorry I'll wait for the next
video I promise anyway so it's been bad
body works and if there's anything will
sail I went in store and picked up some
goodies um share with you guys what I
got so the first thing I got oh and i do
want to say i have had bag anyways were
probably back in half and it's been
crazy because i want to burn the candles
i want to use the soaps I want to do all
that stuff and I haven't been able to
however I did cheat a little bit my
teeth stuff I did use one of the hand
soap you know but there are things that
I didn't even have felt you know pretend
i didn't easy it anyway we're gonna
start with something i did you but i'm
good i already started to use this is
the white barn cherry blossom sangria
scented candle this is the little mixing
jar candle these are the mini ones and
in toronto for two dollars a piece and I
just thought it was so cute and you know
you can reuse these containers and who
doesn't love little tiny weeks and jars
like they're so cute especially a little
new ones but anyway this is a great
sense luggage that I did start burning
in these little ones go through very
very quickly obviously the pepper smell
but they were on sale for two dollars
they're not only four dollars and fifty
cents but this particular fragrance
peach cherry blossom sangria is says
it's uh what does it say so celebrates
bring it with the sweet scent of sangria
made with fresh ground
nectar I'm sorry fresh cheering vector
Crisp apple slices and a hint of wild
raspberry so it's really really sweet
smelling really really love it and I
just left a little panting I'm really
impressed by this actually I put it in
my room and it basically fills up the
whole room it's not going to fill up a
house because it's so small you need one
of the three wick candles for that but
this little mini one really did feel up
my room nicely with a good fragrance so
very happy with that the second thing i
got was the best body works pink peonies
in Paris gentle foaming hand soap I am a
huge fan of the deep cleansing hand
soaps from Bath and Body Works I've used
them exclusively in my bathroom in my
kitchen and I buy them all the time and
so I don't know I saw this in store and
I think that they have a foaming hand
soap and then this is one of the big
ones the gentle alone I was drawn in by
it it just has this really big packaging
it seems like you get a lot of product I
just thought the packaging so cute and
my favorite flower is peonies so of
course I had to get this sent so pink
peonies appears and I did use this once
and I told myself no more not maybe it's
been can tell you filled with video um
but I did these it once and I really
really loved but it did clean my hands
but it did not leave them feeling dry so
this may be a really good option for
people have sensitive skin or people you
know anybody in the wintertime who
doesn't want something too harsh on so
really happy with that another thing
that I picked up and also have used is
the gelato candle this is just the
single wick candle and I'm very
disappointed it is not burning evenly
I've got the body works usually you know
there's three what candles burn Ruby
evenly from me but this one is not so
probably won't pick up any more of these
just single wit candles however this is
called the swamp candle and it was ten
dollars however it was two dollars I'm
not quite sure if it's the scent or what
but this one was to dollar so it was the
same price at the tiny little mini mason
jar one so very impressive but this
scent is really really sweet it says it
is a creamy sweet blend of raspberry and
strawberry with an effervescent spun
sugar finish that
the perfect fragrance indulgence is it
bravo Bravo so it's very very nice
smelling um and I think it's very very
cute now my next I got a body mist
because like I need more of those but I
got country apple which is one that I
already have but I love the fragrance I
think it can be worn in year-round it's
like sweet it's you know it's sweet for
summer it smells like apples going into
fall you know you can really wear at any
time of the year and it's just it's so
fresh no matter what time of year you
wear it it's so fresh and um I just like
the body mess you know like when you get
all the shower everybody kind of stick
on the skin it just smells great so this
is the fine fragrance mist and I think
this would like two dollars like I said
I do have one of these in the older
packaging but I want to get one can you
were packaging too because I left say
that much hopefully won't see that well
alright move them next I've got
something that I've never tried before
this is the jingle Bellini shimmer list
so this is a signature collection and
this was originally $14 i think i got it
for around four dollars and basically
it's like a shimmer mist so you spray it
and you get like a beautiful clean to
your skin and this particular scent just
really driven it's not really really
sweet kind of like baked good doubles
which I personally really like and I
kind of like a shame lay something on my
skin because I don't self tan and any
kind of glow I can have cake so anyway
got the g gubellini haven't tried that
yet but we will see how it goes next I
got a one of the Handy back which is
there enter bacterial ham sprays I love
their tiny little um antibacterial like
jealous i use those all the time I have
them in my purse I happen like in my
wallet I have them all over so I had
never seen the hands break so basically
it's just a hand sanitizer
and you just spray it right onto a hand
so it's really really clean it's really
efficient and you get a lot of products
in her so this was like one or two
dollars and the scent i got was japanese
cherry blossom so really really excited
for that i did use it once or twice left
um the signs I liked how nice you know
my hands felt it won't dry my hands out
it's so much more efficient with spray
however the gel has had better like
fragrance watching all right yes wrapped
up here this is the Pure Barre which is
one of the signature scents from bath
and Bodyworks a beautiful mix of
strawberry and pear it's wonderful and
luscious and perfect and this is their
shade and fighting with a shower gel I
normally don't buy shower gels from bath
and body works normally they're twelve
dollars fifty cents i think i got this
for like four dollars however i'm out of
shower gel up here at the cabin so i
thought i might as well get this and
love the pear berry sent I heard y'all
that I like that scent Lily yes my kid
is crying um so I earning I love that
scent so I just thought well what the
heck so yes I got peppered with candle
and the one I got is called citral
cedarwood 2014 it looks like this and I
did bring us a little bit because it
smells so good okay this is like the
brother to mahogany teak wood if you
like that kind of Nan wavelet sexy
abercrombie and fitch sent you would
love the seat clamps cedar wood it says
it is a blend of elegance cedar thrives
in the countryside of southern france
and is at the heart of this family brand
of fresh citrus and green boss these are
now $22 and coupe du sons yes sorry the
way we're we're there 22 dollars and
fifty cents for one hour director thing
for a living or space so happy with that
moving on another favorite candle I got
the georgia peach this is just a classic
sweet sweet sweet not overly sweet but
it might be for some people very very
sweet um peach sent basically and it
does there's nothing sweeter than a
blend of Georgia peaches do carpet beats
and a hint of cream eating a lot so
one of those and the last thing i got
this is under 10 minutes the last thing
I want was this which I ever excused I
don't know why I wrapped it back up to
try and show you guys I think you yet oh
I've used it you can see this is the
aromatherapy bath and body works
aromatherapy I love their aromatherapy
line beautiful I believe in a row with
everything this is the tangle o or tan
tan chulo te lo tengo lo I think it's
tangle of woods body wash and foam bath
I used it as a bubble bath or a phone
back and we just put a few ounces into
warm wanting warm running water and it's
a lift your spirits Mandarin and
bergamot essential oils help lift your
mood and figure out your mind and it
smells amazing it really did make me
feel happy when I'm refusing it and I'm
sure it would work really well as if I'd
watch as well so any weight fat with my
hogs out the body were to be semi annual
sale I hope you guys enjoyed this video
if you did please give it a thumbs up
and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
