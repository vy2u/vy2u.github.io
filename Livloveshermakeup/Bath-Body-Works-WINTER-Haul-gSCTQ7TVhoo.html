thank you so much for joining me I hope
you guys are having a fantastic day um
excuse me if I am sniffling in this
video I'm definitely coming down with
something
I just recorded a video right before
this one and I was like yes I think I'm
coming down with something and like
within the past ten minutes it's like I
have a cold um but anyway today I am
sharing a big bath and Bodyworks a
winter haul with you guys I picked up a
bunch of winter stuff a bunch of winter
sense I picked up wallflowers three wick
candles deep cleansing hand soaps their
pocket backs and also I got this Black
Friday deal where they had they give
away like a bag every single year to
like a certain amount of people if you
type in a code at checkout and it's
supposed to be worth a hundred dollars
or has like a hundred dollars worth of
product in it and you get it for twenty
dollars so I got that as well I will
show you guys that at the end um but
anyway let's just get started I have a
huge huge box here I'm going to start
with the three bit candles unfortunately
one of them did break on the way here
I'm gonna call them and see if maybe
they can send me a new one I don't know
what their policy is on like returns do
you guys do that if your candles break
you send them back right that's normal
right that's not mean of me because I
love candles and I'm so sad that one of
them shattered but it happens sometimes
so anyway um like I said I'm gonna start
with the three wick candles because they
are my favorite and also they're really
big and I want to get them out of the
way the first one I got was a fresh
balsam and I get this every single year
it smells like a Christmas tree yep
exactly like a Christmas tree and it is
a mix of snow dusted balsam fir trees
and eucalyptus leaves so that is the
first one I got the second one I got is
my all-time favorite winter scent from
Bath and Body Works in the candles it is
the dista season so good you guys
it's got like cinnamon and apples and
maybe some berries or something
they say it's a mix of bright red apples
freshly ground cinnamon and deep green
pine I don't really smell any pine in
there but super sweet-smelling really
really good actually I think I love this
in every single form they should make a
deep cleansing hand soap with
because I would love it but I like this
too for the wallflower plugins but it's
the best with the candle I feel like the
candle really warms the scent up nicely
and it's just amazing all right the next
one I got was marshmallow fireside I get
this every year people are obsessed
about with us about this and with this
it smells like a marshmallow and burning
woods and I do like it I think it's cozy
I don't think they have the greatest
throw no matter if it's like boy barn or
the other brand every single year they
really don't have a great throw so I
don't know if it's just the scent is
supposed to be subtle but I like strong
scents but this is a mix of scrumptious
vanilla marshmallows and smoldering
woods Wow I kind of got that spot on so
love that one the next one I got almost
broke it looks like cuz the wax is kind
of like flaky I'm not quite sure how I
feel about this one this is a new one
for me it is the fresh sparkling snow
and it really smells like I don't know
one of their summer sentence for some
reason and I really like I don't know
like warmer sentence during the fall and
the winter time so I'm a little confused
with this one it says it is a blend of
icy pear frozen melon it's probably the
melon in there that's making it small
summary to me and frosted musk so I'll
still burn it but I don't think I would
repurchase this one and then the last
one I got to is frosted cranberry which
I get every single year this is very
sweet smelling but not like summery
sweet like it smells like there's
cranberries on a tree but like in the
picture they have frost on them you know
it's like a wintery sweet smell and it
is a blend of white cranberry juicy
peach and ripe red or raspberries so
those are the three McCandles I got
super super excited to burn those let's
go through the deep cleansing hand soaps
the first one I got is Mary cookie it
looks like this by the way the packaging
this year is so cute on this this is a
blend of buttery sugar cookies iced with
vanilla bourbon frosting yep it smells
exactly like that just really really
buttery very very like vanilla like and
delicious alright the second one I got
was the fresh sparkling snow and
the candles I got right yeah I'm just
not huge and super keen on this scent
we'll probably use this in the kitchen
sink area so goes through quickly but
like I said it's a blend of icy pear
melon and frosted musk it doesn't really
smell that much like musk but look at
the packaging you guys can you see that
it's got sparkles all over it it is so
cute I almost don't want to put these in
our soap sleeves and then a winter
wonderland beautiful let's smell this
one
mmm this one's nice very very um wintery
it says it is winter berries snowy
vanilla and crystallized ginger and
again love the packaging this year they
put like little imprints that like you
know like it's like those little
sparkles that go above like the picture
like you can feel it it's like textured
and then I got snow kissed citrus again
beautiful packaging and this one is just
really nice it smells like citrus I like
to put stuff like this in our main
bathroom because my boyfriend gets to
like pick me up from citrus scents and I
feel like it's kind of unisex you know
this is sugary winter lemons like listen
in the first snowfall so really like
that and then the last one is my
favorite it is new to me this year I
think this is the new one in general
look at the packaging can you guys see
that it's so beautiful this is orchard
Frost
smells like apples if you love apples
you would love this it says embrace the
magic of snow kiss days and sparkling
nights it doesn't really say actually oh
sorry frosted apples shine in winter
sunlight and it really smelled like that
it just smells like fresh crisp air and
apples and I love the scent of Apple
definitely my favorite one that I got so
now I know which one I will be
repurchasing alright moving on I did get
five pop pop I can never say these
pocket backs they're like they're little
mini sanitizers this was like a
prepackaged five pack and it was $4 so
you get frosted cranberry in here you
get fresh sparkling snow
you get winter wonderland you get
orchard frost which I know will be my
favorite and you also get iced white
pomegranate that sounds amazing and I
just like to have those in my purse
basically when I'm doing the makeup on
my table anytime I just like to use it
alright moving on to wallflowers I got
the little duo packs because we usually
have two going in each room if that
makes sense
so we have two wallflowers in the living
room and then we have two in my Beauty
room and that's it actually yeah my
boyfriend's a little sensitive to scent
so he can only handle the candles in the
bedroom and in his office so anyway um
frosted cranberry these are the first
ones I got these were a really good deal
they were like half the price yeah like
half off I also got twisted peppermint
next I got sparkling icicles which I
think I confused the fresh sparkling
snow scent with this one because last
year this was an amazing scent it smells
like a sexy masculine man like if you
like those smells like mahogany teak
wood and new york black tie things like
that that this smells are really really
similar so I think I can fuse the two
because when I opened that one I was
like the smell is good as I remember but
this is the one that's really good
sparkling icicles
I gotta order that in candle form for
sure and then the last one I got is a
winter candy apple which is basically
just kind of a sweeter sort of scent
I'll probably have that in here in my
beauty room I just dropped it on the
floor alright moving on let's go through
that little bag that they gave me let me
grab it so like I said this was $20 on
Black Friday it's actually really cute
it's like a purse as you guys can see
it's super super shiny it's got a pocket
in the back and it's a nice size I could
probably carry my flute in here honestly
so anyway inside they have a bunch of
goodies so let's go ahead and see
what we get in here and I do think it is
a good deal for $20 because there is a
three lip candle in here and those are
normally just regularly $20 I'm super
excited about this though this is the
joyful hand soap but this is their new
one this is called the luxury hand soap
I believe look at the beautiful
beautiful bottle aren't those amazing
absolutely gorgeous let's smell it it
smells really good I think everything
has this particular scent in the kit but
I'm super excited about this I think
this is beautiful I'm gonna have that at
the kitchen sink because I think it's so
pretty and then you get the body mist in
be joyful and these lasts forever um I
have a lot of these myths from Bath and
Body Works and I like to pair them with
my performances oh that smells really
really good I'm glad I like the scent
because if it was like fresh sparkling
snow I probably wouldn't but this is a
nice scent it smells a little perfume me
and a little like warm kind of warm
perfumey mixed together then you get the
full-size shower gel in be joyful super
cute and then you get the full-size be
joyful Shea and vitamin E body lotion
and then the last thing you get which
I'm most excited about of course is the
candle because I think that's what makes
it worth it totally
that ends the hand soap it is spiced
apple toddy I did not know that this was
in here I love this scent it smells so
good I'm kind of glad it wasn't to be
joyfull one even though that was really
nice this is more up my alley
YUM alright so this is a mix of wintery
fruits apple brandy and spiced plum so
super super excited to burn that and I
think the bag is quite cute I mean if it
wasn't so metallic it would probably be
cuter but it's not like the most ugly
thing on the planet
I could definitely use it for something
groceries or carrying my flute but yeah
that is my back and Body Works winter
haul I hope you guys enjoyed this video
if you did please give it a thumbs up
and I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
