thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a fantastic day um
excuse me if I am sniffling in this
video I'm definitely coming down with
something I just recorded a video right
before this one and I was like yeah I
think I'm coming down with something and
like within the past 10 minutes it's
like I have a cold um but anyway today i
am sharing a big bath and body works
winter haul with you guys i picked up a
bunch of winter stuff a bunch of winter
sense i picked up wallflowers 3 wick
candles deep cleansing hand soaps their
pocket backs and also i got this black
friday deal where they had they give
away like a bag every single year to
like a certain amount of people if you
type in a code at checkout and it's
supposed to be worth a hundred dollars
or has like a hundred dollars worth of
product in it and you get it for twenty
dollars so i got that as well i will
show you guys that at the end um but
anyway let's just get started I have a
huge huge box here I'm going to start
with the 3-bit candles unfortunately one
of them did break on the way here i'm
going to call them and see if maybe they
can send me a new one I don't know what
their policy is on like returns do you
guys do that if your candles break you
send them back right that's normal right
that's not mean of me because I love
candles and I'm so sad that one of them
shattered but it happens sometimes so
anyway um like I said I'm going to start
with the three wit candles because they
are my favorite and also they're really
big and I want to get him out of the way
the first one I got was a fresh of
balsam and I get this every single year
it smells like a Christmas tree yep
exactly like a Christmas tree and it is
a mix of snow dusted balsam fir trees
and eucalyptus leaves so that is the
first one I got the second one I got is
my all-time favorite winter scent from
bath and body works in the candles it is
the tistheseason so good you guys it's
got like cinnamon and apples maybe some
berries or something they say its a mix
of bright red apples freshly ground
cinnamon and deep green pine I don't
really smell any pine in there but super
sweet smelling really really good
actually i think i love this in every
single form they should make a deep
cleansing
so with this one because I would love it
but I like this too for the wallflower
plugins but it's the best with the
candle i feel like the candle really
warms the scent up nicely and it's just
amazing alright the next one I got was
marshmallow fireside I get this every
year people are obsessed about with us
about this and with this it smells like
a marshmallow and burning woods and I do
like it i think it's cozy I don't think
they have the greatest throw no matter
if it's like white barn or the other
brand every single year they really
don't have a great throw so I don't know
if it's just the scent is supposed to be
subtle but I like strong sense but this
is a mix of scrumptious vanilla
marshmallows and smoldering woods Wow I
kind of got that spot on so love that
one the next one I got almost broke it
looks like cuz the wax is kind of like
flaky I'm not quite sure how I feel
about this one this is a new one for me
it is fresh sparkling snow and it really
smells like I don't know one of their
summer scents for some reason and I
really like I don't know like warmer
sentence during the fall and the winter
time so I'm a little confused with this
one it says it is a blend of icy pair of
frozen melon it's probably the melon in
there that's making it small summary to
me and frosted musk so I'll still burn
it but I don't think I would repurchase
this one and then the last 1i got to is
frosted cranberry which I get every
single year this is very sweet smelling
but not like summary sweet like it
smells like there's cranberries on a
tree but like in the picture they have
frost on them you know it's like a
wintry sweet smell and it is a blend of
white cranberry juicy peach and ripe red
raspberries so those are the three with
candles I got super super excited to
burn those let's go through the deep
cleansing hand soaps the first one I got
is Mary cookie it looks like this by the
way the packaging this year is so cute
on this this is a blend of buttery sugar
cookies iced with vanilla bourbon
frosting yep it smells exactly like that
just really really buttery very very
like vanilla like and delicious all
right the second one I got was the fresh
sparkling snow and yeah
the candle I got right yeah i'm just not
huge and super keen on this scent will
probably use this in the kitchen sink
area so it goes through quickly but like
i said it's a blend of ICP or melon and
frosted musk doesn't really smell that
much like musk but look at the packaging
you guys can you see that it's got
sparkles all over it it is so cute I
almost don't want to put these in our
soap sleeves um and then winter
wonderland beautiful let's smell this
one mmm this one's nice very very um
wintry it says it is winter very snowy
vanilla and crystallized ginger and
again love the packaging this year they
put like little imprints that like you
know like it's like those little
sparkles that go above like the picture
like you can feel it it's like textured
and then I got snow kissed citrus again
beautiful packaging and this one is just
really nice it smells like citrus I like
to put stuff like this in our main
bathroom because my boyfriend gets up
you like pick me up from citrus scents
and I feel like it's kind of neat
effects you know this is sugary winter
lemons like listen in the first snowfall
so really like that and then the last
one is my favorite it is new to me this
year I think this is a new one in
general look at the packaging can you
guys see that it's so beautiful this is
orchard frost smells like apples if you
love apples you would love this it says
embrace the magic of snow kiss phase and
sparkling nights um it doesn't really
say actually oh sorry frosted apples
shine in winter sunlight and it really
smelled like that it just smells like
fresh crisp air and apples and I love
the scent of Apple definitely my
favorite one that I got so now I know
which one I will be repurchasing alright
moving on I did get five pop Papa's oh I
can never say these pocket backs they're
like their little mini sanitizers this
was like a prepackaged five pack and it
was four dollars so you get frosted
cranberry in here you get fresh
sparkling snow
you get winter wonderland we get orchard
frost which I know will be my favorite
and you also get iced white pomegranate
that sounds amazing and I just like to
have those in my purse basically when
I'm doing the makeup on my table anytime
I just like to use it alright moving on
to wallflowers I got the little duo
packs because we usually have two going
in each room of that make sense so we
have two wallflowers in the living room
and then we have two in my beauty room
and that's it actually yeah my
boyfriend's a little sensitive descent
so he can only handle the candles in the
bedroom and in his office so anyway um
frosted cranberry these are the first
ones i got these were a really good deal
they were like half the price um yeah
like half off i also got twisted
peppermint next I got sparkling icicles
which I think I confused the fresh
sparkling snow sent with this one
because last year this was an amazing
scent it smells like a sexy masculine
man like if you like those smells like
mahogany teak wood and New York black
tie things like that that this smells
really really similar so I think I
confuse the two because when I opened
that one I was like smell as good as I
remember but this is the one that's
really good sparkling icicles I got to
order that in candle form for sure and
then the last one I got is winter candy
apple which is basically just kind of a
sweeter sort of sent i'll probably have
that in here in my beauty room I just
dropped it on the floor alright moving
on let's go through that little bag that
they gave me let me grab it so like I
said this was twenty dollars on black
friday it's actually really cute it's
like a purse as you guys can see it's
super super-shiny it's got a pocket in
the back and it's a nice size I could
probably carry my fleeting here honestly
um so anyway inside they have a bunch of
goodies so let's go ahead and see
what we get in here and I do think it is
a good deal for twenty dollars because
there is a three lit candle in here and
those are normally just regularly twenty
dollars I'm super excited about this
though this is the joyful hand soap but
this is their new one this is called the
luxury and so I believe look at the
beautiful beautiful bottle aren't those
amazing absolutely gorgeous let's smell
it it smells really good I think
everything has this particular scent in
the kit but I'm super excited about this
I think this is beautiful i'm gonna have
that at the kitchen sink because i think
it's so pretty and then you get the body
mist in be joyful and these last forever
um i have a lot of these myths from Bath
and Body Works and I like to pair them
with my perfumes oh that smells really
really good i'm glad i like the sense
because if it was like fresh darklings
know i probably wouldn't but this is a
nice scent smells a little perfume me
and a little um like warm kind of warm
perfumey mixed together then you get the
full-size shower gel in be joyful super
cute and then you get the full-size be
joyful Shea and vitamin E body lotion
and then the last thing you get which
i'm most excited about of course is the
candle because i think that's what makes
it worth it totally that ends the hand
soap it is spiced apple toddy i did not
know that this was in here i love this
scent smells so good I'm kind of glad it
wasn't to be joyful one even though that
was really nice this is more up my alley
YUM alright so this is a mix of wintry
fruits apple brandy and spiced plum so
super super excited to burn that and I
think the bag is quite cute I mean if it
wasn't so metallic it would probably be
cuter um but it's not like the most ugly
thing on the planet I could definitely
use it for something groceries or
carrying my flute um but yeah that is my
back and body works winter hall I hope
