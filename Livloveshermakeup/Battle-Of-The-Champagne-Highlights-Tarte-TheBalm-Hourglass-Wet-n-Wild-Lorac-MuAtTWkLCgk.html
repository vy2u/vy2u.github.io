this video we have a battle a battle of
the champagne highlights so we're going
to be talking about a bunch of different
champagne colored highlights recently
I've been getting a lot of questions
about to the tart exposed highlight and
people have been asking is it similar to
Mary Lou or Illamasqua or whatever and I
thought that we would just kind of go
over some high-end um like you know
champagne highlights but also I think I
have two or three drugstore options as
well and I'm going to be swatching them
I'm going to tell you if they would be
good for your particular skin tone or
type and then at the end I'm going to
share with you guys my top three so
let's go ahead and get started alright
so I guess we will just start with the
tart um exposed highlights so this is
what tart exposed highlight looks like
it's beautiful it is very very champagne
E and it actually has a bit of a nude
undertone the actual consistency of it
feels very similar to like a foiled
eyeshadow I would say it has a very
foiled appearance on the skin and it
also just feels it very foiled it's very
creamy and buttery this sits on the skin
so beautifully I don't care if you have
dry skin if you have aging skin whatever
this will not sink into your fine lines
and pores so I do feel like it is a
product that will be beautiful on any
sort of skin type and as far as skin
Tonee is concerned even though this is
darker than my skin tone even when I'm
self-tanning this still gives me the
most beautiful glow and if you don't
believe me I will link the video down
below where I reviewed the product you
can see the glow it's gorgeous
although it's not actually technically
lighter than my skin it still can make
you glow so this is a beautiful one and
I think it's absolutely absolutely
stunning alright and the next one we are
going to talk about is from hourglass
and actually no let's go ahead and do
Mary Lu because everybody wants to know
if this is similar to Tarte exposed so
in my opinion um Mary Lu definitely has
a little more of like golden I know it
just has a little more of like a light
gold thing going on if that makes sense
let me hold the two next to each other
so you guys can see so here we have Mary
Lu and then here we have charge
obviously you get a lot more product
with Mary Lu but in my opinion I feel
like the Tarte highlighter has a lot
more like beige and also just kind of
neutral undertones whereas this one
leans more on the yellow
so let me go ahead and swatch it for you
guys you get a lot of product in here my
only complaint with the mary-lou manizer
is that it breaks all the freaking time
I feel like if this would be beautiful
on a lot of different skin tones though
I personally can pull this off I think
it's gorgeous it does remind me a little
bit of Becca's moonstone shimmering skin
perfecter which I'm not including in
this video because I feel like that
really really leans yellow and that's
not really what we're talking about
we're just talking about champagne
colors that lean a little pink or a
little warm but I feel like if you have
a warm undertone Mary Lou would look
beautiful on you it works for my fair
skin tone I think it would work on deep
complexions and same goes for the Tarte
highlight I feel like this would also
work on deep complexions it works on my
complexion and or you know my skin color
and I just think it's beautiful this one
has a little more neutral undertones
alright the next one is from the
drugstore and this is from a wet and
wild this is the color icon bronzer with
SPF 15 in the shade reserve your combat
Cabana cabana I almost didn't want to
talk about this because it's barely
there sort of highlight but it really
does give a gorgeous gorgeous dusting of
like champagne goodness to your face you
can actually set in your under eyes with
this product you can do a lot of things
with it
there it is swatched on the back of my
hand it definitely has that sort of
champagne look to it and I think it's
absolutely stunning on fair skin tones
deeper skin tones again if you really
want it to be super shiny and wham-bam
in your face you do need to build it up
but that is a really good option from
the drugstore and you get a hell of a
lot of product in here this thing is
huge
alright and the next one I want to talk
about is from hourglass this is one of
my all-time favorite highlights it is
the ambient strobing lighting powder in
the shade brilliant it is absolutely
beautiful this definitely leans more on
the although it does have like a
champagne base it has more of a warm
undertone I would say in my opinion it's
beautiful very finely milled I feel like
it goes onto the skin very very
beautifully and so does that wet wild
one as well if you guys are curious so
here is the wet and wild and then here
is the hourglass you can see the
hourglass has a little more warm
undertones and I feel like the wet and
wild is a little more on the neutral
side but both of those are beautiful if
you are looking for a highlight as it
still has these
any qualities to it without being too
heavy and like shiny on the face if
you're not into like what I have going
on today then those two would be great
options for you all right the next two I
want to talk about are from Laura Geller
and we have let's see here the big tie
lighter in French vanilla and we also
have the baked I cannot give you own
what's happening why are you slumming
around like that all right we have
french vanilla and we also have the
baked highlighter in golden rose so here
is french vanilla here is golden rose
this one leans more warm toned this one
leans more cool toned more pink toned
they're both very very beautiful I love
the way that these go on the skin
because they never overemphasize any
sort of texture so if you do have aging
or if you do have you know like fine
lines and fine lines and wrinkles
basically on your skin aging skin is
what I should have said if you do have
aging skin you actually can use these I
think they go on so so nicely I feel
like that Tarte highlight just glides on
like butter on every single kind of skin
type but some of these are a little more
like you have to work with them a little
more depending on what kind of skin type
you do have but I feel like if these are
a really nice option as well for every
single I was going to say single I
cannot speak today every single skin
type so we have let's see here oh yes we
have golden rose on the top and then
French vanilla more pink toned if you
have cool undertones and then more warm
toned if you do have warm undertones
pink yellow both really beautiful both
have that champagne quality to them on
the skin both of those will show up
pretty well even on deeper skin tones
but if you have really really really
deep skin I'm not quite sure if those
would show up because I actually have a
friend at work who tried to use French
vanilla one day and this thing like she
was trying and trying and trying it just
would not show up so I would recommend
something more like Mary Lu or something
like the Tarte exposed for really really
deep skin tones alright the next one I
want to talk about is um the Josie Maran
Argan enlightenment aluminized veil and
when I hold this up and next to the
Tarte exposed I feel like they both have
that sort of Tears tart and here is the
UM con josie maran argan oil so I feel
like they both have that champagne e
glow to them but at the same time they
both have nude undertones or like
neutral undertones which i think is
awesome i
say the tart one definitely goes onto
the skin a little better than this one
if you do have a lot of texture on your
skin this particular product does have a
little bit of sparkles and glitter in it
so it can't overemphasize that so I
would stay away if you do have like
textured skin or very oily skin things
like that but there is the Josie Maran
it's beautiful it definitely leans a
little more nude or neutral based I
think it's really really stunning though
and I love that one alright the next one
I want to talk about is from the
drugstore and this one it can go either
pink or it can go kind of yellow so this
is the Physicians Formula happy booster
Glo and mood boosting translucent powder
so I don't know why they call it a
powder this is definitely more of a
highlight this is what it looks like it
has little hearts in it and as you can
see you're getting little hearts a pink
and yellow and brown and things like
that and if you mix them all together
you get a very pretty sort of like
champagne e color however you can
actually pick certain black you know you
can pick certain parts of the palette
and then you can build it up to you know
if you want like a really really like
warm undertone or like a cool undertone
so there it is on my hand as you can see
it kind of reminds me of the wet and
wild one not super super wham-bam in
your face I'm not quite sure that this
Physicians Formula one would show up on
every single skin tone I feel like you
really have to work it up if you do have
tan to kind of deeper skin tones but if
you do have fair skin it's beautiful and
you can dip your brush in certain areas
or you can mix it all together really
really love that I think this one we are
going to be talking about is the
illamasqua beyond powder illuminator in
the shade oh my god there it is and it
is oh my god it is very beautiful and
shiny
it definitely has more of a warm
undertone as you can probably see I feel
like this is the definition of champagne
it is so so so pretty and I think this
is beautiful
I feel like if this is so air light just
got the pigmentation right I feel like
this is so air light on the skin that
this is definitely going to be OK for
anybody no matter what kind of texture
you have on your face if you have big
pores if you have fine lines wrinkles
the actual consistency of this is so
easy to blend and is so beautiful there
it is blended that I feel like this
would work for really anybody my only
come
is that Illamasqua is not sold in the US
anymore so that kind of sucks if you are
overseas though and you really want a
nice highlight that's not going to sink
in and emphasize you know texture and
pores then definitely check that one out
and then they last two that I want to
talk about are from the lorac
illuminating highlighter collection we
have Twilight here and daylight here I
did pick up all four of these and these
two kind of fall into the champagne
category so daylight is definitely more
of that I would say it's got more of
that golden thing going on this one is
very very similar to mary lou so there
is daylight absolutely beautiful
absolutely absolutely beautiful now
these can get a little powdery so if you
do have dry skin they can tend to cling
to certain areas that you don't want
them to cling to but I think it is still
really beautiful I actually want to show
you guys what that one and what mary lou
look like next to each other so you can
see so here is lorac daylight and then
there is mary lou Mary Lou is just a tad
more yellow and then Twilight is really
really stunning as well and this one is
quite close to the tarp exposed so it's
got this really really interesting kind
of almost neutral grayish like nude
undertone and I think that's exactly
what the tart exposed highlight has as
well so here is Laura and then I'm going
to go ahead and swatch the tart right
below it this was the closest I could
find like in color actually you know I
mean even when I look at it now I feel
like the they're very very similar but I
still do feel like a via tart one has a
little more of a neutral undertone so
there is tart there is LaRocca and
Twilight very very very very similar but
overall I would say that this
formulation on the tart one is a lot
better for most like you know skin types
I would say and also skin tones I feel
like the lorac one would show up on a
lot of different skin tones as well
however I just feel like it is quite
powdery and it definitely like doesn't
build very well on itself if that makes
sense I'm stuttering you guys know what
I mean it's very very powdery whereas
the Tarte one has more of like that
baked as you lay sort of formulation not
quite but it has more of like a foiled
sort of consistency all right guys so
those are all of them and now let me
you guys which ones are my top three
picks all right so the first one is the
hourglass ambient lighting breath
ambient lighting powder this is in
brilliant like I said I've been too long
of a day guys and it hadn't even begun
I'm right here in the morning it's like
70 and I'm like I'm done
all right so here is the ambient
lighting powder the brilliant strobing
one and I'm going to swatch that again
I'm going to swatch the top three next
to each other I just think this is so
beautiful and on my particular skin tone
and for my skin type it just glides on
gorgeously and I love the way that that
looks my second pick is definitely the
tarte exposed this has become quickly
like one of my all-time favorite
highlighters I think it's beautiful it's
luxurious you can build it like crazy
and it's gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous and
then the last one is it's actually the
wet and wild all right so this is the
wet and wild a reserve your Cabana and I
just love this I love this on my skin
tone again if you really really deep
skin tones I've no idea if this will
show up on you but it's beautiful it
reminds me a lot of the hourglass one
and those are definitely my top three
champagne highlights all right guys I
hope you enjoyed this video I'm sorry
I'm a little tongue-tied but I hope that
this was helpful and maybe it helps you
kind of like narrow down which ones
maybe you want to try out if you want to
try out a drugstore option or one that's
a little more subtle or one that's
really in your face I think they're all
great and yeah I will see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
