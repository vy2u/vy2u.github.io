want to say really really quickly I have
my ring like turn down all the way in
this video and that is because I have a
headache right now and it is bordering
on migraine territory and I'm scared
that if I turn my ring light up all the
way it's gonna be like I am NOT great
and I just don't want to deal with that
right now I need to go grocery shopping
later like I have stuff to do I cannot
deal with a migraine right now and on
top of that I am NOT like showing any
makeup in this video this video is
actually going to be about deodorants
actually it's going to be about natural
deodorant so I hope that it's okay with
you guys that I turned the lighting down
anyway like I said this video is going
to be all about natural deodorants about
a month and a half ago I hauled well
yeah I went to the drugstore and I
hauled a bunch of like beauty products
and then I also had picked up two
natural deodorants the first one is the
Christie Christian ended the crystal
natural body deodorant roll-on and I
also picked up the tom's of Maine
long-lasting deodorant in the unscented
version and the reason I had picked
these up it was because a week prior to
that I had gotten an all natural
deodorants like deluxe a sample in my
allure Beauty box this is the Schmidt's
natural deodorants in lavender and sage
so if this spark like a lot of like not
anyone's a controversy in the comments
section whatsoever it wasn't controversy
but a lot of people were like talking
this got people talking in the comment
section people were saying in you to a
video on like a follow up on that
particular deodorant the Schmidt's one
everybody seemed really really focused
and interested in the natural deodorant
out of all of these samples that I had
gotten everybody was like can you keep
us updated on that so I went ahead and
went to the drugstore picked up some
more natural deodorants cuz I was like
you know what I wouldn't do like a
battle of the natural deodorants or like
natural deodorant Smackdown sort of
video so that I can give you guys an
idea of like which ones in my opinion
work best of course I haven't tried all
of them I only have three of them but I
have found one that's really really good
and I wanted to give you guys that
recommendation I want to say really
really quickly I am naturally one of
those people that loves really really
good smelling products I like deodorants
that aren't gonna leave like a white
pass or whatever underneath my armpit I
hate that like when it transfers I hate
that so I usually go for like the
crappiest deodorants the ones that are
filled with aluminum filled with
fragrance
like the secret clear job sent
expressions in mango tango this is like
my homegirl okay I love this it leaves
no white marks it has a gel it smells
amazing and I always noticed like
because of the aluminum in here I never
got like wet underneath my armpit area
this never transferred and it smelled
great so I always wanted to use this and
then I've kind of got into dove dry
sprays like the dry spray craze where
you basically just spray it underneath
your armpit it keeps you smelling good
all day you can see feeling fresh and on
top of that you get like no wetness
underneath your armpits I was so into
that you guys have probably seen in my
empties video it's like 15 of those kind
of like dove dry spray so that was my
favorite brand the Dove ones so I
started to notice with the Dove ones
like literally when I would be putting
it on I was inhaling like half of this
 okay
like literally I'd be spraying it I know
but it's okay it's okay because you know
it's gonna keep me nice and dry
underneath my armpit um no that is not
healthy like I look back on that and I'm
like oh cheese I mean I'm well aware
that I probably inhale like half of my
face powder when I apply it quick in the
morning but at the same time I just
don't think that's healthy to be like
spray on deodorant and then you have
like this cloud that just like hangs
there in the bathroom of like fragrance
and I was like this can't be healthy so
anyway I obviously like I said I went
and I picked up three natural deodorants
one of them was in the beauty box and
the other two I purchased and I'm gonna
let you guys know which ones I'm liking
and maybe I'll do a follow-up on this
video as well because the one I'm liking
I actually heard from one of my
subscribers maybe it's not as natural as
I thought but anyways let's start with
the two that did not work for me the
first one is the tom's of Maine and
natural odor protection long lasting
deodorant
this is absolutely nothing for me like
the fact that it was unscented I was
just like Kate boring um when you twist
it up it starts to kind of like fall
apart like when you put it on your
actual armpit oh I think there's a
little armpit hair there sorry it's be
real even it real but anyway this is
what it looks like when you start to put
it on your armpit it's just like fall
apart like the formula is just not very
good or very strong and I actually
really like the tom's of Maine
toothpaste like I used to use that as a
child like I really like that but this
was just so not
special at all and I just didn't like it
at all I did not feel like it had
24-hour odor protection whatsoever I
started to smell like within the first
two hours and then on top of that it
didn't offer anything for like wetness
protection so I just felt like this was
definitely not worth the money this one
was probably the most expensive out of
all of them I can lose almost ten
dollars and I understand that they are
all-natural and whatnot you know they
have no animal testing no artificial
colors flavors fragrances or perseveres
with a little uh preservative they share
every ingredient it's perfect its source
they're sustainably practiced like
everything's really really great like I
absolutely stand behind what they do as
a brand but I mean this product just
doesn't work it just doesn't work and I
don't know if maybe the other ones um
that have like a few cents I couldn't
find a scented one I would have
preferred to pick up one that did have a
little bit of scent I don't know if
those are any different if you guys know
leap like leave a comment down you know
in the comments section because I'm
really really curious to see what you
guys think on this topic as well and
also if you have tried natural
deodorants and you have ones that have
worked for you leave it in the comment
section let us know but for the most
part this just was a big fail I didn't
like it I will try and use it up but
maybe it just I don't know I just feel
like I have to keep reapplying it and
I'm like you shouldn't have to do that
with a deodorant so I don't know if I
will try and use this up or if you will
see it in my empties video at the end of
the month um I guess I'll try and if it
doesn't work out then it doesn't work
out but for the most part it really it
really doesn't work out and I love their
photo we believed what's inside is what
matters you know no artificial fragrance
no preservatives no aluminum like I
stand by this whole thing but it just
doesn't work so that one was definitely
a fail the second one was kind of a fail
it depends on if you are someone who can
deal with texture so this is the Schmitz
and natural deodorant in lavender and
sage it says to soften a small dab
between the fingers rub it together and
then you apply it to your skin it says
do not over apply this is the weirdest
deodorant I have ever used in my life I
want to see first of all it smells
beautiful lavender and sage are
absolutely stunning together like a
beautiful beautiful pairing and I really
like the way it smells I almost think it
smells as good as like my Mango Tango
okay so I'd really really like that this
is by the way they are all-natural
they're vegan cruelty-free they have no
lumen of anything like that
so what you're supposed to do is just
weird to have like a deodorant that's a
solid like this that you actually have
to dip your finger into rub it between
your fingers and there it's weird
because there's like cornstarch in here
so there's texture okay this is what it
looks like
you rub it between your fingers and
immediately just you can feel the grip
you can feel the grit and I'm just
uncomfortable with that like I just feel
weird I feel like I'm putting sandpaper
on my armpit and it's strange so what I
like to do is just like tap it
underneath my armpit I want to say right
away the reason that I don't completely
hate this one is because this scent this
will keep you odor free the whole entire
day and I also notice that the
cornstarch in there really really helps
with on the wetness protection so I
think it works it's just I can't get
past the texture do you guys see the
extra little texture that's like on my
fingers right now like it stays like
that and it stays on your hands it stays
on your armpits like that and I don't
like that it starts to kind of piece up
and fall off like imagine if you want to
wear a dress or a light on top you know
you don't want like crumbling deodorant
all over you know what I mean
so I think if you're wearing a long
sleeve shirt I'm wearing it today and I
have my long sleeve shirt on I have been
completely protected as far as wetness
and odor goes all day long but I can
still like when I take my shirt off
tonight and I'm like washing myself like
in the shower
I can feel the grittiness and I just
can't get past it and I just wipe my
hands with a wipe and I can still feel
the grittiness so overall I think this
one actually does work I just can't get
past it I just can't get past like the
process of it putting it on like the
whole like it's it's just strange it's a
texture thing it feels weird and also
like like I said like during the
summertime the last thing I want is
little clumps of like textured deodorant
falling off of my shirts so I don't like
it for that but I do think it protects
against wetness and odor so yeah also it
does leave a little bit of like a white
cast like it will travel basically onto
your clothing at that base
so I also did not like that so anyway
that was just okay I feel like it does
work it's just not you know for me and
then the last one I want to talk about
is the one I love I love this and this
is the crystal body deodorant roll-on
it's hypoallergenic fragrance and
paraben free aluminum free and I love it
I love this it is basically just a clear
little rollerball as you guys can see
and the product goes on completely clear
I'll put some on the back of my hand it
is very very wet as you guys can
probably see so a little goes a long way
The Price is Right on this product this
is under like five dollars at the
drugstore and it had absolutely no sense
but I kind of liked a little like
wetness that it gives underneath the
armpits I'm one of those people like I
love like gels like cooling formulas
like that I really like that in the
morning if you're someone who is like
sensitive to like I don't know the coals
or something like that you might not
like this um but I really really enjoy
it it is a very very liquidy it protects
all day from odor protection and also
wetness protection even though it goes
on really wet it dries very very quickly
and I get absolutely no white marks
underneath my shirts so this has been my
all-time favorite this is the one I want
to recommend to you guys if you are
looking for a natural deodorants however
I got a comment on that haul video a few
weeks ago from one of my subscribers who
said there is some sort of aluminum in
this product it says right here no
aluminum clora chlorohydrate but I don't
know if there's another aluminum
property in here so maybe it's not as
natural as it seems which was probably
why I liked it but I hope that person I
can't remember who it was but I hope
that that subscriber is watching and
comments below and lets me know exactly
what it is that's in here because i did
a little research and I couldn't find
exactly what they were saying from what
I read online this is all natural it is
completely fragrance free
you know paraben free aluminum free but
I am curious if that person like I said
I can't remember who it is but if you
are watching this please leave a comment
below and let me know what it is that's
in here that's not completely natural
because I absolutely love this deodorant
and I
going to use this secret one up and then
toss it and then only buy this from now
on so I feel like maybe there will be a
part two to this video if this is not
completely natural then obviously I will
be only hunt again to find a completely
completely natural one but for the most
part out of the three that I tried the
Tom's won the Schmitz won and the
crystal I would go ahead and pick up the
crystal it's absolutely amazing this is
absolutely my favorite all-natural
deodorant so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video like I said please leave your
comments below these are the only
natural deodorants I've ever tried I've
only tried three so that's not a lot so
I would love to know what you guys think
on this topic what you think on this
subject um what you think about aluminum
fragrance all that kind of stuff going
to lick on your armpit area we know that
there's like a lot of ducks and what do
I want to say like lymph nodes and
glands underneath the armpits do you
think that natural or natural deodorants
are better because they sink into the
bloodstream and it's not as like harsh
do you believe that or do you think it's
just like whatever we already put so
much toxins into our body anyway from
applying makeup or using perfume like it
doesn't matter what do you guys think
I'm curious to know so anyway I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and I will see
you in tomorrow's bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
