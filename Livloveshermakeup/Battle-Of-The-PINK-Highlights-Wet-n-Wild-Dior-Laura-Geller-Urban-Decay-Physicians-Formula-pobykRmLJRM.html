today's video we have another comparison
video this is going to be battle of the
pink highlights so about two and a half
weeks ago on my channel I did a video
called battle of the champagne
highlights and today we are just doing
the same sort of concept I'm gonna go
through a bunch of different highlights
with you guys that are drugstore that
are cream that are high-end and I feel
like I remembered all of the ones that I
have in my collection there may be a few
that I forgot but I tried to collect all
of them I'm gonna go through them I'm
going to swatch them for you guys and
then at the end I'm going to tell you
guys which are my top three I'm also
going to try and tell you guys which
ones I think would be best for your
particular skin tone or your skin type
and yeah let's go ahead and get started
alright so the first pink highlight that
we are going to be talking about and
swatching is the wet and wild
Fergie centerstage collection shimmer
palette in the shade eight zero four
five Rose a champagne
glow this is an amazing amazing
highlight it's very very beautiful you
are getting tons of product in here you
guys you are getting 0.4 ounces or
eleven point three grams which is a lot
so you're getting a lot of product in
here this is a beautiful kind of light
pink shimmery color it's got a lot of
like a rosy sort of undertone it's very
very beautiful and it definitely can be
built up on the skin I'm gonna of course
build up the swatch for you guys but I
think this is just so so so beautiful it
reminds me a lot of one that I will show
you guys in a second which is from
Physicians Formula as you can see you
have this gorgeous sort of white base
with like a nice rosy undertone I think
this is beautiful I think this would
work on a lot of different skin tones
this shows up as a highlight on my
particular skin tone you guys know I'm
quite fair and I do feel like this would
show up on darker complexions as well so
I really really do like this I would
stay away if you do tend to have really
really dry skin or aging skin I find
that this does tend to kind of settle
into my fine lines and wrinkles
sometimes and I do have combo to oily
skin so I can only imagine how much it
would you know settle into certain fine
lines and wrinkles if you do have like
more mature skin or dry skin so I would
really only get this if you have just
like a normal skin or combo skin or oily
skin but it's beautiful and I really
love this color alright so the next one
we are going to be talking about is from
Clinique this is the Clinique chubby
stick in the shade is 0-1 hefty
highlight this is really really nice if
you do have dry skin or aging skin
because it is a cream product so it's
not going to overly emphasize any sort
of areas on your face and that tend to
be you know a little textured or just
you know dry areas in general so this is
what it actually looks like on the back
of the hand it has a beautiful white
base with like a light pink color to it
it is very very very blendable and very
pretty on the skin I really really like
this highlight a lot and although it
doesn't look like it's completely pink
there definitely is a little bit of a
pink iridescent going on there and it's
really really exciting so there is the
hefty highlight the next one we are
going to be talking about is from urban
decay and this is part of their new like
highlighter collection that they
recently released this is the urban
decay afterglow 8-hour powder
highlighter in the shade aura it comes
in this gorgeous like mirrored packaging
and this is what aura looks like it's
stunning like it's absolutely stunning
it's got a little bit of a cool toned
pink thing going on and I just love this
I think this is really beautiful again
if you have combo or normal or oily skin
I think you're gonna like this the most
because I do notice I have a little bit
of texture to it
and it does start to settle into fine
lines and wrinkles around my eye area
and also run this area if anything
travels lower it does start to get a
little uh a little much for my skin I
guess you could say it doesn't have like
that base gel a formulation where it
just glides over on top of the skin it
really can start to kind of settle into
certain areas so that's something to be
aware of but this is a gorgeous gorgeous
highlight as you can see it has that
kind of creamy pearly thing going on
with a beautiful pink iridescent so that
one is really beautiful as well the next
one again is from the drugstore this is
the L'Oreal True Match Lumi powder Glo
illuminator in the shade and 2:02 rose
this is what it looks like I'm sorry
Rosie
no it's rose so this is what it looks
like you have four different colors here
and it gives that really pinky vibe
because of this little section up here
that has that really rosy color when you
swatch it all together it looks sort of
more like on the white side but when you
actually have it on at the face there's
like a little
bit of almost a I don't know there's
almost like a duochrome thing going on
where you know in one light it looks
like it's white and then the other light
it looks like it's pink so it's really
really beautiful I love the way that
this sits on the skin I do notice that I
mean I wasn't the biggest fan of these
when I first started using them I got
the shade ice and then I got the shade
Rose it's not my favorite formulation
but it definitely is a good formulation
and in my opinion this formulation is
better than the one from wet and wild so
I feel like this would work for all
sorts of different skin tones and also
different skin types
I think this would show up really really
icy on you if you have a very very dark
complexion but I do think that this sits
very nicely on the skin so it can be
used for all sorts of different skin
types all right the next one I want to
talk about is from Dior this is the Dior
skin nude air glowing gardens powder of
the manator in the shade zero zero one
glowing pink this is what it looks like
it's got again at that gorgeous pearly
thing going on with the pink iridescent
this is stunning it's amazing this would
work on every single skin type and every
single skin tone in my opinion if you
are looking for a really nice kind of
pinky iridescent highlighter I would
HIGHLY highly recommend this one I don't
know if they will be bringing it back I
have heard that they might bring this
back for the summer 2016 holiday
collection so that's really really
exciting because these were limited
edition there was a nude one and then
there was this pink one and they are
just so incredibly beautiful I wish I
would have gotten my hands on the nude
one as well it's just a really really
beautiful highlight and like I said I
really do feel like that would work on
all sorts of different skin tones and
skin types it just has that baked Shola
formulation to it so really glides on
beautifully I love it alright the next
one is a cream this is going to be
really nice on all sorts of different
skin tones and if you have dry skin or
mature skin you're going to love this
you can mix this in with your foundation
or you can just wear it as a highlight
it is the NARS Copacabana illuminator in
the shade oh I said Copacabana you know
what I just realized there is one that I
am missing I wanted to bring the hard
candy doll face out that's another
gorgeous gorgeous pink illuminator and
it comes in a cream formulation just
like this one this one has more of a
white base with pink reflex going on
however the
from hard candy I swear is pretty much
like a dupe it is so beautiful on the
skin and it definitely has more of a
pink tone so I highly recommend checking
that one out before you check out this
particular one Copacabana but this one
is also really really beautiful and it
is a little nicer if you do have very
very fair skin like I do just because I
feel like it does have that white base
going on so it never looks too dark or
too pink so I like that one a lot the
next one that I want to talk about again
is from wet and wild this is the Wet n
Wild mega glow illuminating palette in
the shade 320 catwalk pink they have two
different formulations of this the old
version and the new version the new
version in my opinion definitely has
more pink reflex going on this is more
of a blush popper for me but it
definitely gives off like a pink vibe
and I think it's very very pretty it
gives more of like a darker pink almost
peachy color to it and it just kind of
depends on where you put your brush into
the actual palette if you want light
pink you go over to this area if you
want kind of like that darker pink color
you swirl them all together and then if
you want more bronzy shades you go over
here but overall I think it's really
beautiful and this would look absolutely
stunning on anybody who has a very dark
complexion I think this would make an
absolutely beautiful beautiful peachy
pink highlight on your skin tone and I
really like the way that this sits on
top of the skin it's it's a lot better
than the Fergie collection one in my
opinion and I just think it gives a lot
of glimmer and Sheen it does have chunks
of glitter in it but it's nothing too
noticeable you guys it's not anything
that you're gonna be like oh this is
just like disturbing products you know
on my face I don't like it it's still
really beautiful alright the next one is
the and the extra lighting powder from
hourglass in the shade incandescent
light it is a beautiful light pink and
this is what the highlight looks like
this is absolutely stunning it's got an
amazing amazing formula if you want a
highlight that's there but not like -
there is one that you really can build
up but it can be like a very soft glow
on the skin or you can build it up into
a wham-bam highlight you definitely need
this one it's beautiful you can see it's
like a matte pastel like pink color I
think this is absolutely stunning on the
skin I think any sort of skin tone and
skin type could use this to be
completely honest I think this will show
up on the deepest of skin tones on the
latest
tones on me it's still a highlight and
it's beautiful and for reference I'm
anywhere between an NC 10 and 15 when
I'm not soft hand and when I am soft and
I'm about an NC 20 which right now I'm
about an NC 20 probably can't tell but I
am but this is absolutely stunning and
gorgeous they ask to have a shade that I
love that I showed in the champagne
video which is called brilliant that's
beautiful as well this is just one that
I would recommend for everyone to try
out and if you are not interested in
that shade just check out the
formulation of the strobing powders the
next one is from Physicians Formula and
this is the powder palette in the
mineral glow pearls in the translucent
pearl version it's got a little bit of
like a pearly color some rosy tones in
there and then also some pink tones as
well as maybe some I don't know I would
call them kind of golden tones but I
find when I wear this especially on my
fair skin it gives off a very very pinky
look to the skin I really like this one
a lot if you swatch this one and the wet
and wild one the Fergie collection if
you swatch these together they look very
very similar the Physicians Formula one
is a lot like a lot more expensive in my
opinion I think it's around what 11 to
15 dollars depending on if you have a
coupon so I personally think that you
should go for the Fergie one but this
one has pretty much the identical same
color with that white base and the pink
reflex going on it's really beautiful
I do think this one sits on the skin a
little better and would work for all
sorts of different skin types I do think
it would look a little more pearl like
and very lik white on the skin if you do
have very deep dark um like if you have
a very dark complexion but for the most
part I think if you have a cool
undertone and you do have fair skin you
should check that out for sure and the
last one I want to talk about is the
laura geller baked gelato swirl
illuminator in the shade charming pink
this is a beautiful beautiful baked
shalay formulation this is what it looks
like very similar to the Dior and
glowing garden so I was gonna say nude
air it is nude air right yeah new hair
glowing gardens it's got a really nice
kind of cool toned pink shade you know
it's like a cool tone pink color
basically and it looks beautiful it
glides onto the skin absolutely
amazingly it would work for all sorts of
different skin types and also skin tones
I love the way it goes on look at that
high shine impact
it's just absolutely fabulous so I'm
going to keep that on my hands because
I'm gonna tell you guys which three are
my favorites and this one is one of my
favorites I just love the formulation of
this I love the color it's really
beautiful on my cool toned fair skin and
the second one that I have to talk about
is the ambient strobing a lighting
powder from hourglass I love the
formulation on these ambient strobing
lighting powders and this is definitely
my second favorite so I'll go ahead and
swatch that next to the laura geller so
there is the laura geller charming pink
here is the hourglass which has more of
like a matte pink satin going on and
then the last one that I want to talk
about should come as no surprise I am
obsessed with VG or glowing gardens in
glowing pink this is amazing this is
kind of what started the whole like my
obsession with just finding and
collecting pink highlighters so I love
this a lot and this is definitely my
third favorite so here are the three of
them squashed together we have Laura
Geller on the top which definitely has
the most pinky tones to it quill toned
pink here we have the hourglass which
has more of like a matte peachy thing
going on but it's still pretty pink and
then we have glowing gardens on the
bottom which has more of a pearl finish
with pink reflex so those are my top
three pink highlighters I hope you guys
enjoyed this video let me know if I left
any out besides the hard candy doll face
one I feel like I pretty much included
all of them but let me know if I left
one out that you have seen in my
collection before thank you so much for
joining me guys and I will see you for
my next battle or showdown video that
will be on contouring and bronzing
