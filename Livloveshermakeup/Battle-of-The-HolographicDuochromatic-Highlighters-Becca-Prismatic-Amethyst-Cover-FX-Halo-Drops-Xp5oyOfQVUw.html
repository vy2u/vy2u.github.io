and welcome back to the holographic so I
should do a chromatic battle video I
have been waiting to film this for quite
some time now we are going to be going
ahead and doing a battle of the dual
chromatic or holographic highlighters we
are going to be talking about the Becca
shimmering skin perfecter press in the
shade prismatic amethyst as well as the
Kat Von D Alchemist holographic palette
we're also going to be talking about -
the cover FX custom enhancer drops in
the shade halo and of course the
anastacio Beverly Hills a moon child and
glow kit now I do have the moon tail
block it on as my highlight today and
the shade that I am wearing is called a
pink art which is this one right here I
did apply that lightly with a fan brush
so all the products I mentioned in this
video and all the brands are cruelty
free so let's go ahead and jump right
into it we're gonna start with the
newest release this is the Becca
shimmering skin Perfector press in
prismatic amethyst it is a limited
edition and you can purchase it on the
Sephora comm website it does retail for
$38 and you do get seven grams of
product in here it is a little powdery
but not as bad as some of their other
you know like shimmering skin perfecter
press in my opinion now when you do get
them more like embossed texture here
like this one and rose quartz you are
getting a 1 gram less of product and
then this smooth texture I don't know
why they do that I guess it's just cuz
it looks pretty and they know people
will buy it but this has absolutely
gorgeous packaging and they do describe
this as a lavender and duochrome so it's
got a little bit of like a white base
and then also has some pink and lavender
shift to it if you are someone who is
just getting into holographic or do a
chromatic kind of highlights and you
don't want to have like straight-up
purple on your cheeks then I think this
would be a really really good product
for you now I did try it out on my
friend Senora who has a very deep
complexion and she was like yeah take it
off go get rose quartz for me it looks
very a she on her so I don't think that
the actual shift will pick up on every
single skin tone I did not see the
lavender shift on her or the pink but on
me as you guys can see you definitely
can kind of see it now I am self tanned
right now but when I met my latest I'm
what an NC NW 10 so I am pretty darn
fair and I think this is amazing because
the white base in there is not too dark
for the skin so if that goes rose quartz
was too dark for your skin and this one
it will not be it is very very similar
the base color to like Becca's pearl if
that makes sense so I really do like
this I think it's beautiful again if you
want to try out something do a chromatic
and you don't want something that's
going to
super super visible like green or purple
on your cheeks I think this is beautiful
I would recommend using these with a
very very fluffy brush I do notice if I
apply too much I definitely start to get
texture around my cheek area and like
this area you know fine lines wrinkles
so yeah I'd like to apply it with my
what is it luck see a tapered
highlighter brush alright moving on the
next item I want to talk about is the
Kat Von D Alchemist holographic palette
I love this packaging this does retail
for $32 on me Sephora calm website it is
the sephora exclusive and it is possibly
limited edition so when i first bought
this it was limited edition I will go
ahead good Nick I will go ahead and
throw out my review in the cards for you
guys I did a side-by-side swatches in
comparison with the anasazi of Beverly
Hills
moon child glow kit so I'll go ahead and
throw that up and yeah basically in here
you are getting for a different
holographic highlighters now this right
here as you guys can see is a little
mirror which i think is awesome because
of the Anasazi or Beverly Hills does not
have one but this is what it looks like
and actually I'm not going to call these
actual highlighters they're just
holographic goodness you get one point
five three grams in each pan which is a
rather small amount for $32 however
these are made to be used on the face on
the lips on the eyes you can use it
everywhere a lot of these other
highlighters I'm talking about are meant
for highlighting so the fact that you
can use this everywhere it's kind of
special it does have a little more of a
gritty formula to it so if you do have
very very dry skin aging skin or maybe
skin that is just very very textured
this might not be the best but it will
look gorgeous on your eyes so the first
shade we have here is called blue
sapphire this one right here is ultra
violet here we have it pink opal which
is very similar to the shade that I'm
wearing from the Anastacio Beverly Hills
palette today and finally we have a
green emerald so let me go ahead and
swatch those for you guys and like I
said it they just take a little more
work and it's mostly just because they
are found a little more thick I don't
know how to describe it it's just like
you can feel that it's a highlighter but
also an eye shadow in one so there are
all of the shades they are super super
beautiful although they don't look like
much in the pan as you can see they look
completely different and they do
transform when you get them on to the
skin you can even apply a like a black
base I heard and then put these on and
it will completely change the color of
like what the black base was and then
also I heard these glow in the dark and
I don't know if that's true or not but
I'm gonna have to tell
that out so yeah I would definitely
recommend this if you're someone who
wants to wear holographic things on your
lips on your eyes if you want it all
over your face I would recommend this
like the Anasazi of Beverly Hills the
Becca you know the cover FX those are
not really meant to be anywhere else
except for either mixing it to your
foundation or like on you know for
highlighting your face so I wouldn't
necessarily use them around the eyes I
do get a little irritated one and use
the Anasazi a Beverly Hills glow kit
around my eyes so yeah I would recommend
this one you know if you can justify the
price it is a very very small amount of
product in here but if you can justify
the price and you want something that
you can use everywhere I would get this
all right the next item I want to talk
about is the cover FX custom enhancer
drops in new shade halo so this is what
they look like and basically these are
$42 for 15ml which is kind of a small
amount but a little goes a very very
long way these are so intense and
beautiful I have never actually tried
before this I had never tried out the
custom enhancer drops before but they
are a liquid of formula as you guys can
see and this is a very very trippy kind
of color so it comes out and it looks
like whitish you have a little bit of
green a little bit of purple and then
watch this
whoa baby yeah I do like mixing this
into foundations I used it the other day
and usually I use it with the Armani
luminous silk foundation which is a
little too yellow tone for me because
this has such a strong blue and purple
shift to it I feel like it cools down
foundations but it also can make you
look a little like metallus sized on
your skin so make sure to only apply
like one or two drops but these are very
intense if you want to glow like a
unicorn you definitely could go ahead
and apply these with a damp sponge over
your foundation and be like yes yes you
know this is like the gods are like yes
a unicorn but you know if you are
someone who wants something more subtle
this is obviously not going to be for
you I do find that they're just super
super pigmented and like what I mix them
into my foundation I can kind of sheer
it out a little bit but it's like you
can still kind of see that overall
purple trance on my face and I like that
but if you are not into that you're not
gonna like this it's not what I would
consider a natural like holographic kind
of high
I feel like none of them really are but
this one is definitely going to be the
most noticeable if that makes sense now
you could go ahead and literally just
take like whatever is on the outside of
the dropper and mix that into your
foundation but I don't know if you're
gonna notice that much of a difference
like you want a little bit of a sheen
you know so yeah I think overall these
are good they do have like a Dometic own
formula obviously they don't have any
sort of like glitter or like particles
and then you know they don't have any
sort of patchiness or dryness because
they're not a powder they do have a very
very silicone like slip to them so if
you have more like mature skin or aging
skin and you really want to try
something out that has like a really
really strong holographic effect I think
this is awesome you do pick up a bunch
of different colors when you do kind of
twist your hand but mostly I see purple
and also abolutely so yeah I really do
you like those and finally we are going
to talk about the anasazi of Beverly
Hills and moonchild below kit this is
what it looks like it is exclusive to
the Anasazi of Beverly Hills a.com
website you do get six of different
highlighters in here you do not get a
mirror like I said but that's okay and
this is permanent now which is awesome
so this is my all-time favorite glow
Kate you guys and out of all the
products I'm gonna recommend I would
recommend this one I think that you get
the most bang for your buck in here and
you really can try to use them as
eyeshadows they don't work as well as
the Kat Von D okay I kind of like to
keep this around for I shadow 's these
two guys right here these darker shades
purple horseshoe and also blue moon I
have a little bit of like chunkiness to
them and I find I really have to like
foil them to get them on like my lower
lash liner to even really show up on my
eyes but you can layer them if you do
have a very very light complexion you
can go ahead and put these on and then
layer a lighter shade on top and I think
it is really a really a beautiful this
is just an amazing cloak it I feel like
you're getting everything in here you're
getting so many different shades you're
getting a let's eat your green shift
you're getting a silver shift you're
getting a blue shift and also a pink
shift and like I said I'm wearing pink
heart today and it's actually very
natural and very beautiful and glowy so
I would recommend this that this is just
the one hands-down that I would
recommend for you guys no matter what
skin type you have no matter how old you
are how young you are I think this is
going to be the one that you want to try
out to get the most product most bang
for your buck basically and you just get
a lot of different shades so let's go
ahead Anna so much these babies shall we
so here we have purple horseshoe
and like I said that one tends to be a
little on the chunky side then we have
the sheet a star then we do have this
baby and Lucky Clover so there they are
I feel like I'm like a unicorn right now
like look at my hand it's so shimmery so
there are the first of four on the top
but we do have these shade it let's see
here Lucky Clover then we have star and
then we do have blue moon and purple
horseshoe and then a blue ice and pink
heart are really beautiful as well I
thought I was gonna love blue ice the
most but this one's actually quite
chunky it don't have like a blue
undertone which is nice but I really
love pink heart so here is pink heart so
there they are these are getting a
little chunky right now I don't know I
feel like the longer that this does sit
around in my collection the more I
notice it he's getting a little tougher
to use so I did want to go ahead and
just point that out but it used to be
super super creamy and buttery but I
feel like it goes onto the skin
beautifully still so anyway those are
the swatches of the honest hacia Beverly
Hills and moonchild located that is what
I would recommend if you want to get
into the holographic duo chromatic kind
of trend I think then they are awesome
for you know using you can use them
delicately around your eye area and you
can use them on your face and try out
different kind of highlighter look so
anyway that is it guys um like I said
who wins for me Anasazi of Beverly Hills
I think if you're someone who wants a
very very natural duochrome kind of
highlight I would go with the Becca if
you do have more like aging skin and you
don't want anything with shimmer
particles or anything like that I would
go with the cover effects and especially
if you do have dry skin as well and then
also I would say if you want lip product
you want face products you want I
products I would go with the Kat Von D
Alchemist but if you just overall want
to try out some duochrome a holographic
goodness I'd go with the Anastacio so
anyway that is it thank you so much for
joining me guys then I'll see you
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
