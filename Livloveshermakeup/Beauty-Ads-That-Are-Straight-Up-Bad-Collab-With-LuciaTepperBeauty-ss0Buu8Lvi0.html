my channel today's video is going to be
all about beauty ads that are
straight-up bad now I know I have talked
about some controversial posts that the
beauty brands have made in the past as
well as talked about just a gimmicky
brands in general I will go ahead and
throw out those videos up in the cards
but today I'm super excited because this
is a collab with my friend Lucia here on
YouTube Lucia is awesome she has a
little firecracker you guys I
love her if you enjoyed my content I
absolutely a hundred percent know you
are going to love her make up your mind
series I'm gonna go ahead and throw that
series up in the card so you guys can
start binge watching and then I'm gonna
link Lucci of Instagram as well as her
channel as well as her video down below
I would love if you guys went over and
showed her some love she's going to be
talking about beauty ads that are
straight-up bad talking a little more
about like FOMO and fear of missing out
whereas I'm just gonna be talking about
some yeah okay so let's go
ahead and jump right into the video I
want to start with the Benefit Cosmetics
benefit has some of the craziest ads in
my opinion I understand that they're
kind of supposed to be any joking matter
but to me these really don't reflect
well on the beauty community nor do they
reflect well on a young girl so anyway
the first one we have here is Benefit
Cosmetics claiming their Porefessional
primer is going to clear your vision
right up alright we have a little ad
here and you can see the pore fessional
and on the right hand side you see a
girl with glasses on or hair up in a
ponytail and it says yeah okay she
clearly doesn't have this goddamn primer
I see what they were trying to do here
but this is just problematic
look at this yuck and wow that's right
ladies if you wear glasses you are
disgusting
you need to go ahead and pick up this
court fashion all so you can slather it
on your face and feel better about
yourself and so you could be why would
seven Yaak are you fit are you for real
alright moving on to the second one here
skip class not concealer boys and girls
that's right it is more important that
you go ahead and you cover up those dark
blues underneath your eyes which he will
perpetually have all four years of
college as well as your blemishes
because concealer is way more important
than education I don't understand what
their PR team was thinking now I believe
that they did go ahead and they remove
this ad which is very very smart but
again it just comes back
like what is your age demographic
because I remember when I was working at
Sephora before or five years ago when I
was in college I was purchasing a
benefit products because I wasn't
cruelty-free yet and I did like a lot of
their products I loved their their real
mascara I really like some of their face
products I mean I for real was into the
brand so I'm really wondering what the
PR team was thinking because I am
definitely sure that there are
college-age people that are seeing these
ads and thinking like what the and
you know subconsciously that will get
into your head okay and not every single
person has time to slather makeup on
their face in the morning especially
when you're in college I remember when I
was in college I went to school half the
time with no makeup you don't have time
it's not about skipping class not
concealer it's about skipping concealer
not class all right Lily we have another
yuk and Wow benefit making everybody
feel real good about themselves
including me in this fun this is a
picture of a girl highly edited at the
beginning as well as the photos so you
can see she's got maybe a little bit of
brow product on clearly all airbrushed
around her eye her skin area and then as
she has a little bit of mascara on and
then you see her in the Wow photo and
she suddenly has a big thick winged
liner on and she's wow now because you
guys have to know that when you put
liquid liner on that is the wow factor
you unless you have some liquid liner on
so obviously benefit knows exactly what
they're doing here they're
genius if you can't do a winged liner
then girl you are not cute you're not
cute including me all right up next we
have an ad that I have spoken about
before in a previous video this is the
urban decay of a razor sharp swatches
and this is for the urban decay all
nighter a liquid eyeliner now you guys
can see the ad right here now think
about it a little bit they say ready for
some razor sharp swatches Urban Decay
ORS hashtag Urban Decay all nighter you
can see all the different colors of the
liquid liner and then you see the
swatches the swatches are incredibly
thin and small obviously these are
liquid eyeliners so I can understand why
those swatches are thin and small but a
lot of people thought that they were
glorifying a self harm or a people
cutting themselves and I feel like this
was a mistake on Urban Decay's a part
they did take this photo down and they
did apologize and they did
talk about how they didn't see it that
way they didn't mean it that way and
were some people that were saying that
Urban Decay's PR team did this on
purpose I personally don't think they
did there are beauty brands out there
that will use anything to get a little
controversy so that they can sell more
product light so that they can have more
attention this is a tactic that a lot of
beauty brands are doing recently and I
think it's kind of gross but I
personally didn't want to think the
urban decay would do this but yeah this
is definitely a bad beauty ad in my
opinion do it on purpose
I don't really know I would like to
think they didn't I do give them full
credit because they took it down
immediately and they did apologize but I
yeah I thought it was worth a mention
all right up next we have a vintage
beauty ad which shows that it's not just
this day and age that there's some
really outrageous ads going on this is
one from I believe the 70s for the tangi
or Thanh Zhi a bright and clear lipstick
so there are a lot of things that are
interesting about this particular ad
most of all looking like this girl bout
to go down on that lipstick okay
it says the latest jewel of all can be
on your lips
Tanja's newest lipstick shade a bright
and clear is the brightest clearest most
dazzling read on a record it is exactly
the color and lipstick America's leading
a beauty authorities say smart women
should wear and exciting a miracle here
in an incredible type of lipstick that
actually stays bright and clear for
hours and hours it will not dry out your
lips will not go dull and lifeless even
after a blotting so start your bright
and clear future today what a weird name
for a lipstick bright and clear it also
says that smart women are going to be
wearing it and I understand this this ad
was from you know the 60s or 70s so I
get that there was a lot of walking all
over women which I do not agree with but
this is just strange I mean they could
have literally put the picture of her
face over on the side it looks like
she's about to go down on it looks like
she popped a sucka dick like I'm sorry
it's just really really strange
placement and a very very straight ad in
my opinion I know back in the day they
used to use women a lot of sexual
representation of certain beauty
products if you wore makeup you were
beautiful and again I think that benefit
was trying to kind of leech off of that
like Oh yuck and Wow you know kind of
plain a little bit of how women who used
to be treated back in the day but I
don't think
something that really is great and I
don't think it's funny at all in any way
shape or form even when I was younger I
wouldn't think it's funny and now I
certainly don't think it's funny
it is a new age we don't need to have
abs like this anymore and even for
benefit just to kind of lately play off
of ads like this from back in the day I
still don't think it's great I still
don't think it's good so those are some
beauty ads that in my personal opinion
are straight-up bad whether the brand is
doing it on purpose and trying to kind
of play against a little bit of
controversy like benefit or whether they
felt like they actually made a mistake
like urban decay I still think they're a
little inappropriate and they're not
beauty as they get me excited about
their products in any way shape or form
so let me know down below if you have
any beauty ads you would like to add to
this particular list what sort of beauty
ads that you have seen in magazines or
as commercials or an Instagram really
rub you the wrong way and you think are
inappropriate I would love to know down
below make sure to please go send lucio
some love I think you guys are really
going to enjoy our channel and I yeah
that's pretty much it for today I guess
I will see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
