thank you for joining me today I'm doing
an unboxing for the beauty box 5
unboxing which I thought I had cancelled
I have been really disappointed with the
boxes that I've gotten probably the past
five months however i went online and i
thought i had closed out my box and it
turns out i haven't so i'm going to see
what's in this box and if it is better i
will continue if it's not that obviously
i will not continue but we will see i
guess what's in at this box this is for
the month of May so let's just get
started I see a few little cards in here
um you get an experience essenza which
looks like a hand soap and that's just a
little discount code i'll set the stylee
style the ultimate beauty store enjoy
twenty five percent off your entire
order and you can use the coupon code
bb5 june right there um next I see this
little win five full-size versions of
this month products share the love on
instagram so those are the little rules
you guys want a screenshot that I don't
have a Instagram yet I don't have to get
one but you guys can definitely enter
that if you want to and then of course
they have the card that shows everything
that's in the book store this month so
like I said I've just been really
disappointed with the beauty box five
lately I thought blood or said that I
had stopped my order but apparently I
haven't so I guess we'll see what's in
this box if it is better than maybe I'll
continue if it's not that I'm definitely
cancelling so anyway let's get started
the first thing I see in here is the
bios twist a hundred percent stainless
steel slant had many tweezers so those
are actually really cute and I think
those would be helpful to have like in
your purse or when you're traveling on
the little card it says the bios with
stainless steel mini tweezers they
retail for 499 it says these little life
savers are sharp and precise and their
travel to prevents dirt and dulling
making them making them perfect to toss
into your purse or make up a for
on-the-go brow fixes so I can definitely
use that that's not very disappointing
product i'm pretty happy about that
next thing I seen here is the Essenza
luxury hand soap and that's what looked
like this little park was for this is in
rosemary mint and it says it has pure
essential oils in it you guys know I
love me some hand soap particularly the
ones from bed bath bed bath and beyond
bath and body works so I will definitely
try this out and see how goes on the
card it says sent a luxury hand soap
retail is 499 for 16.9 fluid ounces so
you get a huge thing of this for only
five dollars and this is two fluid
ounces by the way it says who said
washing your hands can't be luxurious
the invigorating scent of this new fave
comes from pure essential oils and it
moisturizes deeply wild cleansing okay
so that's okay so far the stocks is
better than other ones i have tried the
next thing I see in here is the active
moist dermalogica recommended for skin
with excess oil production a lightweight
lotion for daily moisture protection
contains no artificial fragrance or
color it looks like this I've tried a
few of the dermalogica products and I
have liked them so we'll see how this
one goes and on the little card it says
dermalogica active moist it retails for
60 dollars for 3.4 fluid ounces it says
oil 3 how dehydration is here this
moisturizer comes to the rescue with
silk amino acids to even else can text
your all day long so um that's okay like
I'm you know I'm happy with trying new
skincare products the next thing I see
looks like a glide on blush stick and
this is from steinway style and the
color is in a bittersweet let me take
the packaging options I see looks like
that I like this it's nice so that is
the color you get looks very very kind
of bronzy and deep oh very nice very
very pigmented can you guys see that so
here it seems to glide on pretty well
and it's actually interesting kind of
color it looks more like fall but um it
smells really good and I'm excited to
try it I mean I'm all for cream blushes
during the summer when you don't want
something so heavy on your skin so we'll
see about that one
does say that this is the style a style
blush / highlighter stick well I'm not
say any highlights or shimmering well I
just say some shimmer but it doesn't
look like it's very highlighting it just
looks like a blush stick to me um it
says hello color these little cuties
pack a sweet punch of pigment and
shimmer for your cheeks and are easily
buildable for your own custom coverage
assorted colors and the retail for point
21 fluid ounces which this one is this
is the full size is a 599 so that's
pretty good so I am excited about that
that should be good and you last thing
you get you can another thing that's
great I feel like they sent more in this
box than usual so let's see what this is
this looks like a little brush oh it's
in coastal scents and I do like the
Coastal Scents brushes so this is from
Coastal Scents it's a BRC so8 brush and
it looks like it can just be nice like
I'm in the crease really really nice
it's pretty thick very nice and on the
car let's get it out it says Coastal
Scents plastic / classic / synthetic
brush it retails is 195 through 249 give
a girl the right brush and she can
conquer the world or at least her eye
shadows at these super soft pics to your
beauty arsenal so yeah so that's pretty
exciting um I thought this was actually
good box so I'm going to go ahead and
keep it for another month and see if
they send me some even better products
um but overall this seems like a pretty
good box so I will link below if you
