my channel today I am walking you guys
through a list of brands that I was
incredibly incredibly loyal to in 2017
before we get into this I do want to say
um I'm peeling all over my nose right
now so if you see a little tiny
white bitch you know what it is it's my
skin okay but anyway yeah let's go ahead
and jump right into it tomorrow we're
gonna talk about some brands that were
not so professional in 2017 but these
were brands I feel like I maintained a
very nice professional feel and overall
I was very loyal to them I kept
purchasing over and over and over again
so the first brand I want to talk about
is Becca cosmetics I feel like the only
little bump in the road that they had
this year was when they kind of pulled
the carpet out or pulled the rug out
from the champagne collection
collaboration with Jaclyn hill but I
feel like the two of them maintained a
really nice professional sort of
relationship on social media there was
no throwing people under the bus when
that happened and I feel like overall
their products that they released this
year we're pretty damn good a few of
their eyeshadow palettes were a little
bit of a Miss they don't release
eyeshadow palettes all that often but
their face palettes and also their
shimmering skin perfecter press in the
limited-edition forms like lilac geode
and prismatic amethyst were fantastic
the one thing I would like to see a
Becca do in the future is kind of slow
down a little bit on the limited edition
stuff especially when we already know
that you're gonna make those limited
edition things you know permanent in the
future just a call a permanent
okay that's all I wanna know if I want
to hear and then right here we have the
lake chaser highlighters which again
were a really really great find for the
year so what the first friend that I was
very loyal to this year was Becca
cosmetics all right as far as drugstore
brands are concerned I feel like the one
brand that I was very very loyal to this
year was definitely wet and wild I love
pretty much everything that they release
I feel like there are only a few things
that really kind of strike me the wrong
way but when it comes to the drugstore
cruelty free and vegan and makeup it's
always wet and wild and I reach for a
lot of their products are vegan they're
obviously a cruelty free drugstore brand
and they're really really reasonably
priced so I did enjoy at their little
midnight mermaid collection I love their
highlighter as well as the liquid
lipsticks these are the metallic form
now a lot of people did not like these
but I personally do I find them very
comfortable
so the left and the flutist okay and I
have very dry lips oh when I find a
liquid lipstick formula that I like I
stick to it and then of course you guys
know the wet and wild atmega glow
highlighters became one of my all-time
favorite formulas of the year and these
are a Baker gelee a sort of drugstore
highlight so if you want that gorgeous
high shine impact for 399 or $4.99 would
highly recommend you guys look into
those another really affordable brand
that really caught my attention this
year especially the last six months is
color pop when they would have had it
and release a deep powder formula for
their blushes and their bronzers and
their highlighting palettes and their
eyeshadows I was a little skeptical I
was not a diehard fan of color pop the
only products that I really liked from
them before they went ahead and started
to do the powder formulas where their
lippie stix i love their lippie stix but
I never liked their super super shocks
super shock shadows I never liked the
little squishy highlighters or squishy
bronzers they're squishy blushes all of
those products got out of my collection
I decluttered them so I really was only
a fan of the lippie Stix and then they
started to go ahead and release some of
these palettes and I instantly fell in
love I feel like a lot of you can feel
the same way right here but I mean these
are some really great eye shadows
especially for the price the one thing I
will say is I think that right now
they're releasing a little too much I
feel like they're gonna go from a very
exciting brand to a very bland brand if
they don't slow down because how many
different collaborations can you do in
one year how many different color
combinations can you do in one year I
would love if they took a step back and
just kind of released a new palette
maybe every three months I think that
would be amazing for the new year but I
will say colour-pop definitely impressed
me in 2017 another brand that has been
impressing me is hourglass hourglass is
so classy and luxury and they actually
have come out and made a statement
saying that they plan to be completely
vegan all cruelty-free vegan products by
20 what was it 20 20 and is that so cool
I think that's awesome
I really respect hourglass I feel like
they never ever ever have any drama
surrounding them I like that they're
very low-key they're very professional
and they give you that really luxurious
feel and if you are a cruelty-free
beauty blogger beauty vlogger somebody
who is looking for luxury makeup and you
walk into Sephora and you're looking for
luxury makeup that's cruelty free if
you're like hourglass is the first brand
then
so four employees will point out for you
because a lot of leverage reprints are
not actually cruelty free but you guys
know I love their hourglass ambient
lighting powders at this year's holiday
palette was also pretty darn good the
one thing I will say is I'm noticing
they're starting to add a little bit of
glitter into some of their ambulating
powders and I would like them to go
ahead and slow down with that that is
not you an hourglass okay you are way
too classy to be adding chunks of
glitter into your product it's just not
what I want for the formula but of
course they can do whatever the hell
they want but yeah they always give me a
great feel I love their products I have
been using them for a year so absolutely
hourglass has to be on this list moving
right along to Anastacio Beverly Hills I
know there was some drama surrounding
this brand this year I totally
understand I know the subculture debacle
as well as how noir vina handled things
with a little bit on the unprofessional
side but I have to say they are a brand
that I was very very loyal to this year
I enjoy the majority of our Nastasia
Beverly Hills releases okay I never
really give anything like a two or one
star rating everything is three and
above and it's because they have some
good I also really enjoyed
that they have nice prices on their
makeup products so I do enjoy the prison
palette I do enjoy the subculture I know
a lot of people did not but you know
what these are good palettes I like what
the brand stands for I like the prices I
like what they're doing and I like that
they stay up-to-date with trends so yes
Anasazi of Beverly Hills may have not
been the most professional beauty brand
of the year but the salesman still
maintained a little bit of decency you
know what I'm saying like they have
they're not on this list by any
means and on top of that I really didn't
feel like I was very drawn to the brand
I bought a lot of new releases from them
and I've been very happy with them and
finally guys let's talk about a skincare
brand I think there is one skincare
brand that I have been most drawn to
this year it's definitely drunk elephant
and now it kind of goes between Sundy
Riley and drugged elephant but Sunday
Riley for me the Sierras had more misses
than hits I'm not a huge fan of their
tranquility a bloomin cleansing balm I
wasn't a fan of their ceramic slipper
clay cleanser but everything from drunk
elephant but I've been trying out
recently I've been very happy with this
specifically and especially these deeper
MIDI serum as well as the jelly cleanser
which is the cantaloupe jelly cleanser I
love that that has become my go-to
cleanser I absolutely adored for my
normal such a dry slash sensitive kind
of skin
and yeah they're just a brand that
really has a high professional quality
to them I never see them throwing shade
at Sunday Riley on Instagram you know
like some of these makeup brands do I
feel like skincare brands just kind of
hang low you know they don't have any
issues there's no kind of drama going on
and I really appreciate that so anyway
guys those are the brand side was loyal
to this year the brand so I thought
we're pretty darn it professional um let
me know down below what your list is and
I guess I will see you guys tomorrow we
will talk about some brands that we're
not so professional in 2017 bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
