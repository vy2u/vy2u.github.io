channel today's video is going to be all
about beauty brands that are currently
on my shit list
not like Atlas my shit list so these are
beauty brands that could technically be
approaching a boycot territory if I
don't notice a change within these
brands and I'm not quite sure I want to
support them anymore and this is my way
of having a video saying hey bitch I see
you okay so let's go ahead and jump
right into it I want to start with the
ordinary so the ordinary is owned up by
Dyson and the founder as well as the
former CEO Brandon actually had like a
little bit of what people are calling a
mental breakdown on social media the
past couple of months now it's not my
place to judge if somebody actually has
mental illness or not especially
considering he has not come out and said
that so I'm not going to touch on that
but I did want to walk you guys through
a little timeline of events on what kind
of happened and how it left a bad taste
in my mouth so on January 12th of 2018
Brandon made a chap and drunk elephant
which is a really really popular big
skincare brand right now saying you
would have to be drunk to overpay it for
marula oil and that was actually listed
on the Ordinaries website for like six
days and then then on January 24th
Brandon posted a video on Instagram
saying he would be canceling all of
Dyson's marketing plans he also stated
that he would start using the brand's
Instagram page as his own personal
Instagram page from now on and later on
he made remarks about his employees
calling them monkeys and then on the
29th he alerted everyone via Instagram
video that their account had been hacked
by either an employee or a competitor on
February 1st Brandon said he will be
taking the name a worker / CEO saying
that he's never liked any of his bosses
and he didn't want people to see him in
a negative light on February 6th he
actually made a public of firing um two
cosmetics a dr. T's on a show dating the
lip care brand under the Dyson umbrella
suffered from rushed formulas and that
almost everybody hated them he also said
I need to say goodbye to you because we
are too busy to love your brand enough
and after that whole incident went down
on February 9th diesem employees I think
there were three of them came forward
saying how drama-filled it was to be
working at the company in April he was
also accused of saying a racist thing
and on the 25th he posted a series of
strange Instagram videos calling for
help and posting call 911 section and
finally on April 27th Brandon posted a
video saying I am done with everything
and diesem just the whole series of
events was really really kind of
shocking I don't even think you can find
the ordinary on Sephora anymore I'm
pretty sure they pulled it down because
of this controversy and it just kind of
left a weird taste in my mouth
personally now they do have a new CEO as
far as I'm concerned and I look forward
to seeing what they release it next but
as of right now they are kind of on my
shit less cosmetics so it has occurred
to me that yes it is very very strange
for me to go ahead and boycott a brown
like Tarte cosmetics for coming out with
a shitty shade selection for their
foundations and then not boycott other
brands and that also have shitty shape
ranges now to be fair you guys don't
know everything that has gone on behind
the scenes
and I can't tell ya I really wish I
could and I really wish that there was a
way for me to make a video without
getting myself in trouble but as of
right now there isn't so I did want to
put that out there because I think a lot
of people get the wrong idea about me
smacking on to face and turn all the
time there are things that go on behind
the scenes you guys but I also do have
to protect myself now with that being
said it cosmetics really does need to
rethink their shade selection Jamie Kern
who is the owner as well as CEO of the
brand went on and made this huge speech
talking about how she wants everything
to be inclusive and you know she's gonna
be coming out with new shades of being a
cosmetics CC cream and then she released
the shades and there's maybe what five
or six deeper shades I feel like if I'm
looking at a CC cream yes it's a CC
cream and I understand that CC creams
blend into the skin a little better they
usually don't have a huge amount of
coverage so you know you don't have to
technically have it you know 45 shades
of them but at the same time you know
the in cosmetics CC cream in the
illumination as well as the regular
version actually do you have quite a bit
of coverage to them and even the
lightest shade for me and when I am NOT
self tan is still too dark so I think
they need to work on their shade
selection for their deeper shades as
well as their lighter shades and you
know what fuck it while you're at it go
ahead and put some more medium tone
shades in there as well because there's
what two or three I'm sorry Jamie but if
you do not get your shit together when
it comes to your shade selection I'm
just not gonna be purchasing from your
brand any more
I know that you really really put
quality ingredients into your makeup and
to be completely honest your skin care
there are still brands out there that
are much better as far as skin care is
concerned I love that you put all the
SPF in I love that you're trying to help
our skin and protect our skin but you
need to realize there are also people
that have deeper complexions as well as
lighter complexions that would love to
try out your products but they can they
fucking can so yeah it cosmetics is
currently on my shit less amazing
cosmetics and I know I just said there
are certain things that I can't talk
about that goes on behind the scenes
with certain beauty brands but I have
mentioned to you guys that I had a
little bit of difficulty when it comes
to amazing cosmetics I was on there PR
lists they booted me off their PR list
and then I ended up just being like okay
that's art that's fine anyway you know I
didn't want to fight with them because
let's be honest I don't think that
they're 100% cruelty free at least
logical harmony doesn't have them listed
that way I trust Tichina she does so
much good research and I didn't want to
go look in and digging into the brand
myself because I was already having some
issues with them about a week ago I get
another PR package from amazing
cosmetics that they sent me their new
eye primer and they wrote a little note
that was a little weird I won't say
exactly otherwise but it just kind of
felt a little backhanded a little bit of
like a slap in the face no I did speak
to one of the representatives and
apparently the girl that I had been
going back and forth with when I said
hey listen here's my review of your
product a couple of years ago and then
they booted me she was fired from her
job so that's fine but I also like I
said don't think that their cruelty free
status is as legitimate as they say and
I will be doing a video soon talking
about brands who are very very sneaky
when it comes to their cruelty free
style just think it's kind of weird to
send a beauty guru some products and it
keeps sending them products and then
suddenly you get one negative review you
take them off the goddamn PR list and
then there's a little bit of
back-and-forth you completely drop off
the face of the earth they somehow find
my new address and then they send me a
new product with a little bit of a
backhanded note if that threw me off and
because of that I wanted to go ahead and
include them in this video I know it's a
little salty but you know what fuck it
alright amazing cosmetics you're on my
shit list right now and finally
we have another brand that kind of is
reminding me a very reminiscent of like
it cosmetics but drugstore wise it's
Physicians Formula and now I also was
going to be adding Catrice cosmetics to
this list because I feel like a lot of
their stuff just really isn't inclusive
and I was really turned off however I
actually contacted them and they are
opening up their shade range on their
foundation like a huge amount which i
think is amazing so I'm very very
excited for that they don't have a ton
of products and I understand you know
loose setting powders and things like
that don't necessarily have to have
different tones to them but I for sure
know that like the essence all about
Matt fixing compact powder as well as
the Catrice cosmetics prime and fine
mattifying powder really don't work for
darker skin tones from what I've heard
essence is also coming out with a deeper
shade of the all about Matt which is
great so I like to see that I like to
see it video brand is actually taking
strides to go in the right direction
especially when they are a drugstore
brand but Physicians Formula has been
tricky a for a while now it's hard for
me to just say you know what I'm not
gonna purchase anything from Physicians
Formula but I know that I should it
I really shouldn't unless they can get
their stuff together and their bronzers
are probably what their best selling
product and you have two shades they're
so similar to one another once a little
more cool tone one's a little more warm
tone if you are a ghost if you are pasty
as fuck if you have a light skin tone
you're gonna love these bronzers I
constantly talk about them but I'm sorry
if you do have a medium complexion or a
deeper complexion honey these are not
gonna show up on you actually if you
have a deep complexion it will probably
show up incredibly actually you could
probably wear it as a highlight to be
completely honest and that is just a
goddamn shame when your best selling
product only has two different shades to
choose from now there are more more
butter blushes I feel like they released
some darker shades as well which was
really really nice but then you go and
you look at their foundation selection
and again kind of like it cosmetics they
need to work on their light shades they
also need to work on their dark shades
you can't just release three or four
different shades of foundation
especially if that foundation has been
out for what a year two three four
fucking five years come on now come on
now that that's a little
and that's a little sketch alright and
you know as much as I do enjoy the brand
and as much as I would like to continue
purchasing because their products do
work for me it's not fair for me to say
I'm gonna get it because it will work
for me I'm gonna go get that new butter
bronzer fucking little kit thing with
the perfume and the highlighter got that
looks great for my complexion I'm dying
I want it but I'm not gonna get it
because they should have released three
of those kids there should have been
multiple multiple different shades that
you're going to release when it comes to
your bronzers when it comes to your
blushes and especially when it comes to
your foundations and again they need to
work on the darker shades but lighter
shades to Physicians Formula is fucking
horrendous when it comes to lighter
shades that shit is orange like crazy so
anyway guys that is it for this video I
know that some of you are gonna ask down
below we'll live here's some more brands
that you use that really aren't good and
trust me when I tell you that I have
been contacting different brands asking
questions are you gonna be opening up
your shade range what's going on with
this what's going on with that so when I
have some more details for you I will go
ahead and I will update you guys but so
far these are the brands that I am going
to be a letting go of for now I'm not
going to be like decluttering the
products I have I love some my skincare
from the ordinary but let's just kind of
wait it out see how things go it
cosmetics Physicians Formula
you know I'm gonna give you what six
months if you can't get your shit
together by then then ya probably gonna
be boycotting you and then when it comes
to amazing cosmetics you're pretty much
already being boycotted and if you're
watching this right now which I'm sure
ear up is from amazing cosmetics please
take me off your PR list and also it's
creepy that you found my address and I
think give it to you just got to say
that so anyway guys that is it for
beauty brands that are currently on my
shit list so let me know down below if
you have any brands that you want to add
to this list that are on your list I'm
sorry let me know down below if you have
any brands that are currently on your
shit list and also let me know if you
have any brands that are on your hit
list I'm not like gonna hit you I mean
like hitless like well their hips
they're really good so anyway that is it
so thanks again for joining me guys and
I will see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
