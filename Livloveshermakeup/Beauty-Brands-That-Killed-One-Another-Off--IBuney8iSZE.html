happy Thursday today I have a fun video
for you guys let's talk about some
beauty brands that have obliterated one
another let's talk about some beauty
brands that have outdone each other over
the years I think a little healthy
competition is very very good there is
always somebody or someone or something
that is going to out to do you whether
you are a beauty vlogger or you are a
beauty a brand you always always should
know that there is always going to be
something better that's just how the
world works so I want to start with
three different brands that I feel like
really outdid each other
the first one is Mac I believe that
makeup geek basically killed off MAC
Cosmetics and I personally believe that
colour-pop killed off makeup geek so we
have Mac we have makeup geek and then we
have color pop back about five years ago
if you were watching a YouTube like I
was I personally wasn't creating content
five years ago but I was watching Beauty
Channel's every single person and their
goddamn mother - grandmother everybody
was talking about a MAC Cosmetics could
not find a single tutorial that didn't
use at least one a MAC eyeshadow as well
as their lipsticks were so incredibly
popular now fast-forward a couple of
years and makeup geek or marlane Estelle
here on YouTube decided to open up her
own brand makeup geek was basically the
same sort of quality products lipsticks
as well as eyeshadows specifically like
their little eyeshadow pans were much
cheaper but just as good of quality as a
mac cosmetics so that basically kind of
killed off the brand Marlena did some
really really great PR as well she
featured a lot of her different products
on different youtubers channels and I
feel like that really really took off
fast-forward about two years later and
color pop came out color pops started
with a lot of their super shock or cream
to powder products released their press
is super shock I shadows they are so
 good they're better than makeup
eat and they are better than mac
cosmetics in my opinion and that's when
I feel like they really really really
killed off makeup geek now makeup geek
is coming to Target which i think is
really going to resurrect the brand I am
very very excited for Marlena she has
some fabulous fabulous products but I
just feel like she hasn't been on top of
it as of recently I know she's been
going through some personal things in
her life and you know take care of that
stuff that's totally fine but I feel
like as a beauty brand you have to keep
up with what is going on and color pop
is on top of that so yeah I would
say the color pop is at the top of the
cheyna as of right now now let's go
ahead and move on it to Sigma who the
hell killed off Sigma nobody talks about
Sigma anymore well I will tell you who
killed off Sigma as much as I don't like
them morphe cosmetics killed off sigma
morphe cosmetics will give you a similar
sort of brushes as well as really good
blending brushes defining brushes all
that sort of stuff for a fraction of the
price of Sigma brushes I've said this
before I don't react well to makeup from
morphe I don't like their makeup
products I've done a whole different
video on it I will throw it up in the
cards but I will say they have some
cheap brushes that are pretty damn good
okay
they tend to be a little scratchy some
of them can be a little scratchy but
they blend your eyeshadow out like a
 dream just like how Sigma
brushes do however the difference is is
that Sigma brushes will last you a
lifetime I'm not even kidding I have a
35e forties that literally have lasted
ages 6 to 7 years which is incredible
but I would say five six years ago every
single brush that was being talked about
was Sigma every single person was a
Sigma affiliate and now obviously
everybody is pushing their morphe code
use code a booty guru for 15% off let's
move on to Coastal Scents in BH
Cosmetics BH Cosmetics totally
obliterated Coastal Scents in my opinion
do you guys remember Coastal Scents oh
god what was this maybe six seven
possibly eight years ago Coastal Scents
had these huge huge huge palettes and
they were basically like a rainbow color
you could get cool toned palettes warm
toned palettes sort of like a morph
annex and they were like $20 for a
palette with like 40 different
eyeshadows everybody was using them
because if you couldn't afford and that
cosmetics you would go for Coastal
Scents and a lot of people who are
watching these Beauty burrs wanted to go
ahead and purchase Coastal Scents
instead up a bunch of different Mac
singles so I will say I feel like
recently BH Cosmetics has totally come
back into the game ever since they
released their collaboration with Carli
bybel I feel as if a lot of people have
taken notice of BH Cosmetics again
there's zodiac palette and their new
palette which is like their festival
palette looks great it seems
like they have really really stepped up
their game as far as their formulations
are concerned so I'm really not
surprised that they obliterated Coastal
Scents but let me know down below
you were watching YouTube back in the
day when Coastal Scents was a thing
do you remember when everybody was
talking about Clarisonic I don't feel
like everybody's talking about
Clarisonic anymore because foreo is a
new thing biryeo has those little
silicon devices you can get the
sensitive version you can get the oily
combo version they have all sorts of
different ones that you can get I have
the little minis I really really do
enjoy my Ferriero however I will say
there's something very special about
Clarisonic and I always will have a
thing for Clarisonic because that was
the first device I ever used probably
about eight or nine years ago okay I
remember getting a Clarisonic when I was
like 16 or 17 at years old and I will
say I do think that when I had it that
really really bad acne xscape when I was
younger it did help me to cleanse my
skin it reminded me to really get like a
nice deep clean especially when you're
younger you don't think about it as
often but I loved my Clarisonic for
years but I feel like for real recently
within the past three to four years it
really has outdone Clarisonic a lot of
their devices are a lot cheaper you can
usually get them for sale at Sephora and
they do work a lot better for a lot of
different people you also don't have to
buy replacement brush heads which is a
huge thing the Clarisonic replacement
brush heads are expensive it's
like $40 for two and on top of that they
aren't even at cruelty free so a lot of
people don't purchase those so that is
definitely something I wanted to bring
up I feel like Faria definitely kind of
killed off Clarisonic up next we have
Lime Crime what really happened to Lime
Crime I know recently they kind of
jumped back on the bandwagon and they're
being sold at Ulta and you know they've
released a lot of new products but
personally I think dose of colors as
well as melt cosmetics kind of killed
them off they were this indie brand that
had a lot of pretty different palettes
their Venus palettes and then they had a
beautiful liquid lipsticks if I don't
say so myself I used to have quite a few
of their liquid lipsticks but then came
dose of colors then Kate Mel cosmetics
which was kind of like you know that
really a really a mystic feel I feel
like melt cosmetics really thinks
outside of the box and Lime Crime used
to be the brand that thought outside of
the box when it comes to color
combinations and different liquid
lipstick colors but now dohsa colors as
well as mal cosmetics are both sold at
Ulta as well and they have gone from an
indie brand to a big kind of mainstream
brand so in my opinion melt cosmetics as
well as dose of colors had definitely
killed off Lime Crime I don't hear a lot
of people talk about Lime Crime very
recently sometimes
something in my subscription feed and
people will be reviewing the newest
palate or something like that but for
the most part I think they're pretty
much done and finally let's talk about
Michael Todd Beauty now I will say
Michael Todd Beauty has been really good
to me they send me some PR and I do
prefer their a brush heads and their
cleansing devices over Clarisonic
obviously like I said Clarisonic brush
heads are not cruelty free Clarisonic is
not cruelty free um so I don't purchase
from them anymore personally but they do
have some really cool devices but I feel
like Michael Todd Beauty was killed off
by Mario Badescu Mario Badescu was kind
of in the scene 2 to 3 years after
Michael Todd Beauty Michael Todd Beauty
it kind of like MAC Cosmetics was the
one skincare brand that you would hear
every single person talk about on
YouTube if they were doing an eyeshadow
look they were using mac cosmetics that
they were doing a skincare routine they
were talking about Michael Todd Beauty
usually like their pumpkin enzyme mask
things like that and it's not to say
that they aren't a good brand it's just
that Mario Badescu offers the same sort
of thing for a much much cheaper price
and obviously now with Sephora and Ulta
you can find skincare brands that have
even better products than Mario Badescu
as well as Michael Todd Beauty but
totally I feel as if Mario Badescu
killed off Michael Todd Beauty so anyway
guys those are some beauty brands that
killed one another off let me know if
you want to add any down below but yeah
it will be interesting to see what the
future holds for these thanks so much
for joining me guys and I will see you
in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
