this video is going to be a new one this
is going to be a series that I do either
weekly or every other week or every two
weeks we'll see how we how goes how we
go so we'll see how it goes but this is
called my weekly Beauty Q&amp;amp;A so basically
if you guys haven't noticed if you
didn't you don't follow me on snapchat
or Instagram you may have noticed I am
no longer responding to comments I have
hit 14 thousand subscribers and I tried
for as long as I could to keep up with
every comment I really really did and I
basically had a mental breakdown the
other day on tests yet if you follow me
on stuff I had to take a few days away
from snapchat because I was so emotional
about this and I know it's very silly to
be so emotional about not being able to
answer comments but you know I came on
to YouTube to make friends to you know
communicate with people so it was very
very hard for me to think that that
wasn't going to be happening anymore but
that's definitely not the case I still
AM on you know in contact with people on
obviously Instagram and also snapchat
and I'm trying my best to keep up there
it's really hard for me on Instagram
because you know you can only scroll
down so far so I feel like you have to
go to every single photo that you posted
that day to know if people wrote to you
but I'm really trying my best to keep up
where I can so what I've decided to do
is since I'm no longer answering
comments and because I'm really really
I'm very nitpicky with this I don't like
the whole cherry-picking thing where you
literally go and like a youtuber picks
the comment that they want to you know
answer and then you see like a whole
string of people underneath that comment
saying like oh hi this is my question or
blah blah I just feel like it's kind of
messy and on top of that I don't like
the thought of cherry thinking I will
never pick one of you I love all of you
I'm not kidding I feel like I know a lot
of you so well so for me to do that just
feels wrong so I have been answering a
comments like here and there if it's
like a really really important kind of
like serious question but for the most
part I haven't been answering comments
and I thought that this weekly beauty
Q&amp;amp;A or every other week or two weeks
whatever we're gonna do we'll figure it
out I thought that this would be a nice
way for me to reach out to you guys on
snapchat Instagram and also take
questions that I saw during the week in
the comments section because I still
read all of the comments I thought it
would be a nice way to go and pick out
like ten questions every single
we can dancer them so anyway let's go
ahead and get started it the first
question is from Leslie Aaron and this
was on Instagram she said are you going
to be reviewing the lorac mega Pro 3 the
answer is yes I ordered it last night
um Ulta had like platinum early access
so yes I did order one and yes I will be
reviewing it question number 2 is from
Susan P and this was on YouTube she said
we're close to the same shade I'm NW 10
at Mac have you tried the laura mercier
baked to radiance zero one highlighter
I've been wanting to try that but I
wasn't sure if it would be light enough
I have tried it and I absolutely adore
it
it will be light enough for you it does
have a little bit of kind of like a I
think a little bit of a warmer undertone
if I remember correctly but it's
absolutely gorgeous on the skin it
glides on beautifully and it's perfect
for fair skin all right number three is
from star blue white red and this is
also on YouTube they said last year in
August and sometime in the fall I think
November there was a Sephora vib sale
unlimited in August and a one-time use I
think in November do you know when this
will be going on this year I know there
was one in the springtime so I don't
know any definitive dates if anybody
does know let us know in the comment
section but I'm pretty sure that those
sales go on like the second week of
November usually so I'm pretty sure it
will be in November hopefully the second
week alright the next question is from
Dede Nissan and this is also from
YouTube they said do you recommend the
Kiehl's products such as their midnight
serum and eye creams I honestly have not
tried a lot of Kiehl's products so I
can't really recommend anything to you
but I have heard really really
ooh I've heard really really good things
about their evoke auto eye cream so if
you ever find that I've heard literally
from like tens of thousands of people
that that's amazing so no I have not
tried a lot of Kiehl's products but I
will definitely look into them
the next question is from a Britta
Simone if this is from YouTube as well
and she said please help me I can't
decide which one to get the Kat Von D
shade + light contouring palette or the
Kevin of Kwan contour book - the first
one seems to be more versatile but
everybody raised about the second one
and it's a good value so I don't know
alright so I'm going to say right away I
do not own the Kat Von D or the Kevin of
Kwan now I do own a few products from
Kevin o Quan I have the sensual skin
enhancer and some sort of an eyeshadow
palette from them
I'm not like over the moon with them I
feel like the sensual skin enhancer is
so difficult to you it's like I don't
even know what to use it for so I end up
just kind of using it for concealer if
you have any recommendations on how I
should use that let me know down below
umm but yeah I've heard wonderful things
about the Kat Von D I remember what I
did at my first giveaway I did end up
picking out the Kat Von D because I
thought it would suit whoever won you
know I didn't know what kind of skin
tone they would have and I thought that
would be suitable for every single skin
tone so I feel like a lot of people say
that Kat Von D is definitely the best
like I said I don't personally have that
one but if I could recommend you one
that I do personally have I would say
the tart is from Tarte is really really
good the contouring palette and also I
do like the Too Faced cocoa contour but
my all-time favorite is the it cosmetics
what does it called you sculpted palette
alright moving on number six this is
from Cammie Roundtree this is from to
YouTube and she says is there a dupe for
Narses orgasm blush I'm sure that there
is I honestly don't know of any I don't
have any of my collection I don't own
narcissus gasm I don't even own a
full-size NARS blush except for the dual
intensity blush which I'm decluttering
because I just it's too much to work
with it's very hard to work with anyway
so I don't actually know I feel like
there obviously should be so definitely
let us know down in the comments I'm
sure somebody will know it do but yeah I
don't know one off the top of my head
alright so the next question is from
Tanya Selfridge this is from YouTube on
my Becca vs. jus a rose quartz
comparison video she said I missed out
on the Dior glowing gardens pink
highlight which of these will come the
closest to that one in your opinion so
the do your glowing gardens I would say
the one that would come the closest is
probably the Gigi way because it's got
that base gel a sort of formulation
going on the back is definitely more of
like a neutral mid-tones pink and I feel
like the GG way has that white white
kind of undertone which the Dior one
does as well so definitely the G way
alright the next question is from Pixie
lash and this was on YouTube again on
the becca versus jus a rose quartz
comparison video she said I always have
a problem with colored highlighters
showing up on my fair skin I kind of
want to try the becca one but I am
worried about it darkening up
so I have to ask since I noticed in your
collection video you have the Jacqueline
heal Beca palette do the formulations of
the highlighters in that palette differ
from regular full-size highlighters from
Becca I do find they differ a little bit
not too much I would say the Jaclyn Hill
collection face palette I felt like the
you know highlighters in there were very
creamy very very buttery some people
were saying that there's felt like
sandpaper my don't feel like sandpaper
they were a little more rough than say
it my full-size machine ring skin
Perfector press that I personally own
but I don't think there's that much of a
difference alright the next question is
from Tabata Nelson and this is from a
YouTube they said have you tested to
face Grand Hotel cafe I have and
hopefully I'll be able to get up my
review today if not tomorrow or the next
day or whenever I can get it up I have
had it for about five days now and I'm
really really liking it I think it's
definitely the best Christmas in New
York like palette so far out of the
whole toothpaste collection and the last
question is from Abigail
Prather and it is the YouTube it was a
question it a question on YouTube and on
it was on the Sephora collection face
palette revealed that I did does that
make any sense she said I know this
palette is not truly comparable to the
hourglass 2016 holiday palette but if
you have to pick one which of the two
would you say is worth purchasing so the
hourglass so many people are not liking
this palette but you have had you had to
like purchase last year's palette to
understand and like this year's palette
if you bought last year's palette you
know that the pan sizes are small you
don't get a whole lot in there but I get
so much use out of that 2015 palettes so
so so much use so I personally would say
that the hourglass palette this year is
worth it but there are a lot of people
that disagree with me do your own
research if you do not want small pan
sizes that literally is like $80 then
definitely don't get it I think that
Sephora um
you know face palette that it shows you
guys the blush bronze and whatever it's
called ready to glow is absolutely
stunning and beautiful very very
worthwhile you get huge pan sizes in
there I would definitely recommend
checking that one out first and then
going and checking out the hourglass and
seeing what is right for you so anyway
that is it for my first Beauty qat I
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for joining me and I'll see
you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
