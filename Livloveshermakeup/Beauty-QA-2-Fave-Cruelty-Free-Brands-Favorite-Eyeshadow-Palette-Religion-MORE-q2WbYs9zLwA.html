have another Beauty Q&amp;amp;A for you guys
today this is something that I've
decided to do every single Saturday
after look of the week I pulled a few
questions from YouTube and then I also
asked you guys on snapchat and Instagram
if you had any beauty related questions
you wanted to answer or you wanted me to
answer and I chose 10 of them I'm going
to be doing ten every single week any
questions that I did not get to you guys
asked a lot which was really sweet thank
you so much you guys asked a lot so any
that i did not get to i will get to next
week or the week after don't worry your
questions will be answered so i chose
ten that were beauty related and then
there were quite a few that were non
beauty related and i thought i could
just add those in at the end so i'm
gonna answer three that were not beauty
related but anyway let's go ahead and
get right into it if the first question
is from Abby hi Evie this was on
snapchat and she asked what's your
favorite drugstore mascara and lip gloss
so as far as lip gloss is concerned I
have a couple from Maybelline that I'm
really really into the first one is
called 110 mirrored mob it looks like
this and you get tons and tons of
product in these Maybelline tubes and
the second one here is called I think
toasted almond um no it's called omens
crush I can barely read it but this is
what they look like these are really
really nice and they're not super super
pigmented but they're also not super
super sticky and tacky I feel like they
have the perfect amount of pigmentation
they're comfortable on the lips and I do
you find them quite moisturizing so i
would say these are probably my favorite
drugstore lip glosses and also the NYX
butter glosses are absolutely fantastic
and as far as mascara is concerned my
miss manga rock mascara from l'oreal is
definitely my all-time favorite from the
drugstore this is unfortunately not sold
anymore though so i would say that just
the original covergirl supersizers is
probably my second pick all right the
second question is from Diane myriad
this was on youtube on my foundation
declutter video she said out of all the
foundations you are keeping which would
you say are the most mattifying with the
fullest coverage so the most mattifying
with the fullest coverage the first one
would definitely be the Revlon Colorstay
whipped creme foundation the shade I
wear is 110 ivory I also would say the
Tarte Amazonian clay full coverage
foundation the shade that I where is
fair beige
great formatted like mattifying the skin
and also just really really full
coverage and then also the estee lauder
double wear when you first put this on
it does look a little more dewy but it
does dry down completely matte in my
opinion the shade that I where is one
and one if you are curious and then I
would also say my L'Oreal infallible Pro
matte foundation definitely keeps you
very mad and has a very full coverage
all right did the next question is from
jazz del Rey this was on Instagram and
she asked when did you start getting
interested in makeup and develop a
passion for it so I wouldn't necessarily
say I'm passionate about makeup I really
really like makeup but when I think of
like passion I think of music you know
things that like I would die without i
would probably I mean I wouldn't die
without makeup but you don't even like
the things that are super super
passionate and close to my heart are
mostly like music related by definitely
beauty stuff is second like definitely
comes in second I really do enjoy a
beauty related things and I started
getting interested in makeup when I was
about 12 or 13 years old by the time I
was 13 I was actually wearing a full
face of foundation like a lot of
foundation like too much foundation um
and I was wearing eyeliner mascara
everything so I definitely got into it
at a young age I've always really really
enjoyed look of like a full coverage
face I don't know why so i would say
that i got interested in tpain makeup
when I was about 12 or 13 years old
alright the next question is from above
diamonds and rubies and this was on
Instagram she asked what are your
favorite cruelty free makeup brands i
would say probably hourglass and of
course to face which is my all-time
favorite brand the next question is from
Chelsea Rose this was also on Instagram
and she asked what is your all-time
favorite eyeshadow palette that you own
so this is just such a hard question but
if I had to choose I would go with this
one from to face this is the natural eye
and the reason why I'm saying that is
because check this baby out I have hit
complete pan on this I've hit pan on
this color this color almost on these
colors in the middle I just feel like
that's the way that you can tell if you
really love a palette or not is if you
have hit pan on it so definitely the
natural I 9pm
pallet from Too Faced the next question
is let's see here from Samantha Corey
this is also on Instagram they said if
you could only use one makeup product
for the rest of your life what would it
be and i would say foundation and
specifically i would choose this little
guy it's not technically hmm sorry i was
eating chips earlier and i feel like i'm
spitting them up anyway and this is not
technically a foundation it's actually a
CC cream but this is from covergirl this
is the tone rehab foundation or base in
the shade 105 I free I just feel like
for me personally like when I was saying
earlier when i was younger i love the
look of a full like coverage face I mean
like a base I feel like the one makeup
product that I would reach for and
rather have over eyeliner or mascara is
foundation I just think evening out your
skin can make such a difference and how
you look so I would definitely say this
and I just love this product so much
unfortunately has been discontinued
hopefully I can find something similar
in the future alright the next question
is from pixie lash this was asked to on
instagram and this question is sort of
similar if you could only buy makeup
from one brand for the rest of your life
what brand would it be definitely to
face that is my all-time favorite brand
alright the next question is from
according to Amy this is also on
Instagram and she asked when you have to
do your makeup quickly what is your
go-to look so for sure I use this
covergirl Plusle a CC cream it's just so
easy to blend and I feel like two pumps
of this completely evens out my skin
then I'll go in with like my essence all
about match-fixing compact powder I like
to put on what is it my it cosmetics is
Janice a quad bone really quickly on my
lips and then I like to put on the
knicks single shadow in the shade at
bedroom eyes I believe it's called is
just a nice pink shimmery color I Pat
that all over my lid and then I put on
my outrageous curl mascara and you guys
are probably good doubt that is a look
that I jumped you very very frequently
when I'm in a hurry in the morning and
I'm pretty sure it is the exact look
that I used for my five-minute makeup
tutorial alright moving on the next
question is from Julie rocket queen hi
Joanie this was on YouTube she asked
what are your favorite products for
regrowing eyebrows I know you mentioned
some eyelash products but I have
forgotten what they were my eyelashes
are okay but I need some brow help so
the eyelash products that I have
mentioned before are definitely the
cargo lash
celebrator serum which I love my
eyelashes don't naturally look like this
I know I get a lot of compliments on my
eyelashes girl they look like that
because i use lash accelerating products
while ash is also a really really
fabulous one and also rapid lashes very
good now as far as brows are concerned I
do get brow shedding especially when I'm
in like a lupus flare-up I get a lot of
eyebrow shedding and also I last
shedding so what I like to use is this
product right here from rapid brow i
think i purchased this for around thirty
or forty dollars lua 30 25 30 or
something like that on Alta and I do
like it you just put it on kind of like
you would a brow gel this is what it
looks like and I combed this through my
brows on one side at night and then I
flip it over and do the other side it
kind of tangled a little bit and if
you're really really sensitive skin this
can give a little bit of irritation I
don't think it helps to regrow your bar
your brows but I do feel like it helps
to strengthen the ones that are there so
that they don't fall out more as far as
like removing makeup is concerned
instead of going in with like a really
harsh makeup removing wipe I highly
recommend checking out a oil based
makeup remover anytime I'm using
something like my faja break makeup
break up cool cleansing oil or something
that is oil based and notice that my
eyelashes and my eyebrows are in a lot
better condition so anyway those are my
tips besides that I've heard that castor
oil is really good you can put a little
bit on your eyelashes and also your
eyebrows alright moving on it the last
beauty related question is from makaylia
and this was on snapchat as well and she
said what is the best high-end
foundation that isn't a serum or a stick
from me I would for sure say the Tarte
Amazonian clay full coverage foundation
I love this foundation and it's not in
serum form it's not in stick form I
would show you guys the josie maran
vibrancy foundation fluid but I almost
feel like that is kind of syrah me
because it is filled with oil so this is
the one that I would definitely choose
alright and let's go on and answer the
three non beauty related questions the
first one is from Jules perks 11 this
was on Instagram and she asked non
beauty related are you Christian or do
you have another religion normally I
don't like to talk about this on my
channel because I feel like it's just my
channel is not the place for religion
and things like that but so many people
have been asking so I thought I would
just answer I am NOT
Christian and I'm actually not a
religious person but that does not mean
that I don't respect people who do
practice other religions all right
moving on the second question is from
Caitlin wilt and this was also on
snapchat non beauty-related she asked
did you apply for any music scholarships
when applying for college if so do you
remember which one so I did not
personally apply for any I was in very
good like financial care with my parents
which was really sweet they helped me
through all four years of college so I
did not actually qualify for financial
aid however when I did go in and do my
audition I was offered eighty-five
percent fold like basically almost full
ride to ition throughout all four years
of college and it was merit-based so
that means that i went in and i took a
really really solid audition and they
ended up getting me merit-based
scholarship so I didn't personally apply
for any but they did grant me one at the
end which was so so so sweet it was very
helpful because in New York you know
especially like private conservatories
it was 40 50 60 thousand dollars a year
so to have eighty five percent of that
covered every single year for all four
years was really really helpful but no I
didn't personally apply for any all
right and then the last question is from
I mean the feliciano i think so i think
that's your name I'm so sorry if I
Richard that this is on Instagram and
she said do you miss New York and I
definitely miss New York it's funny
because I'm one of those people I love
to travel so I don't mind living in
different places so far I've lived in
Minneapolis Minnesota I lived in
Manhattan for five years and I'm living
in Milwaukee I love Milwaukee I love
Minneapolis I Love New York I'm just
really love being in different places we
will be moving in a year as well we're
gonna be moving to Cleveland Ohio and
I'm excited for that as well so no I
wouldn't really say that I miss New York
there are certain things that I really
do miss like the food is so freaking
good I definitely missed the food i
missed the art museums i miss just being
more surrounded by people in the arts
because manhattan is just filled with
people like that but for the most part i
would say i'm really really happy in
milwaukee and i'm just happy being in
different places so i wouldn't say that
i miss it terribly so anyway that is it
for today's Beauty QA I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me and I will see you guys
