my I guess it's kind of like a reveal
slash my beauty room for 2016 I guess
it's my beauty room slash music room of
a reveal so this is basically my tour
I'm going to show you guys everything
that's in here and I'm going to start
with the makeup side please keep in mind
that you guys know I am a musician and
this is also my practice space and where
I teach as well so I put the shades down
for privacy reasons but I'm going to
start and just go through everything and
show you guys where I got everything so
starting over here I have my jewelry
area and I'm going to go a little
further back by the way I have all of my
youtube lighting on right now so I just
got this
ring light right here my boyfriend got
that from me for um Christmas so that is
the only light that I film with now and
then that is my lamp over there but
these two bulbs that are really bright
right there I used to film with those
before I had my ring light but I thought
for this video just so that was really
really good lighting everywhere I would
just turn everything on so starting
right here this is the door into my
Beauty room and this little thing right
here is actually the light switch from
my childhood home when I moved here my
mom ended up sending me a box and was
like do you remember this and I was like
yes I do it's Peter Rabbit alright and
then I have my three princesses these
are probably the most the most
frequently asked question I get is where
did you get those three princesses so I
have Belle I have Cinderella and I also
have Snow White and I got these at
Target you guys however I did see these
you can get them in a glittery sparkly
form or just the matte form like I have
I did see these at t.j.maxx for half the
price so I got these for $30 apiece at
Target but you can get these for $15.99
a piece at t.j.maxx like I said you can
get glittery ones as well they're just
really really cute and I thought they
were adorable kind of going up in a
stepwise motion above my jewelry table
so the next thing to talk about
obviously is that the jewelry table so
this is where I keep all
my jewelry I will be doing a separate
tour on this whole little section here
at my jewelry organization where I walk
through everything and tell you where I
got everything but this little table
right here I ordered from Amazon it has
this little pullout right here and
please don't get freaked out I like to
collect little masks I know that's
really strange
I just did I used to have these out in
my apartment in New York but there
wasn't room for them but all of these
are from Italy that I've collected I
have always been very fascinated with
masks and then I just have some random
little like brooches and things like
that in here and then um when my cat
died they took a little like paw print
for her and also I got her privately
cremated and she is right here with me
but anyway it opens up like this this is
a fifty dollar desk and I really liked
it because it was white and I thought it
was really nice and I will link below
where you guys can get that from Amazon
but anyway I just have all of these
little jewelry accessories I have big
necklaces there some dainty ones there I
have bracelets right here I got this
from Bath and Body Works a pedestal and
then I have a peppermint candle burning
right here is just an old um what does
that call it's like a little it's like a
picture frame and basically I just put
some earrings on there that I thought
were pretty these tea lights are from
are these tea lights is that what you
call them or is it called like fairy
lights or something that little string
of them is from Target as well yes and
then all three of these little racks
back here are from hmm it's either the
dollar store or they are from ooh you
guys I can't remember it's either The
Container Store or the dollar store I
can't really remember but I will think
about it and again when I go through my
jewelry organization and like tour video
I will you know
I'll really try and remember where
everything is and I will link it below
and then this is from these are just
like dainty necklaces here and that
little case thing is from again I think
The Container Store but when I go into
depth about this little organization
area I will tell you guys exactly where
it's from and then I put my rings here I
have a little set of earrings right
there and then I have some more
necklaces right there so that is my
jewelry area and that
is in the background of my videos and
there are the ladies next we are going
to look down a little bit and come upon
my perfume collection so this is my
perfume collection I will also be doing
a perfume collection video where I go
through and I talk about each one and
tell you guys what I like and what I
don't like these are all my body mists
all my perfumes and I really really love
them they're beautiful i reorganize this
particular area all the time so I don't
have like a set thing for it but this
tiny little short table I got from
Amazon it is from Ikea but I ordered it
on Amazon it was only 23 dollars and
then right here I have this blank area
and the one thing that I want to do I
have two unfinished things in this
beauty room the first thing I want to do
is get acrylic racks and put nail
polishes there and then the second thing
is I don't have a Beauty room chair yet
so that is what I plan on doing right
here I have some mercury glass I really
really love mercury glass and this is
filled with lip products all the way up
but my mom got me backed is one of my
Christmas gifts and then this little guy
I got from TJ Maxx and then right here I
have these little tiny dainty perfumes
and the reason I don't have them down
there is just because they get really
really cluttered easily and I just think
they are very delicate and adorable so I
wanted to put them on a separate little
area and this little tray is actually
serving tray from Ulta during the
holidays they had this thing where you
could get a set of four serving trays
and basically it was very strange if you
ordered a perfume you got a set of four
serving trays and this big one could not
fit in armed like dish cabinet so I went
ahead and just you know put the tiny
little dainty perfumes on here they're
just like you know Lady Gaga and Miss
Dior and all that kind of stuff very
very cute and then I have my Alex series
9 drawer all of my makeup is in there
and I will be doing going through that
with you guys and doing the you know
showing you my organization and my
makeup collection that will be in the
next two weeks all of the collection
videos the perfume one the jewelry one
and the makeup collection will be going
up within the next two weeks so if for
some reason you see a piece and I'm not
quite sure where it's from I promise I
will think about
everything and I'll try and remember
where I found everything and I will link
it below in those videos but anyway that
is that little area and then right here
we have this mirror this is um well
first let me talk about the desk so I
have the five drawers from Alex on each
side by the yoga mat underneath really
random two trash cans and then I have
this Lin one tabletop I purposely got
the one that reaches a little further
back because I knew I wanted to balance
a mirror here so this mirror was from
t.j.maxx it was only um 29.99 or $39.99
really really good deal and it's very
very nice I was originally going to turn
it the other way and have it hanging but
it was too heavy and I like it vertical
so that is that and then again all of
the lip products that I own are right
here on the desk except for the ones
that are in there but anyway right here
I have a bouquet of fake flowers I have
fake white silk roses and they are in a
vase from Target and then these little
apakah scenary jars I think that's what
how you call it a pocket berry these are
all three filled with my lip balms I
have a lot of lip balms I'm a flute
player I just like them like that and
then I have all of my lip products all
the way along here again during my
makeup collection video you guys will
see everything so don't worry and then
that pretty much sums up all of the
makeup stuff um right here I have a
little thing that is filled with cards
and pens and things like that just so I
can write you guys notes like for the
giveaway winners and then we're going to
turn over here and you guys can see I
have my music stand here and right here
I have my little coloring book I have my
agenda my key little lamb' my metronome
the love of my life I have a few musical
instruments here this is my lucky music
chair I was going to use this underneath
the Alex desk like that area but
honestly I want like an acrylic chair
you know those like see-through ones or
either a white one if you guys have any
recommendations let me know below and
then over here I have some of my music
stuff my boyfriend got me this for
Christmas how cute is that it is a pink
flute case I love it I am still going
through my music this is only about a
third of my music and so I am going to
go through it I'm in alphab
everything so this section is still not
complete but these two little drawers
right here I also ordered from Amazon
those are the 23 dollar ones that I have
my perfumes in just you guys know
alright and then I have a big chunky
right underneath I have a little
keyboard just for when my students are
here and I need to you know play
something or whatnot then I have some
method books right there this little box
right here I sometimes keep one of my
recorders in no mom got that for me and
then before my grandma passed away she
got me this pillow it says music the
favorite passion of my soul so that's
kind of my music area it's not
completely set and the reason that I
have to have this big area like right
here that has a lot of space is because
I need this area for chamber music and
for my students and things like that so
all of my make up kind of stuff is over
in that corner so now we are going to go
into the closet which is right here and
again this has my skincare my haircare
my purse is all that kind of stuff so
down here yes here we go here is part of
my skincare collection all the way
through my haircare stuff now there is a
reason I store everything like this it
is because I like to have bird's-eye
view on things because I am one of those
people out of sight out of mind
so starting over here we have hand
creams and foot creams I have like
beauty tools right there I have my oils
my eye makeup removers and my firming
body treatments there I have my
moisturizers for my face body butters
body moisturizers both boxes there are
face masks and then I have extra
cleansers toners eye creams things like
that and then over there is all haircare
products over there are my hair
accessories and then right here by a
shower curtain rod rings I hang my
Beauty like my heating products or my
heat tools I do have like a curler and
two straighteners and things like that
that are not hanging there right now
because they are in my guest bathroom
and then right here I hang my purses and
I hang them by shower curtain rings or
shower curtain rod so that I can just
flick through them and grab the purse
that I want again I will do a more
in-depth I'm going to be doing a
skincare organization and also skincare
organization and skincare collection
video and
haircare collection video and haircare
organization and I will go through each
and every single product and then if you
look up you can see I have extra
wallflowers there from Bath and Body
Works behind there I have my three wick
candles then I have some bath products
these are from philosophy and then all
the way around here all the way these
are all from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works bubble
bath stress relief baths things like
that I love my bubble baths one from
Mario Badescu a couple body scrubs I
have the caress passionate spell that is
a body wash a coconut body scrub my
summer's eve cleansing wash and then I
have three little hand sanitizers and
then that big bin right there that is
still filled with samples and basically
um those are just extra products this is
where I store basically extra products
that I'm not using currently the
products that I am using currently I
store in my guest bathroom so that is
thank you guys this is my Beauty room

need all the room I can get and you guys
