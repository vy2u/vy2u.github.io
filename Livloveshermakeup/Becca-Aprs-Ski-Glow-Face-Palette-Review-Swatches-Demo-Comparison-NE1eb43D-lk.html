my channel happy Tuesday today I am
finally giving you guys on my review on
the new Becca apply ski glow face
palette I did purchase this for $54 on
the sephora.com website this is a
limited edition for holiday 2017 and it
is formulated without parabens sulfates
theta lates and it is cruelty free now
inside of here you are getting three
shimmering skin perfecter press in opal
rose quartz as well as icicle you are
getting a luminous blush in blushed
copper a mineral blush in winter berry
as well as the sunlit bronzer in bronzed
Bondi icicle and winter berry are
exclusive and new to this particular
palette and the rest of the shades we
have seen before in the becca
collection so anyway here is what to the
actual palette looks like I'm gonna do a
little bit I'm gonna insert a little bit
of a close-up here so you guys can
really see it it is a beautiful
beautiful palette with this gorgeous
kind of frosty thing going on all over
the outside as well the inside you have
a beautiful mirrored effect that is like
a light baby blue it's very very hard to
describe and kind of show on camera
because it is so light reflective but
honestly the packaging on this it's just
ten out of ten it's absolutely gorgeous
so anyway let's go ahead and start with
these shades selection like I said you
do get a variety of shades in here you
are getting two blushes in here you are
also getting a let's see here are three
different highlighters as well as a
bronzer so I guess we will start with
this guy right here this is the rose
quartz shimmering skin Perfector press
it is absolutely beautiful
it is kind of like a mid-tone pink shade
and I do actually own this in full size
and next up we do have icicle which is a
beautiful kind of duo chromatic
highlighter initially when you look at
this you might think that it looks very
very similar to Becca's pearl which is
basically just like a cool tone
opalescent white shade it doesn't have
too much of like a bluish or cool
undertone or a warm undertone however
Icicle actually has a beautiful blue
shift to it and if you want to get more
like a purpley highlighter you can
actually mix the two of these together
rose quartz mixed together with icicle
is absolutely gorgeous on the skin all
right up next to the up with winter
berry winterberry may look very familiar
to you guys if you do have the Abeka
chrissy teigen a palette you may think
that it looks very similar to the blush
in there or
even if you do have the Jaclyn hill
champagne collection base palette you
may be thinking it looks similar to
Pomplamoose and I have to say overall it
is very very similar but that does have
this sort of trend of kind of recycling
the same shades over and over again in
their palettes and basically just
renaming them but I can I kind of
understand what they were going for when
it comes to this palette when you are
making a palette that only comes in one
shade selection you want to make sure
that it is universally flattering or it
tries to be a universally flattering for
everybody and I can see why this
particular shade of blush might be more
universally flattering for very very
light skin tones as well as very very
deep skin tones all right up next we do
have the beautiful blush copper blush
now originally I thought this was their
a blush copper shimmering skin perfecter
but it's really a gorgeous gorgeous kind
of blush if you do have more of a medium
to deeper complexion for me it does look
a little muddy on my skin tone it's not
my all-time favorite I definitely prefer
winter berry but still really nice that
they pop that baby in there because I
love these luminous of blush formula and
then right here we do have opal opal is
a signature sort of shimmering skin
perfecter press as far as the Becca line
is concerned it is absolutely beautiful
and if you want to kind of get a little
interesting and kind of mix and match
some of the highlighters in here opal
pairs together beautifully with the
blushed copper if you want to use that
as the true highlight if you do have a
deeper complexion and also opal mixed
together with rose quartz is absolutely
stunning especially if you do have like
a medium complexion and then finally we
have bronze Bondi which is a really
really nice of deeper bronzer this is
just not the most flattering bronzer on
me personally but I will be inserting
demo clips so you guys can see kind of
how it looks on me I wear this more as
they contour and it definitely leans a
little more on the red tone sign but it
is very very beautiful so overall that
is the V shade selection I think they
did pretty darn good because let's be
honest I mean like I said you really
want to be as universally flattering as
you can when it does come to a shade
selection if you're only going to be
releasing a one sort of face palette so
I think they did a pretty good job yes
it does
Eadie's kind of filled with like
recycled shades from other em back up
pallets but i feel like if you are a
true collector and you love the
packaging and the overall feel and for
me personally every single time I travel
I always take up my backpack Jaclyn hill
palette these are just really great
pallets for travel I feel like they're
sturdy they have huge mirrors so you can
kind of pop it up on your table and just
try to look at your makeup and apply
your makeup they have a mixture of
bronzers and hang laters and all sorts
of good stuff in here so I reach for
these a lot and I know that I would get
a lot of use out of this baby right here
now as far as formula is concerned a lot
of people do talk about how sometimes
these pallets are not formulated the
same as the full sizes and I think that
they are formulated the same this time I
definitely feel like with the Becca
champagne collection face palette the
Jaclyn hill one and this one definitely
had a little more of like sandpaper II
feel when it came at to the shimmering
skin perfectors in here which are
Prosecco pop as well as champagne pop
these were formulated differently when I
did compare the ingredients I noticed
that there were a little bit of a
differentials they're different you'll
see sighs know what I mean stuff was
different okay but when it comes through
the new app play glow ski face palette I
definitely feel like the formula is the
same or at least comparison wise when I
look at the ingredients list the only
thing I will say is that they are
pressed up just a little bit firmer now
that can be a very good thing because
you know you guys want to take this for
travel right I mean a lot of people will
be traveling with this particular
palette when they go ahead and they do a
press these just a little firmer you're
gonna get the same amount of
pigmentation it's not going to be a soft
and buttery but at the same time it's
not gonna shatter and now it Becca
shimmering skin perfectors and tend to
shatter in general the bread the press
versions do so it is actually pretty
good that they went ahead and they press
these a little formula firmer so overall
I would say the formula is pretty much
the same as you would get any full sizes
it's just pressed a little firmer it may
feel a little more scratchy to the touch
I don't want to say scratchy because
that's not the right way to say it but
it is just a little more firmly pressed
so overall I would say formula is still
really good pigmentation is there if
you've ever worked with a Becca
shimmering skin perfecter press before
you want to go in with me very very
fluffy brush these do kick up a lot of
product at once so when you kind of
swirl in there and apply it to your
cheeks you kind of want to build it up a
little bit because these do have the
tendency to start to emphasize a little
bit of texture
fine lines and wrinkles on your face my
favorite brush for any Becca shimmering
skin perfecter press is definitely the
luck see 522 tapered highlighter as far
as the bronzer is concerned in here if
you really want to go ahead and kind of
like sculpt out your cheekbones I would
recommend any real techniques what is
this sculpting brush I feel like this
would be great if you do up like a
medium complexion or a deeper complexion
you really kind of want to chisel things
out for me I did go in today with my
morphe angled a fluffy brush just
because I don't want too much I mean
this is a very very deep bronzer in here
which is fantastic for those of you who
do have more of a medium to deep
complexion but for me it tends to be a
little more on the red tone side it can
get money very quickly so I have to be
careful and then as far as the blushes
are concerned in here again I like to go
in with a fluffy brush the mineral
blushes are incredibly incredibly
pigmented if you are new and to the
Becca luminous flushed a formula or
they've got a mineral blush formula all
of them are very very pigmented
including the luminous flux formula so
do not be deceived just because the name
seems like it might be a little more on
the sheer toe inside it's not sheer ok
these are very very pigmented so overall
I feel like sheet selection formula
everything is really really good as far
as that is concerned I would definitely
get this palette 4 out of 5 stars do I
love it as much as my cover FX perfect
highlighting palette for holiday 2017
honestly no don't this guy right here
does retail for $39 I'm at the Becca is
$54 I'll go ahead and insert some
side-by-side swatches if you guys are
curious all to cover effects on this
side and then the Becca on this side but
I personally feel like I still prefer
this guy over here just because it's all
highlighters it really is universally
flattering I'm loving this formula even
though this particular formula is
definitely very very powdery kind of
like the Becca formula I don't know
there's just something about this
highlighting palette that is hitting
like and hitting the ballpark for me 10
out of 10 5 out of 5 when it comes to
this guy so I would still recommend if
you really want a nice highlighting
palette for the holiday season go for
the perfect highlighting palette from
cover FX however if you do want the
mixture of blushes as well as bronzers I
would go for the Becca this is quite
pricey but I feel like you are
purchasing it for the packaging for the
overall feel this is great for trampled
like I said these giant mirrors are just
absolutely fantastic when you're
traveling because
just set it up on a table and you can do
your makeup in them you know without
having to look in a big mirror but yes
if you are concerned there are
definitely recycled shades in here so
again I'm going to go ahead and insert
swatches of the Abeka Jaclyn kala
champagne collection face palette over
here and then the Becca at place Key
Club face palette over here you guys
will be able to see there are definitely
recycled shades inherent if you already
own at the Becca or the Chrissy Teigan
do you need the new one absolutely not
you don't you're gonna have the same
sort of feel the same sort of looks and
again I feel like in general a Becca
phase Palestine to cater to those who do
have more of like a light to medium
complexion but this one right here I
feel like it's really gonna be great
even if you do have a deeper complexion
so again here's the Chrissy Teigen
here's the Becca a place key glow I'll
go ahead and insert side-by-side
swatches again but I yeah that's pretty
much it I don't have too much to say you
guys know I'm a longtime fan of a Becca
face products in general I'm a huge
collection of Becca products so I am
giving this a good four out of five
stars it's not 5 out of 5 it's not
knocking on my socks off like in the
cover FX perfect highlighting palette
and this guy was just so special to me
because I've never tried out be
highlighting formula from cover FX a
step for an e liquid version and I just
feel like this has really kind of taken
the holiday scene up by storm I know a
lot of people have been saying oh you
know I haven't really heard about this
or nobody really talks about this but
this is definitely something that that's
catching my eye and this shade right
here is very very similar to the Icicle
shade of from the cover FX palette but
but yeah guys overall I would say I'm
pretty impressed with this palette like
I said 4 out of 5 stars for sure or 9
out of 10 I don't know where this whole
star thing came by it apparently for
holiday 2017 reviews I'm giving stars
now so for me personally like I said 4
out of 5 stars would still give the
perfect highlighting palette 5 out of 5
just because I just I'm really in love
with this particular highlighting
palette I want to do a best and worst of
holiday 2017 video for you guys next
week featuring all the products that I
have purchased but this is pretty high
up
me this is pretty high up on the list is
definitely a good face palette if you
feel like you're gonna use it if you
really really like the shades I would go
ahead and pick up I think it's worth it
so I hope you enjoyed this video thank
you so much
you guys I will see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
