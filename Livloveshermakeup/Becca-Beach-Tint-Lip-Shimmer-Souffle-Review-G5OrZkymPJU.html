doing another review for you guys today
it is another product that you can pick
up at Ulta it is the new Becca Beach
tint lip shimmer souffle comes in
packaging like this
and you can choose between six different
shades on the website the particular
shade that I got is lychee / topaz so
they come in like a duo so you get
shimmer and color together so they have
six different shades the shades are
watermelon / opal guava / opal raspberry
/ opal lychee / topaz papaya / topaz and
fig / topaz so basically you're getting
color in here with shimmer this kind of
goes after their shimmer Beach tint
shimmers new place that they have for
cheek this is the beach tint shimmer
souffle cheek product and this is in
watermelon / moonstone so again you can
see that you get this kind of creamy
product that has both color and shimmer
in it or color and a highlight in it
basically so this particular color the
shape that I picked up is basically the
color is lychee and the highlight that
you get in there is topaz so yeah kind
of cool so basically this is supposed to
be like a really nice glossy formula I
would call it more of a gloss like a lip
gloss more than a lipstick you can see
the packaging is like this really really
cute it does come with a sticker with
the name on it and you just pull the cap
off and you can see the applicator is
just straight-up plastic and how you get
the product out is actually there's a
little button here and you push it so it
pushes out like that and as you can see
the color starts to come out you can
really see the difference between the
highlight and the actual color I'm gonna
swatch it right here on my hand so you
guys can see so you can see that that
highlight color in there which is the
Topaz really kind of blends in nicely
with the lip color which is the lychee
so you end up with this kind of muted
I'm wearing it on my lips today too if
you guys are wondering this kind of
muted light pinky nude color I
they really like it I think it makes my
lips look nice and plump which they
aren't but it makes them look nice and
plump because it does have that nice
built-in highlighter in there and I am
just absolutely in love with the formula
this is like a great formula absolutely
not sticky at all when I move my lips
together it just feels like butter it
feels like bite Beauty products like
really really really really good when it
comes to texture so like I said that is
the swatch of the color that I have you
can kind of see a little bit of Sheen in
there they're just great they're not
sticky they really give some nice color
they're not the most pigmented I would
say maybe medium to build you know like
buildable heavy coverage but they're
super glossy they stay super glossy on
the lips they do tend to wear off a
little quickly so you want to carry it
with you so that you can you know touch
up throughout the day but this little
applicator part here just so you guys
can see is very very flexible it's kind
of like rubber and it really bends
nicely I just like the way that that
works and I like that it doesn't have
any little like spongy stuff at the top
it just feels really sanitary I like the
way they did the packaging I think it's
really really sleek and nice like I said
the packaging is beautiful and then you
can actually see a little bit of the
color there so I'm going to read a
little more on the Ulta website for you
guys it says beach tint lip shimmer sue
plays every single one of them is $24
like I said you can pick six different
shades
it says Becca Beach tint lip shimmer
souffle is a double dose of pigment and
shimmer this lightweight marbled gloss
melts beautifully into the lips the
satiny soft textured drenches lips and
hydrating color while brown algae
extract smooths and softens for
sophisticated shine that lasts for hours
and I mean I really just agree with all
of that I think it's just a wonderful
wonderful glossy product on like I said
you can build up coverage but it's
really kind of like a medium coverage I
would say um stays very glossy feels
moisturizing feels great when you rub
your lips together and I'm really really
happy I would definitely definitely
consider going and purchasing a few more
shades of this um this was actually like
the brightest color that it they seemed
to have on the website
the other ones are a little more muted
you get some berry colors and some red
colors but I just thought this one
looked it looks even more bright on the
website but I just thought it looked the
most like summery that's why I picked it
up but I would definitely also consider
picking up maybe the fig / topaz which
is like a nude color so anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed this review of the
Bekaa Beach tint lip shimmer souffles if
you did give this video a thumbs up and
I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
