my channel today's video is going to be
a review of swatches in comparison on
all six of the new limited edition Becca
Lite chaser highlighters I did purchase
all six of them for $34 a piece on the
sephora.com website I believe the total
came out to about $200 I will be
returning two of these so I'll get some
of my money back but I wasn't I didn't
really mind I mean it's not the first
time I've dropped a couple hundred
dollars at Sephora that's all I'll say
anyway it says right here on the website
more than a highlighter the light chaser
highlighters transformative formula is
the perfect marriage of kaleidoscope
color and light each shade is infused
with kaleidoscope pearls that chase the
light front out worldly or otherworldly
glow that makes your favorite features
beam bright this unique highlighter
shift shades as you move delivering
hypnotizing colored luminosity with a
metamorphic finish now it does say that
these are cruelty free Becca is a
cruelty free company if you guys didn't
know that you own our they are owned by
a parent company that tests on animals
but they themselves do not test on
animals and these highlighters are
paraben free as well as sulfate free and
the packaging is really gorgeous so it's
the typical sort of packaging little
tiny flying saucers as you guys can see
the outer packaging was like a gorgeous
soft opalescent white box with a little
bit of a holographic finish I don't have
it anymore if you guys didn't know we're
moving soon so I kind of went ahead and
toss those out but yeah this is what the
actual packaging looks like so you have
this nice kind of I don't even know how
to describe this is kind of like a
coppery goldish color and then as you
can see it's the tiny flying saucer you
are getting let's see here six point
five grams of product or 0.23 ounces per
pan which really isn't too bad these are
not the same size as the original
highlighters which are in the bigger
packaging these are the same size as the
luminous flush blushes or the mineral
blushes just wanted to let you guys know
but anyway let me go ahead and share
with you guys the shades I'm going to
start with the lightest and then work
into the darkest so the lightest one
that we do have here is my all-time
favorite this one is called pearl
flashes gold and as you guys can see it
is a beautiful beautiful kind of yellowy
pearly color and I want to share with
you guys really quickly side-by-side
swatches of that against like the
original pearl or the original
highlighters so right here we do have
pearl and then right underneath it we do
have pearl flashes gold now
over here I did also go ahead and swatch
moonstone I would say that this one is
the most comparable to the moonstone
shade but just so you know that is pearl
and there is pearl flashes gold alright
next in the lineup we do have rose
quartz of flashes seashell this is a
beautiful soft pink color I actually
preferred this color over the original
rose quartz if you didn't know rose
quartz was a limited edition highlight
that's sold out very very quickly but
this is just a beautiful beautiful color
right here we do have the original rose
quartz and right beneath it we have rose
quartz Flash's seashell so the original
rose quartz definitely has a little more
of a neutral toned pink color going on
rose quartz Flash's seashell is
definitely more of a baby pink or a cool
toned pink alright next we do have
champagne dream of flashes a Bellini
does anybody else find it kind of shady
that they couldn't call this champagne
pop flashes Bellini like why is that I
don't know but this is what a champagne
a dream that flashes Bellini looks like
and that is what I have on today as my
actual highlight if you do have a fair
complexion I would say these three that
I'm sharing with you right now are going
to be true highlights on you and then
the other three are going to be for
darker complexions but this is a
beautiful beautiful color as you can see
so right here we do have champagne a pop
if you are curious and then here is
champagne dream so again champagne pop
champagne dream they are pretty darn
similar but I would say champagne dream
is a lot lighter in tone which is great
again if you do have a fair complexion I
do not own a full size of champagne pop
because it's just too dark for me but I
really really do like this one alright
next we have this guide right here which
is called topaz flashes guilt this is
one that I am returning unfortunately
you guys although these do they say that
they are good as like eye shadow and as
actual highlight I find that these are
just a little too clumpy and it kind of
they just have too much fallout to
actually go on as an eye shadow so this
is definitely too dark for me as a
highlight which is why I'm returning it
but it is a very very interesting color
so I don't actually have the Topaz shade
in the original one to share a swatch
with you guys but this is what topaz um
let's see here taupe has a what is it
called topaz flashes guilt looks like so
it's a beautiful beautiful color as you
can see again if you do have like a
medium or deep complexion I think this
would be gorgeous on you and then the
next one we have is let's seek your opal
flashes Jade again I am returning this
one it just because I don't like it as
an eyeshadow and it's too dark for me to
be a true highlight but it's a very
interesting and intriguing shade reminds
me a little bit of the blue brown
pigment from a mac cosmetics so anyway
that is opal flashes Jade again I do not
have opal in full size so I can't give
you a swatch of that I will go ahead and
post these swatches right here on my
Instagram which I'll go ahead and link
down below in the description box if
you're curious but ya don't have those
do the rest of them I do have these side
by side swatches this one right here is
amethyst flashes geode and this is the
darkest this is the one that I use as a
blush I am actually keeping this one and
let me share with you the side by side
comparison here is prismatic amethyst
and here is amethyst flashes in geode so
again I will go ahead and post these
swatches down below if you would like to
see them side by side in a picture form
but yeah anyway let's go ahead and get
into the formula so the formula on these
is definitely not the same as the
original kind of like full sizes I say
full size cuz they're like the bigger
ones you know you're gonna go what IB
they have like the full eight grams in
there so I would say that these
definitely have a little more grit to
them they feel a little more foil to me
when I first got them there was a top
layer that I had to work off okay I
really really kind of had to dig in
there so I would highly recommend when
you first get them because there is that
firm a little layer go ahead and dig in
there now I feel like for $34 a piece
you really shouldn't have to do that
with a highlight that's just my opinion
I'm like why should I have to do that I
hate when I have to like scrape off that
top layer of a highlight I don't care if
it's two dollars or if it's $34 I feel
like I shouldn't have to do that because
I'm wasting product but I do feel like
once you kind of get in there they are a
lot more foil they are very very
pigmented now they don't feel as chalky
as the original highlighters and they
definitely do not feel as soft as the
original highlighters if you find that
the original um you know champagne pop
or the original pearl are little too
flaky and they're very very powdery to
you like when you put your brush in
there and you hate that you're probably
going to like this formula because they
do pick up nicely on a brush especially
if it's a little more of a densely
packed brush and they do apply it with a
lot more pigmentation in my opinion and
I think it's because they do have that
more foiled finish to them so overall I
would say that the formula is pretty
darn good now as far as where time is
concerned I would say these wear a lot
longer than the
original highlighters again it's
probably because they have that more
thick sort of feel to them they just
really adhere to the skin it beautifully
I've been wearing at this shade right
here which is champagne dream flashes
Bellini for about six hours now I did
set it in with setting spray but it just
feels like you're really kind of like
stamps onto the skin beautifully and I
love it the way that these sit on the
skin I do personally find that those
full-size highlighters from Becca
sometimes really do if I over apply them
they do emphasize texture fine lines
wrinkles it's not that they're glittery
and these are definitely not glittery as
well it's just that sometimes because
they are so powdery they just can kind
of emphasize the texture in that area
because these ones have that more foil
to finish I just don't notice that and I
love that when you tilt your head it's a
different colors which i think is so
darn cool so as far as where time is
concerned really really good now as far
as application is concerned you guys I
would say definitely going with a little
more of a densely packed brush something
that has a lot of full bristles in there
because these do have that more thicker
sort of formula you do need to kind of
scrape in there and I know you don't
have to do that with the original kind
of formula or the full size the eight I
didn't say eight fluid ounces
you know the eight gram pans but I would
say something like this like the
highlighting brush from ELF or anything
that you really can kind of just pick up
the product swirl in there tap off the
excess and then really get it onto your
cheeks and really blend back and forth
is going to be what you need to do and I
look for the guy right here at the elf
highlighting brush is new to me I'm not
in love with this I feel like it's a
little on the scratchy side but it's
very very densely packed and I feel like
it does pick up the product really
really nicely as you guys can see so
you're really kind of dig in there I
would tap off the excess again you don't
get too much powdery kick up which is
really nice because the other highlights
rebekah are sort of like very very
powdery in my opinion and then you just
take it and then you just kind of paint
it on or not paint it on but you know
what I mean you just kind of buff it
into the skin and I think it looks
really beautiful so overall I'm pretty
darn impressed with the formula although
these don't feel as soft and buttery I
still feel like they adhere to the skin
better they wear in longer time
throughout the day and I don't mind the
fact that they don't feel as soft I feel
like it's more about how they wear on
the face throughout the day and I think
that these look a lot more like skin
than the original Becca highlighters do
which is awesome so anyway let's go
ahead and do with these swatches of
these guys so we are going to start with
a pearl
flashes gold again this one is going to
be great if you do have a fair
complexion you guys can see when I
really kind of dig my finger in there do
you see how there's like a little bit of
texture it's not like powdery kick-up
it's just that it has a little bit of
texture so anyway here is pearl flashes
gold super super gorgeous next we're
going to do let's see here rose quartz
flashes sea shell again these three that
I'm going to share with you guys first
these are great if you do have a fair
complexion these will be a true
highlight on you they are not darker
than my skin which I adore so here is
rose quartz Flash's seashell absolutely
stunning and then the last one we have
is the one that I have on my cheeks
today which is champagne dream flashes
of Bellini and that looks a little
something like this this one has like a
orange creamsicle vibe to it I really
like it so if you are fair complected if
you have a medium complexion or even a
deep complexion these are going to work
on you I do think these might look not
like ashy on a really really deep
complexion but they might look a little
more pearl eyes does that make sense so
when you tilt your head in a different
direction they may just look a little
more pearly but I feel like if you do
have a fair complexion you're wondering
which one you should go for it
definitely one of these so there is
pearl flashes gold here is a rose quartz
flashes seashell and then here is
champagne dream flashes Bellini and
hopefully you guys can see the sort of
shift going on here it's not anything
that's super super unwearable the others
days I'm going to share with you guys in
a second might be a little more unique
or a little more unusual but these ones
right here are actually very wearable
and very beautiful alright next would
you have a topaz flashes guilt so like I
said I am returning this because you
guys I feel like even though they do
advertise these as eyeshadows /
highlighters these just don't we're an
incredibly long time on the eyes even
with a primer although these are
beautifully pigmented even when I foil
them I just don't get what I need I get
tons of fallout it's like a little pile
of dirt underneath my eyes I am NOT a
fan of that I'm not into that but this
one right here is a gorgeous shade so it
really has that gorgeous golden color to
it with a little bit of a greenish
bluish shift if you have a medium
complexion or deep complexion and you
want something a little more outside of
your comfort zone you should absolutely
get this the ole
a reason why I am returning it again is
not because it's not pigmented or
beautiful on the skin it's just I can't
wear it on my eyes I just don't want to
put that extra time and I don't want to
sit there and have to pack it onto my
lid for ages and then on top of that
obviously this can't really be a blush
topper it's just a little too much of an
unusual shade and for me it's obviously
way too dark to be a true highlight but
again if you have a medium complexion or
deeper you should try this out I am sure
it would be absolutely beautiful on your
skin tone so there is topaz flashes gilt
and then here we have the one that is
similar to Mac's a blue brown pigment in
my opinion this one is called opal
flashes Jade gorgeous like it's stunning
okay it's got this nice ashy sort of
color a little bit of like a champagne
thing going on but then it has like a
blue shift it kind of looks like a
bruise on my skin again I'm super super
pasty so you know this kind of stuff
just doesn't look good unless I wear it
as an eyeshadow but again I just don't
want to have to work that much for my
eyeshadow but it really is a pretty can
you guys see that this would work for I
would say even if you have a light
complexion if you're just maybe three or
four shades deeper than me you actually
probably could pull this off as a
highlight but it's just not the right
color for me I put it on and it doesn't
look right I was wearing it the other
day and I had a friend that was like
what what happened what happened to your
face it literally looks like a bruise
but it's gorgeous it's gorgeous again if
you do have a medium or deep complexion
I think it would work for you so there
they are and then finally we have this
guy right here which I have been using
as a blush so again I feel like these go
onto the cheeks really nicely they just
don't go on to the eye area nicely so
again I can use this as a blush I can
use it or I can use the other ones as
highlights and I feel like they go on
that nicely that way but this guy right
here is gorgeous so this is amethyst
flashes geode and it is just a gorgeous
cranberry sort of color but you have
that prismatic finish from it the actual
um you know prismatic amethyst shade so
there it is if you do have a really deep
skin tone this is going to be gorgeous
on you it has that nice cranberry pinky
sort of color to it really really liked
it so anyway there are all six hopefully
you guys can see them so over here are
the three that I would recommend for
those of you with a fair light or medium
complexion and then over here I would
recommend for light and medium and deep
complexions especially a deep complexion
if you have if you want to pick
this one or this one down here I would
say the middle shade right here would
actually work if you do have like I said
just a few shades darker of a skin tone
than I do but overall you guys I'm very
impressed with these I think they're
really beautiful do I think they can
double easily as an eyeshadow absolutely
not
I think they really are made for the
face they might not feel as soft and
buttery as some of the other products
that you can get from Becca but they
wear an incredibly long time they're
kind of interesting colors they're
beautiful they're a different take on
some of the other Becca highlighters so
if you feel like you have the other
Becca highlighters and everything seems
to be the same you know everybody
releases shades like that nowadays like
champagne colors really really icy
highlights you know deep kind of
chestnut II colors like they do with
like blush copper I would say go for one
of these absolutely you do not need to
pick up all six of them it's just not
necessary like I said I'm going to be
keeping four of them these guys right
here and then this one down here but
going store swatch them out see what
you're interested in I would recommend I
think these are good they get like a
four star rating for me absolutely so
anyway I hope this review it was helpful
thank you so much for joining me guys
and like I said I will have swatches
down below on my Instagram if you would
like to check that out and yeah that is
pretty much it I'll see you guys
tomorrow
