video is going to be a review swatches
and also a comparison on the new Becca
shimmering skin perfecter pressed in the
shade rose quartz I do have some
comparisons over here on my left side
these are again some other pink
highlighters that I have and then right
here towards the end of the video we
will also compare it against the other
shimmering skin perfecter Press that I
do have in my collection I purchased
this for $38 on the sephora.com website
you are getting seven grams of product
in here which is 1 gram less than what
you usually get in a shimmering skin
perfecter pressed right here I have my
Becca shimmering skin Perfector press in
the shade in moonstone these do have 8
grams of product in there and I'm
guessing this one has less because of
the actual consistency or finish on it
so it has that more like little prism
thing going on there I'm guessing that's
what it is I don't really know but I did
want to let you guys know there is only
7 grams of product in here this is new
this is a limited edition it is
currently sold out on the Sephora calm
website however I will leave a link down
below in the description bar where you
guys can go and be notified for email
whatever it's called we're basically so
far it will email you when the product
comes back in stock so this is a limited
edition creamy luminizing powder
highlighter that gives you the perfect
neutral pale pink that illuminates the
skin with a cool flawless finish and I
have to admit I have been waiting
forever for Rebecca to release a pink
highlighter I feel like Becca really
kind of sticks in that warm undertone
family or they tend to go with something
a little more like golden in color or in
tone so I was very very excited to see
that they have released like a nice pale
neutral pink color this doesn't lean too
warm and it also doesn't lean too cool I
think it's absolutely perfect and as
someone who does have fair skin with a
cool undertone I really was excited to
get this and this is what the outer
packaging looks like it is very
reminiscent of all of the other Becca
boxes as you guys can see and it just
shows you the amount of product that you
get on here and then this is what the
outer packaging looks like it is
absolutely to die for
you can see you have this nice pale pink
or rose gold thing going on on the
outside and then just the typical Becca
mirrored packaging little flying saucer
thing going on it is
different from some of their other
shimmering skin perfecter press that
just come up with this kind of like
matte dark gray color and I do think it
looks absolutely perfect paired together
with my Becca split pants that recently
released from the Jacqueline Hill
collection so really really love this
kind of mirrored pretty colored thing
that they have going on right now I hope
that they will keep coming out with
products like this so you open it up and
as you guys can see you have a nice
sized mirror here and this is what it
looks like on the inside this is the
first time that I have purchased a Becca
shimmering skin Perfector press that
does have a little bit of texture on it
or the top is not completely smooth and
I will say it is a little harder to pick
the products up I don't want to be too
nit picky but I did want to let you guys
know I do find it a little more
difficult to pick the product up and on
top of that you do get one less gram of
product in here because of the design
that is on the front I have to say right
away this is just absolutely beautiful
the color is absolutely fabulous if you
are someone who has a really neutral
undertone if you have a cool undertone
or a warm undertone that this is going
to work for you because it is just that
nice and neutral pale pink shade I think
that the formulation is exactly what you
would expect from a Becca shimmering
skin Perfector and when I say that I
mean the ones that you expect in a
full-size I know there are some
discrepancies between the ones that come
in full-size and the ones that come in
certain palettes like I have the Becca
Jaclyn hill palette here I have this one
from last year as well and I do think
there is a noticeable difference between
the consistency I do feel like they
apply the same way the ones that come in
the palette they do apply the same way
on the face as the ones that come in a
full-size but I will say they do feel a
little scratchier to the touch this has
pretty much the identical same
formulation and I believe it has the
same exact ingredients list as all of
their other shimmering skin perfecter
press it's just absolutely beautiful
this beautiful neutral kind of pale pink
color you do have the tiniest amount of
like a gold or silver sheen in here I
can't even really put my finger on it
because it's just so neutral so you're
getting a golden sheen and a golden and
I'm sorry a golden sheen and a silver
sheen mixed into just a beautiful rose
base and I think it's absolutely
stunning the one shade that I wish I did
have this to compare it to you is that
rose gold shade unfortunately I do not
have that one the shimmering skin
perfecter press
that I do own in a full-size are pearl
moonstone I have champagne pot Prosecco
pop are not in a full-size I have that
one in a palette and then now I have
rose quartz and then I also have the
shade blushed copper but as you guys can
see I really really have to say I cannot
find anything in my collection that
quite looks like this color if you are
curious that this is the rose quartz
shade right here and we'll go through a
little more in comparisons but I pulled
out all of my neutral or pink
highlighters and this is completely
completely unique so I'm very happy that
I got it if you're not familiar with the
shimmering skin perfecter press
formulation they're very soft very very
buttery one of my favorite ways to apply
these is definitely with some sort of a
tapered highlighter brush that is how I
applied it today on my face this is the
Sigma tapered highlighter f-35 and I
really like the way that this goes in
and kind of picks up the product if you
are unfamiliar these are very very
pigmented and they are quite soft but
that means that they do have a little
bit of kick up and I do find it harder
with this particular pattern on top to
kind of pick up the product evenly
without having to really really go in
there because then you know the more
that you kind of rub your brush in there
the more fallout you do get but I will
say the formulation is absolutely
beautiful
besides the powdery finish it's really
gorgeous it stays on the cheeks for a
very long time
I personally notice which shimmering
skin perfecter press that they were a
lot longer if I'm wearing either a
hydrating primer or a really tacky
primer any time I wear a silicone primer
they usually only last about eight hours
on at my cheeks but anytime I am wearing
a sticky or tacky formulation that like
of a primer basically they will last up
to 12 hours on my cheeks so wear time is
great I think they're very soft a very
buttery they look beautiful on the skin
they can be a little overdone so make
sure that you don't like really really
build it up today I just have one layer
of this highlight on I think it looks
very beautiful very flaky and I just
don't think that these highlighters look
particularly good if you really do layer
layer layer because they will start to
emphasize fine lines and wrinkles and
also just checks texture on your skin so
make sure you just kind of go in with
maybe like one or one and a half layers
anything further than two layers I think
in my opinion starts to make my skin
looked a little more aged but anyway
really beautiful highlighter love the
color if you are someone who does have
any
sort of undertone I think he would
absolutely adore this and I do want to
say I think that this will show up on
every single skin tone it is a little
darker than my particular skin tone but
that doesn't mean that it can't give you
a glow so if you have very very dark
skin this will work for you it's gonna
look a little more pearly on your skin
and maybe a little more of like a white
base but if you have super super fair
skin like I do then yes you're gonna get
that beautiful rosy color on your cheeks
but it also is not going to be too dark
and when you turn your head in certain
light it's not going to darken up if
that makes sense so it still will make
you really really beautiful and glowy
and I think that it's perfect for all
skin tones so anyway let's go ahead and
I'm going to show you guys the
comparisons that I have over here of the
other Becca shimmering skin perfecter
press the first shade that I have on top
is pearl the second one I have here is
moonstone then I have No
then I have a champagne pop and then I
have rose quartz this one right here is
Prosecco pop and then this one over here
is blushed copper so I would say the one
that it is most similar to I mean if I
had to pick it's completely different
but I guess champagne pop has a little
bit of the same sort of undertone since
it does have a little bit of that rosy
thing going on but for the most part
this is completely different than any
other Becca shimmering skin perfecter
Press that I personally own I do not own
opal in the powder form but I did swatch
it in the cream form or the poured form
I did go ahead and swatch that next to
it earlier again doesn't look anything
like it so this is very very unique to
the Becca collection I think it's
absolutely beautiful again I do wish
that I had rose gold so that I could
swatch it next to that one you guys but
I'm sorry I do not and then over here I
went ahead and I did a little comparison
and some swatches of other pink
highlighters that I have the first one i
swatch was the Dior nude air glowing
gardens powder highlighter in 0:01
glowing pink which is my all-time
favorite highlighter and that is the one
that we have up here and then the second
one that i swatched is Rebecca rose
quartz and I was so surprised because
this kind of darkens up a little bit on
the skin when you swatch it it looks
different when you do apply to the
cheekbones it's a lot lighter but it
looks so dark complete compared to what
my glowing gardens do you guys see that
so the nude air glowing gardens
definitely has more of a white base and
then this
definitely has more of that neutral pink
thing going on the one that I would say
it's the closest to is actually this
color right here which is from laura
geller this is the baked gelato swirl
illuminator in the shade peach glow and
this one obviously has more of a peach
undertone but I would say when i
swatched them next to each other that is
actually the one that I think is the
closest out of all of my favorite
cool-toned or just pink highlighters in
general the next one that we have
underneath this particular one is
actually from the brand let me see here
urban decay and this is the urban decay
afterglow a tower powder highlighter in
the shade Ora again this one definitely
has more of a white tone as you guys can
see it's a lot more similar to thank you
or glowing garden so here is rose quartz
there is Ora they are not similar
whatsoever and then the last one that we
have down here is the other Laura Geller
fake gelato swirl illuminator and this
is in the shade charming pink which
again has a little bit of that white
undertone so it's very very funny to see
I guess that the Laura Geller's would
definitely be the closest match to the
becca rose quartz but for the most part
I actually think this one which is
called peach glow is the most similar to
the rose quartz so if you were wondering
about those other highlighters they are
definitely a lot more kind of milky and
I would say more cool toned than the
becca rose quartz which is truly just
like a very nice neutral color so anyway
I hope you guys enjoyed this review and
swatches in comparison I think this is
an absolutely beautiful powder
illuminator I love the way it looks on
the skin it's very very pretty very
stunning very very gorgeous and I just
think it gives a beautiful neutral wash
of color or highlight to the face so
thank you so much for joining me guys I
hope you enjoyed this like I said and I
will see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
