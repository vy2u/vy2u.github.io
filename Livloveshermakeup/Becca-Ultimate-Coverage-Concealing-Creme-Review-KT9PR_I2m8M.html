be doing a review on the new Becca
ultimate coverage concealing creme this
is what it looks like it retails for I
believe let me see it yes thirty two
dollars on the Sephora website and my
color is praline which is a fair beige
with neutral undertones that says on the
website it looks like this it's a pretty
good color match I like it because it
has a little bit of yellow undertones in
it um I really thought I was going to be
using this for under the eye but I will
let you guys know what I think of that
in a minute but um let me read for you
guys what it says on the website again
this is $32 on the Sephora website I
will link the link below so you guys can
find it um it says it is a richly
pigmented weightless concealing cream
that completely covers dark circles
imperfections redness and
hyperpigmentation
it says this long wearing full coverage
concealer is formulated to cover dark
circles and perfections redness and
hyperpigmentation completely this cream
delivers a uniquely lightweight formula
with a high concentration of pigments
and emollients for undetectable crisp
roof coverage without a sticky or cakey
feel um it is free of parabens and what
else you need to know the product
appears perfectly with Becca under-eye
brightening corrector to conceal so this
is not the under eye corrector this is
the concealer so let me just first say I
do think that this cover is anything
that you really want it to cover it is
so so pigmented so creamy but honestly
it's a very a very happy I know it says
on there that it's not supposed to be
sticky or tacky I find it to be
completely sticky and tacky but that's
what makes it so good because it really
sticks to the skin and everything that
you need it to conceal - as you can see
it really does blend out kind of nicely
but it is hard to blend this thing is
hard to blood I cannot even stress it
enough it is just really really thick
and tacky and very hard to blend I
blended I am Reina today by the way I
put it on my eyelid under my eyes and on
any areas that I need to cover up and it
does cover beautifully I have like a
birthmark up here that it completely
covered it completely covered my acne
scars it's gorgeous it's perfect for
covering
it really gives awesome coverage but the
thing is is that it is really hard to
blend I am NOT going to return it I do
want to keep it because I do like it for
other areas but under my eyes and on my
eyelids oh my goodness I don't want to
be pulling and tugging at my eyelid or
under my eye you know I don't want to be
causing premature wrinkles and just all
that kind of stuff so this was a no-go
for when it comes to under the eye and
the eyelid which I'm kind of
disappointed about because I kind of got
one with a little bit of a yellow base
because I thought it would really help
cancel out under the eye like bags so
now you feel like you know I almost
don't even have the right shade but I am
still happy with it um I applied it over
my foundation and it really did look
beautiful and especially like my acne
scars here and things like that
they're just not as noticeable and it's
just I really have this to thank for it
so really really love it for its hihi
concealer powers it really does cover
everything that it needs to cover
however it is really hard to blend I'm
not happy with that and I don't think
anybody wants to be pulling at their eye
or anywhere on their face but when you
want to cover it up on your skin if you
have an imperfection on your skin other
than your eye you can just dab it on and
then I took my Beauty Blender and just
Pat over it and it totally did a nice
job so I'm really really happy with that
let's see this is the packaging that it
comes in let me see if there's anything
else on this little packaging that you
need to know um it basically just said
says what it says oh here it says to
prevent product from drying out keep Kap
tightly closed so I did not see that
before but I can see why they would say
that as you guys can see it's really
really creamy so it's this dried out it
would probably be the worst product ever
because it's so heavy coverage it would
just kick up immediately so definitely
definitely keep the lid really really
tightly closed um what else does staying
here it looks like one of the first
ingredients which is kind of cool is
castor seed oil so instead of like you
know some kind of paraben or something
like that it's nice that they have some
oils in here it doesn't look like there
is
it looks pretty good the ingredient list
looks pretty clean and yeah so it
doesn't really say anything different on
the packaging I look and what it said on
the website but overall I am happy with
it I will not return it I did get it for
a different purpose I thought it would
help with under eye and my eyelid also
if you guys can tell my shadow looks a
little bit like it's skipped today and
that's also from this it's so sticky and
tacky that I couldn't really I basically
used it as an eye primer um and I could
not get my shadows over it properly so
that's another reason I will not be
using it near my eyes or under my eyes
however it is wonderful for covering
things that you want to disappear on
your face so I would say I give this
like a 7 out of a 10 it's not what I
thought I would use it for however I'm
really really happy with the coverage
and you know I was gonna say consistency
but that's not true the consistencies
commissary um even though it is very
very creamy it's just it's a very tacky
and I don't know I don't know if I love
that but that's what it has to be if
it's gonna have those really high
coverage benefits so anyway I hope you
guys enjoyed this I will leave the link
below from where I got it and I'll see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
