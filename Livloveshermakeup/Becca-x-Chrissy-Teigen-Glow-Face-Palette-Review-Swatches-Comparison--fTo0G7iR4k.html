my channel today's video is going to be
a review swatches in comparison on the
view a Becca cosmetics glow palettes
collaboration with Chrissy Teigen so I
did pick mine up for forty six dollars
on the Sephora comm website it is
currently out of stock but it will be
available again on the sephora.com
website tomorrow I have heard that a few
people have been able to pick this up at
their JC Penney stores inside of Sephora
and also on like not in the all TOCOM
website but in store at Ulta I thought
that this was supposed to be a Sephora
exclusive they claim this limited
edition you guys know how I feel about
limited edition palette who knows what
this will actually be limited edition
I'm sure in like a month it will be
permanent anyway it claims that it is a
limited edition and if you guys are
curious becca is a cruelty free brand
which is why i purchased this and this
whole palette is formulated without
sulfates so if you were curious as to
what you get on the inside here this is
what it looks like you are getting a 5.1
grams of the shimmering skin perfecter
press in rose gold and beech nectar so
rose gold is the shade right here and
this one is permanent to the Becca line
and then beech nectar is a new limited
edition exclusive shade to this
particular palette you are getting two
point four grams of the luminous blush
blush in the shade hibiscus bloom that
is what it looks like I will be doing a
little comparison against the
Pomplamoose shade as well as snapdragon
from the permanent lines for you guys
and then also you are getting two point
four grams of these sunlit bronzer in
the shade malibu Soleil and that is that
one right there I believe that they will
be coming out with a full-size of that
if you guys are curious I do also have
for the comparison part of this video
two different sunlit bronzers in full
sizes to go ahead and share with you
guys I will go ahead and throw up in my
cards my video that I did on these but
yeah basically I was very excited for
this palette for one reason and one
reason only my all-time favorite face
palette you guys is the Becca Jaclyn
Hale champagne collection face palette I
know that a lot of the products from the
champagne collection were a huge mess I
hated the little eye sticks I really
didn't like the eye shadow palettes but
this and the split pans were very very
good quality
now this particular face palette was
definitely limited edition and I just
love it I use the living out of
this palette you guys seriously so this
is what it looks like as you can see you
have Prosecco pop champagne pop down
here you have Pomplamoose which is a
mineral blush it's kind of like a satiny
blush in the middle you do have amaretto
which again is one of their mineral
blushes and then you have the Shea
Rosi spritz which is one of their
luminous flesh blushes so when I saw
that this was releasing I thought
immediately you know what it looks very
very similar to that and that is why I
scooped it up I am happy to say that
they are very similar so if you were
never able to get your hands on the
Jacqueline Hale palette or if you loved
it as much as I do and you want a backup
this is very very similar
now if you did pick that Jacqueline Hill
palette up and you really didn't like it
this is going to be something you're
probably not going to enjoy either I
feel like the formula is pretty darn
simpler what I noticed with this is that
these are a little more firmly pressed
now some people might really like that
because the Beca products in general
tend to be very very powdery I will say
the shimmering skin perfectors in here
Beach nectar as well as Rose Gold's the
highlighter I feel like those are still
quite powdery you have to tap off the
excess you know with your brush but the
other two are quite firmly press now I'm
not a huge fan of that I'm kind of like
a consistency snob like I really really
like the feel like a nice soft touch but
these go onto the face absolutely
beautifully and if you're worried about
them being too dark for a fair
complexion I'm wearing them today I'm
even self tanned right now I have tried
these without to being self tan I just
put like a new layer of self-tanner on
last night and I feel like they actually
go into the skin quite nicely now none
of these if you do have a fair
complexion just for a little bit of
reference I'm anywhere from like an NC w
NC w NZ r NW 10 to 15 right now probably
about an NW or NC 15 with my tan and
none of these are actually highlighters
on me so the beach nectar shade as well
as the rose gold shade definitely are
not highlighters but I do have them on
today as actual blush Stoppers or
blushes and they're actually really
beautiful so if you never got your hands
on the Jaclyn hill palette this is a
very very close similar kind of thing
going on here I do feel like it's a
little on the expensive side I don't
know why but I feel like the Jaclyn hill
palette was actually cheaper than 46
dollars and you got more product in it
but like I said this is second best if
you wanted to scoop that palette up and
you never got your hands on it so I know
a lot of people are saying again that
this is definitely kind of for people
who have a more medium complexion to a
deeper complexion I actually think it's
going to work for a lot of different
complexions like I said when I first got
it and I was kind of swatching it I was
thinking oh these feel a little
sandpaper e they feel a little rough to
the touch but they go on to the face
absolutely beautifully if you were
curious as to what I have on today I
have only shaded beach and nectar and
this one right here which is called
hibiscus
I have those on as my actual blush and
then I did take a little bit of this guy
right here the nectar shade I put that
on down the bridge of my nose you guys
can probably see there's a little bit of
shadowing going on there it's just a
little too dark for my liking but then
today I also put this on at my eyes I
actually took the shade rose gold I work
that into the crease
I took hibiscus bloom put that on the
lower lash line I took the beach nectar
put that on my lid and then I took
Malibu Soleil and worked that into the
outer V using all of like my cheap
little elf brushes here so I used envy
let's see here well this guy right here
is the beauty eyes brush from tease I've
used that to kind of smoke out that
lower lashline color then I took my elf
professional blending brush for my
crease BH Cosmetics to blend it out and
then for my face I actually used a new
elf brush that I picked up this is the
flawless face brush and I feel like this
actually applied all of this product
really really beautifully the one
product in here that I'm still kind of
unsure about and the one that I like the
least is probably the bronzer the
bronzer runs a little too dark for me
when I applied it today kind of look
like someone had punched me in the face
it looked like kind of like a bruise on
me and it has a very very interesting
undertone like almost more yellow toned
I am somebody who does pull a very very
cool tone so I definitely prefer the
amaretto shade from this particular
palette um although the amaretto shade
is technically supposed to be a blush I
use it as a bronzer because it's
beautiful
has a nice pinky kind of undertone but
yeah that's really the only thing in
this palette that I'm not impressed with
I think these go onto the face so much
better than they swatch basically and
when you feel them they feel a little
crispy they do not feel like the full
sizes that you would get in say like a
shimmering skin perfecter press like
when I put my finger in here it feels
different than the Jaclyn hill palette
it feels different to them this Chrissy
Teigen palette but still really really
good the pigmentation is good I do feel
like becca is starting to change up
there for me a little bit a little bit
so that things aren't as powdery as they
used to be that's pretty much
everybody's like made request is that
you know the shadow really easily
they're too powdery so I feel like this
particular palette these are a little
more firmly pressed so if you are not a
fan of that powdery mess that usually
happens with Becca products you'd
probably like this and yeah pretty much
just overall quite impressed you guys I
would give it 3.5 out of 5 stars I'm
definitely gonna keep it in my
collection so anyway can we just take a
moment to actually look at this
packaging so it's this beautiful rose
gold effect it does having names on the
back and I just love this like I thought
I'd love to be Jacqueline halo packaging
which I still do but this is amazing -
it does have that little layer of like
rubber thing going on here so if you
dig your finger in there which feels
really tempting and wonderful and I want
to dig in there don't do it but if you
do it will leave a mark
I mean if you guys can see it does say
Becca and then Chrissy right there and I
love Chrissy Teigen I think she's so
gorgeous she has a beautiful beautiful
glow on her cheeks all the time you have
a huge sized mirror here and it does not
tilt back all the way so you can just
keep it and it will stay upright which
is great for travel and I really like
that this can double as an eyeshadow
palette so anyway let's go ahead and
jump into some comparison and swatches I
am going to start with this shade right
here which is the rose gold shade so
this is the shimmering skin perfecter
press in the shade rose gold I'm going
to swatch that on top so here is what it
looks like really really beautiful as
you guys can see like I said these are a
little more firmly pressed and I don't
feel like I'm getting as much powdery
chunkiness and although they don't feel
as smooth they still go onto the skin
really really beautifully so that is a
gorgeous color if you do have a medium
or dark complexion this is going to be a
great highlight on you in my opinion
next we do have the beautiful and nectar
I keep wanting to call it nectar blossom
Beach nectar shimmering skin perfecter
now this is like this reminds me a lot
of from me personally like the luminous
flush blush formula which I do have two
full sizes of those I can wear this by
itself as an actual blush on my fair
skin so there is the shade Beach nectar
really really really beautiful so now
what I'm going to do is go ahead and
swatch champagne pop and Prosecco pop
from the Jacqueline Hale apology you
guys can see these side by side with
these so here is the shade of champagne
pop and then here is Prosecco pop both
of these are permanent to the Becca line
now if you guys are curious so on top we
have champagne pop and then on the
bottom we will have Prosecco pop so you
guys can instantly see there's a little
more pigment going on with this palette
and there was the Jaclyn hill and these
are definitely deeper in tone so here is
the Chrissy Teigen and here is the Becca
alright moving on let's go ahead and
swatch out the blush in here so this one
everybody keeps saying it looks so so so
incredibly similar to the Pomplamoose
shade from the Becca Jaclyn hill palette
it definitely is very similar this is
not the normal luminous flush of blush
formula in my opinion I actually feel
like this is more like their mineralized
blushes I do have quite a few like I
said of their full sizes of the luminous
flush and it does remind me a lot of the
snapdragons shade as well so I am going
to take that right here
and I'm going to swatch that one from
the palace you guys can see it's really
just a nice like hot coral kind of shade
like I said I do have this on at my
actual face today then we will take
Snapdragon which is from the permanent
collection and then we will go ahead and
take Pomplamoose from the Jacqueline
Hale palette and you guys will be able
to see very very similar all three of
them so how do you interesting that they
call that one like a luminous flush
because I feel like the Snapdragon one
is truly a luminous flush but they all
have like a little bit of color going on
there so here is the Chrissy Teigen
palette here is the staff dragon single
from the luminous blush formula and here
is Pomplamoose from the Jaclyn hill
palette very very similar you're not
going to be able to see a difference
when you put these on your cheeks so
again if you already have the Jacqueline
teal palette and you just want one of
them you definitely don't need to pick
this one up alright moving on let's go
ahead and swatch the bronzer shade so
I'm going to take this one from the
Chrissy Teigen palette I keep forgetting
the name of this what is it it is called
Malibu Soleil so there it is and what
I'm going to do is actually go ahead and
swatch that next to the full-size sunlit
bronzers that I have I believe that this
is going to be in the actual permanent
collection but I have to say this
particular one from the Chrissy Teigen
palette does not remind me of the
full-size formulation I just wanted to
let you guys know
here is the shade of Bali Sands from the
full-size we'll go ahead and swatch that
really really nice if you do have a fair
complexion like I said I'll link my
video above where I compared these to
the actual Physicians Formula
Muro Muro butter bronzers and then we
have Capri coast so here is the Chrissy
Teigen palette here is Bali Sands here
is Capri coast really good pigmentation
here but it just goes on a little patchy
err in my opinion and then let's take
the shade amaretto from the Jap lineal
palette this one like I said has a
little more of a cooler undertone to it
and it definitely is different than the
shade from the Chrissy Teigen palette so
there is the Chrissy Teigen there is the
Jacqueline right here we have Capri
coast in full-size and then there is
Bali Sands so there they are
alright so those are all of the colors
in the Chrissy Teigan at palettes like I
said I think it's a really beautiful
palette I want to go ahead and swatch
all of them side by side really quickly
for you guys here just so you can see
all of them in a nice lineup I'll just
do one swipe swatches here but overall
really similar color layout to the
actual Jaclyn heel
Hallet like I said if you already have
it and you don't want like a backup or a
kind of simpler palette to that there's
no need to get it but yeah very very
happy impressed with the formula
impressed with the quality like I said
it's just when I kind of dig my fingers
in there I don't feel like it feels very
smooth and soft to the touch but it's
not really about how it feels you know
it's about how it performs on the actual
face so here is the Jacqueline heel here
is the Chrissy Teigan palette so anyway
guys and that is my review swatches in
comparison I hope you enjoyed this video
I definitely think it's worth picking up
if you never got your hands on the
Jaclyn hill palette but overall joy I
think it's a necessity in your
collection know you can probably find a
lot of face palette similar to this but
for me personally I really like it I'm
going to keep it around so again thank
you for joining me and I'll see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
