this video I have a review and swatches
for you guys on the new Becca Jaclyn
hill champagne collection eyeshadow
palettes this retails for $40 on the
Sephora comm website this is the outer
packaging it just a really nice of gold
box with little tiny white champagne
bubbles and a little tribute to Jaclyn
hill herself on the back this is
currently sold out but it will be
available online and in store again on
June 16 2016 so if you are not able to
pick up the eyeshadow palette or even
the face palette - both of these will be
available again on June 16th 2016 so
anyway that is the outer packaging and
then the actual packaging oh you guys I
just love the packaging for this whole
collection so we have this sort of
mirrored acrylic thing here and then we
have the little champagne white bubbles
we have a sticker on the back with the
names of all five shadows we have a nice
little clip closure and I like to say
and we have a gorgeous little mirror in
here that does span the entire palate
and here are your five eyeshadow shades
and I just want to say really really
quickly I am NOT going to be able to
give you guys a comparison against any
other eyeshadow palettes from Becca this
is actually my first eyeshadow palette
from Becca my first time experiencing
the formulation so I just wanted to put
that out there right away if you were
curious if this was similar to like
their ombre or ombre Rouge palettes I
have absolutely no idea this is just
kind of my first thoughts on the actual
you know finishes and the actual
pigmentation the whole the whole shebang
I'm just kind of my thoughts on what the
actual eyeshadows are like from Becca I
feel like Becca is very well known for
their face products especially their
shimmering skin perfectors they really
really have a wonderful formulation to
them and so do their blushes I think
they're extremely pigmented but you
don't hear them or you don't hear about
them as much like for their eyeshadows
if that makes sense so I was excited to
try this out not only to of course
support Jaclyn but also because I really
wanted to try out the formulation so
anyway the formulation is interesting on
these so we have two shades here and
they basically describe these on the
website as Luster's or shimmers and then
these three shades right here are
supposed to be matched now in my opinion
these two shades this one is Chardonnay
and this one is champagne toast those
are more like a foil of eyeshadow and
then this shade right here which is kind
of like a transition transition shade or
color this is cordial I feel like that
is actually more of a satin sort of
finish to because it just glides on so
beautifully it's not the tiniest tiniest
amount of Sheen like when you swatch it
you can't even tell but when you're
putting it on it just really really goes
on nicely and then the two shades here
cognac which is my favorite shade and I
point to get that right there cognac
which is this beautiful sort of burnt
orange e warm color that is my favorite
shade and I just think the best formula
out of all of these is honestly I don't
know what it is but this just seems to
have a really buttery matte sort of
consistency to it it blends like a dream
I have it on my lower lash line today I
just I love that color
and then we have this shade right here
which is Bordeaux and this is also a
matte I am not really my favorites in
the palette I would say my least
favorite shade for sure is Chardonnay I
have some issues with that just like
taking up on my eyelids I think the
formulation is a little strange on the
sort of foiled or shimmering shades
they're just a little thick and a little
too um they're just a little too
textured if that makes sense but anyway
definitely I think the palette is
beautiful it's definitely one of those
one size fits all sort of palettes
because of course they just released one
so they need to make sure that they are
catering to every single skin tone as
they fair complected girl well I am
range self tanner today I don't know
but as they fair complected girl I will
say I can wear every single shadow in
here and it shows up on my skin tone and
I think if you do have really really
deep skin the only shades that probably
wouldn't show up on you are probably is
the transition shade but everything else
would be really really good so I think
that you know some people are saying on
the support website that the colors are
so basic and I'm kind of agree like when
I opened it I was like okay I could
probably do a lot of these colors in my
collection however you have to think
about it from the standpoint that they
are really trying to cater to you know a
crowd of people and I think that they
were smart for doing this so anyway the
pigmentation on these shadows is really
really nice with the two sort of foiled
eyeshadows it's crazy the pigment
is super super opaque but again they
have that sort of thick consistency to
them and I don't know what it is they
just really really ball up on my eyelids
I like to wear these because they are
sort of shimmering I think they're
beautiful like on the inner corner of
the eye on the eyelid
I do have Chardonnay on the inner corner
of my eye right now in champagne toast
on my lid and I already have creasing
and it is starting to kind of get stuck
into little fine lines and wrinkles on
my eyelids now I am wearing it the elf
of glitter glue on this eye today and
then the Too Faced shadow insurance
glitter glue on this side so I feel like
I had the same amount of creasing if not
maybe a little more on this one with the
Too Faced I feel like I have the same
amount of creasing on each side and
those are glitter glue so those are
really really tacky eyes shadow primer
so I'm just surprised that the
formulation on the two of these are just
so thick and not really workable one
thing I will say about every single
shadow in here is that I find that they
just pick up too much product right away
whether you're swatching it when I show
you guys the swatches I have to build
them up because they go on a little
streaky you guys will see what I mean no
matter what the finish they go on and
they sort of have just too much product
too much product comes off on your
finger the same exact thing happens with
your brush so you need to go ahead and
tap off the excess for every single
shade with these two sort of foiled
shadows the Chardonnay and champagne
toast
oh my god fallout 2 galore so make sure
to go ahead and do your eyes first and
then your face or at least have a fluffy
brush so that you can pick up your
makeup crumbs because they really do
have quite a bit of Fallout especially
the shade right here champagne toast
which is just a bummer because it's so
beautiful and I really thought I was
going to be similar to like the L'Oreal
infallible the little what's it called
amber rush eyeshadows single it has even
more follow-up than that and that has a
lot of fallout so yeah I was kind of
surprised I have tried using these with
a little bit of a setting spray like
sprayed my brush first and then applying
them they go on really foiled that way
and I feel like it does kind of help
with the thickness like the texture so
it helps to send them out a little bit
but I also just find that they just look
so over the top if you do apply it that
way
and I feel like because this is such a
neutral palette for the most part I want
to create neutral lips with it of course
you can do whatever you want with it you
really can make any of these shadows pop
if you do spray a little bit of like max
it mac fix+
or any sort of setting spray onto your
brush but for the most part I just think
this is such a beautiful like basic sort
of palette so anyway like I said I do
have this shade right here
cognac on my lower lash line today it is
my favorite color it's just warm it's
beautiful I love the way it blends it
seems to just have a different
formulation to it than the other
eyeshadows and earrings seriously I
don't even know why I don't understand
but it does and then I do have a little
bit of Bordeaux on the outer V of my eye
and it's nice I like the way that these
three shades right here the cordial
cognac and Bordeaux I like the way that
those blend I like the way that they
layer they kinda start to look a little
muddled together if you over blend so
just make sure that you're just kind of
like stamping the product on and then
just doing a little bit of blending I
love when you don't have to over blend
eyeshadows you guys know I hate blending
eyeshadow so I think that's great so i
unquiet fan of the three shades over
here these on the other hand I feel like
you know you do have to blend quite a
bit I think the one thing that's kind of
missing in here would have been like a
nice matte brown shade so they're really
only giving you this Chardonnay shade
which has that strong yellow undertone
and I do have that underneath my brow
today and it's just like I mean I really
had to blend it out and I feel like when
you're putting on like a brow bone color
you shouldn't have to blend it should
just be a nice matte color that you just
sweep on there and I just felt like
there was just chunkiness it was
starting to get down into this area
starting to make this little like flap
of skin look kind of textured it was
super strange I love it on the inner
corner of the eye even just like right
on the first third of like my eyelid I
think it's pretty but for the most part
I feel like this is really hard to pull
off like on your brow if that makes
sense underneath your brow bone it's
just a little too much and it's a little
too like a wham bam in your face I feel
like a lot of the shades in here are so
neutral it just doesn't really work so I
would have loved to see just like a
matte uhm a matte color you know right
here or a matte finish I should say this
color but in a matte finish I do like
that has an interesting sort of yellow
undertone which i think is quite
brightening but yeah I just wish it was
Matt anyway the staying power on these
darn good I have tried them with several
primers like I said I do prefer to use
them with like a bullet or glue
something that has a really tacky base I
know the Mac Paint Pots I also do have a
tacky base so maybe that would be a good
option as well I didn't like them with
my Maybelline long-lasting eyeshadow
base in five ten which is more of like a
smooth sort of creamy satiny consistency
I did like the way that they stayed on
with that particular eye primer but my
ELF primer and a few others these didn't
really last too long now these three
shades right here the three that are
kind of like satiny mattes those
definitely last a lot longer I would say
7 to 8 hours on the eyes whereas these
guys start to break up and they just
start to like get stuck in fine lines
around your eyelid and they start to
kind of crease they just start creasing
like crazy I don't know how else to
describe it even with glitter glue they
just start to crease so I would say the
lasting power on those two shades is
only about 3 to 4 hours for me
personally I do have rather oily eyelids
so maybe that's something to think about
but with a glitter glue I feel like that
shouldn't happen so anyway overall I do
think that this is a good palette I hope
you guys don't think I'm sitting here
like a piece of crap I'm definitely not
saying that I'm just saying in general
from the whole champagne collection
standpoint if you are really excited
about this collection you want to
support Jaclyn I would highly recommend
checking out the face palette I feel
like this is so versatile and nice for
so many different skin tones you're
getting lovely colors in here and it's
$52 you know you're not getting nearly
as much product in here and this is $40
and I feel like I really could find
dupes for every single shade in this
palette in my you know I don't even know
drum store eye palette drawer and also
my high-end eye palette drawer I just
feel like it is easily duped I do like
it because I feel like it is very travel
friendly I actually think I am going to
carry this in my purse because it's just
a nice palette to have for touch-ups you
know you do have a nice variety of
shades that are neutral and if you
wanted to throw you know some eyeshadow
on with your finger you could do so with
this palette but for them
most parts I think that the standout in
this collection is definitely the face
palette so when these do release on June
16th again I would highly recommend
checking out the face palette not to say
that I'm disappointed with this at all
because I'm not I'm definitely going to
keep it I just wish that the formula was
a little more consistent with the
shadows if that makes sense and again I
have never tried any back of shadows so
I can't compare them to anything else
but I just feel like there's just a
little bit of hits and misses if that
makes sense I do find that these
actually swatch a lot worse than they go
on the eyes so they actually look a lot
better on the eyes than they do in
swatches and when I started watching
this at first I was like oh my god like
I don't think I'm gonna like this at all
but they really go on to the eyes are
very very nicely so anyway let's go
ahead and start watching this baby we're
gonna start with Chardonnay which is my
least favorite not because of the color
just because of the consistency now can
you guys see these two shades here you
see how there's like a little dense
already in there I mean what like I
haven't Ella for like two days so this
is what it looks like when you dig your
finger in there and I'm not saying like
dig I just kind of swirled it around we
have a lot of fall up and has come up
and immediately I kind of think of like
a makeup forever artist shadow or like a
makeup geek foiled eyeshadow when I look
at it like this and then I swatch it and
I realize it doesn't go on seamlessly it
gets chunky so let me show you guys just
one swipe there it is
so as you can see we have some dragging
here and it just got a little patchy
it's just got patchy and if you see up
close there are tiny little you know
it's a product that got balled up so now
you know I'm really gonna rub here and
we're gonna make it so that it gets nice
and blended out but I mean I feel like
especially for something that's foiled
like this when you're putting it on your
lid you just wanted to swipe it on and
it should go on so nicely and I don't
like to have to sit there and like blend
my eyelid color I just feel like for a
foiled eyeshadow or something that has
like a lot of luster or sheen to it it
just shouldn't do that so anyway here is
Chardonnay it's a beautiful color it is
sort of like it's kind of like
kind of like Becca's moonstone
shimmering skin perfecter it's got a
beautiful opalescent yellow undertone to
it and sort of like a champagne sort of
color now I don't know if you guys can
see this but it just looks slightly
drying on my hand and I feel like for my
lids it looks a little better I do have
sort of oily eyelids but I don't know do
you guys see what I'm seeing I'm just
not impressed when I swapped this like I
said it does go onto the eyes a little
better but it's the same powers just so
poor for this particular formulation
like the first two shades all right next
we're gonna go ahead and swatch a
champagne toast and champagne toast is
just a beautiful sort of rose gold color
again when I just put my finger in there
let me show you guys a lot of product
starts to kick up alright so there is
champagne toast again there's a little
bit of texture going on there and here
it is when I just do one swipe look at
all of that so that's what I mean when I
say like you're gonna get fallout if you
put these on your eyelids you want to do
you know your eye makeup first and then
go in with your face makeup because you
will get fallout so there is Chardonnay
there's champagne toast don't get me
wrong once it is blended out it is
absolutely stunning I love it it's got
sort of a copper undertone with like a
rose gold sort of hue to it alright so
now we're gonna get into the sort of
that satin shade it's called cordial and
there it is and it's beautiful this is
like the best transition shade ever I
really like the feeling on this this
just feels super super light and airy
and I just feel like I'm not feeling
something super thick and crazy if that
makes sense it just feels really nice
and light so there is cordial go ahead
and swatch that here I'm gonna have to
build it up for you guys there is just
one swatch as you guys can see and for
reference I do not have any sort of
eyeshadow primer on my hands right now
but I'm gonna go ahead and build up the
swash so you guys can really see but do
you guys see what I mean when I said I
feel like it just picks up too much
product immediately with your finger or
with a brush what's that
you know you really have to kind of
blend that out and I just feel like
doesn't distribute the products evenly
if that makes sense and it doesn't
matter if you're using your finger or if
you're using a brush so anyway there is
cordial really really beautiful
transition shade honestly I really like
that and I like the way that it goes
into the crease you really can just use
a nice fluffy brush and just kind of go
back and forth really really fast it's
super super quick and easy now let's
talk about my favorite shade which is
cognac
it's just that beautiful sort of almost
ready undertone brown shade it's
beautiful like look at the formulation
on that I just want like this it's
gorgeous
I don't know what it is but this
particular shadow just has an awesome
formulation to it and when you swatch it
it really goes on nicely so as you can
see I'm still getting little balls of
product here so you do have to kind of
blend that out but the nice part about
those like three darker shades in the
palette is that they do blend so nicely
as you guys can see so you don't have to
spend tons and tons of time blending out
your eyeshadow I mean look at that like
that blended so quickly
really really beautiful shade love that
and then the final shade we have is
Bordeaux and I do like Bordeaux it's not
really my color I feel like I would have
liked it more if it was a little more
purpley I feel like this was their way
of putting in a pop of color without
being too extravagant and in-your-face
it is a cool toned dark brown color like
a espresso color however it has a purple
undertone to it so it's really beautiful
and this one is very matte it feels a
little it feels very very similar to
cognac however I do find that it's just
a little more flaky feeling if that
makes sense and there it is
swatched again we have that kind of like
streaking line there so we'll just go
ahead and kind of blend that out but the
nice part about these three darker
shades like I said is that they do blend
out so nicely so I mean this is just me
blending it with my finger you guys can
imagine what a brush can do so really
really nice overall I think the palette
is really a good product I'm not sitting
here and bashing yet by any means I just
wanted to give you guys my insight on
the formulation again I don't know if
this is the signature Rebecca
formulation if it is
I probably won't be picking up another
eyeshadow palette from them just because
I feel like I have you know my makeup
geek foiled eyeshadows or my makeup
forever artist shadows that are so
similar to you know these two shades
here but they have you know just a
better formulation and then I have
wonderful wonderful Mac palettes that
have you know shades like this and you
know colors like this so I don't know if
I would necessarily pick up another
backup palette if this is the
formulation but overall I think he does
a good palette is it worth the $40 I
think it is if you want to support
jaclyn hill now like I said if I were to
choose an item from the entire
collection I would still recommend going
ahead and paying the extra what $12 and
getting the face palettes because this
is just a stunning palette I do have
this on today and you get gorgeous
colors in here you get a lot of product
in here and it is so nice for all
different sort of skin tones and skin
types it's just really really good so if
you do want to support her and you do
want to get an item from her collection
and you're not sure what you want to get
I would highly recommend checking out
the face palette so anyway those are my
thoughts and swatches on the eyeshadow
palettes I like it for travel I'm gonna
toss this in my purse it's gonna live in
there it's a really nice little purse
palette if that makes sense
is it something that I would reach for
on an everyday sort of basis no it's not
but I do think it is very compact you
get all the sort of color colors you can
need to create a really really nice like
subtle sort of smoky warm cool toned eye
you know just very very natural looks
it's basically just an everyday sort of
friendly palette and I think that is
really really nice so anyway I hope you
guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for joining me let me know down
below if there is another item from a
champagne collection that you would like
me to pick up you guys know I'm not the
biggest fan of champagne pop it's just
because I am still fair it tends to be a
little more of a blush topper on me
today I have it on as my blush topper
really really loved it it's absolutely
gorgeous but let me know if you would
like me to pick up at the poured version
of like the
time later or the liquid version because
I think I could mix that with my
foundation it would look beautiful so
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I said that like 10 times and yeah
I will see you guys tomorrow so my fails
and how the rails bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
