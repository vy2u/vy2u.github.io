this video I have a review and swatches
for you guys on the new Becca Jaclyn
hill champagne collection face palette
if you guys have not heard Becca is
basically opening up more champagne
stuff they are basically opening up the
champagne collection a little more
besides just the shimmering skin
perfecter pressed and champagne pops so
they are expanding the collection and
they are now going to have an exclusive
new limited edition online-only face
palette and also a stampede collection
eyeshadow palette and then they are
going to have a shimmering skin
perfecter and champagne pop and also in
the port version those are not limited
edition so if you do want those then you
can go ahead and get those at any time
but I think the two items that are
really really being hyped up are the
face palette and the eyeshadow palette
those are going to be exclusive new
limited edition and online only I'm not
going to go too much into detail on how
I got my particular face palette early
because you no longer can get it early
it was not sent to me or anything like
that
they basically released I think 100 or
200 palettes early when they were having
their little champagne party to kind of
toast the whole collection and you no
longer can get it so I'm not going to go
into detail on that however on the Bekaa
Instagram page they do claim that the
whole collection will be available on
May 26 at 9 a.m. Pacific Standard time
for everyone and also in Sephora stores
on June 16 2016 so I would recommend
calling ahead of time for your stores
because sometimes it's a little harder
to get them but they will be online on
May 26 so I am going to leave a link
down below and if you're here after May
26 you can click on the link and
hopefully you can get yourself something
hopefully this particular palette and
the eyeshadow palette won't be like the
Too Faced sweet peach palette where
nobody can get it let's just keep our
fingers crossed that we can get our
hands on this kind of stuff so anyway on
this particular face palette features
two shimmering skin perfectors a
luminous blush and two mineral blushes
and Jaclyn Hale basically hand-picked at
these products the they are all new
shades except for champagne pop which is
her baby and this is a
$52.00 pilots any 136 $1 value the outer
packaging looks like this it's just a
gorgeous iridescent gold box with tons
of little champagne bubbles and then
they have a cute and nice little tribute
to Jacqueline herself on the back here
and then they showed names at the bottom
the actual palette looks like this I'm
in love with this palette you know
sometimes you just hold a palette and
you're like that feels good like that
feel good in my hands I like the way it
feels it feels nice if you'll think it
has good energy I know that sounds silly
but I feel like I could toss this across
the room not that I would but I feel
like I could toss this across the room
and nothing's gonna happen to the babies
in here so anyway
the back of the palette looks like this
they do have the names of the products
so you have the three blushes on the top
of the two shimmery skin perfectors at
the bottom and then you have a gold
mirror effect here I'm getting it all
greasy because I put hand cream on
before this review they do have a nice
little clasp closure and it snaps closed
and I feel like it's really really like
compact and nice in there so I'm happy
about that you do have this little part
here on the top which is white with the
gold I love anything silver and white or
anything gold and white I just feel like
it's very ethereal and like special I
don't know why I feel like a lot of
people like gold and white or silver and
white so I really really like this you
see Jacqueline Kayla Becca and the top
here actually has a little bit of like a
squishy material kind of like squishy
rubber and then you open it up you have
a huge mirror which I love because if
you think about it this is a face
palette and what do people do with face
pallets they travel with them so it
makes sense to have a nice big mirror
here and then this is what the actual
palette looks like on the inside you
have the two mineral blushes at the top
so you have Pomplamoose amaretto and
then the luminous blush is called Rosie
spritz
then we have champagne pop down here and
then we have Prosecco pop which is
champagne pops a little sister so anyway
it is mirrored on there as well and
really gorgeous my only complaint is
that you do get a little slip that comes
on the inside and it shows the names of
the product my complaint is look how
much room there is on here or why
couldn't you have printed the little
names underneath I really think
could have done that and I would have
loved it because I already lost my sheet
and I got this pellet yesterday so that
I feel like that says a lot you know
what I mean it's like really I mean I
already lost the sheet so it is nice
that they do have the sticker on the
back but think about it with like wear
and tear maybe that might come off and
then you're like what are the names
again so anyway I am really enjoying
this palette you guys I think this is
absolutely beautiful and a wonderful
wonderful value you are getting 2
full-size shimmering skin perfectors
here they are the same quality that you
know and love from the you know Becca
shimmering skin perfecter line they're
exactly like moonstone and pearl and
blush copper and all of those kind of
shades they're the same exact
formulation beautiful just in a really
nice compact version here we have a
luminous blush down here rosy spritz on
the luminous blush line is relatively
new to the Becca collection I have these
shades Snapdragon in Tigerlily they're
absolutely stunning very very pigmented
do not get it twisted girl though these
are very very pigmented and they will
show up with a lot of pigments and a lot
of color on your skin and then you are
getting two mineral blushes down here so
you are getting a matte in the middle
and that one is amaretto then you are
getting pump the mousse which is a
beautiful beautiful beautiful I would
say satin sort of blush so I really
really love the colors in here I feel
like Jacqueline did a good job of kind
of color picking here you know you have
to think about it when you are choosing
out colors for your own palette you
really wanted to be able to be very
versatile for everyone I have very very
fair skin and I feel like I can wear
every single shade in care and I feel
like people with darker skin medium skin
darker really really dark skin could
probably pull off probably every single
color in here except maybe amaretto
would start to blend in with certain
skin tones the darker you get but for
the most part I feel like she did a good
job with picking the color selection in
here I feel like when youtubers do
collaboration that's the biggest thing
that I look for is how did they color
pick everything does it work for
everyone is there worth of $52 so I do
think that she did a really really nice
job with that so let's go ahead and
start watching so right here we have
champagne pop and champagne pop is just
that gorgeous gorgeous golden Kichi
color it's not my favorites I know
people are probably going to shoot me
it's not my favorite shimmering skin
perfecter to be completely honest with
my fair skin tone I really like pearl
and I really like moonstone I have full
sizes of both of those I think they're
beautiful so this one is not my favorite
but it's still super gorgeous and I love
having it in my collection so there is
champagne pop this is what started it
all just a gorgeous gorgeous
glowy peachy golden color then we have
Prosecco pop and she describes this as
champagne pops a little sister Prosecco
pop is just a straight-up golden color
it's got a strong a strong gold
undertone now this is not the most
flattering if you do have very very fair
skin like I do today I have the two
highlighters paired together I have a
little bit of Prosecco pop on the bottom
and then I went in with champagne pop on
my cheekbones down the bridge of my nose
my Cupid's bow my chin because I really
wanted to kind of lift the color a
little bit so here we have Prosecco pop
you can see there's a lot more yellow
and golden going on there then there is
with champagne pop I think what makes
champagne pops so lovely on light skin
tones is the fact that it has that
peachy undertone and it really kind of
pulls light up but for the most part
these are still darker than my skin tone
so when I put them on I really like to
kind of layer them so that it's hitting
like the light the light is hitting my
face the right way if that makes sense I
hope that I'm saying that correctly and
you guys understand what I mean but
these are both super super gorgeous as
you can see the shimmering skin
perfector pressed version is just
beautiful it goes on without skip
skipping it's really really creamy and
luxurious I feel like you really want to
kind of buff these into the skin I
really like to use like my Sigma tapered
highlighter brush I really like to buff
it into the skin so that it's not
sitting on top of the skin you really
want to blend it in so it's one with
your skin these tend to be a little on
the powdery side but that's just normal
I feel like with Becca face products
they tend to have a lot of kick up a lot
of you know products that basically just
comes up when you dip your brush in so
definitely tap off the excess on the
outside of the palate when you go in
with these and that goes for the
luminous flush with mineral blushes and
the
shimmering skin perfectors in here they
just do tend to have a bit of a powdery
consistency and I think it is because
they are so finely milled and soft so
anyway those are the two highlighters
now we're going to go ahead and get into
the blushes so the first shade is pump
la mousse which is right here and it is
a gorgeous satin grapefruit sort of
color and if you know what Pomplamoose
means then you understand the name so
Pomplamoose means grapefruit in french
and i feel like this particular color
really does look like a nice ripe
grapefruit and you have to be a little
careful with the mineral blushes from
becca these are extremely extremely
pigmented so a little goes a long way
but I really love this color I love that
she tossed it in here to be completely
honest because if you covered this and
you're looking at it this way this is a
very kind of like neutral looking
palette but then you go like this and
it's like you have some life in there
you know you have a nice beautiful pop
of color so I really love the shade
Pomplamoose here it is on the back of my
hand it's got the tiniest amount of
shimmer in there which is why I kind of
consider it to be a satin finish all
right now we'd have the middle shade
which is the matte and the shade is
called amaretto and I feel like Alboreto
can be used for a lot of things if you
do have fair skin like I do you could
use this as like an all-over bronzer
it's actually got a really gorgeous kind
of pinky hue to it and if you are cool
like you have a cool undertone in your
skin and you're fair complected like I
am I really love a rosy kind of bronzy
color like that because I think it looks
really beautiful on the skin like I said
if you have darker or like medium to
dark really deep skin this is not going
to show up on you but I really think
it's the only one in the entire palette
that's not gonna show up on you so I do
still think it's worth it but this kind
of reminds me of Mac's Sun bask which I
know is one of Jaclyn Hales favorite Mac
blushes except it doesn't have like that
kind of glow to it it's mostly just
completely flat and matte you may be
able to see a little bit of shimmer in
there but that's probably just from the
other swatches so it's just a beautiful
sort of rosy rosy bronze color I would
call it really really enjoy that color a
lot and then the last shade that we have
in the whole palette is this luminous
right here and the shade is called Rose
a Spetz and this just reminds me of like
narcissus orgasm it reminds me of the
bombs hot mama blush it's just that
beautiful peachy color with that
gorgeous iridescent gold shimmer in it
and the Becca luminous blushes are new I
was just talking about that they're new
and they're basically a mixture of their
mineral blushes with a shimmering skin
perfecter pressed in there so this is
rose a spritz absolutely stunning this
is what I am wearing on my cheeks today
and I absolutely love it you can see
it's just as pigmented as the mineral
blushes you can go a little lighter I
feel like no you can go a little more
heavy-handed with the luminous blushes
then you can with the mineral blushes
but I still recommend using a pretty
fluffy brush even for the luminous
blushes because they go on with pure
pigment so anyway let me tell you guys
what I am wearing on my face today
because I actually have this palette all
over my face so like I said I have
Prosecco pop layered with champagne pop
on top on at my chin on my Cupid's bow
down the bridge of my nose on my
cheekbones and I went in with the shade
Pomplamoose I mixed it with a little bit
of vaseline and put it on my lips I took
this shade Pomplamoose again and put it
all over my lid I went in with these
shade amaretto and I worked that into
the crease and then I put these shade
rows a spritz on to the apples of my
cheeks so I feel like it's one of those
palettes that you really can just make
it your own and these are great shadows
again because you can use them as
eyeshadows I mean they're great products
because you can use them as eyeshadow as
I said shadows but anyway this will make
it gorgeous lid color this is a great
transition color that's beautiful you
can pop it underneath the lower lash
line you can use any of the shimmering
skin perfectors as well as you know - I
don't know highlight the inner corner of
your eye where it is the lip color
they're all just gorgeous so I feel like
although this is a face palette it's
really a whatever you want it to be sort
of palette and I think it's just a great
value and a really great product so they
have a beautiful formulation it is the
formulation that we know and love from
Becca for the mineral blushes luminous
blushes the what was I going to say oh
there should we just convert back
through that was just going to say the
champagne pops skin Perfector
it's what you know and love and you just
get so much product in here any
beautiful contact and I think Jacqueline
did a really really good job so
congratulations to Becca and
congratulations to Jacqueline hail I
hope you guys enjoyed this little review
and swatches and you come back Joe yes I
am definitely going to get that
eyeshadow palette if I can get it
hopefully I can they're saying that it's
going to be easy to get everything so
