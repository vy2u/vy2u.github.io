today's video I have a review and
swatches on two out of the four new
Becca Jacqueline Hill champagne splits
so I picked up these shades flower child
and also champagne pop and then I also
picked up hyacinth and champagne pop as
you guys know I already do own the
champagne collection face palette and I
also do own the eye shadow palette I'm
going to go ahead and link my reviews
down below for these two products if you
would like to see them I did review them
before all of the big controversy went
down I didn't give this a very good
review but I love this I really think
the champagne face palette is beautiful
so anyway I purchased these for 38
dollars a piece on the Sephora comm
website they currently are all available
there are four different shades you can
pick from like I said you have a
champagne pop and flower child you have
hyacinth and flower child you have
Prosecco pop and amaretto and then you
have Pomplamoose and Prosecco pop as
well so it really just kind of depends
on if you have the champagne phase
palate yet or if you have some of the
mineral blushes or like a full size of
champagne pop I will tell you guys um I
only picked up the two that obviously I
didn't have duplicates of in this
particular palette so in here I already
have Pomplamoose and I already have
amaretto and I already have two seco pop
so I just got the other two that had
champagne pop in them because first of
all I don't own any of the back of
mineral blushes I've heard great things
about flower child and hyacinth was too
beautiful to like pass up on and second
of all I personally do not own a full
size of champagne pop so that is why I
purchased these I know there is a lot of
controversy right now with the actual
amount of product that you get in these
particular little duo's you are getting
0.13 ounces of I believe the highlighter
I think the highlighter is 0.13 ounces
and then the other hat like pan is the
blush and that is 0.15 ounces so I want
to say really quickly you are not
getting a whole lot of product in here
at all you can actually get a full size
of champagne pop for $38 and I think you
get 0.27 ounces so something to think
about if you are not like an avid
collector like I am maybe you want to go
ahead and just get a full-size but this
is special because first of all is the
it's a continuation on the champagne
collection that Jaclyn hailed take
great with Becca and second of all I'm
sorry but this packaging I can't I
literally can't and that is something
that a true beauty addict would say I've
just am in love with the actual
packaging so anyway like I said these
are $38 these are limited edition just
so you guys know so if you do want to
pick them up I would go ahead and do so
right now Prosecco pop is a limited
edition shade champagne pop is part of
their regular collection hyacinth flower
childs are part of their regular
collection as well so you could just
pick those up in a regular size if you
would like to but these particular duos
are limited edition they are a blush duo
and the highlights and features and
sculpts the cheek and select shades that
are curated exclusively by Jaclyn hill
it says contour with color and shimmer
infused with these best-selling
highlighters and mattes and blushes
shimmering skin Perfector press
spotlight to your features while mineral
blush adds a vibrant pop of color it
says mix-and-match to create endless
looks with shimmering shades that add
depth and matte shades that provide
pigment rich tones for a variety of
different sort of radiant finishes each
can be worn separately or layered for a
sculpted multi-dimensional glow and
shimmer and Colour blah blah blah
whatever alright so I will say overall
you guys I really really enjoyed this
product so like I said you're really not
getting too much product in here so if
you're someone who really like goes
through if you like hit pan on
highlighters and you only use one like
highlighter every single day I would
recommend not getting this it's just not
worth of money because you're really
just not getting that much product in
here however the packaging is absolutely
beautiful and if you're like me you're a
makeup junkie and you're never going to
hit pan on either of these shades I
would say you can still go ahead and
pick it up I do have a few complaints
first of all like I said the actual um
you know amount of product that you're
getting here getting in here is not that
great and second of all I wish they
would have done more about the color
selection I wish they would have done a
percent will pop with like a new
luminous blush or maybe like champagne
pop with one of the new luminous blushes
or a new curated mineral blush or
something like that but I think because
this eyeshadow palette was kind of a
fail on a lot of different levels um you
know either you got an okay one or you
got our complete one or you got a
good one mine was just okay I feel like
they really were trying to make up for
it very quickly by releasing these
particular splits so I feel like they
didn't put that much time into it you
guys because if a
they would have come up with new shades
from the mineral blush line or maybe
they would have put in the new luminous
blushes which are absolutely fantastic
and amazing but overall I think they did
good with this even though it was like
done in at the nick of time like very
very quickly I would say that these are
very comparable to what you get in the
champagne face palette now I absolutely
adore this palette and I will say I do
think the highlights in here is actually
softer and creamier and the blush in
here is a lot softer and creamier than
what you get in the face palette now
there's a lot of people on the Sephora
comm website that are saying is that in
these particular splits the champagne
pop color is not as creamy and buttery
as the full-size like I said I don't
have a full size of champagne pop so I
can't compare that for you guys but I
will say when I brush my finger in
champagne pop versus the one that is in
here it does feel a lot more creamy and
not as rough or sandpapery if that makes
sense not to say that this was super
sandpapery because I love this palette
and I think it's a very very good
quality but I guess that the original
champagne popped like the full size is
super super buttery again I've never
swatched it I don't own a full size so I
have no idea but anyway here is what the
outer packaging looks like the one thing
that is just so on point with this
particular champagne collection you guys
and the one thing that I have just
consistently loved about every single
item that I have purchased is the
packaging it's amazing I love white and
gold and this is just spectacular this
is beautiful this is beautiful
even the eyeshadow palettes the
packaging mirrored effect everything
about it I absolutely love and the outer
packaging is no exception it's just a
beautiful glossy gold box as you guys
can see it says Becca Jacqueline Hill
champagne splits it does show you what
colors you have at the top you have a
little bio on the back of for Jacqueline
Hale herself and it's just the same on
both box boxes I should say and then the
outer packaging is really cute it's just
their typical sort of like I feel like
this looks like a little spaceship what
do you guys think I always thought that
these little Becca compacts look like
little spaceships super super cute they
are basically this beautiful white gold
on the outside and then the darker part
here is not really like a true silver
it's kind of like a tarnished silver if
you guys see behind me my whole area
back there is kind of like silver or
tarnished silver so I really really like
the look of not just like
right silver I like that too but I
really love the look of the tarnished
silver thing I really love the packaging
I think it's just so stunning and I'm
just kind of like oh look at these
little spaceships they're adorable
so you open it up you do have a nice big
mirror here which I appreciate and then
this is what the actual packaging looks
like so this one up here is flower child
and then we have champagne pop at the
bottom here and then I will show you
guys hyacinth which is beautiful
hyacinth and champagne pop is our boss I
am wearing on my face today right now so
here is hyacinth and then here is
champagne pop now they say on the actual
website that the blushes that are in
here are supposed to be masked like all
of them and now I do know that
Pomplamoose and also amaretto from the
face palette I know those are matte and
I can see that hyacinth is matte but you
guys I really don't think flour child is
that matte every set every time I put my
finger in there and I swatch it I swear
there's like a little bit of like a
luminous sheen now I could be mistaken
so let me go on and tell you guys
another little if you think that I have
with this particular product I
I love the thought that they are split
pants okay I think these are awesome for
travel if you want to carry them in your
purse that's awesome I would highly
recommend really really kind of putting
them in an area where they're not going
to shatter a lot of people tell me that
these are prone to shattering and
breaking I will be traveling with this
particular one up to the cabin next week
and I do go ahead and wrap everything in
bubble wrap so I personally have never
had anything break from Becca or from
any line in general I've never had
makeup break when I travel but if you do
want to pop these in your purse which I
think they're perfect for I would
recommend kind of you know wrapping them
in something and then popping them in
but I really liked the thought of the
split pants but immediately first of all
the price I was like yeah that's kind of
ridiculous for what you're getting
second of all like I said I didn't like
that these colors have already been done
like I said they had Prosecco pop and
then amaretto
pomplamoose and I was like but I already
got those in the face palette like why
do I need those so that was kind of
bothersome to me just because you
already have these down here you also
have champagne pop in here again I think
because it was such a last-minute sort
of you know this was like the last part
of their collaboration because of how
you know this kind of got screwed up I
do feel like they kind of put this
together last minute and that's why they
didn't really go out and kind of like
you know try something new and
innovative but I really do like the
split pan thought but now my last
linked on these particular guys is the
fact that they are split pan so although
I really do like that they are split pan
I will say anytime you are dipping your
brush in there which by the way I really
like using a tapered blush brushes for
these because first of all not a whole
lot of product here you only have a
small space to go ahead and dip your
brush in so what I like to do is use a
tapered fluffy brush for both of these
because the mineral blushes are damn
pigmented you guys super super pigmented
so a very fluffy angled brush I'll go in
and then I'll tap off the excess there
really isn't that much fallout or kick
up which I'm very very excited and like
proud of I'm like good job like I think
that's awesome oh and I do want to say
really quickly these are made in the USA
just so you guys know I know that the
eyeshadow palette was made in China but
this is made in the USA just like the
actual face palette but anyway my
biggest complaint is if I go in with too
big of a brush it's going to start going
into the champagne pop color no matter
which duo I'm using they are the same
size so that starts to happen if I'm
trying to dip into champagne pop what I
notice is that they start to go into
like the actual color starts to leak
into the other so like I said I thought
even though they said that this is
supposed to be a matte blush up here I
feel like there's a little bit of Sheen
and I don't know if it's because my
champagne pop highlighter is kind of
leaking into the other one they do have
this little bar right here which is
quite high as higher than the actual
product which should help to stop any
sort of like intermingling but for the
most part I do notice that they do start
to kind of you know blend into each
other which kind of sucks because like I
said these are supposed to be matte and
obviously this is a highlighted shimmery
so I will say that is something that I
have started to notice especially with
hyacinth and I don't want hyacinths to
be super shimmery because it's already a
wham bam in-your-face sort of highlight
so anyway that's really my only
complaint like I said those three things
I think that these are good quality
I do find they are a very very pigmented
very very buttery and they have like no
Fallout I'm very surprised because in
the face palette I did notice that the
blushes had a little more fallout and
kick-up and also the fact that the
highlighters in the face palette
actually had more kick up and fall out
so when I actually rub my finger in like
the highlight here or if I rub it into
the blush it doesn't feel nearly as soft
battery as when I like rub it in to one
of the split pans and again I don't know
like this is the thing about Becca's now
everybody's super skeptical because
they're like hey you know are all of the
products made evenly because now I don't
know if I just got good ones or if
everything's like this I really have no
idea I will say I do feel like the
blushes are definitely a little more
firmly packed and pressed and they could
be prone to getting some hardpan they
are a little more firmly press than the
actual highlight but the highlight to me
feels a lot more creamy than it does in
the actual face palette so that's just
something to be aware of I think the
quality is about right at the same level
as the champagne face palette again I
don't own any of the mineral blushes in
full size or they highlight so I can't
compare it to that but I would say it's
very very similar to the champagne
collection on face palette so anyway I
think they're very beautiful very
pigmented if you like the look and if
you like having split pans that's
definitely something you should look
into again $38 you could just get a
full-size blush or you could get a
full-size highlight but for the most
part I do think they are beautiful they
are made here in the USA I think they
are good quality and I think they are
very pigmented and blendable they do
stay on the cheeks for a really really
nice amount of time I have been wearing
mine for only about two hours now I just
woke up and I'm filming but I have been
wearing hyacinth on my cheeks I really
love the color because it's one of those
colors that's super pigmented but if you
put it on lightly it looks like as my
friend Rochelle would say it looks like
you just went out into like the winter
time or something like that and your
cheeks have like that just bitten effect
or you can use it with a heavy hand and
you have like hot pink cheeks hot pink
cheeks but for the most part I think
it's a really beautiful duo my favorite
out of the two of them is probably the
hyacinth even though I will be bringing
a flower child up to the cabin with me
this one's very neutral the flower child
blush is something that everybody raves
about I never got the becca afterglow
palette or anything with any of these
mineral blushes in them which is again
another reason why I purchased them but
overall I think these are really good
quality you guys very similar to the
champagne face palette you may leave a
comment down below and say it doesn't
feel anything like
full-size champagne you know highlights
but again I don't know I don't have a
full-size of that and I don't have a
full-size of the mineral blushes so
unfortunately I can't compare it to
those but I can compare it to the
champagne face palette and I think they
are very very similar so let's go ahead
and get into some swatches so first we
are going to do flower child and
champagne pop so here we have a
champagne pop and there is flower child
as you guys can see there's a little bit
of a sheen with flower child but I just
love the way that these go on I do find
them very very blendable and I like I
said they're very very pigmented so
there is champagne pop and there is
flower child and they do blend out
really really nicely you guys so there
is champagne pop blend it out and then
here is flower child blend it out so
there they are really really beautiful I
am I'm very happy with these you guys I
am very very happy all right the next is
of course hyacinth which is that
beautiful bright pink color and then we
have champagne pop this high its highest
and shade you guys to see that so you'll
see that it is very very very intense
like it's super super super crazy
pigmented so I really really like it
it's just a hot raspberry color that's
exactly what I would explain it as and
there is hyacinth and then there is
champagne pop but let me go ahead and
blend out hyacinth for you guys so there
is hyacinth blended out as you can see
still really really like hot raspberry
color and then here is the champagne pop
blend it out so overall I think they're
very very nice am I going to say that
they're like the most buttery soft thing
that I've ever touched in my life no but
they don't feel like sandpaper in my
opinion they feel good they feel soft
they feel buttery we know they're made
here in the USA I do think they are good
quality just make sure that you are
someone who wants to spend the money on
basically the splits because like I said
you can get a full-size blush or a
full-size highlight for the price but I
really like these I think they're gonna
be perfect for travel and overall I
would say that there's something you
definitely should look into in the
champagne collection I would say that
the eye shadow palette you should skip
on the face palette definitely look into
that if you can still get it
they split so definitely look into and
then I heard that the little eye pencils
my friend at work tried out the Topaz
shade she said he was completely
horrible it got all oily on her eyes and
it started creasing I'm not going to
pick those up now because I'm just
ever since she said that so I'm
personally not going to get those I
would stay away from those overall I
would stay away from the I stuff in the
collection but the face stuff seems to
be pretty darn good so I hope this
review and swatches was helpful thanks
so much for joining me guys and I'll see
you tomorrow
