going to be doing a review and some
swatches for you guys on the three
scoops of sexy kit from benefit
everything came packaged in these really
cute little boxes like this it actually
all came in one bigger box but then um
you know the little lolli tints and
bombs and whatnot all came in separate
little boxes like this I do keep this
one little boxster so you guys could see
how keep the packaging bugs but
basically the concept of this was that
you get the benefits lollitint lolly I'm
sorry Benetint and Posie tint which are
the cheek / lip stains that are most
popular from benefit these are a really
popular products you can get them in
like full size um you know kits they
give a nice cheek tint and they also
give just a nice like light staying to
your lips or your cheeks now they had
this new thing that came out this year
was that with the actual tint every
single one had a matching bone so we're
talking a nice full-size lip balm here
and all of them smelt like Rose which is
like beautiful i love the center rose so
i absolutely love that all three of the
bomb smell like that and they are all
three full-size so all of these go along
with be matching um tint so anyway let's
just get started and i'll talk to you
guys about the colors and what i think
of them and all of that but let's just
start here I have the UH which so I
would call this probably like the the
red one this is the been appalled might
here so the lip balm and the benetint
right there so you can see these are
more like red in tone de been a bomb and
all of the bombs in general are not as
pigmented as the tints but this is the
Penta balm up close really really nice
color very very smooth on the lips again
not super pigmented but these are balls
you know and I just have to say the
packaging oh so cute and so that is the
bomb and this is the tint
just show you guys like the little
applicator it's like this little red
basically just a little brush and you
just brush on the color it's super super
liquidy and Ashley it's funny this one
is the most watery one out of all of
them the benetint one in my opinion so
those two are right there the next one
we have this is like a big jumbo swatch
of the balm this is the Posey balm and
the Posie tint so Posey bomb Posie tint
so Posey bomb looks like this I would
say it's more of like a peachy color
looks like that peachy pink love it and
the tint is also peachy now it's funny
like I said I thought the Benetton had
like the thinnest formula because this
one is a lot thicker and if you can see
on the actual swatch on my arm the tint
came off like a quite you know strong so
that was kind of interesting ah I don't
know if you can see that but it was
interesting this one was definitely the
lightest one like the thinnest formula
and then it just gradually got to a
really thick one which we call to next
which is the lolly bomb and the lolly
tint the lolly bomb and Lolly tints are
more of like a lilac color I would say
this is the bomb beautiful that's mom
mmm I just love the scent an actual tint
the lolly tint this one is so thick like
it was really interesting to see that
the formulation of the tints were a
little different so this tint is just
like very like um thick just kind of
goes on there and I don't know it just
seems thicker than the Benetint which
was a little more liquidy inconsistency
like when I would move my hand a little
bit would drip down not with this one
that just kind of stays there so this is
definitely more on the lilac purple II
side of things and here are the swatches
that is the lolly right yeah lolly ball
and Lolly tint so I would have to say my
favorites out of these actually are um
the Posie tint I love the Posie tint
which is like this nice really really
pinky kind of peachy tint color so let
me show you guys that once you guys can
see Posie tint it's definitely my
favorite tint but my favorite bomb is
the lolly ball so I really really like
this little set I think it's awesome
that you get full sizes of the bones and
of course I think it's awesome that you
get these nice like deluxe sized samples
of the actual tints um one of my
favorite things to do with these is
actually take the tint and its
corresponding matching bomb and just
layer them so you can layer the tint on
your lips and then you can put the ball
over it and it just keeps them nice and
moisturized all day so anyway here are
the squatches again this is the three
scoops of sexy from benefits I hope you
guys enjoyed this and i'll see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
