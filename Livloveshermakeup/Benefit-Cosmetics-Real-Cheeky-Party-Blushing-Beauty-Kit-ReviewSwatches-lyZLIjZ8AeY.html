thank you so much for joining me as
always I hope you guys are having a
fantastic day this is going to be the
kickoff of basically pilot season I call
it pilot season because it is that time
of year where all of the makeup brands
whether it's drugstore like low and
high-end all of the makeup brands start
coming out with like holiday kits
holiday pilots things like that so this
is going to be my first video reviewing
a palette that recently launched from
Benefit Cosmetics
um and I'm so excited I love this time
of year because they start to release
these kind of sets and palettes and I
basically just take my wallet and dump
it out and just give like Sephora and
also all of my money because it is so
tempting there are so many things that
come out and especially this year it's a
little earlier Sephora recently kind of
like release stuff earlier I don't know
this year is just so exciting it's not
all in like October and November this
year it's like they even came in
September we started releasing stuff
very very cool anyway so today's video
is going to be a review I'm also gonna
do swatches for you guys on a new
palette that released from benefits it
is called the real cheeky party palette
it is $42 and you want to go ahead and
purchase this at Ulta it is on the
Sephora calm website as well however the
reason you want to purchase it from Ulta
is because you get some goodies with it
so you do get this cute little travel
makeup pouch that says laughter is the
best cosmetics and it says benefit to
San Francisco it's got this adorable
little hot pink tassel and you open it
up and I almost love the inside of the
packaging more it looks like that and it
says benefits benefit benefit San
Francisco all over it and it's so cute
and I think that ordering from Ulta is
better because you get free stuff it's
better to have free stuff to not get
free stuff so it is the same price on
each website but you also get one more
thing um so inside the little bag you
get to the deluxe size sample of the
roller lash mascara from benefit which
is a really nice mascara it is not my
all-time favorite from benefit
um but it is really really nice so it's
got kind of a little bit of a curve and
this is a nice little you know sample
size so basically you get free stuff if
you order from Ulta highly recommend
doing that instead of purchasing for the
same price on the sephora website and
not getting extra goodies so anyway you
guys saw what the box looks like it
looks like this I want to say right away
um last year they came out with I think
basically the same exact palette um
correct me if I'm wrong please I do know
that they had all of like their blushes
and like the hoola bronzer and things
like that in the palette last year I did
not get my hands on that palette last
year and I was so bummed I can't tell
you guys I really tried and it was gone
by the time I tried to get it so I knew
I had to get on this this year I have
heard from quite um a few other like
beauty gurus and things like that that
if you got last year's um face palette
from benefit then you probably don't
need this one that's why I think they
are quite similar or maybe even the same
but I just want to show you guys what
you get in here you get the dandelion
blush you get the rocket or blush the
sugar bomb blush or it can be a
highlight depending on your skin tone
the hoola bronzer which is completely
matte and the coralista blush so um
hoola is basically a cult favorite of
benefit it is a completely mapped
gorgeous gorgeous bronzer I am wearing
that today and coralista is another
really really I don't even want to say
hyped up product because it is so good I
have tried it before I have used hoola
before but coralista is like a beautiful
beautiful blush that everybody talks
about and then of course they have their
real mascara in here as well which is
awesome it is more of like a deluxe eye
sample but it is one of my favorite
favorite favorite mascaras of all time
so I am always on the bandwagon when it
comes to that um and then you also get
the they're real push-up liner which I'm
undecided about I do have other sizes of
that product de the full size and other
little sample sizes and it can be a
little difficult to work with but
overall you get a lot of stuff in here
and you also do get the what's know it's
what's up like what's like like
like Oh block but everybody calls it
what's up highlighter so you get a good
amount of stuff in here I am gonna show
you guys the actual packaging it looks
like this it is so cute so this is like
a big tin so this is the back on the
sides it looks like that it's like these
cute little polka dots polka spots
whatever you want to call them and this
is the front so I think this is just so
cute it's really out there and kind of
in-your-face which I think benefit
always has like products that are kind
of like out there I don't know like
their packaging is always adorable so
and it says the real key keeper key a
blushing beauty kit so I think it's
adorable it does have this little
magnetic closure and the first thing
that I noticed when I open this up is
like the disappointment that there is no
mirror right there I feel like they
really had the opportunity to go ahead
and put a mirror in there and they
didn't and I'm just like oh come on that
could have been a really nice sized
mirror because this like top part is
very chunky and I think that they could
have thinned it down and put a mirror in
but they didn't that's okay but these
are the goodies and you get inside so
like I said you get the highlighter you
get the eyeliner the mascara and then
you get those gorgeous blushes and that
bronzer all of the blushes or they call
them face powders I don't know why they
call them face powders I guess it
depends on what kind of skin tone you
have what color you are for me I'm very
fair so everything in here is a blush
and then the hoola bronzer is obviously
a bronzer but depending on your skin
tone how dark you are if you're a little
more deep or you have like a really dark
tan some of these colors might show up
as a highlight on you so they don't
really specify what it is they actually
kind of write on the back like danza
line brightening face powder so I guess
it could be a highlight for some people
it is a blush for me but I want to tell
you guys what I am wearing right away I
am wearing the rocket or blush which is
that gorgeous kind of mauve blush down
there and I have dandelion which is that
liked pink color right on my cheeks and
then I do have hoola bronzer which is
that beautiful matte everyday sort of
bronze are all over kind of just lightly
contouring my face I did put on the
what's up are the wax app but it's so
weird wax like the white what's that
the what's up highlight I have that on
my cheekbones down my nose on my chin
and it's kind of difficult it is more of
a cream product and I am wearing kind of
a heavy a heavier like foundation today
with a lot of powder so I feel like it
didn't go on as smoothly as I would like
but I think that if you're not wearing a
very I'm wearing the L'Oreal infallible
today as my foundation so I think that
if you are wearing like a BB cream or a
CC cream things like that you could
really kind of blend it in nicely I
could have done it different ways but
today I went on a little blotchy but I
do like this highlight I have used it
before I'm and then I am wearing the
theory love mascara so anyway let's just
get right into this I do want to mention
right away that they do have one of
these little safety covers that does
cover the palate when it comes like that
so if you are worried about making the
product or if you are traveling that is
something that is nice to have I am
going to toss mine because I don't use
these but yeah so let's just get right
into it I want to show one more thing
that came with it if this is the little
pamphlet that comes with it it kind of
reminds me of like the two-faced
products they show different kind of
tips on how to use each product I would
say the trickiest product you use in
here is the they're real push-up liner I
think a lot of people have had problems
with that it's kind of difficult so I do
like that they show you kind of how to
use that so anyway let's just get right
into it I'm going to show you guys again
what the palette looks like and we are
gonna go ahead and swatch so the first
thing I'm going to start watching is the
dandelion face powder or you know
depending on your skin coloring
highlight blush whatever so I'm just
gonna swatch that on the back of my hand
it is really beautiful it does have a
little bit of shimmer and it is just a
really really pale light pink color so
it is right there on my hand you might
not even be able to see it I did try
using it today almost as a highlight
and honestly it's just a little a tad
too dark for me as a highlight but if
you have darker skin than me this may be
a highlight on you but it's really
beautiful I noticed that these smell
look really good I know that sounds
weird but back in the day when I had the
hoola bronzer and the coralista blush in
like their little boxed packaging which
is what most of these come like if you
get them full size they come in like a
little box packaging they never smelled
this good I don't know if they change
the formula but all of these sound like
perfume me and really delicious but
anyway the dandelion powder because it
is kind of like that light piece Steve
creamy the light pink color it does get
a little bit of kick up and it is a
little powdery so you just kind of want
to watch for that the next one I'm gonna
swatch is the rocket or blush this is
gorgeous I have never tried this before
this was one of the reasons I really
wanted to get this palette was because
I've heard so many good things it is a
gorgeous like kind of Mavi neutral blush
and it is just beautiful it has a small
amount of Sheen to it and I think it's
gorgeous
so that is the rocket or blush I am
wearing that today topped with dandelion
on top but I think it's just absolutely
beautiful I really really love that
color I've heard such good things about
it so I couldn't wait to of course try
that one out another one that is new to
me is a sugar bomb it looks like
hopefully you guys can see it is that
one that has like the four different
colors so basically very very shimmery
it's got kind of a golden color mixed
with a peachy bronze and I like to just
swirl them all together and you get this
kind of interesting peachy horley
highlight shade if that makes sense you
probably could get away with using this
as a highlight if you have darker skin
than I do but for me it makes a really
really beautiful like blush kind of
topper so that is what it looks like
really really beautiful I have played a
little bit with this and I do like have
a lot I like I'm tapping it over the
brachot or blush especially
the next one is the hoola bronzer which
is just the neutral neutral matte
gorgeous bronzer eye this is one of
those things that everybody talks about
I used to have my full-size with this I
went through it completely I am very
fair so that really goes to show that it
can work for a lot of different skin
tones this was like the original matte
bronzer that like came out I swear to
you this was like before to face like
this was it so that is what it looks
like you can apply it lightly I applied
it with a very fluffy brush today
applied it I said I apply it but in
general I do with a very fluffy brush
just so that it doesn't get too dark on
me because I am quite fair but it's
gorgeous it's matte it is buildable it's
really really wonderful and then the
last powder product in here is coralista
which is also a very well-known blush it
is just a gorgeous Coralie color it's
got a bit of Sheen to it
it's beautiful back in the day this was
also one of those really really popular
like blush shades that you could get at
like sephora or Ulta so it looks like
that lots of Sheen absolutely gorgeous
okay rumba is coming out so if you hear
the little vacuum cleaner he is out he
just announced himself so sorry about
that but I'm really really really
beautiful absolutely love machine on
coralista is gorgeous and this is
another one that I have had a full-size
of and I completely used it up so love
that so yeah I would say that with the
powder products to get a really nice
selection they're beautiful depending on
what your skin tone is they can be
highlights they can be blushes um I just
I love them I've always really liked the
boxed you know powders that they have
some benefit so I knew I'd like this but
just be careful they can pick up a lot
of product and because they are so soft
and creamy they tend to get a little bit
of kick up so just make sure that you
kind of top off your brush before you
start applying alright next I'm going to
Swach the little highlight in here it is
the what's app highlighter or what's up
oh my god I can't say this they Watts up
highlighter it looks like this it's
really really pretty it is a cream
product and it's kind of like a Goldy
champagne sort of shape I am wearing it
today like I said so this is what it
looks like swatched on the back of my
hand it is really really beautiful I
wish that they had this in a powder form
because I am more likely to do powder
highlights than I am to do cream
highlights but I think it just depends
on what you're working with if you're
using BB creams and things like that
this probably would like to live into
the skin so nice because it is a really
really creamy but if you apply it on top
of an already really powdered face I
think that it tends to look a little
chunky so I'll have to work with it more
I do have a few like samples of this I
think I might even have the full size I
just haven't played with it that much
because I have a lot of highlighters
haha but I'm definitely going to start
using this and definitely get into it a
little more I like I said I think it
does apply really really beautifully if
you're wearing lighter makeup on the
face alright the next product I'm in
here is the bear real push-up liner and
this is the product that I would say
probably is like the most controversial
first of all I cannot get it out of the
packaging which is not cool there we go
it looks like this and it is basically
supposed to be like a tight liner so you
know you have your waterline which is
the bottom and then you have your tight
line which is on top and this is
supposed to be like a small little
rubber thing brush that gets right up in
there so it looks like you have really
really nice thick lashes because when
you do your tight line or when you cover
your tight line with any kind of color
really well any kind of dark color it
really defines the eye it makes it look
really really like out there and pretty
and it makes it look like your lashes
are very very thick so this is what the
applicator looks like and I will tell
you I've had to wipe this down quite a
few times so that's kind of annoying you
do screw it up from the bottom like this
and I will swatch it for you guys it is
a gorgeous gorgeous a deep deep black
color but but I think the biggest issue
with this I love the concept I think it
is doable but the problem is is that a
lot comes out at once and it can be a
little chunky of little thick you really
have to work well with it if that makes
sense and it does kind of take a lot for
the actual product to come up so I'm
gonna swatch this for you guys and you
can see right away it kind of comes off
like in a blog so you want to work it on
the back of your hand first in my
opinion and then go in with the
applicator because if you just take it
with that look lob and start putting it
on there it's gonna get all over your
eye but basically it is really inky and
black it is matte it really does stay a
long time I do like it I love the
concept I just find that I have to do it
you know work with it differently than
how they recommend on the website just
made like a little Pacman there but
basically I just think too much product
comes out at once and then you know the
brush just looks kind of gross I always
wipe it off after each time I use it so
and I know it's okay
it's definitely not my favorite thing in
this palette the main reason I got this
palette was for the powder products but
this is one of those things that can be
used and even you can put it on the back
of your hand going with a separate brush
that you like and use it as a any kind
of eyeliner that you want so it's really
up to you it is an interesting concept
it does take a little bit of like a
learning curve you have to kind of learn
how to apply it so not my favorite thing
in the palette but moving on one of my
favorite things in the palette besides
the powder product is the they're real
mascara this is one of my ultimate
favorite mascaras in general it
definitely one of my Holy Grails it's
got an amazing
spiky blond with like a little ball tip
applicator at the ends you can really
get onto the sides of the lashes I am
wearing just one coat of it today and I
think it's absolutely stunning gorgeous
and it is a rubber bristle brush which
is one of my favorite kinds I tend to
lean more towards those I think they're
easier just be careful that you don't
poke yourself in the eye with it because
it is quite a thick brush but um overall
they're real firm benefit is an amazing
amazing mascara so you are you know it's
likely that we get that in the little
pallets so anyway oh my gosh look at
this now now I'm going to try and wipe
this off and it's not going to come off
you know it's a good product like it
stays on it's just the applicator is
crazy
that was pretty eyeliner by the way but
anyway so um yeah so that is the
swatches reviews thoughts on this little
palette that is out from benefit love
the packaging absolutely love the powder
products in here all of these are
blushes except for the hoola bronzer on
me personally just beautiful I am so
impressed
I'm so happy this is a great deal $42
this is what a like 116 dollar value so
a very very good deal and plus you get
these extra little um products over here
you can highlight you get the therapy O
push-up liner and then B they're real
mascara which is just like a nice thing
to have I would have bought this for $42
even if it just had the powder products
that's mainly why I wanted the kit but I
think it's awesome that they also add me
into so really really excited I really
love this I highly recommend picking it
up I I would say if you got a pallet
last year which I have heard and I if I
recall correctly I don't want to say it
is but if I recall correctly from
watching videos and things like that it
is basically the same thing maybe they
had switched up a few of the powder
products but if you have those from last
year there's probably no need to get
this particular palette but because I
missed out on last year's I was very
very
excited to pick this up so two thumbs up
for the stylet very excited very happy I
think it will be nice to for travel I do
wish that they had put a mirror here or
at least made the packaging a little
thinner because then it would be easier
for travel but overall you know you have
your bronzers in here your blushes about
highlight eyeliner mascara all you need
to pack with this is what like a
foundation and concealer and powder and
you're good to go for your traveling so
awesome awesome kits are really really
happy
I believe the lower you guys can pick it
up like I said definitely definitely
purchase from the Ulta website because
you get free goodies with it but I will
link the support link as well just in
case you guys want to order in there so
I hope you guys enjoyed this video if
you did please give it a thumbs up and
I'll see you in my next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
