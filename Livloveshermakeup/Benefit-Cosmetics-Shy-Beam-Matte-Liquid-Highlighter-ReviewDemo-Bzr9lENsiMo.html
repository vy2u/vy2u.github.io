thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having a fantastic day I am
here to give you guys a review and also
a demo on the new benefit dandelion
Scheibe this is a nude pink matte
radiance highlighter and yes what drew
me in was the fact that it is a matte
highlighter I feel like most
highlighters are either really really
glittery or they have just a really nice
Sheen to them I usually prefer the ones
to have like a really really nice like
finely milled sheen but I was very very
excited to try this I will admit that
liquid products in general especially
face products are not my favorite so I
was a little hesitant to pick this up
but I'm really happy that I did it is
taken a little getting used to but I
have come to the conclusion that I think
it's pretty good I think that if you use
it with a product like today I'm wearing
a pretty heavy duty coverage foundation
and I want to show you guys what it
looks like with that because I noticed
that any sort of like cream product that
I put on top of a powder usually
sometimes starts to break up on my face
and I thought that it's not horrible
with this particular product but that's
because I found a good way to use it so
I'll show you guys that when I demo it
but this is what the box looks like I
think it's really really cute I think I
would have preferred if they had done
the all pink everywhere but really
really cute and this products only $26
um I think the benefit has always had
really really nicely priced items
they've never really gone crazy I don't
think there's anything really that's
over fifty dollars from benefit am I
wrong I really think that they are
pretty low in price as far as Sephora go
so I'm going to read you guys a little
bit about what it says on the actual
support rate at Sephora website it says
this is a nude pink matte radiance
highlighter it says put your complexion
in the spotlight with this soft baby
pink shimmer or less natural looking
highlighter benefits ivy is perfect for
contouring and it can be used under your
complexion products or as a spot
highlighter over makeup ideal for all
skin types this foolproof highlighter
can be swept on for subtle strobing or
to give luminosity for a healthy no
makeup glow apply should I mean we're
leg would naturally hit your face as in
your cheekbones above the lip below your
brow bones and along
temples down the bridge of your nose and
above your Cupid's bow and blend for a
soft Sheen so I will say right away I
have tried this a lot with products that
are a little lighter in coverage last
week I was wearing a foundation that was
a lot lighter in coverage and I thought
that this looked really really beautiful
with it this is um
it is definitely like a new pink sort of
color but I do notice there's a lot of
peachy undertones in it so if you are
fair skins like I am you're gonna notice
that this is really really beautiful
underneath your foundation I did not
wear it like that today but I have a
huge fan of under-eye concealers that
have like pink tones in them
specifically my Maybelline instant age
rewind eraser treatment in the
brightener shade I think this is
gorgeous and I find it has the same sort
of color match as the actual benefits
typing so let me show you guys the
packaging how adorable is this you guys
see that it's this beautiful peachy
light pink color and you do get um how
many Ounces point 33 ounces in here but
you have to think about it in a way that
it is a liquid product so it is probably
going to last you longer it has a little
dandelions on the side it's just so cute
like I just want to place this like in
the background on my video or something
it's just a really really cute so the
packaging is great and let me open it up
and show you guys the applicator it's
very typical to any of their liquid they
have like those liquid blushes they also
have their liquid highlighter it's very
much the same thing it's just a tiny
little like paint brush door thing and
this is what the color looks like you
guys will see it is very very peachy
it's got a little bit of nude and a
little bit of pink in it I want to show
you guys what the original dandelion
highlighting powder looks like this is
the real cheeky party palettes that
recently came out from felt benefits for
the holidays and in here you can see
that dandelion is right there this is a
lot more pink tones I noticed
and the actual liquid highlighter itself
so I actually use this dandelion shade
as a blush quite often that is what it
looks like let me go ahead and swatch it
for you guys because it just would be
too dark for me if I do say as a
highlight but there is the powder one
and then if I blend in this one there is
the highlight so I think they are quite
different in tone but you know that's
just my opinion I really do think that
if you have fair skin this can work for
you I saw a lot of reviews on the
website of people saying like you know
it's not gonna work for you because you
know it will blend right into your skin
it is very very similar to my skin tone
but I think the brightening properties
that it adds if especially if you wear
it underneath your makeup are really
really nice I noticed it also it locks
in longer and it lasts a lot longer if
it is underneath your makeup so my
favorite way to use it is to highlight
underneath my makeup I go down in the
v-shape so down to my bridge of my
eartha down down to my last row and then
up like towards my hairline right here
and then I will take it on my eyelids as
well and then I will take some on my
chin down the bridge of my nose and then
I will apply my foundation on top of
that and I think it just gives a
beautiful beautiful glow underneath the
skin if you have medium to deep skin
tones I definitely think you could get
away with wearing this on top of your
makeup I just think you need to be
careful to make sure that you are using
either a product that's pretty light in
coverage or not powdering your face too
much like I said today I'm wearing a bit
of a heavy heavier coverage foundation
it's from ELF it's the flawless like
complexion or something as flawless
complexion foundation I believe it is it
is definitely a medium to buildable full
coverage foundation but I wanted to show
you guys because I did set it with a lot
of powder I wanted to show you guys how
I would apply it because I think you can
still get away with applying it over you
know a heavy coverage powder and a heavy
coverage foundation but it's just not a
flawless looking as when you wear it
underneath so I'm going to go ahead and
demo it for you guys so how I do it is I
just take the little
applicator and we don't do the things
that thing that I did earlier brush that
on the back of my hand just to get the
product on there and then I'm going to
go ahead and take a damp Beauty sponge
you can use your Beauty Blender or this
one is the Real Techniques I love it and
I'm just going to dot into or tap into
that product on the back of my hand and
I'm going to apply that to my chin and
I'm going to get a little more or hold
on and put enough on there there way to
apply this they say to just take it
right onto your fingertips and blend
with your fingers but if you wear a
heavy or full coverage foundation and
powder you know that's not probably
going to work for you
alright so there we have a little more
product I'm gonna put that right onto my
cheek bone and blend so I'm sure you
guys can probably see what I mean when I
say it has the similar kind of coverage
and color as the Maybelline instant age
rewind because I actually do feel like
this gives a little bit of like a
concealing benefit which one I feel like
when you put it on top of your blush and
your you know powdered all that kind of
stuff it kind of starts to cover things
up so I just don't think it's it's
nearly as beautifully as it does if you
apply it underneath your foundation
which is like I said my favorite way to
do it because I think that it actually
does have a little bit of coverage and I
do like that don't get me wrong that's
why I think it's great you can actually
probably use it as your brightener or
concealer but putting it on top of
already set products just kind of
doesn't look super super beautiful
so I've done it now and you guys can't
see because I'm super super close up you
might be able to see but I haven't seen
that there it's a little bit of powder
that has lifted away and it's starting
to get a little splotchy and that is
because I do have a heavy coverage
foundation and a little bit of powder on
so I just don't like the way it applies
like that again if you are wearing a
lighter coverage foundation and things
like
that it will look really beautiful but
you guys can definitely see the color
it's very similar to my skintone however
it is just a little more pink tone and I
think that pink and peachy colors look
absolutely stunning especially if you
have fair skin and you really want to
conceal sometimes yellow products like
correctors and things like that just
don't really look good on our sort of
skin tone because they can be a little
too dark for us so this is a really
really nice option I'm gonna take a
little down the bridge of my nose and I
must say I think that like the concept
of everything is really really nice it's
just a beautiful kind of matte
correcting highlighter product so I
really really do like it I definitely
think it brightens the face up I think
you guys can probably see everything
looks really really nice and beautiful
and you can probably imagine how
gorgeous it looks underneath the eye if
you do the little triangle underneath
your makeup so I really do like it like
I said it did take me a while to get
used to this product because I was just
basically using it the wrong way I was
just putting it right on top of heavy
coverage products and it just looked it
started to break up it didn't look
pretty and it really didn't last
throughout the day whatsoever however
when I put it on like I said underneath
you can do it literally you could
conceal first you could use your
concealer and then put this on
underneath your eye area it doesn't cake
up it's got a really really beautiful
finely milled texture as long as it's
underneath the powder and it really less
a lot longer because you are setting it
in with powder so that's probably my
favorite way to use it I think that it
is very very pretty on the skin it's
just not as pretty as it could be right
now because I have tried it different
ways but I wanted to show you guys
because this was the makeup I was
wearing today and I didn't want to have
to literally wear different makeup to
demo it for you guys I wanted you guys
to see that it could work on top of your
makeup because it is technically a
highlight so anyway that is my review
and my demo on the new of benefits
dandelion matte
I later slash corrector concealer in my
opinion I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I'm a link below you guys can pick
this product up if you are interested
and I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
