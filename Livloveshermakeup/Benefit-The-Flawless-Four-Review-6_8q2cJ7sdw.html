I'm gonna be reviewing the new benefit
the flawless force act right now this is
on the Ulta website and also in the auto
stores for $24 I recently picked it up
because I thought it was really nice
that you could try out four of the top
selling makeup products from the benefit
line so inside you get the stay flawless
15 hour primer you get the fake up
concealer the hello flawless oxygen Wow
Foundation and the hello flawless powder
you also get a little brush and I
already kind of tossed mine because it's
kind of flimsy and I don't like it but
um you do get this little brush that
looks like that and it can be used for
like highlighting I think toss that I
can't remember if I did anyway I don't
have it up here with me but it's really
really small and flimsy I don't but
anyway so let me show you guys what you
get in here I will say these are like
nice to luck sized samples and not
sample but like sample sizes I would say
so I really really like them and I'll
let you guys know a little more about
the kit so the first thing you get is
the hello flawless oxygen Wow
brightening foundation it looks like
this and just you guys know the actual
kit comes in four different shades on
the website you can get ivory petal
honey and beige so it's kind of weird
because I feel like they don't really
cater to the deeper skin tones I don't
know if beige is dark enough
this is I'd read the whole kit I got
within ivory and um it is still a bit
dark for my skin of course that's just
an issue that I have was a lot of makeup
brands in general but just thought I'd
let you guys know but anyway the first
thing you get in the kit is the hello
flawless oxygen Wow brightening makeup
and I do like this this is a really nice
thin consistency it glides on
beautifully I found that it applied the
best with my Beauty Blender um however
it can also be applied with like a
kabuki brush flat top kabuki the 3d HD
from Sigma things like that I think
would you know apply this nicely like I
said it wasn't a little dark for me and
I'm not wearing it today but it was good
it was good enough and I would consider
purchasing a full size of this the next
thing you get in here is the stay
flawless 15 hour primer and it just kind
of pops up like this and it comes in
packaging
like this so you twist it up and you can
see that you get this like primer stick
that you are supposed to rub all over
your face so my issue with this is that
it glides on really nicely onto the skin
however when you kind of like touch it
or like Pat it in it's super super
sticky so if you have combination skin
or dry skin this is going to cling to
your dry patches and it's just gonna
look horrible
like it's just really not gonna look
good I don't recommend it so I would say
if you do have oily skin this may be
really nice because it really does
adhere and it makes sure that the
foundation and the other things that
you're going to be putting onto your
skin really adhere to your skin however
if you have combination or dry skin
you're not gonna like this because it
just really emphasized all of the dry
patches on my face and I have
combination skin so next I'm going to
talk about the fake up concealer this
comes like this and as you guys can see
you get the color kind of on the inside
and then I don't know if you can tell
but there's like this ring of clearness
or I want it and it's supposed to be
like a I think on the website it said
that it's supposed to be like a built-in
primer in there like it has some
hydration properties and it just makes
sure that it doesn't crease and whatnot
so that's what it looks like it really
glides on smoothly and it does blend in
nicely but as you guys can see this is a
little yellow for my skin but I did like
the fake up concealer and I would
consider purchasing that I think it
glides on nicely it did not settle into
any fine lines around my eyes it didn't
crease my makeup it actually was really
really nice so I would definitely
consider purchasing the full size of the
fake up and the last thing you get in
the kit besides that little flimsy brush
I talked about is the hello flawless
powder so it looks like this and you
just open it up like this and this
powder is really really smooth and
creamy it just blends in gorgeously
again it's a little like a tad yellow
for my actual complexion however it
really does have some coverage to it and
it's beautiful I mean it really is soft
and creamy and it really does cover up
imperfections on your face like it does
have a little bit of
coverage in there so really really like
that I would also consider purchasing
the full size of this so out of all four
things from you know $24 I think this
was just awesome because I ended up
liking three of the products and three
of them I would consider purchasing full
size I would not get a big size with
that brush I don't even think they
probably have a big size of the brush
they just threw a little a little one of
these brushes it's kind of like the
stuff you get in the physician's formula
boxes they just threw that in to apply
the powder with obviously I wouldn't
purchase that I don't even think they
would sell bad but I would not purchase
these day flawless 15-hour primer but I
would purchase the hello flawless oxygen
Wow foundation I would purchase the
hello flawless powder and I would
purchase the fake up concealer so I'm
gonna read for you guys a little more of
what it says on the auto website so it
says the flawless four it says twenty
four dollars and then it says it's an
Ulta exclusive it says take the
fast-track to flawless with Benefit
Cosmetics the flawless for primer
concealer foundation this set has
everything you need to fake a flawless
face ivory set includes a hello flawless
oxygen Wow and ivory I'm pure for sure
mini the hello flawless I love you I
bring the knee they stay flawless mini
and they fake up in a one light mini and
it says how to use hello flawless oxygen
Wow blend on to face with a brush of
fingertips hello flawless powder for
sheer natural finish sweep on with a
brush with light quick strokes blend
from the center of your face outward for
full coverage apply evenly all over
complexion blah blah blah stay flawless
concealer it says glide the innovative
primer stick to read I'm sorry the
primer glide this innovative primer
stick directly onto skin then
immediately apply foundation blend me
together onto the face and the fake up
concealer it's a stroke face up
underneath each eye using your ring
finger Pat gently outward to blend you
can also use it a touch up throughout
the day this double duty hydrating and
concealing formula won't cake crease or
settle so that's what it says on the
website like I said I purchased this for
$24 I think that's awesome because you
get to try it all four of these things
well five if you consider the little
flimsy brush but I mean I really think
it's worth it if you can find your
range I'm kind of disappointed they only
go to the deepest shade which is beige I
don't feel like deeper skin tones can
use that it's not catering to
everybody's skin tone but ivory worked
pretty well for me and I am happy so I
you know I think this is a great way to
try out products and see if you want to
purchase the full-size and I'm
definitely interested in three of the
four of these so I'm really really happy
I picked it up I hope you guys enjoyed
this review and I'll see you in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
