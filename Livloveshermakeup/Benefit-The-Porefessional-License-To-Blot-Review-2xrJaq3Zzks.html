thanks for joining me today I'm doing a
review on the new benefit the
Porefessional license to blot instant
oil blotting stick it comes in this
packaging and this is the actual little
tube it's super small I actually thought
it was going to be a lot bigger but I
purchased this for $20 on the
sephora.com website I will link below
where you guys can pick it up basically
what this is supposed to be is um an oil
blotting stick that has like spheres in
it that are supposed to help like cover
up oil and the thought is that you can
apply it before your foundation like a
primer basically on your oily spots or
you can even apply it during the day
kind of like oil blotting sheets like to
pick up certain areas that have gotten
really oily
now um it screws up like this you just
have this little thing and it screws up
like that and it kind of has like a
tacky texture to it because that's
what's gonna stop the oiliness it is
completely clear and see-through um and
it is smooth in some kind of way um it's
like quite describe the texture it's
tacky but at the same time it's smooth
so once you kind of rub it in it feels
more like the professional the actual
primer does and that's because it's
probably you know it's supposed to be
part of that pore fessional line but
anyway so basically how I've been using
this is I like to apply it with my
primer so say I'm using the professional
primer I will apply this first and then
I applied the primer over that I like to
apply it in the areas where I get really
oily which are my chin down my nose the
sides of my nose and then a little bit
right here between my brows and I find
that this does help to control oil
during the day it's similar to the Becca
ever matte poreless priming Perfector
yes it's similar to that it's not as
heavy duty as that it's not as tacky
it's not as crazy oil absorbing but if
this does work I will say right away I
have tried putting it on over my makeup
like say my makeup starting to break
down a little bit like on the sides of
my face I've tried putting it there and
it just wipes away the makeup it does
not work like that so I highly recommend
if you are going to use it do it um
before you put on your makeup that's the
best way to use it
says it's an invisible finish and it's
poor perfecting instant oil blotting
stick and yeah so let me read for you
guys a little bit what it says on the
Sephora website also um it says an
instant oil blotting stick for a
mattified complexion by the way this
goes for 20 dollars on the website I
don't remember if I mentioned that yet
and it says what it's formulated to do
the instant oil blotting stick with tiny
invisible blotting spheres mattes pop
mattifies shine for up to six hours
after application the specifically
designed triangular tip targets shiny
zones the sides of your nose forehead
and chin for smooth flawless application
so it's really made to get into those
little crevices and it's free of
parabens sulfates and blend the
professional primer all over your face
to minimize the appearance of pores and
target oily spots um with license to
blot sweep on Agent Zero shine powder
all over personal control so it's
telling you that basically you need to
get all three products from the
professional line which you don't need
to do you really can just pick the ones
that you want to use um and it says in a
consumer panel survey on thirty women
over seven days a hundred percent stock
continuous mattifying action 97% said it
helped minimize the look of pores and a
hundred percent said it absorbs excess
surface oils so like I said it does
absorb excess surface oils I don't think
it really blurs out my pores like the
actual primer does but I do notice that
it helps it helps you know if you have
oil that breaks through your makeups
throughout the day this really helps so
that that doesn't happen throughout the
day so I do like it for that um like I
said I was hoping that it'd be one of
those things I could just because it's
so small to just pop out of my purse and
during the day do touch-ups but they
recommend using like a stiff kind of
swift action when doing this and it
basically just wipes away your makeup no
matter if you wear a little bit or a lot
today I'm just wearing um a BB cream and
it wipes that away too so it really
doesn't matter how much makeup you wear
this will wipe it away so overall I'd
give this like game six out of a ten
because I feel like it does claim to do
things that it actually doesn't do like
it
at work to do it over makeup and that's
kind of why I wanted in the first place
however it is nice if you are going to
use it before putting on your primer it
does help so that throughout the day
especially in the warmer months we're
coming into spring and summer it helps
to make sure that oil doesn't break
through or that your makeup doesn't
start to let the oils break through your
skin during the day so overall I give it
like they send five or six out of ten um
I do like it I'm obviously not gonna
return it because I have been using it
and I do like it and yeah um that is my
review I hope you guys enjoyed this if
you did give this video a thumbs up and
I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
