video on my favorite facial mask for
when you're breaking out I've currently
been experiencing some really hormonal
acne around my cheeks and kind of on my
chin and so I've been adding a lot of
face mask skin usually like two or three
times a week to help clear those areas
up I think that you know just using a
like a facial cleanser and overnight
cleansing pads and things like that can
only do so much sometimes you really do
want to get a nice facial mask on your
skin when you're breaking out and just
let it sit there for a good you know 30
to 45 minutes so let me just share my
top picks with you guys and let's just
get started so the first one is from
acne free it is called the therapeutic
sulfur mask with vitamin C and copper
and this comes in a really tiny little
tube like this but I find this to be
really really helpful it comes out kind
of like a whitish color and it has these
tiny little blue beads in it and so when
you apply it to your skin it does kind
of smell like sulfur it's gross smelling
but when you apply it all over your skin
and you rub those beads in they turn
blue and then what happens is the mask
hardens on your face and you leave it
there for about 15 to 20 minutes and
then you wash it off and I swear to you
um the size of the pimples and the
redness will be greatly diminished and I
really really love this I also like to
sometimes use this as just a spot
treatment because it is such a small you
know such a small little container and
sometimes just can't justify using it as
a mask so you know I do like this as a
spot treatment as well so basically it
says here the active ingredient is
solved for 3.5 percent which is nice in
case you are you know sensitive to like
clay masks or salicylic acid benzoyl
peroxide things like that this is a
different ingredients offers really nice
to draw out impurities and on the back
it says penetrates deep into the pores
to soothe and help heal acne inflamed
skin cools and tightens as it absorbs
excess oils and deep cleanses clogged
pores leave skin feeling smooth ER and
refresh
and I totally agree with this and this
one really doesn't dry my skin out at
all it really does help just you know
diminish the size of my pimples and I
really really like it for when I
breaking out so that's my first pick my
second pick is from Freeman it is the
facial clay mask with mint and lemon and
you can get this at bed bath and beyond
for three or four dollars and this is
huge compared to the acne free one and I
mean this is like twelve dollars this is
you know three or four so love this it
smells amazing it smells like lemon and
mint and I really really love just the
feeling that it leaves when I put it on
and it's kind of like a turquoise color
and you just apply it to your skin and
you leave it on for 10 20 30 minutes and
i think this one really really really
helps with oil control you can feel a
little dry after you use this one but it
really helps with oil control so
sometimes when you break out it is
because of excess sebum in the skin or
excess oil on the skin so this can be
very very helpful and it says here it
clears breakouts and minimizes the
appearance of pores it says this lemony
cool play mass delivers relief from
inflammation caused by breakouts clay
absorbs oils to minimize shine in the
appearance of large pores mint and lemon
cool and refresh perfect for breakout
prone and oily skin so really really
love that one really cheap alternative
and it's awesome and then another one
that I think everybody knows about and
you can also get a bed bath and beyond
well you can actually get all three of
these products but these are similar in
price and size this is the queen helene
mint julep mask this is really really
popular and you get this big container
this is probably about four or five
dollars and it is just this green
minting ask really thick kind of pace
there and you put it all over and you
leave it on for you know 20 to 30
minutes and this one really really if
you have oily skin this is going to
combat that like instantly it doesn't
really leave the skin to dry it really
does feel refreshing because of the mint
in there it really feels nice when you
it off but this is really really great
for oil control i would say better than
the other two now i don't notice that
this is amazing when it comes to like
diminishing pimples i do notice however
that it does help keep my my skin clear
but if i have like a big pimple like
that the best mascot of all three of
these is definitely the acne free sulfur
mask i would say if you have um you know
oily just oily problems and you just
want to help diminish like pores get the
Fremen mask and if you're having like
you know just really really oily skin
but you do want to help even out the
complexion get the mint julep mask this
is also really nice for enlarged pores
and things like that all three of them
do in the end help with pimples and acne
but they also help combat you know
whaley skin and things like that which
usually leads to acne so anyway so this
is the mint julep mask anna says it
helps dry up acne pimples so it does
help dry it up I don't think it dries it
up as quickly as the acne free salt for
mass but this does help and it says it
rinses away blackheads and shrinks
enlarged pores and I definitely agree
with the shrinks and large pores I
really think the mint in there just
really helps especially around my t-zone
I get pretty enlarged pores and I see
that they are actually diminished in
size after using this so on the back of
says mint julep masque is the original
natural home treatment developed by a
dermatologist that helps dry up acne
pimples rinse away blackheads and shrink
at large pores simply applied mint julep
mask to your clean face and neck within
minutes at firms and hardens drawing out
impurities from your force after the
mask is removed your skin will feel
clean refreshed and smooth even for
individual individuals who are
fortunately frio skin problems mint
julep mask is a refreshing facial
treatment that helps relax tired muscles
and ease tension lines in the face and
neck and these two are clay masks so
they really do you know draw out
impurities so even if you don't have
oily skin or even if you just don't have
tons of acne problems these two masks
are still really nice clay really goes
in and just draws out the toxins from
your
again so these are really good for
basically every I would say all all
types of skin I would say if you're
really really dry probably stay away
from clay mask and definitely stay away
from sulfur mask this is really for
acne-prone oily skin and all of them can
be used for that but i think these you
know can probably be used by everyone
and the last thing i wanted to mention
was more for after you have your
breakouts and you are left with a lovely
little red mark on your skin this is the
mario badescu whitening mask this is a
basically what it is is it is a
whitening treatment and you applied it
all over and it helps paid dark spots
and it smells like raspberries it is
like a white oh no no if that's going to
show up there we go white a goopy what
super goo peas kind of smooth it's
really nice when you apply it it's very
very smooth but as you can see I've used
a lot of this I love this I really think
it works well I noticed that after I go
through a set of breakouts like I am
right now and I use something like this
for about a week after I don't notice as
much you know the scarring is much less
visible and I really really appreciate
that so let me just read on the back
here it says brighten up uneven or dull
skin with regular use of this creamy
hydrating mask the skin lightening
powers of kojic acid licorice extract
and grape extract help reduce minor
hyperpigmentation and acne scarring
while soothing botanicals calm inflamed
and sensitive skin apply a thin layer
and clean skin avoiding eye area wait 10
minutes and rinse thoroughly with tepid
water use two to three times a week so
really really like this I think it
really does help after you've gone
through either hormonal or if you just
have pimples in general you know we're
all kind of left with either a dark
brownish mark or a pink mark I get
really pink red marks that take months
to go away so I really really like to
have a mass like that also so those were
the let's see I guess for masks that I
use when I'm breaking out or when my
skin is just really acting up and being
oily and just obnoxious mostly just
hormonal acne
and I hope this helped let me know below
what you guys think and if you've tried
any of these masks I know these two are
like cult favorites so let me know if
you've tried them and i'll see you guys
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
