video on my favorite facial masks for
when you're breaking out I've currently
been experiencing some really hormonal
acne around my cheeks and kind of on my
chin and so I've been adding a lot of
face masks and usually like 2 or 3 times
a week to help clear those areas up I
think that you know just using like a
facial cleanser and overnight cleansing
pads and things like that can only do so
much sometimes you really do want to get
a nice facial mask on your skin when
you're breaking out and just let it sit
there for a good you know 30 to 45
minutes so let me just share my top
picks with you guys and let's just get
started so the first one is from acne
free it is called the therapeutic
sulphur mask with vitamin C and copper
and this comes in a really tiny little
tube like this but I find this to be
really really helpful
it comes out kind of like a whitish
color and it has these tiny little blue
beads in it and so when you apply it to
your skin it does kind of smell like
sulfur it's gross smelling but when you
apply it all over your skin and you rub
those beads in they turn blue and then
what happens is the mask hardens on your
face and you leave it there for about
fifteen to twenty minutes and then you
wash it off and I swear to you the size
of the pimples and the redness will be
greatly diminished and I really really
love this I also like to sometimes use
this as just a spa treatment because it
is such a small you know such a small
little container and sometimes just
can't justify using it as a mask
so you know I do like this as a spot
treatment as well so basically it says
here the active ingredient is salt 43.5%
which is nice in case you are you know
sensitive to like clay masks or
salicylic acid benzoyl peroxide things
like that this is a different ingredient
sulfur is really nice to draw out
impurities and on the back it says
penetrates deep into the pores to soothe
and help heal acne inflamed skin cools
and tightens as it absorbs excess oils
and deep cleanses clogged pores leave
skin feeling smoother and refresh and I
totally agree with this and
this one really doesn't dry my skin out
at all it really does help just you know
diminish the size of my pimples and I
really really like it for when I'm
breaking out so that's my first pick my
second pick is from Freeman it is the
facial clay mask with mint and lemon and
you can get this at Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond
for three or four dollars and this is
huge compared to the acne free one and I
mean this is like $12 this is you know
three or four so love this it smells
amazing it smells like lemon and mint
and I really really love just the
feeling that it leaves when I put it on
and it's kind of like a turquoise color
and you just apply it to your skin and
you leave it on for 10 20 30 minutes and
I think this one really really really
helps with oil control you can feel a
little dry after you use this one but it
really helps with oil control so
sometimes when you break out it is
because of excess sebum in the skin or
excess oil in the skin so this can be
very very helpful and I says here it
clears breakouts and minimizes the
appearance of pores it says this lemony
cool play mask delivers relief from
inflammation caused by breakouts clay
absorbs oils to minimise shine in the
appearance of large pores mint and lemon
cool and refresh perfect for breakout
prone and Whateley skin so really really
love that one really cheap alternative
and it's awesome and then another one
that I think everybody knows about and
you can also get a bed bath and beyond
well you can actually get all three of
these products but these are similar in
price and size this is the queen howleen
mint julep mask this is really really
popular and you get this big container
and this is probably about four or five
dollars and it is just this green minty
mask really thick kind of paste there
and you put it all over and you leave it
on for you know twenty to thirty minutes
and this one really really if you have
oily skin this is going to combat that
like instantly it doesn't really leave
the skin to dry it really does feel
refreshing because of the mint in there
it really feels nice when you
wash it off but this is really really
great for oil control I would say better
than the other two now I don't notice
that this is amazing when it comes to
like diminishing pimples I do notice
however that it does help keep my my
skin clear but if I have like a big
pimple like that the best mascot of all
three of these is definitely the acne
freeze sulfur mask I would say if you
have you know oily just oily problems
and you just want to help diminish like
pores get the Fremen mask and if you're
having like you know just really really
oily skin but you do want to help even
out the complexion get the mint tulip
mask this is also really nice for
enlarged pores and things like that all
three of them do in the end help with
pimples and acne but they also help
combat you don't lightly skin and things
like that which usually leads to acne so
anyway so this is the mint julep mask
and it says it helps dry up acne pimples
so it does help dry it up I don't think
it dries it up as quickly as the acne
free salt for masks but this does help
and it says it rinses away blackheads
and shrinks enlarged pores and I
definitely agree with the shrinks
enlarged pores I really think the mint
in there just really helps especially
around my t-zone I get pretty enlarged
pores and I see that they are actually
diminished in size after using this so
on the back it says mint julep mask is
the original natural home treatment
developed by a dermatologist that helps
dry up acne pimples rinse away
blackheads and shrink enlarged pores
simply apply even julep masks to your
clean face and neck within minutes it
firms and hardens drying out impurities
from your pores after the mask is
removed your skin will feel clean
refreshed and smooth even for individual
individuals who are fortunately free of
skin problems mint julep mask is a
refreshing facial treatment that helps
relax tired muscles and ease tension
lines in the face and neck and these two
are clay masks so they really do you
know draw out impurities so even if you
don't have oily skin or even if you just
don't have tons of acne problems these
two masks are still really nice
clay really goes in and just draws out
the Thompsons from your skin so these
are really good for basically every I
would say all all types of skin I would
say if you're really really dry probably
stay away from clay masks and definitely
stay away from sulfur masks this is
really for acne prone oily skin all of
them can be used for that but I think
these you know can probably be used by
everyone and the last thing I wanted to
mention was more for after you have your
breakouts and you are left with a lovely
little red mark on your skin this is the
Mario Badescu whitening mask this is a
basically what it is is it is a
whitening treatment and you applied it
all over and it helps fade dark spots
and it smells like raspberries it is
like a white oh no no that's gonna show
up there we go white goopy what super
goopy it's kind of smooth it's really
nice when you apply it it's very very
smooth but as you can see I've used a
lot of this I love this I really think
it works well I noticed that after I go
through a set of breakouts like I am
right now and I use something like this
for about a week after I don't notice as
much you know the scarring is much less
visible and I really really appreciate
that so let me just read on the back
here it says brighten up uneven or dull
skin with regular use of this creamy
hydrating mask the skin lightening
powers of kojic acid licorice extract
and grape extract help reduce minor
hyperpigmentation and acne scarring
while soothing botanicals calm inflamed
and sensitive skin apply a thin layer on
clean skin avoiding eye area wait 10
minutes and rinse thoroughly with tepid
water use 2 to 3 times a week so really
really like this I think it really does
help after you've gone through either
hormonal or if you just have pimples in
general you know we're all kind of left
with either a dark brownish mark or a
pink mark I get really pink red marks
that take months to go away so I really
really like to have a mass like that
also so those were the let's say I guess
four masks that I use when I'm breaking
out or when my skin is just really
acting
being oily and just obnoxious mostly
just hormonal acne and I hope this
helped let me know below what you guys
think and if you've tried any of these
masks I know these two are like cult
favorites so let me know if you've tried
them and I'll see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
