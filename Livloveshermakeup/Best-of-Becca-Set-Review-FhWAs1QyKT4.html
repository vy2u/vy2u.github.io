you guys today I am sorry if I sound
really stuffed-up I actually did get
sick on the way over here I'm in a
different location different state right
now I got sick on the plane over here so
if I sound stuffed up or if I look a
little sick I am anyway I wanted to film
another review for you guys this time it
is going to be a kit that is being sold
on ultra calm exclusively and it is the
best of becca kit so Becca cosmetics
came out with this kit and I think it's
awesome basically it is four of their
top-selling products from Becca
cosmetics like I said I purchased mine
on Alta calm i will read few guys on the
back what you get so you get a
shimmering skin Perfector pressed in
rose gold which is a creamy luminizing
powder that they'll skin and they soft
pearl eyes glow with the illustrious
development finish it's a sweep across
space or apply to targeted areas for
refined luminosity and light you also
get a shimmering skin Perfector
spotlight which is um like a wet product
it's not like the press product and it
is in the color opal and it says this
portable liquid highlighter features
ultrafine light reflecting pearls that
melt into your skin for polished
natural-looking radiance using the wand
to have a small amount all over the high
points of your face and it can also be
mixed with moisturizer or a foundation
for an all-over glow and the next thing
you get is the Beca beach tint in guava
which is a water-resistant cream stain
that tense lips and cheeks with a
natural wash of color layers under
powder blushes beach tint shimmer
souffle bronzer or lip products for
added intensity and then the last thing
you get is the beach tint shimmer
souffle in watermelon / moonstone and it
is a pop of luminescent color in an air
whipped cheeks to play this water
resistant formula provides effortlessly
buildable color with a soft lustrous
finish apply with becca's the one
perfecting brush for a wash of color or
your fingertips for a more intense path
color so that shows what you get I think
this is such a waste of packaging
because you only get like deluxe kind of
sizes of products this is actually
full-sized but most of them are like
deluxe eyes I just think that that box
is so big and clunky anyway so let's
just get star
I'm going to start with what's they
listed first which is the shimmering
skin Perfector pest in rose gold it
comes in little packaging like this if
you guys are familiar with their pressed
um you know highlighters in general I
have moonstone a lot of people have opal
they come in packaging like this except
they're much bigger so this is a little
smaller size and I believe rose gold
this one particularly is a limited
edition shade and you want to get your
hands on it because fam it's beautiful
do you guys see how gorgeous that is it
is just super super bronzy really really
beautiful just i love it i love love
love it i am am wearing it today on the
tops of my cheekbones and i think it
just gives such a nice warm glow to the
skin even on really really fair skin
like mine so that is what the shimmering
a skin Perfector looks like beautiful
absolutely love love love it the second
products you get is the shimmering skin
Perfector a spotlight which is the
liquid formula of a highlighter and this
is an opal opal is like a cult classic
called favorite shade from Becca a lot
of people get it in the press format
it's a really really popular
highlighting shade like I said I only
have the moonstone one and depressed you
know compact but now I guess I have this
one to the rose gold but you can get it
in this liquid form and I really love
this this looks so natural on the skin
you get this nice little applicator
that's super super thin but it's flat on
each side and it just pops color on
beautifully and basically this is like a
nice nudey like undertone it's not
nearly as strong as that rose gold and
not nearly as deep but it just gives a
beautiful warm glow to the skin on most
people like most skin tones if you have
medium skin tone to dark skin tone this
is going to look like nice and light the
reason I never picked this up in the
pressed format and the reason i picked
up moonstone was because moonstone is a
little lighter and i do have fair skin
so I thought that would work better for
me but I absolutely love this liquid one
I am wearing on my chin today little
down
knows I think it's absolutely beautiful
and this is a really nice size so really
really happy with that it just gives a
beautiful beautiful glow and I can
imagine mixing that with foundation
would just give gorgeous gorgeous you
know complexion just I I'm gonna have to
try that during the summer the next
thing you get in here is the beach tint
in guava these are really really popular
obviously these are the best from becca
but people talk about this all the time
so basically it's just a little squeezy
tube and you can use this on your lips
you can use it on your cheeks and it is
this gorgeous gorgeous color and you
just need the smallest amount and it's
so light and creamy it feels like butter
and it just gives this beautiful
beautiful tint smells pretty good too um
and it's just beautiful it's like this
nice light pink flushed I just you know
wait for a run on the beach kind of look
um and I just I really really love it it
really does stain that's why I wanted to
wipe it off right away I think it's
gorgeous and lips gorgeous on the cheeks
if you're about to go out and you know
do some swimming or something like that
this is perfect for a day at the beach
of course it's a beach tint it's perfect
so that is the color guava I just think
it's it's really really beautiful and
you know it's not like one of those
tacky sticky stains it's really really
creamy and gorgeous and the last thing
you get in this kick is the beach tint
shimmer souffle and this is another
sorry I have to open that another really
popular product from becca it does smell
like watermelon and it's funny because
the color combination is watermelon /
moonstone so moonstone is that nice
light um you know highlighting color I
was talking about earlier so basically
it's mixed in there with this beautiful
watermelon color and it really does
smell like watermelon and this is what
it looks like and oh my gosh beautiful
do you guys see that like it is so
beautiful that color is just so natural
i think becca has really done a great
job with putting out products that
really just look natural on the skin
these are going to be great during the
summer
you know it's like this beautiful creamy
texture you can kind of poke at it and
like you know it's kind of like those
dream bouncy blushes from the drugstore
and I just love it I love the texture of
the pigmentation is beautiful I actually
applied it with a brush today that's my
cheek color my blush and I think it's so
natural it's so beautiful it's one of
those things that you know you can layer
with that beach tint where this
underneath and then put that on top
those two go beautifully together and
it's also one that you know it looks
beautiful with this rose gold I'm
highlighter I just think this is so easy
and wonderful and I love the thought and
concept of it I believe this is a
full-size and it you know it's just
great it's like this nice little glass
container it just feels good feels
high-end it's beautiful it's unlike
anything I really have and I love it so
anyway that was my review my thoughts on
this new little kit that Becca came out
with the best of Becca kid I think it's
awesome I absolutely love this kit I
just think it's it's great I can't stop
looking at this gorgeous rose gold
highlighter look at that so gorgeous so
anyway really really happy with that
highly recommended if you guys can pick
it up I'm not quite sure when Alta is
going to stop selling this somebody said
they stopped selling it a few days ago
but if I can find a link for it I will
link it below and yeah that's my thought
on you know this little set from Becca I
hope you guys enjoyed this and I'll see
my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
