I am going to be reviewing the new bites
beauty butter cream lipstick with
reverse at all Lulu fancy this is what
the packaging looks like i purchased
mine for $28 on the sephora website yes
you heard that correct twenty-eight
dollars that's pretty darn expensive
compared to like their dual ended um
like lipsticks those are like twelve
dollars so when I saw that this was 28 I
was like ah I don't know I'm just gonna
order one to see how it goes because you
know I ordered online what if I don't
like it just kind of start with one so
the color I picked up was Heather which
is this beautiful um it's described as a
dusty rose on the actual Sephora website
it's just these gorgeous gorgeous color
I am rain it today on my lips and oh my
goodness I love this formula I love the
color I love everything about this
lipstick you guys I'm not kidding I love
it I'm definitely going to pick up some
more shades that is a swatch beautiful
super super high pigment it's got kind
of a sweet texture and taste to it and
it smells good and it's by duty i mean i
wouldn't expect you know anything less
than wonderfulness so I mean I was kind
of surprised that I really only wanted
to order one because like I said um you
know I love by beauty and I just knew
that I would love this but because it
was twenty-eight dollars i really wanted
to make sure that it was something I
really wanted to invest in since it is
just a lipstick so basically these are
supposed to be hand cut so they have
like a little sticker on the top of it
when you open it up the says hand cut
the thought is that any other lipstick
you open it up later here I have a buxom
lip stick you open it up and everything
at the top nothing it's it's cut a
certain way so that you don't get any of
like the good beneficial nutrients and
that nutrients but you know what I mean
like the essential oils or whatever they
put in here that's going to moisturize
your lips so the thought process of
these hand-cut lipsticks is that it's
going to UM they cut it literally like
right there so you know you don't get
like the point to top what
actually could make it harder to apply
on the actual lip because it's just like
a blunt you know big thing and if you
have smaller kind of lips like I do it
can be kind of difficult but it's not is
that if you just cut it bluntly you get
the nutrients and you get the oils that
you don't get from the top of the
lipstick so you get it all throughout
the whole thing if that makes sense so
um I don't know I don't know if that's
the thing I don't really care how the
lipstick is cut um I think that I can
work with it either way if it's too
blunt like this I can just take a lip
brush and apply but um I find that this
still goes on nicely and doesn't
completely overwhelm my lips or go
outside my lip line i will say i do
prefer to use it with a lip liner
because it does feather a tiny tiny bit
but um I'm just so happy with it like it
says it is a buttercream and you guys
these are smoother than those dual ended
lipsticks if that's even possible by
beauty makes some of the best textured
lipsticks lip products in general lip
glosses everything lip products okay
they make some of the best textured lip
products ever and this one is absolutely
no exception it is actually smoother and
creamier than any of their other
lipsticks it's completely like um you
know there's not like sparkle in here
but it leaves like a sheen because it's
so moisturizing it's so beautiful the
formula is just to die for I'm
definitely going to pick up some more
the packaging is kind of like magnetic
can you see that so you go like this
boom magnetic love that I think it's
really sleek and nice it just says bite
on there and I really really just I'm
obsessed so basically on the Sephora
website they have one two three four
five six seven eight yes eight different
really nice neutral colors so Heather is
described as a um ooh where is it as a
dusty rose they also have rosewood which
is like a plummy rose color they have
cream which is an almond nude they have
marzipan which is the milky chocolate
Heather of course mine which is dusty
rose then they have pecan which is a
warm dusty pink it's pretty close to
Heather and then they have mocha which
is a war
I'm dark brown they have caramel which
is a fleshy nude and they have hazelnut
which is a brown pink so these are all
really really neutral colors there are
no bright colors that you can pick out
of the lineup everything is very neutral
it almost looks like boring just looking
at the ones it's like oh they all look
so similar like brown and you know
whatever but they're just they really
mimic like the lips like my lips but
better time things so I really really
like it let me read for you guys a
little bit what it says on these for
website of course it says the bite
Beauty butter cream lipstick $28 what it
is a creamy lipstick in Universal nude
and neutral shades enhance your natural
lip color with bites butter cream
lipstick to achieve the creamiest
lipstick bite developed a technique to
hand cut each bullet removing the outer
waxy later to expose each lipsticks
impossibly creamy corn I'm fused with
five nourishing I'm a romantic a
romantic a Roman Roman it's like a Rome
at a row modeling I get it you like the
smell of it aromatic I don't even know
aromatic butters including lavender shea
almond pomegranate and chamomile on this
hand cut and flat tipped bullet delivers
portable easy application in a range of
universal wearable nudes and neutrals
that leave a silky finish what else you
need to know i'm suzanne lengua the
founder and CEO of bite beauty said I
was obsessed with creating the creamiest
lipstick texture ever possible and when
i created this hand cut technique in the
lab I knew it was the one it creates a
texture that is hands-down habit-forming
hands that is hands-down habit-forming
nothing I've ever tried compares to this
impossibly creamy texture filled with
good for you ingredients so I really do
like that bite is into using you know
shea butter and chamomile and all these
kind of things that's what makes their
products also slick smell kind of fruity
and really yummy and I just think it
it's nice like it's nice you know
everything is just wonderful about this
sorry about that somebody was facetiming
me oh but yes this is my review I hope
you guys enjoyed this video of the bite
Beauty butter cream lipstick
I will leave everything below where you
guys can pick it up and i'll see you in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
