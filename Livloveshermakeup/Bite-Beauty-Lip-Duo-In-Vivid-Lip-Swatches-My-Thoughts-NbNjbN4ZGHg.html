thought today I go ahead and do a like I
will not Squatch it but um actually put
it on my lips it's just one of these
double ended bite beauty lipsticks this
is Palomino and violet I wanted to just
show you guys what they look like on I
absolutely adore the formula so um I
thought I just show you guys the color
payoff it's amazing so this is violent
this is silent
beautiful super creamy it feels like
butter on your lips like these are the
best for almost four lipsticks like in
my opinion ever so I'm going to take
that off now and show you the other one
the other side is Palomino which is a
beautiful beautiful pink color that
looks very pink on my lips because I
have pink undertone for a so let me show
you this is Palomino basically matches
my robe
this is Palomino beautiful really true
to color I'm super creamy it like I said
it just feels like like a butter on your
lips so I highly recommend these I think
these are only like twelve dollars right
now at Sephora this is the duo called
vivid I highly recommend recommend this
one but they also have with a new one
and they also have just you know
different colored ones they have lip
glosses things like that so there's just
a kind of little review and watching on
my lips so you guys can see and hope you
guys enjoyed this video see you next
