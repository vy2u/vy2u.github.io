have a review for you guys some arm
swatches and lip swatches for the bite
Beauty lush lip trio with reverse' troll
it says this is an instant nutrition for
lips lush lip glosses are 99% natural
they are made with real fruit for
luscious goodness you could eat so it
comes in this cute little pouch like
this and I just love it I think that's
adorable and you get 3 glasses on the
inside and honestly I must say because
on the back it does say that these are
great for like moisturization these
glasses are moisturizing I'm telling you
right now they will help with like dry
lips and I noticed that really just with
like by beauty products in general this
is my first time using their glosses and
I think that the pigmentation isn't the
best it could be but honestly because it
doesn't waster eyes your lips and on top
of that the formula oh my gosh white
beauty formulas if this formula is like
the same as the lip crayons and the
double-ended lipstick everything is just
so creamy all the time so like I said
pigmentation isn't the best but you know
these moisturize your lips and they just
have that great formula so anyway here
are the swatches umm please excuse this
area over here those Urban Decay
swatches will not come off you guys I
have scrubbed they're not going anywhere
anyway here are the three swatches so
you have kind of this mauve color here
you have a bright pink in the middle
and then over here you have a neutral
and the colors are let's see here that
mauve color the first one there is
called oh my gosh you guys I hate them
because the stamp over the name is
called krint uh-huh and the middle color
which is the pink is called strawberry
and the rambutan is the tan shade over
there
so um like I said these are really
really nice they're super super creamy I
think I'll just go the way that the
swatches are so I will start with
current and I will place my lips
and these taste and smell amazing
so that's current as you can see they're
not overly shiny which is nice I don't
find them sticky at all it feels like I
just put like a lip butter on it's
amazing but I would say this one is kind
of disappointing with the color payoff
it's the hardest to work up in the
swatch and on the lips but um overall
it's good and if I'm not wearing
anything on my lips I can just top you
know top my lips off with that and it
would look put together so current right
next is strawberry which is that pink
color in the middle
strawberry I would say this one has the
best segmentation out of all of them you
can definitely work up the color and you
can do it a little more sheer and get a
dark pink or you could work it up even
more into like a light baby pink so
that's strawberry
all right and the last one is around
Bhutan rambutan rambutan rom boo 8ra m
bu T a n rambutan around town
what is that if anybody knows Liesman
leave it in the comments please so
that's the last one swatch there it's
kind of like a peachy nude I'd say
this is rambutan Pendleton very very
pretty it's kind of like uh I would say
it's a nude color I would say current is
my lips the better
the strawberry one is just like a bright
pink color and then wrap around the time
wrong I feel like it's wrong Bhutan not
around the town from Bhutan is a nice
like peachy nude color so those are all
these swatches um you guys heard my
Posse for like I said I don't think
they're as pigmented as they could be I
really expect a lot of pigmentation when
it comes to by beauty but honestly the
formula is really kind of what we keep
buying for if it was what I keep lying
for for at least when it comes to you
bite Beauty and the formulation stays
the same
like consistently throughout all of
their lip products including these so I
do like them and I think it's great that
they help moisturize the lips they're
not too shiny these are like my little
lip trio uh what would I say these are
like moisturizing new lip gloss trio so
I know I can grab them if I need you
know some things but um you can also top
them off with like some sort of a lip
stick and of course it will look really
good because it will give some extra
shine and a little extra color but
anyway so that was the bite lush lip
trio I hope you guys enjoyed this I
purchased this on Sephora calm hopefully
you can still get it there and I will
see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
