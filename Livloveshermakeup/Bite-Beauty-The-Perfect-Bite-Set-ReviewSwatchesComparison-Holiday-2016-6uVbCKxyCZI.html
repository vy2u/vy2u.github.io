video is going to be a review swatches
and also a comparison on the new bite
Beauty the perfect bite set I purchased
this for $25 on the sephora.com website
as always I will link down below where
you guys can pick it up as well if you
are interested it is a $59 value it is
exclusive it is new and it is limited
edition right now I think it's only
available for VIP Rouge members but I
don't know if that will change you to
get 4 deluxe eyes and Musa Bush
lipsticks in here and there are four of
them and they equal out 2.05 ounces
which is the same size as the lip
pencils from the 2014 holiday collection
um this is what it looks like the outer
packaging these are supposed to be
high-impact lipsticks they deliver
extreme moisture sublime texture and
also a very creamy finish and wear time
you do get two nude shades in here a
rosy pink and also a cognac Brown in
case you were curious so if you have
purchased these little bite Beauty lip
sets during the holiday season you know
they all come with a little sleeve and
then they come in this adorable little
magnetic red um case I guess you could
call it it does have point a big mirror
which i think is nice and I have all of
my cases from 2014-2015 and now I have
two 2016 you do get a little sheet right
here that tells you the names of the
shades that you get which are fig pepper
honeycomb and nori these are not new or
exclusive shades they are exclusive to
this particular kids but they are not
new and then this is what it looks like
on the inside
now I have gone ahead and done some
swatches over here at the 2016 set I
have the 2015 set here and then I have
some shady a swatches of the 2014 here I
will say right away I don't think that
there are huge color variances in here
like I feel like the colors are very
very similar to one another however I
will say if you are a big fan of by
beauty like Ivers Liam that I think this
is a great kit to pick up by Beauty
consistently in my opinion brings out
some really really good lip products I
personally really enjoy my videos you
can probably tell I really like their
fruit lip glosses I love I loved loved
to their buttercream lipsticks that are
now I believe discontinued I really like
their new of mousse Bush lipstick
formulation and also the luminous
lipsticks are nice as well I also have
quite a few of the dual ended lipsticks
in there as well and then of course like
I said I have the 2014 holiday kids and
the 2015 so I think that this is a great
great brand and this is probably one of
the best holiday kits that you will find
price-wise and value wise it's just
really really worth it if you are
someone who likes a very comfortable lip
products so let me show you guys what
the inner packaging looks like or what
the actual lipsticks look like this is
what they look like and they are very
comparable to a full-size of moosh boost
lipstick on March 1st
I'm Musa Boosh lipstick so here is a
full-size here is the deluxe eyes as you
guys can see and believe you get
probably about half the product I'll
leave a comment down below and let you
guys know if I do the math and let you
know what the exact size is but the
first shade we have here is nori this is
that nice kind of darker cognac reddish
brownish shade I'm sorry about those
swatches you guys know how I am but it's
a beautiful beautiful color and the a
mousse boost formulation is very
moisturizing very very buttery and very
easy to wear on the lips personally as
they flutist I am like a sucker when it
comes to a comfortable lip product they
won't wear off on my flute headjoint so
that's very very important to me the
next shade we have here is called pepper
and pepper is one that I do have in the
dual ended lipstick formula and this is
the shade pepper right there so it's a
beautiful like rosy kind of Mabi color I
really really adore this shade it's a
very your lips but better kind of color
the next one that we have in here is
called I believe this one is honeycomb
and this one is my absolute favorite you
guys this is beautiful I want this in a
full size here is the honeycomb shade it
is a true nude however it's got a little
bit of like a peachy undertone and I
think it looks absolutely stunning on
the lips it is what I have on today I
really really adore this particular
shade and then the last one that we get
in here is the shade called fig and I
really like fig I think fig is a
gorgeous gorgeous color it's got a
little more of a pinky undertone than
this one and that is fig right there I
also have fake in one of the dual ended
lipstick formulation so I would say
overall if you are a sucker for bite
Beauty and you do like these kind of
neutral colors they are
this is not like new to fight beauty as
you guys can see they do do release the
same sort of shades every single year
but if you are a sucker for the
amuse-bouche lipstick formula or just by
beauty in general you definitely should
pick this up for $25 like no question
about it my biggest complaint is that
with these little deluxe sized lipsticks
I do feel like they are very fragile um
as you guys can see I just I don't know
I feel like they're just put in there
kind of loosely and I'm scared that if I
press too hard they will break on my
lips I'm not exactly the most delicate
person when I put my makeup on so that's
my biggest complaint about these but
overall the formulation is absolutely
beautiful the a mousse Bush lipstick
line is extremely extremely moisturizing
not as amazing as that butter cream
lipstick formulation was but still very
moisturizing I do like that they have
this nice little tip so that you really
can get into all of the little crevices
on your lips and I just think that they
are incredibly long wearing and
moisturizing so if you are someone who
does wear like a lip primer or a lip
balm underneath your lipstick you almost
don't need to do that with these that is
how hydrating and moisturizing these are
that is something that I consistently
see you through by beauty products
throughout their whole entire line even
their like lip glosses are extremely
extremely moisturizing so I think that
the wear time is pretty darn strong on
these idea to go ahead and pair this
particular honeycomb shade today with a
lip primer from Too Faced I have had it
on for I believe 12 hours now 12 hours
I have not reapplied do you guys see
that that is absolutely amazing I don't
think I've ever come across something
like that that is so long wearing
you would think because these are so
moisturizing that they would not stay on
as long however this baby stayed on long
so I really do like the formulation
don't be scared if you are someone who
is afraid of feathering or if you're
someone who doesn't like a really
moisturizing products because these do
still stay on the lips quite well but I
would recommend going in with a lip
liner ahead of time to make sure that
you don't have any sort of feathering so
I really think the formulation is
beautiful if you could pick this kit up
I would definitely go ahead and do so I
think it would be a great little holiday
kit to give to someone and also to use
as a stocking stuffer if you're someone
who celebrates Christmas so anyway here
are the swatches like I said this is the
shade nore
then we have honeycomb and then this one
right here why am I forgetting your name
this one is called
oh my god what's wrong with me that's
pepper
yes this one is pepper and then this one
is big so I would say it my two
favorites in the kit are definitely
pepper and honeycomb I think what I'm
really missing in this year's kit is a
nice read I love when by beauty does a
nice read because they do a great read
with like a beautiful blue undertone
last year's kit had a really gorgeous
read and then the year before as well
had a really gorgeous read so here are
the comparisons as you guys can see I
would say there are definitely some
similar shades going on here
Noorie is probably the one that stands
out this year I don't think they've ever
done anything quite as dark as this
pomegranate from last year's kit might
be kind of similar and also appreciate
it might be kind of similar but for the
most part this one has more of a deep
kind of brown undertone whereas
aubergine from last year has more of a
purple undertone I will say that fig and
also pepper are very similar to these
two shades from last year as you guys
can see so if you're someone who's just
looking for similar shades or if you're
someone who doesn't want similar shades
in your collection then yes I think that
last year's set is very very similar now
the 2014 set isn't exactly super super
similar but there are I would say one or
two shades there that definitely could
look the same on the lips if you know
what I'm saying so if you are someone
who just doesn't want something quite as
I don't know like repetitive as last
year's kit or the years before then I
would say don't go ahead and get this
but if you're someone who loves the
formulation you want a different sort
you want to try out the amuse-bouche
formulation which is their newest newest
one to hit the market then I would say
yeah it is worth it so anyway those are
my review and swatches I don't have too
much to say this is a kit that I
purchased every single year and then I
highly recommend to everyone I think
it's beautiful I love the formulation I
will say if you guys are curious which
one has been my favorite set it has
definitely been last year's I really
like to be retractable lip pencils I
feel like these were not messy at all
they were it very easy to use and I
wasn't worried about them breaking this
year's set I'm a little worried about
these kind of breaking and then last
year's or not last year's the year
before a set I feel like these were very
messy as you guys can see so overall I
would say still my favorite set was last
year's set but this is still a very good
one to go ahead and pick up this year so
anyway I hope you enjoyed this review
swatches and comparisons on
new bytes via be the perfect bite set
