review this is going to be a review and
I also going to do swatches on my arm
for you guys I want to do them with you
guys so you could see exactly what kind
of color payoff you're getting with this
product because I think that's probably
the number one most asked question
because this is a lipgloss set this is
the bite Beauty water color lip gloss
library that they literally just
released on they support calm website
right now it is only for VIP and VIP
bruges it's like an exclusive but it
will be free to purchase for everybody
not free I wish it was free but free to
purchase everybody will be able to
purchase the product and I think it's on
April 13 so that's in like three days
um but right now it isn't exclusive for
VIP and VIP Rouge members um I like that
and I do recommend going VIP room if you
can because not trying to promote having
a makeup addiction because I think
anybody that has the ID Rouge status
that Sephora probably has a makeup
addiction but you get so many benefits
you get three day free shipping and you
get your hands on these products before
other people and before they you know
are completely sold out so highly
recommend anyway not sponsored by
Sephora by any means I promise does that
I throw that out there but anyway so
this is the water color lip gloss
library I love the packaging absolutely
beautiful I'm going to keep the glasses
in this packaging because I love it that
much this goes for $49 on the Sephora
website and it is a $165 value looking
over to the page to double check but in
here you get 12 limited edition yest
limited edition which means you won't be
able to get these again probably shades
so these are all lip glosses when I saw
it on the website I thought what what no
lip gloss what I'm so confused
I thought either it was going to be
completely sheer and like clear or super
super pigmented and people actually wear
stuff like yellow lipstick or I mean
yellow lip gloss not my thing I don't
think I do it but they're not that crazy
crazy pigmented you have to remember
guys these are
these are not lipsticks by beauty is
known for having super high like
pigmentation in their products including
their lip glosses but these are not that
crazy crazy thick sticky kind of texture
that you get with other brands it's
really like a nice wash of color over
the lips I am wearing this color here
right now this is the darkest one in the
kit and it is called 12 or 12 or there's
a stamp right over the name I really
don't like that but I want to say I
think it says 12-hour but I feel like 12
would be more accurate it's a word but
um 12 or 12 or this is the color I'm
wearing right now it I'm just wearing
one layer of it it's super super high
high glossy Sheen pigmented my only
complaint with some of the darker colors
in this kit is that they don't always
apply super evenly on the lips like I
said because these are glosses you know
a lot of people are looking at this kit
and thinking like oh they're gonna be
super super super heavy like heavily
pigmented but I think by beauty's
concept of this was water color like you
know springtime kind of look like sheer
color on the lips and I think that for
the kind of look that they're going for
I think this works really really well
and I think it is worth the money so
these are not as pigmented as say I
don't know like you know the wet wild
what are those but and while her glosses
are the ones from Smashbox things like
that but I think the concept is that
they're not supposed to be I think we
all know that bite Beauty has very
pigmented products and if they wanted to
make these super super richly pigmented
they could but I think the thought that
it's spring and you know you probably
wouldn't wear necessarily all these kind
of deep deep colors during like the
springtime if they were heavily heavily
pigmented these are more like fall kind
of colors and over here it's like if it
was super pigmented and showed up yellow
on the lips a lot of people would even
want to get this kit because of that but
I think it sparks a lot of interest I
think the color like variety and the
range is beautiful and it's beautiful to
look at are these
um so I'm going to do like live swatches
with you guys so you guys can see
exactly what the pigmentation is like
I'm telling you right now it is not as
pigmented as you probably think and that
can be a good thing and that can also be
a bad thing I personally think it's a
good thing I understand what they were
going for they're going for a light wash
of color for spring and like I said I'm
wearing that deepest deepest color right
now that really would be rich purple and
you can see it's not showing up like BAM
you know it's like nice and subtle and
it's kind of blending in with the purple
in my dress
so um when I first got them the first
thing i swatched were the lighter colors
I'm gonna swatch them right now for you
guys to see you guys can see what I'm
talking about we're gonna start with
this yellow color and it is called see
and eat one oh my god you guys look at
that they put a stamp right over the
name see any I was like to tell you guys
see a neat no it says one this is one
okay nice two yellow color um they have
these nice little applicators typical
applicator from bite Beauty it's kind of
curved at the top and mostly flat but
it's not completely it's like a little
taper towards the top of you guys can
see but these do have the same I would
say feeling on the lips of their other
what are those like super fruity lip
glosses that they have I think this
might be the same formula however I find
the ones that I got during the winter
time they came out with like a little
trio that had lip glosses that I believe
are like a main thing in their
collection and those weren't much more
pigmented than these but they feel the
same they don't feel sticky they feel
nice and creamy and they don't like
bother me anyway let's watch one so
there it is that's just one little swipe
I'll go ahead and build it up a little
more I didn't want to well of course as
I do that it's gonna start to share out
because I'm not just doing the straight
up line but as you can see this
basically just blends into my skin tone
this is kind of like having a clear
gloss on your lips okay so disappointed
in this one maybe a little bit but I
think I'd be more disappointed if it was
bright yellow and it showed up bright
yellow my lip
the next one is this lilac color it is
called for await oh my god I feel so
stupid you guys these are all in
numerical order 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 12 10
11 12 so when I told you this one said
it looked like it was 12 or 12 they put
stamps oh right over at the top where
the actual name is and that drives me
crazy but beauty always does I don't
like that anyway this is 3c they're out
of order guys I'm sorry I'm not prepared
but it's because I've used all of these
maybe not realize I'm just so stupid
número order number 2 this nice light
pink color and I understand why they did
the numeral order thing because it makes
sense because these are limited edition
they don't need to give them names so
that's with like the little line
obviously it's a lot more pigmented and
then you share out and it does give you
a nice little pink like pink almost kind
of cool tone very very pretty neck all
right number three
I'm so embarrassed by that new Michael
Werner of course is this color it's like
a nice dusty light purple which is a
very in right now it's a very in kind of
color right there sheer out because
obviously they're not just gonna have a
line on your lips there's that color
also very pretty kind of like a my lips
the better sort of color or at least
from my lip color I do want to add that
these are not like full-sized by any
means these are I would say deluxe like
deluxe size but you don't like the
glosses don't well I guess some people
probably go through lip glosses pretty
quickly I don't but alright I did three
right okay here's four this one is the
nice lilac that I showed you earlier
than I thought said it like weird name
there's one and then you want to blend
it out because it won't look that heavy
that's why I don't like when people do
like I think I saw someone do a video
and they just went like a line line line
line line and I was like but you're not
just gonna put a line on your lips you
know you you really want to spread it
out because lip glosses spread they have
to spread over the lip so that is for
very pretty very much like watercolor
watercolor me I like that one a lot
number five
mint green skerin don't meet me here is
five again I think they're smart and I
think they realized that people would
not wear a completely opaque yellow or
mint on their lips so the yellow one
number one and number five which are
kind of the colors that stick out are
sheer number six is this mace I remember
this one this one's nice it's like a
warm neutral medium tone pink I'd say
sticky there's this wipe out gain a
little more pigmented because you're
getting a little darker so nice kind of
medium tone pink look at that shine on
all of them love it
alright that was six time for seven at
least now I know to put them in order in
the box okay number seven is this nice
like rhubarb II kind of color
rhubarb II my lady it looks like kind of
like my dress color
okay pigmented but you got to kind of
blend it out wow that was a it swatch
girl there we go getting a little more
heavily pigmented I can see like the
water color kind of look light too
darker right next
we've got number eight which is like a
burnt Coralie kind of orange a little
deeper than a coral I'd say starts
watching over here take my Fitbit off
I'm gonna be a sticky mess all right
blend that out okay very nice
still got some nice pigmentation there
and like I mentioned the deeper I got
like the more I played with the deeper
colors when I swiped them on I find that
a lot of it kind of applies to the top
lip instead of the bottom for some
reason maybe that's just me maybe it's
just my lips but um it seemed like as I
got with the darker colors not the
lighter ones but the darker ones it put
too much on at once if that makes sense
like the applicator was thinking up too
much at once and then it got a little
before I went you know it wouldn't look
even so you really want to with the
darker colors after you apply them
really get you know do a good lip
whatever you call that lip rapid motion
number nine of you undermined already
seven eight guys number nine a nice um I
would say neutrally kind of purple not
as dark as the other one number twelve
not number what did I say it was
seriously that's embarrassing
number 12 or X well I don't edit my
video so this is it that's what it is
you possibly you're in Twelver no but
this is number nine not as deep as
number twelve but still very pretty
swatch it over here there's the one line
and then of course you blend it out
because that's how you do on the lips
feel like my arms are getting very
abstract nice kind of like the Rue
Barbie color over there rhubarb rhubarb
color over there but just a little tad
deeper and I feel like these are
somewhat true to the color in the tube
of course this is like sealed with the
product so it looks very very pigmented
and heavily you know because it's soaked
in the product so it's gonna look a
little lighter on so alright we are at
number eleven which is this nice dark
pink color
this is very pigmented maybe nice so got
that nice shine I feel like the pastel
ones really pick up that really nice
shine because they're not as opaque but
um pretty water color starting to look
like a little abstract watercolor
painting I think that's actually what
they were going for I love it
awesome it's great and number ten wait
that's not possible
because I did 11 okay ten eleven I just
did eleven I'm sorry guys these were out
of order this just proves to you that
I've been using them and wearing them
because I threw them back in the box
just for this video so you guys could
see how they came packaged but this is
number ten should have gone ahead of the
other one this is more of a like hot
pink but like a neutral a lot more like
neon II kind of lighter pink than that
one but not like creamy like you know
whitish kind of undertone like this one
over here someone's definitely more like
creamy this one is the what number is
this - this one's definitely a little
more richly colored and finally number
12 the one I'm wearing today I'm just
going to put some of my lips right now
so you guys can see what I'm talking
about when I say do you see like when I
did it right away it kind of it kind of
piles up on the top of my lip up here
and then I kind of had to brush it
around to evenly coat my lips if that
makes sense but that's just kind of like
a lip gloss issue in general especially
if you're getting something that's a
little more pigmented not that these are
super heavily pigmented like I said but
they are more pigmented than like you
know one of these that you could just
throw on and it's like oh yeah
it's fine with one coat I don't even
need to look in the mirror with this one
I'm like oh is it evenly spread all
right so let's swatch this one
and definitely comes out later on of
course my skin than my lips because your
lips already have pigment to them so
it's gonna look well most yeah most
things are gonna look just darker than
they do on of course my skin my super
super pale skin but I'm here are the
swatches what do you guys think worth it
worth it for the $49 I think they are
I'm gonna talk a little more hi Lily
McKinney wants to join she's so excited
I'm gonna talk a little more about the
formula like I said I think these are
the my goodness what are those lip
glosses that they have I think they have
like a super fruit lip gloss or
something I have a few of those I think
these are very very similar to that
formula
I know these are limited edition shades
but they have that same taste kind of
like a sweet berry sugary kind of taste
which is really really lovely and they
feel like butter on your lips these this
is not a product that is going to dry
out your lips I've actually found that
by beauty products in general whether it
be their lipsticks or hello there I've
got a lip bath that stuff just hydrates
and even these glosses like if you have
any dry areas on your lips it's not
going to accentuate that area it's just
it's all good so um like I said I really
like that it feels so smooth like it
feels like I have like really really
nice like honey on my lips but not
sticky does that make sense like I can
feel that it's there it's not like I
don't feel it on my lips I can feel that
it's there but it's not something where
I'm like trying to like get my hair away
cuz it gets stuck on that like my hair
actually doesn't get stuck on this lift
last formula which is great but um it's
just so nice on the lips you have to try
it out to know what I'm talking about so
I highly recommend going in either
trying this out or just getting one of
their lip glosses or something because
it's a really interesting formula and
like I said it has kind of a sweet taste
not like the agave lip mask which has
that kind of
sugary taste but it's more like very
sweet kind of taste they don't have a
very strong smell they smell a little
bit like berries and they do come off a
little bit when you do kissing sure my
boyfriend won't like that but they do it
once like they're not sticky on your
lips but then when you yeah I'm really
trying to think now I guess when you do
have it on the skin it feels sticky but
it doesn't on your lips not quite sure
how that makes sense but it does feel
kind of like tacky on the skin but oh my
lips I don't feel that so I don't know
some kind of black magic going on there
I'm not quite sure but it's it's very
comfortable on the lips I'm a flute
player I constantly am playing flute and
you know just I'm obsessed with my lips
obsessed with taking care of them and I
can't wear certain products while I play
I can actually practice with these on
which is like that's awesome so there
they are the swatches wow this is a long
video but I really just kind of wanted
to talk about it I think there's gonna
be a lot of questions about this a lot
of people are just gonna want to know
and I just can't tell you guys how
stupid I feel even on the back of the
box
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 you know when
I got this I was so excited I mean look
at boo boom threw my on my lips at once
not even kidding just I just watched all
them on my lips oh I was thinking about
doing that for this video too but since
I don't edit my videos I would have to
like take a baby would I again for all
12 shades and then this would be like an
hour long so this I thought would be
good enough so you guys can see I would
say the pigmentation is like a decent
coverage I don't think it applies
completely evenly on the lips when you
get into the darker shades the lighter
shades it doesn't matter because they
are not as opaque and they're a little
more sheer but I love the fact I love
the car
except I left a box watercolor spring
love it
I'm interviewed for you guys a few
things on the support website quickly
like I said by beauty water color lip
gloss library $49 $165 value what it is
a limited edition set with an array of
12 lip gloss shades that are inspired by
watercolors ethereal beauty rich in
antioxidants nutrients from extracts and
seed oils each sheer gloss provides
hydrating properties that will keep your
lips ultra soft rich in antioxidants
nutrients fruit extracts and seed oil
these watercolor inspired glasses come
in a palette of high shine shades and
they're free of parabens sulfates and
fat alights failings however you want to
say it says what you need to know we
were so inspired by this color palette
beautiful and effortless shades that are
also a little irregular and
unpredictable a gorgeous wash of color
that offers a subtle yet striking lifted
color for lips Susanna Gurr fight Beauty
founder and CF CEO so I think she really
was going for the yes you can wear the
darker shades and get more of a full
pigment on the lips but like the lighter
shades like the ones that are a little
like unpredictable like the mint and the
yellow she's smart for not making these
completely completely pigmented yes that
would have been really fun but at the
same time not a lot of people who wear
that so she made them nice and sheer and
I like that on the website they describe
them as being sheer I won't say that
they're all sheer but it's kind of like
they're saving their butts by saying
their share so they don't get complaints
by saying like oh they weren't super
pigmented I think that's the number one
question people ask about this so
everybody wants to see swatches
everybody wants to see if they're super
pigmented what's the dealio are these
like the next line prime kind of thing
with the yellow and the mint no these
are just nice watercolor inspired
beautiful limited-edition lip glosses so
I hope you guys enjoyed this review and
swatches of the bite Beauty water color
lip gloss library I'll see you guys in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
