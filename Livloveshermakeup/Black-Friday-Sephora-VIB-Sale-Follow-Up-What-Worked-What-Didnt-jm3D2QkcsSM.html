my channel today I am sharing with you
guys a haul follow up for my past two
halls so my black friday haul as well as
my sephora vib sale haul I'm glad I
waited a little more time in between
these two because honestly there are
still a couple of products I haven't
even tried out yet and I feel like if
there's more than three or four products
then obviously I need a couple more
weeks but I did want to let you guys
know I still have not tested out the
chart artist Pro lashes yet I don't wear
lashes very often unless I'm going to be
on stage so I haven't tested those up
yet and I have not tested out and the
body shops body butter trio I have
purchased these in full size before so I
know that they're good body butters I
just wanted to let you guys know there
are two products that I have not jumped
into yet there have been a lot of
products I've been purchasing the past
couple of weeks so it's really hard to
get to everything but anyway without
further due a further one do but we're
gonna go ahead and talk about the best
and the worst as far as these halls were
concerned so I want to start with my
favorite favorite products the first one
is definitely the pharmacy green clean
makeup melt away cleansing balm I am
loving those so many of you are
recommending I picked this up and I'm so
happy that I did it reminds me a lot of
the OSHA makeup breakup coal cleansing
oil but in a solid form it's very air
light I mean seriously the container
feels like it could be empty I love the
smell the smell is kind of lemony and a
little bit of like that echinacea
kind of scented that pharmacy is known
for it but it's very very nice and
around the eyes it doesn't sting at all
so this is like my new favorite makeup
remover I am very very partial to the
Burt's Bees cleansing oil but this is my
new face so thank you so much to
everybody who recommended I picked that
up and then also you guys I have been so
impressed with you to the people set
that I picked up right now I only have
the microalgae amassed to share with you
guys because I have my boyfriend hooked
on the moisturizer and I actually gave
my mom the small little cleansing gel
and the reason for that is because this
came in a little trio and I actually
went ahead and purchased a full-size of
the micro algae bath a full size of the
cleanser already as well as the
moisturizer and those are on their way
to me currently you guys I am so
incredibly impressed with this brand if
you micro algae mask is really really
nice these are all made handmade in
California a beautiful vegan
cruelty-free skincare products if you're
looking for something very basic that
doesn't have like AJ is or benzoyl
peroxide
like acid and all that kind of stuff in
it the cleanser is great the moisturizer
is great and this is really really great
I like that this doesn't dry down too
much on the skin so it doesn't feel
super super tight like a glam glow mask
but you can rinse it off and it just
really makes your pores feel very very
refreshed and I love the scent of it I
really really come to love the scent of
these products they definitely smell
kind of like a green smoothie but I
don't know and the more I use them the
more I like them as far as the cleansing
gel is concerned it pairs beautifully
with like a luna Pharrell mini or even
some sort of a cleansing gel a really
really nice product I like that it
doesn't strip my skin I like that I can
use it around my eye area without any
sort of irritation so it's great for a
double cleanse and then finally at the
beautiful beautiful hyaluronic acid
cream it is gorgeous you guys great
consistency very buoyant I feel like it
would work for all sorts of different
skin types so yes those are the two
little products I would hands down
recommend from this haul there's
anything that I would recommend you put
on your loves list or pick up from so
far it is those two skin care products
now let's go ahead and get into some lip
products that I definitely really really
enjoy but like I said these were the two
holy grails
I'm from the whole entire haul but I
really do love these Marc Jacobs a
little glosses right here so many of you
have been saying I should pick up the
snake charmer scent I did pick up the
five piece set I believe currently it is
on sale only sephora.com website and you
know what these are really really good
glosses this shape right here is called
let's see here boys don't cry it's a
beautiful purple and this one is one of
my favorites it's called raspberry beret
it actually looks a very very pink on my
lips so I really like this one and then
both of these actually surprisingly look
really really good and this is nude
right here which is called sugar sugar
does have tiny little gold reflex in it
but it looks great like a natural light
I don't know what it is but it just
looks really really nice if you want to
pair it together with like a lipstick
that isn't really your color and you
want to darken it up a little bit you
can use this it's kind of funny because
it looks very very light in the two but
actually swatches out a little deeper so
I've even enjoying that and then I
absolutely love skin deep this is a
great your lips but better kind of color
at least for me personally as well as
changes this is a gorgeous kind of high
shine holographic gloss I love it on the
lips every time I wear this people are
like what do you have on your lips it
has a little bit of like a purple and
blue reflect to it so I really do enjoy
that little 5p
that I purchased from Marc Jacobs I'm
also enjoying the little Turk reinforce
of the C liquid lipsticks not liquid
lipsticks ah what did these cult bring
for us with the C lipsticks so I got a
little set this first shade is called
marks which is a beautiful your lips a
better kind of color it looks beautiful
pair together with skin deep if you guys
are curious I have been wearing these a
lot paired together with the Marc Jacobs
glosses this next one that we have here
is called sandals I don't know what it
is but this color it doesn't look that
great on me I think because it has a
little more brown and burgundy in it
than like a true red I love a true red
on my skintone but I'm not loving this
color I mean it looks pretty but it's
not like my perfect red if that makes
sense and then here we have soaked
soaked has quickly become my favorite
shade it's like a deep berry with a
little bit of neutral undertones in
there again it looks absolutely
beautiful paired together with skin deep
from a Marc Jacobs or even a raspberry
beret the two of these look really nice
together and then I also do enjoy this
last shade which is call let's see here
jet set and jet set is kind of like this
deep deep deep I would say plummy black
berry shade and it looks very very nice
on the lips these are very moisturizing
they stay on a nice amount of time so
yeah really enjoying that lipstick
formula right there I personally still
prefer like my bite beady eye moves
bousche lipsticks that I wanted to go
ahead and talk about those alright guys
let's talk about a foundation right here
that I have been so obsessed with I'm so
happy I picked this up it is the
Smashbox Studios skin 15 hour we're
hydrating foundation I picked up the
shade 1.1 which is a little too dark for
me unless I'm wearing two layers of
self-tanner like today when I have one
layer self-tanner on this is just a
little too dark but I have to say if it
is everything this is a great foundation
if you have normal or dry skin a lot of
you are telling me that you love this
because it has a really long wear time
and I was kind of like if it's a
hydrating foundation how can I have a
long wear time but it really does this
wears a good 10 hours on my skin I can
wear it to work it looks great it has a
beautiful finish to it you guys and
originally I wanted to do like a first
impressions on this particular
foundation but I couldn't wait I cracked
right into it and I'm so happy that I
did so what I want to do is either mix
this together with like a white mix here
to kind of lighten it up so that I can
wear right now I want to only have one
layer of self-tanner on or
stop on two layers of self-tan or even I
can pick up another shade and maybe mix
the two but yeah beautiful foundation if
you have normal to dry skin if you were
more oily I can't really see you liking
this it's possible you would but you
definitely have to set it in with a
powder but I love the finish of this
it's natural it's glowy it's beautiful
and it really does wear an incredibly
long amount of time for a hydrating
foundation so super happy with that
Smashbox foundation all right moving on
via the it cosmetics miracle water this
is an anti-aging three-in-one glow tonic
skin to brighten ingredients a booster
anti-aging treatment essence and skin
softening micellar cleanser I only use
it as a micellar cleanser in the morning
I don't love it around my eye area it
actually stings a little bit now most
micellar waters do sting on my eye area
except for these simple ones so I can't
complain too much about that but this is
a beautiful I really like this I want a
full-size of this I think it is a really
nice product
I wouldn't necessarily compare it to
like the glow tonic from pixie or
anything like that it doesn't have my
colleage acid in it but in the morning
if i wake up and i need to do something
quickly and i don't have time to wash my
face or i don't want to get you know my
sweater wet or something like that I
will just go ahead and I will take a
cotton pad and run this all over my face
like I said I'm a little sensitive to it
around my eye area but this is
definitely a hydrating as sort of
micellar water I've never come across a
micellar water that actually puts
hydration back into my skin I feel like
the simple one balances out my skin I've
tried a few they really take it like the
oil off my skin but this one actually
puts hydration in so this is definitely
a good at cleansing water it is quite
expensive I would definitely go and
check out the simple one first and see
if you like that
but I haven't thinking of going ahead
and purchasing a full-size of this now
as far as the treatment essence is
concerned I don't like it as an essence
I feel like it's a little too thin to be
an essence for me personally I prefer my
ELF hydrating essence or even my Dabo
hydrating essence so I would not
probably use this as an essence but I do
like it as a micellar water quick and
easy in the morning all right guys here
we have these so much brighter pumpkin
and coffee candle I've also started to
burn my other one and I really really
love this I have noticed with this one I
do have to trim the wicks in just a
little more but they burn it really
really evenly as you guys can see you
never get like a huge amount of wax pile
up on the side
it smells amazing this is pumpkin coffee
a smells great so yeah having a
good time with my so much brighter
candles and then here we have the glossy
a serum so I bought the super pure serum
I also bought these super bounce as well
as these super bright serum during the
cyber monday or was a Black Friday event
and I really loved the super pure this
is super lightweight super super a very
very lightweight it doesn't have any
sort of cells to like acid or benzoyl
peroxide in it I don't think it says
that it has anion cyanide and zinc in it
I don't know what that is I've
learned about this particular ingredient
when I was working at so foreign this
skincare section I can't sit but think
it's very good for your skin as well so
this is great if you are a little more
combo oily or if you have more
problematic skin I can even use it on
dry skin and it doesn't feel overly dry
the only thing I will say about this is
I don't feel like you get a lot of
product in these little serum bottles I
got all three of them for under I
believe $45 so that was definitely worth
it but yeah these are pretty small now
as far as super bounce is concerned my
goodness I definitely repurchases into
this repurchasing this for my dry
exhorting skin because this has
hyaluronic acid and b5 in it it goes on
beautifully it's not too a slimy feeling
it just sinks in immediately really
really like the story in the daytime and
then the brightening one I am not using
actually gave up to my boyfriend and he
said so far so good he just feels like
he's gonna go through it a little
quicker than other serums so let's move
on to some more products that I've
really been enjoying during the Black
Friday event I did pick up at the next
advent of lippy calendar it has 24
different lip products in here I have
really been enjoying at this set if you
guys are curious I do have only shade
root beer float on my lips today it is a
butter lipstick and honestly that's the
first time I've ever tried the NYX
butter lipsticks that is probably the
formula in here that I'm most impressed
with another formula that I'm very
impressed with are the NYX lip launch
arrays I've heard really bad things
about these a lot of people tell me
they're very drying and things like that
but I can't even feel them on my lips
honestly they remind me a lot of like
the color Papa blotted lips like you can
barely fear the feel them there you know
what I mean the color pop blotted lips
after a few hours definitely start to
get a little crackly these do not so I
love the NYX lip lingeries I also have
huffing at the intents of butter glosses
i love the regular butter glosses pretty
much every single formula in this set i
have been enjoying so let me swatch out
my favorite shades so
here is the butter lipstick initiate
root beer flow which is what I have on
my lips today this is a great your lips
but better kind of color again you
probably hear me say that a lot your
lips but better but those are my kind of
shades you know I don't go for anything
too out there I also have been loving
this little guy right here which is one
of the NYX of lip lingeries in the shade
what do you call push-up I was wearing
this one the other day and a lot of you
were asking what I had on my lips it's a
beautiful beautiful color kind of
reminds me a little bit of a honeycomb
for my beauty so I've really been
enjoying that one and then I also have
been enjoying this butter lipstick and
this one is totally not my kind of shade
but it's called seashell and it's a
really really pretty light pink color
now you may be thinking I can't see you
in that pink color but actually what
I've been doing is topping one of the
darker Marc Jacobs glosses on top and it
looks beautiful so but those are kind of
my favorite shades so far that I have
tested out I also have really been
enjoying it the Becca shimmering skin
perfecter press in the shade Prosecco
pop you guys know I love the Becca
shimmering skin Perfector press formula
so yes I have been joined this a lot I
do like to mix it together with more
bronze II kind of blushes and then put a
little bit on my cheeks work it into the
apples of my cheeks and it really makes
it look a lot more flattering because
this is like a true yellow kind of gold
color I don't have a golden undertone I
don't even have a warm undertone so to
mix this onto my cheeks I have to be
kind of careful but honestly I'm very
very happy with that I love my Becca
shimmering skin perfecter press I also
have been enjoying the it cosmetics
hello lashes mascara I was so nervous
that this is a mascara that I had tried
out before it was only the acog Matic
superhero that I had tested out so this
one actually has been doing really nice
things for my lashes I really like it
for lengths I don't feel like it's a
trifecta mascara so it doesn't have like
the volume length and thickness thing
going on you don't get a lot of volume
or thickness from this but you get a lot
of length and you know what it's great
on the lower lashes the one isn't too
crazy
if you guys can see it has a little ball
at the end but what I like about that is
that I can just run it on two of my
lower lashes like so and I have
absolutely no issues I haven't had any
issues with it flaking throughout the
day it has a really nice kind of wet
formula but it's not too wet to the
point where it like transfers up here so
oh we're all really good mascara very
happy up
that upper $10 here we have the Luna
sleeping at night oil another product
that I've been really loving now I
initially thought that the youth to the
people cleanser was actually breaking me
out but it turns out it was this little
guy I added this back into my routine
this past week you guys can see it used
about that much and yeah I forgot that
when you try out and when you start
testing out retinoids again you will get
some breakouts it's just something that
happens so you have to use this for
about a week or so to really get it
working on your skin I wouldn't
recommend trading off with this guy if
you're gonna start it like continue to
use it for a couple solid weeks to see
if you notice any difference but I do
love the Luna sleeping night oil from
Sunday Riley it is really good stuff and
it does help with texture and pores and
fine lines and wrinkles and things like
that so good product right here and now
I think we should talk a little bit
about the fails so the first one is the
amuse-bouche lipstick in the shade
cremini and now I told you guys I had a
feeling this wasn't gonna look good on
me a lot of lip products the past couple
of weeks but and this is what it looks
like okay it's got these really really
mustardy kind of brownish tones to it I
think what I need to do is what one of
you recommended you said it top it with
like a lip gloss that maybe has like
more purpley or pinky tones to it so I'm
gonna try doing it that way because I
want to make it work I love this
lipstick formula so I'm gonna try it
again but let me know if you have any
color combinations that you think would
work a little better with that maybe
like a light pink gloss would make it a
little more peachy I'm not quite sure
but this has kind of been a field just a
color fail I was nervous it wasn't gonna
work for me and it kind of isn't so let
me know if you have anything that I
could top on that guy and then I thought
I would also mention it there was I'm at
one particular formula from the NYX
advent calendar that I was not happy
with and these are the simply vamp as
well as simply a red lip creams these go
everywhere I have this shade on the
other day a lot of you were telling me
it looked amazing and it was a beautiful
color but I literally had to write in
the description box like I'm sorry and
my lips look like shed I don't know what
going on but I did test it out with a
lip liner and this just moves absolutely
everywhere and same with the red one so
if you are gonna test these out just
know they're a very very thin kind of
oily consistency kind of hard to work
with and then speaking of lip liner you
guys the Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on a lip
pencil and ozone I don't know if they
changed the formula of this but this
feels
friend and then my other lip liner that
I have from that is called ozone so it's
basically just a clear lip liner and
hasn't really been happen I have to be
completely honest with the lipsticks
I've been wearing this week so I'm gonna
have to look into that and see if they
changed up their formula going on here
and finally guys the last product that
definitely did not work was the secret
sauce moisturizer from it cosmetics I
really wanted this to work I mean I've
been talking about how excited I've been
when it comes to this this came with the
micellar water and a little pack it was
$15 for Black Friday on the Sephora calm
website but I hate the consistency of
this it's so strange and I feel like
there's a lot of claims when it comes to
this moisturizer and I only notice a
subtle difference is I know you need to
use a moisturizer for a while to notice
differences with fine lines and wrinkles
and pores and stuff like that but this
is just one of those things where it's
like instant hydration but it's slimy on
the skin it's I'm a consistency snob
okay when it comes to body washes and
moisturizers I just am and this does not
feel good on my skin it feels kind of
oily but also silicone like and I don't
I don't particularly like it so I was
happy that I got this little deluxe size
because I almost purchased the full size
of this but you know what it would have
not been worth it so anyway guys that is
pretty much it those are the products
that work for me and the products that
did not work for me for my past two
hauls I hope you enjoyed this video
thank you so much for joining me guys
and I'll see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
