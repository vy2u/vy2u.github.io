video is going to be a review and
swatches on the new Bobby to glow
shimmer brick palette from Bobby Brown
this is new it is limited edition and I
did purchase mine for $69 on the Sephora
calm website it is a 122 dollar value
and I will link down below in the
description bar where you guys can pick
it up if you are interested this is an
iconic and best-selling shimmer brick in
three shades that spotlight features and
flatter all different skin tones you do
get three 0.34 ounces of product in each
pan or nine point six three grams and
you are getting these shades gold wild
rose and bronze and they're supposed to
give your cheekbones a radiant all-over
glow they are formulated with super fine
light catching pearl pigments and each
shade in parts at brilliance with a hint
of color the gold shade brightens and
highlights the skin the bronze hue adds
warmth and Wild Rose creates a flushed
glow so anyway I was super excited to
get my hands on this I have never
actually experienced the Bobbi Brown
shimmer brick formulation in my life I
have never swatched them in store I
never wanted to pick up a full size I
thought that for $69 this was actually a
good deal considering the fact that a
full size Bobbi Brown a shimmer brick is
usually around 40 something dollars so
this is what the outer packaging looks
like super super pretty just a nice
glossy black a box it with like a glossy
gold finish on the front and it says
Bobby Brown Bobby to close shimmer brick
palette and then it does show you the
ingredients on the bottom here which is
quite nice the actual palette is kind of
the same way very very sleek and pretty
and shiny as you can see I have gotten
fingerprints all over it but it says
Bobby Brown in gold and then on the back
it shows you gold bronze and Wild Rose
which are the three different shades
that you are getting in here you open it
up you do have a nice sized mirror and
here are what these three shimmer bricks
look like they are extremely extremely
beautiful
I am absolutely adoring this kit you
guys today I have on the sheet gold
which is this one right here it's kind
of like a yellow bold shade I have that
on as my actual highlights but I have to
tell you I can use every single shade in
here I was very very surprised for some
reason when I first put my finger in
there I was like oh my god I hate it
you should wait until you apply
something to your face to decide if you
actually hate it but let me tell you
these are actually quite firmly pressed
and when you look at them they almost
look like they have glitter in them and
listen to this like they're almost
sandpaper when you're touching them and
I was like oh no no no I don't like that
but I continued to go ahead and apply it
to my face because my friend Jessica did
tell me that these are a little more
firmly pressed however she also said
that they go on beautifully and let me
tell you I am so incredibly impressed
with this formulation they may not feel
super soft and buttery to the touch but
let me tell you they are hella pigmented
and on top of that they go on like a
baked Jala formulation onto the skin and
you guys know my favorite kind of
highlights are those baked Chalet
formulations so I am incredibly
incredibly impressed with this
formulation now I know why everybody
talks about the shimmer brick
formulation I think it's because it's
absolutely outstanding so I like the way
that they put these three colors
together I do think it caters to every
single skin tone this shade right here
could be a highlight on really deep skin
tones and this works for me as a
highlight on my pretty fair skin tone
and then right here this pinky shade I
actually like to use it as a blush
topper but you can use it technically as
a highlight also if you do have medium
or light fair-skinned and I feel like it
would work for deeper skin as well I
really like the thought of these because
the concept is that they really can be
whatever the hell you want them to be
you could use this particular shade
right here which is like that rosy shade
you could use that as a blush topper you
could use this shade right here as like
an all-over bronzer and then you could
use this as a highlight you can use any
of these as an eyeshadow I feel like the
actual formulation on them is just so
impeccable and really really outstanding
to the point where they would work
anywhere on your face I have tried using
the bronze shade like on my lower lash
line to kind of smoke out my lower lash
line I'm not wearing it today I'm
wearing the Too Faced chocolate shock
palette but I have used like this little
color down here I guess you guys could
say like the last little strip here I
have used that to smoke out my lower
lash line
it went on beautifully I don't feel like
I had fallout I feel like these lasts a
very long time on the skin no matter
where you put them on the face and
overall this is just a really really I'm
gonna say it again impeccable
formulation I think it's absolutely
beautiful so don't judge a book by it's
cover by looking at it it may look like
it is kind of firmly pressed in there
and they are pretty firmly pressed in
they don't feel super soft and buttery
and creamy they are pretty
you know firmly pressed they don't pick
up any sort of product but I will say
these apply to the skin a million times
better than I thought they would so if
you are someone who really wants to pick
up a highlighting palette this holiday
season I would highly recommend checking
out this one I think they're gorgeous on
the skin they don't emphasize any sort
of fine lines or texture for me
personally I think they're great on the
eye area as well like I said they don't
have any sort of Fallout and I will say
that these lasts a very long time on the
skin I would say probably about 10 to 12
hours especially if you do use like a
primer but you guys absolutely beautiful
I am so impressed with this I've seen
tons and tons of different sort of dupes
for the Bobbi Brown shimmer bricks in
the past I do have those physician
formulas the little shimmer strips I
don't think they're nearly as good as
these are and also I have seen the ones
from makeup revolution I thought those
were really good but honestly these are
better these are the real deal
absolutely beautiful if you do like the
shimmer brick formulation you're going
to love these even though these are not
full-size you're still getting a lot in
here for $69 and if you have never tried
out to these shimmer brick formulation I
highly recommend going in store not just
digging your finger in there but swatch
them on the back of your hands because
the way that these apply to the skin and
even on your face is absolutely
beautiful so let's go ahead and start so
watching the first shade we are going to
swatch is the gold shade which is right
here and again I really like that
there's different little rows here so
you can actually dip your brush into
whichever strip you want to or you can
mix them all together when you mix them
all together this is the color that you
are coming up with it's a beautiful
beautiful yellow gold highlight and I
did already swatch this one for you guys
but you guys can see it applied
beautifully no skipping anything like
that it's not chunky it's very smooth
very creamy and it looks absolutely
stunning on the skin the next shade that
we have here is called bronze and this
is the bronze one when I mix it together
with that really really light shade and
the darker shade this is how it comes
out in this swatch very very beautiful
as well you could also use this as a
blush topper if you do have very very
fair skin I do plan on doing a video on
blush toppers for you guys let me know
if you would like to see that and the
lashley that we have here is the wild
rose shade I love the way this looks on
the skin really really beautiful again
my
personal favorite way to apply that is
as a blush topper as well so those are
just basically one finger swipe
swatches so that make sense these are
basically just one swipe of the finger
really really beautiful very very
pigmented I like the way that these look
on the skin I think they're beautiful I
really have nothing bad to say honestly
when was the last time I could say that
in a review I feel like I say that every
time I really like a product but
honestly I just I've adored this I adore
this palette so I would say if you are
looking for a good highlighter palette
for the 2016 season definitely check out
this one definitely I don't know if it
will be available for everyone I do know
that it's only currently available for
VIP ruch members but hopefully it will
open up to everyone and you will be able
to get your hands on this because it is
fabulous
alright guys that is it for this review
and swatches thank you so much for
joining me and I will see you in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
