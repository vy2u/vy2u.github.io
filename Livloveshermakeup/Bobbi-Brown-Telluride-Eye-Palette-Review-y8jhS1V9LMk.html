thank you so much for joining me I have
a review for you guys today it is on the
new Bobby Brown Telluride eye palette it
comes in a little box that looks like
this and the actual packaging of the
palette looks like this so very similar
to the box really nice and sleek small
tiny little palette this is supposed to
be like a day to night palette and it
ranges from having some Mac's to even
metallic shades in here you get a let's
see here one two three four five six
seven different shades in here and it
really is kind of reminiscent of like
the naked 1 palette in my opinion I
think it has a lot of those like make
any kind of shades if that makes them
you know you get those nice mattes
um right there you get a cool tone mat
and then a warm tone mat which makes for
really really great transition colors
and then you get some darker shades you
get some nice just like warm Browns some
cool Browns just really really pretty
shaped um so it definitely reminded me
of the naked 1 palette you guys know if
you watch my channel that I appreciated
the Naked palette so much so that I
ended up giving all of mine away I never
touched them I was never interested in
them hold on grabbing at issue here I
can wipe my fingers I was never really
interested in them at they just kind of
sat in my collection they were not great
I I just didn't like working with them
so I actually did end up getting all
three of mine away um so basically when
I saw this palette I was like oh you
know that looks very reminiscent of the
Naked palette and I do love the colors
in the Naked palette I just didn't like
how they worked on you know my lids I
didn't like the way they swatch die I
don't know I just do not like them but I
saw this and I thought you would have
those really really nice everyday sort
of colors very very kind of neutral
perfect perfect shades and I'm really
glad I picked this palette up actually
really really liked it there were a lot
of really bad reviews on the actual
Sephora website for this palette this is
my first Bobby Brown eye palette I've
heard not so great things about the
Bobby Brown eye palettes Bobby Brown
really excels when it comes to like face
products foundations eye creams face
creams things like that
and I think that a lot of people say
there's certain textures like to her
shadows they don't blend very well and
things like that I do want to let you
guys know that I am laying it on my eyes
today and I found that it actually
blended very very nicely it also comes
with this tiny little brush right here I
just want to mention because they did
use this little blending side you get
this little a kind of flat shader brush
which I did use to pop a darker shade
underneath my lash line with and then
you get this nice little blending brush
that is actually really really well oh
that works really really well I actually
did use it to blend out my crease shade
today and I'm going to tell you guys
which shades I've used today for this
particular look let's see here so
starting here at this shade right here
is called cream it is like a nice just
creamy matte shade I used that all over
my brow bone and then I used this one
right yeah blazing star which is a
sparkle eyeshadow this one right here
which is kind of interesting it doesn't
really swatch very nicely it doesn't
really go onto the eyes very nicely it
truly is a glitter shade and you know
what it really reminds me of in the Too
Faced chocolate bar palette is it I
think the semi-sweet chocolate bar
it has a shade called pink frosting
which like has a weird kind of gritty
glittery texture to it it doesn't really
come off very well however you can just
pop it in you know the inner corners of
your eyes and it looks kind of nice and
that is what I did with this blazing
star shade today that kind of sparkle
shade but again it doesn't release watch
very nicely it's kind of rough to the
texture and it just doesn't really blend
well so I highly recommend either
placing it on the lid or going into the
inner corner of the eye and I think a
lot of people in the reviews I was
reading we're really kind of
specifically talking about those glitter
shades that Bobbi Brown tends to put
into her eye palettes um every time I
look at the bobbi brown eye palette I'm
like oh my gosh those are so beautiful
she knows how to block the colors well
she knows
um you know they they just really really
put the shades together well they know
how to create a really nice palette but
overall a lot of people tend to complain
a little more so um I was a little iffy
about you know going and purchasing this
palette
because it is a $52 pallet that is one
of support website $52 for those seven
shades I mean you know it better be good
but anyway I really do think it's nice
I'm very happy with it let me continue
to tell you guys what I have on my eyes
so like I said I have that creamy shade
which is called cream then I have
blazing star on the inner corner of my
eye and a little bit on my eyelid as
well and then I went in for the
transition to this warmer matte shade
right there it's really really nice
these two shades I said this one and
this one are really really nice
transition colors one's a little more
pinky and one's a little more topi and
those ones are called antique rose and
wood rose and they are just really
really great for transition colors I
really really like these so I used
antique rose today and I just put that
right into my crease with a fluffy brush
and it really helped so that when I went
into the darker shades for my crease and
also my outer B everything blended
really nicely so then I went into this
shade right here which is called a
velvet plum it is a metallic and I did
that all over in my crease blended it
out and then I went in with this other
shade right here which is a little bit
of a cooler purple um and it is called
Heather rose and that is a shimmer wash
so all over really really nice textures
in my opinion again a lot of people
complain about the textures but I think
that her matte shadows are really
beautifully at texture and I think that
the shimmer wash are really nice and
metallics I'm the only one I don't
really like is the sparkle one and
that's because it has like chunks of
glitter and we all know that it is hard
to blend chunks of glitter anytime
you're going to use it it's better off
just you know kind of patting it onto
your eye like I said I used that chunky
glitter shade really really just kind of
tapped it on to my inner corner of my
eye and also on my eyelid so anyway like
I said all the shadows are cream
Woodrow's velvet plum blazing star had
the Rose antique rose and smoky Brown
I'm the only one I haven't really played
with that much is the dark color down
here called smoky Brown but it is also
in that and it is a very very pigmented
as you guys can see like almost black
Brown really really gorgeous I think
that that would make a really great
liner shade and I
definitely excited to play with it so
overall I'm really really happy with
this palette I know a lot of people are
like oh it's just it's too it's the
textures and you know $52 for these
shades it's not worth it but for me it
is worth it um like I said I'm not a fan
of the naked palettes and a lot of
people kept writing um in the review
section for this particular palette they
kept saying the naked one is so much
better you know and for like I think
what eight dollars more you can get the
Naked palette and get more shades and
more variety but I would rather have you
know textures and seven shades that I
would rather work with and having you
know like 15 like The Naked palette and
having stuff that just doesn't blend
very well and shades that I just I don't
know don't really compliment my eyes I
don't know I really don't know how to
explain my non fascination with The
Naked palette um I think that the colors
are really pretty but they just didn't
end up looking good on me so anyway this
is one of those kind of Nicki and Eve
palettes that really is working for me
and I'm very happy with it I'm gonna
read a little bit about the actual
product on visa for website for you guys
so it says the bobbi brown tell a ride I
palette $52 what it is an eye palette
with seven shades curated by Bobbi Brown
for a day and night look Bobbi Brown's
Telluride eye palette offers seven
complimentary shades um in that two
metallic finishes that allow you to mix
and match for endless super wearable
looks with flat pinks and warm roses to
rich Browns as limited edition palette
is inspired by the gorgeous shades of
sunset it features flattering I looks
for a day night a large mirror and a
dual ended I shadow slash eyeliner brush
for a flawless application these silky
powder shadows go on smoothly blend
easily and don't Priest flake or fade so
I do want to just touch up on that
because I almost forgot um I have been
you know working with this palette for
actually I would say a couple weeks now
it's probably been out for about three
weeks and I've had it for about two um
but I really think that they're nice
especially if you wear a primer they
really do wear very nicely on the eye I
don't get creasing I don't get um you
know smudging things like that so it's
just really really good formula that I'm
very happy with so I hope you guys
enjoyed this review of the Bobbi Brown
