thank you so much for joining me I am
going to be doing a review and swatches
for you guys in this video on the new
Bobbi Brown University lip palette says
BBU lip palette this is what the outer
box looks like it's really nice very
sleek black typical Bobbi Brown and the
actual packaging looks like this and it
says Bobbi Brown University lips and I
was really excited when I saw this on
the Sephora calm website there were not
a lot of reviews I tried looking up
YouTube
you know seeing if there were any
reviews on YouTube and online and I just
couldn't find swatches or anything
anywhere and I think what drew me into
it was originally when I saw what it
actually looks like on the website which
is this yes gorgeous look at that look
at those colors I thought oh my gosh
look at those those look absolutely
beautiful for fall the first thing I
thought was I wonder if those are like
full-on pigmented like lipstick colors
or are they like glosses you know
because I'm so skeptical of lip palette
am always thinking they're not gonna be
pigmented they're just gonna look really
really sheer and like lip glosses but
I'm happy to say that Bobbi Brown did
impress me with this they do not just
look like lip glosses they do have a
decent amount of color to them so um
this goes for sixty dollars on the
support comm website it's a little
pricey but I think that for fall these
are just absolutely gorgeous stunning
stunning shades you do get ten of her
original like Bobbi Brown lipstick
shades in here I don't know which ones
they exactly are because I actually
don't own any lipsticks from Bobbi Brown
and you also do get to a special like
shimmer shades in here which at first I
was like oh come on that's just like a
weak way of saying you get to like lip
glosses in here but actually I really
like them the two that are in here are
this one down here and then I would say
this one and they look very very sheer
and they literally barely even swatch
out but when you take a little bit of it
and you tap it on your lip you can
instantly see that it adds like some
luminosity and volume to the lip area
and I actually
I really like them so um let me read for
you guys a little bit what it says on
these sephora.com website it is a
Sephora exclusive and this is limited
edition so if you are interested in
getting it you should get it as soon as
possible so it says this is an exclusive
artist inspired palette with bobbi
brown's ten original lip colors
including two fan favorite shimmers and
it is a hand selected by Bobbi Brown to
offer a range of wearable super
flattering lipsticks that actually look
like lips these twelve nude bright and
bold shades can be worn alone or layer
to create virtually any lip look you
desire this sleek ready to travel
palette lets you carry all the
essentials on the go and it features a
large mirror for mistake-free touch-ups
with a creamy feel and semi matte finish
each lip color instantly delivers
comfortable rich color they're
formulated with vitamin E and C and also
beeswax that Li and that leaves your
lips moisturized for hours infused with
light reflecting pearls the shimmer
finished state shades leave the same
buttery feel and lasting long wear and
like I said they do kind of just like
plump up your lips they make it look
like they're bigger if you pat it on the
upper lip and the bottom lip like in the
center this palette includes an artist
developed tip card to help you get the
most out of every shade so that you can
take your look from everyday nudes to
subtle shimmer lips to a polished even
the evening look and that is nice to
have that little card in there they just
kind of tell you what colors you can mix
and match with what looks pretty
together and I just love the thought of
being able to mix and match with a lip
palette because you get to come up and
create your own sort of lip look and
especially because a lot of the shades
in here look very fall inspired I think
it's even better because it's like you
can create your own fall lip color and
ah it's awesome I really really like
that
so let's see here whether you choose the
original perfect nude beige the ultimate
fix for all lips or an ultra flattering
wearable anywhere a rose shade this
giftable palette is perfect for mixing
matching or playing up custom lip looks
you get 12 0.45 ounce lip colors in beak
shades salmon beige raisin brown rose
pink orange blackberry burnt red red
base gold berry shimmer and then you get
the tip card so a lot of information
there
like I said it is exclusive to Sephora
it is limited-edition so if you want to
get your hands on it you should get your
hands on it now I do want to let you
guys know on my lips today I am wearing
this shade down here and this one I
believe is burnt red so it is a mix of a
red and brown color together and you
guys can see these have really nice
pigment to them and how I applied it and
how I've been applying these particular
shades I tried just like putting it on
with my finger but it didn't feel very
exact and precise because it's not like
you have a lipstick where it has that
nice little like tip at the top and you
can kind of get into all the little
crevices you know it's different with a
lip palette you kind of do need to use a
brush the one I have been using I don't
have a lot of lip brushes so I've been
using my ELF
professional lip defining brush I
believe this is a dollar on the elf comm
website you can also just use you know
an eyeshadow brush whatever you want to
use that I highly recommend using a
brush and what I do is I just kind of go
into that color and I kind of coat both
sides and then I just apply it and I
kind of just sweep it on
and it really is quite pigmented as you
guys can see I really really like this
and uh like they said on the website it
is kind of like a demi mat semi matte
sort of finish it is very very
comfortable on the lips um before I put
the second layer on I have been wearing
that first layer for about three hours
so pretty good stain powder power I did
put my Urban Decay ozone eye light or
eyeliner or lip liner sorry
around like the rim of my lip so that it
wouldn't bleed out because I am wearing
a darker color today obviously but you
can also wear like a lip primer with it
if you want it to last a little longer
the Too Faced lip insurance one is very
nice one of my subscribers recommended
that for me and I picked it up and I
loved it but overall I think it's really
really beautiful I love the finish it's
very very soft on the lips it doesn't
feel overly dry they all have the same
sort of finish which i think is
beautiful and i just love the color I
love this color and I love the thought
of being able to go in here and mix and
match whatever color I want because I
think a lot of these would be beautiful
mixed together and this palette just
screams fall to me I just look at this
and I think oh my gosh like my lips but
better shades you get some reds you get
some pinks you get some rosy tones
absolutely absolutely gorgeous so I'm
gonna go ahead and swatch these guys for
you like I said I'm very impressed with
the same palette where I'm impressed
with the pigmentation it's not
completely opaque like I don't know a
bite Beauty lipstick it's not like you
just swipe your finger in and it's
completely opaque but it is a buildable
and as long as you use a lip brush with
it I think it is very buildable color
that will last on your lips so I am
quite happy with this um I really only
own two lip palettes including this one
I have one from Sephora that I
absolutely love it is the lip mixology
palette I believe that is on sale right
now if you go onto the Sephora comm
website and look under the sales section
that is a really really good one very
very pigmented colors in there but I
think this is a great addition to my
kids I love the fact that I can mix and
match and I think
these are the perfect colors for fall
it's going to be great to travel with as
well so let me go ahead and starts
watching these for you guys I am going
to start with the top row I'm going to
start with this shape right here and
this one is called oh it's like
upside-down this one is called salmon
and that is that kind of glassy shade so
it's one of those lips shimmer sort of
shades that's just gonna kind of make
your lips look bigger and better you
guys may be able to see it it's got a
little bit of a peachy tone to it the
next one is this one right here and it
is called beige and I believe this is
one of her best-selling lipsticks
actually beautiful kind of pinky nude
sort of shade I love that that one is
right underneath the next one is this
pretty color right here it's kind of
like a plum II your lips but better
shade and it is called raisin right
there very very pretty it's almost got a
little bit of like a rosy undertone I
like that a lot I think that's very
pretty right there and then you get this
shade right here which is kind of like a
Kylie Jenner ask sort of lip in my prop
in my opinion and it is called Brown and
that is the shade right there oh my god
I can't just do it I can't just wave my
pinky it's hard so that is the top row
very very pretty and again like I said I
feel like finger swatches just don't
really do it justice it's really the lip
brush that makes it built able and
workable and you can go from a sheer
layer to like a heavy heavy coverage on
your lips um but I just use that lip
brush and I don't really want to be
swatching over it because it already has
product on it so the next row we're
gonna start with this one it looks kind
of similar to that shade that I just
watched which was called brown but it's
just a hair deeper and that one is
called rose looks like that
and I kind of like that these colors
stay within the same sort of family they
don't really go into crazy crazy
different like purples and things like
that this is probably the brightest
color that you're going to find in the
palette and it is called pink but that
is really the only shade that goes like
pink everything else is very very
neutral you get a lot of Browns and reds
and it's very in those colors are very
in if you guys know what I mean alright
the next color is called orange it's
right there and then the last one we
have on this row is that deep color
right there and it is kind of like a
deep berry red shade and it is called
black berry so there are the hand
swatches that's off really really like
um the texture of these the way they
feel on the lips
they just feel very very comfortable and
like I said kind of like that demi matte
finish alright next we are doing the
bottom row and we're going to start with
the shade which I'm wearing today and
that one is called burnt red and like I
said this is the perfect mix of a red
and brown
there's burnt red next we are going to
go to this shade this one is a little
more of a true red and that one is just
called red she's very simple with her
names you can see there's almost no
difference between the two this one just
has a little more of like a blue
undertone burnt red and red then we have
that little shimmer color here which
really doesn't look like much but it
really does kind of plump up your lips
in a very pretty way and that one I
believe is just called shimmer beige
gold shimmer and then the last one is
called berry shimmer and this one has
tiny little flecks of pink glitter in it
so those all right there so overall I am
happy like I said it's not like these
swatch out like a bite Beauty lipstick
if that's what you're expecting you
might want to try the lip mixology
palette from Sephora those are a little
more pigmented but overall I think that
they're really beautiful they're very
buildable and comfortable on the lips
like I said you can use whatever lip
brush you want you can use the eyeshadow
brush whatever brush you want but I
highly do recommend using a brush I
think that when you do it with your
finger it just doesn't go on as evenly
and it's a little more sheer so
definitely built it up with a brush I
think the colors are just too perfect
for fall like she definitely definitely
had a fall mentality like I don't know
she was thinking of follow and she
created this lip palette because I look
at it and I'm just like that just says
fall to me so I am excited I think I
would be traveling for Thanksgiving so I
will probably bring this as my lip
colors because everything's in here it's
super compact and yeah I really do like
it I do think it is worth at these sixty
dollars um it just depends if you are
like someone who really only want very
very pigmented things or if you like
colors that can be worn sheer or light
or you know you you want like a mix of
darker colors with lighter colors
neutral colors I think that all of these
kind of have a neutral undertone they
all sort of look like my lips but better
shades it just depends on how much you
want to build it up with a brush so
I really really love it I am very happy
with this purchase and I hope you guys
enjoyed this review and swatches um
please give this video a thumbs up if
you enjoyed it and I'll see you in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
