morning I'm a little stuffed up a little
more than stuffed up I've been feeling
pretty sick the past couple of days but
I really wanted to film a get ready with
me video I thought today I would do kind
of an interesting look I thought I'd go
with a bold lip and bare face so I'm
really looking to just even out my
complexion do a little bit with the eyes
and then do a really nice bold lip I'm
planning on using the Maybelline Vivid's
collection this is 875 and vivid rose I
think this will be really really pretty
so I hope you guys enjoy this and let's
just get started so the first thing I am
going to do is even out my skin tone I'm
going to use the covergirl plus ol a CC
cream and I'm just going to take one
pump of that and apply that all over my
face
I think this is kind of an interesting
look it's kind of like the no makeup
makeup but with a pop so I'm excited to
do it thank you and I'm just gonna kind
of roughly just spread that all over my
face because I'm gonna be going in with
a foundation brush anyway um the next
thing I'm going to take is by L'Oreal
visible lift serum absolute foundation
this is in 1:45 classic ivory just gonna
take two pumps of that on the back of my
hand and get out my Real Techniques
expert face brush dab it in there and
start blending that into my skin
pretty bad acne scar is going to be
there from that painful I had there been
having some pretty hormonal acne lately
I have well I dunno why I mean it was my
time of month not so long ago but um I
just this time around was pretty like
extra bad so just gonna that's why I'm
using a CC cream and a foundation um the
CC cream is really nice it like
moisturizes nicely without leaving me
greasy and then the visible lift I
really liked the L'Oreal visible lift
line so using it and I'm just going to
take this it cosmetics Buki brush just
blend that into my hairline it really
have been enjoying this little set I got
from QVC the it cosmetic brushes are
just so like I feel so spoiled when I
use them they're so soft and so
wonderful so anyway also been having the
driest lips lately I've just been
feeling a little under the weather and
the dry lips have just been horrible
which really sucks cuz I'm a flute
player and I'm like no that's like the
one thing I don't want to be dry
literally I would rather have my face be
drivin my lips so after then I'm just
gonna tap in on the areas where makeup
tends to settle just so that you're
picking up extra on extra areas where
you don't want it to kind of settle it
and things like that
alright I'm going to take my ELF tone
correcting powder and cool you guys know
I love this oh this is a new one alright
alright so I am going to take my kabuki
um well my big big kabuki from where is
this from Ecotools just start patting
that and this is pretty normal
pretty normal kind of face routine here
and because we are doing like kind of a
semi natural look I'm not gonna go ahead
and cover those big suckers up because
the lips will draw the attention away
from it and yeah so gross though they
become all scabbing and disgusting
already which I really really don't like
not a fan but that's okay and then
adding this in not um swiping like I've
said before because when you kind of
swipe the product you're kind of moving
what's underneath it so I don't want to
do that I just want to really really set
that CC cream and foundation into place
right once I'm done with that so this is
what we have so far just really nice all
you know one color card base that's good
we even out the skin nicely laura geller
this is just the balance and brighten
foundation in porcelain it looks like
this I'm going to use this to highlight
it's a little too shimmery for me as a
foundation and a little too light so
take that just in the areas kind of
wanna what was that I was a piece of
fuzz uh kind of lighten up and it will
give some extra coverage which is nice
right well first let me pull you out my
brows I'm just gonna comb them out so
much crap in it and use my great lash
clear gel and just put my brows into
place so that they don't budge I love
this stuff this is great it doesn't
change the color of your eyebrows which
is really nice like that so set that
into place not gonna be filling them in
I really don't fill in my brows anymore
kind of gotten over that I used to but
then I got carried away
it's like constitutive I neither go one
way I'm sitting straight as I go one way
and I go too much or I go over the other
way they don't do that so anyway um do
my hair here like whatever so I'm just
going to grab one over here I'm going to
use my gosh this is from Duane Reade
this is the gosh cosmetics blush this is
in pink pie super super shimmery and
it's got some nice colors in there so
I'm just going to take my ELF small
stipple swirl it in there tap it off
then blow on it then snip
working on apples of my cheeks do the
same thing super it gets pretty powdery
that's why I'm blowing on it but also
you guys know that I have to blow off
any powder that gets like on anything
look is they're really nice to look glow
to the cheeks I like that give me some
color to my face I also like that a lot
so then I may go back in with my big boo
key and just blot say I always tend to
put too much on also this will help any
harsh lines okay next I'm going to curl
my eyelashes because even though we're
not really doing anything with the we're
not doing anything with the eyes we want
them to look still bright and open so
knees
how did you Thanksgiving you guys and
are you doing anything for Christmas let
me know below if you have Christmas
plans I'm going to be heading back with
my boyfriend to meet my parents in
Minnesota so that should be kind of fun
we're gonna leave on Christmas Eve yes
we have like a 1 o'clock flight in the
afternoon and that's because we're gonna
be spending some time with his parents
here in Manhattan before we go visit my
parents so anyway so there are the eyes
they got nicely brightened up I like
that next I am going to get started on
the lips so as you can see this is very
very quick easy I really didn't do
anything with the eyes didn't even put
white eyeliner on because you're not
really wearing anything they're like it
wasn't noticeable if you are white
eyeliner look one thing I do want to do
I did it the other day
all right well what you can do if you
want to if you really feel like your
eyes really just look super tired you
can put a little bit of like you know
like a beige eyeliner in there I don't
feel like mine are too bad today so I'm
just going to leave it as is I want to
look completely natural just the lips
are gonna look bold but you can also
take the Great Lash any clear like brow
product you can take this and one thing
you can do is hit your lashes and this
is just going to darken them up because
of the actual color but it's not going
to like appear that you have put mascara
on but it's just going to darken the
lashes up this especially how helps if
you are blonde like I am
I've been casually kind of lightening my
hair but I am naturally blonde so this
is quite helpful for us so that it looks
like we do actually have a little bit of
lashes so if you just want to do that it
will dry clear but it's nice because it
will darken up to the point where it
looks like you do actually have lashes
so I do like that for this eye look the
next thing I'm going to do is put on
eight I'm just going to take this one
right here this is Apple it's so cute
it's from Bath and Body Works
it smells like Apple to apply that OH
I'm going at the EOS lip balms accepting
the q-tip acting and I like these
because they have a little bit of hold
to them kind of like the EOS ones um
like almost like a little bit of a tacky
feeling which is nice when you're
wearing a long wearing lipstick so put
that on and then after that I am going
to go ahead and line my lips I am going
to be using the Milani color statement
lipliner to instant color in Oh 5 hoped
pink looks like this just gonna line me
up
bring it to the inside oh my qubits are
just so that we have kind of a boost for
our Maybelline 875 vivid Rose which is
very very vivid so I'm just going to
apply that now
and the reason I went with it usually
when you think like bold lip you
probably think of like red or something
but because we are keeping the eyes so
simple and barely doing anything to them
I think that a pink really like keeps
the appearance really useful and cute so
that's why I'm using this color
I love it I hunt that really is it guys
I thought it was nice because it is a
bear face but you have a bold lip so it
still is pretty and girly and I think
this is a really useful look especially
if you're looking to I guess take some
years off the face to I guess if you
want to um I think that heavy eye makeup
sometimes tends to make us look sexier
and a little more mature and if you're
looking for just an all-over really
useful look it's nice to just leave the
hair down do a really bold lip but in
like a really fresh color like pink or
like I'm not like a mandarin orange
color you could do that also with the
Vivid's they have this wonderful color
here I think it's actually cool mandarin
orange you could do it with really any
color on the lip I think the red really
would make a statement but today I'm
just trying to be cute and fresh and I
thought this was a nice look so this is
the look and I hope you guys enjoyed
this I'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
