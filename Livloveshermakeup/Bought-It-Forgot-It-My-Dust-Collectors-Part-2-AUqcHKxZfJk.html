my channel today's video is going to be
part two in my dust collectors series
this is a series all about products that
I bought and I for god I know it is very
unfortunate I do purchase a lot of
products I also do use up a lot of
products if you've ever checked out any
of my empties videos I mean I'm by no
means Lee you know a project pan or
anything like that but I do get through
with my collection and that's why I do
shop my stash videos all that kind of
stuff which by the way shot my stash
videos are coming back in March if you
guys are curious but yeah basically I
bought these products I forgot them
these videos are a nice way for me to
sit down and look at them again and
re-evaluate if I want to a declutter
them if they've gone bad or if I want to
go ahead and put them in a special place
that reminds me to use them so
let's go ahead and jump right into it
guys I want to start with some beautiful
beautiful blushes from ciate I got these
probably about six months ago and I feel
like I bought them I used them for about
two weeks and then I forgot about them
if these are those really really
gorgeous and baekchul a sort of blushes
I can't even remember what they're
called coz they're not even listed on
the back but I'm sure you have seen them
here on YouTube I believe they're called
like the illuminating blush or something
like that I know if the Tayla uses one
of these a lot users kind of like the
lighter peachy color this one right here
is called date night and then the other
one that I have is called a baby doll
which is a really really nice kind of
raspberry a pinky color you can see they
have swirls of color in here and they're
absolutely gorgeous and I have to say I
am tremendously disappointed with myself
for not reaching afford these more often
so this is definitely a product that I'm
going to go ahead and feature in a shop
my stash video to make sure that I get
some use out of it you really really can
build them up on this skin they glide on
like butter and have a mirror in them
which you guys know I am a fan of up
next we have the Urban Decay vice
lipstick palettes holy cow I used to
 love these you guys the first
one that we have here I believe is the
junkie palette no I'm sorry this is
actually the black male palette I can't
tell the difference until I open them up
the black male palette basically has a
bunch of neutral lip sticks in here some
of them are more like lip Stoppers some
of them are a cream formula some of them
are a little more matte they also have
their super mattes in here but basically
you get a bunch of different lipsticks
in one palette now you guys can see
unfortunately I shattered the mirror
here but
I love these pallets and I don't
understand why I have not been reaching
for them they are great for travel I
really like this one especially because
some of the shades in here like
warranted as well as 1993 even after
having these for over a year my
collection have remained so creamy and
so beautiful
and I feel like a lot of the times with
lipstick palettes unfortunately they do
dry out over time I have not noticed
that with these palettes right here and
then here we have the junkie palette
like I said they have a same exact
packaging so you can't tell until you
open them up you do have some
overlapping shades in here but not too
much what I love about this one is it
has a green lipstick if you guys saw my
video all about my favorite unusual
makeup products you know that I actually
am really drawn to very very colorful
lipsticks even though I don't wear them
all that often so I love this beautiful
green lipstick right here this one does
have more vampy colors in it and you
have a few more mattes in here and
overall I just feel like these are
really good quality and I love that they
have not dried out so definitely a
product that I bought and forgot and yes
they will be going in a shot my stash
video very soon because they are very
good quality and I need to get some more
use out of them up next we have a couple
of drugstore products the first one is
from Jake at beauty this is the
lovestruck blush in the shade 1:03 coral
dumpling and these are the blushes that
have the little cats imprinted on them
which is super cute I remember going
ahead and decluttering the shade pumpkin
because it was just a little too orange
for me I love orange blushes like mixes
cinnamon but those ones have kind of
deeper undertones and the coral dumpling
or orange dumpling or whatever the
it was called it was just called orange
something booked in whatever suits coral
dumpling that one was just way too
orange orange and it did not look good
on my complexion personally but you know
what guys these are such good quality
and the last time I checked I think
these were what 399 on the ulta.com
website super creamy super beautiful
they do have a little bit of an over
spray on them just a heads up however
they glide on like a butter they are a
little more sheer so if you do have a
fair or light complexion these are great
I believe they also do have some deeper
shades that you can check out if you do
have a deeper complexion you have to
build a little bit and they are a little
powdery but again this is going to go
into an upcoming shot my stash video
because I need to
it's a great blush and then
unfortunately I do have some lip oils
here from physicians a formula that have
gone bad I did not get to them on time
these are the Argan wear lip aisles we
have rose as well as gold and these were
kind of just like that typical lip oil
topper so if you had a really really
drying liquid lipstick on and you wanted
a little bit of shine a little bit of
moisture you could pop one of these on
they had a really really strong smell to
them and I tried using them the other
day they were chunky which is obviously
not normal for an oil and on top of that
the scent smelled like a rancid milk so
I know that these have gone bad I'm so
disappointed because this was like
$15.99 for the two of them and again it
just kind of shows you that you know you
have to be on top of your collection
make sure you're shopping your
collection make sure you're you know
going through your products or else they
will go bad so unfortunately these did
not really make the cut I bought them I
forgot about them they were really
really nice but I have to go ahead and
toss those after this video and finally
guys we have the Mallee ever color poor
face and defender I bought this I forgot
about it because they don't really know
how to use it I know so many of you have
told me use it as a primer of you other
people say you have to keep the sponge
that it comes with which I tossed away a
long time ago it's basically like this
jelly product right here that kind of
feels really smooth and almost matte
like and I know a lot of you were saying
that you can touch this up over makeup
throughout the day however it doesn't
work for me I bought it I forgot it and
I still don't like it
they didn't like it when I first tried
it out which is probably why I
disappeared out of my collection or I
kind of lost it in my collection and I
still don't like it now so again and
this is a product that I'm kind of glad
I forgot about because I don't think I
would get a lot of use out of this
however I do kind of feel like I wasted
my money I will see if any of my friends
want this but yeah that's the Mallee
face defender those are products that I
bought and I forgot there are a few here
that are really really good products
like the Urban Decay palettes as well as
the sea otter illuminating a blushes as
well as this little blush right here
from the drugstore the J cap Beauty
blushes I think these retail for like
$2.99 399
a great quality really really beautiful
want to make sure that I use these up
before they go bad and yes that's pretty
much it for this video so thank you for
joining me guys and I will see you
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
