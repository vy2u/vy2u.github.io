video is going to be my August 2016 boxy
term unboxing so if you were interested
in seeing what I got in my box this
month then please keep on watching
alright the first item I see here is the
little postcard that you get that tells
you everything that you get in your box
and the first item that I see is the
dirty little secret what is this it says
phantom what is it lip product I'm
guessing it's a lip product yeah this is
a matte lipstick in the shade phantom
and you guys know I'm not a huge fan of
like liquid matte lipsticks because
they're not super super comfortable or
not always super comfortable but this is
a beautiful shade this is like a true
true true red color and I absolutely
adore that packaging that is so cute so
here is the color phantom swatched on
the back of my hand and the next item
that I see in this month's box is the
shadow sticks 24 7i shadow this is from
the brand be for beauty for real beauty
for real so bfr and it says the shade is
called midnight marathon so this looks
like another full-size item i'll go
ahead and swatch a few guys as well it
is a retractable i shadow pencil that is
so creamy and nice it's a beautiful kind
of topeak gold color there it is on the
back of my hand so I'm very very excited
for that that seems to go on really
really nicely the next item I see here
is from M plash and flash this is a
mascara serum and it says truly bold
full long-lasting and it's new so I'm
guessing it says let's see here step 1
press brush into eyelashes near roots
step to brush out in upwards towards
your lash tips and then it says step
three repeats until desired look is
achieved so that is really really cute
and cool I'm very excited you guys know
I love me some clumpy mascara so yeah
that's really really cool it looks like
it's kind of like a lash extension and
mascara in one and the same next item
that I see here is from a low pure
skincare this is 8
repair serum and this looks like it's a
full size as well which is awesome look
at this saying it's huge so that is what
it looks like let's go ahead and pump a
little on the back of my hand so I can
see what the actual consistency is like
so I'm running low on serum so this is
pretty cool that that is in there all
right the serum seems really nice and
lightweight slightly slimy which is
pretty good for a serum that is what
serum should feel like and it does not
have any sort of fragrance to it so that
feels pretty darn good yeah I'm excited
about that and the last item that I have
in this month's a box is from Coastal
Scents this is the blush and bronzer
mini palette and brush combo super super
cute packaging and when I open it up
this is what the brush looks like first
of all really really cute it's pink and
white and it feels kind of scratchy
actually I don't like that it does feel
slightly scratchy so i'll probably have
to declutter that but the actual pilot
looks like this which is really really
adorable and here are the blushes the
bronzer and the highlight so there they
are let me go ahead and swatch a few of
them they feel slightly gritty but not
too bad there are a few of them swatch
they're obviously very very pigmented so
sometimes that matters more than the
actual consistency but yeah there they
are swatched on the back of my hand
alright guys that is everything that I
got in this month's I was going to say
glossybox the boxy charm thank you so
much for joining me and I will see you
next month bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
