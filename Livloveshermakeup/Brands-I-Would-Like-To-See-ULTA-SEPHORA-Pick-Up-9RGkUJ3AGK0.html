my channel happy Tuesday today I wanted
to go ahead and walk you guys through
some makeup as well as skincare
companies that I would personally like
to see Ulta and Sephora or both of them
pick up but now I feel like Ulta lately
has been picking up a whole lot of
brands and so far I kind of jumped on
the bandwagon so Ulta has been doing a
lot of indie brands which i think is
 awesome and then Sephora kind of
shocked everybody and jumped on the
colour-pop tray and so I thought today I
would just walk you guys through some
brands that are maybe a target exclusive
member Walmart exclusive that I hope one
day it might make it to alter Sephora
house so let's start with the balm
cosmetics so the balm cosmetics
currently is sold on their website as
well as they believe they have like a
pop up shop in California I would love
to see the balm cosmetics at Ulta I feel
like the aesthetic and the overall fit
would be fantastic in my opinion I would
love to be able to go in store and
swatch these products out if you guys do
live on the east coast and you have
Duane Reade in your area you probably
have seen the balm cosmetics at Duane
Reade about on the west coast as well as
in the Midwest there is no doing read
which is kind of like a Walgreens CVS
kind of store so unfortunately not a lot
of people can actually go in and swatch
these products out you kind of rely on
word-of-mouth and what you hear about
the products and then you end up kind of
ordering them and sometimes I know that
the mary-lou manizer is canna shatter
when they're shipped and all those kind
of stuff it would be really really nice
to be able to go in store at Alta and
swatch some products out from the balm
cosmetics I think they're a great fit I
like it that Ulta has drugstore as well
as high-end products and they fit right
in there perfectly alright guys moving
on to Charlotte Tilbury I do not know
why Charlotte Tilbury is not sold at
Sephora I feel like they are such a
luxurious beautiful cruelty-free a brand
it's very hard to find luxury skincare
and makeup brands that are cruelty free
you have like hourglass but then Dior
and Chanel and why it's not none of
those brands are so I really like a lot
of products from Charlotte Tilbury I've
been sent some from PR as well as I have
purchased my own I wasn't a huge fan of
their brushes I think they need to work
on their brushes but their skin care
products their magic cream as well as
their matte lipsticks which usually I'm
not a matte lipstick kind of girl that
says a lot and also like their bronzers
in their blush
our beautiful and silky and really
sophisticated great quality so I would
personally like to see Charlotte Tilbury
at Sephora I feel like they would do
really well online as well as in stores
all right guys moving on to hard candy
and flower beauty these are two
Walmart's sold brands and they are
exclusive to Walmart currently but they
are both cruelty free drugstore brands
which is very hard to find and because
you know Ulta has recently been picking
up brands like elf cosmetics and Catrice
cosmetics and you know wet and wild I
feel like these two brands would fit in
beautifully at Ulta in their drugstore
section so I would love to see her candy
and flower beauty at Ulta definitely not
a good fit for Sephora in my opinion but
all tough for sure
are you moving on to glossier I would
love to see glossier either Ulta or at
Sephora right now it's really hard
because they don't really have any
stores you have to order online I think
that their skin care products would be a
great fit for Sephora whereas our makeup
would be a great fit for Alta so it
could go either way but I haven't been
super super invested or intrigued by
their makeup products but their skincare
products are really really good I
recently picked up some serums during
like their Black Friday event and I just
really do enjoy their serums and just
their products in general so I would
highly recommend you guys look into
glossier and one day I hope that Ulta or
Sephora will go ahead and pick up glossy
I are you moving on to makeup geek I
feel like the aesthetic of makeup geek
would be wonderful and would be a really
nice fit for Ulta in my opinion now I
know Marlena has said that she doesn't
really want to be sold at Sephora or
alter she's made some sort of comments
like that I know she also had a little
bit of beef with Sephora at one point
because they had a Sephora play bag that
said makeup geek on it and I believe
that she has like claimed that snape you
know what I mean so nobody can actually
use that so I know she had a little bit
of beef with Sephora but I really really
enjoy makeup geek products I love their
foiled shadows I'm not a huge fan of
their original shadows but I think what
they do best is they're cheap kind of $5
i shadow pots I think that's what a lot
of people go to them for recently I've
noticed they started to slow down on
products like coming out I know the
brand kind of fell off the horse
when these sparklers came out I feel
like that's when there really was kind
of an all-time low with makeup geek I
know that Marlena doesn't personally
want to be sending PR because
unfortunately there's just a ton of
content creators that are charging an
arm and a leg
be able to show products on their
channel nowadays and I really respect
Marlena for that but I still think her
products would be a great fit for Alta
because they're right there in that
price range that's kind of between a
drugstore and high-end and I would love
to see them kind of work on their line
this year and come up with more products
that are very thin you know what I mean
the one thing about makeup geek that I
will say is lately I don't really feel
like the products they've been releasing
have really been on trend with the
current market but you know what she
knows what she's doing she's a great
businesswoman I love Marlena so I'm not
gonna say too much about that but I
would like to see makeup geek at Ulta up
next we have Sonia Kashuk
I think Sonia Kashuk could actually be
sold at Sephora I don't know about you
guys but the packaging and the overall
field the brush sets the holiday kits
and a lot of like the time and effort
that they put into the outer packaging
as well as just how good the products
are on the inside I feel like even
though they aren't really at that
competitive a luxury price range or even
high-end price range this would be a
better fit and then color pop at Sephora
in my opinion I feel like I'm gonna get
 for saying that but I really do
feel like Sonia Kashuk would be a better
fit for Sephora whereas color pop would
be a better fit for Ulta so that's just
my opinion but I definitely think Sonia
Kashuk goopy gory to be able to go in
store and swatch out some of those
products because she does have some
really really awesome product she used
to be sold at Target I sometimes see a
few products here and there on sale at
Target but it's very hard to find Sonia
Kashuk products and then finally guys
pixie again a target exclusive brand
they have some awesome skincare they
would be amazing at Ulta they would fit
right into that category but with like
formula 1006 as well as some of those
kind of in-between brands that are in
between high-end as well as drugstore I
love the pixie glow tonic and maybe if
they brought them to all so they could
kind of lower those prices it's just a
little bit so anyway guys those are some
beauty brands and beauty companies that
I would personally like to see Ulta and
Sephora pick up let me know down below
what brands you would like to see Ulta
and Sephora pick up because I feel like
currently they really are kind of on the
radar we're looking around for new
brands and new companies to kind of pick
up and put in stores as well as online
so anyway that's it for today's video
thank you so much for joining me guys
and I'll see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
