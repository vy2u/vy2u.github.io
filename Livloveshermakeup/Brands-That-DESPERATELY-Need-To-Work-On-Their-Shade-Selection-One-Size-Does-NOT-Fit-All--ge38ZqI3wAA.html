welcome back to my channel today I
wanted to walk you guys through five
different to foundation brands are just
brands in general that have foundations
but I feel like need to be a little more
inclusive when it comes to their goddamn
shade selection okay now let me know if
you would like a / - to this video and
also let me know if you want me to talk
about different products a shadow
palette some blushes bronzers that are
not very inclusive and don't have a very
diverse shade selection I feel like this
is a very very sought after topic right
now because recently fenty beauty by
Rihanna released 48 different shades of
foundation now we have brands like
makeup forever and Mac saying you know
we value at 40 foundations well guess
what they came out with these
foundations right off the back the brand
came out and they had 40 foundations to
start with that is why people are in
loving this particular foundation
especially what the brand that stands
for so I don't want to hear a bunch of
 from Mac or a bunch of
from makeup forever saying we have you
at 40 foundations will you
should because your foundations have
been around forever okay okay so 50 do
any of you guys are curious I did pick
up at this particular foundation I have
not tried it out yet I have not done in
my first impressions just because I
haven't had time but I did pick up the
shade at 150 and I will be doing a first
impressions for you guys hopefully next
week I've been getting a lot of
questions why did you pick up anything
from Fenty it will I did when it first
released I just haven't gotten around to
reviewing it yet or doing a first
impression so anyway let's go ahead and
jump right into it guys I want to start
with it Cosmetics recently Jamie Kern
who is the CEO and founder of a
cosmetics made a big mistake
going on a camera and doing a live
speech talking about how her brand is
very inclusive and how diverse you know
her shade selection is and I'm sitting
there like bitch what bitch what she has
six to eight shades in all of her CC
creams as well as her foundations this
is her CC cream and the illumination CC
cream this particular shade is called
fair I'm very lucky that this matches me
she really seems to kinda to stick in
the category of doing a lot of medium
kind of complexions and then the deep
skin tones in my opinion really don't
get a chance you really don't get a
 chance when it comes to her
product so this CC cream as well as the
original one have been around for years
now so come on you can do better and
then her new foundation here called the
bye-bye lines which I
picked up to do a first impressions on I
picked up the shade light but the deeper
shade that they happens just called deep
and it doesn't even look that puppy deep
so I just think that's a bunch of
 I think that is very very
hypocritical of her to go on there and
say I care about diversity I care about
people that have skin issues cuz she has
openly talked about how a lot of her
products have helped her and saved her
because she has rosacea and she has skin
issues well guess what a lot of people
with a lot of different skin tones have
skin issues so go ahead and open up your
shade selection and don't talk about how
you're so diverse that you include
everybody when you're down okay
thank you all right moving on we have
Catrice cosmetics so for me personally a
Catrice cosmetics it's one of those
brands were like I'm kind of okay with
it cuz I understand their drugstore but
at the same time I'm not because I'm
looking over at wet-and-wild and I'm
seeing 10 to 15 shades of
foundation okay when it comes to their
photo focus and then I'm looking at
Catrice cosmetics that liquid cockroach
foundation has four shades they're
camouflage and cream has three and
they're liquid camouflage concealer has
three shades you can do better
than that okay I do not understand I
know a lot of people have been saying
these liquid HD coverage foundation is
very similar to pentia they have
identical ingredients but guess what
nobody's gonna go get the Catrice
because there's 40 shades of this why
would you do that when there's 40 shades
here and there's only four shades there
I think that is just incredibly
inappropriate especially when this is a
foundation that has been around for a
while and it is so best-selling like
this is one of their best-selling
products right now I really hope they're
working on opening up their shade range
because guess what people do have more
skin tones meant just for shade
thank you very much are we moving on to
Benefit Cosmetics Benefit Cosmetics oh
my god I feel like they're blushes
they're bronzers they're shade selection
for foundations has always been
incredibly poor now as someone
who does have a very light complexion
all of their foundations in the lightest
shades are way too dark for me even when
I'm self tan which I am right now I know
I look like a pale bitch but trust me I
am self-taught right now so I noticed
that there oxygen Wow Foundation which
they do have let's see here
did you do seven to eight shades of that
but let me tell you the oxygen well
Foundation has been around for what
 five years now it's been around
for a long time
seven to eight shades and I remember the
porcelain shape being incredibly
incredibly yellow toned and very very
dark now I understand I really like when
brands will go ahead and say hey let's
do different undertones that's so
important okay that's so important some
people with a deep you know complexion
do have more of like a red undertone
some people with a medium complexion
have more of a yellow undertone some
people with really really fair skin meet
a neutral undertone or a pink undertone
in their foundation so I appreciate that
they did that but it is just incredibly
incredibly dark on me personally when I
look at the shade foundation or the
shade selection shade foundation the
shade selection online and I take a look
at the oxygen Wow foundation I also
seems like the two deepest shades are
really not that deep which is just
really really upsetting the Big Easy
liquid to powder foundation has two
 shades two shades well are we
 lucky if you have light skin or
medium skin you're all set with benefit
all right and then moving on they have
the Boing up brightening concealer they
have three different shades of this it's
kind of like a color correcting Sam any
kind of undertone concealer now I feel
like if you're gonna go for the
color correcting thing take you know
some inspiration from Becca who did a
beautiful shade called papaya which is a
deep a rich orange shade with a little
bit of a red undertone because people
with a very very deep complexion and
that is what they are going to use to
actually color correct darkness
underneath their eyes go ahead and take
a you know some inspiration from Urban
Decay they did that beautiful dark peach
shade you know don't just sit there and
say oh it's a salmon II kind of color
it's kind of like Bobby Brown Fisk or
this or that even Bobby Brown does
better and their color selection for
their color correctors is better than
that so shame on you benefit go
yourself alright moving on we have to
your so dr is one of those brands where
these foundations cost like $60 and up
and the only foundation with a decent
color selection is there forever perfect
foundation it has 24 different shades
but you guys are not gonna believe this
they're nude ear serum foundation only
has eight shades they're nude air
glowing foundation only has nine and
they're air flash free foundation which
is their best-selling foundation only
half 11 if I'm gonna drop sixty two
 dollars on your stupid
foundation you better have something
that's gonna be a little nice
okay I want something that's gonna match
my undertone I don't want to just pick
something and be like okay that's gonna
work for $62 go ah come on get your
together all right and finally guys we
have Stila so I personally think steal
the foundation stick in the light to
medium category if you do have a fair
complexion or a medium complexion and
they're pretty good with their neutral
undertones they're pink undertones you
know their yellow undertones you're
gonna be good but when it comes to their
deep colors it's really horrible it
literally skips from like a medium
complexion to like two dark shades oh
they have two dark shades to choose from
how unfortunate get your
together that is not fair Stila Stila
has recently gone cruelty free and I
really love their aqua glow serum
foundation in the shade fair matches me
really nicely if you can find
foundations that are matching you occur
ectly I feel like everybody should be
able to you know what I mean if I can
find something that's a perfect match
for me from Stila I want everybody to be
able to find something that's a perfect
match for that so anyway guys and that's
it for this video got a little bit of
ranting ranting live going on here I
hope you enjoyed it thank you so much
for joining me let me know down below
what brands you think suck as far as
shade selection is concerned and I guess
I will see you guys tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
