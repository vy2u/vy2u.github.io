channel today's video is going to be all
about brands that excite me so if you
would like to see some brands that are
really really exciting to me personally
then please keep on watching alright so
the first one I want to talk about is
Urban Decay not only is the packaging
amazing I love that Urban Decay is just
super super good when it comes to their
whole collection and what I mean by
super super good and not very
descriptive is the fact that they really
cater to everything they have neutral
eyeshadow palettes they have pops of
color
they have big eyeshadow palette so you
have smaller eyeshadow palettes they
have cult favorites they have lip
palettes they have literally everything
and every time I see that Urban Decay
hmm excuse me every time I see the Urban
Decay released something new especially
like on Instagram I am immediately drawn
to it again probably because of the
packaging as well
I like their face products I like their
eye products I like everything from the
brand and they just give me a really
really cool exciting a vibe I feel like
I'm never ever going to get bored of
this brand there's always something to
pick up and I also really like that they
don't over produce so although they do
you know make a lot of items they don't
over produce and they don't really push
you know collabs or collections in your
face they do a little more of like an
artsy route and they you know
collaborate and do certain collections a
lot differently than say other brands
would and I really really enjoy that so
although recently in my anti haul I
talked about two new products from them
that I won't be purchasing and let me
tell you I said in that video I really
wanted them at first because just the
overall way that you know Urban Decay
shows their products and presents them
it really really gets me excited
alright the next brand that I want to
talk about is definitely a wet and wild
wet and wild has just been getting me so
excited lately I still need to pick up
you know the photo focus foundation and
the powder and it seems like everything
that they're doing is just really really
good so these little guys right here are
the limited edition at powder
highlighters these are baked Olay
highlighters from the drugstore 399 499
absolutely amazing I think the quality
is impeccable I think what they're doing
is impeccable and I really just enjoy
how they present their products I also
love that they're cruelty free and you
know they've been doing so much stuff
that is very trendy right now and I
really enjoy that and they get me very
excited alright next we have the Becca
cosmetics eye
Bekka mostly because i feel like every
single item that I pick up from Becca is
going to look beautiful on the skin does
that make sense so it's not super
overdone it's not in-your-face like
urban decay or you know even wet in wild
has been releasing some more like
in-your-face kind of stuff I would say
the only item I have from Becca that is
really like outside of the Becca comfort
zone is probably the new shimmering skin
perfecter pressed in a prismatic
amethyst but even then you guys can see
this is actually very very beautiful
natural highlight I don't know how they
pulled off the duochrome
or the holographic trend without going
overboard so many brands kind of went
overboard and I love it I love looking
like a unicorn I love bathing in this
stuff but this is just the perfect brand
for those of you who have a really
professional life you want something
that's going to make you look pretty
they have great face you know
palettes and just great face products in
general but also they have some good
foundation some under eye corrector some
nice to lip products it's just a brand
that I get very excited about and again
a lot of that has to do with packaging
look at the new at Becca Chrissy Teigen
palette it's just so beautiful its
sturdy I never feel like this is going
to break in my purse and I really like
the thought concept so Becca is
definitely an exciting brand for me next
we do have these before a collection so
recently the Sephora collection has
really really been upping their a-game
but this was something that released
during the holiday season that I thought
was such good quality this is called the
blush bronzed and ready to glow face
palette you get four huge products in
here you get a cool tone blush a warm
tone blush a highlighter and then a
bronzer beautiful beautiful lay out
really really nice packaging and these
are very very good quality when I saw
this on Italy Sephora what was the
Instagram page I was like I need that
literally because of the packaging but I
was so surprised when I got at home and
I realized it was also really good at
quality and then they also have been
releasing these little guys right here
again a beautiful packaging I prefer
this over like the arm Stassi of Beverly
Hills glow kit packaging but you can see
they're really staying up-to-date with
trends they're doing you know
highlighting pallets a lot of these are
very similar to the shimmery skin
Perfector press from Becca but you get
them for a fraction of the cost which is
really really awesome so they are a
brand that has been stepping up their
game
really been enjoying next we do have
makeup revolution so makeup revolution
is kind of like that copycat brand but
like they don't give a you know
what I mean so what they do is they dupe
the hell out of everything this guy
right here is actually a tube for the to
face um what is it called you know that
highlighter duo I'll go ahead and link
it down below can you remember what it's
called but it's like the candle glow
highlighter duo this is so much better
quality than that I'm totally going to
be decluttering that a particular
highlighter from Too Faced just cuz this
is so good they go and they do out these
pallets that are super-high ends like
these are tour visored they do two face
and a lot of these brands get pissed off
with them and they're like what the hell
you literally just changed around the
name you know but you're selling a
palette that looks exactly like mine for
a cheaper cost and in a way I'm kind of
like and it's kind of shady but at the
same time that's what business is you
know what I mean and they're making a
lot of money and they're doing really
good they have some really really nice
quality products so I really do enjoy
makeup revolution and I always get
excited when I see that they did do bout
some sort of high-end palette they
either I can't pick up because it's not
cruelty free or maybe like I don't want
to spend the money and I go pick that up
his day alright next we have the ciate
brand now see yata is one of those
brands where I have realized these are
like the perfect pocket palette products
basically so all of their products
almost fit into like the palm of your
hand I have one of their duos it's like
a blush and bronzer I have these new
little illuminating blushes and then I
have their eyeshadow palettes I have two
of them they are beautiful they're small
they're compact very very travel
friendly and I love the packaging that
they do I think it's really really
beautiful I will say sometimes I'm
worried about things being super sturdy
in there I feel like sometimes if I were
to you know toss this across the room it
would like break open up like most
makeup void but you guys know what I
mean sometimes I feel like the pan it
might actually pop out but for the most
part beautiful packaging good products I
mean I won't say every single product
that I've tried from them is amazing but
that goes for all the brands that I'm
sharing with you guys right now but you
know when they release new products
especially like that new trend mood eyes
shadow palette that they are kind of
like doing sneak peeks of on trend moves
Instagram I'm super excited for that
like I want that because of how
beautiful the layout is the packaging
all that kind of stuff so they're
definitely a cruelty free brand that
does excite me
yeah and then next we do have the
Anasazi of Beverly Hills brand and this
is actually the last brand I want to
talk about and normally people say that
they get really bored of Anasazi of
Beverly Hills because they don't do a
whole lot I feel like their brand is
starting to expand a little more I would
have liked to see them do more
foundations and concealers before they
did like the lip Palace but I still use
the lip palette I take that when I am
traveling or when I have concerts but
lately I have been so inspired and just
like in awe of their Glo kits the Aurora
glow kit is the latest release it is
absolutely beautiful I feel like they've
been kind of fooling around with
different formulas this is a gorgeous
gorgeous glow kit and then here we have
the moon child which kind of started it
all you know what I mean this and the
Kat Von D Alchemist I feel like really
started that do a chromatic holographic
trend and it's just so beautiful such a
good price point and every time they
have a new glow kit and they sneak
preview it or whatever I'm like I need
that in my life so those are brands that
excite me definitely let me know down
below what brands excite you and I will
see you guys my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
