thank you for joining me I hope you guys
are having a great day today I will be
reviewing for you guys I have it pulled
up here on my Sephora page so that I can
get the name right for this product it's
a very long name it is the based on me
cosmetics or best MV cosmetics boudoir
long hair finishing powder brush so I
purchased this for $50 yes 5-0 it's a
far website it's quite pricy but it
looked very luxurious and even says I'm
here in luxurious boudoir brush for face
and body and it comes in this cute
little packaging like this it's really
really just like oh I don't know I feel
very posh like with this packaging and
the actual brush looks like this it is a
long hair I believe this is these are
synthetic bristles um it is like this
long gorgeous fluffy softest brush you
will ever touch it looks like this it
has this little plastic handle I know it
looks like it's like bronze or something
it's just colored that way it is
actually plastic and it says the base on
me and this is a French brand yeah I
mean base I mean yes so this is a French
brand and I really have not tried any of
the products from the line and I just
was so taken by this on the Sephora
website it just looked so beautiful it
was like the picture was like this and I
was like oh my God look at that brush it
is definitely the most expensive brush I
own and also probably the most luxurious
this is really one of those brushes that
you use just to take off X like excess
powder or excess product after you are
done it basically for me personally it's
like a finishing brush so I apply a lot
of powder I like to really mattify my
face before I'm gonna put anything
glowing on it or just in general I
really like to lock in my concealer and
my foundation or whatever I'm wearing
that day if it's just foundation you
know whatever I really like to lock in
my wet products so I put a lot of powder
on and I do not like swirl it on I
really kind of stamp it on and Pat it on
because I wanted to really lock in the
wet products that I have on my face so I
tend to sometimes get depending on what
kind of powder I'm using I tend to get
that kind of cakey look definitely
around my nostrils you know in certain
areas it just starts to kind of pile up
and look a little like texture on your
face which is not cute so um the point
of this brush at least for me what I've
been using it for is to take it after I
have applied all my powder products and
I literally just dusted all over my face
that has nothing on it
I'll just dust it and it will pick up
all of those little cakey sections
without taking away coverage and I know
that that sounds like oh my gosh $50 for
a brush that does that you really could
do that with like any fluffy brush but I
have never found a brush that does it as
well as this does so that is basically
what I've used it for it does say on the
website you can use it for blush and
like contouring I don't see how I just
don't see how I think that it just like
it's too big it's not gonna work like
that um I would say just a lot of the
things that they mentioned that you can
use for it probably wouldn't work
however the other thing I do like to use
it for is for the body it's very very
like big and luxurious it will hit your
chest area down your neck area that even
like you know if you want to put some
glow like on your arms or just kind of
like bronze up your skin this will take
care of it really really quickly it kind
of reminds me of like the elf that big
elf
like Buki sort of brush or like the one
from Becca or even like the NARS one
like they're so big that they really can
be used on the body too and I love
taking like a little bit of shimmer down
or even some bronzer kind of I've been
wearing a lot of bronzer lately you know
it doesn't really look like it but
sometimes my neck gets a little darker
than my body so just taking bronzer down
a little bit with this brush it's so
easy and so fast and it's really easy at
blending any kind of like line you may
have that you definitely don't want so
overall that's probably my favorite way
to use it is to help take off any excess
powder especially on the days where I
went a little heavy-handed just at the
end of everything before I you know
sprayed my setting this just kind of run
it over my face and I think that's
really beautiful I don't necessarily go
over my eye area because I do like to
blend that out with you know my kind of
eye brushes and things like that but
definitely around the nose like over
here just it really just picks up the
tiniest amount of product that just over
does it on your face if that makes that
so that's my favorite way to use it and
also for my body to lightly dust on any
kind
bronzer or shimmery powders things like
that so I actually love this brush I
know it's so expensive and a lot of
people are probably going to think it's
not worth it but I really really love it
well lighting just changed a lot sorry
about that guys it just got really
really cloudy out um but overall I
really really love this I think it's
great
um I know it like I said fifty dollars
very expensive if you are somebody who
obviously doesn't like do a lot of stuff
by like putting bronzer on your body or
anything like that or if you don't use
powder or something you probably will
not find any use for this brush however
if you are one of those really really
heavy-duty beauty people that put on a
lot of powder like I do or you know
wants to bronze up their body really
quickly like every day this is a great
brush to do that with so I'm gonna read
for you guys a little bit about what it
says on the actual Sephora website um it
says the base underneath cosmetics
boudoir along here finishing powder
brush it is fifty dollars and it says
what it is a collectible brush with long
bristles for creating a near flawless
airbrushed finish what it does is it
says sweep on powder formulas with the
easy to use boudoir long hair finishing
powder brush this vanity brush features
synthetic bristles that seamlessly blend
into powder formulas for a flawless
looking barely their makeup look its
handle design is inspired by makeup
brushes used by top makeup artists
during the 1930s and it's ultra soft and
easy to clean and by the way I will say
I used this today but I did clean it
already all I used was my BH Cosmetics
it's kind of like the Mac like the
really really quick one where you just
spray it onto the paper towel and dust
it and it has alcohol in it so it like
dried instantly I haven't found any
issue with cleaning this I know that it
looks like it's so it really is I mean
amazingly soft probably one of my
softest brushes but um it looks like you
know maybe it would need extra like
special washing I think they do have
something on the Sephora website that
says how to wash it but I have had no
problem with washing mine with like a
normal shampoo baby shampoo and also
just like the easy little spray um what
do you call those like the really quick
little cleansers for your brushes I use
that today and it hasn't you know been
like misshapen or anything
and it still is soft so just wanting to
put that out there right away it's not
difficult to clean it says brushes used
by top makeup artists during the 1930s
and it's ultra soft and easy to clean
what else you need to know best time you
brush ins base many brushes aren't
designed to bring back glamour and
luxury to the process of creating your
look they make expert application
effortless designed to buff powder or
cream with the finest synthetic hair it
blends color with ease and glide
seamlessly into the skin the handle is
designed to resemble brushes available
to Hollywood makeup artists during the
1930s it is easy to grasp comfortable
and well balanced in your hand wash hair
only in warm soapy water as needed and
air dry so yeah it does have like a
little thing that you know it's only to
do that but I haven't had any issues
than I've been using this for like two
or three weeks now so um let's see here
unbelievably soft the superior synthetic
fiber hair feels like silk on the skin
the feel is addictive and the smoothness
of the finish at least behind is
breathtaking this product is cruelty
free so anyway that is a little bit
about the boudoir long hair finishing
powder brush such a long name but um I
love it if you're a big like makeup geek
like I am and a big makeup like a holic
and you just want everything that's
Beauty related this is not like a
necessity by any means but if you
absolutely love and collect you know
makeup things this is definitely a
lovely little thing to have in your
collection if you want something that's
like if you're not really as into makeup
like me or like a lot of the girls here
on YouTube then you probably don't need
this in your collection but if you are
you know really into this kind of stuff
it is a nice little addition so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video please give
it a thumbs up if you did and I'll see
you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
