welcome back to you at my channel my
goodness today has been a struggle as
far as filming is concerned and I have
spit all over my lip goodness gracious
okay so you guys know that I have been
wearing these really glittery eye looks
all week so many of you have requested
like a tutorial on it so I attempted
this morning to go ahead and film this I
look on the DSLR camera the DSLR camera
is so beautiful I know you guys love the
actual quality of it and I agree it
looks really good and nice and crisp and
clean but today I realized that if you
do want to film a tutorial or something
how do you like get ready with me on
that camera you have to have someone
standing behind the camera because like
when I was moving my brush and stuff
like that it kept focusing in and then
focusing out it was a total hot mess so
basically I had to trash that footage
and I am here to share with you guys my
family how to rest today and then we're
also going to do a follow up haul from
the Sephora vib sale so anyway the
majority of the products that I was
using as fails and holy grails this week
were from the Sephora vib sale so I
thought we were just kind of sh mush
them together and then tomorrow I will
do look of the week for you guys I know
I normally do fails and holy grails on
Sunday but today we're just gonna flip
flop them and yeah I hope you guys enjoy
so let's go ahead and jump right into it
we are going to start with the kind of
fails for the week now I don't want to
say that these are necessarily like huge
fails because there's something that I'm
thinking about keeping around in my
collection I'm pretty sure I just said
on snapchat today I was like I'm gonna
keep them but you know what I feel like
if you spend a lot of money on a product
like $30 on a concealer you should
really think you know if I don't love it
should I keep it so these are two
products that I am questioning should I
return or not so the first one is the
Stila glitter and glow liquid eyeshadow
in the shade Sunset Cove this is one of
the duo chromes it is very similar to
the one that I have on my eyes today if
you're curious I do have sea siren on my
lid and then I do have the shade umm
what is it - this one right here right
oh which one is it smokey storm yeah
smokey storm on my lower lash line so
this particular shade Sunset Cove is
really really beautiful but the formula
on it the duochrome is different you
really have to kind of Pat these onto
the lid
you cannot just swipe them on like the
other ones because they just don't have
the same sort of pigmentation so anyway
for me personally I feel like this one
is really lacking pigmentation the color
is really beautiful and it is a little
different than the sea siren shade but
it's just something that I'm like okay
it's very very expensive it's
from the other ones I already have six
other ones do I really really need this
so it's something that I'm contemplating
about keeping in my actual collection
but you know there might be a chance
that I return it so I will keep you guys
updated on that but that is the shade
right there it's called Sunset Cove and
next we do have the other little kind of
fail that is the NARS radiant creamy
concealer I'm not feeling this you guys
the shade that I have is like one
Chantilly and I just feel like this is a
very thick formula and then it blends
out to almost nothing on the eyes I
prefer the Too Faced Born This Way
concealer I'm sure that I'll probably
prefer the urban decay on naked skin I
have swatch that one before it seems
like it has a nicer formula I just
really don't like the Demi matte
appearance that this gives when it says
that it's creamy and it's gonna be
radiant I expect more of a glow and I
really just don't get that with this so
that is what it looks like I honestly
don't think it's anything special I
think the Maybelline concealers are even
better than this so again is something
that's very very pricey still deciding
if I want to keep it in the collection
or if I want to return it alright let's
go ahead and get into the more Holy
Grail products the first one is the
Sunday Riley ceramic slip clay cleanser
both Tom and I have been using this this
week it's a little kind of a high up on
the list we're gonna kind of work our
way down because now we do the feels and
holy grails countdown style and you know
the top 5 spots are lower down if that
makes sense but this is one of those
products where I really hate the smell I
really don't like the consistency but I
feel like it works so Tom said the same
thing he feels like it's very very slimy
on the skin both Tom and I do have combo
skin he's a little more severe combo so
he's very very oily and his t-zone very
dry on the outer perimeters I'm actually
kind of like that too this time of year
we feel like we're going through this
very quickly you guys can see we've
literally had this for what five six
days now we've used quite a bit and I do
feel like it does deep clean at the
pores I don't feel like it makes the
pores shrink or anything like that I do
feel like it makes your skin look really
nice and clear but it just has that
strange scent to it it's got that
strange consistency and I do feel like I
get the same sort of benefits from
something like my tea tree oil cleanser
from the body shop so I don't think it's
necessarily important to pick something
like this up for $45 I don't know if we
would repurchase but it is something
that we're still enjoying because it
really does help to remove it the oil
and the impurities in our t-zone and I
do think it helps a little bit with
breakouts so that is why it's still a
little Holy Grail it's just not
thing that I think I would repurchase
again next we do have the Becca under
eye brightening corrector now the reason
why this is a little higher up on the
list it's still a Holy Grail but the
reason why it's a little higher up is
because it really does have a formula
and a consistency to it that you have to
work with so it is extremely extremely
thick I don't know if you guys can tell
but it is super super humectant kind of
sticky kind of tacky but the color is
beautiful
this particular color reminds me a lot a
lot a lot of the Urban Decay color
correcting fluid in the shade pink so if
you want to try something like that with
a little more of like a salmony
undertone this is beautiful however if
you have never worked with this kind of
formula before you're really not going
to like it right away I have been really
buffing it into the skin with a brush
this week and I just put it on before I
go in with my foundation I kind of go in
the areas where I have more blue tones
so right here and then right here I
don't try and take it everywhere around
my face or anything like that because it
has this very sticky tacky kind of
consistency but I'm used to it because I
did go ahead and try out the backlight
color correctors all five of those i
decluttered those and then also I do
have the concealer in the shade praline
it's the same sort of formula it takes a
little bit of getting used to very very
sticky and tacky if you don't want it to
feel as heavy on the skin I would highly
recommend blending it in with a sponge
but still really good and I am enjoying
that next we do have the Beca first
light priming a filter so I'm actually
really enjoying this a lot you guys I do
prefer the first Ollie a little more
which I'll show you guys in a second but
I think this is really really wonderful
if you do have more copper or oily skin
I think this just sits really
beautifully on the skin it gives a tiny
bit of a glow a tiny bit of hydration
but it doesn't look like a plaster of
like shininess on your face my issue
with the backlight priming filter is
that it just looks very unnatural
honestly on my skin personally so I
really have been enjoying this I don't
know if the color correcting is that
crazy or anything like that and the
scent is a little on the like pledge
side smells like lemon pledge you guys
thank you kind of smells like a chemical
lemon scent but for the most part it
really is nice and I am enjoying it as a
primer so yeah that is something that I
have been enjoying next we do have
before Sully unicorn essence I really
really enjoyed this way more than the
first light and the reason for that is
not so much because I'm using it as skin
care I know a lot of people were telling
me to go look at Stephanie Nicole's post
on Instagram talking about why this is
not good
for us skincare I'm not using a skincare
I believe I mean I believe her a hundred
percent okay there's guys in here it
does smell like marshmallow it's got
shimmer in it all of that kind of stuff
and just looking at it honestly makes me
not want to use it as skin care what I
do like it for is as a primer and I
think the reason why it works so well as
a primer is because it gets very very
sticky and tacky on the skin you guys
can see it's a pink kind of fluid and I
just press it into the skin and then
immediately go in with my foundation and
I feel like it does help with the
longevity so that is something that I am
enjoying it it's not something that's
going to fill in your pores it's not
something that is going to camouflage
anything it truly is just a makeup
extender and I'm really enjoying it next
we do have the Tarte CC colored clay eye
primer this is something that I wasn't
really loving on during the winter time
but I'm really enjoying it right now
because my eyelids are starting to get a
little more oily and I feel like this is
a very very dry of formula it's just
something that has been really really
good and it's been working very well
with these Stila
eye glitters this week now this you do
not have to use like a glitter glue with
those Stila glitter and glows and a lot
of people are worried because they are
bound in there with a really really nice
kind of liquid a sticky formula you
really don't have to use anything
special so this has been pairing
together really nicely but those I also
have tried them out with my Maybelline
eye primer and it worked just as well
all right next on the list we have the
NARS orgasm blush now the reason why I'm
this isn't like further down in like the
top 5 category is just because I feel
like these are really really firmly
pressed you guys and I think you really
have to kind of work into these blushes
before you get what exactly what you
want so I do have to use a little more
of a densely packed a brush to really
pick this up and put it onto my cheeks I
cannot apply this with a super super
fluffy brush today I did and I just feel
like I didn't get as much impact as I
would have liked that is what the color
looks like and honestly everybody talks
about how orgasm is so peachy and it's
so beauty bheegi bheegi bheegi know this
looks very very rosy on my skin so if
you do have more of a cool tone fair
complexion expect this to look a little
more rosy on you than peachy I think
it's beautiful really really been liking
that - the longevity is pretty darn good
not as good as I would say the what is
it
obviously Becca no put the Too Faced
love flush - blushes those are my
favorite as far as longevity is
concerned the Tarte 16-hour blushes are
good as well this is not as long wearing
but still pretty darn good next on the
list we do have my mask
appearing for the week now this started
looping up my eyelashes today but the
first mascara I went in with was the
ultra plush drama myth Ulta plush drama
mascara very very wet formula and then I
have been topping it with the Maybelline
the falsies push-up drama this guide
today this was the end of it I applied
it on this side and I just was like it's
gotta go it's not that it started to dry
out it's just that it's too wet now like
it is completely done it is getting too
gloopy you can tell when you look at a
wand and it literally is just like
packed with product and you can just
tell when something has gone bad so this
is going to go in the empties bin and
then I will show you guys tomorrow when
I do the eye look and all that kind of
stuff I'll pair it with a different
mascara but the two went really really
nicely together and honestly the more
that I use the ultra plush drama mascara
the more I love it it does have a
natural bristle wand very very wet
formula like I said but you can see it's
really really nice and soft and it
actually looks quite good as a base
mascara alright next on the list we do
have the Laura Geller Beach not baked
hydrating bronzer in the shade sunrise
fair I'm really liking this right now
because I am self tanned and it gives a
very very nice kind of yellowy undertone
it's very silky and soft to the touch
unlike some of her other base products
um but yeah I really like this because
it goes really nicely with my
self-tanner it has definitely a yellow
tint to it so if you don't like that you
would not like this but it's been really
beautiful from me this week so I've been
loving that I also as usual have been
loving my essence all about Matt fixing
compact powder i panned the other one
that i picked up from the alta 21 days
of beauty event you guys I go through so
many of these I need to start telling
them up the way that I tally up my what
is it the elf tone correcting powder and
cool a lot of you were asking me like
how the have you gone through 60 of
those I started telling them up after I
noticed I had gone through like 15 and I
was just kind of like a fun thing for me
to do but I feel like I probably gone
through at least 50 of these like in the
last year I'm not even kidding beautiful
beautiful powder might not work as well
if you do have a deeper complexion just
because it does leave a little bit of a
white cast but I really like it for my
fair complexion really really good for
soaking up the oil in the t-zone and
then next we do have the Anastasi of
Beverly Hills of brow Wiz pencils now I
don't love the shade of blonde I feel
like this is a little too warm tone for
me but the taupe shade is quite nice I
really really only like these the most
because of the spoolie I know that
sounds absolutely crazy but the spoolie
is really really perfect I feel like it
just like
pushes up the brows in a really really
nice way it's very densely packed it
doesn't get as dirty I really really
enjoy that but I would say you know the
NYX micro pencil all that kind of stuff
very very similar stuff so maybe this
should have gone up higher on the list
is just something that I just grabbed
right away but it's definitely not a
fail it's just not something that's like
absolute must-have would purchase again
I only purchase them because they were
on sale at the altar 21 days of beauty
event but honestly you can get stuff
just as good as that as just as good of
it just as good as this at the drugstore
I've been talking for too long you guys
alright moving our way down we do have
the NARS the velvet lip lights in these
shades density ria and laplace these are
definitely in the top five category
because they are beautiful and luscious
and gorgeous I love this formula you
guys know that I talked about the bound
shade all the time but you have really
really been enjoying these I think the
pigmentation is amazing they fade so
incredibly beautifully on the lips like
I don't know what it is but this formula
is incredible and the shade density RIA
is actually really really nice on the
lips as well they smell like cake
honestly this is like the best lip
formula ever if you are someone who
loves really really comfortable lip
products you would absolutely adore
these next we do have the NARS
what is this all day luminous weightless
foundation obsessed obsessed I have
never had a foundation that has given me
such good coverage but remains so
lightweight on the skin I did pick up
the shade light three go be now I was
color matched to Siberia when I went in
but I wasn't cell tanned at the time I'm
self tan now so I went for this one it
still is a little too dark for me a
little too yellow tone but it's
beautiful gorgeous gorgeous frosted
glass bottle as you guys can see it has
a pump it goes on so beautifully really
really light consistency like I said but
gives great coverage so I'm very happy
with that I feel like this is going to
be a go-to for the summer as far as for
me as far as the summer is concerned and
the two of these together yes yes
the first kala unicorn essence and this
really really are a good match and then
we also do have the bite of beauty a
mousse bouche lipstick in the shade a
honeycomb love this formula love this
shade really really nice neutral kind of
rosy tone but not rosy tone I don't know
it's just neutral you guys it has a pink
undertone it's got a warm undertone but
it's a nude it's gorgeous I am NOT
someone who usually can wear new
lipsticks I look crazy when I wear new
lipsticks I
look like I am dead or I look like it's
way too pink or darker red this is just
amazing really really been enjoying that
and then I have been loving absolutely
loving my NARS audacious lipstick in the
shade of Brigitte it is what I have on
today and I have been wearing it for two
hours now I have not had to reapply
these are so long wearing now they are
not as creamy and buttery as say the
amuse-bouche lipstick formula but they
are still really really beautiful and a
lot of you were saying that you really
love this shade and I agree completely
look at thatshe look how beautiful
really really enjoy that want to pick up
some more of these and look at this yes
that magnetic closure and finally you
guys the number one spot obviously and
has to go to the Stila glitter and glows
like I said the only shade that I'm not
absolutely in love with it is the Sunset
Cove shade I'm just stumbling all over
my words these that psycho shade but the
rest of them are absolutely fantastic my
favorite one is definitely C siren from
the duo chromatic line and then as far
as the regular formula is concerned I
still really like my smoky storm shade
which is what I do have on my eyes today
violet vixen did stain my eyelids a
little bit a lot of you were asking
about that but there is the shade C
siren that's what I have on my lids gold
goddess is really really beautiful I do
think I prefer the silver shade over the
gold this one is a little more patchy I
don't feel like all of these are created
equal you know what I mean but for the
most part these are pretty darn good and
I really really enjoy them and I mean
I've just been loving these I've been
loving them as far as into the blue is
concerned this one definitely has the
most pigmentation as far as the duo
Chrome's are concerned but I don't think
it's nearly as pretty on the actual eyes
as the C siren shade so I still prefer
that one but really really beautiful I
just I really like these I really really
enjoyed them so anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow for the look of the week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
