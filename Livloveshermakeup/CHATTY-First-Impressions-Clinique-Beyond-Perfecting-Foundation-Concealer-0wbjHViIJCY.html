I hope you are all having a fantastic
weekend so far today is going to be
another marathon video day I hope you
guys don't mind once in a while you know
I really try to post every single day
but once in a while I feel like posting
three or four times a day and today is
going to be one of those days again so
we are starting off my little marathon
of videos with a first impressions
review this morning on the Neo Clinique
beyond perfecting foundation plus
concealer I purchased this for $27 in
store at Sephora and the shade I picked
up is 0.5 breeze which I believe is a
Sephora exclusive shade and also I
believe this is the latest one the
Clinique girl told me it was the
lightest one so let's hope it matches
and there are 21 different shades of
this foundation that you can get online
and in store which i think is amazing
they do offer more options on the
support comp website than the Clinique
com website because I think that support
does have a few Sephora exclusive shades
so definitely check Sephora if you're
interested in this foundation but like I
said is $27 which is did I say that yes
it's $27 which is a really really good
price for a foundation you get one fluid
ounce in here which is a standard size
for foundations and yeah I'm really
really excited to try it out and the
reason I had not tried it out yet was
because I wanted to wait until I was in
my cycle
I know TMI but I tend to get lots of
uneven texture and little spots and
sometimes cystic pimples that pop up
during my period and I thought because
this is supposed to be such a perfecting
foundation it would be a nice way to try
out like the foundation when I actually
was really having a lot of issues with
my skin and my skin definitely purchased
a lot during at my period so I'm having
some little tiny like bumps that are
underneath the skin on my forehead I
have one here that's definitely gonna be
turning into a big cystic pimple and
then I'm starting to get a few down my
neck which is very very common for me
since I do have hormonal acne and it's
very common for me to get her around my
jawline and down at my neck area so I
thought that this would just be a good
way to try this out honestly I hope you
guys aren't too girl style by that TMI
thing you know me telling you about you
know me being on my cycle but I just
thought it would be a great way to try
it out and see if it actually does cover
the
it claims it well now on the clinique
comm website it does say to shake this
up before you use it and it also
recommends not freaking out well they
recommend not like freaking out right
away with your shade I guess because
this is such a pigmented foundation the
pigments in here there's like so many
pigment how did they describe it on the
website they said basically it's so
pigmented that it actually shows up
darker on your skin when you first apply
it and then it gets lighter as it
actually starts to dry down and I'm
really happy that I read that because I
probably would have complained instantly
if this was too dark on my face because
you guys know me if there's one thing I
like to rant about it's the fact that
foundations are too dark for me all the
time so I am really happy that I read
that on the clinic home website because
I was like okay I'm not gonna freak out
if it looks a little dark when I first
apply it because it is so pigmented
that's just what they recommend they do
recommend to shake well like I said and
let me read a little bit about what it
says on the back of the actual box it
says a foundation and concealer in one
for a natural beyond perfected look that
lasts all day lightweight moisturizing
makeup covers thoroughly without
clogging the pores a little bit clogging
the pores color stays true even though
even through sweat and humidity it says
for complete coverage dot on all over
face and blend use the unique applicator
to spot conceal and it is oil free so on
the Clinique Darkon website it also said
let me show you guys what it looks like
so when you open it up it comes with
this big like doe foot applicator they
said that one application is supposed to
be enough for your entire face so we
will try that out and if I feel like I
need to go back in and spot conceal I
guess I can do that as well and I may
want to put on two layers who knows
because I really have a hard time
believing that that amount is going to
cover my whole face and give me the
desired coverage that I want but I guess
we'll see so anyway it does say on here
that it is a two and one foundation plus
concealer it is lightweight it's
moisturizing and it is oil free so let's
just get right into it shall we I'm
gonna pull up my hair back with my
little beaded headband a few of you were
asking where I got this I got
at forever 21 it was like $3 I love it
if you guys are curious I always do
lists down below or I try to now I try
and list like what I'm wearing and
things like that I do get a lot of
questions about what I'm wearing or like
you know my hair accessories or stuff
like that I have started to listed those
in the description bar if you guys are
curious alright so I have already pulled
out a few items I just want to see I'm
curious to see what it is that I'm going
to want to blend this foundation with
like does that make any sense
I don't know what he's going to apply
this foundation the best it's what I'm
trying to say so I did pull out my Sigma
ground kabuki f82 brush in case I want
to use this to buff it in I also have my
damp a Real Techniques sponge and then I
have my fingers so I won't be able to
tell right away once I put it on my face
I'll be able to tell by the texture or
the consistency of it which tool I want
to use because if it's a really really
thick I'm gonna want to use a my Real
Techniques sponge if it's just kind of
like medium kind of silky and has a
little bit of a silicone tube Ethicon
feel I'm definitely I'm gonna want to
use a my buffing brush and if it just
goes on really kind of I don't think
it's going to but if it goes on really
really like sheer then I'm just gonna
want to use my fingers so anyway let's
do that I do want to tell you guys right
away it did cleanse my face already with
my Garnier skin active micellar
cleansing water this is the sensitive
version with the pink cap and uhm what
else do I need to say I think that's
about it I'm sorry I know I went on for
like five minutes but I just wanted to
let you guys know kind of some of the
claims on this foundation and yeah let's
just get right into it so I am going to
go ahead and open this up and we are
just going to take this doe foot
applicator and I guess put it all over
my face like that they recommend so
we're going to start with just one I
already feel like this is not going to
cover anybody know there's no way it
didn't pick up enough at all I'm sorry
no Clinique they say you just dip the
doe foot applicator in and then pick up
and that's supposed to cover your entire
face I don't think so so we're just
gonna go ahead and scratch that and just
go back in and I'm just going to apply
the desired map amount that I feel like
I need I will be honest this kind of
smells a little funky like paint and
also I don't like this little doe foot
thing for foundation I'm okay with it
for my
age rewind concealer but this just feels
weird like I'm going to be spreading
bacteria all over especially right now
when I have active breakouts because of
my period
this really isn't picking up that much
product either sorry I'm Marty ranting
it's like a 6 a.m. and I'm already
ranting about things all right so I'm
just putting this all over and I can
tell already by the consistency that I'm
going to want to blend this in with my
Beauty Blender so let's just insert it
so it's not my Beauty Blender I'm sorry
it's my Real Techniques sponge I'm just
gonna start blending this in actually
that is nice coverage hey that is
actually covering quite well it
definitely is leaving a bit of a pink
tone on my face I don't know if they're
picking up on camera but I feel like
that actually does cover quite well but
in a little more I don't know how it's
showing up on camera but I'm liking what
I see in my mirror I definitely think it
is full coverage I'm going to go ahead
and add a little more around my eye area
since I'm not going in with concealer or
anything like that I want to see how
this foundation does don't foot
applicator is freaking huge this just
feels weird alright put some on my
eyelids and underneath my eyes do you
guys get really red eyes not red eyes
but red around your eyelids during your
cycle Girl Talk I tend to get very red
around my eyes for whatever reason not
like my actual eyes just around my
eyelids I don't know why alright so I'm
taking the little pointed ends now and
we're gonna blend this in and see how
well this can cover as a concealer
around the eye area it's a little bit of
tingling around my eyes and I don't
really like that I do have combination
sensitive skin it's not the most
sensitive but it is a little sensitive
and I don't like that little tingling
sensation that I'm getting around my
eyelids right now but that's okay just
letting you guys know
all right so this actually is covering
very well I mean it really looks nice it
has kind of like a dummy matte finish
but it has a little bit of glow to it
like it is actually moisturizing like
they claim let me take it down my neck
you pimples right there as well um the
color actually looks pretty darn good it
looks really dark in the bottle but I
feel like it's actually a really nice
shade match for me I don't notice that
it looks too dark when I first applied
it they did say that it will be a little
more dark when you apply it and then it
lightens up but I don't really notice
that if anything I noticed that it is
pulling a bit of a pink undertone um but
that's okay it's not really that's not
really bothering me so overall I think
that looks actually very nice I actually
really like the look of this so now I'm
going to go back in and do what they
said you should do and kind of use this
two spot conceal certain areas so
obviously I have some spots right there
some spots right there and I'm going to
go a little bit right here where I have
some acne scarring around my jawline
just to see if we can build this cover
it up because I feel like it's not very
cakey on the skin which is great because
then you can start to build layer upon
layer if you want to like me if you'd
like to go all out and take that base so
I'm just putting it on a few little
spots I felt like it really did conceal
under my eyes quite nicely it's tingling
a little bit on my eyelids I don't
really know what's going on with that so
we're just gonna leave that area alone
but let's see how well it builds looks
pretty good I feel like it does actually
feel a lot because I just notice that
that looks a lot less visible I will say
a little bit of the product is starting
to build around the fine lines around
the side of my mouth but I feel like
because it is so full coverage is
probably why but I feel like it does
build nicely I mean this little like
spot concealing thing is working because
those little pimples that I had there
are a lot less visible and I feel
my skin just looks really really nice
it's really covering up little age spots
that I have hyperpigmentation acne I'm
gonna go one more time around my eyes I
know that it is tingling a little bit
but I just want to see if it could
actually cover dark circles what is that
he's a hair get out of there all right
so let's go underneath let's see if it
can do that I'm curious oh it really
tables in my eyelid guys what's
happening you don't like that um I just
want to see if this can actually that's
an area where I tend to look very tired
because I really don't I don't get great
amounts of sleep but ever I mean hello
it's the weekend and it's 6:00 a.m. and
I'm already up so um I just wanted to
see how it could cover up dark circles
and it actually looks pretty darn good I
feel like I look a lot more awake so
just going to make sure everything is
completely blended I do feel like I'm
wearing foundation not gonna lie I do
feel it on my skin it feels a little
heavy but it doesn't feel super cakey or
anything like that this is what it looks
like I am going to go ahead and um mmm
don't have a white for my lips but I'm
gonna go ahead and set this in now it
just let it sit for a second and see
what it kind of dries down to what I'm
seeing is kind of like a Demi matte
finish hmm my lips look so Mariah what
I'm seeing is a Demi matte finish that's
actually kind of nice because it's got a
little bit of luminosity to it and I
feel like that is because it's quite
humectant and moisturizing so now I'm
gonna go in with my essence all about
Matt fixing compact powder and my it
cosmetics Buki buffing brush and I'm
just going to go in there and I am going
to go ahead and set my face and this
powder is like hella matte so I want to
see what the actual um finish of the
foundation looks like once I put a very
very matte powder on top I'm already
liking the way that
very very full coverage and very very
pretty so I feel like from my combo skin
if I am going to wear as much as I just
put on which was like two layers two or
three layers I would definitely need to
set it in with a powder because it does
feel quite him acting and moisturizing
and I wasn't really I don't know I kind
of rolled my eyes when I read that claim
on the box because usually um full
coverage and moisturizing don't go
together you know what I mean it's more
like sheer coverage and moisturizing
that go together so this is a really
nice surprise I'm liking this coverage
guys I am really really liking this and
there's a little more powder around my
t-zone so I can completely set that in
don't be freaked out by this powder it
goes on a very very stark Oi and then
you just kind of blend it in and it's a
wonderful one though from Ulta alright
let's take a look all right so I like
this foundation I can already tell I
feel like it covers really well it
covers my acne scarring it covered my
dark circles underneath my eyes that
covered any active breakouts I have I am
liking this this looks good um it got
stuck all over my lips and made them
look extremely chapped but besides that
I really do like the way that this looks
on my skin very very beautiful it just
feels very very comfortable and nice and
it doesn't feel as heavy I mean I can
definitely I definitely feel like I have
foundation on my face right now but it
doesn't feel as heavy as it did before I
said it too which is weird because of
course I quote powder on and you would
think that that would make it feel
heavier but I need to feel it a little
more lightweight to get it in my hair
which is gross but um loving this so far
really really loving it it feels
relatively lightweight for such a heavy
coverage foundation and I just like the
finish I really like the way it looks
with that really matte powder on top I
mean it looks like I put concealer on
and I did
and I'm in the middle of my cycle which
is crazy so yeah loving this so far I
will be back in a week to give you guys
my final thoughts on this product I hope
you enjoyed this first impressions and
I'll see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
