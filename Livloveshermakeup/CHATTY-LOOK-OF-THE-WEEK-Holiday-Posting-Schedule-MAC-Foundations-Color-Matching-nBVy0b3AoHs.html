welcome back to look of the week where I
recreate either at my most requested
makeup look I was wearing this week or
my personal favorite and this week we
are going with the most requested the
most requested a makeup look I was
wearing hands down with some makeup
ahead on a Wednesday or the makeup I was
wearing on Wednesday it was kind of like
a slate gray almost purple iikind of
smoked out eye with like plain lips like
literally no lip product on and very
very nice kind of heavy foundation you
know that sounds weird nice heavy
foundation but I mean a really really
flawless looking face so that is
actually what I wore for two concerts
this week I didn't want to wear anything
where I had tons of lip products on
because they rub off on my food head
joint anyway and then also I really
wanted my skin to be looking really
really nice and just smooth and pretty
and I wanted a little bit of a dramatic
eye so that is the look that we are
going to recreate today so let's go
ahead and jump right into it I'm sorry
if my voice sounds a little like this
you know I just woke up it's a one of
those days so anyway let's go ahead and
get started I have already put all of my
skincare on and it has pretty much
completely sunk in there's a little bit
of areas here where the oil may be still
be there but for the most part it has
sunk in so we're gonna just jump right
into a face primer the face primer I
have been wearing this week is the Stila
aqua glow perfecting primer I am just
going to go ahead and apply this all
over my face like so and I love this
primer it's very very nice that is
something I'm trying to use up in 2016
and by the way in this video we're gonna
chat a little bit about my posting
schedule for the holiday season because
they know some of you are curious I did
talk about it on snapchat but I know not
everybody has snapchat so anyway I'm
then just gonna go ahead and kind of
push it into the skin and this primer
does kind of go really really tacky once
you do blend it into your skin which is
great because the foundation will really
adhere but also it does kind of dry down
to a powder finish but I find it's
easier if I just press it into the skin
alright moving on we're gonna go in with
eye primer and the eye primer that I
have been wearing this week's time
looking in the viewfinder trying to make
sure that I'm focused completely because
the focus on this camera has been laying
out of whack for sure but anyway and
this is the eye primer I've been using
this week it is the benefits Air Patrol
BB eyelid primer I'm gonna go ahead and
do one click of this and apply that to
with my eye
on each side so anyway yeah so for the
holidays this year I will pretty much be
posting every single day except for New
Year's Eve New Year's Day let's see here
Christmas Eve and Christmas Day Hanukkah
so there will only be with the next two
weeks like five days where I don't post
I hope you guys don't mind but I just
don't feel like really posting on the
actual holidays I know that I did that
last year
and I really like oh my goodness so a
lot of you were telling me that you kind
of missed that I didn't post on
Thanksgiving this year and I felt really
bad like that is why I'm going oh my god
I felt really bad because I had promised
that I would post on Thanksgiving and a
lot of you were saying you were looking
forward to that you didn't have like
family to spend time with I feel
absolutely horrible so I do apologize
for that that is why I wanted to let you
guys know kind of the posting schedule
ahead of time so I'm not gonna be
posting on like Christmas and Hanukkah
and like Christmasy things like that but
it will be posting pretty much every day
besides that so I hope you guys are
saying for that so anyway if this is the
foundation I've been wearing this week
this is the Estee Lauder Double Wear
foundation the shade that I wear is one
and one I've renewed and I have been
mixing this together this week with this
little BIOS onto the nourisher precious
rows of face oil I really like the way
that this face oil just kind of lightens
up the foundation if that makes sense
this particular shape is a little I'm
taking about a dime-size amount on the
back of my hand by the way and I'm gonna
take three or four drops of the oil and
mix that together so this particular
foundation in Pine opinion does have a
little more yellow tones in it and I
just not like the biggest fan of that I
really wish they had more of like a pink
undertones one because I do have a cool
undertone which by the way a lot of you
were wondering it's gonna be kind of a
chatty get ready with me but a lot of
you are wondering why I talk about Mac's
foundations like how I always say that
I'm a cool undertone yet I wear an NC 10
or 15 and Mac foundations because if you
didn't know that max color system is a
backwards so the reason for that is
because I actually got color matched for
literally snot coming out of my nose
lovely I literally got color matched for
the NW 10 say the last time I was in Mac
but I just thought it was way way way
too pink and it didn't look good now
to take my damn poultice punch I'm gonna
go ahead and blend that in but yeah I
got matched at Mac like for an n @ w10
or n to be 15 foundation and it was just
way too pink toned and I really don't
have a neutral undertone I really do
have a pink undertone but I thought that
one just looked way too pink so that's
why I went ahead and asked for the NC NC
is definitely very yellow tones and I am
decluttering the foundation that I had
picked up those the studio sculpt but I
just wanted to put that out there but
yeah this particular foundation
definitely pulls very very yellow toned
as well but I love the way it looks when
I mix it together with that oil I just
feel like it gives a little more life to
the foundation it looks a little more
skin like and not so mask like I do
think that this foundation it's not as
bad as like the Kat Von D Locker but I
do find that my skin tends to look a
little caked on sometimes if I wear it
just flat out without any oil so I'm
just going ahead and blending that in
you guys can probably see on the back of
my hand it's a little yellow toned so
anyway I don't know if I should just
start picking up like a neutral
foundations or what I really don't have
a neutral undertone I'm truly ma cool
undertone but some of these foundation
is this go so freaking pink you know or
they go so yellow I'm like well jeez
can't we just get something right in
between alright I'm taking that down my
neck as well and after I have completely
blended that yet I'm gonna go ahead and
jump into concealer so the concealer
that I have been wearing this week is
from Maybelline and this is the a master
conceal in the shade at number 10 fair
and I'm taking a big glob of this now
because I was on stage a few times this
week or two times I have been concealing
kind of going heavy with the face makeup
so I'm gonna take this underneath my
eyes kind of in a triangle on my eyelids
as well and then a little bit down at
the bridge of my nose on my chin and
then right there so anyway I know a lot
of people sometimes are like oh my god
you wear so much makeup when you go
onstage but honestly you need it you
need it when you're up there under those
lights so yeah that's why I'm showing
you guys this because normally I don't
feel like I wear that much foundation I
don't know if I do I used to wear so
much foundation when I was younger a guy
that was ridiculous I look like such a
cake face but I feel like I've gotten a
lot better yeah when I'm on stage
I'll take that face I cake that face so
anyway I am just blending that in with
again at the damp ultra sponge but yeah
so I hope you guys are okay with that
posting schedule for the holidays just
want to give you a heads up that I will
not be posting on Christmas I know I
posted last year on Christmas because I
was doing a sample week which do you
guys want to see another life segment of
sample week I love doing sample week
that was where I literally just used Sam
samples for a whole week
and every night I would come on and I
would share with you guys my sample
empties and once we know what I thought
at the actual product that was like a
lot of fun I enjoyed that but I'm very
very excited to see my family for the
holidays I would love to know what you
guys are doing let me know down below I
was gonna say in the description bar
know in the comments section I'm gonna
go ahead and wipe my lips down and then
we are gonna go ahead and set our
foundation I can't believe this is
already a seven minute video I told you
I'm wearing a lot of face makeup this
week alright so I'm gonna take this
Nicole can see leo this is technically
like a foundation brush but I'm gonna go
into my essence all about Matt fixing
compact powder and I am just going to go
ahead and stipple this on it to my skin
really really concentrating in the areas
where I tend to be a slight more only a
slight bit more oily and that is in my
t-zone if you didn't know but I love how
densely packed this brushes I feel like
it really makes the skin look very even
and pretty and as this essence all about
Matt fixing compact powder when you do
use it with a more intensely packed
brush it leaves a little more of like a
color deposit and since the Estee Lauder
Double Wear is a little dark on me this
will lighten it back up to match my neck
so yep just going ahead and stippling
that on and I don't know if you guys can
see I'll show you up close in a second
it just looks so beautiful this this
particular brush really picks up powder
nicely it doesn't go very quickly like
you can smack it on your face really
quickly but you guys see how that looks
I feel like that looks so pretty on the
skin so anyway going ahead and blending
that in taking a little more around my
nose area and let's go ahead and move on
to blush
so for Buster's week I have been using
at the torch artists the blush palette
this is
what it looks like and I am going to use
this shade right here which is called
dream it's just a beautiful cool tone
kind of Mabi pink color holy do you
see how chapped my lips are holy crap
girl anyway I am taking my up and up a
blush brush I think I'm using the exact
same brushes tapping off the excess and
putting on to apple of my cheek but I
think I'm using the same exact brushes
that I use the last week which I'm
pissed about because I have never done a
brush collection video but I can tell
you guys I have a lot of brushes I have
a lot of brushes and literally like
three drawers filled with brushes hmm
like the Alex series 9 Dora yeah yeah
yeah like three doors filled with
brushes which is crazy so I really need
to start going ahead and when I shop my
stash I also switch out my brushes but I
feel like I just get so attached to
certain brushes that I don't want to
switch them out but I love all the
brushes I have in my collection so it's
not like these are the best ones that I
have even better brushes but I just kept
attached to using the same one over and
over again I guess alright so I am just
going ahead and putting that on to kind
of the apple of my cheek and then
blending upwards I love that color and
now I'm gonna go in with this little guy
this is the vintage vintage vintage
illuminating face highlighter in rose
gold from Jessica live skint
I kept seen liber skin but it's leap
skin or live skin so and then some weird
blessing this is what it looks like it
is a beautiful beautiful highlight but I
have been using it as a blush topper
because I'm obviously quite pasty and
fair so I'm just gonna go ahead and take
this Nicole concealer brush right here
very soft and silky I'm tapping into the
product it's very chunky so you don't
want to take too much and I'm just
putting it on top of the blush that we
just apply it's gonna give a little bit
more glow to the skin and it's also
gonna help this brush will help to blend
out the blush that we applied so it's
kind of going ahead and putting that on
especially so still Gately it just feels
like a little little baby ass wait all
right and then I'm gonna go back with my
powder brush and I just like to go and
stipple on the outer parts to make sure
we have no harsh lines now we're gonna
go ahead and I'm quickly gonna set in my
face which we know is kind of weird but
I want to make sure that this foundation
like stays a put this is the NYX and
matte finish long-lasting setting spray
I'm just showing you guys exactly what I
did a few days ago and this is what I do
when I'm getting onstage like I will use
a setting spray in between each like
section of makeup because I need it to
stay on my face all right now I'm gonna
go ahead and do my brows so I haven't
doing anything special with my brows
this week you guys know I love made me
believe instance drama pomade cran
whatever the it's called here it is
where is it where is it where is it
right where is it okay I have no idea
where it actually what there it is so
this is the Maybelline brow drama cran a
pomade in the shade blonde or taupe
remember which one it is I don't know
how many shades they have I think they
have new shades but this is a really
nice kind of Ashley color and I just
love filling in my brows with this so
I'm just go ahead and fill in the front
part of my brows I don't do much with my
brows you guys can watch me for a while
you probably know that I'm just kind of
filling in the front of my brows here I
need to sharpen this because it's
starting to get a little too worn down
and then I do like to hit the area where
my arch is I'm making a lot of comments
lately about my eyebrows saying that
there's like little bits of gaps and
stuff like that last time I had a lupus
flare up I did lose quite a bit of
eyebrow hair and I'm just too lazy in
the morning to actually go ahead and
fill in each little section that's the
truth so anyway I'm just going ahead and
spooling them out just like that's an
eye don't put any kind of like brow wax
or gel in them lately just because I
want them to look somewhat natural it's
okay if there's chunks missing you guys
it's okay alright moving on let's go
ahead and jump right into eyeliner so
what the eyeliner I'm going to use is
these some ash box always sharp
waterproof coal liner in the shade storm
so originally this week I'm gonna put
this on my waterline and smudge it out a
little bit on my lower lash line so
originally this week
was wearing the Urban Decay 24/7
glide-on eye pencil in the shade and
Moon spoon and like I stand by that I
think it's beautiful but I started
reaching for this a little more because
it doesn't have shimmers or glitters in
it the other one does and I just really
like the way that this looks I love
these eyeliners so I'm gonna take a
little bit on my lower lash line as well
and I will warn you guys ahead of time
this eye look that we're doing it looks
very messy as you're like putting it
together I was backstage putting this
eye look together a couple of days ago
and even someone was like girl you look
like you have like a black eye like
that's how that's how intense it looks
it's like sometimes you need those you
have you recreate those eye looks that
really really look messy and tell you
like until the last night you know until
you have like all your mascara
everything so that's kind of what we're
doing but yeah I smudge it out a little
bit on my lower lashline Memphis eye is
a little watery so I don't want to
irritate it too much just taking a
little bit and it really doesn't matter
if it's super messy you guys because
we're gonna be smudging out color on the
lower lash line anyway so let's go ahead
and jump into the eye palette I have
been using the studio makeup on the go a
cool down eye shadow palette this week
this is what it looks like and we're
just gonna jump right into it so here
are all nine shades if you guys are
curious we're gonna start with this one
right here they don't have names so I'm
just gonna point out which ones I'm
using I'm going to take a sigma e40
brush I'm gonna go into that color it's
got a little bit of a pink undertone and
I'm gonna take that all the way across
my lid and all the way up to my brow and
then there is a shade right below it
which is a nice cool tone kind of dopey
color and I'm in a very powdery I'm
gonna go ahead and take that into my
crease I really do like this palette you
guys but I will say it is very very
there's a lot of fall outs a lot of
glitter stuff like that so I'm just
working this in as my transition kind of
going all the way on my lid and into the
crease you know a little sloppy because
it doesn't matter
we just want to deposit a little bit of
color so that it's easier to blend into
the shadows out all right moving on I'm
gonna take my morphe EMB 13 brush which
looks a little something like this and
I'm going to be taking this shade right
here which is kind of like a plummy
color I'm going to tap into that tap off
that excess and start working that into
my crease I really have been in love
with this MV 13 brush because I feel
like it really gets right into the
crease and then you can go in with like
a Sigma e30 or like an m5 11 from
morphine you really can kind of blend it
out but I like that it really deposits
the color in one place and this is the
shade that's gonna give us a little bit
of like a purpley look to the eye so
just kind of building that oh you're a
car racing down there alright and I
definitely recommend tapping these off
you will get fallout with these shadows
a lot of you warned me of that and I
agree completely but I do think the
looks that you can create with it very
pretty
next time I take a sigma e35 brush and
I'm just gonna go ahead and start
blending of that out bringing it a
little higher above the actual crease
like that next we're gonna go in with a
crown a brush is what is this e-330 Pro
blending crease brush a lot of people
not a lot of you I have like two people
that were asking me last week when you
don't have a lot of lid space I don't
have a ton of lid space how do you pack
color onto your outer V without it
taking over your whole lid so wait to do
your lid color until the lasts like
that's the last step so go in with your
crease color then go in and do it your
outer V I like this brush because it's
smaller and it really just kind of packs
on that color there the shade that I'm
taking is the darkest and the palette it
is that kind of dark gray slate gray
color tap off that excess and then just
start kind of packing that on to the
outer V and into the outer part of the
crease and then you can blend that out
again with that a35 brush but yeah I
would just recommend smaller brushes I
learned that little tip from Emily Noel
83 I am NOT a professional makeup artist
in any way shape or form but she was
talking about how she doesn't always
have like tons and tons of lid space
don't worry we'll blend everything out
she was talking about how she doesn't
have tons and tons of lid space and I'm
like that too so when she recommended
just smaller brushes I was like oh
obviously so again taking that Sigma e35
and just going and blending in circular
motions this time so yeah that's what I
would recommend if you don't have tons
and tons of lid space I def
we don't have tons and tons of lid space
so I just wanted to uh put that out
there alright now we're gonna go ahead
and blend the hey thud and went above
it's hard with these darker shades to
when it does get a little bit about the
crease to blend that out a little a lot
so I'm gonna go back in with that really
really light kind of shade I'm just
gonna blend that area right there so
that it doesn't look too insanely
obvious all right now we're gonna go in
with this little guy this is a pencil
brush from Sigma this is the e30 brush I
better take that same slate gray color
tap off that excess and work that
underneath the lower lash line this is
where I think it starts to get really
muddy and kind of crazy looking until
you get like your mascara on but it's
okay
these things happen
all right then I'm going to go back with
that where is it the one that we went
into our outer-v with at the C 3:30 Pro
blending from crown and I'm going to
blend out to that lower lashline color
just going kind of back and forth to
kind of smoke it out and it really
starts to just kind of line up with the
what is it with the I forgot what I was
going to say it lines up with something
guys right and then go back in with that
brush again and kind of work it into the
crease just to make sure that we didn't
lose any color while we did the blending
back in with the e35 just blending
blending blending and then I'm going to
take that whitish color again and hit
underneath the brow so we still have a
little bit of lightness going on and
then we are gonna foil a shade on to our
lid so I'm gonna take the Urban Decay
Naked 3 double sided brush should be
smaller side right here I'm gonna go
ahead and foil that with my setting
spray again the NYX matte finish and I
am going to dip into this shade right
here right here right here
upside down guys alright so I'm going to
dip into that shade and we're gonna
start going ahead and packing that on to
the inner part of our eye here I guess
the inner third and I really like the
way that it kind of blends together with
that slight gray color and gives a
little bit of like a pinky purple II
sort of effect I think that's very very
pretty and again doing the same on the
other side
I still feel like that's not blended
right there oh well it's okay I'm not
bothered not bothered alright and then
we're gonna go in it with that what does
this like this fluffy brush again from
Nicole can see Leo just picking up any
sort of fallout that we may have gotten
taking that Sigma e35 again and just
hitting the outer part of the eye to
make sure everything is properly blended
you can even go in with that transition
shade and kind of lightly dust right
there again you know that is pretty much
it as far as eyeshadow is concerned now
I'm gonna go ahead
and take some mascara so I'm gonna curl
my lashes first which yes I have been
curling my lashes again I have not been
curling my lashes very very very very
long time so I'm just kind of pumping
the wand gently try not to rip out my
eyelashes and then I'm gonna go in with
my mascara the first one I've been using
this week is the ultra ultra hmm the
Ulta plush drama mascara and I'm going
to put one layer of this on it to my
eyelashes starting on the lower part and
then going up and then I'm going to go
in with my Laura Mercier extra lash
sculpting mascara see how much of a
difference that makes like once you put
the mascara on it just makes the eye
look not as sloppy I mean you really can
perfect it and keep blending and doing
all that stuff but I just
alright then I'm going in with my Ulta
my Laura Mercier extra lash sculpting at
mascara so early in the morning when I
told me this you guys oopsie-doopsie
wait for this to dry before you try and
swipe it off so I'm putting that on to
my lower lashes and then a coat onto my
upper lashes and then we will break down
our lips quickly so like I said I
haven't been doing anything with my I
have been wearing different lip colors
this week but for this particular look I
wasn't wearing anything because I was
going on stage and I didn't want it to
be rubbing off all over so Chloe I'm
going to wipe those down before I get on
stage I do put a little bit of like a
balm on just come moisturize them just a
little bit and then let's go back in
with that Sigma e35 so we can kind of
blend out that mascara bit right there
alright so that is it guys this is look
at the week and this is the look that
you guys requested I recreate for you I
hope you enjoyed this video thank you so
much for joining me and I will see you
guys tomorrow for my pets and how-to
videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
