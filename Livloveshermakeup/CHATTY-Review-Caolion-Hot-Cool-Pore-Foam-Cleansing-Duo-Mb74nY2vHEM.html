to my channel thank you so much for
joining me when you guys are seeing this
it's probably later tonight this is the
only time I can film today sorry it's a
little dry and itchy but anyway this is
the only time I can film today is 5:13
in the morning I'm a morning person
though so it's totally good my hair is
up in like those little like crocodile
clips and you guys I'm having one of
those days I should have washed my hair
last night do you guys do this where
it's like you really need to wash your
hair but then you don't and then you put
it in a ponytail and no matter how much
dry shampoo is in there there's like
little gaps like between your hair like
how dirty it is that's the kind of hair
today that I'm gonna have today so I
thought a cute little like bodycon dress
and a scarf and some cute earrings would
distract my co-workers from being like
what is wrong with your hair but anyway
I am here to give you guys a review
today and I obviously don't have any
makeup on but I thought that's okay
because this is a skincare related item
one of my subscribers actually requested
that I do a first impressions or a
review on this product after seeing it
in my Sephora haul than I did on
Saturday so I had already used the
product if that video was pre filmed
like on Friday and then it went up on
Saturday so I did try this for the first
time like Friday night so I couldn't do
a first impressions because it wouldn't
have been a first impressions so I'm
here to give you guys a review I've been
using this for four days now I've been
using this at night four times now and
this in the morning four times now for
four different days so anyway I am just
gonna give you guys my thoughts and my
opinions on this little product
I haven't even announced what it is yet
this is the ko lion where is poor
steamed blackhead foam cleanser and pore
tightening cooling foam cleanser I
purchased this on the sephora.com
website
it was $24 I will link below where you
guys can pick it up if you were
interested is not affiliate link but
this is what the outer packaging looks
like really really cute it's pink and
blue and I believe that this is Korean
on one side you have all of the
ingredients and directions and that's in
Korean and then you have everything in
English on the other side so I believe
that they are looking obviously they are
and like Asian skincare brand
have been really really popular lately
at Sephora and I love it because Asians
know their skincare okay seriously
my boyfriend's Asian and he takes really
really really good care of his dad when
I first started dating him out like stay
home like he I'm sorry but really it's
like an attractive thing when like your
man like takes care of himself and he
like literally he have like Peter Thomas
Roth cleansers and I was like I didn't
even have to like get those so okay I
digress
anyway um this is what the actual
packaging looks like so I'm so so
excited to see when this release just
because it was a new product it was only
$24 and it sounds so cool so what a
whole section is the pore blackhead
steam foam cleanser and it comes off
like this these are like a little
stackable like I don't know you know
like those little toys that kids play
with I feel like that when I'm I feel
like I'm playing with the toy with this
and then the one on the bottom is the
pore tightening cooling foam cleanser so
basically you use the pink one or the
red one at nighttime and then you're
supposed to use the blue one in the
morning the red one helps clear out your
pores it heats refines and exfoliates I
really agree with that but the blue one
deep Huff soothes and softens I do lose
that so overall I like only one of them
and the machine but at the same time I
will use this one up I love this one
it's the blue one that I like but I will
use the red one up just because there's
not tons and tons and tons of product in
here and also it's just one of those
things birthing well if I have it I'll
use it I will say the smell of this one
on the top is absolutely offensive it
smells like poison
it smells like poison and I told my
friend that I'm face time the other
night
don't change the topic but anyway it
really smells bad
and it basically it supposed to be this
like thick it's very complete
consistency as you guys can see and
you're supposed to basically coat your
wet skin with this and I want to show
you guys really quickly it has brown
sugar like little tiny pieces of brown
sugar in it and they claim that this is
going to exfoliate and refine your skin
there was barely a me
little pieces of brown sugar in here
okay how is that going to refine my skin
if there's barely any inner and I just
can't get over the scent I mean it's
just disgusting so basically what they
recommend is to put this on to a wet
skin let it sit for about ten seconds I
let it sit for about a minute because
with this one I don't really notice like
a heating sensation I honestly get more
like heat or like steamy like sauna like
describe it like spa-like cleanser
feeling up from my bozo detoxifying
black cleanser if you've ever used that
that have active charcoal in it and when
you rub it in it's like warms up on your
skin this one's supposed to be the same
sort of thing but it really doesn't and
on top of that I just feel like the
exfoliating beads are not even there I
have combination skin so I love anything
that has exfoliating particles in it but
I don't feel like this refines or
exfoliates and I don't really feel like
it heats up very well however if the
little one on the bottom is amazing I am
definitely one of those people like I
love using something cool like cooling
and tingling I know some people don't
like that feeling and would prefer the
heat but I always prefer the cool so
this one is supposed to deep pop soothe
and soften your skin I'm not gonna say
that it softens the one thing I will say
about both of these is that they rinse
off a really beautiful beautiful leaf
they do not leave any sort of residue on
your skin they're not going to overly
dry your skin and they're not gonna
leave you with any sort of film so I
really like that about this so this is
the insistency of the second one as you
can see there are no exfoliating beads
in this one it is just like kind of like
a minty green white paste you can see
this one's kind of like a tan one and
this is like minty white green it smells
amazing it smells just like mint kind of
a little bit of like menthol eucalyptus
if you don't like that smell but Eisley
you're not gonna like it but I'm a big
fan I really really enjoy it and they
say to just apply this the same way so
you go ahead and wet your skin you're
going to put the product on I didn't
move it around a little bit and you only
really need a little bit as you guys can
see a little goes a long way with both
of these products which is great um okay
you're gonna let it sit on your skin for
a little bit I would say up to a minute
but this one really does start to like
tingle and feel cool on your skin I
really love it
I
don't feel like it like do you can just
my pores or anything like that but I do
feel like if you cost and you want to be
really careful I think like keep it away
from your eyes anything with like
menthol or minty and I'm guessing this
one too much I've died if this came here
my eye it smells so bad
um but yeah this is like I got it like
right up here in this area on my
cheekbone and it was just too much my
eyes started watering and it was like
whoa so definitely just keep it you know
you can even just do it like in your
t-zone if you're really oily but I like
to just go on my forehead right up here
not anywhere past my cheekbones and then
I take a little down my neck I'll let it
sit for about a minute or two and just
like tangles and it feels so so good and
then I like to rinse my face with warm
water to kind of like have some contrast
because when you're rinsing with warm
water and you have like a cooling
product on your skin it tingles even
more so I really really love that one
and as you guys can see they get a
little tacky I just wanted to show you
guys they get a little tacky after
sitting there for a while so I was like
you're doing like a little like mask for
your skin every single day so anyway my
thoughts are that I like one of them
over the other um if they do end up
selling these separately I will
definitely purchase the pore tightening
cooling foam cleanser because I think
it's absolutely awesome and I love the
sensation that it gets my skin however
the pore blackhead scheme foam cleanser
I mean I just wouldn't repurchase and I
wouldn't repurchase this little duo
because I would have to have this one so
hopefully they will make them separately
and I can get the pore cooling one
because it's amazing and it smell so
good
No yes so I hope you guys enjoyed this
review thank you so much for joining me
I see mnx on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
