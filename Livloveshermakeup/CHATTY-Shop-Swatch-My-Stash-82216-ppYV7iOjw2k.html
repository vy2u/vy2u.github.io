channel and welcome back to chef and
squash my stash where I sure I feel like
I tried to say fail some holy grails but
it came out chef and swatch mustache
anyway welcome back to shop and swatch
my stash where I share with you guys the
makeup I am currently wearing on my face
and also the makeup that I will be
wearing all week long so the first item
that we have here is going to be a
primer and also a setting spray this is
from NYX this is the matte finish
long-lasting setting spray and I like to
spray this on before I go in with my
primer on my face primer and also my eye
primer and then after I have put all of
my makeup on and then for eyeshadow
primer this week i will be using my one
dollar elf primer eyelid primer it
eyelid primer in the shade sheer this is
what it looks like I know the elf has
recently released a lot of new eye
primer so I really want to try some of
those out let me know down below if you
have tried any of the new ones out and
because I really do like that one for
foundation this week i will be using the
Rimmel London's stay matte liquid mousse
foundation in the shade 010 liked
porcelain and that is what I'm wearing
obviously on my face right now I really
wanted to use something that was super
super heavy coverage because you guys
have been having a hard time with my
skin lately a little TMI i recently
switched from birth control to an IUD
because i was having issues with birth
control giving me blood clots in my legs
when i had like a lupus flare-up and
that can be potentially deadly so anyway
i switch to an IUD and instantly you
know it doesn't have those skin effects
basically like birth control does so i
started breaking out like a lot and I've
been having a lot of texture issues and
I doesn't help that it's summertime so
that's been difficult as well so I
wanted to use a really heavy coverage
foundation this week and like I said my
shade is 010 light porcelain this is
what it looks like it's a very very
thick moose as you guys can see and this
is quite similar to one of my all-time
favorite foundations which is from Tarte
and that is the Amazonian clay full
coverage foundation so i will be using
that as my foundation this week to set
um that in i will be using a new powder
that i'm absolutely obsessed with i
already know this is going to be a fail
at the end of the week I mean I fail
goodness I cannot talk it's too early
this is going to be a holy grail at the
end of the week this is the maybelline
superstay better skin skin transforming
powder it has salicylic acid in it in my
shade is no
for 10 a porcelain this is what the
actual compact looks like it has a huge
mirror and then it has a little sponge I
wish it was just all product because it
is quite pricey for the amount that you
get in here which is let's see here how
much do you get in here it doesn't say
why don't you say how much product is
here I don't know how much product isn't
here but I do know that it was quite
expensive but it's definitely worth it
this is a very very silky powder and
usually when i get powders that have
salicylic acid in them I find that I
don't know if you guys can see that but
I find that my skin looks really really
patchy like the foundation underneath
starts to ball up but not with this one
it's absolutely beautiful it's almost
like a blurring powder so I really like
that for browsing this week i will be
using the Physicians Formula butter
bronzer in the shade bronzer so this is
a new one to be I picked this up in my
drugstore makeup haul collab video if
you guys saw that from Ulta I have both
of them now and I compared the two side
by side the light bronzer to this one
this one definitely has more of a cool
undertone but it's a little lighter in
tone if that makes sense so book that
didn't really make sense it's cooler the
other one has more of a red color to it
but this one is lighter in tone I guess
that did make sense so there it is watch
it's beautiful it gives a really really
nice finish to the skin and I am wearing
it today really really enjoy that and
then for blush this week i will be using
two of my Too Faced love flush long
lasting 16-hour blushes on these shades
i will be using our i will always love
you which is this beautiful kind of
peachy coral e color and let me swatch
it for you guys I thought this will go
really nicely with the eyeshadow palette
i'm going to use so there is i will
always love you and then the other one
is called let's see here how deep is
your love which is a hot coral and like
I said I just think these will go really
nicely with the eyeshadow pal i'm going
to show you guys so there is how deep is
your love hot coral color really like
this it's kind of similar to Pomplamoose
in v jaclyn hill palate is so there they
are how deep is your love and i will
always love you r it and wait i will
always love you how deep is your love
how goodness gracious guys kind of
hotness today alright moving on to
highlighter yes I will be using the /
cosmetics Rodeo Drive highlighter i
recently picked this up and i did a
review i will link it down below if you
would like to watch i think this is
beautiful so
is what it looks like and yeah I really
enjoy this I used it with a fan brush
today just for a really nice light
dusting of highlight but you definitely
can build this one up so there it is and
then let's see here for eyeliner i have
a shadow stick and also an eyeliner so
the one that i have on today is the bomb
cosmetics mr. right now eyeliner pencil
in the shade Jack and I got this in I
think an Ipsy bag a couple months ago I
had never really reached for it and it's
just a really really pretty kind of um
bronzy cool toned color so there it is
that's the one I have on my waterline
right now I'm filming this in the
morning so right now it's still on my
waterline pretty well but I guess we
will see how it holds up throughout the
day and then I also wanted to bring in
the beauty for real shadow stick I got
this in one of my subscription boxes
this month and its really soft and
blendable I got this in my box each arm
and I thought this would be a nice
eyeliner i usually use shadow sticks as
eyeliners just because i don't really
like cream shadows i know a lot of
people to you i'm just not a fan but
this one is actually really really
blendable it has a little bit of slip
and silicon like texture to it so i
could use that kind of as an eyeshadow
base as well before I use my palette or
as an eyeliner we'll see I feel like
because it is kind of buttery maybe it
wouldn't last very long on the water
line so we shall see about that for
brows this week I'm going to be doing a
two-step brows which is kind of
interesting i don't know if you guys can
even tell but um normally I'm just like
a no-fuss kind of girl with browse they
either don't do them or I just use one
step but i will be using my BH Cosmetics
flop flawless brow pencil which is one
of my all-time favorites it has a
spoolie on one end and then the pencil
on the other and it's just a really nice
light kind of color and it's a very very
dry pencil which is good because it's
kind of like mistake proof if that makes
sense in the shade i have is blonde and
then i will be going into set that in
with thee i will be going into set
bedded why can't they talk today i will
be using the models co more browse to
set that in and this is basically just a
tube for the benefit gimme brow the
shake that javis light flash medium it's
a little more cool tones than the
benefit gimme brow in light / medium but
it's still quite nice
no that recently there's been a lot of
different brands that have come out with
like dupes for this product I heard that
what's it called Catrice cosmetics no I
don't know there's some brand at Ulta
that now has that as well I think its
essence actually they look a 2 dot
99-cent one and it's just as good as
benefit gimme brow and I love benefit
gimme brow but it does give me a little
bit of like breakouts in my brow area
and I honestly thought I was crazy until
I was watching Tara or Tara babes here
on YouTube and she was saying she had
the same problem so I probably won't
purchase that again because I think it's
in like the twenty dollar range whereas
he can get the models Co for like seven
dollars or you can get the essence one
for like three dollars so like that and
then i will be using this Maybelline
chic natural single this is what it
looks like this is a product I'm trying
to use up in 2016 the shade is 15s linen
and i will be using this just to go all
over my lid i guess you could say and
underneath my eyes just for like a
little bit of like a nice cream matt
sort of color it's not completely not it
has a little bit of iridescent to it but
just the smallest amount it doesn't look
like there's like glitter underneath
your brow is like a highlighting shade
and the reason i wanted to pull that in
is because i'm using the lime crime in
venus palette this week and there's some
gorgeous colors in here perfect for
summertime and also fall but really
perfect for summer because it's got like
really really warm tones in here but the
reason i wanted to use that chic natural
singles because this highlighting shade
right here is very very glittery and i
just don't want to wear that like right
under my brow i'm wearing that one today
actually on my lid so that is the shade
called aura and this is what the palette
looks like it is so pretty and it seemed
really really nice today when i used it
i've only used this a couple of times
like in total so yeah I'm pretty darn
excited I think the colors are perfect
for summer and really really pretty and
I didn't get any fallout with these
which is awesome so anyway there are a
few swatches for you guys very very
pigmented they're not like super super
buttery like a lorac Pro eyeshadow which
by the way did you guys see the lorac
pro 3 pallets only thought it looks
amazing I can't wait so yeah Stephanie
ass get my hands on that but it's not as
buttery as like a lorac you know pro
formulation but it's still very very
pigmented they blend out point
the shades that I have on my eyes today
are let's see here aura on my lid and
then I have shell in my upper crease
rebirth in my crease and then also
rebirth on my lower lash line so really
really liking those shadows so far and
like I said no follow-up whatsoever with
those all right as far as mascaras
concerned this week I will be layering
to drugstore ones the first is the
Physicians Formula organic wear mascara
in black this is just the regular
formula it has a really nice fluffy
brush that looks like this and I feel
like you're really volumizes on my
lashes nicely and then I will be going
in with my Maybelline the falsies push
up a drama which you guys know is one of
my all-time favorite mascaras as well it
does have a really like wet slick sort
of formulation so I have to be a little
careful during the summer time to make
sure that it's not going everywhere but
I still really do like that and then um
for lips this week I will be going in
with my fresh sugar nourishing lip balm
advanced therapy to use as kind of like
a lip balm before going in with my lip
products it's a really nice kind of
creamy but not greasy looking balm and I
have a little bit of color to it that
actually really helps with like kind of
like evening out the lines in your lips
but also I feel like it's not I don't
know it has like a little bit of color
to it so kind of like camouflages the
lip color too so if you're really really
kind of red lips like I do which
sometimes they don't look good like what
first thing in the morning when you wake
up they're just super red and kind of
chap looking I think that that kind of
helps and then I won't be going in with
my Too Faced lip insurance original Demi
matte anti feathering lip primer I
haven't reached for this in a while and
I just wanted to go ahead and grab it
because i will be using three new color
pop lippies if you guys saw my Hall
yesterday you saw me Holly's again I
feel like these are going to go really
well with the blushes and outs of the
eyeshadow palette this week so the first
one is the color pop ultra metallic lip
and the shade is called flitter it's the
one that have on my lips right now not
quite sure about the formulation yet but
honestly the color is really really
really really really beautiful it's like
a gorgeous gorgeous kind of rose gold
and it just catches the light so so so
so nicely and then I also will be using
the color pop ultra glossy lip in the
shade cheat code and this is a
formulation more like a really nice
gloss and I feel like I'm probably gonna
like this formula better than the ultra
metallic lips it's definitely a little
more pigmented and a little more glossy
and I get the feeling it's going to be a
little more comfortable to wear and then
also i will be using my other one over
to the colour-pop ultra metallic lip in
zebra I just really wanted to try these
out this week and again I thought they
would go really nicely with like the
warm kind of look that I'm doing on my
eyes this week and also there's a few
cool tone shades in the Venus palette so
that would be beautiful with that so
those are the three Lippi's that I will
be wearing this week and because they
don't really know the formulation like
this my first impressions of them I did
want to go in with that lip primer like
I said alright and then they last week
last three items i will be using are
like products that i kind of show on a
weekly basis i don't know if you guys
want me to show these or just show them
at the end but i will be using my bare
minerals complexion rescue tinted
hydrating gel cream as my face primer
this week I have one more week to use
this up completely it's supposed to be
empty by I'm September first from my
project pan and I'm about right there
this was where I started I'm like so
close you guys so i'll be using that as
my primer it's a little Gracie which is
why I really wanted to go in with a
matte foundation as well and then I also
will be using my dandelion shy beam this
is a nude pink matt radiance highlighter
again a project pan item I started there
i'm like almost finished so i'm just
going to be using this to kind of color
correct and conceal right underneath my
eyes where i have blue tones and then
also my eight cosmetics bye bye pores
for list finish airbrush powder in the
shade translucent I thought this paired
really nicely with the Maybelline better
skin today I did a little bit of the
buffing technique but you can also just
use it as a finishing powder so those
are all the items i will be using this
week let me know down below which you
will be using this week what you shopped
your stash for and yeah i will see you
guys tomorrow actually no i'll see you
at 7pm for my glossybox unboxing yeah
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
