got a sniffly nose I'm not feeling so
hot tonight I normally do all of my
filming in the morning and today I
wanted to do my top 10 hair products
that are under ten dollars and I also
was going to do my review on the new
laura geller cushion bronzer if that's
not going to happen because you guys I
was just having a runny nose this
morning and then suddenly it turned into
a stomach ache a little later in the day
I got home from work I peep didn't think
I puked on the bathroom floor and in the
toilet and I know that sounds crazy
you're probably thinking what are you
doing here right now on camera well the
reason I'm here is because I feel like
immensely better you know how sometimes
you get sick and then you feel better
when you throw up I don't know I had
sushi last me for dinner so I don't know
maybe I really hope it was i hope i
don't have the flu or something like
that god forbid like i did not have time
for that but um I think maybe it's just
my head cold coming back I don't know
what the whole vomiting situation is but
anyway um I went into the beauty room
and try to fill this video and I was
just like no it's not happening there's
like you know snot running out of my
nose and with like the harsh lighting I
was like sweating and I just not looking
so cute and I just feel like this would
be more comfortable for me so I hope you
don't mind i'm sorry i know i posted a
video filming on this particular what is
this camera laptop yesterday but i will
be back to filming like my reviews on my
good camera in my beauty room tomorrow
so i will be doing neill laura geller
cushion bronzer i also be doing the new
laura mercier I posted on my Instagram
this gorgeous picture oh my god the
laura mercier of highlighters i got
three of the new like limited edition
shades and then also i'm going to be
reviewing all of the new Nick's palettes
that came out I picked all four of those
up so those will be up tomorrow I
normally feel a lot better in the
morning so hopefully tomorrow morning
you'll feel better keep your fingers
crossed that it's just a cold again but
my god I've had a call for like four
months now anyway let's just get right
into this video um the reason that I
feel like I can film this video because
I'm just showing you guys like products
by the way I'm in Tom's office if you're
curious but the reason I feel like I can
film this video's just because I'm not
showing you guys it doesn't need to be
anything like fancy clothes up you know
like makeup I
I'm literally just sewing showing you
the outside packaging of my favorite
hair care products that are under ten
dollars so let's just get right into it
the first thing I want to talk about is
the Pantene still p booster with you
have probably seen this in like my fails
and holy grails it's never a fail it's
always the Holy Grail I get this for i
think around three dollars and
forty-nine cents at target it smells
really really good now i have heard that
Pantene leaves like a waxy buildup in
the hair that can cause breakage I feel
like it's only for certain hair types
because my friend literally like her
hair broke off with Pantene whereas mine
I've been using the stuff for like eight
years and I've never had any issue so I
feel like maybe if you have fine here
you're okay but she had really coarse
curly hair and her hair really did break
off so I don't know I just wanted to put
that out there maybe stay away from the
panty products if you of course dry hair
but this is a really nice product like I
said it's like 349 it literally comes
out like a shaving cream and it's very
very moisturizing it smells amazing cook
with Pantene and I feel like it's just
really nice at the leave-in conditioner
i put it from my earlobe down to my ends
and i feel like it moisturizes my hair
it makes it look shiny and soft and
beautiful so that is the first product
yes I'm dad a little walk on dad alright
the next product I want to talk about is
literally like right under ten dollars
this is the program acts of all Yuma
boost route no no root most finish a
bodybuilder this is the only like roots
pray that does and have sea salt or like
texture in it this will not leave your
hair crunchy if you have fine here and
you don't want your boost to feel like
crunchy and gross you need this in your
life I spray it on before I blow dry my
hair which is like never um but even
when I just have damp here I'll put it
on my roots love it it will give you
really really nice like natural volume
and I just I love this product you can
get that at Ulta but i believe it's like
fourteen dollars and also i got mine on
eBay alright the next product I want to
talk about is from oh gx so this is the
Sunkist blonde lemon highlights
highlight activating citrus oil mist I
don't know if this actually like
activates any highlights in my hair but
this is a beautiful glossing missed if
you want to make your hair look really
shiny and healthy I highly recommend
checking this out it has coconut oil and
key lime and it smells amazing and
honestly I'm a huge fan of the oh gx
brand I feel
it's kind of like panting it either
works for you or it doesn't this brand
works for me and I'm a big fan of their
products so this is definitely one of my
favorite items the next item I want to
talk about it from a Johnson like baby
baby shampoo staff this would be no more
tangles detangling spray this is
probably the best detangler out of all
of them that I have tried it says its
styles while unlocking stubborn tangles
and it's for little babies so I don't
feel like I'm tugging at my hair I have
beat Anglia's hair ever you guys like
literally my hair just like knots up the
second like it hits water it not sup so
I personally really really like this one
and you can get it in your eyes and it
won't make it right alright moving on
the next thing I want to talk about is
from John Frieda this has a very bad rep
and i want to say if you have damaged
hair do not attempt to use this ok this
is the John Frieda sheer blonde go
blonder controlled lightning spray this
has peroxide in it it's got a little bit
of bleach in there I believe do not use
this okay if you have like dry damaged
hair just do not use it I have somewhat
still kind of health I mean I'm home
like third day here right now so it
looks a little horrible but I am pretty
somewhat healthy hair still even though
i do bleach it I only spray this on my
roots if I spray this on my ends when I
get out of the shower I swear to you
like I wake up with deep driest hair in
the morning like disgusting like
disgusting dry just like breaking off
dry so i highly recommend if you do have
blonde hair you have like fine hair or
healthy hair and you want to touch up
like your routes between you know
styling sessions like I really need to
get my roots done it's a big issue if
you have blonde hair so i highly
recommend but if you have dry hair like
stay away from this dry and damaged hair
straight stay up way alright the next
product I want to talk about is the only
mass that I will be mentioning and you
guys know I'm obsessed with air mass I
use these as my conditioners and I've
recently discovered this one this is the
Garnier whole blends nourishing mass
this is the avocado one my friend
Tiffany said it smells like babies and
like perfume or something that's exactly
what it smells like it's a very
comforting scent I do not have a baby
but it is a very comforting sense it has
a beautiful beautiful formulation I feel
like it really helps with the tangled in
my hair it just loosens them up
immediately so I can comb
you like my hair in the shower which is
amazing and then I don't feel like I
have to use this much detangle it when I
get out and on top of that i can use it
on my roots it doesn't wait on my hair
it with me just like revitalizes it it's
strengthens it it moisturizes it this is
my new favorite hair mask and I know I
say that a lot you guys if you've seen
my empties videos I will literally go
through so many hair mask but this is
this is the new favorite k so this is
the only one holy grail alright moving
on let's talk about my favorite dry
shampoo this is the suave professionals
keratin infusion salon proven dry
shampoo I want to say I would really
like to include also the what is it be
keratin infusion shampoo in this video
as well however I don't have a container
of it anymore so I'm including my second
favorite kind of shampoo but you guys
literally the best shampoo ever is the
suave professionals 1 i've never used
such a good shampoo that doesn't strip
my color it lathers really nicely it
smells amazing leave my hair so silky
highly recommend but anyway the suave
professionals line is really really
great I think this is under four dollars
that target and this is just great I
honestly I mean I don't have dark hair
so I don't know if it leaves a bit of a
white cast or not but I just like to
spray this on my hair I like to wear it
um I like to wear it I like to have it
in my hair when I'm wearing my hair down
because I don't feel like it has any
texture or like um styling properties if
that makes sense every time I wear my
hair up I he's kind of like a two in one
product that's like a dry shampoo +
hairspray in one so that my hair doesn't
start falling out um but when I wear it
down I just want it to look nice and
sleek and I just love this product it
makes no built up or like weirdness in
your hair you how sometimes you use
those dry shampoos and you just feel
like you put like cornstarch on your
scalp like this doesn't do that it's
beautiful and it really does make your
hair look like it was just washed all
right moving on like i said if i had it
i would talk about the suave
professionals um is it salon proven i
think it's the color care shampoo best i
have ever tried best one but this is my
second favorite again oh GX is just a
really good brand for me you can get
this little travel-size for 299 at Ulta
or
full-size for under ten dollars i think
on ebay so this is the renewing argan
oil of Morocco shampoo I also really
enjoyed the oil that comes from this
particular like renewing our vows oil of
Morocco line and you would think like
argon oil I could just use like my josie
maran argan oil no no I swear to you
there's something else in here because
this argan oil never leaves my hair
gross and then argan oil like in here
never leaves my hair feeling greasy or
anything like that I can literally take
the matching oil that goes with this
products and I can put it on my roots
and it will not live oily so I really
really like this if you have very very
fine hair and you want something that
will nourish your hair is a wonderful
shampoo that also ladders up really
beautifully it just yeah I don't know I
feel like for fine hair like literally
being able to put oils on your scalp
like that the whole new thing like a
whole new world ok I mean that's really
really awesome so yeah I highly
recommend checking out just I guess just
in general the oh gx renewing our vows
oil of Morocco shampoo conditioner and
also hair oil but I just included this
one in here alright moving on the next
product I want to talk about if you have
dry brittle blonde hair like me now
here's not severely dry but it is
getting there because while I bleach the
hell out of it now pretty much every six
weeks so this is the German distinctions
silver brightening miracle leave-in
conditioning treatment it is a five and
one for all shades of silver grey and
blonde hair do you see that right there
it's got a purple tint to it you know
what that means if you have blonde hair
and you pull like golden tones instead
of like nice like Elsa hair you don't
want to be in like that gorgeous
gorgeous kind of silver tone like nobody
actually pulls that color let's be
honest um this will help you because it
actually tones your hair it moisturizes
your hair at conditions it softens it
brightens it adds shine it's like
amazing and it kinda reminds me of the
eight to ten however this is literally
399 at bed bath and beyond and on top of
that it is a thinner consistency like
it's literally like a water so if you do
have fine hair and you don't want to
just like put you know I personally
can't use the it's a 10 like all over
like my root area i kind of just
concentrate it from like my earlobe down
this product i can spray everywhere and
I love it tones my hair moisturizes it
right alright and then the last product
is the last one one two three four five
six seven eight nine ten okay I felt
like this one so quickly even though
love them enough long anyway this is the
Shea Moisture african black soap dry
scalp elixir I get this on eBay I've
never had any issues with Oregon on eBay
this has tea tree oil and willow bark
extract which is just a fancy word for
salicylic acid this is her dry itchy
scalp dandruff eczema and psoriasis
anytime I get a lupus flare-up I'm
telling you I get this big open sores on
my scalp and the itch like hell like
it's like hell to the point where I itch
and itch and tell it's gabs over and
then it bleeds and then it's just a hot
bath this is like my little Savior you
guys can see i have used pretty much
like half a bottle up i love this i will
literally just take it and spray right
onto the area you massage it in it feels
really nice because you have tea tree
like tea tree oil in there so if you
have dry scalp if you deal with like
psoriasis or if you have like a
lupus-like me and you just get some like
gross welts on your scalp once in a
while this is amazing it really really
is nice it feels good because when you
have like scabs and like stuff going on
on your scalp you just naturally want to
kick I get really upset that I just want
to like pick at them and I feel like
this is really cooling and it just feels
nice because you are supposed to rub it
and massage it into the scalp so you get
the feeling of kind of itching without
doing damage so I personally really
really enjoyed this product again not
for everybody it's just for people who
have like dry scalp and also if you do
deal with psoriasis eczema or you know
whatever on your scalp but yeah highly
recommend the product I cannot be
without alright guys those are my top 10
hair products under ten dollars I'm
feeling relatively good right now so i
hope to see you guys tomorrow I'm sure I
will I don't know what happened but I
hope you guys can understand why I
decided to just film in Tom's office
with my nice little soft lady here um it
just was too much under the lighting and
all that kind of stuff so I apologize
and I only got one video up to date but
uh I'm happy to see you guys and I will
see you tomorrow I promise hopefully see
you then okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
