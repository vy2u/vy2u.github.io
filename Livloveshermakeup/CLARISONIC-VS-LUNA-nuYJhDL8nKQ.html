wanted to jump on here really quick and
give you guys a quick comparison on the
Clarisonic versus the Luna if you guys
didn't know I did purchase the Luna
during the vib Rouge event that happened
in November and I wanted to give you
guys my thoughts on these devices which
one I prefer which one I think you
should pick up things like that so let's
go ahead and get started
I have two different Clara Sonic's here
to talk about one of them is Tom's this
is the Clarisonic Aria and then I have
mine which is the Clarisonic Mia so let
me give you a little bit of background
information on my Clarisonic experience
I have in purchasing Clarisonic cents
and they released the first model that I
had was a Clarisonic Pro which had about
five different settings speed settings
on it and the original brush head that I
had used was just the normal version
they hadn't released all the new brush
heads yet today now do you have a
sensitive skin version they have a
blemish skin version if they have the
lux brushes which is what Tom and I use
they have plenty of different brushes
that you can choose from so when I first
started using it I noticed a huge
difference in my skin and I will say
right off the bat I still do prefer my
Clarisonic over the Luna this is the
clarisonic mia so like I said I've had
an aria Tom also does have an aria I've
had a pro and then I've had the Mia and
also the Mia - I think all of them work
pretty much identically it just depends
on if you want different speed settings
this one only has the one kind of speed
setting at the Clarisonic Aria I think
has like three or four and then like I
said the pro has about five I don't
think there's that big of a difference
between the speed settings based on what
it does for your skin I think it will
just exfoliate or clean your skin faster
if you want a higher speed setting now
as far as the luna is concerned I got
the Luna mini they do have quite a few
different versions they have the Luna
mini they have a sensitive skin version
which is probably what I should have
picked up they do have a men's version
and then they also do have like a normal
version for normal skin so the reason
why i say that i should have picked up a
sensitive version is because i actually
find this small device to be quite
abrasive on the skin what it is is
basically these little silicone like
nubs as you can see i was calling these
nipples both of you guys know what I did
they're basically these little cleansing
nubs and you have basically two
different settings on here that you can
put it on so this is the first one and
then they do have like a lower setting
also
so you can use this part back here which
is a little more scratchy and a little
bigger you can use this on your body on
your neck they do have a special setting
for your neck on this particular device
and then the smaller ones this is really
nice around like your t-zone and just
like the areas around your face so I do
find that this is a little more abrasive
than say my Clarisonic now the reason
why I say that is because I do use the
luxe of brush heads on the Clarisonic so
the luxe of brush heads on the
Clarisonic look a little something like
this just the standard kind of brush
head however when you actually look at
the brush head up close you can see that
it has like a lot of give to it it's
very soft it's very silky and if you
have never tried the luxe brush heads or
the cashmere brush heads from Clarisonic
then you probably do think that this is
just as abrasive as the regular brush
heads are because the irregular brush
heads with the Clarisonic in my opinion
are very abrasive especially the normal
skin version even the sensitive skin
version especially the deep pore
cleansing version they are quite
abrasive but this brush it is just so
soft and silky that I really cannot
compare I cannot find anything cleansing
wise it is as soft as silky as a
cashmere brush head so compared to the
luna I will say or yeah the luna easy
obviously the loonie compared to the
luna I do think that this one is a lot
less abrasive on the skin it gives a
really nice foamy lather and it's just
overall beautiful so if you do want to
purchase the Aria this is gonna be more
than the luna for a out mini they do
have different models on the luna like I
said they range from $99 all the way up
to like 150 and that's the same with the
Clarisonic this little guy here my pink
guy is around $99 and then you can range
all the way up to one hundred one
hundred fifty hundred sixty so I think
that if you are looking into the foreo
luna i would highly recommend starting
with the sensitive skin version just
because although it looks like it
wouldn't be too abrasive I do find that
it really does stimulate the skin and
that is the biggest difference between
the Clarisonic and the luna in my
opinion I find that the Clarisonic
really really cleanses my skin very very
nicely whereas the luna stimulates it so
I like to use this in the morning I know
a lot of people use this to remove
makeup at nighttime that did not work
for me whatsoever my favorite way to
remove makeup is just with an oil and
then I go in and I double cleanse I
don't like to use my Clarisonic for
removing my makeup either because they
do find that the brush head starts to
get soaked up with lots of makeup and
just gross grimy
so I don't use my Clarisonic to actually
remove my makeup or any cleansing device
to remove my makeup I specifically
double cleanse and then I used this with
my cleanser in the shower so I like to
use my Clarisonic at nighttime and I
like to use the Luna in the mini Luna in
the morning I feel like the Luna
stimulates a blood flow which is great
in the morning especially if your face
is a little more on the puppy side so
you basically just massage it in I would
not recommend using this with a scrub or
any kind of really really abrasive you
know benzyl aprox like glycolic acid
salicylic acid kind of a cleanser I
would highly recommend just using it
with a very very basic cleanser because
it really is going to massage into your
skin and get the blood flow going it
definitely does exfoliate the squid
since the skin the squid the skin quite
nicely just like the Clarisonic but I
think the overall cleansing experience
wise I still do prefer the Clarisonic so
if you do have very congested skin like
I do and you're a little more
combination to oily skin you have more
congestion in your skin and you want to
clear out your pores I would actually
recommend picking up both you definitely
can get the Clarisonic Mia for around
$99 with two brush heads and I believe
like two different cleansers right now
they have like a set online on Sephora
that's a really really good deal you
don't need like the pro version or even
the Aria Tom's like I love my Aria I'm
like this one's just as good trust me
I've gone through so many different
models and then the foreo you also can
get the little mini version they have
like a battery-powered one that
definitely I believe it dies after about
a month or two but it's a nice way to
try the device out you can get that for
around 30 or 40 dollars with like a
little set so great way to try it out if
you do have very sensitive skin I would
just recommend getting the Clarisonic
with a cashmere brush head if you have
very mature or dry skin again I would
recommend either getting the sensitive
version of the foreo or again just a
Clarisonic with the cashmere brush head
if you have combo to oily skin I think
you could use both I think this is great
for you know getting your skin going in
the morning just kind of getting the
blood flow pumping and this is great for
cleansing your skin this is gonna help
more with acne and breakouts in my
opinion and this is just more for
helping with anti-aging so I really do
think they do different things it just
depends on what kind of skin type you
have so as far as like charging is
concerned you really this is great for
travel this is what I'm gonna take for
traveling for Christmas because you do
not you only have to charge this like
once every five
and it's very easy to charge overnight
so that's awesome with the Clarisonic
you have to be charging this probably
two or three times a week
this really dies quickly even if you do
have the Aria or the pro-ice where all
of them die pretty darn quickly
especially if you're using it everyday
even twice a day so yeah I would say for
travel wise I would definitely go with
the Luna um but yeah I think they're
both really fantastic I honestly do I
still do prefer my Clarisonic over this
guy just because I am very very I feel
like I'm biased I love my Clarisonic
I've been using my Clarisonic for years
now and I do think overall it has
changed my skin as far as breakouts and
congestion are concerned this little guy
just does a different kind of things so
if you want more like a brighter skin
less fine lines and wrinkles I think
this is a good option for you one thing
I will say about this is it's a very
hard to get around like the t-zone and
around like your eye area but the
Clarisonic has the same issue sometimes
you know it's hard to get around certain
areas on your face so anyway I hope that
this little quick comparison video was
somewhat helpful to you guys thank you
so much for joining me and I will see
you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
