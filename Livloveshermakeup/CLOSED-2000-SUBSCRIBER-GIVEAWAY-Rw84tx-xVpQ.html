channel thank you so much for joining me
I am a little under the weather again
today I don't know quite what happened
but I woke up and my cold was basically
back so I'm going to be filming this
just pointing the camera down I'm still
in my pjs I just don't feel really good
today so I'm sorry that my face is not
on camera but I wanted to do this video
this is going to be a 2,000 subscriber
giveaway um thank you so much I can't
even tell you guys how much that means
to me I hit 2000 last week and I think
now I'm almost at 2000 like 100 or
something like that I am very very like
I jumped in other hundred subscribers in
a week it's amazing and as promised i
told you guys everythin till five
thousand i will do a giveaway for you
guys my last giveaway i went to one of
my really closest subscribers i want to
say I'm she was one of my first
subscribers I was so happy it was her
when I do these i do do them through
rafflecopter so everything is basically
like picked by a computer I I don't have
any say in it I just tell you guys what
you know to write in the comments
section and then all of you are entered
so it has nothing to do with me just so
you guys know but it was really really
fun for me that Claudia I want for her
last name but that Claudia one because I
love her so much she's so sweet she
always comments and she was one of my
first subscribers it meant the world to
me so she won the kat von d contouring
palette and also the makeup forever what
was it eyeshadow palette yes and I
thought this time it would be fun
because a lot of people were saying oh I
wish there was more than one winner so
this time i am doing two winners and i'm
doing the same kind of thing so we've
got an eye palette and instead of a
cheek palette i'm doing an eye palette
and a little lip set fruit the two
winners so one is going to be a very
very bright like someone's going to win
a very bright kit so the first thing
you're going to win if you get this
little bright kit is the Stila eternal
love liquid lipstick set these are all
products by the way that our holiday
related and the reason I'm doing that is
because I've been reviewing so many of
them and these are kind
of my favorite ones that I've reviewed
so far and I just thought it would be
fun since it is holiday time and it just
so happened that I hits you know 2,000
around the holidays that it would be fun
to give you guys some of the treats that
I have been reviewing so I will put my
reviews and swatches of all these
products in the downbar below so if you
are interested in going and looking to
see you know what they look like
swatched and what the actual pallets
look like you can go and check that out
but the person who's going to win the
bright kit over here is going to win the
Stila eternal love liquid lipstick set I
love this little lipstick set it's
amazing i love these colors they're very
poppy like you get a really bright red
bossy or beso and then you get um I
think this one's bossy now this one's
Rico and this one's bossy huh I'm
confusing them but I have been wearing
this little set for the past two weeks
actually on my lips so you get kind of a
neutral one a bright red and then a deep
deep color and then for the person who's
going to be winning the bright palette I
decide to get you the place for this is
an awesome palette I was having such a
hard time deciding between this and the
lorac pro 2 they are the same price and
I just was like oh my god I cannot
decide it cannot decide but I decide to
stick with the theme of kind of you know
this will be the neutral winner and then
this will be the kind of bright winner
that sounds so weird the person who wins
the neutral the neutral kit and then the
person who wins the brighter stuff so
anyway so I did get the advice for for
whoever's going to win that so I feel
like this Stila liquid lipstick set and
the Vice for will go really well
together there's a lot of jewel tones in
here and if you want to see all the
swatches of what the palette looks like
i will obviously link that below like i
said and then for the person who is
going to win the neutral kit um you are
going to win the lip kit that you're
going to get is the two face Lou petites
place or you get three full-size la
creme lipsticks in here and I feel like
two of the colors in here are very very
like neutral and even the one that says
wham like that really really bright one
is not too bright like all of them are
pretty neutral and nice and it comes in
this cute little bag and I just thought
this would be great for someone who you
know whoever gets like the neutral
little kids would really probably like
this a lot and then
and for the eye palette this is actually
the Stila trust and love gift set and I
reviewed this really really love this
too there are like I think 16 eyeshadows
in here that are so beautiful very very
neutral absolutely gorgeous and stunning
however you do also get like a deluxe
eyes mascara in here and also a lip
glaze so I thought that it kind of
evened out because this one is twenty
dollars cheaper than the advice for I
felt like you got extra stuff in here so
you do get to the mascara and you also
get the other little lip products so I
tried to keep them as close in price as
I could I believe this one went over by
maybe ten dollars but in all in all I
tried to keep them close in price to
that they were basically like winning
the same amount of staff and honestly I
can't pick any of these over the other
all of them are fantastic and I just
kind of wanted to coat them together
like colorful and neutral and I hope
people I'd like that so um two of you
will be winning one of you look at the
neutral one of you will get the colorful
and all I want you guys to do is you
don't have to be subscribed to my
channel you don't have two thumbs up the
video all I want is for you to tell me
what is your favorite season and why and
like I told you guys this goes through
rafflecopter I have no say in who
actually wins it is a complete crap
shoot so I hope you guys enjoy entering
thank you so much for being my
subscribers and I will see you guys in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
