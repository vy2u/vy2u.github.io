follow-up reviews those will be really
lightning fast anyway but I am going to
start with the giveaway portion so yes I

have exceeded seven thousand which is
just amazing thank you so much to
everybody who is subscribed to my

love interacting with you guys I really
do appreciate your love and support and
I will be doing another giveaway when I
hit 10,000 subscribers but anyway I just
want to go over like the rules and

giveaways through rafflecopter if you
guys are curious so it's completely like
blind I don't even see it they pick for
me basically a computer or robot picks
for me and then I go ahead and announce
the winner exactly a week from today so
exactly a week from today I think I have
a video going up called highlighters her
fair skin or something like that I will
announce the winner of the giveaway in
that video as well and I'll do it before
the video so you guys don't have to hang
around for the whole thing but anyway
let's go ahead and just get into the
prices for the giveaway so the first
prize is the Urban Decay afterglow
eight-hour powder highlighter in the
shade sin I really love these eight hour
powder highlighters from urban decay I
really wanted to get aura but then I
thought you know what I don't know who's
gonna win the giveaway I don't know what
kind of like skin tone they're gonna
have things like that so I thought sin
was really good it's a beautiful sort of
champagne color that I think would be
flattering on all sorts of different
skin tones the second item that somebody
is going to win is the tortise or
tortoise blush palette this is a blush
palette that I really really love I
think it's absolutely beautiful and
I'm more than happy to give this away to
one of you also i want to say really
quickly all of my giveaways are open to
everyone so if you live overseas don't
worry you can absolutely enter my
giveaways all right and then the last
item that i am giving away is the alice
through the looking glass palette i
really really love this palette and
originally I got you guys the two-faced
sweet peach palette and unfortunately it
came completely shattered and I've tried
to go and exchange it and that's the
reason this giveaway took so long for me
to actually get up on my channel it's
because I was trying to find a way to
exchange that palette but I was not able
to find a new one so i just got store
credit for it and instead i got you guys
the alice through the looking glass
palette which i really really love I did
pick this up myself and I do actually
really adore it so anyway that is what
that palette looks like so yeah one of
you will win the tart is the blush
palette the alice through the looking
glass palette and also the eight-hour
powder highlighter i think that that's
just a nice array of products to get a
nice shadow palette a blush palette and
then a highlight so i hope you guys
enjoy it like i said all you have to do
is just enter down below and just they
enter me and I won't be doing this on
Instagram or anything it will just be my
YouTube page so yeah just entered on
blue all right now let's go ahead and
get into the first impressions follow up
segment of this video so the first first
impressions is the morphe concealer so
this is the follow up review on these so
i did an original video on these where i
did a first impressions video and my
thoughts are pretty much the same on
them i think they are really really well
priced however i think that they pull a
lot of like peachy and Sam any sort of
colors so they're really really nice
underneath the eye area by the way the
shades i have our bare skin and khaki
khaki is a little more pink toned and
bare skin is a little more neutral i
think they are really really lovely i
just think they're better for underneath
the eyes that that makes sense I do
notice if I put these on blemishes or
anywhere else that I want to cover they
do start to crease and they just are not
really that great of as far as like
covering up pimples and acne scarring
but they're really really nice to meet
the eyes I do like the consistency it's
sort of ice almost like foamy and so
it's really hard to explain it's kind of
like a sony sort of texture in the sense
that it's super super creamy and the
sack
you start blending it and it just
completely adheres to your skin which I
actually think is really really nice so
I do like them for underneath the eye
are they my favorite concealers of all
time absolutely not but they were really
really cheap about four or five dollars
so i give these about four stars alright
the next item that i have a quick little
first impressions follow up review on is
the illamasqua beyond powder highlight
in the shade oh my god i am loving this
i think this is a beautiful beautiful
highlight its really really light on the
skin and i don't mean like pigmentation
light I mean the actual consistency is
like so light it just feels like nothing
is there on the skin so I really like it
i think it's going to be beautiful to
wear during the summer time and I really
have nothing bad to say about this I
think it's absolutely beautiful and then
they last item that I have a first
impressions follow up review on for you
guys is the Revlon eyes cheeks plus lips
palette this was a disaster it's um it's
still a disaster I really don't like
this palette first of all I don't like
that you have cream products with powder
products without having a little flap
over them to completely protect the
product all of the powder products get
into the lip products which are cream I
don't like the pigmentation on this I
don't like the blend ability this is
extremely expensive not worth it in my
opinion you guys will be seeing this in
my declutter series in the fall so
anyway those are my little first
impressions follow-up reviews and also
my 7000 subscriber giveaway thank you so
much to everyone who loves and supports
my channel I really really do appreciate
you guys and I will see you guys
tomorrow but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
