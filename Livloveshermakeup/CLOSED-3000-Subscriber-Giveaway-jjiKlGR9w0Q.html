thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having an awesome day i am
filming my 3000 subscriber giveaway for
you guys today and I know sometimes I
just don't go on camera to film these
it's just easier and quicker to do it
this way and I don't think there's any
need for me to like show my face on
camera to show you guys what you're
going to get but yes I hit 3000
subscribers which is crazy because I
literally just hit 2000 about three
weeks ago so another thousand subbies in
a month or so I'm well yeah less than a
month thank you so much you guys it
means the world to me i really
appreciate and love every single one of
you and of course if you are new to my
channel i just want to let you guys know
i am doing a you know give away every a
thousand every thousand subscribers
until i hit 5000 and then after 5,000
i'm not quite sure if i'm going to do
every 2,000 or every 5,000 we'll just
have to see um you know how my channel
is growing you know i don't want to have
to be posting a i mean i think you guys
can understand i don't want to have to
be posting a giveaway like every two
weeks or something because then i'm
gonna go broke but you guys know what I
mean so anyway um we will see when we
get there but I wanted to show you guys
what um you will win this time I don't
have a lot of like channel rules on my
giveaways you do not need to be
subscribed to me you don't need to
thumbs up this video or anything i'm not
into shopping for subscribers the only
thing that i want you to do is just
leave me a comment below and tell me
what is your favorite holiday food i was
going to say what is your favorite hot
like christmas food but honestly
everybody celebrates different holidays
of course so just tell me below what is
your favorite holiday food and you could
be in the running to win this so the
first giveaway I ever did I gave away a
contouring palette in an eyeshadow
palette for my two thousand subscriber
giveaway it gave away two eyeshadow
palettes and two lip kits to two
different people and then this time I
thought I would basically put together
like a full face for one lucky winner so
the first thing you're going to be
winning is the tart high-performance
naturals this is the bling it on tarts
holidays what is it called bling it on
Amazonian clay blush palette this is
their limited edition blush palette that
has recently launched this year it is
right over here um I just want to show
you guys what it looks like but you get
for matte shades in one gorgeous kind of
shimmery
shade and I think that you guys will
really really like this I hope whoever
wins it really really likes it it's a
beautiful beautiful blush palette and it
is limited edition but I thought you
guys would probably really like that the
second thing the lucky winner will win
is an eyeshadow palette from ciate this
is the olivia palermo collaboration i
did a review on this as well everything
has been reviewed just you guys know i
like to give away products that I you
know enjoy and have reviewed but this is
the smoldering eye shadow palette and it
looks a little something like this I
think this is a gorgeous gorgeous
palette as you can see it is quite small
and compact but the actual shadow sizes
like the pan size is really really big
I'm sorry I hope I'm not making you guys
dizzy yeah I don't really have a study
and when it comes to my camera but I
think this is a gorgeous palette and i
think that the shades are so nice for
winter and fall and that anybody can
wear those so that is the eyeshadow
palette that they will win and then I
don't have this in front of me but this
is the bite Beauty Best Buy rewind kit
you get these beautiful lip plans
basically and there's kind of a nude
shade of pinky shade of red shade and a
berry shade and I love it it comes in
this little tin I won't open it or
anything but it comes in this little red
tin right there and it's really cute got
a mirror and everything so I thought
this time it would be fun to kind of put
together a whole face for someone to win
so you have your blush you have your
eyeshadow and you have your lip stuff so
anyway like I said all you have to do is
just leave me a comment below tell me
what your favorite holiday food is and
this is international by the way I keep
forgetting to mention that in my um you
know in my giveaways yes this is
international so all you have to do is
just leave me a comment below telling me
your favorite holiday food and I
appreciate you guys thanks so much thank
you so much and yeah I will see you guys
in my video tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
