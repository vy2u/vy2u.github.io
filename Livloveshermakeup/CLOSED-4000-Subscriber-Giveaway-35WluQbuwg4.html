the Too Faced chocolate bon bons palette
and I recently reviewed this I really
really loved it I think it's a fantastic
little palette you get a lot of gorgeous
eyeshadows in here they smell like
chocolate everything is just really good
with this palette so this is what mine
looks like really really cute packaging
and I thought especially since
valentine's Day is coming up I thought
this would be extra extra cute just some
gorgeous gorgeous shades in here and I
feel like somebody would really really
enjoy winning this palette so that is
the first thing the second thing that
the winner is going to get is the new I
was gonna see the new it is kind of new
the tart tease contour palette from
Tarte I reviewed this I love it it is
absolutely beautiful I know that this
will work for anybody's skin tone
whether you're really fair medium skin
deep skin whoever wins there they're
going to be able to use this it's
fantastic has a blush in it it's got
correcting shades it's got um a flat
contour shade and deeper one's got a
blush it's got literally everything in
it so that is the second thing they will
win let me show you guys what mine looks
like this is what it looks like super
super cute i love this little palette it
is amazing i could open it there we go
so this is what it looks like um you get
that deeper contour shade you get a
lighter one you get a blush you get some
correcting shades you get a highlight
you get absolutely everything in here
and I think that's again someone would
really really enjoy winning that and it
also smells like chocolate they totally
happen to face it smells like chocolate
so good alright and then the last thing
um that the lucky winner will win is the
bite Beauty agave lip mask and I thought

the way this is international I'm sorry
I always forget to announce that in my
videos this is international so please
enter if you are across these yes please
do but anyway here in a mirror
right now it is winter and this is just
a fantastic fantastic lip mask it's
super thick I have mine for like two
years and I barely have put a dent in it
like I have so much more product in here
it smells really good it tastes really
good I'm a flute player so you know that
I'm very very picky when it comes to lip
products and this stuff is super
hydrating it's amazing i absolutely love
it so i thought that it would be fun to
