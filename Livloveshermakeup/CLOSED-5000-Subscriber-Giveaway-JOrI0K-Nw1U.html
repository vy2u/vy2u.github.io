please excuse the lack of makeup and the
stringy hair I took a poor yoga class
with my mom this morning and select the
lower all over like sweat everywhere so
I feel like my hair was really streaming
gross now but I am here to share my 5000
subscribe or give away and I just want
to say thank you to all of the new
subscribers this is coming a little
later than what I normally do I have
been doing a giveaway every thousand
subscribers all the way up to 5,000 and
then I decided I was either going to do
when I hit 5000 go every 5000 or go
every 2,000 and I decided to go every
2,000 so the next giveaway that will
happen after this one will be when I hit
seven thousand subscribers and i'm
already at 5,700 right now i believe so
we are closer to six thousand than 5,000
so hopefully that will be soon when we
hit seven devon and then I can help
another giveaway because I love giving
you guys stuff I just loved feeling like
I'm just one of those people um but
anyway I just wanted to say really
quickly I'm like just get it out there I
don't have any rules or regulations on
my channel when it comes to my giveaways
and I have had a few of my subscribers
approach me and say you know that's not
very fair because anybody can enter and
you know whatever this is what I want to
say about it I am NOT interested for my
channel personally I am NOT interested
in asking people to like or follow or do
any of that kind of stuff if they're
just going to end up leaving in the end
what matters more to me on youtube is
subscribers and people not so much of
use that that's never been the reason
why I've been on YouTube it's really
just about like family and community if
that makes sense so I really want royal
subscribers I want people who are there
so I apologize if you are one of my
subscribers and you feel like this is
not fair that I don't have any rules and
regulations I just don't think it's
right for me first of all to tell people
you know to be able to do something you
have to you know follow me here and do
this and do that it's like I just I'm
not really into that it's not really my
style and then on top of that I'm just
interested in loyal subscribers and I
don't want to buy subscribers or have
them for a small amount of time and then
have them leave after so that is why I
do my giveaways that way if you guys are
curious but anyway
did want to say that right away because
I really don't have any rules or
regulations when it comes to my favorite
ways you can enter no matter who you are
you do not need to be subscribed you
don't need two thumbs up the video you
don't need to you know follow me on
twitter facebook or instagram anything
like that all i want to do is go ahead
and leave me a comment down below and
say enter me this is a international
giveaway and i would really like if you
guys just entered once i know some of
you won't and you'll probably enter
multiple times i would still go ahead
and put you in but i will only put you
in what so no matter how many times you
enter i'm really gonna try and keep it
super super fair and put everyone in
once because i think in a few giveaways
that I've done there have been people
that I entered by accident with multiple
times so I'm not going to do that this
time if you're really really good and I
am really going to narrow it down I'm
going to look at every single comments
and you will only be entered once even
if you leave multiple multiple comments
um and yeah I think that's all I really
want to say thank you so much to
everybody who subscribed I really really
love you guys I appreciate it that is
what I love about YouTube is the
community and talking with you guys and
all that kind of stuff so let me show
you guys what I got you so the first
thing that I have for my 5000
subscribers giveaway I feel like my
voice is there no yeah all right 5000
subscriber giveaway I can talk this is
the two based peanut butter palette yay
i love this i reviewed this it's amazing
it's a beautiful beautiful eye shadow
palette i was having a hard time
debating between this one and the tart
rainforest of the sea but i went with
this one it's beautiful I feel like
everybody can use it it's adorable break
packaging right formula that is the
first prize the second prize is
something what the second and third
prizes actually I must say um I returned
to the first tube that I got so I have
gotten the torch color protein wipeout
color correcting palette and also the
highlighting palette and I just wasn't
happy with those purchases I feel like
with the torch 2016 spring collection
and if you're wondering why I've waited
so long for this giveaway it's because I
was waiting for all of these collections
to release so that I could get you guys
some new stuff but anyway with the tart
collection I feel like the strongest
item
the eyeshadow palette and because I had
already purchased the two-faced one I
was just like yeah I'm not going to do
to eyeshadow palette that's weird I just
not into that I prefer to do like some
kind of cheap products I lip product and
like you know an eyeshadow palette so I
went into sephora and I saw this urban
decay of when stefani blush palette and
I do not like the Gwen Stefani eyeshadow
palette I don't like giving away items
that I have not reviewed that I have not
tested myself however i swatched these
in store they are beautiful and no
matter who wins there is going to be a
shade in here that is going to match you
know someone's skin tone so I think that
that's really really good I feel like
with the highlighting palette you never
know who's going to win because I
personally go through rafflecopter so
it's randomly picked the winner yawns I
feel like the highlighting palette you
know maybe too dark for some people or
too late for others I feel like a blush
palette is one of those things that
everybody can use no matter what your
skin tone or type is so anyway I decided
to pick this up I think it's really
really beautiful I know if you people
have said they're not impressed with
this blush palette but i was when i
swatched it in store so I returned the
highlight the charts highlighting
palette and purchase this and then I
returned the tart color correcting
palette because I was like you know what
no the correctors that have stolen my
heart are these urban decay naked skin
color correcting fluids I know they're
not in Pallet form but if you watched my
color correcting video or my reviews or
my demos on these products like
literally these are my favorite they are
the best they are my favorite they do
come like individually but I went ahead
and purchased all five shades for you
guys they're just so good and I know
that they're going to work for any kind
of skin tone in any kind of skin type
and that's the point like I was thinking
about the tart one and I was like yeah
there's some you know a few of the shape
like the green one the orange one and
the yellow shade and that correcting
palette are kind of like a hit and miss
and I was just kind of like oh I don't
know if they'll work for everybody these
will work for everybody so I went ahead
and picked up yellow I got green I got
lavender I got ink and then I got beach
so yeah those are the three items that i
will be doing the giveaway with i hope
you guys aren't upset that i returned
those tart items i actually ended up
paying more for these items all together
then you know this one and they chart
one so technically it's not like i was
trying
cheap or anything I really just wanted
to give you buy something that would be
universal for everyone no matter who won
and also I wanted to give you guys my
favorites you know what that tart palate
is great to the color correcting palette
the bees are the bomb.com so first item
the Urban Decay color parking fluids all
five shades the Urban Decay when stefani
blush palette which have six blue shades
in it and then the two-faced peanut
butter and jelly time palette alright so
that is it like I said it just go ahead
and leave me a comment I don't know if I
got it yeah leave me a comment down
below the only thing you have to do to
be in this giveaway is they enter me and
like I said please enter once i will
scan you out if you enter multiple times
i will only put you in one so there's no
point in like spamming unless you just
want to waste my time but anyway like I
said it is international I am more than
happy to ship over there you know across
seas and yeah best of luck to everybody
and I will be back in a week and I will
let you guys know who the winner is bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
