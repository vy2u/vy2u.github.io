just because I was I wanted to get a
contour felt that I had used I have
never tried this one however and when I

the one that I really wanted to get

on to the little haul part of this video
I picked up three things at sephora for
myself along with of course those other
two things for you guys but I'm going to
show you guys what I got for myself I
picked up the estee lauder double wear
stay-in-place makeup I've heard so much
about this everybody raves about this
I've never gotten it before and I just
really really like the thought of it
being kind of like really heavy duty
coverage like the kat von d um you know
oops hold on one second oops sorry
something popped up on the screen kind
of mean like the kat von d locket a to
foundation however it is not nearly as
cakey I heard so I can't wait to try
this um the shape that I got was in 11
and 1 i've renewed this was the lightest
shade that they had so hopefully this
will match but i'm going to try that out
the next thing i got was a clinique
cheek pop I don't have any of these I
actually don't know any of these are
just kind of weird because they're so
cute and the one I picked up with an 02
pitch pop so cheap pop in peach bag so
it looks like that and I just thought
this was a really really beautiful color
um it's got like a lot of coral in it
and it's just gorgeous and I thought oh
my gosh I need to have that in my life
so you can really share it out and kind
of have like a little bit of a glow to
it too so really really beautiful and
very very excited for that and then the
last thing I picked up for my little
part of the segment of the hall was the
Lancome blush subtil palette this is
another one of these sculpting and
illuminate
blush and highlighter palettes I have
one of these and I loved it so much that
I had to pick this one up this one is in
think its nectar yeah 126 nectar lace
and you get the contour you get the
highlight and then the blush and the
blush is really why I wanted it cuz it's
just so gosh darn gorgeous it's kind of
similar to the cheek bot um however this
one's just a little bit deeper and it's
got a lot of glow to it and i love the
other um lancome blush palette that I
own so anyway that is what i got from
sephora i picked up those two things for
you guys for the giveaway and then those
three things for me so i hope you guys
enjoyed this i will leave everything
below to enter the giveaway what you
guys need to do and i hope that one of
you is really excited that you get it so
