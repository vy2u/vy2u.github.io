have been really exciting fun little box
here to open with you guys today it is
from colour-pop mmm excuse me this is my
first color pop box ever that i ordered
i wanted to try some of their lippie
stix and also their eyeshadows which
i've heard a lot about so let's just get
started the first thing effect was in
here when i open this was a cute little
color pop thank you note and it says
dear Olivia remember happy girls are the
prettiest Audrey Hepburn told us so xoxo
color pop so I thought that was really
really cute it's just the little things
in life those little things those little
extra touches that make things really
special so I guess let's just get
started with the shadows I got ten of
the super shocked are they called yeah
super shock shadows I got ten of those
and then I got a lippie stix Holiday
Collection box so let's start with the
shadows the first one I got and I did
swatch some of these just so you guys
know the first one I got is in the color
girlie it looks like this it's just this
really beautiful like white color but it
has like a gorgeous gorgeous purpley
blue undertone and it's absolutely
beautiful I love it
also just a heads up I heard that you
really need to make sure that these are
sealed really really tightly after you
open them up because they will dry out
if you don't close them really really
tightly so remember to do that the
second one I got is in the color dare
it's this gorgeous gorgeous purple color
and it has tons and tons of shimmer in
it I hope that's picking up all of its
gorgeousness what I really love about
these shadows is that they seem to have
like the most important undertones like
they have like green and blue and like
the colors and it's just like the
undertone makes up like a huge amount of
the shadow and it's really really
beautiful really really gorgeous
the next color I got is Tea Party and
it's this nice I would call it like a
pinky salmony kind of color and it's
almost like peachy it looks like that
gorgeous the next one I got is a matte
one I believe and it is in the color
mittens and this is like a deep deep
dark brown yeah it's like a deep deep
deep chocolate brown I'd call it with
almost like a reddish undertone to it
it's gorgeous
absolutely gorgeous the next one I got
is this gorgeous mermaid blue color I'm
obsessed with it it is called too shy
and it looks like this oh my god you
guys it is like blue bright mermaid blue
with like purple undertones I hope you
can see that
gorgeous love it love it love it the
next one I got was also a matte one this
is in the color girl crush and this is
kind of like a topi gray color that'd be
really really nice and pretty just like
in the crease for a simple day look love
that and as you can see I already did
dip my fingers into quite a few of these
they just feel so soft and buttery and I
can't wait to start really using them on
my eyes and do some tutorials for you
guys but also get some swatches and a
full on review for you guys going on
that and as you guys can see I'll show
you the next color which is get lucky
which is a gorgeous gorgeous gold color
as you can see they have this like print
on the top and once you rub your finger
in there it kind of starts to wear off
so it gets even creamier as you work
your way into these shadows they really
feel like half moves half powder so it's
just like a gorgeous gorgeous soft
combination so that one was get lucky
which is just that gorgeous gold color
the next one is hanky panky and this one
is also really really beautiful it's
kind of like a matte light brown this
would be a great transition color in my
opinion excited to use that I can't wait
to swatch these guys for you the next
one is one of my favorites it's called
bubbly I already know this is gonna be
like my all-time favorite I think it's
this gorgeous pink color it's just this
light pink and it's beautiful and just
perfect and it's just do you see like
when I turn it you pick up all that
shimmer like that is not the lighting
that is actually like the reflection
like I mean it is like they're so highly
shimmery and gorgeous some of these
so love that one and the last one I got
was just this really really deep dark
reddish brown color this is bandit I
would say that mittens is like dart like
if you compare this one definitely has
more like red Brown to it it kind of
matches my shirt the other one mittens I
know I said that that one was kind of
reddish brown this one is definitely
reddish brown the other one is
definitely more chocolate brown than
this one so those were all ten of those
I'm really excited I will swatch and do
a separate review for you guys on those
and the other thing I got I also wanted
to try some of the lippie stix I've got
to the forget the fruitcake set so
that's what it looks like and I thought
this would be a great way to try out
when you're in here one two three four
five six six of their lippie stix
so they come in that cute little box I
believe this is a Holiday Collection but
let me show you guys the colors you get
if I can get them out of the packaging
that'd be great okay the first one you
get is cookie and that is cookie it's
like this nice like a brownish neutral
color that's very very in right now the
next color is tuxedo which is like a
beautiful pinky fuchsia color kind of
matches my nails which are in Harbor on
this condition I need to repaint them
the next one you get is confetti and
this is a hyper glossy stick it says hmm
so really really nice deep red and then
you get Cheers which is a matte
beautiful deep deep deep like almost
berry color maybe a brown undertone the
next one you get is Lady which is also a
match and this is like a deep plum color
and the last one you get in that set
is to to which is a mat and this is
definitely deep deep deep berry so I'm
really really excited to try those out I
will definitely do a swatches and review
once I ate ride them out more and yeah
so on the back of that it does say I
thought that there was yeah okay so it
says that there are hyper glossies and
also math so it looks like there are one
two three four mats and three two hyper
glasses yeah so formats to hyper
glossies and i think my hyper glossy
finish is just gonna be gorgeous
so anyway that was my first colour-pop
haul I hope you guys enjoyed going
through this box with me like I said

doing a review and swatches on the
lippie stix and also the shadows so
