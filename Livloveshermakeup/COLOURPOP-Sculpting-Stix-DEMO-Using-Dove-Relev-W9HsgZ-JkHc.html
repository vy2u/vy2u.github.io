video is going to be a demo on two of
the new color pops sculpting sticks I
picked up the shade releve which is a
highlight and also double which is a
cream contour so I have already gone
ahead and put my foundation on that it's
my preferred way of putting this
particular you know these particular
products on just realize my hairline
looks a little muddy but anyway I really
like putting these products on over my
foundation because I don't find that
they're super super intensely pigmented
so I was just gonna go ahead and show
you guys how I like to use these and
yeah let's get right into it if you are
curious the foundation that I have on is
the Laura Mercier cantle glow soft - the
luminous foundation in the shade shell
and I put on one even layer of that all
over my face and we are going to go
ahead and apply one side with a damp
miracle complexion sponge from Real
Techniques and then the other side we
will buff in with a dual sided brush
from Tarte just so you guys can see the
difference I think I do prefer the brush
I would say overall I do just because
these aren't super super creamy and
they're also not super pigmented I feel
like sometimes if the sponge is a little
too wet it just kind of takes away from
the product so anyway let's go ahead and
get right into it alright so the first
thing that I am going to do is take dub
which is that contouring shade and I am
just going to go ahead and sculpt out
the areas that I want to sculpt
all right so I'm going to blend one side
and with that little tarts brush like I
said I'm going to be taking the fluffier
side and I'm just going to go ahead and
blend that into circular motions see you
guys can see or in circular motions I do
feel like especially like the denser the
brush of the better so let me flip that
over so you guys can kind of see what it
looks like with the denser side but I
really like the way that it does blend
in with the brush I just feel like when
you do have the damp sponge it can take
a little bit of the product away if that
makes sense
and also it kind of disturbs the
foundation especially if the sponge is
too wet
I have tried these under foundation as
well and just because they are not ultra
pigmented I feel like they're fine for
using over your foundation so that is
what I have been doing so there is the
contour color all blended in not super
super noticeable but you definitely can
see a little bit of definition over
there and we're gonna go in it with the
highlight on that side but first we're
going to take at that damp sponge and go
over here and blend in the cream contour
you guys will see what I mean I feel
like I'm kind of like really balancing
this on my skin for a while for it to
actually blend in and it does eventually
work I mean don't get me wrong but I
think I prefer it with a brush which
normally when I'm contouring especially
if I'm cream contouring I don't I
definitely prefer a damp sponge but I
wanted to show you guys how we did it on
each side I do feel like sometimes I
have to kind of swipe at the product
which is annoying with a Beauty Blender
because you're really supposed to that's
it on your skin so as you can see that
contour shade right there I'm dub is
really really nice if you do have fair
skin I am self tanned right now but I
still feel like that would be really
really nice even if I wasn't and I do
feel like it gives a little bit of you
know dimension to your face you can of
course do whatever you want you can
contour wherever you want but those are
just the areas that I usually like to
hit up all right and now I'm gonna go in
with the shade relevé which is that
highlight and this is definitely the
more like disappointing one out of the
two I would say I don't know I just
don't really like this one personally so
I'm just going and we're just gonna go
ahead I was gonna do a small little
triangle but you know what this product
is very very kind of I don't even know
how to describe it guys it's just kind
of it just blends away this highlight
just blends away and I feel like you
really have to kind of build it up so
just a really kind of putting that on
heavily onto the areas where I do want
to go ahead and highlight wow that was
bad let's try that again okay and then
we're gonna go ahead and blend that it
again on one side I'm going to be using
at that brush so I'm just gonna have
blend in circular motions it definitely
takes it longer with the brush but I
think it's worth it because I feel like
the product is evenly distributed it
doesn't go on to streaky now this
particular highlight and I'll talk about
this in the review you can see that it
does kind of sink into my pores it's not
the greatest thing ever in my opinion I
guess let's do half of my nose at the
brush but yeah I don't know if it's the
formulation or the color that just looks
a little chalky on my skin it is kind of
like a cool toned white color so I don't
know why would look chalky since I do
have cool undertones but it is what it
is alright going back in on the other
side with the damn sponge
again I'm kind of having to swipe here
so that I can really distribute that
product with the sponge now at this
point you could go in and you could do
even more if you wanted to I am not
super super big on really really heavy
contouring that's never been my thing or
really really heavy highlighting but at
this point you could definitely go ahead
and do so I do feel like the layers
build nicely on top of each other so you
don't have to worry about that but what
I like to do at this point is go ahead
and set my foundation in so I'm going to
take my L'Oreal infallible Pro matte
powder with my Tarte err buffer
foundation brush and I'm just going to
swirl that in there and stipple this
onto my face I can set everything in
just because it is cream contour and
that will slip and slide all over my
oily skin
so that is it guys that's personally how
I like to use those I do think that it
blends in a lot nicer with like a you
know dense sort of brush just because it
is sort of a thin like I don't know the
pigmentation is not really super opaque
and creamy so I do prefer that over the
sponge but yeah I think this gives a
really nice sort of natural contouring I
really really like the dove shade I'm
not crazy about the releve shade I don't
really feel like it does much for my
skin again it is a highlighter it's not
supposed to be you know like a concealer
but I just don't feel like it really
brought out the high points with my face
that well so anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed this little demo like I said if
you would like to see a review on these
products then I will go ahead and link
that down below I'll see you in my next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
