pretty sure this is like the third
outfit you're seeing me in today I'm
just being very indecisive about like I
don't know my hair and like what I want
to wear and of course they have swatches
here that are stained on my hand but
anyway in this video I have a quick
little review and swatches for you guys
I'm nothing new color pop sculpting
sticks so I did purchase two of these I
purchased these shades relevé which is
like a cream highlighting product and
then I also purchased the shaded of so I
did do a demo on these i will link that
video down below if you would like to
see how i personally like to apply these
but I purchased these four five dollars
apiece on the colour-pop calm website i
will link below in the description
barber you guys can pick them up as well
if you are interested they have a really
nice shade selection like lots of like
warm contour shades and cool contour
shades they have lots of different
highlighting shades I think that this
shade releve was the latest one that I
could personally find that one or gummy
there but I believe they have around
fifteen shades like 13 to 15 different
shades so I think for five dollars this
is a pretty good deal you do get let's
see here 1.3 grams or 0.05 ounces of
product in here and yeah so overall I
think that these are pretty good quality
for five dollars you really can't beat
it I will say I definitely prefer the
contouring shade over the highlighting
shade if you guys do watch it the demo
you would see that when i'm applying the
highlighting shade no matter if i'm
blending it out with my fingers or a
sponge or i'm blending it out with a
brush it really starts to get like
balled up and patchy and really
emphasizes my pores when i do like the
little V underneath where you want to
highlight now I don't think to have this
issue around my nose area or on my chin
but right here in this cheek area no
matter what kind of primer I where I
feel like this shade releve just really
really kind of balls up and sinks right
into my skin which is weird because you
would think if you would wear a certain
primer that would help with that you
wouldn't have that issue but yeah I feel
like every time I use this I'm just
really really disappointed it is not
completely mad but they do have some
matte options as well on the websites
you can get some shimmery ones or some
matte ones this would have a little bit
of an iridescent to it and I feel like
it goes on to the hand a lot better let
me show you guys some swatches so here's
the shade relevé and it's really
beautiful and
no actual like texture or the
formulation of it is so lightweight like
I don't even feel like I'm touching
anything like it honestly just feels
like air and if you are expecting these
to give you like a little bit of
coverage or something like that that's
not what they are for they are just for
highlighting and contouring so you can
use these before you put on your
foundation or after you put on your
foundation I do find that with this
particular shade of deer elevation I
like it you know I don't know I mean I
don't really like it in general but i
would say i would personally like to
wear it like before i go in with my
foundation if that makes sense now in
the demo today i did put it on after I
did my foundation and that was okay too
but I just feel like it really starts to
cling to my pores when I used it over my
foundation not for the actual contouring
stick this is beautiful this is a very
very nice kind of ashy color here and I
knew immediately when trend mood posted
the photos of all the shades like all
fifteen shades I was like I need that
dub shade it was just beautiful cool
toned really really nice and I was like
yeah I want that in my life and i will
say i feel like the formulation on this
particular one is a lot more plentiful
and smooth and creamy and just easy to
like easier to work with than the
highlighting shade the highlighting
shade is kind of it just emphasizes
texture on your hand it emphasizes
texture on your face and the sheen that
i have is not really like flattering i
guess you could say it's just not the
most flattering machine so here are the
two of them blend it out so there is
dove and then there is releve you can
see you know this definitely brightens
up a little bit but if you look close
enough you can see that it's definitely
patchy on my hand and it looks even
worse when i apply it to my skin so for
five dollars am I going to return it
actually I don't even think you can
return color bought products of course
not i'm not going to return it I think
that the formulation is pretty decent
for five dollars again this is like
drugstore priced as far as the like
contouring shade goes with this
particular one dub this is beautiful
highly recommend checking this out I
would purchase this for like twenty five
dollars I think it's beautiful beautiful
quality they're both very very buttery
and easy to use like they glide on very
very easily to the skin however
something that I do notice is the fact
that they don't have that much
pigmentation so that can be a good thing
and that can also be a bad thing for me
personally that's a good thing because
IM very fair complected
I don't like when I go in with a
contouring stick that's just going to
make me super super dark and you know I
have to worry about oh no maybe I should
not wear this on top of my foundation
maybe I should wear it underneath my
foundation I don't feel like I have that
problem with this particular product at
all or this one I think that they're
really air light and the Arab like them
with airtight air light they're very
light and airy on the skin I feel like
the formulation is nice very very elect
lights on very quickly I will say I do
let you apply these with a brush I like
to buff them into the skin when I use a
sponge that is a little too damp or even
just a damp sponge in general I feel
like it doesn't really blend us out as
well and I think maybe it's because it
has that really like Airy consistency I
feel like beauty blenders or miracle
complexion sponge is from Real
Techniques really blend out product well
when you have something that's a little
more opaque and a little more creepy
these are just so air light yeah I keep
saying airlite you guys know what I mean
they're so fluffy and like light is
there and I just feel like you know the
Beauty Blender kind of takes away some
of the pigmentation and there's not a
whole lot to begin with so anyway I
think overall they're pretty darn good I
wish I would have tried a few more
shades so I could let you guys know if
the formulation is identical on all of
them from what I have seen this
particular shade the relevation is not
really this like same sort of
formulation as the Dove shade that's
just in my opinion I just feel like this
doesn't glide on very nicely it could be
the color it could be that it's just a
little too chalky on my skin I'm not
quite sure but I didn't feel like they
are quite blendable they're worth it for
the five dollars and it's not something
that I would personally like return for
five dollars so anyway let me know down
below if you guys are going to pick a
few of these up I may go ahead and pick
up like a bronzer stick as well I think
these are very comparable to the
Smashbox contouring one two three kids I
have let's see here well I have the
color correcting sticks and then I also
have the contour highlights and also the
bronzer and I feel like they have this
like a similar sort of formulation these
smashbox one's definitely are a little
more easy I don't want to say easy to
blend they're just a little more creamy
and pigmented so I like to wear those
underneath my foundation
but with these because they are so light
I just feel like I can top them on top
of my foundation so yeah that's pretty
awesome I don't know what else to say um
I think they're good are they the most
amazing thing I've ever put on my face
and no but for five dollars I definitely
would go ahead and check them out and
like I said they have a really nice
shade selection you can get some golden
highlights you can get some that are
kind of like um like a little more on
the cool tone side this particular shade
releve I really thought this was the
lightest one but it has a little mud
like it has a little bit of a yellow
undertone I would say or even like a
gold iridescent to it so maybe that's
why it's not very flattering on my skin
tone I do have a cool you know undertone
but yeah that's pretty much it you guys
I hope you enjoyed this quick little
review I will have the demo linked down
below if you are interested in that and
i will see you guys tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
