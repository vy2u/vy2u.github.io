hope you guys are having a great day I
just wanted to before we get started
with this video just talk about my
background what's been going on with
that basically I moved from Manhattan a
couple of days ago my parents or my dad
and I drove to the family cabin which
has been Alexandria Minnesota which is
way up north and just a little
background story really quick just you
guys can kind of understand what's going
on um I grew up in my office I went to
Manhattan for school I have graduated
now I'm done with college I've graduated
with my bachelor's in music so I'm so
happy and now I am here and I am at the
family cabin and I will be here for
three weeks before moving in with my
boyfriend in Milwaukee Wisconsin so
that's kind of what's going on the next
couple of weeks are gonna be you know
maybe a little bit of a change with like
background not a change in my channel
but just a change in background I will
still be filming even though I am kind
of on vacation up here I'm still gonna
be filming and um I'll of course be
filming of course when I move into my
new apartment in Milwaukee so anyway
just wanted to give you guys a little
update of what's been going on with that
whole situation and why I've been having
so many new backgrounds so anyways let's
get started with today's review this is
going to be a new covergirl outlast stay
all day primer it looks like this and I
purchased mine for nine dollars and 47
cents at Walmart so um everybody has
been talking everybody and their mom has
been talking about this primer and also
the foundation that kind of goes with it
um I will be reviewing the foundation
next it's like the stay all day luminous
kind of primer
um I did want to review them separately
just because I have very different
opinions on them so I I will be
reviewing them separately but the video
coming up after this one will be on the
foundation so definitely go check that
one out if you're interested anyway so
let's get started so this is an all day
primer and it really is interesting I
have a lot of things that I like about
it and I have a lot of things that I
actually don't like about it so um
basically it says it is a makeup wear
extender and it is an all-day primer
that keeps your makeup looking fresh
says apply a dime-sized amount to face
before applying makeup and it's also
oil-free so this is not one of those
primers that's saying it's gonna
camouflage pores it's gonna fill in fine
lines it's not that kind of primer
um it's not something that's going to
like blur imperfections and I feel like
a lot of those kind of products have
been coming out lately and I do have a
lot of those products but I just kind of
have not been into them so when I saw
this and I saw that talkie or glam like
go round like guru here on YouTube who
amazing you should definitely check her
out um kind of reviewed this and she
described it as kind of like a
moisturizer on her scam I thought I
really want to try that just because I'm
really not I don't know what it is I
just have not been eaten - like the
silicone II kind of primers lately so
anyway I thought I'd try it out and I
have like mixed feelings about it I'm
going to show you guys what the texture
of the product looks like first so kind
of looks like Elmer's glue except it's
not sticky but it also doesn't feel like
creamy like a silicone product so it
does kind of feel like Tati said a light
moisturizer and it does absorb really
nicely into the skin I would say the
more that you massage it into the skin
the more kind of drying it feels and I
don't mean like drying like oh it's so
dry and it's drying out my skin I just
mean it gets a little like softer like
it really sinks think quickly and it
kind of leaves like a powdery finish to
the skin um so I'm gonna tell you guys
what I don't like about it first before
I tell you what I do like about it just
because there are a few things when I
apply this I've been using it for about
a week now and I am wearing it today
underneath my foundation when I apply
this I notice that it balls up on the
skin every single time I have no idea if
it's the skincare that I'm using prior
to using this or if it's just the
product usually when it starts balling
up on the skin it's usually because a
your it it's too drying for your skin or
B it's because you have used too much of
the product so I have tried really just
applying small amounts larger amounts
and it has balled up on my skin every
single time so what I find myself having
to do is take a cotton pad after I've
applied it and kind of wipe off the
little like tiny little pieces that are
on my skin and I just don't want to have
to go through that step every single
I'm putting on this primer I'm not
interested in that it's just not it's
not fun so I don't want to have to do
that so that's definitely something I'm
not liking about this primer so far it
could be that it is too drying for my
skin even though it really just doesn't
feel dry you know and I do have
combination skin and especially when
it's warmer out like right now I
shouldn't be having those kind of issues
like dry skin so I'm not quite sure what
that's all about but that's definitely
something I don't like about it and the
other thing that I'm kind of not crazy
about is the scent is I don't know you
guys may think I'm crazy because it's so
light but it almost feels a little
chemically like really kind and I'm
usually not I'm sensitive to these kind
of sense but there's something about
this that oh my god no me no there's
something about this that when I'm
putting it on my face I can really smell
it and it's somewhat bothersome to me
and I don't know what it is because that
kind of stuff has never really bothered
me but something about that scent and I
want to show you guys right now can you
see how it's kind of balled up on my
skin right there that's what I'm talking
about I don't like that so um that you
know it's already balling up on my skin
and that's just on my hand so I really
really don't like that
I have tried putting a dime sized amount
I've tried putting a you know even
smaller amount and even larger amount
and I have the same problem
I just want you guys to know I am
wearing it all over my face today and
even on my eyes I just want to show you
guys that it actually makes a nice
decent eye primer I'm not wearing tons
of I just have like a one shadow on my
eye right now but I haven't had any
creasing and I do notice that when I'm
wearing it um with different eyeshadows
it doesn't crease that you know it's not
that bad so maybe I'll end up using it
as an eye primer I'm not sure if I keep
having this issue with it balling up on
my skin obviously I'm not gonna want to
use it on my skin because it just takes
another you know chunk of time by wiping
off all the excess little like parts
that get bubbled up on the skin so
anyway that's what I don't like about it
however what I do like about it is the
fact that it really does extend beware
of your makeup um I'll put this on in
the morning and I'll put any kind of
foundation on top like today I am
wearing that
ebrill foundation the luminous one and
it's really looking nice on the skin um
I would say that it's been probably five
to six hours so it really looks still
quite nice and I just feel like it still
looks fresh and I have tried this with a
few other foundations and I've just
noticed that they all really look good
by the end of the day and I really
noticed that it really kind of sticks to
my face so I really really love it for
that reason if I am going out in the
heat like say for my birthday I'm going
to Disney World with my boyfriend um
I'll probably bring this as a primer
because this really makes you know my
foundation lasts all day and I
absolutely love that um you know I won't
mind taking that extra step because of
wiping you know the little bits off
after I applied it because it stays all
day you know makes my makeup last all
day why would I care so um that's really
kind of my thoughts on it I'm sorry my
Lighting's getting a little weird here
there we go um but so yeah my thoughts
are that you know I don't like that it
kind of takes a little longer because I
have to wipe off the extra product that
like balls up on the skin however I do
like it because it works as an eye
primer and also it really really does
extend the wear of my makeup so anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed this review I will
link below where you guys can pick this
product up and I'll see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
