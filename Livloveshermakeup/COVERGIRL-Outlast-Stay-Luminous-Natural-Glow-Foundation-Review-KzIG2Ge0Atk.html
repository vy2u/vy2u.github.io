hope you guys are having a great day
today it's review or this other review
that I'm posting today it's going to be
on the new covergirl outlast stay
luminous natural glow foundation it
looks like this and everybody and their
mom has been talking about this lately
everybody has been reviewing it and I
just thought I need to get on the
bandwagon and review it myself just for
reference I have combination skin I do
not have dry skin I do not have super
oily skin I just have combination skin
so when I saw this natural glow
foundation and I was a little hesitant
just because I do get oily in my t-zone
and I was not sure if I wanted to try a
product like this however um I am liking
it and I don't think it's too glowy
so anyway let me show you guys or pick
up my receipt and tell you guys how much
this cost this covergirl foundation was
nine dollars and 47 cents um it does
come with an outlast primer which I
reviewed right before this this
particular video so if you guys are
interested go check that one out I'm
wearing them together today so I'm
wearing the primer and I'll bring the
foundation on top I want to let you guys
know right away I'm just wearing the
foundation I'm not wearing concealer I
did set it with the NYC smooth skin
pressed face powder in translucent which
looks like this it's not too matte and
it's oops my lighting it's not too matte
and it's also just not like too sheer if
that makes sense so I feel like if I'm
gonna be wearing a glowy foundation I
kind of want you know a powder that's
not too matte and then also I did apply
this foundation with my Real Techniques
sponge that's why it's dirty I have
tried it a few different ways I saw
quite a few people actually like it like
applying it with a brush they prefer it
that way
I actually prefer it with my sponge
which is no coincidence or no not a
shocker I guess you could say because um
I just love sorry my cat is distracting
me jumping all over um it's really not a
shocker that I like to apply it with my
sponge because I love my Beauty Blender
i love my Real Techniques sponge so not
really surprised that I like it more
than the brush I think that the sponge
gives them more coverage and I do prefer
it with the Real Techniques not the
Beauty Blender so
anyway that is my favorite way to apply
it that is how I'm wearing it today I
have been trying to sound a out for
about six to seven days so about a week
and yeah I just want to say right away
this glow that you're seeing here is the
hard candy blush in honeymoon I just
want to tell you guys that ahead of time
so that you don't think that it's the
foundation that's giving me that glow
and also I am wearing the hard candy
baked bronzer in Tiki and this is my
highlight today so just so you guys are
aware that kind of glow that's going on
there is not from the actual foundation
so let's get started shall we so
basically like I said I purchased this
foundation for nine dollars and forty
seven cents and I was really excited to
try it I just thought it was gonna be
really nice I love the original cover
girl outlast foundation I think it's
amazing it's awesome so I was very very
excited to pick this up the color that I
got was in 810 and it is in the shade
classic ivory so this is a pretty good
color match for me I really don't have
too much you know bad things to say
about it it really does you know I would
say it like the basic color is a good
match the undertone is a little off it's
a little more pink than what I naturally
am in my skin but that's okay so as you
guys can see this really kind of blends
out really nicely it is sort of thick it
kind of has the consistency of the
original outlast foundation which is
kind of surprising to me I don't know
why but I just thought that it was gonna
be a lot more sheer and I probably
wasn't gonna get as much coverage and I
actually have to say I think that you
don't get as much coverage as you do
with the original one however this one
is a lot more buildable so it builds up
nicely without looking cakey and I
really really appreciate that the other
one it kind of goes on full coverage and
you kind of have to put it on quickly
because it dries a little fast kind of
like the Revlon Colorstay this one is
really nice and liquidy you can kind of
just you know take it from the back of
your hand put it all over and then put
it on you know with your sponge and you
don't have to wait you don't have to do
it quickly you know it's great it just
kind of sits there and waits for you to
be ready for it so I really like that I
do want to say that um
like the natural glow thing so basically
this foundation has a very very very
small shimmer particles in it a lot of
people are gonna say that it doesn't
because they're probably not looking at
it in natural sunlight however I did
take this and I brought you know put it
on the back of my hand and I looked at
it in the sunlight in direct sunlight
you can definitely definitely see some
shimmer in there it's not chunks of
glitter it is very very finely milled
shimmer so don't worry too much it's not
gonna be crazy noticeable or anything
like that but I do want to let you guys
know because I know there was a
foundation from Revlon that came out
maybe a few years back that really
everybody I think it was the photo ready
where I mean it really really had some
shimmer in there a lot of people did not
like it they were really gonna look like
a vampire disco ball when I go outside
in the Sun so that's something to be
aware of however I must say that you
know um once I have like the rest of my
face products on I really don't notice
the shimmer on my face if I go in direct
sunlight like in you know the light and
I'm looking at my face I don't really
notice it but when it was just on the
back of my hand I did so maybe if you
are not setting it it's gonna be more
noticeable like I said this NYC powder
that I set it with today really kind of
you know not super super mattifies
everything but it does give a little bit
of coverage kind of sheer coverage and
it does like cover a little more so I
would think that if you are setting it
with powder you're probably less likely
to notice the shimmer however if you are
just putting it on and you don't want to
set it with anything you might notice
the shimmer more so that's another thing
I want to get into is the fact that I
like to set this it is glowy I mean when
I'm putting it on I'm not I you know
like I said I'm combination skin there
are some foundations that I can get away
with where I don't have to set it my
preferred method is always to send all
these alerts hold on a sec got a
incoming call my preferred method is to
always always set my foundations that's
just what I like that's just what I
prefer however um with this one I can't
it's too oily it's not that it's oily
it's just too glowy it's too dewy I
to set it and yeah but I will say if you
do have dry skin like really really dry
skin or maybe more mature skin this
would probably be really really
beautiful on the skin because you can
work up the coverage and also you may
not need to set it so anyway those are
kind of my thoughts on the new covergirl
outlast stay luminous natural glow
foundation I find that it does last very
well on my skin it doesn't get too
patchy um I just like the finish it
gives you know it feels light but it's
buildable like you really can cover some
stuff up you know like I said today I am
just wearing this I'm not wearing any
concealer and I really like you know the
look that it gives so I hope you guys
enjoyed this review I will link below
where you guys can pick up this product
and I'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
