in this video I am going to be reviewing
and also demoing for you guys the new
super sizer mascara from covergirl
everybody has been talking about this
lately and really really raving about it
so I wanted to try out I saw a great
review from emilynoel83 on her expressed
channel I saw a great review from melts
so i thought i'd definitely need to try
it out so i purchased this for about
twelve or thirteen dollars at a Duane
Reade when I was in Manhattan so I've
had this for quite a while now for about
three weeks um like I said it came out
probably about a month ago so I did get
it right when it came out but I just had
not had time to review it for you guys
out I wanted to review it and I kind of
filmed a video for it and then I thought
you know what I really should demo it
just to show you guys exactly what I
like about it so I really really like it
I'm really excited because I love when I
find a great great mascara from the
drugstore and this is definitely one I
recently reviewed the miss manga rocker
miss manga rock I'm mascara and I
actually like this one better which is
really crazy because the miss manga or
miss manga wine is one that I really
really love from l'oreal and just from
the drugstore in general so anyway I
thought I would demo with this and
review it for you guys today like i said
i purchased it for twelve to thirteen
dollars that are very expensive that was
the price in manhattan if you live on
either of the coasts i recommend
ordering online from probably like
Walmart or Target I am now up north
right now in Minnesota at my parents
cabin and I went to walmart the other
day and saw it for seven or eight
dollars so you can definitely get it for
cheaper I believe they do have a
waterproof formula and a regular formula
i picked up the regular one just because
i noticed that when i use waterproof
mascara it usually takes my eyelashes
with it when i remove the mascara so i
don't like that so I you know just have
been kind of avoiding waterproof mascara
lately even though it's really hard
because I do get transfer up here
usually a lot during the summertime in
the warmer months but anyway a little
rant going on there basically I have a
medium length eyelashes
they're not very thick but they are you
know they're more like lengthen to them
thick so I don't have tons of lashes so
I really really don't like when I use of
waterproof mascara and then I remove it
and it takes all my eyelashes with them
like I need those so anyway um like I
said this you know you can get this for
around seven or eight dollars there I
believe there is a waterproof formula
the shade i got was a black ass black or
the darkest black that they had i think
they also do have like a brown a deep
brown shade and maybe a light brown
shade but no like colorful shades or
anything like that but anyway I really
really like this so far I really love
the formula formula is pretty wet which
I personally do like because I find that
if the formula is too dry it just starts
to flake off during the day and i'll
show you guys the wand this is what the
warmth looks like and you can see it's
kind of tapered like it is smaller at
the base and then it gets bigger at the
top and it's kind of weird what's going
on here it's got these tiny tiny little
short you know bristles and then it got
even tinier ones on the side so the wan
kind of goes like this and they actually
recommend when you're applying it to
move your wand like this however i don't
use that technique because i found that
it just made it really messy aid when i
was trying to move it that way i would
get stuff all up here and I'm already
pretty messy when applying my mascara so
that didn't personally work for me but I
can see why they would want you to try
that technique I don't think that it
makes that much of a difference I like
to just apply it the way I normally
would I think that's the best you know
way to apply it in my opinion but
because like it is tapered and because
the wand is kind of winding I think
that's why they recommend applying it
like this and then rolling it up so
anyway um you can see that there's
really really tiny bristles at the
bottom and then they get longer towards
the top and I don't know what it is
about this wand I mean I really really
love rubber bonds so I knew I probably
like this one um I'm not going to what
it is but this gives really really
really great length and volume it's not
like super super lengthening like the
L'Oreal telescopic however it gives
equal amounts of length and volume which
I really really like and I think the
brush is just so funky and it really
just applies beautifully i noticed that
i really really enjoy applying it
lower lashes which is something that's
very interesting because normally I like
a mascara a lot for applying it on the
upper lashes and then usually lower
lashes it's a little hard and it's a
little messy but i actually prefer this
on the lower lashes that on the upper
lashes but anyway um I want to talk too
much more i really like it i think it's
great i'm going to demo it for you guys
right now i would say you can probably
probably did get away with you or get
away with about two coats of this before
it gets too clumpy i will apply to
today's you guys can see but let's just
get started so i already curled my
lashes I did 10 seconds on each side so
that is not my normal amount that i
usually do so i'm going to go one more
time and just do 20 seconds on each side
because i normally do 30 so just kind of
pumping it like that and i noticed that
if i don't curl my lashes because they
are kind of medium length they will just
fall right away no matter what the
formula of the mascara is so like i said
i like to do 30 seconds on each side and
just kind of pump it like that so that
you're not getting a crimp you're
actually getting a curl I'm guessing
that's approximately another 20 seconds
like I said I did 10 before but normally
I go 1 2 3 i'm very picky but anyway
let's just get started so um when I pull
it out you can see it gets stuck on the
end like normal that's pretty usual for
a mascara so I just kind of wipe it off
on the top and I'm just going to get
started so let's start with the upper
lashes just going to start applying it
so what I notice right away is that
thickness is great and I really really
love thickness to my lashes because like
I said I have kind of you know you
usually usually some people are really
lucky in half length and thickness but
usually it's only one and I didn t have
more length than thickness so i really
love when I can find a mascara that
volumizes but yeah so I'm going to hit
the back of the lashes but I noticed
that this was really really volume eyes
as well for me and i love the formula is
so
pitch pitch black it's really really
great so that is Supes that is one coat
on the side yes it did get a little
messy up there I'll take care of that in
a second can I go over to the other side
I'm sorry I'm going to read it just so
you guys can see you dip it on this side
and I do kind of like I don't like to
twist it as I go but I do like to
experiment with different sides I'm not
quite sure the exact formula that i love
but i do like the combination of the
smaller bristles and the larger ones so
i do like to kind of turn it not like as
i go up but just once in a while turn it
so that i get a different side because
you know i'd hold on to the product
really well hit the back of the lashes
that really helps to lengthen and like i
said i think that you really can get
away with i'm great dipping my wand each
time as i go in but you really can get
away with um you know one coat as you
guys can see it's already really really
volumize and linked into my lashes i'm
going to go on to the lower lashes now
and like i said i love this wand but the
lower lash it letter know what it is but
it just makes it so easy to get all you
know just really really is great gets
into those tiny little corn RS and it's
just really good stuff so underneath and
i'm going to read if i'm just showing
you guys um you know and even coat on
the upper and bottom lashes of each side
I read ipping it you can easily get away
with you know dipping it and then doing
what I and then dipping it again and
doing the other you don't have to read a
bit for the lower either but i just want
to show you guys and i just noticed that
this formula is so dark and black and i
really really love that like it's so
inky in black you know so as you guys
can see it is really volumize to my
lashes now and that is one layer one
coat and i just love the way it looks it
really opens the eyes up i am wearing um
a black eye
mmm on my you know my gosh I'm blinkin
right now I am wearing a black eyeliner
on the tight line and also the water
line which actually makes my eyes pure
you know appear smaller usually it kind
of makes them look a little smaller but
I feel like the semester really just
opens them up and it looks great and
they you know when you tight line with a
black it really kind of makes the bottom
of the lashes appear really thick too
but I also think this black is black
formula is great because it's so dark
and it really just makes everything look
thicker so anyway that is the first
layer we're going to let that sit and
kind of dry like I said it is a wet
formula so you want to give it a second
and then we are going to go back in and
do the same exact thing and this is
really the second layer is really where
I would say the furthest you can
probably go with this mascara before it
gets really really clumpy some people
might not want to go past the first
layer I'm somebody who doesn't really
mind letting out clumps however this is
where now it can get a little iffy so
back in and we tipped it for this side
right so that's two layers for the top
and you can see here like sometimes I
just like to go and separate them a
little more here you cannot always use
one of those little utensils to to kind
of separate them but I'm not going to do
that in this video just so you guys can
see exactly what you're getting but the
little bristles are so like separated on
the one that actually makes it easy to
kind of separate them without having to
go in with tweezers or you know a little
last tool so anyway that has two layers
on the upper and now we are going to do
the lower lashes going to get back in
and go in on the side can always go like
this too but I feel like that gets them
plombier and usually on the second layer
you don't want to do that because that
will get them really really Chloe and I
feel like this really kind of gives them
definition like you know nicely so I
don't want to ruin that definition that
I've gotten so far because I do like
that you know kind of clumpy definition
but not crazy clumpy so that is two
layers on that I now we're going to get
back in and go to the other you can
already see the difference between one
and two on the lower lashes this one
really just said it gets even you know
more lengthened the volume kind of stays
the same i would say for the second
layer but the length really starts to
build which i think is great I don't
notice transfer during the day with this
one if I do it's not only lower lashes
it's usually on the upper lashes and
it's up here when I go like that i
usually get little black lines there so
don't really love that maybe that
wouldn't happen with the waterproof
formula but then again you know the
waterproof formula steals my eyelashes
so I mean every single waterproof
formula takes my eyelashes with it so
I'd rather keep them and deal with a
little bit of you know smudging I don't
find that I need to like retouch or
anything during the day and if i do
retouch after it has completely dried in
between
layers then it looks a lot more comfy so
i recommend kind of just laying it
almost set not completely but almost so
anyway i'm just going to go and kind of
make sure that there's not tons and tons
of cloves I think you guys can kind of
get the gist of what this mascara does
you know it volumizes and it lengthens
and it's got this wonderful wonderful
really deep dark formula so I'm just
gonna let it sit for a second and I'm
going to go in and take care of the mess
I made pretty typical of me um so just
laying it kind of sit for a second but i
think i can see that is what it looks
like so far I kind of dry you don't want
to be sneezing right now then we'll go
everywhere but um I prefer wet formulas
in my opinion I just feel like you can
feel them better and I'm one of those
people that does like to build up you
know my product so anyway I'm going to
use my real techniques setting brush and
go into this wet and wild color icon
contouring palette I'm going to go into
the highlight shade this isn't 758
caramel toffee I've been loving this
this is new to me I've been loving this
but I'm just gonna go like on the top
just so you can kind of wipe off some of
that product you want to make sure that
it's completely dry but just because I
don't have q-tips down here with me
right now normally I would just kind of
wipe it off and if you wait until the
mascara is completely dry than it
usually should just flight right off but
this will take care of it for now and go
a little bit underneath to also kind of
Brighton case there are little areas
that you kind of fell down while offline
I'm going to go in with my Sigma
blending eat 25 and going to that
contour shade just hit into the crease a
little bit just so you guys can see more
dimension I didn't wear any I shadows
today just so you could see what it
looks like without you know I shadows
but if you build a little bit you know
into the crease you can see you get even
more it looks like dramatic you know
kind of look lashes just makes
everything look a little darker and
thicker and very very nice
so like that oops that one got a little
little pump together go back to the
setting brush and just going to bloom
that up just so you guys can kind of see
what it does look like this you know I
shadows let me just quickly go and move
that a little bit you can see it did not
completely dry yet so you really want to
wait a little bit in between the best
mascara but anyway this is the look of
two layers of that mascara like I said
it's not completely dry yet it's a
little tacky but I will go in after with
a q-tip and remove anything else that
has gotten you know all over I'm messy
anyway when I apply my mascara but this
is the look you get as you can see it's
really volumize a little clumpy I think
that one layer is absolutely enough when
it comes to this mascara but if you
really want a lot of definition and you
know to really really you know draw
attention to your eyes two layers is
okay it's not going to overdo it three
layers is too much I have tried doing
three layers as way too much so I don't
recommend that but this is what two
layers looks like I actually in my
opinion think one layer looks better
amazingly enough because I'm actually
someone who loves to layer mascaras but
this one does not layer the best but I
do find that it looks you know good with
two but I think better with one so
that's good news up because that means
you could just do it quickly and it will
look good in one coat but anyway that is
my review and my demo on the super sizer
mascara from covergirl I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I will link below
reread can pick it up for the cheapest
price probably walmart.com and i'll see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
