today's video is going to be all about
brands that are cruelty free as well as
brands that are not cruelty free brands
that are cruelty free but that are owned
by parent companies that are not cruelty
free I'm going to talk a little bit
about this and I want to say right off
the bat I got all of my information from
logical harmony she has that you belong
she has a website I'm going to go ahead
and link it down below in the
description bar that is where I like to
get all of my information on being and
cruelty free I also like cruelty free
kitty I do find that logical harmony
tends to be a little more exact when it
comes to you know okay is it cruelty
free but is it owned by a parent company
she really lets you know and then she
also tells you if the product is vegan
things like that so yes I have really
been into logical harmony thank you so
much to all of you that recommended I
build and shout out her page I believe I
please so how's it YouTube actually so
I'm gonna leave that to UM below as well
she's really really wonderful so anyway
yeah like I said we are talking about
brands the do tests on animals brands
that don't test on animals I just have a
list here on my phone and I want a walk
I want to walk those through some brands
that do not test on animals that are
just like a hundred percent cruelty free
and then also some brands are cruelty
free but won't back hair into companies
so I'll talk a little bit about that and
then also just some not so cruelty free
makeup brands and the reason why I want
to just kind of list it out like this is
because I'm giving you so many questions
is this cruelty free is this cruelty
free is this cruelty free definitely go
look on logical harmony she will give
you an entire list of either a gray area
or a pending page which is like it's
kind of up in the air she will tell you
if it's vegan she'll tell you if it's
cruelty free if it's not so definitely
definitely go and visit that website you
guys it's very very helpful so obviously
I didn't list down every single thing
this would take forever but I did want
to kind of start with the brands that
are 100% cruelty free and let me just
tell you guys first of all why I am
personally doing this I'm doing this for
the animals I do eventually want to be
completely vegan again I want to be
living a very vegan lifestyle
no child labor and no you know just just
no products that are tested on animals
or you know like young kids are making
these products over in China things like
that I could go into a whole whole
different rant about that but you guys
know what I mean I'm just trying to be a
little smarter about what I am
purchasing so that brands even though
I'm just one person hopefully they can
start to understand oh hey okay
they don't like that we shouldn't do
that anymore so anyway let's go ahead
and start with some brands that are 100%
cruelty free like I said there are
plenty out there definitely go take a
look at illogical harmonies complete
list but I just wanted to put them out
there that maybe you guys knew or didn't
know about so the first one is hourglass
hourglass is a 100% cruelty free which
is awesome I really really do like their
ambient lighting powders now I know some
people are not really into their blushes
and actually they're you know what a lot
of people are not used to like the
ambient lady formula in general I think
one of the reasons why I like it is
because I do like very natural makeup
and it just gives it beautiful like glow
from within kind of look to your skin
the powders do the blushes do everything
looks amazing so yeah our left is great
and they are 100% cruelty free Anasazi
of Beverly Hills also 100% cruelty free
they released some really really good
items not a huge fan of these like
limited edition things that kind of pop
on for what like a day or two and then
they're gone but I do think on associate
Beverly Hills I have to get no credit
for being 100% cruelty free now Kat Von
D a little bit of a tricky situation she
kind of fits into this category but kind
of doesn't there have been talks that
she's trying to break away from her
parent company who even though they are
cruelty free they do own other brands
that test on animals it's very is gonna
complicate you guys but cap on day for
the most part I mean it's cruelty free
her line is cruelty free but she also
has a lot of vegan products now don't
get twisted not every single one of
her products is vegan I know that she is
trying to make it so that they all will
be eventually but as of right now they
are not so definitely check that
ingredients list the next one is
make cosmetics now I have not purchased
a lot from them but I really want to try
out their brightening powder so very
very happy that they are cruelty free
Charlotte Tilbury really really
luxurious beautiful line I was recently
sent some products from Charlotte
Tilbury
I did not like the brushes I was set to
that I absolutely adore the makeup it is
impeccable so really really happy to
know that there is a luxury brand out
there that does not test on animals
because a lot of them do color pop is a
cruelty-free brand which is awesome
cover FX is as well and elf cosmetics oh
that is very exciting because nowadays
it is very hard to find a drugstore
brand and that doesn't test on animals
I feel like L'Oreal Maybelline
practically everybody does so yes elf
cosmetics is cruelty free which is
awesome I'm a flower beauty also from
the drugstore I have heard some really
really awesome things about their new
contouring palettes and they're
highlighting palettes gosh cosmetics
they make one of my favorite CC creams
of life I believe they are really only
only pick them up if you're on the East
Coast like in a Walgreens but a really
really good brand makeup geek is a
hundred percent cruelty free which is
awesome Milani is one from the drugstore
as well both for cosmetics I really love
the Rotato Drive highlighter from them
so I may have to pick up some more items
from them and I do actually like their
liquid lipstick formulation which is
crazy because I never like liquid
lipstick all right let's see here
Pacifica Pacifica is 100% cruelty free
and they are also on a percent vegan
which is awesome I do think that they
need to work on their makeup products a
little more but for the most part a lot
of their skincare items are good pixie
pixie is a cruelty free brand which is
awesome I haven't tried too much up
their makeup but I really do like their
skincare on especially like the glow
tonic and things like that
excuse me I feel like I'm losing my
voice but anyway I wanted to ask you
guys do you want to see a like skincare
edition of this where I kind of talked
through some brands that are and aren't
cruelty free because a lot of you seem
to be really really confused and like oh
my god what when I talk about skincare
brands that do tests on animals
let me know if you also want a skincare
addition to this eating other brands
that um make a brand that does not test
on animals is our C and a now I heard
really good things about their Pro
setting powder I've never tried it but
now I really want to and finally the
balm cosmetics is also kind of percent
cruelty for you which is awesome alright
now let's go ahead and talk about some
brands that are cruelty free they do not
test on animals you guys but they are
owned by parent companies and that do
tests not animals so the first one I
want to talk about is urban decay and
they are cruelty free and most of the
products are vegan but their parents
company is L'Oreal L'Oreal bought them
out in 2012 and L'Oreal is like crazy
with animal testing absolutely crazy I'm
not gonna link pictures down below for
you guys but I have seen some horrible
horrible pictures from supposedly the
L'Oreal like testing place I don't know
if it was for sure but the person was
wearing some sort of law real thing so
whatever no matter what it's horrible it
doesn't matter if it was that L'Oreal or
know that Estee Lauder wherever it's
horrible horrible horrible but they do
to these animals so yeah urban decay
although they are cruelty free and most
of their products are vegan and their
parent company is L'Oreal so a lot of
people have a hard time buying it from a
brand you know it's kind of like an
umbrella so basically saying okay
underneath we have cruelty free and then
on top you know you're basically giving
your money to this corporation that does
tests on animals so does that mean that
you are cruelty free or that you aren't
I really haven't made my mind up yet I
haven't decided so right now I'm kind of
leaning more towards you know what I
think if a brand is cruelty free its
cruelty free as long as I pick up that
makeup item and I know that it wasn't
tested on an animal I feel like that is
good enough for me I would love to hear
what you guys think down below but the
second one
I talk about East to face so - faith is
a cruelty-free company but they were
bought out by Estee Lauder for like what
was it's like twenty two point four
billion dollars and they were bought out
in let's see here 2016 you know this
happened recently advice it was really
crazy because so many people loved that
to face was like me here in America
really really anything that they did was
just beautiful to face is my favorite
brand so the fact that they did end up
selling a to Estee Lauder I mean there's
a part of me that's like wow congratz
because they made a shitload of money
and but at the same time I'm like really
a state lottery like Estee Lauder and
L'Oreal are just so so so it's like they
own everything you know what I mean and
I really do think that they are some of
the worst offenders when it comes to to
animal testing so probably just because
they own practically every single brand
but yeah so to face was bought out by
Estee Lauder and a lot of people will be
purchasing from them anymore because of
that next let's go ahead and talk about
some of the brands that are not cruelty
free so the first one is L'Oreal we also
have um a amazing cosmetics of Bobby
Brown Clarins
Clinique covergirl dermablend Dior dr.
jart st edits and the Estee Lauder line
our money is Yvonne she lancome laura
mercier mac makeup forever Neutrogena
NYC Polly do a Revlon Rimmel Stila and
YSL all of those products are tested I
am use all of those brands tests on
animals so that is really unfortunate
there are some awesome awesome brands in
there and actually I'm sorry I made a
mistake Stila just recently became
cruelty free so Stila is off that list
they are 100% cruelty free that are not
even owned by a parent company that
tests on animals so that's awesome but
you know like what is sell and Armani
and Giovanni I'm thinking like these are
luxury brands you know they would still
make money even if they didn't you know
test on animals but it is what it is so
a lot of them like I said are owned by
Lancome Estee Lauder L'Oreal it seems
like they own everything so I just
wanted to give you guys a little quick
understanding of some brands and that
are 100%
to free some that are kind of like in an
umbrella so if they're cruelty free but
that their parent company is not and
then some brands that are just 100% not
cruelty free so anyway let me know if
you want me to do a video kind of about
also vegan a makeup I don't know if I'm
really gonna get into that but you know
well you know so let me know if you want
to see that and then also if you want to
see a senior edition of this so yeah
thank you so much for joining me guys I
really hope that you enjoyed this video
and I will see you guys in my next one
