thank you so much for joining me i hope
you are all having a fantastic day this
video is going to be a collab with my
friend belly here on youtube or melissa
i'm going to leave her instagram below
her video and also her YouTube page so
that you guys can go over and say hello
to her but I love Melissa she recently
reached out to me and said would you
like to collaborate and do a top ten
under ten video and I was like yes I
would so she's doing her video a little
differently than I am I'm pretty sure
she's showing you guys her top 10
favorites of all time that are under ten
dollars that would take me forever
because there is definitely more than 10
products so what I'm personally doing is
showing you guys my current top ten
under ten that way I can also do one in
the future and then I can show you guys
like current you know top ten under ten
favorite so I thought that would be fun
and I'm so happy that she reached out to
me because I love Mellie and like I said
we've been following each other for a
long time here on YouTube I'm subscribe
to her channel she's subscribed to my
channel and we also live in the same
city so one day we're gonna get together
and do some shopping probably some
makeup shopping or go to a museum or
something like that and yeah I would
love if you guys went over and checked
her out and tell her I said hello and
let's just get into my current top ten
under ten so the first item I want to
talk about is the wet and wild photo
focused setting spray I've been loving
this this is an amazing setting spray it
smells really good I feel like it really
seals and my makeup all day long I spray
it on after i put my primer on and then
after i finish my makeup and I just feel
like it's amazing it's just so darn good
there is alcohol in here alcohol there
is alcohol in here like a lot of other
setting spray so if you do have dry skin
you may want to you know stay away from
this one but for the most part I think
it's just as good as the Urban Decay
ones and I am loving it definitely a
current favorite and I believe that's
around five dollars at the drugstore
yeah i think i got it for five dollars
at walgreens alright the next item i
want to talk about is the Maybelline
master glaze by face studio blush stick
in the shade coral sheen number 30 this
is amazing these are like the creamiest
blush sticks ever and I believe you can
get these for around seven ninety-nine
at walmart or target or the drugstore
this is a beautiful beautiful color I
love
coral color I wear this on my lips I
wear it on my cheeks it's really
gorgeous if you wear it as like a base
blush so you put this on and then you
top it with like a powder blush I think
it's gorgeous that's the color right
there and look how blendable and creamy
these are they definitely have to
methacholine them that kind of silicone
e of ingredient which is why they're so
blendable but they just leave a
beautiful sheen on the lips or the
cheeks and I just love that particular
shape so that is the second one the
third one I want to talk about is a
lipstick and i have not wear this on
camera yet because i'm scared that
people are gonna judge me normally i
don't care at all what people think
about me but this is a very very bold
lipstick and i'm scared someone's gonna
be like that is not your color so i'm
thinking next week is gonna be all about
bold lip sticks on my channel and i'm
going to be rocking or hopefully rockin
a new bold lipstick every single day and
this is the Maybelline um what is this
called the Vivid's and this is in the
shade 905 breath and Barry it's a
gorgeous bright purple shade it actually
doesn't come off of this pigmented it
looks a little more pink toned on the
lips but you guys I love this color I
just love this this has definitely been
a current favorite that is under ten
dollars I think you can get this for 549
that's how much I picked mine up for at
Walmart so yeah love love love love love
give this video thumbs up if you would
like to see me wear this next week see
what it looks like on my legs alright
moving on I have another let's take the
item and loving that is under ten
dollars this is from the Revlon super
lustrous lipstick mine it is a creme it
is in for 35 love that pink and I really
love this big it is beautiful it's like
a mixture of a red coral pinky shade and
I just love the way it goes on the lips
anytime I wear this I always get
questions about what is on my lips
because I feel like it's such a unique
color it really has that coral it really
has that pink and then it has that
mixture of red in there and it's just so
beautiful on the lips I can't get over
it and I love
it's a creme formula because it's very
very comfortable as well so that is the
next one and this is i believe around
449 or 549 at walmart or target alright
moving on i recently picked up some of
these palladio crushed eyeshadows these
are awesome I think they're around what
five or six dollars a piece at the alte
store or online store I do like this one
a little more and I'm technically only
showing one of them because the two of
them combined is over ten dollars i
believe but the first one that i have is
called xenon and it's a gorgeous kind of
dirty green color with a lot of gold in
it I've been loving that kind of weird
dirty green color for whatever reason
and then the second one is called
Eclipse and this is a beautiful kind of
coppery color these are super pigmented
they go on like a foiled I shadow and I
love the way they look on my lid so
they're just really really beautiful
super super-shiny and I think they're
amazing and they're under ten dollars
each so look at that it's a beautiful
love these so that is what my fit six
favorite alright the next one I want to
talk about I get at walmart and this is
under I think even five dollars this is
the hard candy glow all the way it is
infused with 24-karat gold who knows
whatever this is called doll face face
and body aluminized and this one is in
the shade Oh doll face this is how much
product you get it's amazing this is a
really really good liquid illuminator
you can mix it with your foundation you
can just like tap a little bit onto your
cheekbones you can do whatever you want
with it but it's amazing it's so so so
good you get so much in here and these
are very comparable to the NARS liquid
illuminators I have two of those I have
super orgasm and then I have Copacabana
I believe yeah that this is a very
comparable like same sort of formulation
this one is even the thicker and
creamier and look at that color look at
that glow it's a beautiful like ethereal
sort of pink color if you have fair skin
you would absolutely love this I think
it's an incredible color and just
beautiful on the skin alright Mahan is
seriously starting to get all disgusting
looking now so we're gonna go to this
one crystal watches alright the next
product that I've been love
that is under ten dollars at the
drugstore or just anywhere I know this
is not technically a top ten under ten
from the drugstore but most of the
products are from the drugstore because
they're under ten dollars this is the
Maybelline master conceal my face studio
camouflaging can see Leah could let
conceal ekis gonna see Lars good faith
do it Olivia concealer in the shade 10
fair or Claire and this is what it looks
like and I've been loving this lately my
hair keeps getting in my mouth I am
loving this lately because it just has
such a beautiful formulation to it like
the consistency is super super like
humectant and hydrating it's beautiful
under the eyes and it actually has a
little bit it pulls a little bit of a
warm undertone like a yellowy undertone
so it really does help to cancel out and
kind of color correct underneath if you
have dark circles underneath your eyes
like me every single morning so yeah I
have been loving that and I believe you
can get that poor seven dollars and 49
cents at walgreens alright the next
product I want to talk about is the
essence all about Matt fixed compact
powder fix fixing compact powder I get
this for about 3 49 at Alta it's amazing
i just love this now if you do have
darker skin this is going to come off a
little white on your skin it does he
think it honestly Ashlee I cannot speak
it it honestly leaves a little bit of a
white cast even on my skin and I'm
pretty darn white so that's kind of
crazy but I will say I barely have to
retouch like my t-zone and I do a combo
skin so I get very oily in my t-zone
even like throughout the day I normally
have to go back in with my powder
throughout the day I don't with this
product like it's amazing it really
keeps me super super mad if you have dry
skin or aging skin you're not kind of
like this it's gonna be too drying but
for me for oily or her combo skin I
think this is amazing and like I said
it's like 349 at aalto so good alright
the next item I want to talk about is
the Maybelline brow drama pop a crayon I
think this is about nine dollars and
forty-nine cents at the drugstore I got
mine at Target and I have the lightest
shade it is so beautiful it's just a
creamy pomade cran and I prefer like
products like this where i can just kind
of draw them on because i suck at doing
my brows ok so there's the color i have
the latest one that's either called
blonde or ash blonde and it's just
really easy to work with it glides
really easily it probably has some time
at the cone in there which is why it's
so like you know Mike lights on so
easily but it's amazing and I wouldn't
recommend setting it in with a powder or
a gel so it doesn't go anywhere when
it's actually on your brows because i
feel like this product does travel a
little bit but i really love it and it's
just an easy way to fill in the front
like part of my brows really really
quickly in the morning all right and
then the last thing i want to talk about
is that the last one wait 123456789 yep
this is the last one oh my goodness ok
this is the bhcosmetics wild and hard to
baked eyeshadow palette so this is like
five dollars and forty-nine cents on the
bhcosmetics website you get nine baked
eye shadows in here and they can be used
a dry like as is or you can use them wet
so you can spray like any sort of
setting spray and basically like this
one the wet and wild but you can spray
that on to your brush and then use these
and they kind of come off like foiled so
this is what the palette looks like
really really gorgeous colors in here
and I love these colors for spring like
they're just so beautiful you get some
neutrals some pops of color let me go
ahead and swatch a few of them for you
guys so you can see they're super
pigmented and I just love the way that
they look like they're just really
really gorgeous colors they each have a
little bit of a sheen to them not so
much a glitter but just kind of like a
sheen and let me get my hands kind of
wet so that you guys can see what they
look like when they are a little wet
because then they look really really
pigmented and almost foiled so that is
what they look like when they are kind
of wet so you guys can see very very
pigmented and they just kind of become
completely foiled so I really really
love that palette to add it is under ten
dollars and that is definitely a current
favorite so anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed this top ten under ten my
current favorite if you did please go
