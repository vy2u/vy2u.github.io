channel today's video is going to be my
cabin tour so I thought I would walk you
guys through my cabin we are actually
starting outside because again the cabin
is just a cabin it's something that we
come to visit during the summertime and
I thought you know what the best part of
being at the cabin is the lake that
we're on so we are starting down here
and then the actual cabin is all the way
up there but anyway I thought I would
share with you guys first the lake that
we are on we are in Alexandria Minnesota
and this lake is called Lake Carlos so
but were you ever just have our little
kayaks and then we have our sailboats
and our speedboats and this is a
gorgeous gorgeous Lake in northern
Minnesota it is so nice out today it's
beautiful so I just wanted to show you
guys the lake really quickly because
it's a gorgeous gorgeous big beautiful
lake snow and that is the lake that we
are on and then over here we have a plot
of land that we just let kind of stay
wild
and then as you guys can see I'm going
to walk up those steps and up there is
our family cabin so if you guys didn't
know my parents do live in Minneapolis
Minnesota we also have a place down in
Florida and then obviously Tom and I
live in Milwaukee and I was hiding I'm
showing you guys our condo down in
Daytona Beach however I wasn't able to
make it down for that trip I got into a
lupus flare up so I am showing you guys
the cabin today and then during
Christmas time I will be showing you the
new renovated house in Minneapolis and
Mama's renovating the kitchen's
currently and then when we go down to
Daytona during Christmas time as well I
will take you guys for that tour but
anyway this is just our little family
cabin that we come to visit during the
summertime let's go ahead and walk up
these steps and I will show you guys
everything so anyway over here is just
like a little patch of we kind of leave
this untamed as you guys can probably
see it's really hard when your cabin or
a lot of people have houses out here
it's hard when you actually have one
that's like right going down a hill
because it's very hard to mow a lawn
like this so we just let this area kind
of stay untamed and very very natural
and CEMA with the plot of lands that we
own next door and then as you guys can
see here we have a nice mowed lawn here
so here is the cabin
the back again the cabin is actually on
a hill so oh my god I'm getting out of
breath from walking those steps dang
girl
anyway as you guys can see the cabin is
actually on a hill so it expands out
towards the back and from the front it
actually looks really cute and tiny and
really cute so anyway I'll show you guys
that in a second but here is the
backyard so we look out right over the
lake which is absolutely beautiful
there's the other plot of lambs I told
you guys about and yeah this is our
backyard backyard yeah can't speak
backyard area right here is where we
have our little fire pit if we want to
make some mores and things like that and
I just love it out here you guys it is
very very wonderful and beautiful
alright so we are going to go ahead and
I'm going to bring you to the outside
I'm gonna bring you actually around the
actual cabin and then I will show you
guys from the inside and then come
downstairs and come out again but like I
said the most like beautiful parts of
the cabin is definitely the fact that
it's in this nature so let's go ahead
and circle around right there is our
garage by the way let's walk around here
we'll probably run into my dad in there
it's just my dad and I stand here right
now so here we have a bird feeder
another one over there for want to nest
in there we did some gardening here my
dad and I love to garden here we have a
beautiful beautiful apple tree of course
these apples will not be in season until
the fall but we did some gardening work
here as well
and then there is the lake and then we
walk up here and we have a little herb
garden here because we love herbs we
love planting our own vegetables and
fruits and stuff like that so up here we
have our little herb garden as you guys
can see and then here is the actual
front of the cabin so like I said
because it's on a hill from the front
this is what it looks like and then it
expands out towards the back which i
think is really really cool so anyway we
are going to head right in and I will
walk you guys through again it's just a
cabin so not too much to look at but I
just thought it'd be fun
to share with you guys I love watching
like house tours and apartment doors the
cabin tour is so let's do this alright
so when we walk in this is that
everything looks like say hi to my
YouTube friends
that's my dad here is my dad's office
and it overlooks right here so it looks
down careful dad I don't want to run you
over so it looks down on the living room
hi buster he's so cute so this is his
office area and then when you walk
straight through here by the way we took
the sheets off the bed because my
grandpa is coming into town and he will
be probably sleeping in that bed or this
bed so there are two twin beds in here
this is where I sleep every time I come
up to visit and you guys this is my
empties bin for the month I actually
brought my empties up here I feel like
absolutely crazy but anyway this is just
a really cute little kind of lucky room
as you guys can see there's my flute and
a little pinkies and then we walk us
through here and over here we have a
bathroom absolutely nothing special just
a normal bathroom in here and then here
is where my dad and my mom have their
room which is really really beautiful
and they actually have these mirrored I
love this this is like a mirrored closet
I really want this this is like great I
think that's so pretty and again just a
cabin so just a nice small little room
but you can see out towards the lake
really really really pretty and then we
have a little bed here for buster um all
of the animals are here visiting
currently so here are the steps so
anyway turn on the lights a little bit
and go down all of the animals are here
currently because like I said my mom is
redoing the house in Minneapolis well
she's not redoing the whole house she's
just renovating the kitchen but anyway
here we just have like a little
stonework we have a fireplace we are
never here during the winter dive we're
really only here during the summer but
if you ever did come up during the
winter time you definitely could put
that on and then here my dad has some
books his lazy boy which he's obsessed
with I'm sure you know a lot of you guys
like lazy boys too we just have a nice
little lamp I love this little turtle
light here I remember this from my home
in Minneapolis when I was little and
then we just have some wood pieces here
you guys may have
my little I should you guys the upstairs
area of the Minneapolis home and you
guys probably saw a lot of like wood
pieces and antiques my mom loves that
kind of stuff so we did furnish this a
little bit of that way we have a TV
right there and then as you guys can see
those are the steps so it's nice so it's
just kind of small upstairs and you know
you have like the two bedrooms you come
down the steps and then this nice big
open living room which I really like I
like the way that this is kind of laid
out so there we have some couches of
course and my dad fits right there I sit
right there we've been watching The
Walking Dead here is Buster Brown Buster
is like a 17 year old old man aren't you
you're so sweet good boy he had a
hematoma in his ear about four months
ago and the cartilage actually broke so
one ear sticks up now and the other just
stays down and we take off his collar at
nighttime I don't know if you guys do
that with your dogs but here we just
have some little posters and then there
is a nice little bookcase with the other
couch here is Cinderella this into
really I think I told you guys
Cinderella is the cat that I found in
the dumpster when I was in ninth grade
in high school hello Cinderella and then
here we just have a nice dining room
table my dad just wanted something kind
of rustic and very simple obviously we
have these um interesting kind of little
light fixtures here these were from I
think my grandparents home they're like
crystal light fixtures so this kind of
does really it doesn't really fit in
here I guess you could say but I still
think it's pretty so anyways we have
those and then I really like this little
dining room table I love these kind of
stools sorry if you hear the squeaking
of the kitchen floor but I really like
these kind of stools we just like jump
up on them I'm here it's my Lilly
Pulitzer agenda and then my dad did a
puzzle the other night he loves doing
puzzles here we have the cat trees since
we have two cats visiting here and then
again the beautiful view of the lake mr.
woof you can't hear me anymore port baby
and then here we just have a nice little
kind of like bookshelf and just we keep
random stuff on here this is my dad's
little bonsai tree which he loves and
then in to the kitchen we go so my dad
did have this area renovated last summer
you know there's not really too much
like you don't really need to renovate
poppins if that makes sense because
they're just supposed to be kind of
rustic but the kitchen area really
didn't look very good when you first
bought the cabin so he did go ahead and
renovate last year we have cork floor
going on here which is actually really
soft and easy to walk on and then we
have more cat trees and cat scratchers
over here Cinderella actually bites that
and throws it off and bees it she's
really funny and here we just have you
know the kitchen counter this is all
wood so it's almost like a big chopping
block which is kind of awesome and that
job
hi i called him mr. lion doesn't he look
like a lion he's so cute anyway so yeah
that is what the kind of chopping block
looks like I love having just an island
where he literally can chop on it and
nothing gets damaged and that we do have
our refrigerator here just our kitchen
appliances over here and then one of the
things that I liked that my dad did when
he redesigned this kitchen was that he
wanted open cupboards so it's literally
like the pots and dishes and stuff like
that are all here and it's open and I
think it gives a really really kind of
fun different feel to everything because
you know it's a cabin and it's fun like
to have stuff like this out and
obviously like the house in Minneapolis
it's a little more I guess you could say
posh and my mom obviously has cabinets
and stuff I think this is really really
cute and he did some tiling in the back
as well and then here we have some more
cabins that you just kind of pull out
and then he also by the way that is
where another little castle um not the
cats sleep
goodness gracious they sleep with me is
where they go to the bathroom and where
they eat and things like that and then
here is the last little part I'm going
to show you guys here is also one of the
bathrooms that we renovated nobody has
really been in here yet because we still
have a few things to touch up we still
need to go ahead and put that mirror up
and just everything like that but this
is what the little bathroom in here
looks like if you guys saw my bathroom
tour at the house in Minneapolis that I
kind of showed you probably know where
we're getting this style from my mom
loves black-and-white everything so
anyway that is that little bathroom and
we are going to put you know
touches on maps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
