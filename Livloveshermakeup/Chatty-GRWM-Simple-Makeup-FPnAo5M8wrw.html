thank you for watching I am filming it
get ready with me video today which i
have not filmed 10 I mean no sense I
have not filmed it get ready with me
video probably like two or three months
which is crazy so um anyway ah so this
is going to be get ready with me I'm
just kind of in that mood today where I
cannot be bothered with like skincare
and tons of makeup so this is going to
be kind of a simple look and out so I'm
going to talk you guys through my
skincare this is my lazy day skincare
routine so anyway let's just get started
put my hair back you should read things
okay so the first thing I'm going to do
is cleanse my skin and this is what I do
when I am completely lazy and I just
can't be bothered to actually like wash
my face tone you know puts your mom put
moisturizer on I use micellar water
right now I'm using the simple cleansing
micellar water it's really nice i also
have used one from boots that was really
nice look at my hair look like a peacock
um and I am Oh in my back up what was I
gonna say yeah in my backup stash I have
a big like cleansing water from Sephora
waiting so I'm excited to try that one
too but I really do like this hair doe
whatever I'll do something with it later
but um so yeah so I really do like this
one from simple it's really nice so this
is what I do literally the only skincare
step I do when I cannot be bothered to
clean my face and you know put toner on
and see your omen okay guys I have to
fix this first I'm sorry you know a lot
of here like you play with your hair so
much in videos but I come I gotta fix
this this looks like a weird we just
can't I can't even okay there okay it is
what it is okay um but anyway so let's
get started so like I said I'm going to
use these simple cleansing micellar
water and I'm just going to use it on a
big cut around like this I don't know
what is on there it's like a little
green stain I'm going to use the other
side
so anyway I just kind of saturate most
of the pad with it because this is such
a big pad like a big disk a big pad
since weird a big disk that it can
actually like cover your whole face so I
like that because then i don't feel like
i'm using like 25 cotton balls um so I'm
just rubbing this all over and cleansing
my gaze even over my eyes it does remove
like traces of eye makeup that you might
have left over from the night before
let's be honest a lot of us get that it
just takes all the gunk and grime off
it's great if you just can't be bothered
on a certain day or if you just can't be
bothered at all ever maybe this is an
operatic for you to look into ok guys I
have to fix this again I'm so sorry but
this has got to be fixed let me just go
with a ponytail looking at myself in the
cameras thinking okay no no crazy ok so
now I have completely cleansed my face
with my micellar water i am going to
move on to my primers so i am going to
be using an eye primer and a face primer
like I said when I'm just like in a
hurry or if I really can't be bothered I
will just do that one skincare stuff so
just the micellar water so let's move on
to primers I am going to cry my face
with the l'oreal a youth code texture
Perfector poor Vanisher it's really nice
it kind of has like a consistency of
it's kind of like a thinner
Porefessional if you know that really
sell a pony feel from professional but I
mean from benefit the professional this
is like similar kind of looks similar to
but it's a little more like liquidy so
find that all over my face
is anybody else as pale as me that the
minute you start rubbing in even just a
primer your face turns bright red
pilgrim problems pale girl problems all
right so um now that i primed my face
I'm going to prime my eyelids and I'm
going to be using um habitants blow up
in here somewhere um the the bomb put a
lid on it eyelid primer I really really
like this it's really really silky it
doesn't dry out my eyelids I've really
been liking this to lately so just gonna
take a nice sized amount and put that on
my eyelids and if there is extra I will
um put it below if you see me looking
over here it's because my mirrors over
here I don't know what that is that was
my hickey you guys looks like a little
rash um so I'll pie the rest underneath
what is that it looks really horrible
can't be as horrible as this scratch I
got for my cat though the other day that
was pretty dad alright so now that I
have primed everything let me just make
sure this is completely soaked in ok now
that i have primed everything i'm just
going to go straight in to foundation I
just can't be bothered to you know be
working with concealer and correctors
today so just going straight into
foundation I'm going to be using the
Make Up For Ever HD foundation today and
if you're curious my shade is n 110 and
110 so I'm just going to pop this onto
the back of my hand maybe like four
pumps I'm so bad with you know face
makeup I always use too much but it's
just how i like it so I'm taking my
Sigma 3d HD kabuki and I'm just dipping
that and now i am working it onto my
face you can also just take it and like
that it's a little liquidy so maybe you
do want to do that oh yeah this was too
much it's ok like I said we're not using
concealer today so this will do ok I'm
just buffing that into my skin
this is an interesting color because
like it goes on looking like it's a
little too light but then it does
oxidize later and it actually leaves um
like a darker a darker tinge to my skin
so don't worry about it being too late
it actually will end up a little dark so
I'm putting that everywhere under my
eyes on my eyelids i'm not using
concealer just blending that cover that
thing up to what is that then you blend
blend into the hairline
okay and then I am going to just take um
sorry I am going to just take my fingers
and I like to just blot off the excess
makeup I have to take this that was just
following play um I just like to blot
off the excess makeup that like kind of
fills into my pores or fine lines so I'm
just going to take like my index finger
or my ring finger that's clean and just
kind of Pat over the areas like right
here and under the eyes in a little
right here just because sometimes i get
like um you know well I guess I do have
the beginnings of fine lines but um
sometimes it actually is like created
from the makeup like the makeup makes
fine lines like it's actually the makeup
that's like creasing into the skin so I
don't like that so I just like to take
off any excess alright moving on um I am
going to be setting this obviously a big
powder fanatic with my Revlon Colorstay
press powder in translucent it looks
like this as you guys can see I like
this a lot so I am just going to take
what what did I do hold on guys okay
imac i forgot to my power all right
you'll have to get it out look at all
these dirty makeup brushes I've took me
all of these disgusting yes i know this
is dirty but i did wash it the other day
that really shouldn't count because I'm
just sprinting bacteria but whatever
just do we can just look over that one
so I'm taking this little kabuki from
elf and going into the Revlon Colorstay
and just tapping that onto the skin kind
of pressing it in so that it is
completely setting the foundation
and then you want to blend into the
hairline the ears all that good stuff so
that you don't have any weird minds
powder everywhere um ok so we wipe off
my lips there's nothing more in the
world that I hate them makeup on my lips
unless it's of course a lip at um ok so
as you can see we have done the whole
face now it kind of evened out the skin
um it's just you know I didn't cover
everything I've like some acne scars
there and think if I didn't get covered
but that's ok now as you can tell we
look a little pale so we want to put
some blush on I'm going to be using the
hard candy glow all the way ombre baked
blush in 994 punch it's really beautiful
that's basically got like a built-in
highlighter so it's like you know like I
said I can't be bothered today with them
you know applying all that stuff so a
two and one is perfect so I'm just kind
of swirling it in don't worry I'm gonna
cap it off on this BH Cosmetics brush
you put this on the apples of my cheeks
and you can see the glow that's already
coming from that like you really don't
need a highlighter with this product
okay and I like to go back in with the
brush that I used to powder my face and
I like to just blot it over the blush
because i always am a little
heavy-handed with blush and i just want
to make sure there's no harsh lines ok
so now moving on we are going to go into
the eyes and i'm using this sephora
palette today this is the sand illusions
baked eyeshadow palette really really
cute i'm literally using one shade I
just you know I just want a little you
know color in my crease so I'm just
going to be taking that kind of peachy
shade right there and using a sigma
tapered blending efore t I'm just going
to blend that into my crease just so I
have a little dimension nothing to much
but you know it's nice
okay done with that um I am now little
blocks to your fill the stuff I picked
out so I'm going to use this eyeliner um
like I said I just want kind of simple
so I don't want to deal with like black
or brown eyeliner today because I always
have to touch that up I'm just going to
be using this tarina tarantino I dream
highlight hyper liner in broken doll
it's just like a silvery pink color and
it's nice on the waterline so it's going
to apply that on the waterline this kind
of gives a little bit without it being
like you know Oh stark white and then
I'm gonna like that tight line okay so
just give a little bit of something
without it being like you know okay so
next to you look and my little box I
want to go and and do my brows right now
just because I love this new brow
product look I'm using want to tell you
guys about it so it is the bhcosmetics
flawless brow pencil it has like a
little spooley on one end and then the
color on the other and it is a brow
pencil I actually prefer brow pencils /
powder over you know gel anything I just
find that it's the easiest to use and so
what I like to do is just spoil yup my
brows I find it so handy that you know
this bully is on the other end and then
just so you guys know my color is blonde
and it's really nice it's really
actually so I'm just going to start
working that in kind of towards the
front and just like really really small
feather-like strokes that's really one
of the only places i really want to fill
in and then I like to just occasionally
go back to the spoolie and kind of blend
it out it just kind of it's just like a
perfect match for my hair color and it's
so easy to use like it's never overdone
you know not like the honest
see you like dip brower you let put a
little on you're like wow that was not a
little so anyway canna comas that go and
it just kind of makes them a little
fuller towards the front which is what I
want so yeah yeah okay I am going to you
know what I'm going all backwards today
but I'm going to put my lip product on
my no lips already i'm going to be using
the pure minerals lip gloss stick in it
does not say or tickled it's like this
pretty kind of very basic kind of my
lips but better kind of deeper color
I just think it's very basic and neutral
and pretty alright so moving on we
should probably go back to the I since I
kind of just an all I'm going to be
doing now since I have a little color in
my crease I have a little brightness on
the waterline I'm just going to curl my
lashes and put some mascara on so I like
to count to 30 but I won't keep you guys
at long this time and I kind of clamp it
as I go I just sign it that like really
really keeps it curled and it doesn't
like crimp the lashes if that makes
sense nothing worse than putting it down
and then just getting like a crimped
flash alright and yeah the last thing
now is just a mascara I'm going to be
using the bare minerals lash domination
volumizing mascara today and I'm just
gonna like this like would be mascara
pull out a smaller mirror for this I
don't goof it all up we're just kind of
going for a light and natural today um I
normally like really really nice clumpy
lashes but I'm not going for that look
today
right and that's it guys I know this was
pretty quick well no it wasn't my god
i'm looking at the thing 18 minutes
cheese I can usually do a much better
makeup look but i feel like i was
talking so much so oh one more thing i
do want to set my makeup i'm going to be
using the smashbox photo finish primer
water to do that just piss that onto my
face it's become one of my favorite
setting sprays know it lasts forever too
um so i'll let that kind of set and then
i will show you guys the look that I
want not going to say the finished look
this is not a tutorial by any means this
is just kind of get ready with me this
is what I'm wearing today and this is
what you know what I'm going to do with
my hair yet but so yeah hold on it's
still still looked sure you guys are
wishing right now hmmm that I edited my
videos but no just gonna have to wait
well like that myself so anyway this is
the look um it's just really really
neutral I think it's cute with this
dress that I'm wearing it just all kind
of comes together i'll probably put some
major dry shampoo in my hair looks very
greasy um and then i'll just wear it
down again yeah so it's just very very
basic i think it was really really
pretty is that mascara already on the
top of my lid hold on man can you
believe it traveled up there already I
mean it's not the mouse carrots just
like if you have somewhat like meeting
them or longer lashes they just like hit
the top of good so we really really
annoying anyway so this is the look um
just one you know shadow in the crease a
little bit of brightness on the
waterline and really really pretty
shimmery blush that has like a built-in
highlighter and then just a neutral lips
so anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
get ready with me if you did get this
video thumbs up and I'll see you my next
