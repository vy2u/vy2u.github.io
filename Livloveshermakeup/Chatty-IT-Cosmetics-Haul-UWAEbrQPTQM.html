you so much for joining me i hope you
guys are having a really really good
weekend so far this video is going to be
a halt and i'm really excited for the
products that i picked up it is actually
it called medics hall and I really only
have or have owned two products from it
cosmetics the naturally pretty palette
which I love just the original one and
like the pink it's like an eyeshadow
palette comes in like pink like velvet
not bail of it I don't know it's like
pink packaging and it's like poofy like
it's squishy uh-huh anyway I really
really love that palette and I also had
the CC cream and actually it wasn't a
perfect color match for me unfortunately
so I did pass it along to a friend but
it was very very nice it was very like
hydrating it didn't irritate my skin and
um have really good coverage but it did
match her better so I pass that along to
her but anyway I picked up a few things
and I've been waiting on this because it
cosmetics it's a little pricey to be
completely honest um they are up there
in price they are like they are up there
uh-huh I think everything like in total
was like around one hundred thirty
dollars and I only got four things but
two of them are kids and I thought that
that was the best way to do it because
this time of years are coming out with
all of these great deals and things like
that and I wanted to try some other you
know like best selling products and you
can get them right now like in gift sets
so um but yeah it was quite pricey for
just you know like four items but I
think that that's kind of like a starter
you know and I can kind of see if I
really really like the brand or not I
know a lot of people love it cosmetics a
lot of the people that I watch love it
cosmetics here on YouTube so um I'm
really excited and I know that um I
think her name is Jamie the woman who
created a line and she really makes sure
that it's not just like makeup and
things that you're putting on your face
you it's also like anti-aging properties
it's like um skincare basically built
into your makeup so anyways the first
thing I got um was the it's cosmetics
feel the moment anti-aging ultra
hydrating sensory awakening primer serum
that is quite the mouthful I thought
this was going to be so much bigger I
think this was around fifty dollars you
guys and it seems really small however I
have heard that a little goes a very
long way with this product but um
let's see here it has caviar extract in
it hydrolyzed collagen peptides
hyaluronic acid argan oil vitamins a c
and e hoga avocado and deep ocean water
wow that sounds refreshing deep ocean
water plus balancing treatment essential
oils so it's your spa in a bottle for
instant hydration and sensory awakening
plus long-term clinically proven
anti-aging treatment benefits in one
apply / moisturizer or on to clean skin
before makeup for perfectly poreless
ultra hydrating airbrush skin results
wow that claims a lot but I have heard
good things about this products i'm sure
it is quite good um it says a small
amount is sufficient for your entire
face salads okay that it's a small
bottle because I guess that you only
need like one to two drops for your neck
your face and your decollete it says
allow one to two minutes to dry before
applying makeup for the ultimate spot in
a bottle balancing experience take
relaxing deep breath in during
application and feel the moment
experience experiencing the aromatics of
the essential oils as well as the
soothing and calming experience of
pampering your skin can also be worn as
your daily moisturizer over the top of
your night creams to maximize results
alright so this sounds like the most
perfect product in the world but we will
try it as a primer and I do have another
primer that's like a primer serum that I
really really like it's from NYX it's
called honey do me up and it's basically
like it's very soothing it feels really
nice on the skin and it's basically like
you're putting an extra layer of like
moisture on and just like benefiting
your skin if that makes sense like
putting good things on it but also
priming and it works really well I like
it um so hopefully I would like this too
and it seems like a little goes a long
way so I'm mostly going to use it as a
primer but I'm definitely going to do
that they that they said take a deep
breath in and experience this primer I
guess it smells good so yeah oh say
that's kind of cool I think that's why
it's called the sensory awakening so
maybe in the morning that will wake me
up so this is what it looks like and
should you get in here one fluid ounce
yeah so about fifty dollars for one
fluid ounce but
suppose elite last forever I'll let you
guys know but this is what it looks like
super super pretty little like pink jar
oh I love that and it comes with a
little pump or you can do the dropper so
they have a little dropper here I
actually really like droppers a lot of
people don't i do so i may use the
dropper um but overall I'm really really
excited let's go ahead and pump that on
the back of my hand so I can kind of
feel it I'm gonna do swatches and stuff
in this video to you guys because I
haven't even you know unpacked these
products Oh interesting okay so kind of
feels like jelly oh wow it does smell
good aromatherapy that actually just
called me down um smells really good
like essential oils but you guys can see
it's kind of leaving like a sheen on my
skin I probably put too much on I could
see why um that would be you know too
greasy for the whole face so that's why
they recommend like one or two pumps or
one or two drops depending on whatever
form you're using the dropper or the
pump but you felt really nice it didn't
feel like silicone e it didn't feel like
benefit Porefessional it feels more like
it feels slightly silicone and don't
know how to explain and I would feel
slightly silicone e but I don't know if
there's actually silicones in here I
feel like maybe there's not there could
be there's quite a long ingredient list
my goodness um there could be um so I'm
feeling a little bit of like slip you
know that kind of slip that you get from
a nice um you know like silicone kind of
primer which I love I love those kind of
primers um so yeah and even though I
just wiped it off my hand feels so soft
right now all right I'm really excited
for that because I'm all about skin care
to I love I think of myself as like
pampering myself a morning you know
every time I do my skincare routine in
the morning at night I'm just like well
this is great i love this it's like my
time alone and i don't know i really
like it so um this will make it even
better cuz it's a primer and will wake
me up and it's got you know anti-aging
Stefan
alright so that is the first thing again
I don't know I heard really really great
things it was very expensive but it was
one of their top like rated things and
also it's something I hear about a lot I
guess there is another one that comes in
like a clear container I don't know I
got this one because it said ultra
hydrating and I don't know if you're
trying to take care of your skin and you
don't want to wrinkle up you should just
keep it hydrated so that's the one I
picked the next thing I got was a little
lip set and I don't think I have any
lipsticks or any lip products from my
cosmetics seriously I think all i have
is that while i used to have the CC
cream and then the palette it's crazy
right so I've been took this little kid
I thought this was so cute it says it's
your perfect red lip it's got like cute
little sparkles on it you guys know how
I feel about shiny things and it is
limited edition and it is called the
your it girl lips perfect red lip duo it
includes the blurred lines smooth Phil
lipstick in it girl and bonus
travel-size y el bebe your lips Oh your
lips but better at waterproof lip liner
satin in cherry slush so this was I
don't know around like 20 or something
like that and I just thought it would be
a nice way to try out some of their lip
products and I love a red lip this time
of year and especially around Christmas
so I thought that this would be nice to
travel with for Christmas so um yeah
this is a full-size lipstick i believe
so it just comes in quizzical back to
its kind of like a your ad essence to it
can you guys see that kind of changes in
the light um but oh this is the color oh
that is like a beautiful true true red
let's go ahead and swatch that oh my
goodness it feels really creamy yeah
that is like a true red no orangie
undertone definitely a blue undertone so
that is what it looks like oh absolutely
gorgeous that went on really really
creamy too so yes i'll probably be
bringing this to my parents for i'll be
bringing it with me when I visit them
for Christmas alright and then you get
the so that is the full size of the
lipstick and then I guess the kind of
like holiday gift
I deal was that you also get like a
deluxe I sample of a matching gloss so
this is cherry flush y el bebe your lips
but better clinically clinically proven
and waterproof or it's not a glass I'm
sorry at the lip liner of course it's a
lip liner we don't want that running all
over the lips so that is what it looks
like and I've heard good things about it
cosmetic lip liners so let's see it's
got a nice little retractable thing oh
it's like a perfect color match nice
awesome those feel really creamy too
very very matte awesome that is going to
be a beautiful beautiful combination
right there i'm excited i'm going to
probably wear that on Christmas unless
of course I find a different one that I
want to wear but that looks really
really good and it seems like the two
shades are like you know they match
really well so sometimes it's hard like
i'll be putting on like a red lip or
something and i know i need to put a lip
liner on but like every time I go in
with a lip liner it doesn't match the
exact like undertone of the red and then
just ends up looking funky so I like
that those two are kind of like made for
each other alright moving on the next
thing I purchased was something that I
have heard so many people talk about it
is the it cosmetics Jamie current that's
her name by Jamie Curran bye bye pores
poreless finish HD micro powder with
hydro collagen silk and vitamins ka c
and e i have a lot of these kind of
powders i have the um let's see I have
like one from NYX I have like little
sample ones from Tarte I've used the one
from make up forever these are awesome I
really really like to do like the
buffing technique um if I have that
extra time in the morning and go over my
finished faced with you know like a
silica powder like this basically and
buff it in it just makes your skin look
airbrushed so um yeah this can I feel
like this like really small for the
price it was you know this is a husband
is a kind of pricey brand um but I've
heard such good things and I just
thought you know what I have to try it
out so it is translucent um but it looks
like it has kind of like a yellowy
undertone hopefully that won't be an
issue um but yeah poreless finished
Steve micro powder I'm not going to open
it because it'll probably explode all
over the place but that's what it looks
like and it's definitely not as big as
like the one you can get from ELF which
is a great deal and works really well or
the one from NYX but um if it's as good
as everybody says then I only need a
little bit that's like what I'm noticing
with this brand everybody talks about
how you only need like a small amount of
you know product for everything so we
shall see and then the last thing i got
this was what i was so excited about
this was the $28 uh your gymnastic gua i
thought it was just an engine issaquah
you were oh I guess oh it's cute okay so
it's like a little Christmas packaging
like I'm supposed to give this to
somebody but I'm keeping it for myself I
give it to me um it is a 28 dollar value
or twenty eight dollars and it is a 44
dollar value you get a I believe full
size of the vitality lip flush yes
includes vitality lip flush foreign one
Reviver lipstick stain and vitality lip
blush hydrating glossing engine issaquah
this is limited edition it has this
little thing up here where you can write
like to and from to Olivia from Olivia
um and it's super super cute and i have
heard amazing things about this I love
products similar to this the first one
that I've tried and actually the only
one that I really tried is the one from
elf the lip glow and I'm obsessed with
it it is so awesome it takes on um like
a different tone on everybody basically
like the pH or like they say it's the pH
but really it's like however warm your
lips are things like that it just it's a
different color on everybody it's really
cool so I've heard that this is
basically like the same thing but better
who knows if it's actually better but I
wanted to try it out and I thought it
was a good deal because um I believe
both of these are full-size so that is
the packaging super cute packaging this
is what started this hall I put this in
my basket and then I was like you know
what I gotta get some more stuff I'm
just gonna try try out is it cosmetics
now just have to do that so alright this
is so cute you guys look at this it's
like nice it feels like leather even
though it's not but I'm super super cute
there's no sick one mmm
and so you get that cute little zippered
pouch I'm excited and then um this is of
the wrapping feel like I'm opening a
gift I'm glad I saved this is all right
so yes so these are full-size which i
think is a good deal when it comes to it
cosmetics because it seems like like I
said I know I keep saying it but they
are a little pricey so it seems like
this is a good deal and honestly
everybody raves about this particular
product and in there you could sample oh
oh the bye bye under eye that was in my
basket and then I put it back but I'm
going to try this I think this is the
waterproof anti-aging concealer I've
heard amazing things about that too oh
and here's the other it cosmetics number
50 serum collagen veil so that is the
sister to the little pink one I think I
just got that one because it was pink
but also it said ultra hydrating but
mostly because it was pink this one was
just clear and I don't know serum
collagen veil hydrating anti-aging
peptides essential it seems like they're
they're similar um but the pink bottle
really just you know it had me so anyway
I will be able to try that one out to
you that's fun and then and it cosmetics
this is the CC plus cream this is a
medium that is going to be too dark for
me but I already know that this is a
very nice product alright so okay so
here's the this is called the vitality
glossy stain indigenous acquah and this
is what the packaging looks like so
pretty i love this packaging I love pink
alright so we open it up and you get a
nice little doe foot applicator and I
know that this is probably not going to
show up because if it is what everybody
says it is it like changes depending
like you know on the warmth of your body
or the warmth of your lips or skin or
whatever so it may take a few moments to
kind of heat up but really really pretty
it seems like this is going to be
similar to the elf lip glow I love that
one so I think I'm really going to
this and i love that this like a little
glossy stain does this actually stay in
the lips awesome awesome that you get a
full-size this is probably the best deal
that I got um and then the vitality lip
flush engine issaquah really cute
packaging a little pink ring around it
and it literally looks like it's clear
and it says live love laugh with
vitality mmm so cute all right so that's
what it looks like i am love this
packaging i really do let's squash that
next to the to the lip stain so it's not
a glass it's like a stain I like that I
like lip stains a lot all right so this
is the slush this kind of like a I would
categorize it as like a kind of lip balm
sort of thing it feels very very smooth
on the skin and then um the other one
feels more like aid gloss but not super
sticky a little more like hydrating so
definitely yeah interesting and I guess
it does leave a stain so anyway the two
of those combined are going to be
gorgeous i'm really really excited to
play with these i am probably going to
be wearing those next week probably cuz
i am the most excited about those so
anyway on that was my little a cosmetics
holiday hall I just thought it would be
best for me to take these items up while
I could get like more from a money I
don't know um it just seems like it
cosmetics is up there in price tonight
like literally like if it if they didn't
have any simple like holiday kids like I
would have put two things in my basket
and that would have gone over a hundred
dollars so anyway um I'm excited to try
to stuff out I feel like I got a nice
little arrangement of things I tried not
to overlap with things that I already
kind of have in that category like the
eyeshadow palette and the CC cream so
now we have a primer the setting powder
or the bye bye pores um and then two
little lip kits so I guess we shall see
I will do a follow-up all for you guys
next week and yeah thank you so much for
joining me bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
