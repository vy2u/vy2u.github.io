welcome back to shop and swatch my stash
where I share with you guys the makeup
products I currently have on my face and
of course the makeup products I will be
using this week I am finally back I am
sorry that I took a leave off of YouTube
for about a week I'm feeling a hundred
percent better now so thank you for all
of the love and support on my last video
what else did I want to say oh yeah
we're still a little tilted this way
today because I just can't get Belle up
on the wall you guys I don't know what's
going on I told you guys that she had a
little fall I'm she had a big fall like
I heard her go smack him down in the
middle of the night I was like what the
hell was that she had quite the fall and
we honestly we don't like do a lot of
nails in our wall because our building
has told us that we'll have to pay for
that after we leave which i think is
kind of ridiculous so we do a lot of
those like sticky tacky things that have
like a double sided tape where you take
them down from the wall and it doesn't
rip any of like the wall off or the
paint off and I just can't get her back
up on the wall so please let me know if
you have any recommendations on how to
get her back up because she just does
not want to go back up but yeah that is
pretty much it I'm so excited to be back
and I'm not gonna just sit here and go
that's not for like ten minutes so let's
just get into the video alright the
first two items that I will be using on
my face this week are these primers
right here so the first one is the
benefit Air Patrol BB eyelid a primer
this is what it looks like I really like
this because it does cancel out blue
tones and it is quite moisturizing and
humectant around the eye area and then
as my face base I will be using the
vitamin enriched face base from Bobbi
Brown I've been really obsessed with
this lately I know that this is not
cruelty free I do want to find a cruelty
free alternative for this product but it
smells really good I like that it's not
too silicone based but it's also not too
hydrating or mattifying it's just right
in between so that is what I will be
using as my face primer I also will be
going in with something a little special
this week now I am taking extra
precautions because I will be using a
foundation that honestly did not work
out for me the first time I used it so
after I put on my primers I want to go
in with this milk of makeup sunshine oil
I purchased this in one of my Sephora
favorites kits that I got during in the
spring time and basically it's just an
oil that you roll onto your face I know
it's not super sanitary but you roll it
onto your face it gives a little bit of
a sheen it has a little bit of shimmer
to it but also it is quite hydrating and
smells exactly like the bobbi brown
vitamin-enriched facespace they both
smell like lemon so obviously you can't
see anything but this is just gonna be
something that's gonna give me a little
bit of extra moisture throughout the day
and I do feel like I need that the
reason why I need that is because I am
using the it cosmetics your skin but
better CC illumination full-coverage
cream this week I am a true believer
that you need to use a product multiple
times before giving in like honest
opinion on it and although I did a first
impressions on this and absolutely it
looks like on my face after about
six to eight hours I still believe that
you should try it again so I will link
the first impressions on this down below
if you want to see how bad it looks just
honestly it was just very glittery on my
face it really made me dry around the
outer perimeter of my face I was
honestly kind of amazed at how drying
this looked on my skin but I thought
with the extra products kind of mixed in
there the sunshine oil and that more
hydrating and not so much hydrating but
in between kind of face space this would
work a lot better and today I did only
apply one pump of it and I applied it
with my fingertips like a lot of you
recommended you are completely right
when I first did the first impressions
honestly I put on like two or three
pumps because I really wanted to see if
it would build less is more with this so
thank you so much to all of you who
recommended and just applying it with
your fingertips and only applying one
pump I think it looks a lot better on my
skin as of right now so I do wear the
shade fair and that is what I will be
using as my base this week and then I do
want to go in with a concealer and I
decided to reach for the chart
rainforest of the sea aqua sealer I also
wear the shade fair in this one this is
one of my all-time favorite concealers
it's very light weight I felt like it
would blend in nicely with that CC cream
so we are going to pair the two of those
together as far as powder is concerned I
will be setting everything in with my
Catrice cosmetics prime and fine
mattifying powder this is in the
transparent or translucent version I
have hit pan on this recently it's not
my all-time favorite powder it's not
something that I would repurchase but I
do think it does a nice job it's
upsetting in like your t-zone or any
area that you are oily so I would be
using that and then I will be using a
finishing powder as well just to kind of
give an overall nice the kind of
appearance to my skin so I will be using
the by Thierry hyaluronic hydra powder
which was sent to me in exchange for an
honest review from the by terry brand as
well as octa lee so i will be using that
with more of a fluffy brush to go over
my whole entire face
as far as blush is concerned I am going
to be using my - Physicians Formula
blushes and I'm gonna layer them
together so these are the murumuru
butter blushes honestly I hate the way
both of these look on my skin by
themselves this part this particular
shade right here this particular shape
right here which is called plum Rhodes
it's a little too cool toned on my skin
even though I do have a very very cool
undertone for some reason this just
doesn't look good on my skin and then
the other one which is called natural
glow honestly is like a highlight on my
skin and I'm pretty fair complected so I
just don't think that these look good by
themselves however I thought this week I
could layer them together so I am
wearing palm rose today and then I put
natural glow on top I will go ahead and
swatch these for you guys here is the
sheet of Plum rose and putting natural
glow on top I actually thought it looked
really really good so here they are
together that did not go on very well
because I have oil on that hand let's
swatch it on the other side so here is
the shade of Plum Grove it's a very very
kind of barely there sort of blush color
and then the shade natural glow which
has a little more of like a peachy
iridescent to it I just layered that
right on top and I honestly really kind
of like the way they look together so on
top we have the plum rose and then there
is the natural glow shade so anyway I
will be layering the two of those
blushes together this weeks I do think
the C natural glow gives just a little
bit of umph to the cheeks as well so
they look pretty layered together who
would have known all right and then as
far as highlight is concerned I will be
using my makeup revolution yeah vivid
baked highlighter in the shade golden
lights I love this I wasn't a huge fan
of pink lights or peach lights I felt
like the formula on the two of those
were different than this one but this
one is highly highly pigmented you guys
I mean I just applied the smallest
amount today and I really feel like I
have quite a glow going on so this is
what it looks like the best part about
this is that it is literally like $4.99
at Ulta and look at that do you guys see
that the pigment is insane so I thought
I would reach for this guy this week
there is a one swipe swatch it
definitely has a beautiful beautiful
kind of opalescent and golden undertone
going on there with a bit of a white
base and I do feel like it is a true
highlight on my skin it's not darker
than my complexion and it doesn't darken
up when I kind of tailed my head a
different direction so that is beautiful
very excited to use that and then I will
be playing with
I shadow this week I have a new palette
that I will be going ahead and reviewing
for you guys probably on Thursday but as
of right now just because I do have a
super super busy week if you didn't know
Tom and I are going to Hawaii in ten
days so I'm working like overtime this
whole entire week I thought I would just
use like a one single eyeshadow to put
on the inner corner of my eyes and just
put on eyeliner and mascara so this is
from Physicians Formula this is called
the eye brightener natural eye light I'm
single
this would be worse packaging I have
ever seen I mean honestly when I see
this in my collection I'm like I don't
want to reach for that but this is what
it looks like I have had this for years
and years and years guys it has not gone
bad but honestly it really is beautiful
you can use it as a highlight you can
use it on the inner corner of your eye
which I did today or you can just put it
all over your lid it just gives a really
really nice kind of reflective look and
it really brightens things up so if you
have been sick or you are sick I feel
like that's really helpful sometimes
when I'm sick and I try and put on like
a bunch of eyeshadows it just looks
really muddy and it makes my eyes look
even more sick so I just feel like
that's a nice way to kind of open your
eyes up and it's just it's pretty it
works really well I do like it all right
as far as mascara is concerned I will be
using my miss manga Rach mascara I love
the wand on this I love this mascara
they just continued it and I wouldn't
repurchase it anyway because L'Oreal
tests on animals but that is what the
wand looks like let me know if you've
ever seen another mascara that has a
wand similar to this the formulation is
trying to get really glumpy and clumpy
I'm gonna have to toss it after this
week but hey I love clumpy eyelashes so
it still works for me and then I will be
sticking with the Revlon Colorstay brow
pencil in the shade 2:05 blonde this
week you guys know I've been obsessed
with this lately I love what it does for
my eyebrows I don't have perfect
eyebrows I don't really spend a lot of
time on my eyebrows but you do have the
spoolie on this side so you can comb
them out quickly and then on this side
you have that kind of like triangular
shaped a brow pencil so that is what I
will be using in my brows this week as
far as I'm lips are concerned you're
probably wondering what is on my lips
right now I hope it still looks okay and
this is from colour-pop it is called the
ultra metallic lip in the shade fritter
can we just take a moment look at that
isn't that beautiful I mean the
iridescent the way that this looks I
love it so I don't absolutely adore the
formulation on the
Kollek lips I do actually both of these
i don't adore the formulation this one
goes outside of the lip line this is one
of the glossy lips and then this one
over here is really really drying in my
opinion but the shade is just so
gorgeous and I don't have anything like
this in my collection so I thought I
would play with that this week so there
is the shade of fritter this is one of
the ultra metallic lips this is from
colour-pop and then the other one is the
ultra glossy lip and I wore this on
Sunday last Sunday and a lot of you were
telling me you were like whoa your lip
line it's like crazy-looking this goes
this seeps outside of the lip line like
crazy so the shade is called cheatcode
which is a beautiful beautiful kind of
copper color and I used to have another
one of these and then another one of the
metallic lips as well but I decluttered
the other two I think I had zebra and
then some other shade but I just kept
these because although I'm not obsessed
with the formulation these are very very
unique colors so there is cheat code
just a really beautiful kind of coppery
color and it is quite comfortable on the
lips it feels like a really nice
pigmented kind of creamy lip gloss but
you have to be very very careful with
how much of this you apply so I will be
rained that on my lips and then as far
as eyeliner is concerned I thought I
would just go with one of my Urban Decay
24/7 glide-on eye pencils I chose stag
this week which is a nice cool tone
brown color and it's just a really
really nice color has a little bit of
almost like a purpley depth to it do you
guys see that so that is what I will be
wearing for eyeliner alright I do have a
few items here as well that were sent to
me in exchange for an honest review from
octa Lee and the brand's themselves so
I'm going to be trying out this little
guy right here this is the skin to Navy
'post and makeup recovery spray it does
say that it's supposed to gently clear
pores and help prevent breakouts now
this is something that you want to use
after you take off your makeup I've used
it the other night I did not notice a
single difference you guys I did not
notice that this gave me more hydration
I didn't feel like it helped with
breakout - whatsoever so I'm actually
gonna use this as a setting spray this
week I used it today and I felt pretty
good so I'm going to be playing with
that guy and then also lip smacker this
is adorable lip smackers sent me these
little guys so I want to pair the ultra
glossy lip in the shade cheek code with
these guys this week if you didn't know
I do a series on my channel it's not a
super popular series but I love the
series it is called teatime would live
where I talk about my tea favorites for
the month so lip smacker release
this coffee and tea flavored set now I
do think lip smackers are good if you
have watched my 2016 lip balm you know
collection video I'll link it down below
I talk about lip smackers a lot I feel
like they are very underrated but they
taste good they work relatively well and
I never seem to have an issue with them
rubbing off on my flute head joint so I
will be playing with these this week
I've only tried two of them so far the
first one is called pumpkin spice latte
it looks a little something alike in
this and then this one right here is
called a cinnamon chai latte so those
are the two that I have personally tried
but they have so many flavors in here
like mocha frappe they have mandarin
mint tea they have watermelon lemonade
tea pomegranate tea it's just adorable
and right up my alley so when they
contacted me on octoly I was like yes
please send me that so I will be playing
with those and then finally also I have
this little guy here so I talked about
this on my snapchat probably about two
weeks ago this is the by Terry Baume De
Rose and I am wearing it today paired
together with the ultra metallic lip so
like I said not the biggest fan of this
formulation I do find it quite drying
I've been wearing it for about an hour
and a half I don't know how it looks
right now but it feels pretty good on my
lips I put this on today before this
this is basically just the same exact
thing as the Dior creme de Rose lip balm
however this is in like a lip gloss tube
so I think it's pretty awesome I really
do enjoy that this is what it looks like
and by Terry is a cruelty free brand so
if there is some sort of a rose lip balm
that I will be repurchasing it will be
from by terry so anyway guys that is it
those are all the items that I am going
to use for shop my stash this week I
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for joining me and I will
see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
