welcome back gift shop and swatch my
facts where I should would you guys be
makeup products that currently have on
my face and of course the makeup product
i will be using this week i am finally
back i am sorry that I took a leave off
of youtube for about a week until eight
one hundred percent better now so thank
you for all of you love and support on
my last video what else do they want to
say oh yeah we're still a little tilted
this way today because I just can't get
fell upon the wall you guys I don't know
what's going on I told you guys that she
had a little fall I'm she had a big fall
like I heard her both macking down in
the middle of the night out like what
the hell was that she has like a ball
and we honestly we don't like to do a
lot of nails in our wall because our
building has told us that will have to
pay for that after we leave which i
think is kind of ridiculous so we do a
lot of those like sticky tacky things
that have like a double-sided tape where
you take them down from the wall and it
doesn't rip any of like the wall off or
the paint off and I just can't get her
back up on the wall so please let me
know if you have any recommendations
about how to get her back up because she
just does not want to go back up but
yeah that is pretty much it i'm so
excited to be back and I'm not going to
just sit here and go that is not for
like 10 minutes so let's get into the
video alright the first few items i will
be using on my face this week are these
primers right here so the first one is
the benefit Air Patrol BB i laid a
primer this is what it looks like i
really like this because it does cancel
out blue tones and it is quite
moisturizing and humectants around the
eye area and then as my face base i will
be using the vitamin enriched face base
from Bobbi Brown I've been really
obsessed with this lately I know that
this is not cruelty free if you want to
find a cruelty-free alternative for this
product but it smells really good I like
that it's not too silicon-based but it's
also not too hydrating or mattifying
it's just right in between so that is
what i will be using as my face primer i
also will be going in or something a
little special this week now i am taking
extra precautions because i will be
using a foundation that honestly did not
work out for me the first time i used it
so after i put on my primers i want to
go in with this milkha make up sunshine
oil i purchased this in one of my
sephora favorites kits that I got during
in the springtime and basically it's
just an oil that you roll onto your face
I know it's not super sanitary but you
roll it onto your face it gives a little
bit of a sheen it has a little bit of
shimmer to it but also it is quite
hydrating and it smell
exactly like see Bobby Brown vitamin in
first grade space they both smell like
lemon so obviously you can't see
anything but this is just going to be
something that's going to give me a
little bit of extra moisture throughout
the day and I do feel like I need that
the reason why I need that is because I
am using the it cosmetics your skin but
better CC illumination full coverage
cream this week I am a true believer
that you need to use a product multiple
times before giving in like honest
opinion on it and although i did a first
impressions on this and absolutely it
look like on my face after about
six to eight hours i still believe that
you should try it again so i will link
the first impressions on this down below
if you want to see how bad it looks kids
honestly it was very glittery on my face
it really made me dry around the outer
perimeter of my face I was honestly kind
of amazed at how drying this looked on
my skin but I thought with the extra
product kind of mixed in there the
sunshine oil and what more hydrating not
so much hydrating but in between kind of
space base this would work a lot better
and today I did only apply one pump of
it and I applied it with my finger tips
like a lot of you recommended you are
completely right when I first did the
first impressions honestly I put on like
two or three pumps because I really
wanted to see if it would build less is
more with this they'll thank you so much
to all of you who recommended and just
applying it with your fingertips and
only applying one pump I think it looks
a lot better on my skin as of right now
so I can wear these shapes there and
that is what i will be using as my face
this week and then i do want to go in
with a concealer and i decided to reach
for the charts rainforest of DC aqua
sealer i also where the shade fair in
this one this is one of my all-time
favorite concealer it's very lightweight
i felt like it would blend in nicely
with that CC cream so we are going to
pair the two of those together as far as
powder is concerned i will be setting
everything in with my Catrice cosmetics
prime and find mattifying powder this is
a neat transparent or translucent
version i have hit pan on this recently
it's not my all-time favorite powder
it's not something that I would
repurchase but I do think it does a nice
job of setting in like your t-zone or
any area that you are oily so i will be
using that and then i will be using a
finishing powder as well just to kind of
give an overall nice to kind of
appearance to my skin so i will be using
b5 Terry hyaluronic hydra powder which
were sent to me in exchange for an
honest review from the by Carrie brand
as well as octal e so i will be using
that with more of a fluffy brush to go
over my whole entire face
as far as bluff is concerned I am going
to be using my two physicians formula
blushes and I'm going to layer them
together so these are the murumuru
butter blushes honestly I hate the way
both of these look on my skin by
themselves this part is that this
particular shade right here this
particular name right here which is
called plum rose is a little bit cool
toned on my skin even though I do have a
very very cool undertone for some reason
this just doesn't look good on my skin
and then the other one which is called
natural glow unexplainably not highlight
on my skin and I'm pretty fair
complected so I just don't think that
these look good by themselves however I
thought this week I could layer them
together so I am wearing plum rose today
and then I put natural glow on top I
will go ahead and swatch these for you
guys and here is the sheet plum road and
at putting natural glow on top I
actually thought it looked really really
good so here they are together that did
not go on very well because I have oil
on that hand let's watch it on the other
side so here is the shade of plum road
it's a very very kind of barely there
sort of blush color and then the shade
at natural glow which has a little more
of like a peachy iridescent to it I just
layer that right on top and I honestly
really kind of like the way they look
together so on top what we have a deep
plum rose and then there is the natural
glow shade so anyway I will be layering
the two of those lushes together this
week I do you think the C natural glow
gives just a little bit of loops to the
cheeks as well so it looks pretty
layered together who would've known
alright and then as far as highway is
concerned i will be using my makeup
revolution yeah this is baked high later
in the shade golden lights I love this I
wasn't a huge fan of pink light or peach
life I felt like the formula on the two
of those were different than this one
but this one is highly highly pigmented
you guys I mean I just applied the
smallest amount today and I really feel
like I have quite a glow going on so
this is what it looks like the best part
about this is that it is literally like
four dollars and ninety-nine cents at
Ulta and look at that so you see that
the payment is in the same so I thought
I would reach for this guy this week
there is the one swipes watch it
definitely has a beautiful beautiful
kind of opalescent golden undertone
going on there with a bit of a white
base and I do you feel like it isn't
true highlight on my skin asan darker
than my compression and it doesn't
darken up when I kind of killed my head
a different direction so that is
beautiful very excited to use that and
then I won't
I shadow this week I've a new palette
that i will be going ahead and reviewing
for you guys probably on Thursday but as
of right now just because I do have a
super super busy week if you didn't know
Tom and I are going to Hawaii in 10 days
so I'm working like overtime this whole
entire week I thought I would just use
like a one single eyeshadow to put on
the inner corner of my eyes and just put
on eyeliner and mascara so this is from
physicians formula this is called the
eye brightener natural I light single
this might be worth packaging i have
ever seen i mean honestly when I see
this in my collection I'm like I don't
want to reach for that but this is what
it looks like i have had this for years
and years and years guys it has not gone
bad but honestly it really is beautiful
you can use it as a highlight you can
use it on the inner corner of your eye
which i did today or you can just put it
all over your lid it just gives a really
really nice kind of reflective look and
it really brighten things up so if you
have been sick or you are sick I feel
like that's really helpful sometimes
when I'm six and I try and put on like a
bunch of eyeshadows it just looks really
muddy and it makes my eyes look even
more sick so I just feel like that's a
nice way to kind of open your eyes up
and it's pretty it works really well I
do like it all right as far as mascara
is concerned i will be using my miss
manga rock mascara i love the wand on
this i love this mascara they just
continued it and i wouldn't repurchase
it anyway because l'oreal test on
animals so that is what they want to
look like let me know if you've ever
seen another mascara that has a wand
similar to this the formulation is going
to get really clumpy and clumpy i'm
going to have to top it after this week
but hey i love pompeii lashes so it's
the worse for me and then i will be
sticking with the revlon colorstay brow
pencil and you see 205 belongs to
sweetie there's no I've been obsessed
with this lately I love what it does for
my eyebrows I don't have perfect
eyebrows I don't really spend a lot of
time on my eyebrows but you do have a
spoolie on this side so you can comb
them out quickly and then on this side
you have that kind of like triangular
shaped a brow pencil so that is what i
will be using in my brows this week as
far as lists are concerned you're
probably wondering what is on my list
right now i hope it still looks okay
this is from colour-pop it is called the
ultra metallic lip in shade fritter can
we just take a moment look at that it's
not beautiful I mean iridescent the way
does this looks I love it so I don't
absolutely adore the formulation on a
beat
Kallis lips I do actually both of these
I don't adore the formulation this one
goes outside of the lip line this is one
of the glossy lips and then this one
over here is really really drying in my
opinion but the shade is just so
gorgeous and I don't have anything like
this in my collection so I thought I
would play with that this week so there
is the shade of fritters this is one of
the ultra metallic lips this is from
colour-pop and the other one is the
ultra glossy lip and I wore this on
sunday last sunday in a lot of you were
telling me you were like whoa your lip
line is like crazy looking this goes
this seats outside as a lip line like
crazy so the sheet is called cheat code
which is beautiful beautiful kind of
copper color and I used to have another
one of these and then another one of the
metallic lips as well that I decluttered
the other two I think I had zebra and
then some other shade but I just kept
these because although i'm not obsessed
with the formulation these are very very
unique colors so there is cheat code
just a really beautiful kind of coppery
color and it is quite comfortable on the
lips it feels like a really nice
pigmented kind of creamy lip gloss but
you have to be very very careful with
how much of this you apply so I will be
right back on my list and then as far as
eyeliner is concerned I thought I would
just go with one of my Urban Decay 24-7
glide on eye pencils I chose stag this
week which is a nice cool tone brown
color and it's just a really really nice
color has a little bit of almost like a
purpley yes to it you guys see that so
that is what I will be wearing for
eyeliner all right I do have a few items
here as well that were sent to me in
exchange for an honest review from
octave Lee and the brand's themselves so
I'm going to be trying out this little
guy right here this is the skin to media
post makeup recovery spray it doesn't go
to spoke to gently clear pores and help
prevent breakouts now this is something
that you want to use action you take off
your makeup I used it the other night I
did not notice a single difference you
guys I did not notice that this gave me
more hydration I didn't elect helps with
breakouts whatsoever so I'm actually
going to use this as a setting spray
this week I used it today and I felt
pretty good so I'm going to be playing
with that guy and then also lip smacker
adorable lip smackers sent me v zilla
guys so I want to pair the ultra glossy
lip initiate cheat code with these guys
this week if you didn't know I do a
series on my channel it's on a super
popular series but I love the series in
a cold tea time would live where I talk
about my cheap favorites for the month
so let's make her release this coffee
and tea flavored
now i do think lip smackers are good if
you have watched my 2016 lip balm you
know collection video I'll link it down
below I talked about lip smackers a lot
I feel like they are very underrated but
they taste good if they work relatively
well and I never seem to have an issue
with them rubbing off on my flute head
joy so i will be playing with these this
week i only tried two of them so far the
first one is called pumpkin spice latte
it looks a little something like this
and then this one a trace here is called
a cinnamon chai latte so those are the
two that i have personally tried but
they have so many flavors in here like
mocha frappe they have mandarin mint tea
they have watermelon lemonade tea
pomegranate tea it's just adorable and
right up my alley so when they contacted
me on our soil is like yes please send
me bad so i will be playing with those
and then finally also i have this little
guy here so i talked about this on my
snapchat probably about two weeks ago
this is the bike carry bombs rose and i
am wearing it today appeared together
with the ultra macaela clip so like I
said not the biggest fan of this
formulation I do find it quite Brian
I've been wearing it for about an hour
and a half I don't know how it looks
right now but it feels pretty good on my
lips I put this on today before this
this is basically just the same exact
thing as the door creme de rose lip balm
however this is in like a lip gloss tube
so I think it's pretty awesome I really
do enjoy that this is what it looks like
and by Terry is a cruelty-free brand so
if there is some sort of a rose lip balm
that I will be repurchasing it would be
from by Terry so anyway guys that is it
those are all the items that I am going
to use for shot my stash this week I
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for joining me and I will
see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
