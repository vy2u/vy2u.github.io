channel thank you so much for joining me
in this video I am showing you guys how
to do with this eye look or this
tutorial whatever um
I thought it would just take a little
less time if I went ahead and just did
one eye first because I am using a
palette that is very very hard to blend
so this is the visor cool mask palette
and I recently did a collab here on
youtube with my friend Amy and she
talked about the dark mattes and I have
the cool mask but we did reviews and
swatches on these particular pallets so
if you guys would like to see that video
I'll link it below but in that video I
was wearing this I look and I asked you
guys if you would like to see a tutorial
or a demo on it and a lot of you said
yes so that is what we were doing so
let's just get started the first thing
I'm going to do is prime my eyes with
this particular eye primer and it is the
elf sorry it's kind of early in the
morning I'm like oh it is the elf eyelid
primer in the shade sheer this is what
it looks like and I'm just going to put
that all over MA all the way from my lid
up to my brow bone just like that and
then I'm going to blend it in with some
lucky that it is Valentine's Day today
how are you guys doing if you don't have
a Valentine
I am your Valentine okay you do have a
Valentine I'm right here my boyfriend is
actually away he is that a radiologist
conference in DC so he's not even here
for Valentine's Day but he sent me some
really really sweet things he's so
adorable I love him anyway I'm just
tapping and patting that in I like it
because it's a nice kind of tacky base
and then the next thing I'm going to do
is go in with my wet and wild color icon
single in the shade Brule and I'm gonna
take a sigma e40 brush I'm gonna tip
that in there and I'm going to put this
all over my lid all the way under my lid
all over my eye pretty much I like this
because it's just a beautiful kind of
neutral color that really really
brightens up the eye area no matter what
like color skin you have it's really
fantastic I should probably call this
they get ready with me it's a little
more casual but I feel like any time I
do something on my channel like if I do
a tutorial
I call it tutorial because it's a look
I've done before whereas it get ready
with me it's usually just a look that I
haven't done before I'm literally just
doing it on camera with you guys for the
first time so that's my color tutorial
but I guess this is a chatty tutorial
alright the next thing I'm going to do
is go in with my eyeliner and I am using
it the Makeup Forever aqua eyes in the
shade of black and I'm just going to
line my waterline and on my tight line I
like this because it does last all day
I'm just trying to use this little thing
on because all that's left is a little
stub um and I really do like it I don't
like it as much as like my Urban Decay
24/7 glide-on eye pencils I just feel
like it's not as pigmented and I can't
get it on as quickly it's like a little
stiff like it's a soft pencil but it's
just I don't know it's a little stiff um
but I want to use it up because it's so
small you know might as well right just
once I have that on my waterline and my
tight line I'm going to go ahead and
we're just gonna get into our shadows so
here is what the palette looks like I'm
gonna give you guys a closer look
because it really eats pretty it's a
pretty palette but if you guys saw the
video on the collab I basically talked a
little bit in depth on how it's just
hard to blend and I like this I look
that I created I think it's pretty it's
very eye opening but still smoky but at
the same time it's just your this is
gonna take a while so just be prepared
so the first thing I'm going to do is go
into this shade right here and I'm going
to be taking another sigma tapered
blending e-40 brush this is a different
one I'm going into that shade right
there and I'm gonna put this into my
crease as my transition shade I'm just
using a back-and-forth windshield Swiper
wipers wiper motions whatever you want
to call it just so that we have a little
bit of color deposited in the crease so
that it's easier to blend out not saying
that this palette is easy to blend but
anything to make it easier to blend that
is good alright the next thing I'm gonna
do is go in with my morphe what
these m-44 one brush and I'm going to go
right into that purple shade and we're
going to take that tap off the excess
and start putting that into our crease
and I like this brush it's very similar
to the Sigma e35 but it's a little more
dense so I'm kind of going all the way
down to my lid area and I'm just kind of
going back and forth we're just kind of
depositing color and I'm doing it rather
quickly because I want to blend this out
before it kind of sets into the eye
primer I know that sounds weird but if
you've worked with one of these palettes
you probably know what I'm talking about
so I'm going all over the lid and into
the crease just back and forth motions
just like that and then I'm going to go
into a clingy 40 brush and I'm just
going to use circular motions and blend
that out sorry wasn't looking in the
lens I'm holding this little mirror up I
still need to find a way to put like a
mirror in front of me just cuz it's kind
of hard to be holding and doing a look
at the same time but I just realized I
was looking into the viewfinder I got a
stuff doing that alright here I am
looking at the lens now think I'll end
up calling this chatty tutorial it's a
little more get ready with me style so
I'm just doing kind of back and forth
motion circular motions whatever I can
do to not get a super harsh line with
that look basically alright the next
thing I'm going to do is take my morphe
I'm sorry this is my crown brushes see
three-30 problem increase brush and I'm
going to go into this darker kind of
slate gray color in the palette right
there and I'm going to go ahead and put
this on my outer V so I'm just going to
place it on my outer V and into the
beginning of my crease I'm gonna get a
little messy here for a second but we're
gonna blend it out just like that and
then I'm going to go back into that e-40
brush and blend in circular motions
again
can never do enough blending with this
palette and you know I think the sad
part about it is that it's such a
stunning gorgeous palette and you really
can get a pretty eye look with it but
it's just like oh it's so difficult to
you you know everybody had like raves
about these palettes and I feel like if
you're just like an everyday sort of
person like me and you're not a makeup
artist it's just they're hard to use
they're hard to use all I'm gonna say
blending blending and then I'm gonna go
back into the palette and I'm gonna take
that kind of white color right here and
with that blush with that blush with
that brush barrel the brush and I'm
gonna go right underneath a my no just
put a little bit of light there and I'm
also going to tap back in there and put
it on the inner corner of my eye just
get a little bit of lightness because we
are working with kind of smoky gray sort
of colors like that and the next thing
I'm going to do is go ahead and take
this little dual sided urban decay this
came in my reloaded palette this little
dual sided brush and I take that shade
best shade and that brush that little
side right there can I talk that little
sign right there is kinda like a shader
brush and I'm going to go into that
light pink shade I'm going to tuck this
all over my lid focusing on the inner
parts of my eye lid just to get a little
kind of light pink color and especially
really pretty I liked it I like this
color
like that
and I'm going to go back in and I'm
going to take the Sigma e35 brush we
haven't touched this yet I'm trying to
hold this Jesus how hard can it be and
I'm just going to go back and forth in
the crease again because like I said
this palette requires a lot of blending
i'm already eight minutes into it and
you know it's like one of those things
it's like i love makeup don't get me
wrong but i'm not a makeup artist i
don't want to have to spend ten minutes
doing an eye look what about you guys
what is the average amount of time that
you would like to spend doing an eye
look for me five to seven minutes great
all right that is good enough for me
okay now I am going to go in with this
little more food pencil brush this is
the morphe m-43 one little tiny pencil
brush and I'm going to go even to you
that purpley color that we put in our
crease and I'm just gonna go right in
there and we're gonna take this on your
lower lash line
I'm just putting it straight on there
and it looks really messy at first and
then what we're going to do is go into
that color that we used as our
transition I'm going to tap into that
and then we're going to blend matter
date
just gotta get it a little smokey look
at that you know it looks like it's like
a little scary right now but don't worry
it will look good once we put our
mascara so next we're going to curl of
those eyelashes I like to pull mine
I'm kind of pumped though I was gonna
say pump the one but pump the UM curling
thing
even every and then I'm gonna go in with
my Maybelline lash discovery at mascara
and I'm going to put this one layer this
on my lower and upper lashes and a lot
of you guys are excited for that video
on the eyelash serums that I use I'm
really excited to I haven't plans I do
plan up my videos a month in advance so
it's not going to be up until March but
don't worry it's gonna be a good one I
have been playing around with eyelash
like enhancing products for years and
years and years since I was a senior in
high school and I have definitely found
some good ones all right then I'm gonna
go in with one coat of the miss manga
rock mascara from L'Oreal I love this
wand this is just gonna give lots of
volume to lashes you could just leave
one coat on do whatever you want but I
like this one and I really like the wand
and I like this cuz it really really
does volumize the lashes it's a very wet
formula so be careful I always get
mascara all over my lids anyway because
my lashes are long and they go up to my
eyebrow when I blink I guess that's the
only downfall from using um like lash
enhancing products having long lashes
can be difficult when you're using
mascara but yeah this is a little bit of
a clumpy mascara so if you don't like
that sort of look you may not like it
I'm gonna put a little more on my other
eye as well you may not like that so you
can use whatever mascara you please
whichever one please do and then I'm
gonna let that sit for a couple of
seconds just to kind of dry a little bit
and
I just gonna let it eat and sit and then
I like to go under with like a q-tip to
pick up any sort of excess product let's
make sure that all of that area is
blended out nice they might go back in
with my 8:40 just make sure we don't
have too many harsh lines it's difficult
with this product again because it's
like this eyeshadow palette it's all
about harsh lines but I want to make
sure it looks as subtle as possible and
not too like in your face all right and
then we're going to go in it with just a
little duo indicate it and I'm just
gonna run that underneath to pick up any
sort of mascara that might have gone
under it looks like that it's about it
so this is the look I really really like
it I think it's pretty it's very nice
it's kind of smoky and it is eye-opening
even though we're using dark products
but for the most part guys this is just
a difficult palette to work with and
this is not the kind of thing that I
want to have to do for 12 minutes and 34
seconds I mean and that's with me
talking but that means without me
talking it takes about 10 minutes and
for me personally that's a lot of time
just to do your eye makeup I normally
like a palette that I can use in five to
seven minutes so overall I think it is a
nice look I hope you guys enjoy it and
yeah thanks for joining me
