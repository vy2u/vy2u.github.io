posting later in the day if you could
tell from my stringy ass hair I'm here
to do a little more of like a I guess
this would be considered like a vlog on
my channel since I don't really always
do videos like this web I literally am
sitting next to my perfumes on the floor
and I have you guys popped up on to
sephora boxes and i'm filming on my
computer but i wanted to come on your
and just you kind of like a more chatty
video with you guys i recently got asked
or requested somebody requested that I
do a video on how to have a successful
YouTube channel and I thought that this
would be interesting this is definitely
going to be more of a chatty video so if
you don't like those type of videos you
probably won't like this I tried taking
off all my makeup and I still have like
eyeliner everywhere and I just kind of
look like a hot mess oh please excuse
that but other than that I thought it
would be fun to just come on here and
kind of talk about this um a little more
in depth and also getting to like a few
other things but yeah I thought I'd come
on and do a few like suggestions on how
to kind of start your channel and also
how to grow your channel so yeah let's
just get right into it okay hot mess
anyway the first thing I want to
recommend for you guys is to go ahead
and post as frequently as possible now
this is easier said than done especially
for me since I do not edit my videos I
understand that most people edit their
videos I understand that that's just
kind of like a thing that everybody does
on YouTube whether you have a beauty
channel or a gaming channel or whatever
a lot of people edit their videos so i
know that you know i mean i sometimes
get criticized if i post like two or
four times a day if people are like
that's too much but honestly just post
as frequently as possible because the
more you post the more people are going
to notice your channel or the more
they're going to really kind of rely on
you not rely on you but you know what i
mean they're going to enjoy your channel
because you kind of become a frequent
channel that they watch because they get
to see you not only just like once a
week which is one of those things where
a lot of big youtubers I usually only
post like maybe once a week especially
like in the beauty community post maybe
once a week or once every other two
weeks and that's just because you know
they do this for a living and they're
making enough money that they don't have
to post super super free
what Leah um but I guess my advice would
just be to post as often as possible and
the second thing I want to talk about is
posting relevant content this is such a
big thing I think it's really really
smart to go ahead and see what kind of
videos are popular currently on youtube
so if we think about that right now as
of like what are we march 20-something
march 29 2016 what's really really
relevant right now that I see a lot of
give each annals doing our story time
videos and just reviewing new products
doing tutorials with new products the
way that I kind of like incorporated
this into my channel with that I kind of
started just buying everything that was
new and I'm not recommending that you go
and buy something that's new review it
and then like return it I really don't
recommend that because that's just kind
of comes off in like a sort of shady way
if that makes sense what I recommend is
that if you are genuinely interested in
a product like a something releases and
you're not that interested then don't
get it but if you are pretty much
interested in it then go ahead pick it
up and try and review it as soon as
possible now I will say you should
always have about two to three days with
a product don't just like take it out of
the box and then review it the day of
that's just that's just not what you
want to do I know that a lot of people
do do that do you I know a lot of people
do that however and I've been accused of
doing that as well now I do want to say
a lot of the videos that I personally do
the reason I get them so quickly and I
review them so quickly because I
literally pay for express shipping like
next day shipping and that is why I'm
able to review the products right away
and it's just kind of become this thing
that I really really enjoy on my channel
so i highly recommend just posting
relevant content the next thing i want
to talk about is um the other thing oh
yes like equipment and things like that
when you first start YouTube go ahead
and fill mom whatever you can I used to
film on this laptop up until about six
months ago and also you don't need to
get super super caught up in lighting
and editing and all that kind of stuff I
feel like in the beauty community we see
a lot of the same things like in the
past for 25 years still the most popular
videos are halls and tutorials and first
impression videos and don't get me wrong
I love though
I make those videos but I also think
that you know people get really really
caught up and start to I don't want to
say copy each other because technically
we all copied each other you know what I
mean like somebody started the first
impressions like crazed and I
technically copy them every time i do
first impressions but I guess what I'm
trying to say is just because like
people do voiceovers with a bunch of
like cool music played and stuff like
that during like a get ready with me or
something like that but nothing against
those whatsoever I really like watching
those videos and that makes me wish that
I could edit my videos because I think
those are really fun to watch but don't
feel like you need to use the same exact
music or you need to do the same sort of
style of video where you're just not
talking or this or that and I understand
that like there's only certain music
that you can use I mean I kind of
understand again I don't edit my video
so I'm not quite sure about like how all
of that works but I feel like a lot of
the time I'll go to get ready with me
and then literally I'll go to another
one is the same music the same sort of
style just trying to be different try
and be a little more unique i will say
sometimes posting a video i don't want
to say controversial video i did a video
yesterday called products on returning
and i put a disclaimer in there at the
beginning and said you know i personally
tried these products out they didn't
work for me you know i feel like videos
like that where you're really really
being truthful and you're just kind of
saying and how it is really get a lot of
attention people really like those like
if you don't have them kind of money to
go ahead and purchase all the new
products that hit the market go ahead
and try and think of some really really
unique ideas because that is one thing
in the beauty community I feel like we
are lacking it's just new videos new
content I feel like I've been watching
halls for the past four years first
impressions videos for the past four
years and again I create those as well I
literally just did two first impressions
videos yesterday and the day before so
I'm not bashing those by any means I
really like those but if you can be a
little different um with your channel
then go ahead and do that I feel like
something that people do enjoy with my
channel not everybody does but something
that people do enjoy with my channel is
the fact that I don't edit my videos if
I mess up I do it on camera and I just
kind of shake it off it is what it is
and it's one of those kind of things
where I'm not saying you should do that
too I understand that that's not
actually really normal on YouTube sorry
if I'm doing tons of our movement but I
understand that that's not really like
the norm on YouTube you really do edit
your videos and put music in and do cute
little things at the beginning and at
the ends but I just want to say i have
almost seven thousand subscribers and i
personally have never edited a video
ever I my channel so I don't want you
guys to think you need to have a ring
light and you need to have the best
camera and you need to have you know
amazing editing skills to have like a
nice subscriber count and also just view
count on videos when you post relevant
videos like story time videos and also
i'll never get that crazed by the way
i'm so not into story time videos i just
don't like it but anyway um story time
videos are also just like reviews and
you really try and review them right
away again try and spend some time with
the product so that you don't look like
a dumbass when you go on camera and you
literally like don't know what to say
about the product you want to have used
it but still like you can get your video
up like first or second I mean it's
really really nice and I have noticed
that when i post really relevant reviews
on new products i get a lot of new
subscribers because they are discovering
your channel so anyway I'm the next
thing you want to talk about is so
cheesy but just be yourself um it's just
one of those things that everybody says
but honestly I feel like we all start to
kind of replicate each other and that's
not just in the beauty community but it
kind of is like especially in the beauty
community I feel like I'm always
watching the same thing over and over
and I personally made the decision not
to edit my videos because first of all I
don't want to you and second of all I
just don't have the time to do it and I
think what's better is to post as
frequently as possible my subscribers
you guys have told me you prefer that
over maybe one video a week or you know
i'm sure i could post more than that but
still this is still hobby for me and you
kind of have to think about that in your
head like are do you want to like go
hard at this do you want to have you to
be your career or do you want this to
just be a hobby and uh yeah so anyway I
think I never went over what I wanted to
say posting relevant reviews don't get
too hot up and having the
lighting and the best you know beauty
room or this or that shirt you know it's
nice to have a cute little background I
used to get criticized a lot when I
filmed in the kitchen but at the same
time I was still getting high views on
certain kind of videos and new
subscribers that were coming in and what
else do I want to say Oh be intimate and
that's also weird be social and you know
intimate with your subscribers like I
see it's become this thing also on
YouTube where you just don't respond to
comments or you respond to maybe one or
two and then just leave everybody else
out when there comes a time where I will
not be able to respond to you guys
anymore I will let you know and I'm not
going to respond to any of you because I
don't think it's fair to just like
choose one that you want to answer or
this or that so I would say when you
have a smaller channel put that time in
and that effort in now I understand I
don't edit my video so I have that extra
hour hour and I have to do so and answer
comments at night time but that made my
channel grow so much when people realize
that I will actually answer the comments
you know in the comments section I
actually respond back if you have a
question even if you just say over hair
looks pretty I will always right back
with little hearts and smiley faces and
that's genuine and I mean it so I think
that that's a big thing as well and I
think that's about it those are kind of
my little tips posting relevant up
relevant videos like if you want to do
story time videos or reviews on new
products also coming up with different
ideas and ideas that nobody has really
come up with that's always really cool
and also let your subscribers like you
know ask for ideas I swear to you half
of my videos like my subscribers come
out with people are always like oh this
is such a great video idea and I'm like
no like literally you know I always try
and say in the video as well it's been
requested or something like that give
credit as well to your subscribers um
but yeah I have such a long list right
now if videos I want to get through
because my subscribers have requested
them or I have asked what you guys want
to see so definitely do that and
sometimes stepping outside of your
comfort zone is good as well I used to
not post tutorials on my channel because
I was a little nervous and I'm just not
great at doing makeup on camera or just
you know whatever I feel like I'm not
great with makeup and a lot
you are so sweet and face such sweet
things but once in a while now I like to
step outside my comfort zone and do a
tutorial or two so yeah just try and be
yourself post relative content and don't
get too caught up in what other people
are doing with their channels just
because they have amazing editing skills
doesn't mean that you can't have as many
subscribers as them just being a genuine
person and being real it's what people
you know will hit that red subscribe
button for so anyway I hope you guys
enjoy this little chatty video with me i
hope i answered um any sort of questions
that i may have gotten like i said
somebody did specify like they really
wanted me to do this exact video and
i've also just gotten questions over
time with people saying like how have
you grown your channel so i hope that i
have kind of answered some questions and
yeah let me know if you like these
little chatty videos and I can start you
know doing these once in a while on
certain topics that you would like to
hear about and yeah thank you so much
for joining me guys but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
