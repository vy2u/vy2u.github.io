thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a fantastic day this
video is going to be a review and i'm
going to do swatches for you guys as
well on this new ciate london palette
that i found on the sephora.com website
this is the olivia palermo collaboration
and I'm obsessed with Olivia Palermo
she's like my fashion guru idol icon
everything so I was really excited to
see that they did a collaboration with
her they also did some let's see here
they had like a bronzing and blush duo I
did pick one of those up loving it so
far and they had one other palette
called I think these Suede's this one is
called the smoldering palette by the way
but the suedes one had a little more
like neutral kind of um like earthy
undertones to it a little more greens a
little more Browns whereas this one has
a little more smokey colors to it but
still really really fall like both of
them look like perfect fell palettes um
and they also released a few nail
polishes with her so I'm really really
excited that they collaborated with her
I love the way they put everything
together the packaging everything is so
beautiful and I could tell that he
definitely had a safe and how things
were put together because it's totally
her style so really really am loving
that but anyway this was thirty nine
dollars on the sephora.com website this
is what the outer packaging looks like
and then they have the names of these
shadows on the back they don't have them
on the actual in in the actual palette
next to the shadows which kind of sucks
um but the actual Pam size inside of
this palette is really really big so
it's a little deceiving this is the
actual size of the palette it's
basically like the size of my hand and
you would think like oh the pan size is
probably going to be pretty small but
actually when you open it up you can see
that you get a lot of shadows in here
and they are pretty darn big so what I
really like is that you get these nice
kind of burgundy tones here and then you
get some pops of color over here like
those blue colors and the silver again
it is kind of annoying that they didn't
put the names on the actual palette
because if I'm gonna do like it I look
or something with this and I'm trying to
describe it on camera for you guys i
don't i don't know if i'll keep the box
i probably won't know the names of the
shadows i'll just have to point to you
guys which one I'm using but at the same
time you get this big big big um
sighs so maybe that is better that they
didn't put the names on there so I'm
going to let you guys know right away i
really really love this palette my only
complaint with it so far i have two
complaints the first one is that like i
said they don't have the names on the
actual palette and the second one is
that these are so buttery and smooth
that they can be over blended way too
easily i am one of those people that is
used to if i'm going to put together
kind of a smoky eye look like I did
today I am going to put a color into my
crease and then start blending away like
it a separate brush and start blending
that away a lot today I had I mistaken
again i forgot that i was basically
using this palette and just from muscle
memory i just grabbed a clean crease
brush and started blending and blending
and blending these are so soft and
creamy that they can actually be
completely blended away in like two
minutes so um I kind of had that issue
again today I had put let's see here
this color and this color on my lid and
then I went down here and put those two
kind of ready colors into my priests and
it just got blended away way too quickly
i kind of forgot that i was using this
palette this formulation it's just so
buttery and smooth and they just
literally can be blended away in a
couple of swipes so all you need to do
is literally put the color into your
crease you don't need to take another
clean brush and start blending that away
it's going to be really really nice and
blended in just how it is so what I
basically did was put those two kind of
pops of color the silver and the blue
just right on my lid with my finger I
kind of packed it on and then I went in
with the blue and took a little smudger
brush and went underneath my lower lash
line and then I took these two colors
into my crease and like i said i did
over blend but i would recommend just
going in with your crease putting it in
and leaving it because it will be
blended it will look nice um the problem
with over blending is that you keep
going and going and then things start to
get a little muddy looking which I felt
like kind of happened today with this I
look because I forgot that this
formulation is so soft and buttery so
that is the one thing i want to say but
that can also be a really great thing
because some people want to put looks
together really really quickly i think
this is a beautiful like fall inspired
sort of palette and you literally can
create a look under five minutes with it
so that it's awesome and you can create
a look with it using literally one brush
I mean you could use just Pat um you
know a color onto your lid with your
finger and then go into the crease with
a brush or even just like two brushes so
really really fast and easy that can be
a good thing it can also be bad thing
over blending just doesn't look good it
makes the look you know whole I look
look a little muddy in my opinion but at
the same time if you remember what god
you're using I should have remembered um
my muscle memory just was like oh ya
gotta blend and then I looked in the
mirror and I was like whoa way to over
blended I don't even know where those
beautiful burgundy colors went so that
can be a good thing and a bad thing but
overall really really impressed with
this palette like I said gorgeous
gorgeous colors I think that this is
just like if this palette doesn't say
fall to you i don't know like what fall
is literally it is so beautiful and you
get this nice matte color right here
that you can go all over your lid with
all the way up to your brow bro all the
way up to your brow bone and it's
gorgeous has a little bit of like a
creamy yellow undertone which kind of
cancels out any blue and its just oh I
just love the colors I just absolutely
love the colors like I said the
packaging is beautiful and it says the
ciate for Olivia Palermo there and it's
just gorgeous got kind of kind of
textured kind of yeah like what is that
like an alligator print or something
kind of textured on top and then the
gold all around really really awesome if
you want to use this um you know to
travel with that with the awesome and
then it has all the vehicles little
signature on the back and then it says
highly blendable colors definitely it
says kind of a covetable mirror and rich
and densely pigmented with a weightless
finish and they really are weightless um
now i will say like pigmentation wise
these are not like a um I don't know
what do I want to say like a lack lorac
shadow where you literally put it in I'm
sorry the Sun just came out and went
behind the clouds again but it's not
like a lorac shadowy you put your finger
in and it's like so densely pigmented
it's almost like too much this is just
the right amount it's like that
weightless texture that they talked
about but still extremely extremely
pigmented so anyway I want to go ahead
and starts watching these for you guys I
rolled up my sleeves
already as you can see on the back they
didn't really put the shadow names
together in a format that kind of
matches the palette so I'm going to give
my best guess at which one each is I
guess you could say because some of them
look kind of similar on the back here
they don't in the palette but on the
back here so i'm going to give you guys
my best guess i do want to say there is
a mix of matt in here shimmer and then
there is one kind of glittery shade in
here they feel absolutely identical um
which is awesome i love when a palette
can come out with a really really creamy
matte color and then you go in and you
use you know the shimmery colors and the
glittery colors and it still is that
same kind of texture and format I think
that's amazing so all of these feel
identical so anyway let's just get
started watching i am going to swap this
one in the middle first this is a matte
color and that is what it looks like and
I have it right there so that color is
called Butler really really beautiful
the next one I'm going to take I'm going
to do this little square area here so
I'm going to take that Matt kind of
cooler gray color and that color is
called I'm guessing this one is double
denim and this is a matte like I said
let's see here right there double denim
and then I'm going to go into that
burgundy right below it this one is a
shimmery shade like a satin shade i
would say really beautiful I'm trying
not to over blend these because like I
said they just like oh my god you
literally can / blend them away too
quickly um so that is a beautiful
beautiful burgundy shade and that one is
called I'm thinking that one is mulberry
so really really gorgeous kind of dark
reddish burgundy then next one i am
going to swatch is this beautiful silver
color up here i have that on my lid
today this one is also kind of that
satin color gorgeous and this one is
called to do pisces so there's pisces
look at those colors those are so full
like like that just says fall to me okay
like I love that that is beautiful
alright the next one I am going to
swatch is this one down here and this is
the one that kind of has like those
glittery particles in it really really
beautiful i would say it's like a dark
gray with tons and tons of silver
glitter in it but again it doesn't feel
like glittery and chunky but it's
gorgeous gorgeous girl pretty pretty and
that one is called to do penny jar all
right now i'm going to go over here and
this is kind of a dirty a dirty dark
green color i would say it's got a
little bit of brown a little bit of
green and this is a satin finish
beautiful right there those two would be
gorgeous together to is an eye look and
that one is called let's see here God
they really don't do a good job of
describing which one is which on the
back here I gotta say this one is Tam oh
that makes sense and then I'm going to
swatch this Matt kind of burgundy plum
color down
here I have that in my crease today like
I said it is Matt beautiful look at
those colors together pretty 5050 and
that one is called amaretto mm-hmm love
that and then I'm going to swatch the
last two shades which is this beautiful
blue color up here it's like a blue kind
of gem color I do have that a little bit
on my lid today and this one is again
kind of like a satiny texture satiny
finish I don't even know how to describe
these finishes they're so different but
wonderful some awesome formula and this
shade is called London is it yeah London
beautiful and then the last shade in
here is this beautiful color it's really
really great for transition it's just
like a light um grayish Brown sort of
color and it is a matte and this one is
called blondie so there's blondie so
those are all the shades in here
absolutely gorgeous I think that they
are highly pigmented very easy to blend
and very weightless they don't feel like
there's a ton of like texture on your
hand or your eye or when you swatch it
like on your finger everything has the
same sort of finish if that's even
possible I know that they don't you know
I know that this is matt and i know that
these are kind of shimmery shades I
don't even know if I can describe them
as a satin this one has chunks the
glitter but they just feel the same it's
really really awesome what they've done
here with this formula so really really
beautiful palette again I think this one
has a little more pops of color than the
suede one does the suede one like they
said has a little more like woodsy
colors a little more Browns a little
more neutrals a little more greens
whereas this one has that kind of pretty
um like section over here that has a few
pops of color like I think of silvers
and blues like being new your new year's
sort of colors so I really really like
that and then these are like everyday
neutral fall colors it's just so
beautiful it's so beautiful to look at
too I mean just a gorgeous gorgeous
palette you have everything you need in
here this can go as the brow bone
can be your transition and then you work
any of these shades wherever you want
them so awesome awesome palette for
thirty-nine dollars I think it's such a
steal especially for a high-end palette
I think that that is beautifully priced
um just remember not to over blend them
they just are one of those amazing
qualities and formulations where you
don't need to over blend it's kind of
like that one and done sort of look you
literally could use one brush and use
your finger to tap on you know the
product onto your eyelid and it's like
it's just such an easy palette so I
highly highly recommend checking this
out I also checking out the bronzer and
blush duo I did pick one of those up I
like it a lot I got the kind of darker
shade i think it's called seaside or
something like that it's got a darker
kind of coral shade and then the matte
bronzer they're both mad absolutely
gorgeous they also have a dusty rose one
and then they have another palette just
like this one I may have to get it
honestly because this is a beautiful
little palette um so anyway I hope you
guys enjoyed this review and swatches
I'm sorry if the lighting went a little
in and out we're having a very weird
cold cold it's like 46 degrees here
today I know it's crazy but we are
having very very dark clouds and then
the Sun will pop out and then dark
clouds again so i apologize if the
lighting went a little crazy there for a
minute but um thank you so much for
