today I am reviewing at the new ciate
blush pop cream blush it comes in a cute
little box like that and the actual
packaging looks like this if you guys
saw my review yesterday on the cream
highlighter you'll have known that I'm
not liking the packaging at all it comes
in this tiny level like mushroom dome
shaped applicator that you're just
supposed to put directly onto your
cheeks I don't actually think it works
like that like I described in the video
yesterday I just think that the whole
application is wrong because the minute
that you start rubbing this onto your
cheeks that's gonna move around other
products that you already have on your
face so anyway I won't go too into depth
about that if you want to know you know
my big issues with the packaging go and
check out the highlighter video because
I definitely definitely talked more in
depth about how I definitely don't like
the packaging however um it is the same
packaging as the bronzer the blush and
highlighter they're all the same I will
be reviewing the bronzer one after this
so you guys can go see directly all the
different videos the highlight the blush
and the bronzer but anyway this one is
the blush review this is the color I got
it is the color schmooze they have six
different shades and they go for $19 on
the support website they have a hot pink
color they have a dark pink color they
have a fuchsia pink
they have a deep rose color a rose pink
and a coral color so shmoo is the one I
have is a fuchsia pink and I would say
it's um in between a cool-toned and a
medium tone pink I do have it swatch
right here on the back of my hand and as
you can see gorgeous I mean the color is
just really gorgeous super super glossy
really really creamy easy to blend out I
really really like it um I do like to
apply this blush with either of my
fingers or a ELF stippling small stipple
brush or any kind of stipple brush but
the elf's must've looked awesome
when it comes to cream blushes so I
really like applying it with that but
overall I love um the way it looks on my
skin I think it's just a gorgeous color
I don't have a ton of blushes with this
kind of color it's really in between
that cool tone and medium tone pink
which I really love so um like I said
this is the color schmooze I'm gonna
read a little bit on the Sephora website
for
guys so you guys can hear a little more
about the formula and things like that
it says what it is a mini pot applicator
with a highly blendable cream blush
totally agree with that really really
easily blendable however you guys know I
don't like the applicator like I said it
just moves around product the minute
that you start rubbing it on your cheek
um it says what it does sweep this blush
directly onto the apples of your cheeks
and blend in the cream formula with your
fingertips for a rosier complexion
infused with spherical powders it
creates a flush that's packed with a pop
of color for natural looking glow it is
formulated without parabens sulfates are
fabulous and that's really all it says
on the website so it's basically just
your all over you know cream blush um I
really like this a lot more than I like
the highlighter again check out my video
before this if you guys wanted to see my
review on the highlight the highlighter
just had like bits and glyphs of little
like shimmer inside of it and not even
shimmer like glitter so it wasn't my
favorite it's a little more rough to
apply on to the skin like I would put my
stipple brush in and apply it and it
just it did leave a nice highlight in a
nice color however it just really really
wasn't easy to blend this formula
however is really really easy to blend
let me show you guys quickly so you guys
can see you can see that you can just
really like blend it in with your
fingertips if you're having like kind of
one of those no makeup days where you
just want to just put like a little bit
right onto the apples of your cheeks and
really blend it out and just have a
really nice like flush glow I think this
color is really good but also um just
like the you know blend ability of it
it's just it can shear out into almost
nothing so really really really happy
with this blush I definitely like it
more than the highlighter I will
reviewing I will be reviewing the
bronzer next so go and check out that
video to see um what I think about that
one but overall I'm really happy I
picked up this flash I would definitely
consider picking up a few more shades I
think that this shmooze color is just
awesome I love that pinky color I really
think it's beautiful but overall I'm
really really happy and yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed this review see you in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
