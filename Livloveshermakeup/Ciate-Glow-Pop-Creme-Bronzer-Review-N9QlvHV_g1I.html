ciate cream product that I'm going to be
talking about today these are new on the
sephora.com website and i picked up the
highlighter I picked up the blush I have
reviewed both of those those were in
past videos and I also picked up the
bronze or the bronzer is the one I'm
going to review in this video the only
reason I did not review them all three
together was because the formulas are a
little different i just wanted to talk
about them separately so the one I'm
talking about in this video is the ciate
glow pop cream bronzer so the bronzer
comes in one shade they have a universal
shade I'm the only one that they have so
far is called Honolulu and it's called a
beach bronze color I would say it's like
a demi Matt Sam yeah I would say like a
demi Matt kind of finish I haven't
swatched right here on the back of my
hand as you can see it kind of looks a
little probably looks a little funky but
it's really really easily blended out
onto the skin and I think the color is
really really nice if you have and by
the way that's not the product falling
up that's like a little buzzed a little
piece of fuzz that probably came off of
the baby white but anyway like I was
saying it's really really really easily
blended into the skin just like the
blush um if you guys watch the video you
know that I did not like the highlighter
as much as I like the blush I like this
bronzer just as much as the blush so I
really really like the bronzer I really
really like the blushes highlighter not
too much it was a little chunky the
formula was a little different than
these two but this one really has that
nice formulation that the blush hath and
it really just blends in beautifully you
can really share it out onto the skin
like you can really blend it into like
the apples of your cheeks or you know
wherever you want to almost contour i
want to say because this does not have
any shimmer in it it just gets kind of a
dewy look um so you could really really
if you want to blend it into the temples
you know the car you know hollow out
like hollow out contour out the hollows
of your cheeks underneath your chin you
could really contour with it honestly
and I think that's really awesome
because you know like i said was only
nineteen dollars and right now
contouring products and things like that
tend to be really pricey so i think it's
totally awesome that you could
technically use this as a cream contour
so just like um the highlight and the
blush they have a little bow
on the front which is cute I will say
again although if you've watched the
other videos you already know I'm going
to say this I don't like the packaging
the thought is that you can take this
little dome applicator and just put it
directly where you want to put it I
think it moves whatever you have ah how
do I explain it whatever you already
have on your face it's going to move the
product if you just start rubbing this
on top of your makeup so for me it
doesn't work if you're someone who
really doesn't wear a foundation or
powder then I think it could work but
that's my issue with all three the
highlighter at the cream blush and the
bronzer I just don't really like the
packaging and I think it's a little
deceiving because on the website all
they show is the front so you think it's
like a little pot when it's not you
really don't get as much product as you
think however like I said it is only
nineteen dollars for each $19 show the
highlight $19 for the blush in nineteen
dollars for the bronzer so that's
something to think about it's actually
really really well priced anyway I'm
going to read a little bit for you guys
on what it says on the support website
it says it is a silky cream bronzer for
a beautiful blend of full Sun kiss
finish and I totally agree with that I
think it gives such a beautiful
sunkissed kind of glow you know you're
not picking up a lot of orange in here
even though it may look like it at first
it really really isn't that orange and
it really just blends like a dream you
guys you can blend this in with your
fingers you can blend it in with a
stippling brush my favorite way to apply
any kind of cream product is with a elf
small stipple highly recommend that
brush so really just I like it you know
I definitely definitely gonna try
contouring that this I've only used it
so far as a bronzer to warm up like my
cheeks but definitely going to try it
out for contouring because I think it's
definitely capable of that um let's see
what else does it said it says for a
golden glow tan instant simply swipe the
glow pop cutes dome applicator onto the
skin to add a pop of summer color to
your look again I don't think you can
just take it and swipe it on without
messing up other things that are already
on your face but whatever they want to
think that it can be used that way
that's fine it says the 180-degree dome
applicator allows for perfect placement
every time that's another thing I kind
of disagree with because as you guys can
see it's already starting to wear away a
little bit more on this side than that
sign
it um and that means you're not getting
the perfect application every single
time if you are applying it this way
however if you pod with a brush you can
coat all the bristles and apply it
anyway let me keep reading um it says
the 180-degree don't applicator loss or
perfect placement every time and the
highly blendable cream texture makes it
simple to create a flawless texture
definitely agree with that spherical
powders provide a lightweight semi-matte
finish so it does have that um we'll all
three of them I think have a like I said
Debbie matte finish so it basically goes
from cream almost to a powder I'm not
going to say fully to a powder because
it by no means does that it really does
take quite glossy on the skin however
you know once you apply powder over it
you can't actually you know tell that it
was super glossy anyway um it says it is
formulated without parabens sulfates and
satellites and it says try pairing it
with the glow pop highlighter to create
a sculpted contoured look I might try
bad like I said I wasn't a huge fan Oh a
huge fan out of the highlighter but um
you guys can go check out the video if
you guys are interested in seeing
exactly why anyway um so I am happy with
this one I do like this bronzer I hope
they come out with more shades I do
think this is a nice one if you have
fair skin the color honolulu is really
great but um overall I'm pretty happy i
would say out of the three ciate
products that i tried the past two days
i would say definitely look at the
bronzer and blushes skip on the
highlighter so anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed this review I'll see you my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
