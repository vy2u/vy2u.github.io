you are all having a really good day
today I am doing a review on the new CEO
a glow pop cream highlighter I purchased
this for 19 dollars on the Sephora
website I will link below where you guys
can pick it up anyway so it came in this
cute little box and it says Glo pop
creme highlighter very cute it came in
this little tiny little square box I do
want to tell you guys right away I also
picked up a bee bronzer and a blush from
the new ciate like line however they all
are they all they all are marketed
separately so I am going to review them
separately for you guys because some of
the formulas are a little different and
I was originally gonna do the
highlighter and you know the bronzer
together and maybe the blush separately
but I'm gonna do them all separately
interviews just because I have found the
formulas are all quite different so
anyway um let's just get started this
review is on the creme highlighter like
I said $19 on the Sephora website
basically it is in the color starlight I
think that's what it's called right yes
starlight they only have one shade and
it is this shade right here as you can
see it's like a very um like almost
terracotta II kind of color it's got
definitely more reds and more like
bronzy colors in it then a sheen kind of
color or like a yellow or gold in it I'm
gonna swatch it here on my hand quickly
for you guys so you guys can see can you
guys see that like it definitely has
some color to it you know this is not
like something that you're gonna put on
it's gonna be like a light beam across
the skin however it does apply
differently because I am wearing it
today down my nose on my chin and on my
cheekbones and it really didn't leave
too much color it really just left kind
of like a nice glow now my issue with
this first of all is the packaging on
the website all they show is this like
the front of it with the cute little bow
and you think like oh that looks great
and then when you get the packaging here
Wow that's kind of weird it comes like
this so it's like this little like a
little mushroom or something I don't
know it's like this weird little
packaging and you hold it and right away
you understand what they're going for
they want you to go right on to your
face directly that doesn't work it
doesn't work I'm sorry if you wear a
foundation like I do or powder the
minute you're gonna rub this across your
face across anything that has powder set
to it it is just going to move your
foundation it's going to move the work
that you've already done on your face so
no I don't think that you want to be
like painting this on I understand that
that was their idea and that it's really
really cute however I just think that on
the website it's like completely I don't
know it just doesn't look like this it
looks like it's gonna be like a big nice
cream highlighter and of course it's
this tiny little like mushroom cream
highlighter so I mean it's one of those
things where it's like um you know I
wish they could have shown the whole
thing but whatever that's okay um so
anyway like I said it comes with that
cute little bow on the front and the
more you use it obviously the more the
bow disappears
unfortunately um so basically like I
said I can't just rub this onto my skin
no matter if I'm having a really light
foundation day if I'm wearing baby cream
if I'm barely wearing anything it still
moves my foundation so I think that
their idea they are just kind of failed
if you're somebody who has absolutely
flawless skin and you don't need to wear
foundation or concealer or anything and
all you're wearing is highlighter then
yeah that'd be beautiful you could just
paint it on to be like bam bam bam good
to go but for the average woman the
average woman is not just going to take
highlighter and wear that just that so I
don't really think the idea and the
concept works it's the same with the
blush and the same with the bronzer
unfortunately I will review those um for
you guys on my channel soon but it's the
same concept and I just don't think it
works in any of the forms whether it be
bronzer blush or highlight so anyway um
don't love the packaging don't love the
concept of how they want you to put it
on however I think the color is
beautiful as
it looks really beautiful on it glows
and it just picks up just enough glow
for the skin no matter what complexion
you are if you had really really deep
like ebony colored skin I think this
would be gorgeous because it would
really really show up that kind of
terracotta eat gorgeous like gold on my
skin tone it still looks really nice you
guys can see right there I am wearing it
today and it still looks like wow
beautiful very high lady however I just
think you would look even more beautiful
on people to have darker or deeper skin
tones um I'm gonna say right away it's
not as smooth as I would like it to be
it does have kind of chunks of glitter
in it um it's one of those things that
it's like yeah it it has little bits of
glitter in it it doesn't go on
completely smoothly it's not gonna be
one of those products where you're not
gonna see it on the skin if I go up
really really close you guys will be
able to see little flecks of glitter on
my skin now I only like to wear it this
kind of product when I'm having a great
skin day where you can't see my pores
and things like that because otherwise
it really just emphasizes you know fine
lines or fine lines around your eye or
even you know emphasizes your pores or
dry skin so just be careful with
glittery chunky glittery products like
that that can always emphasize things on
your face that you don't want to
emphasize so something to be aware of um
since I told you guys I don't actually
apply it like this like directly onto my
skin where I like to use this an elf
small stipple or any kind of stippling
brush Pat it in there kind of swirl it
around and then just work it right onto
my face that seems to be the easiest way
to apply it I guess you could rub your
finger in it and tap it on if you want
to but I find that a stippling brush is
the easiest way I'm gonna read you guys
a little bit about what it says on at
the Sephora website it says the C at a
blow pop creme highlighter $19 the color
is Starlight they only have that color
so far and it says what it is a creamy
highlighter that creates a blendable
illuminating finish it says what it does
glow pop glow pop helps anyone highlight
enhance and add a touch of radiance and
luminosity the 180-degree dome
applicator allows for perfect placement
every time
highly blendable cream texture makes it
simple to create a flawless look
spiracle powders provide a lightweight
shimmer finish to brighten and beautify
what it is formulated without satellites
sulfates and parabens and what else you
need to know try pairing it with the
glow pop bronzer to create a sculpted
contoured look like I said I will be
reviewing the bronzer and the blush soon
so keep your eyes peeled for that I want
to use them a little more probably
review them tomorrow for you guys but um
so yeah so I mean I think that for $19
it's like oh it doesn't feel like it's
like a huge waste however you just need
to know that on the website just because
they show the top if that doesn't mean
that it's like a nice little dome kind
of thing you know it's like a little
mushroom and the product is really only
that first like third of you know at the
top so don't know how long this will
last you also if you do have patchy skin
or some dry areas or problematic skin
you might not like the actual chunks of
glitter in here I know they said it's a
smooth finish but it really kind of
isn't I don't know if you can tell but
there's still little glitters left on my
hand even after I've wiped it off so
just be aware of that um however I do
think it's universal shade for all skin
tones because I have very fair skin and
you would think that this would give
kind of a bronzy glow but it really just
gives me nice glow right there on my
cheekbones down my nose and my chin and
so I think that it's okay that they only
have one shade because it really does
look nice on most skin tones or
hopefully all kingdoms so anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed this review like I said
keep your eyes peeled for the review on
the cream bronzer also at the cream
blush and I'll see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
