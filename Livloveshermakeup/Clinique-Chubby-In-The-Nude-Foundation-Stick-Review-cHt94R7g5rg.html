guys my review my thoughts my opinions
on the new Clinique chubby in the nude
foundation stick I purchased this for
$24 on the Sephora calm website and will
link below where you guys can pick it up
if you are interested it is not an
affiliate link but anyway I really
thought that this was going to be one of
those products that was really fantastic
easy to use on the go and boy was I
wrong but before we get into but I don't
like about this product coz there's a
lot I'm gonna go ahead and read on the
Sephora website kind of explaining what
this product is supposed to do for you
so it says the Clinique chubby in the
nude foundation stick it is $24 and if
they do have quite a nice variety of
shades I ended up getting the brush rum
shade for my skin tone personally
because when I purchased my product the
only one that they had on the website
that was super light was the shade is
0-2 which is the second to lightest
shade now they do have the voluptuous
vanilla on the shade which is a 1 and
that technically is the shade I should
have gotten but at the time they didn't
have it and I got abundant alabaster and
it's completely the wrong shade but they
do have a nice selection of shades we're
really really deep to medium skin tones
to some layer States not saying this is
the most fantastic range ever and like
that they're really catering to the
darker girls and the really really light
girls but for the most part they have a
nice selection this is supposed to be a
creamy stick foundation for blue-faced
application and touch-ups that achieve
instant perfection on the go this
flexible foundation offers portable
perfection from full face coverage to
bare minimum touch-ups creamy
moisturizing and oil-free this
foundation stick blends easily and built
for sheer to moderate coverage with a
long wearing natural finish the shades
are alabaster ivory creamy come walk
yeah golden neutral neutral vanilla
beige golden amber and clove so like I
said the color selection is somewhat ok
for me personally I did get the wrong
shade it is zero to abundant alabaster
and it's much too dark for me let me
show you guys right away what I mean and
it's just too bad because this one was
described as let me read exactly what it
says
abundant alabaster is a neutral pink
shade for very very fair skin tones with
neutral undertones
I'm sorry but
to see like that at all it's just too
dark it doesn't seem like it has neutral
undertones whatsoever if anything I'm
seeing a lot of pink almost warm
undertones actually yeah the longer
wears on my skin the more kind of peachy
warmer undertones I get but I think when
you first apply it there's a lot of pink
undertones so where do I even start with
this foundation this says this is a hot
mess this foundation is a hot mess okay
I'm sorry I don't mean to swear but I I
just could not believe how crappy this
product was and unfortunately I did not
keep my receipt I will be using it for
concealing properties or like concealing
purposes if I need to touch up something
or for the most part I will not be
putting this all over my face I am NOT
even wearing it today because it was
actually that disgusting when I wore it
so the first thing I want to talk about
is how much product you get in here you
only get a point to one ounces the
standard foundation is usually one fluid
ounce so you really don't get much in
here the reason I was excited about
purchasing this is because I did enjoy
the curvy contour and the hefty
highlighting stick that Clinique had
released and I also enjoyed their chubby
lipsticks like I like they're not like a
really really natural one they have the
intense chubby sticks they have some
nicer lip products from this chubby line
so I thought oh my gosh this is going to
be great it's gonna be really easy I
could just open it up I can go on the go
I can just put this all over my face so
I have tried this with numerous primers
numerous numerous sort of anything from
silicone to hydrating primers and I just
can't seem to get this foundation to
work for me it's not just the shade
that's off it's the fact that this
claims to be moisturizing and long
wearing this wears probably three to
four hours tops on my skin I have
combination skin so I'm very dry on my
cheeks and very oily in my t-zone and
this makes my t-zone extremely oily
within an hour and it makes it look like
literally I am aged by thirty years
underneath my eyes and on my cheeks so
it really over emphasizes my dry areas
and in my t-zone it makes me look like
just a hot oily mess so I'm not quite
understanding how we can even do that
I'm like how is this foundation so
horrible like how is it actually that
how could it actually overemphasize the
oil and then also like make me look like
I'm 30 years older
I have tried wearing it numerous
numerous times even with a silicone
primer which is something that's very
very silky and you would think would
just make any sort of foundation glide
on like butter this is just chunky and
cakey and gross this is one even layer
on my skin and my hands are slightly dry
right now but you can probably see it's
not just that it looks like a mask
because the colour is wrong there is
texture visible texture when I go like
this and I put it like right at like my
direct I view basically I am seeing
actual little pieces of texture and I
have tried blending this with a brush
I've tried blending it with my fingers
I've tried blending it with a Beauty
Blender god forbid beauty blenders are
earth sponges like the Real Techniques
sponge are the one thing that makes my
foundation no matter what it is look
pretty much flawless and this is just oh
it's just disgusting you know it's
really horrible foundation and I don't
need to sit here and be like I hate
Clinique and bla bla bla bla bla you
know yes I understand that this shade is
not for me it is the second to lightest
shade and it's a very very dark but it's
not just this shade it's also the
formulation it's just so cakey it's not
moisturizing it makes my oily areas even
more oily and the wear time is just so
insignificant I mean there's so the wear
time it's just it boggles me because it
will start to break up around my nose
area my t-zone where I get oily but then
it sinks in and just sits oddly on the
areas where I am dry it literally makes
me look I will look in the mirror and
I'll be like wow I didn't know I got
those wrinkles like literally like if I
didn't have wrinkles before I do now
that's how this foundation makes it look
on my skin so really really not
impressed with this foundation
whatsoever like I said I did not keep my
little receipt that came with the box
though I will try and play around with
this and use it maybe for concealing
purposes you just don't get a ton of
product in here and I was really excited
because they thought you know this would
be nice on the go that is how much
product you actually get so definitely
not a full fluid ounce or not you know
yeah
not one fluid ounce but anyway I think
the price is pretty darn good $24 is not
that bad and I won't
say I actually really enjoy a lot of
clinic skincare items so it was kind of
just it was disappointing that this one
definitely did not work out for me but I
just want to say I mean I find it very
strange that I am dry on my cheeks and
it seems like anybody who has dry skin
even though they claim that this is
moisturizing I'm telling you right now
it made me age like 30 years when I was
wearing it it just sunk in it sinks in
it doesn't sit on top of the skin it
doesn't blend seamlessly with the skin
it sinks into your pores and your fine
lines it's really gross so I don't think
people with dry skin would like this
people with oily skin stay far away it
will start to break up on your face and
just make it look blotchy and disgusting
I can't really think of a skin type that
would enjoy this maybe if you have very
very normal skin you might and it's just
it's a bummer because I really thought
this was going to be a really easy way
to throw my foundation on really quickly
on the days where I just don't have time
to you know do like the full Beauty
Blender and all that kind of stuff I
thought I could just you know basically
paint this on my face in the rub it in
with my fingers but unfortunately it's
just really is a very very shady product
so I hope you guys enjoyed this review
like I said if you are for whatever
reason interested in getting this
product even though I did give it a
great review you can go ahead and
purchase it below like I said it's not
an affiliate link but just make sure
maybe if you are interested maybe go in
store and swatch it first and see what
I'm trying to say about the texture and
also the colors
I feel like Clinique's foundations
always run about a shade darker so
definitely go ahead and get a shade
lighter if you are going to pick it up
but anyway yeah I'm really really
disappointed with this foundation stick
because it was so cheap or relatively
cheap for a foundation $24 for something
that is like sold at Sephora I'm not
super disappointed that I lost my
receipt I will use it for maybe covering
up hyperpigmentation on my cheeks
underneath foundation but for the most
part it was very very disappointing so I
hope that this review was helpful to you
guys thank you so much for watching and
I'll see you in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
