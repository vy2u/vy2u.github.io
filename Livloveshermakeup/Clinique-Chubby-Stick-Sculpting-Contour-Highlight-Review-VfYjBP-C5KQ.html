today's video is going to be review on
the new uh what are these called
Clinique sculpting contour and
highlighting chubby sticks so they come
in the chubby stick formula which you
guys may be familiar with with their
chubby stick like lip crayons and they
twist up like this this is the contour
they are a cream product obviously and
this is the highlight um
I purchased these each for $21 on the
Sephora comm website I have just been
into really trying new contouring
products lately and I thought I'd give
these a go I am wearing them today and I
have to say I am having mixed feelings I
really really like the contouring stick
and by the way this is the packaging
they come in just these cute little
boxes and just so you know the UM
contour stick is called the curvy
contour and the highlighting stick is
called the hefty highlight so I don't
know I guess they're going with
reference to being chubby I I guess that
that's the thing whatever um so this is
what they look like you get let's see
here um point 21 ounces in each product
yes and uh like I said I'm a little
mixed about them I personally don't like
the highlight this is the highlight and
as you guys can see it looks really
pretty in the packaging it's just this
gorgeous like um pink shimmery color and
it goes on like this and you know it
looks so luminous but the thing is is
that it's kind of literary it's kind of
chunky and honestly it just doesn't
glide onto the skin and blend as well as
I had hoped
um I think it does have a little more of
a white base than a pink base even
though it looks very very pink in the
packaging but I'm just not super
impressed with this um this would not be
my number one grab for a highlight
however the contour stick is amazing um
as you guys can tell I'm pretty fair and
this is a contour stick that really
really looks good on pale complexion so
it's super dark as you guys can see I
choose a really light handle
I just kind of tap it on my forehead
down my cheekbones and um I really
really like it so as you guys can see
super super creamy formulas they do
blend out really easily and nicely um
another complaint that I saw on the
Sephora website was that people were
saying that they almost kind of blend
away in the skin I think if you have
darker skin and you're using the contour
I could see that happening but because
I'm so fair it doesn't really blend away
the color it really just shows up all
the time so anyway I'm let me read to
you guys what it says on the support
website um so the Clinique chubby stick
sculpting contour one it says it is an
oil-free creamy contouring stick for the
face it says highlight the face with
this long-run creamy contouring strip
stick creating the illusion of depth to
let your best features stand out it is
ideal for achieving contour at the
hollow of the cheeks along the jawline
and other areas and the highlighting
stick it says an oil-free cream
highlighting sticks so I do like that
the oil free I have not had any
reactions from these by the way and I've
been using these for a couple of days so
no bad reactions so far
it says accentuate your best features
with this highlighting stick formulated
with oil uh but I'm sorry
formulated with light reflecting optics
to illuminate the face long wearing an
oil-free it's ideal for wearing over
bare skin or foundation and to spotlight
the top of cheekbones the bridge of the
nose and other areas which is what I did
today but you guys know like I said I'm
not really a fan it looks so beautiful
in the packaging and swatch it just
looks like it'd be like wow like that's
an amazing highlight but it's really not
that impressive so overall I would say
go for the contour stick I think it's
awesome it's really really dark in color
really really deep beautiful and I would
skip on the highlighting um the hefty
highlight I just think it's a little
chunky it's not that it's chalky it's
just it's easy to blend out to it's just
that you know it seems to kind of
emphasize the dry patches on my face
also I don't like that so anyway I'm at
that was my little review on the
Clinique sculpting highlight and contour
stick there
he sticks I hope you guys enjoyed this I
will see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
