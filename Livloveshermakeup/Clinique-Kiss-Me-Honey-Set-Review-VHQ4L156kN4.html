with another review today and this
beautiful Sunday um save me now what do
you make it ease with me and she's being
destructive in the back hey okay anyway
I'm coming at you with another review
and this one is going to be on me new
clinic kiss me honey set from Sephora
this goes for seventeen dollars on the
sephora.com website and inside you
basically get like deluxe size I don't
want these samples but like deluxe size
products of three really nice deep black
honey shades from Clinique now
Clinique's black honey shade is like
this legendary gorgeous deep berry color
that looks super super intimidating and
almost black but it comes off as a
really nice sheer berry gorgeous
gorgeous color it's one of I think
probably their most popular colors and
they basically have it in tons of
different you know formats they have it
in the chubby stick they have it in the
super bomb boy stur icing lip gloss and
just it's wonderful so when I saw that
this came out on the sephora website for
only $17 I thought I have to get it it's
a great way to try some of the different
formulations of their lip products from
Clinique and also you just get to have
that nice gorgeous everyday shade even
though it looks so intimidating so
anyway um inside you get the Clinique
black honey
almost lipstick which looks like this of
course it's in black honey it looks so
intimidating but I'll show you guys what
it looks like as you guys can see on its
just really beautiful it's like a really
nice light berry color but this is there
almost lipstick which is basically in my
opinion like a glossy sheer almost lip
butter it feels beautiful on the lips
it's super moisturizing I really really
love it this is my first time trying one
of their almost lipsticks and I'm really
impressed and obviously I love the shade
the second product you get in here is
the Clinique chubby stick moisturizing
lip color balm and this is in richer
raisin I guess they don't have a black
shade in this one in this particular
format the chubby sticks but this is
like the closest closest color very very
close to black honey so this is also
really beautiful like I said it is
moisturizing but it's still that really
nice sheer color and I love the chubby
stick format I think it's so easy to
just apply on your lips you know it's
like a get-up-and-go kind of product so
really really like that and the last
product you get is the Clinique
superball moisturizing gloss in black
honey I am loving this I have tried
their moisturizing glasses before but
this is so wonderful it's so
moisturizing it is not sticky at all
it's super super smooth on the lips and
obviously you get that gorgeous a black
honey shade again where yes it looks
intimidating in the too but it comes off
just a really really beautiful shiny
light berry color so anyway super super
impressed with this little kid I love it
I think it's a great price for only you
know seventeen dollars and I'm gonna
read for you guys a little bit about
what it says on the Sephora website it
says it is a set with a lip gloss and
lipstick and Clinique's
at Kyle cult club try that again cult
classic called classic black honey shade
plus a moisturizing moisturizing and lip
comforting lip balm in a rich hue add
Lux color to your Beauty wardrobe with
this clinic kiss me honey set creamy
almost lipstick creamy almost lipstick
and super ball moisturizing gloss coming
Clinique's coveted best-selling black
honey shade a universal hue that
flatters anyone and moisturizes the lips
and I do agree I think it just it is
really really versatile and it does
moisturize and then it says it also
features the chubby stick moisturizing
lip color balm in rum ritual raisin
sorry I'm just gonna say Brown raisin
richer raisin which brings intense
Beauty to makeup looks and provides
ultimate lip comfort and then it says
this set contains the chubby stick
moisturizing lip color the almost
lipstick in black honey and then the
superball moisturizing glass
so each are point four ounces yes and
the superball moisturizing gloss is
point 224 so I think it's a really good
deal I would say for seventeen dollars
you really
can't lose when it comes to this you get
to try three different formulations of
lip products from Clinique and you get
to try it in like their best-selling
shade like they said cult classic or
cult favorite so anyway that is my
review I hope you guys enjoyed this
really really liked the set I will link
below where you guys can pick it up I
think spring is that time of year where
they start releasing sets of like
best-selling things from certain brands
and I think it's so fun it's kind of
like the second round after all the
Christmas like you know kids come out so
really really like this little kid I
highly recommend picking it up and I'll
see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
