thank you so much for joining me
I'm if you are wondering yes my bun is
back here I was looking in the camera
and it looked like because I usually
wear a really tight bond it looked like
literally I had no hair but yes low bun
today back there somewhere did not got
my hair but anyway um today I'm doing a
review for you guys it is not a new
product from Clinique it is the skinny
stick it comes in packaging like this
really really cute typical Clinique
packaging that has basically the like
little leaves and I don't know all of
clinic packaging looks really similar to
this but anyway this is supposed to be a
very very skinny eyeliner it's a
retractable eyeliner a very very skinny
one that is supposed to really have the
lash line so really be good for tight
lining and going on your waterline and
is supposed to just make your lashes
appear thicker and longer and fuller I
do believe they have seven different
shades I have the Sephora website pulled
up right here yep it looks like they
have seven different shades ranging from
a white one all the way down to like a
deep black one the particular shade that
I got is called slim sable in 0/3 it's a
dark brown color the actual stick looks
like this and I will show you guys right
now the actual like precision of the
product it's a very very small as you
guys can see so it really really does
hug the upper you know the waterline and
the tight line I keep wanting to say
lash line but no the waterline and the
tight line I'm going to show you guys
I'm just gonna drop quickly on my hand
so you guys can see how precise it is
and I'm not gonna draw too much because
this is really really hard to get off I
find that this layer is very very wild
throughout the day but anyway these are
$16.50 a piece on the sephora.com
website I will link below where you guys
can pick one up if you are interested
like I said they do have quite a good
range of colors they have a black color
to like darker brown colors they have a
green color of blue a purple and also a
white one which can be really nice for
opening up add the eyes so anyway um I
really find that this is a grey pencil I
really really like the color I got it's
like a deep chocolatey Brown kind of
color
absolutely no shimmer in it and I think
that it really really makes my blue eyes
pop which I really really like I do find
that when I tight line and go up and
waterline with this that it really
really does make my lashes just look
very very long and quite thick because
you're really coating that base where
the lashes kind of start from and it
really just makes them look really
really nice like there's no gaps in
between it's just really really awesome
I love how precise it is I do love that
it's retractable so there's no
sharpening but just the small little
like you know it's just such a clean
like application because it's so skinny
you know like you really can go so
lightly or you really can oops I just
broke it I mean I broke off the little
chunk I was gonna try and show you guys
how you can go like even even thicker
let me draw a line right now oh I'm
gonna hate this later because it's gonna
be so hard to get off but that's like
what it looks like thicker this is what
it looks like really like lightly kind
of just running over the skin and I just
love the precision it has the actual
like it actually screws up this way you
would think that it screws up this way
but it doesn't it just goes like that
and I just think that it's so precise
and it's so small it's so exact you
really just can't go wrong with it and I
think like with the sheets that they
have you can totally find one that is
gonna look good with your eye color you
can get like a more colorful shade you
can get the brown the black and yeah so
anyway I'm really really happy with this
product I'm gonna read a little bit
about on this like what it says on the
Sephora website for you guys
it says the clinics give me 6 $16.50
like I said I have my nano 3 slim sable
and it is a dark brown color it says
what it is an ultra skinny pencil that
hugs the lash line for a thicker fuller
lash look that's really all you can say
about the product this is probably not
going to be a super long review just
because there's not much to say it does
exactly what they say it will do so yeah
what it does glide on Clinique skinny
stick for ultra fine yet rich color for
natural-looking definition that gets as
close to the lash line as possible no a
sharpener needed the long wear formula
delivers rich even color payoff that
doesn't
smudge with a bronze shade range that
lets you achieve traditional and I
captain shades it's easy to use
packaging ensures mistake proof
application what else you need to know
this product is ophthalmologist and
allergy tested and it was 100% fragrance
free so really really nice if you have
sensitive eyes I highly recommend I
really just love the definition it gives
me I'm really one of those people that
love is like um like a white pencil that
really kind of opens my eye but I've
been loving lately just pencils that are
similar to this that have their really
really skinny like precise applicator
that you can really get right onto the
lash line with and tight lining and
doing the waterline I think just gives
so much definition to the eye and it
really really makes your eye color pop
so really really happy about this
product I like it a lot and yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed this review if you did
please give it a thumbs up and I'll see
you in my next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
