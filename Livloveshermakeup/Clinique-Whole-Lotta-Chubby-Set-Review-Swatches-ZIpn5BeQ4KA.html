thank you so much for joining me I hope
you guys are having an awesome day I
wanted to come on here and do a little
gift set review for you guys and do some
swatches on this new little Clinique
whole out of chubby set I found this in
the gifts section on the Sephora calm
website for twenty-five dollars I found
it right next to the bite Beauty Best
Buy rewind kit and you can now go on the
Sephora website and look under gifts and
you can find like $10 in under 25 and
under 50 in under and this is one of
those 25 and under little kits and I
thought it would be nice to give you
guys a review and some swatches on
something that's not super expensive
like a lot of those palettes that I've
been showing for what like the past
couple of weeks two to three weeks I've
been showing really expensive palettes
that can range anywhere from fifty to
eighty dollars so I thought it would be
nice to kind of show you guys some
smaller kits that you can get from
high-end brands this time of year and
also things that are perfect for
stocking stuffers if you are looking for
a little stocking stuffer ideas these
are perfect so this is the whole lot of
chubby set and in here you get a chubby
stick baby tint which is a moisturizing
lip color balm that is a I would say
deluxe size you also get the Clinique
chubby stick moisturizing lip color balm
that is also a deluxe size you get the
Clinique chubby stick intense moisturize
moisturize mean lip color balm that is
also deluxe eyes and then the last elect
size is the clinic chubby stick shadow
tint for eyes and then you do get a
closed eyes of the Clinique chubby stick
cheek color balm I believe it's a full
size it really does look like a full
size so anyway the packaging is really
really cute too like I said really
really easy and small you could
definitely stuff this into a little I
mean you can use it as a stocking
stuffer if you want to but I'm gonna
start out with the chubby stick cheek
color balm I do believe this is a full
size it looks very very similar to the
full size of the highlighting and
contouring chubby sticks that I have
from Clinique so I mean I put them next
to each other and it seems like this one
might be a little smaller but not by
much so this is a beautiful color this
one is called 0-1 amped-up apple and it
is this gorgeous kind of neutral II I
don't even know it's kind of like a
dusty rose color and how I apply this I
am Reina today on the cheeks and it is
very very subtle how I applied this was
just I put it on the back of my hand and
then I put my stippling brush in it and
kind of
put it on the apples of my cheeks and I
was really really surprised that this
did not disturb the foundation that I
was wearing I've been wearing a very
full coverage foundation this week it is
the Revlon Colorstay whipped along with
a pretty heavy setting powder from
Revlon so I was really really surprised
that this did not disturb any up that
product so I really did like that let me
go ahead and show you guys a swatch of
this because it really is a gorgeous
color can you guys see that isn't that
beautiful so really really kind of nice
it's a little glossy I feel like all of
the chubby stick formulas that you get
from Clinique are kind of glossy but
they're not completely completely opaque
they really can be worked with and they
can kind of be manipulated and when you
share this out it is just gorgeous on
the cheeks so I really really do like
this I think it's a really nice color
and I just want to say right away these
Clinique like chubby stick formulas no
matter if there's a shadow tint or the
bones or the contouring stick the
highlighting stick the blush stick
whatever like I said they really can be
manipulated and I think they are really
really gorgeous and natural I think
that's like a big thing
I feel like Clinique as a brand tends to
be a little more on the natural side a
lot of their products aren't super super
pigmented and crazy like out their
colors everything's very subtle and
natural and I think a lot of people
could wear this shade of as well as the
other products that come in here so I
really really love that cheek chubby
stick and that again is in the shade 0-1
amped-up apple and the second thing that
you get in here is a shadow tint I
believe that's what they call it yes the
Clinique chubby stick shadow tint for
eyes so this can be used as a base and
also it as a back this can be used as a
base it can also be used as a just like
a wash all over the lid or all the way
up to the brow bone it can be used
underneath your brow bone if you have
deeper like medium to deeper skin tones
it could probably be used as a highlight
depending on your skin tone of course
but I have it today on my lid and I just
love it it really doesn't um like crease
too much it does crease a little bit
because it is kind of like that how
would you describe it's a really really
creamy sort of formula and it comes out
you know in this tubby stick sort of
formula and it's just very very like
soft and creamy so I do notice
that it does crease I still do use a an
eye primer when I have this on so I am
wearing an eye primer today but I have
this on my lid and I think it's
beautiful it's a gorgeous color I think
it's absolutely wearable for anybody and
again I think that you could double this
as a highlight as well or wear it
underneath your brow bone on your
cheekbones depending on what your skin
tone is you guys can see it is a little
darker for my skin tone I probably can't
get away with wearing that as a
highlight but overall a really really
gorgeous neutral color that I feel like
would look beautiful on anybody's eyes
and you could also use this as an
eyeliner if you want to not quite sure
how well it would go on the waterline
since it is that chubby stick formula
and it is kind of you know like a chubby
it's not like a nice little sleek point
to this kind of chubby but I'm overall
really really beautiful and this shade
is called
0-1 bountiful beige and I feel like a
beige color you just can't go wrong it's
so easy anybody can wear that on their
lid and so I really do like that so that
one is right there as you can see super
glossy and pretty
I do recommend like I said wearing an
eyeshadow primer with it I just didn't
find that if I wore it alone I would get
a lot of creasing and like wrinkling on
the lid alright um the next thing that
they have in here is the clinic chubby
stick intense moisturizing lip color
bomb in 0-3 mightiest of maraschino or
maraschino how do you say that those
little maraschino cherries you know you
know what I'm talking about right those
fake cherries this has the bigfooting
cocktails that is what this is named
after and this is the like chubby stick
formula or the moisturizing lip balm
that they have that has a lot of pigment
to it so this one is a really really
beautiful color it is definitely like a
true red I would say it's got kind of
like that blue undertone and it really
really is pretty so it is right there
and I just love the formula I love how
easy these are to apply they have no
scent to them which is nice because
every time I open this I expect to like
smell something really strong and minty
kind of like the tarte lipsurgence but
they're not like that I feel like
Clinique again is really good with
testing their products being
dermatologist friendly and not having
skin irritating ingredients so
absolutely no scent or anything with any
of these but I think this is a beautiful
color really great for the holidays and
you really can share it out you don't
have to build it up as much as I just
did and that's watch and I think it's
beautiful I know
you guys probably thought I'd be wearing
this on my lips today I am not actually
wearing it on my lips today I'm wearing
the one I'm going to show you guys next
but it's a beautiful beautiful color I'm
always more likely to go for darker
colors than lighters but I really do
like what I'm going to show you guys
next in here so the next thing is what I
am wearing on my lips and this is the
clinic chubby stick moisturizing lip
color balm so this is just their normal
lip color balm formula it's not the
intense one and it's also not the baby
tint one which is barely too like tinted
at all and this one is in 14 curvy candy
and this is a gorgeous light pink color
I have it on my lips right now I have
been wearing it for about an hour and a
half I did eat and it's still there and
you guys this formula is just so
beautiful and it just feels so
comfortable on the lips this is one of
those products you don't need a mirror
for you can just apply it and it
shouldn't be an issue at all and I just
love the color liked a little bit of
subtle pinky color that it gives to my
lips again I feel like it's oh excuse me
I feel like it is so wearable and so
easy and it would really look beautiful
on anybody's like lip tone so that is
probably one of my favorite things in
this kit besides the amped-up
Apple what is this called chubby stick
cheek color balm so those are probably
my two favorites in here and then the
last one is probably my least favorites
this is the Clinique chubby stick baby
tint so this guy reminds me of
Maybelline Baby Lips however I like the
may believe Baby Lips better I'm a big
fan of Maybelline Baby Lips
but I've already swatched this because
it is one of those colors it's right
there it's one of those colors that
takes like it needs to get warmed up a
little bit so I did swatch it before
this video because when you first put it
on it's like completely clear like you
cannot see anything it does start to
kind of build up on your lips as you're
wearing it but it is right there and
this is the baby tint and it's it looks
so pretty like the color looks so
gorgeous if this was one of the intense
color bombs I feel like it would be like
the most perfect color ever but it's
supposed to be one of those very
moisturizing barely there sort of tints
to the lips and I find this one to be
the Amoy more most more than that I am
just tongue-tied today the most
moisturizing out of all three of the
chubby stick or moisturizing lip color
balms they are kind of in the
family but they're not you get that
really intense one you get the normal
formula and then you get this one this
one is definitely the most moisturizing
but it is a barely there sort of color
so it is a very pretty peachy apricotty
sort of sheer shade but um I don't know
I don't feel like I'm gonna get a whole
ton of use out of this I'd rather grab
one of my Baby Lips but overall I think
that the kit was set up so that you
could try a lot of the different
formulas that they have so this is
probably my least favorite in the kit
but like I said for twenty-five dollars
I feel like you do get a good amount of
product here and yeah so those are kind
of my thoughts my review and my swatches
on this little holiday kit from Clinique
I do think it's worth it um if you know
someone or if you are someone who likes
a really really natural look if you
don't like stuff that's too like crazy
and out there you're probably really
going to like this kit because
everything is very subtle and neutral
and I think this would be great for a
stocking stuffing great to give to your
best friend
or even just a gift to yourself like I
did with these so um anyway I hope you
guys enjoyed this review and swatches of
the Clinique whole lot of chubby set if
you did please give this video a thumbs
up and I'll see you in my next video bye
