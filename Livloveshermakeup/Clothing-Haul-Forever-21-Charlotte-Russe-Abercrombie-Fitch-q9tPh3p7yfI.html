doing I hope you're doing well oh my
gosh i'm looking at my hands and there's
like these random little pink blotches
all over I just I just filmed a beauty
haul that like right before this so I'm
sorry if I have like lingering swatches
on my hand I tried my best to get them
off but some of them are staining so
anyway this video this is going to be a
clothing haul I recently did some
shopping i got a check from ebates which
i always shop through online ebates it's
real you can completely get cashback
like for everything it's amazing I don't
have I'm not affiliated with them in any
way and I don't have like a link for you
guys to click on and then I get like
money or points or something but I do
highly recommend just going on to the
ebates website and checking it out
because it is really amazing I recently
got a hundred fifty dollars in cash back
in cash back back and cash back back
cash back back to me so i got a check
for one hundred fifty dollars which was
awesome and amazing and um i went and
had a little shopping spree so I I
always do that like if I'm going to be
purchasing things and you know ordering
make up online and clothing anyway when
I get my cash backs check I always just
put it into a special little pile so
that I can have it for myself because i
already spent the money anyway if that
makes sense so I just thought you know I
always like to give it back to myself
and just have it for beauty products and
also for makeup and you know skincare or
whatever I want clothing so everything
that I got um I went on to three
different stores everything I got was
under a hundred fifty dollars i believe
everything total out to be 815 I tend to
like to go and shop in the sale section
of online stores just because I feel
like the more clothing I can get the
better I'd rather have like seven shirts
for the same price as three so I always
just go right to the sale section
everything that i'm going to show you
guys is in the sale section I'm and yeah
so let's just get started I ordered from
forever21 com I also order from
Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch
then I ordered from charlotte russe so
let's get started guys the first thing
is from forever 21 it is this long
sleeve shirt right here it is like this
beautiful kind of topi pink beige color
and it has this wonderful little zipper
right here I don't know if you guys can
see that this is probably how I'm going
to wear it is to unzip it and we're a
little tank top underneath but it's very
very here and I just think it's so so
pretty it's got that really nice like
silky texture to it and I just I
absolutely love it so I picked this up
and this is in a size small just for
reference if you are around nice a night
the next thing I picked up was also from
forever 21 I believe this is from the
contemporary line of forever 21 and this
is in si extra small the contemporary
line I believe runs a size like smaller
so if you are a medium you'd probably be
a small in the contemporary line but
this is what the shirt looks like it is
like really really cute it's got a bunch
of little like holes in it it's a short
sleeve shirt so you can just wear a
black cami underneath it um and I think
it's adorable in the back you guys can
see that it has a little open like it's
open in the back basically it's just
really cool so it's like a really holy
kind of shirt but it's got like the
openness I love anything that's like
lacy or open and things like that so
this definitely caught my eye is the
beautiful cream color the next thing I
want to show you guys I am wearing this
is actually from charlotte russe it is
like this little like crew neck it says
crew neck I was going to say tunic it's
not really a tunic but it looks like
this let me step back so you guys can
see it looks like this it is this nice
little sweater and it goes down like
this and has this beautiful black lacy
printable bottom and I just paired it
with a pair of black jeans but it's so
nice it's really really stretchy it's
got that great like rayon kind of fabric
and I just wanted to show it to you guys
right away so I don't forget that I'm
wearing it but I love this and it's just
it's so nice and I just wear it with a
black cami underneath I think that's
really cute the next thing again from
forever 21 this is
size small this is just a beautiful navy
blue sheer little top that I found again
just wear cami underneath it I love
anything lacy and kind of sheer like
this it has these two little like
tassels in the front they have these
little folds like rim things and I just
think it is absolutely beautiful so I
love that another thing from forever 21
again in a u.s. small size is this
little boxy um what is this this is like
a little like it's definitely box cut
you guys know what I mean when I say
that like it's a very square and kind of
boxy like it's supposed to look very
boxy on the body which I really love I
love that kind of style a lot of people
are not into it my boyfriend's like that
looks so weird you know if like foxy
around the shoulders I think it's so
cute but um it's just a little short
sleeve and it has this beautiful lace
pattern that's actually really well-made
it's nice and kind of stretchy but not
thin to the point where you think it's
going to like fall apart in the wash and
in the back it has that little closure
that has the little button at the top
and I just think it's a gorgeous
gorgeous little tan color so I've picked
that up and let's see here this is the
last thing from forever 21 this is like
a kimono type um it's basically like a
sweater like a really really big sweater
like this I know it looks weird but it's
really really cute on and it has this
nice little belt that wraps around so it
kind of um it really kind of emphasizes
your waist again it kind of has boxy
Swedes and it goes about three-quarter
length so goes down to about your elbow
but it's really really nice and it's
this really really thick like stretchy
formula so you can actually kind of
where this as your little coat like
during the winter knit winter but like
the fall you know what I mean you could
totally get away with wearing this if
you are in California you could probably
get away with using this as your actual
coat throughout the whole year however
here in the Midwest it is already 63
degrees it's crazy that's why I'm
wearing this today it is crazy crazy
crazy i love how stretchy this is so
comfy
it is crazy crazy crazy called he
already so if it's really cold here i
could probably only get away with
wearing that as my overcoat for maybe
another month but um definitely if you
live in a warmer climate you can
probably wear it on your loan alright so
moving on to some things from charlotte
russe i picked up this little cardigan
it's really really cute for reference
i'm an extra small at charlotte russe
this is like a baby pink little cardigan
and it has this beautiful little pattern
right here I really really liked that
pattern it's so pretty and that goes all
the way down and it goes past my thumb
and it's just really really cute it's
very very open and loosely fit it has
kind of a nice little pattern and the
sleeves are very like um kind of big and
bunching which I think it's really
really cute so that is the first thing I
got from charlotte russe the second
thing i got is another little cardigan
this one is lacey and it is in a cream
color and i think this is just beautiful
it's just like it's just so pretty so
this is what it looks like you can see
that it has this little like florally
kind of pattern on it the sleeves look
like this they're very very big and they
kind of almost reach a little past the
elbow i would say really really
beautiful really kind of baggy and
pretty they look gorgeous under a really
really tight little like tank top I mean
not under over a nice little like tight
tank top um and it's just I don't know I
just think it's so beautiful so let me
hold it up again so you guys can see
that is what it looks like it almost
looks like a drapery or something like
literally um the next thing I got from
charlotte russe is this little top here
it's one of those that has like this the
spaghetti strap kind of things at the
top and that it has the actual sleeve so
your shoulder is showing again it's that
lacy kind of texture which I love it has
the built-in kind of camisole underneath
that kind of tan built-in camisole you
guys can see which is really really nice
because then you don't have to worry
about you know any kind of I don't know
nip slip or something like that or you
know see seen through the shirt so I
really really like that I think it's
very elegant
I especially like these little kind of
shirts when I am wearing my hair up
because you can see the whole decollete
and your shoulders and I find that very
elegant and sexy the next thing I picked
up from abercrombie and fitch this was
only like ten dollars i normally don't
shop at abercrombie and fitch but
sometimes i will go in on their website
and look at their sales department and
sometimes they have some really cute
things for you know under twenty dollars
so all these were under twenty dollars
this is a u.s. small size and it looks
like this and it is this beautiful olive
green color and it is again is that kind
that has the spaghetti strap and then
the sleeve and I don't know if you guys
can tell but the sleeve has lace going
down it which is beautiful and it is a
bell bottom sleeve which is totally like
hippie-ish I don't know but I think it's
really really beautiful it fits really
nicely on the body it's kind of like a
high-low because it goes a little lower
in the back and a little higher in the
front but I really really like it I
think it's cute the next one I picked up
from abercrombie and fitch is also in a
size small and it is just a typical
really really cute little white shirt so
you get those really nice kind of
bell-bottoms sleeves that go to I would
say a 33 length three lengths quarter
three quarter length you know kind of
sleeves and it's really cute you can
wear it off the shoulder or you can wear
it all the way up and it's just like a
little peasant top it's really really
cute I like that a lot and the last
thing I got from abercrombie and fitch
which is shedding all over the place I'm
gonna have to wash this thing it is this
oversized cardigan this is an extra
small / small and it is completely black
it has a pocket on the breast line and
it's got lace at the bottom it's just a
very very chunky oversized knit sweater
I think it will be very very comfortable
and super excited to wear that sorry I
have like a thing in my throat I think
of meeting a little sick anyway I have
let's see here two more products from
charlotte russe actually so um we're
getting to the bottom though
I i also picked up this little top from
charlotte russe sorry some of them got
mixed up but it's very very cute it is
one of those that you know I I mean you
could wear it without a tank top
underneath but I'm gonna wear it with a
tank top just because it's so cold here
already but it's one of those really
really cute little crop tops and it does
cap sleeves and it just looks so cute I
just love the way it looks and it's got
the lace and gray and you guys can
probably tell i love the colors black
white and gray how boring am i and the
last thing i got is also from charlotte
russe this is also a extra small and it
is this like paisley print um open kind
of sweater sort of thing it's got these
awesome sleeves with all these like all
this stuff going on I love lace I love
string and all this kind of stuff I'm
sure you guys can tell from this hall
hall but it's really really cute you
just wear a black tank top underneath it
and it just looks really really
beautiful and kind of hangs there nicely
on the body so anyway that was my hull
like I said all of this I believe Ike I
remember correctly was definitely not
over 150 because I had extra money from
my ebates check to shop at Sephora um
however I did um I do think it was
around 115 dollars so for all of this
which i think is a good deal so anyway I
got like what like 12 or 13 14 different
shirts for you know basically under $150
I think that's pretty darn good so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
did please give it a thumbs up and I'll
see you in my next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
