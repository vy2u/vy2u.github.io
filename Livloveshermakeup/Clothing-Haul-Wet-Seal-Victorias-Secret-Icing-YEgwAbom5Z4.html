hope you guys are having a great day
today I'm doing a call again for you
guys today however this is going to be a
clothing haul and a little bit of
accessories I was in the mall with my
boyfriend and I hit up icing which is
basically like eclairs it's like a cheap
jewelry / accessory store I also went to
a wet seal which is one of my favorite
stores and also Victoria's Secret so i'm
going to show you guys what I got and
yeah let's get started so I'll start
with what I got from icing because I
really only got three things the first
thing i got was this wallet my wallet
was starting to overflow and it was just
like busting out of the scenes it's
really bad so i could touch this wallet
it was nice and you know cheap and
cheerful and they thought it was really
really cute and if you bought a wallet
you could get one of these keychains for
two dollars so i got this little
keychain this is like am just a sparkly
rock basically um so i thought that was
kind of cute and i kind of went with the
wallet well it's going to go to my
outfit today but anyway so i really like
this it's really nice and sturdy it just
has you know all the areas for your
cards and your cash and whatnot and I
just think it's really nice so really
happy I got though and then the last
thing I picked up at icing or too little
sets of hair clips I really just wanted
the pink ones I thought they were really
cute however they come in a set with a
floral one so you guys can see this
little light pink one and then the
floral one and I just thought these
would be really really cute in my hair
or anybody's hair I'm progressive
progressively going blonder and blonder
as you guys can probably tell so I
thought the pink was really cute i was a
little disappointed that I couldn't find
two in the bin that we're matching um
but I just ended up purchasing two with
little sets of them so that those were
really cute um next let's go into the
wet seal so our deal with having a feel
or a sale basically on their dresses so
if you bought one you got the other for
ten dollars so imma show you guys what I
got I got mostly sundresses but then I
got one party dress so the party dress
is actually at the top so let me show
you guys this one first so the first
dress I got was this like party dress
it's so cute it's super super sparkly if
you guys can see it
covered in sequins it goes down to about
mid thigh and it is a very very tight
but I like it because it has like the
built-in pads here so you don't have to
wear a bra um and I just think it's so
so cute like I said it's very very
form-fitting and the back looks like
that and I just think it's adorable and
I just love it um I think that was
around twenty six dollars and because
that was 26 then the second dress I got
was only ten dollars so the second one I
got with that was this cute little
sundress right here um it's got like
that nice like spandexy kind of texture
to it and um I was going to say formula
I'm not talking about makeup to set
texture that I really like and it
actually can be born as like a strapless
or you have the option of wearing it
with these cute little ties that go like
that so I really really like it I think
it's adorable um and yeah the back is
just completely flat like the front so
that one with ten dollars since I've got
the sequin one and then next I bought
this one for around I believe again
twenty-six twenty-five twenty-six
dollars um and it looks like this and I
thought it was so cute it's like this
lacy beautiful print whip like a pale
pink underneath and um with my skin tone
I think that pale pink color really
really comes out nicely and at the
bottom and has this cute little fringe
it goes down to about not mid thigh it's
a little shorter it's kind of like upper
thigh but it's really really cute and I
don't think it's too sexy because it's
got that cute little a sprint and it
does show some cleavage in between as
you guys can see it has those two little
areas right there but it does show some
cleavage in between if you have bigger
was it um which I don't have a huge but
I am in full C cup so it does kind of
push together a little bit there so
that's really cute and I just think it's
adorable the back has a zipper and then
the closure is a little feed at the top
and it have a little open section right
here so I think that that is just so
adorable this is totally my kind of
dress I just love things like that and
then the last thing I got to love
another dress and this one
ten dollars since that one was full
priced so this one is just actually my
boyfriend picked this one out he really
like this he likes the color white on me
so this is what it looks like and it's
just a really Lacey flowy kind of dress
very very cute and like I said this was
ten dollars the closure in the back is
like a tea string sort of thing and yeah
it's really really adorable so that is
what I got from a wet seal now i'm going
to show you guys what I got from
Victoria's Secret and i am going to
sorry he cousin the guys something on my
lip i am going to show you guys what I
got from victoria secret and I do want
to warn you ahead of time I'm going to
be showing you guys panties which some
people are going to be like too much TMI
but um victoria's secret right now is
having a deal on seven panties for $27
which is awesome that's basically less
than one like four dollars of panty so
it's a really great deal and I want it
to show you guys the kind of panties you
can get for the deal so that it kind of
gets you going and we want to go to
victoria secret get it because it's such
a great deal and um I just think the
panties are really cute the selection is
really cute you know sometimes they have
these deals and it's like oh it sounds
so great and then you get there and then
it's like the panties are not cute like
they're all just I don't know most of
victoria secret cooking are cute however
some of them are just really plain and
boring but I wanted to show you guys the
cute ones you can get with this so
definitely go to account for Victoria's
Secret like I said seven counties for
$27 but before I go into that I do want
to show you guys they were having on
with their beauty rush which is like at
the checkout you can see they have some
lip glosses they have like some small
stuff some cute cute stuff um that's
just beauty related basically um and
they were having buy one get one free so
I got four things so the first two
things I got for these Victoria's Secret
um like lip uh what is this flavored lip
not a scrub it is flavored lip I don't
know why I just live your lips from
these are both lip glosses absolutely no
idea why it says flavored scrub um but
these are like lip balm lip kind of
glossed things so the first
I got it in strawberry fizz and it
smells really good and it was beautiful
like pale pinky kind of color and it
does leave a little bit of a tint on
your list and the one I got for free
with that one was this one which is just
a darker color and this isn't pink sugar
and Sam Sherman here on YouTube always
raves about this so I wanted to pick it
up i think it's gorgeous I did dip my
finger in there already it does tint the
lips a little bit really love it and it
has a minty scent so this one is the
sweet snack the strawberry fizz and that
this one happened may keep it um and
then I also got to lip glosses I have
not watched these yet but they have
flavored glosses so this one is the
purple one isn't so jelly which I
thought was really really pretty and
then the one I got for free with that
was the other flavored glass in this
orange color called squeezed so I
thought those were really really pretty
and I'm excited to see if they give a
little bit of a tint on the lips also so
um yeah now we are going to move on for
the last part and like i said if you're
not comfortable with this you can
totally turn off the video now i have no
other things i'm going to show you after
this so um but i'm going to show you
guys the panties I got 47 427 I just
think that's such a great deal you guys
really need to go so I'm the first pair
I got we're really really cute and what
I love is that these are there ones that
are normally like ten dollars and fifty
cents apiece so I just love that they
were having this great sales so the
first one is I really like songs so most
of these are going to be songs but um
the first pair looks like this and I
think they're so cute they had a green
color and then this plum color and they
have like these tiny little beads on the
front that are really on there nicely
they're not even like heavy they're not
beads they're just like I'm not sewn
into their basically and it has just the
normal song in the background and I
background in the back and I just
thought those were so so cute so that's
the first pair I got the second pair i
got i got two of these so I love these
multicolored little thongs um and I just
think they're so so cute so they had
this color which was the purple and pink
and it's a pink right there and I
thought these were adorable and so I
also had to get it in the pink and
bright orange one too look how bright
those are those cute
I love them so I really really loved the
colors of those two so I got two of
those the next one I got was like a
light orange just another little thong
it's a pink all around it really really
cute bright orange really really
adorable um and then I got to this tiny
little piece string like a very very
slim back thumb like this and this is
like a beautiful aqua color and this one
is originally like fifteen dollars so i
was just impressed that you could still
get it really really pretty loves for
this great deal um next I did get a
regular pair these are like cheeky ones
this is a bright green color like super
fluorescent it says pink up or not pink
up here it has a little dog and I just
thought they were so cute they're lazy I
love anything with lace and they have
the cheeky bottom so they really really
make it look like you have a bit of a
rough even if you don't I personally
don't and then the last one I got was
this beautiful lacy again because I love
lace um just normal thong and I thought
that the colors were so gorgeous so it's
coral on the bottom and then magenta on
the top and this one is originally like
1052 so I thought that that was so cute
so anyway those were the seven panties I
got for 27 and that's basically like I
said I think less than four dollars a
piece so that's a really good deal for
victoria secret thongs especially when
they're like ten dollars and fifty cents
so they have a lot of thongs they had a
lot of just the regular like chiquis
that they had a regular basic underwear
if that's what you're looking for but i
highly recommend going and technique
that out so i hope you guys enjoyed this
clothing haul if you did please give
this video thumbs up and i'll see you in
my next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
