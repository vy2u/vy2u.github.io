have a call for you guys today I just
did some random online shopping at
different stores and I thought I'd just
put everything together once all the
packages came and just do it as one big
hollis that are doing separate ones so
um the first website I went on to was
coach and I picked up this little
holiday for peace um fragrance like
deluxe size whatever i'm really happy to
see that coach is doing like holiday
things too i think it's nice um that
higher end brands are also doing that
because honestly um sometimes that's one
of the best ways to try things out and
it's affordable to everybody so it's
it's nice i like that and it gets a good
vendor spirit so anyway um it came in
that packaging and i got four of these
little mini perfumes if you guys saw my
perfume collection video you know i
already have four of these like full
size but they are different sense except
for this one is one of the same this one
right here is the poppy blossom how cute
those are guys they're so cute oh my
goodness and then two of the coach poppy
really i don't know if i'm getting these
names right I can't read on the bottom
the writing is so small but i just
thought these were so cute and probably
gonna give one of these to my friend and
they keep one for myself and then the
last one I got was the coach poppy
wildflower I believe this is wild flower
and that's my favorite one so you get
that set and i believe it is like
twenty-five or thirty dollars so it's a
really really good deal and it's a nice
way to try them out you can travel with
this size but also you guys and that's
why i got them because you know i didn't
smell them i didn't know what they sound
like my stuff with this one we do have a
full size of this one but um I thought
that was just so cute and the bottles
are just to die for just that's a great
holiday gift if you give it to someone
who loves little miniature things huh so
anyway that's all I got on the coach
website the next books that I went to
was lorac and I had one thing in mind I
wanted to get the unzipped palette and I
could not find it on the website it was
sold out and I went on to Alta and he
was also sold out on there so I thought
well I should obviously just buy some
other palette because you know I came
all the way here I've clicked on to this
page yeah it was just an excuse to get
another
this is the lorac summer glow eyeshadow
palette I chose this one and I was
really surprised that I chose this one
when I looked back later edit it is
bright this is bright these are not the
normal shades that I reached for but I
was thinking you know color pops and I
kind of think this is sectioned into to
like this is the more natural side of
the palette and this is the more like
poppy side of course this is just like a
poppy side for any kind of palette but
for this one in particular that's kind
of be like more laid back side and this
one's more outgoing but anyway I thought
this would be fun and they do have some
gorgeous like shimmery bronze shades in
there as well so I'm excited to play
with this it was a little different than
what I was looking for but I'm happy to
have it I will do review swatches make
me bring those in to you know videos
along the way um you know before I
actually review them because I like to
you know I don't like to just get a
product and then do swatches the day of
and do like a quick review I want to use
them for you know a good amount of time
and then give you guys a review so that
will be coming up on everything that I
got actually so the next website I went
to was mally beauty and I picked out
this durable little thing oh my god I
love this this is the Maui map map
stutter starter starter Malley's
volumizing lip gloss set you get three
in here and i love this packaging it's
like pink snake skin print yeah yeah and
it opens up it has a little magnetic
closure which I love and then you get
three of the volumizing glasses in there
so the colors you get our see pink
just peachy and baby doll and I love the
packaging is like so big and thick and I
don't know if that's because they're
volumizing so they wanted them to be
bigger than their other products I don't
have any other like lip glosses from Le
so I'm not quite sure but I just thought
it was adorable I know this is probably
not great for storage because they're so
big but beautiful colors and adorable
packaging she wins my heart on that one
and it's really good like it's well
packaged nothing is
cheaper flimsy so I really like that the
next thing I got was the Mallee ever
color waterproof eye shadow wait ever
color waterproof cream eyeshadow in the
color plum kind of matches my undershirt
i swatched it earlier so it's this
beautiful purple shade with like a
little bit of a silver iridescent to it
and I just think it's absolutely
gorgeous and you know after i got it i
was looking at the lorac like palette
and thinking oh my god those two
Purple's together mmhmm yeah I like that
so I think this could definitely be used
as an eyeliner as well because it is a
cream shadow you could use it as an
eyeliner and it would stick well um I'm
excited to use that I don't have any
eyeliner or cream shadow in this color
and really into purple lately as you can
pop in town and that also came with a
little dual ended brush and they're nice
and dense they're not flimsy at all so
really really like that Mellie has some
good products and they're never like
cheap or you know packaging is how is
good and it's good just got good stuff
and the last place i went to you was ok
i don't want show that on the last
website i went to was coastal scents and
i went there with one thing in mind to
get one of the revealed palettes and it
was the second one because i thought
that it looked a lot like the naked 3 um
i do not own the naked 3 i only have the
naked one so far make it three my next
purchase that i'm thinking about the
reason is taking me like so long as
probably because I'm not absolutely in
love with my naked one so I kind of
wanted to see if I could find other
things that would create the same sort
of look so I did get the revealed too
but I also got the original one whatever
I couldn't help myself so um I got both
of them one of them is um the first one
I think kind of machs like the first and
second naked palettes but then again I'm
not sure yet i'm going to do probably a
side-by-side comparison with the naked
one with this one and just to see you
know if the shades feel similar if they
really look similar are they dupes or
are they just visual dupes if that makes
sense like you they just look the same
as with a doob I really like something
that is same in texture
that's really hard to do but um you know
yeah that's that's what I'm that's what
I like you know um and same in
pigmentation um so I'll see with these
ones I think it will be fun to play with
um no matter if it is a dupe for the
nakeds or not beautiful shades hopefully
they're pretty and nice I'm a little
disappointed they don't have a mirror
here but that's okay so that is the
first one and the revealed 2 palette
also has 20 I shadow colors no mirror
again this is what that one looks like
and I think that row right there looks a
lot like the naked 3 to me um so I'm
excited to play with this see what's
going to happen with it I have no idea
um you know I think that it offers a
large variety of those like pinky Rosie
tones and you get more like lighter ones
on the top and darker on the bottom so
I'm excited to play it this one I
already did kind of dip my fingers in
there and they filled really soft and
nice you buy so far so I'm pretty happy
about that because I think these pallets
go for like twenty dollars apiece so
that's definitely better than splurging
you know and find the almost sixty
dollar Urban Decay palette so um yeah
you know it's kind of funny I just
noticed like don't you think that the
packaging like the outer packaging this
one should be for the first one and then
this one should even the second one like
I feel like that's so like Rosie toned I
feel like that should be for the reveal
to whatever anyway so I'm excited to use
these I will definitely do swatches and
reviews and i'll probably be using them
in a few upcoming you know get ready
with me or tutorials things like that so
expect to see these around and once i do
feel like i have a full uh you know
opinion on them i will do a review and
i'll make sure for the revealed one to
bring in my naked one palette and see if
there's anything to learn so that was my
hall i hope you guys enjoyed this I like
to make the look like to pause it's fun
a lot of my halls are usually like the
same thing over and over which is like
bath and body works from 21 and then
like you know saguaro a lot so far oh
and I do have another box coming that
does have ulta stuff in it but you guys
office so good let me just say it like i
love these websites that sell all the
brands
it's amazing so anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed this and I would say definitely
none of the other stuff was like on sale
or holiday oriented but the coach little
for fragrance thing was this was like
twenty-five or thirty dollars so i
recommend checking that out for a friend
or yourself for the holidays or you know
your parent or something so um yeah i
hope you guys enjoyed this hall and i'll
see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
