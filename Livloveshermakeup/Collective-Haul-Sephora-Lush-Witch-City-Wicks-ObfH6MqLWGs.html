channel what is what is that okay
welcome back to my channel today I have
a collective haul to share with you guys
I recently placed an order on the
sephora.com website as well as the lush
calm website as well as a cruelty-free
vegan candle company website so I
thought I would share with you guys what
I got let's go ahead and start with some
of the makeup that I purchased from
Sephora I have already started to do
some swatches I am incredibly impressed
with this first product right here as
far as swatches are concerned so this is
the Anasazi of Beverly Hills blush trio
in a peachy love I really did not think
I was going to get one of these but this
particular trio right here really caught
my eye as you guys can see the packaging
is so luxurious and when it hits the
light in a certain way you can actually
see the Anasazi of Beverly Hills logo
which is amazing you open it up you have
a nice sized mirror and then here are
the three strips of color that you get
with peachy love so I think these are
absolutely stunning at the middle shade
is matte this one right here is satin
and this one it does actually have
little tiny fine micro glitters in it
it's not as smooth and pigmented as the
other two but those are the three shades
right there and I really feel like I'm
going to like these and probably want to
go ahead and pick up another trio so
very excited for that the next item I
purchased from Sephora with the chart
clean queen a vegan deodorant so this is
my second time repurchasing this I
really enjoy this vegan deodorant it is
hypoallergenic formulated without
aluminum all natural and it is just very
very good quality from Tarte cosmetics
they have a lot of good skincare
products they will say speaking of skin
here I did purchase another drunk
elephant at bestie cantaloupe jelly
cleanser I have been loving what this
has been doing for my skin while we've
been here in Arizona it's a very very
basic cleanser and very expensive for
only 5 fluid ounces of product but
completely worth it in my opinion I
really like how it removes all residual
skincare in the morning and I really
like that I can use it as a double
cleanse at night time as far as makeup
is concerned so I wanted to purchase
another one of those
I'm very very happy I got that and then
also I was getting a lot of tags on
Instagram of people saying I should go
ahead and purchase this this is a chart
cosmetic the lipstick which I really
don't have a ton of Tarte cosmetics lip
products the ones that I do have came in
like holiday kits and they were pretty
good not as bad as like you know their
eyeshadow palettes I would say the lip
kits are pretty good the blood cells are
pretty good but people were saying to
purchase this because it
on sale for ten of dollars this is
called the Amazonian butter lipstick
initiate Park BAP princess which is one
of their most like well-known sort of
shades now if you have it's watched
right here and I have to say I feel like
I'm really going to enjoy it this
formula it's super creamy and actually a
little bit on the shear side it feels
very lightweight on the skin as well
which I like it does come in super cheap
cardboard packaging which I'm not a huge
fan of unfortunately it started to melt
a little bit in the box so it was left
here in Arizona but that is what the
color looks like I feel like it's a
really beautiful peachy nude sort of
color and it's going to be a good nude
for my skin tone so I am quite excited
to try that out and then I also did a
purchase let's see here this Lo and I
from hourglass this is one of the
ambient lighting powders in the little
$22.00 version so this is not a
full-size of the smaller ones this
particular one right here is in diffused
light which does have a little more of
like an opalescent yellow undertone to
it I wanted to get a mini to toss in my
purse when I'm out and about so that I
can set my under eye so that is what it
B shade it looks like a very excited to
play with that I have gone through full
sizes of that before and finally from
Sephora I did get a little 100-point
perk this is the a dry bar detox the dry
shampoo and honestly and I have a very
love hate relationship with this
particular product I do feel like it
takes the oil out of your hair but
sometimes it can almost look like
there's buildup in your hair after you
use it but it really works but like at
the same time it looks even more dirty I
don't know how to describe it but I have
a love-hate relationship with it so I
went ahead and ordered another one all
right let's go ahead and talk about what
I got from lush cosmetics Lush Cosmetics
lush calm Thank You s cosmetics now
actually but these are all bubble bar
and like bath products so the first item
I got here is the blue skies and fluffy
white clouds of bubble bar this is what
it looks like and I love their bubble
bars you guys I'm not a huge fan of like
bath bombs because I don't feel like
they do much and I really enjoy bubbles
in my bath and I feel like those just
kind of fades out quickly but this one
is a really nice arrangement of
patchouli as well as frankincense and
normally I don't love patchouli but this
one's smells super super fresh to me so
I did it get this one and what I'd like
to do with these is cut them into five
different pieces and then crumble them
under use my path so that I can have
five uses out of one
I also did pick up this guide right here
which was new to me this one is called
bright side this is another bubble bar
and this one smells amazing like
I could not honestly want to eat this it
smells so good and that is what it looks
like super super pretty so in turn you
get a lot of citrus oil as well as
gardenia
yeah really smells good I don't smell
any gardenia but I definitely smell of
citrus in here so again I will just cut
that into five pieces so I can get five
different uses out of it and then of
course I had to get my all-time favorite
lush products of life which is the
comforter bubble bar this one's really
nice if you like sweet bowls and this
one it definitely has a beer what does
this have in here it says it has cassis
oils bergamot oil I don't know all I
smell in here is blackberries I've
smelled amazing so I picked that one up
as well it's just so good you guys if
you like really sweet back you would
love the comforter I know they all said
you have like a body wash now which I
want to check out in a sense so I go for
this if you want sweet I would go for
the citrus one if you want something
like uplifting and then I would go for
the fluffy white clouds and blue skies
one if you want something a little more
perfuming alright next we they pick up
the needles and times a shower jelly I
am not liking this so far you guys can
see I've actually made some progress on
here so I did try this out probably
about three or four times so far you
guys can see it literally is a jelly it
looks like it's frickin radioactive it's
so green but it really smells good I
love to send up like pine and needles
and things like that needles and say you
know what I mean I love the sense of
Finance all like to me but I have to say
these are incredibly messy in the shower
I do not know how people use these I
tried taking it in my hand and putting
it all over my body I also try taking my
loofah and dipping it in there I just
can't get this to work for me so I don't
think I will be repurchasing any sort of
shower jellies from lush this was my
first time trying to shower jelly really
did not like that experience but I think
next I'll just go ahead and try out
their regular shower like cream and then
I also did pick up ocean salt which is a
face and body scrub this used to be my
go to body scrub but honestly these are
so freakin expensive it's not worth it
for the body but I will say this is
great for the face so there is a little
bit of alcohol in here which is nice if
you do have more oily skin it's not
super super stripping but this is a
crazy crazy abrasive scrub
so do not use this if you have sensitive
skin and if you just have normal skin or
dry skin like I do I would go ahead and
use this once or twice a week do not use
it any more than that but I've been
using this for a couple of weeks now as
you guys can see it smells amazing
smelled like a margarita yeah it smells
like a margarita to me and it's just
been really really good scrub so I'm
very happy I picked that up and then
here is an item called beet bubble
Briona this was my first time ever kind
one of these this is called rose jam and
actually came like a little macaroon or
macaroon and it had two different pieces
I already used one of them in the bath
and honestly I am obsessed it doesn't
smell exactly like fresh-cut roses they
have weight a little more of a sweeter
scent to it but it is so pretty and you
guys this made the most luxurious
beautiful pink bath water ever and the
bubbles lasted forever it also was very
moisturizing on the body so I am
definitely looking into purchasing some
more of those and then finally from lush
cosmetics I also picked up my all-time
favorites so which let me show you guys
what it looks like it was so freaking
beautiful and this is called the
Rockstar soap and it smells amazing this
has always been my favorite soap from
them I really like that I can use it all
over my body so I can use it to
basically under my arms I can even use
it in my downstairs area which I know
sells cleaning down there but if you
want to clean around it you can use
these kind of soaps that really doesn't
irritate or anything like that it does
have fragrance to it it smells like
candy kind of similar to the comforter
bubble bar but this is just like the
best block of soap if you're super into
like really girly fragrances and like
candy kind of sweet scent you would
absolutely love Rockstar from lush so
those are all the items I purchased from
left now let's go ahead and talk about
which City wick so which city wicks is a
vegan cruelty free sample company my
friend Rochelle found them on Instagram
so I went ahead and placed an order for
three of their candles they are very
very expensive with the came in boxes
like this which I thought was so cool
they look anatomy on the front so this
first one right here is called line for
Julie and it says right here on the box
so these are handmade artisan candles
from Salem Massachusetts which is why
they're called which City wicks made
with eco-friendly a hundred percent of
soy wax
lead-free cotton wicks and a
high-quality fine fragrance oils these
are dye free they have no added
chemicals and the art of vegan which i
think is awesome I'm no longer
purchasing for Bath and Body Works
anymore because I don't consider them to
be cruelty free so I really wanted to go
ahead and find
really delicious candles this one right
here is called line patchouli you can
see is really on kind of Asian listen
you're like the covers that they have
here with the anatomy I feel like it's
very unisex my boyfriend definitely
doesn't mind the look of these over the
bath and Bodyworks candles but this one
is really nice again I feel like it's
very unisex this sort of scent I'm not
the biggest fan of patchouli usually but
I think that that does smell pretty good
I know there's patchouli in that bubble
bar as well so anyway pick two that one
up and then this one right here is
called honey
lemon I have already started to go ahead
and burn it but this is what the box
that looks like so it's just identical
to what the actual candle looks like and
this one smells pretty good I will say
it has a little bit of like a baby
powder scent to it which I'm not a huge
fan of and I will say these are not
exactly burning incredibly evenly but
it's okay when it comes to like let free
whisk and when it comes to being cruelty
free and vegan I'm okay with that and
then finally the last one I picked up is
my favorite and this one is called
rosewood of musk and look it's got a
heart on it actually really think this
was cool so this one right here has a
really nice kind of would be a real much
you it and I'm really diggin it this one
reminds me a lot of like marshmallow
fire site without the marshmallow from
Bath and Body Works so if you like those
more musky fence I think you would enjoy
this so I'm going to go ahead and
purchase some more of those like I said
they were very very expensive you guys
and shipping took forever but I feel
like it is worth it I also want to go
ahead and try out some of the Pacifica
ones because those are also cruelty free
and vegan and let me know down below too
of any other camera companies that you
know of that are cruelty free and vegan
that use lead-free wicks as well so yeah
anyway guys that is my little collective
haul I hope you enjoyed this video thank
you as always for watching and I guess I
will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
