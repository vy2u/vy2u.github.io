thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having a fantastic day hold
on one second
okay this is like the sixth video I film
today so I hope I'm not all over the
place and like very distracted anyway
this video is going to be a color
correcting collab with my friend Amy
here on YouTube if you don't know who
she is you should definitely subscribe I
normally don't say go subscribe did this
person or do this or do that because
first of all I don't want to tell you
guys to do anything and second of all I
feel like you have to like vibe with a
person to subscribe to them you know
maybe you don't want to just go over and
subscribe and then later realize you
want to unsubscribe look you want to
like them as the person and also you
want to be interested and it's a very
personal like thing like you want to be
interested in not only their content but
also their personality so I normally
don't say go and subscribe but Amy and I
make very similar videos and literally
her content is ten times better than me
so I know you guys are gonna love her so
please go subscribe I'm gonna leave her
channel below her Instagram and also her
video on her color correcting collab
yeah for calling this I think we're
calling a color correcting collab which
one is best for you or something like
that go check out her video tell her I
say hello and yeah let's just get right
into this video okay I don't even know
where to start
I have lined to have all of my color
correctors in a little row and I'm going
to talk about my favorites and I'm gonna
start with my all-time favorite and then
work my way down to my least favorite
Amy and I have both decided to go ahead
and return
I think I'm returning to products and
she's returning three so I just want to
put that out there a lot of people have
also been like saying you know oh my god
yo men color correctors now what are you
gonna do with all them well I think the
point was to try out pretty much one
from every single brand and see what we
like and what we don't like
absolutely return it before I have an
amazing return policy and I don't
believe in holding on to something that
you're not going to use or that you
don't like so we are going to be talking
about that as well at the end I will let
you guys know which ones I have decided
to go ahead and bring back to Sephora
and also I want to talk about a
drugstore option I
also has a drugstore option this is so
important especially when we're talking
about high-end products that you know
five of the naked skin correctors that's
like $130 not everybody wants to spend
that kind of money on literally like a
green concealer or like a green
correcting fluid do you know what I mean
it's just one of those things that's
like okay so we went ahead and also
found some drugstore options that we
like or maybe we don't like I personally
like mine this is the NYX color
correcting concealer it's like a little
sextet I don't even know how to it has
six little compartments I'm a musician
so anytime you're in a group with six
people it's called a sextet but I don't
know if that's what they call this
but anyway it's really really lovely and
very comparable to a lot of the high-end
color correctors that I'm going to be
talking about so I'll talk a lot a
little bit I'll talk a little bit about
that at the end of the video after I
tell you guys which high-end ones I will
be returning but yeah I want to tell you
guys about my favorites I'm going to be
listing them from a favorite to least
favorite and let's see here I have the
Naked skin color correctors I have all
five shades I have all four shades of
the Smashbox color correcting Stix all
four shades of the Becca what are they
called
backlight targeted color correctors I
have the chart palette the wipeout color
correcting palettes and then the Sela
correct and perfect palettes so a lot of
to talk about I also want to just touch
on certain things like which is the best
for you because just because I
personally like a product doesn't mean
that it will work for your skin tone or
your skin type so I want to touch a
little bit on that as well kind of
talking about if you have oily skin
you'd like this more this or that I
personally have combination skin so keep
that in mind while watching the video
but yeah let's get right into it so my
favorite out of the bunch that I have
tried are definitely these Urban Decay
color correcting fluids I love these I
think my favorite thing about these is
the fact that they are like pastel sort
of shades they are not super pigmented
they're not you know they're just not
crazy okay which I really really really
enjoy please excuse my nails they're
wonderful I feel like they have a very
nice pastel quality to them they don't
go on super super opaque and just said
that but seriously they don't go on
super opaque it's like they have like a
white base mixed into them which makes
them so easy to blend you can wear these
on top of your foundation
you can wear them underneath your
foundation they blend so easily even the
green one
so the shades that we have here are
lavender which I'd like to use on fine
lines and wrinkles I like to use the
green one but it is called yeah mint I
like to use this one to color correct
any redness I have on my face I've used
the peach one to color correct any sort
of hyperpigmentation and then I use the
pink one usually on my eyelids to
brighten and the yellow one underneath
my eyes to brighten so if you guys have
a specific question about if you find
like you want to get one of these and
you have a specific question about where
you put it or things like that let me
know down below because I have done so
many demos pretty much on all these
color correctors and in that video I
show you guys where I put them in things
like that and it's pretty much the same
every time so I'm not going to be going
over that in this video I just told you
guys where I put these on my face but if
you have questions as to why or which
one would be better at leave me a
comment down below and tell me what your
skin tone is like and also your skin
type and I'll let you know but anyway
like I said I usually use all of these
correctors the Becca ones everything
Smashbox all of them in the same area
like green contract redness the purple
one I like to lift fine lines and
wrinkles with the pink one I like it for
brightening this also can double this
particular one can double as an eye base
the yellow one is great underneath the
eyes to contract any blue tones and then
the peach on my discoloration so I just
love these so much of these are an
amazing formula they blend like a dream
they're not overly pigmented but they
have coverage to them which i think is
great because a lot of these correctors
that I've tried and I'll talk about them
in a little bit some of them having very
thin oily consistency to them and I have
combination skin I'm not gonna put
something like that in my t-zone or
anywhere near it you know it's gonna
break up throughout the day and what
happens if for some reason I mean
normally I like to set in my foundation
but what if one day I don't want to you
know I should be able to wear a color
corrector like these ones put on my
foundation and then not have to set it
with powder so that's what I love about
these urban decay naked skin ones they
are quite pricey like I said you're
going to be putting down at least 130
hundred fifty dollars for all five of
these so what I recommend is choosing
out the one that you think would be best
for you if you have rosacea if you have
rashes on your face and get the green
one if you have a lot of fine lines and
wrinkles and you just want a lifting
along your jaw line find lines things
like that get the lavender shade the
pink one is great for brightening for
fair skin tones I feel like if you have
a deep skin tone you might not like this
pink shade as much you might want to
stay away from it but it's beautiful at
brightening I do think like I said i
swatched it on one of my friends hands
and she has a darker skin than I do and
it looked a little ashy on her so if you
want to get the pink one I would
recommend only getting it if you do have
light to fair skin the peach one is
great for all different kinds of skin
tones you can use this if you have let's
see here deep like under-eye bags like
if you have blue discolorations
basically you can use this on deep skin
tones you can use it on pale skin tones
I love it over - pigmentation it's
wonderful and then the yellow one is
great for brightening this is the one I
like to use in the upside down V
underneath my eyes and even on my really
fair skin tone it works very very well
so I'm sure it would also work very well
on those with dark skin I did swatch it
on the back of my friends hand it did
not look Ashley whatsoever it was just
that pink one that did so I would say if
you have basically any kind of skin type
and tone you would probably like these
again pink one might be a little ashy on
you but I think that the green one would
be great at the peach one at the yellow
one they're just absolutely fantastic
you can pick and choose what you feel
like you really need if you don't have a
lot of redness in your skin and don't
pick up the green one you know if you
feel like you have a lot of
discoloration and acne scarring then
pick up the beach one the yellow one can
also be nice to counteract you know acne
scarring so if for some reason you only
have acne scarring but you don't want
too bright and underneath your eyes and
don't think the beach won't get the
yellow one because if you ever want to
use it elsewhere you can so I think if
you have combination skin you would love
these I think if you have oily skin you
would love them sensitive skin you would
love them they have no weird fragrance
or anything like that the formula never
makes my skin sting or anything like
that I do have combination splash
sensitive skin I would say I think
literally every single skin type could
use these they just have the best finish
they're creamy they're not too opaque
they have a beautiful pastel like
quality to them if you're a beginner
with color correctors these are going to
be right up your alley
I love the way that they set on to your
skin like they don't leave you to dry
and they don't leave you to IE and they
never break down during the day so any
kind of skin type could use these babies
and they are my all-time number one
favorite all right let's move on to my
second favorite so these are going to be
excellent if you are someone who has
aging skin if you have dry skin and also
I think if you have combination skin
these are the Smashbox color correcting
sticks there are four shades and I
believe there are $23 a piece which is
cheaper than the Urban Decay Naked skin
ones these are probably the easiest to
apply they come in pencil format which
is super easy to use if you're one of
those people that doesn't like a big
fuss in the morning you don't want to
dip your finger in something or put like
a doe foot applicator on your face these
guys are great because they're fast
they're easy they're wonderful they do
come up with little sharpener so you
don't have to worry about that but again
we have a green shade which will
counteract redness we have a light kind
of peachy shade and it's a little
different than some of the other peachy
shades it kind of has a bit of a nude
color to it so it technically could act
as a concealer on a lot of different
skin tones so if you're really really
dark you might not want to get that one
because it might just blend right in
with your skin or if you wanted you
could use it as a concealer we have in
the lavender shade and then we also have
a dark peach shade and this is wonderful
underneath the eye area I really like
the way that these set on the skin like
I said if you have dry skin you're gonna
love them and the reason for that also
if you have aging skin if the reason
you're gonna love them is because they
have vitamin E infused in them so they
have a very beautiful quality to them
they can blend out very very easily but
at the same time they set down they
don't just sit there and they're not
like thin and oily and they don't leave
a weird residue on your face these
completely set without over-drying your
you know under-eye area anywhere that I
put these I don't get dry even along my
cheek area when I use the peach shade to
cover up hyperpigmentation I have combi
skin so I get dry here especially during
the winter it doesn't emphasize that
area whatsoever so beautiful beautiful
finish I would definitely look into
these if you are someone who you know is
in the in a hurry in the morning or if
you know you don't want to
time on your makeup but you do want to
color correct again you can go and
purchase the right one for you the Urban
Decay Naked skin and these Smashbox ones
are all sold separately obviously they
don't come in palette form I will talk
about a few palettes in a moment because
those are nice because you can travel
with them you get more bang for your
buck but I really think those Smashbox
ones are fantastic I love the way they
sit on my combination skin really really
beautiful they are a little more opaque
than the naked skin color correctors and
the reason for that is they just don't
have that really kind of almost
concealer or sort of consistency to them
let me go ahead and swatch so you guys
can see so here is the green shade it's
not completely obvious but it's also not
like the urban decay one which is like a
very creamy it literally looks like
there's like a white mixer mixed in
there if that makes sense these are not
going to give you like the concealing
properties that the naked skin ones do
again none of these are concealers but
you know they make the skin ones really
do act as a concealer as well so yeah
they're not going to conceal so much as
they are correcting or going to correct
your skin but they really are fantastic
at correcting the skin they are a little
more opaque like I said I recommend
wearing those ones underneath foundation
don't try putting it on after your
foundation because it's just not gonna
blend very nicely but super super easy
to use they come with a sharpener
they're relatively cheap $23 if you only
want one color you know I use them the
same way I use the purple one on my fine
lines and wrinkles you can use it to
lift or brighten anything you can even
use it underneath your eyes peach one is
great for those blue tones you can even
use it on the hyperpigmentation you get
the point so they're all really really
fantastic if there is one I would say
you could probably skip on I think it's
this one you look less tired light this
is the one that kind of like doubles as
a concealer it's just not super super
peachy but I would say my favorite out
of the batch is definitely these look
less tired dark which is a very very
dark orange so love that oh and I want
to say if I could only pick one of the
Urban Decay Naked skin at fluids I would
pick it's so hard
can I pick two I would pick two I would
pick the yellow one first and if I
had the choice to pick a second one it
would be the lavender so just wanted to
put that out there but anyway like I
said with this matchbox sticks if I
could only pick one it would be that
dark orange shade is gorgeous you can
use it on hyperpigmentation you can use
it underneath your eyes really really
fantastic so yeah moving on let's talk
about the Becca backlight targeted
correctors they come in little pots like
this these are the first ones I reviewed
and I will be returning one of them I'm
do still love the formulation don't get
me wrong but they're not as easy to use
because they come in little pots they're
a little heavy they're a little clunky
but they are absolutely fantastic they
are probably more on the kind of I don't
want to say oily side because the Sela
one is oily these are humectant this is
what they look like they literally come
in a little pot like this so you either
did your Russian or your finger not as
sanitary not as easy to use as these
Smashbox or the Urban Decay ones but
they are great this one right here is
the purple shade and you guys can see
it's creamy it's not oily it is creamy
it's opaque and what I like about these
is the humectant this they just stay so
moist underneath the eyes anywhere that
you put them really I do find when I'm
using let's see here like this shade
right here is called papaya when I'm
using this I do have to set it
underneath my eyes because I use that
too contracted blue tones and it has to
be set it's so moisturizing not oily
moisturizing and then the peach shade
when I use this I do also have to go
ahead and set this one I use that for
the hyperpigmentation and then the green
one you have to be careful with this
pistachio shade is very very in my
opinion visible on top of foundation I
am able to use these becca ones
underneath foundation and a few of them
on top but for the most part like this
pistachio shade it's too pigmented it's
a little too opaque and i do like it
because it is a bit of a green like a
lighter green like it's kind of like a
pastel green sort of like the urban
decay one but not as much so if that
makes sense but i really really do enjoy
these I think they're great I think if
you have again ageing skin if you have
dry skin I don't
you're gonna like this if you leave skin
they're just gonna slip right off your
face um but if you have oily skin and
say you get like dry underneath your eye
and you also have dark circles you would
love that papaya shade because it's
going to moisturize under there and on
top of that it is so pigmented it is
going to cover those dark circles so
they are quite pigmented a few of them I
can get away with using on top of
foundation like I said like the purpley
shade is nice but for the most part
they're pretty darn pigmented and pretty
darn humectant but that's nice because a
little goes a long way with those guys
I've noticed that these Smashbox sticks
like I already had to sharpen these the
other day like I'm feeling like I used a
lot of it in one sitting and same thing
for the Naked skin corrector is like
I've dip in there twice and I feel like
I am going to get through those a lot
quicker than me back at one so even
though you do have to dig your finger in
there I feel like a little goes a long
way because they are so pigmented and
convected and I think they would be
great for a lot of different kind of
skin types in general like I said
combination skin try and get the one
that you think would work best for you
if you are putting something that you
want to color correct in your t-zone
then I would stay away from the better
ones but if it's something like
hyperpigmentation that's you know on the
sides of your face or things like that I
think you would maybe want to check out
the back once they are quite good and
yeah I don't have too much more to say
about those I am going to go ahead and
link all of the demos and all of the
reviews on every single one of these
products you guys can see them all
swatched out and also apply to the face
if you are interested I don't have demos
on all of them but I have demos on most
of them so you guys can see how they
apply to the skin and get a better
understanding of what I mean when I'm
talking about all this stuff but I think
that if you have dry skin aging skin and
sensitive skin you could use it too
because it will put moisture back in
there combination skin go swatch them
out in the store first and if you have
oily skin they're just going to be too
moisturizing for you alright moving on
to the next thing we're going to talk
about palettes yeah this is the white
box color correcting palette from Tarte
and this is what it looks like I love
this because hello you get everything in
here so you're getting more bang for
your buck you get all the shades that
you need and you even get a contour in
here I've
say the colors in here that are kind of
a mist if I have to choose them would be
the orange shade which is a number one
which is right there the green shade and
the yellow shade they're a little oily
they're not super super creamy and
pigmented however in the contouring
shade and these two peach shades right
here are very very pigmented and very
creamy so there you can see here is the
creamy one and here is the kind of oily
one I will use the oily one but I think
like it's okay because like if I travel
obviously I'm not gonna pack all of the
separates like naked skin correctors or
the Smashbox ones I want to reach for a
palette so I okay with the fact that
those three are a little greasy like if
I'm on a trip I can work with it you
know I can make it work but what I love
about them is definitely these three
shades right here you can use these as
concealers depending on your skin tone
the contouring shade is actually really
easy to work with which is surprising I
normally am NOT good with cream
contouring but this is just a lovely
lovely color correcting palette the only
thing they're missing in here is
probably I would say like a brightening
shade like the lavender shade I thought
that would have been great
they could have done a peach shade and
then a lavender shade I feel like I'm
blanking you guys a peach shade and then
a lavender shade that would have been
fantastic but I like what they did here
and I like that you basically can
highlight and contour your face with
cream products I like to wear these
underneath foundation I do find that
they peek through a little bit steps
four and five don't always depending on
what your skin tone is like you can you
know mix and match all these which is
great too because you can use them how
you want to you can mix four with the
orange cream shade or if you want a
darker color for like the green one you
can mix it with a little bit of the
yellow or the contouring I tried that
the other night I know that sounds weird
but I wanted this green shade to cover a
little more redness and I mixed it with
the contouring shade and it actually
made it like a darker green and a little
more opaque and I really liked that so I
think if you are looking for a palette
you want more bang for your buck you
don't want a bunch of loose correctors
lying around this one is really really
good it's very practical I think it's
worth the money it's quite compact it's
about cheap packaging so I think if you
have oily skin you can use these I think
if you have combination skin you can use
these I think if you have sensitive skin
can also use these I pretty sure like
sensitive skin honestly I haven't had
any interactions with any of the
products that I'm going to be talking
about but I think also if you have dry
skin and aging skin you could get use
out of this as well like I said those
three colors that are on the bottom are
very very creamy and they have a very
luxurious moisturizing effect to them so
I think if you have dry skin or aging
skin you would like those because
usually when your skin is aging you
start to lose some whiskers so anyway
those are really really fantastic and
like I said if for some reason you have
aging skin or dry skin and you want to
use these shades up here but you feel
like they're very oily they don't really
give any moisture there a little drying
you can just you know mix and match you
can mix it into this shade right here
and just get that really nice creamy
luxurious formula so really really love
this palette absolutely great I think a
lot of different skin tones and types
could use this all right now let's talk
about the last product and this is my
least favorite I will be returning it
this is the Stila correct and perfect
palette I originally was not going to
return this because I love the powder
shades in here I love these right here
these are beautiful I want Stila to
release those in full sizes but these
colors here the cream products are crap
I love the compacts packaging it's
smaller than the chart one let me show
you guys for comparison it's smaller
than the Tarte one it's thinner they
even put in this little flap right here
to cover your cream products which is
amazing every brand forgets to do that
but the actual like correcting products
in here the actual creams are just so
not pigmented they're oily are my
combination skin they immediately break
up and I think even if you have dry skin
or aging skin you're not going to like
them because they're not humectant
they're oily and they just break up on
the skin I felt like they settled into
fine lines oh it's just not a very good
palette in my opinion it's such a shame
too because those two setting powders
are amazing that lavender shade right
there beautiful creamy gorgeous you can
put it underneath your eyes to brighten
and I like that they did the powder
thing in here it's a different it's
special but I've been just not willing
to hold on to like a $45 palette like
this if I only like half the products
inside so I would say if you have oily
skin stay away
combination skin you're also not gonna
like this if you have dry skin agent you
know what I don't think any skin type or
tongue is going to like this honestly
these cream colors here are not very
pigmented so if you're a very very dark
skin they're probably not going to show
up on you
I think trying to think of trying to
think of a skin type or tone that would
get a lot of use out of this I don't
think you would get a lot of use out of
the cream products and I don't think
it's worth buying this if you're only
going to be using the powder product so
I don't really have much to say about
that it's just the cream products are
not a good consistency they break up
during the day they're not moisturizing
they're oily and they settle into fine
lines so yeah boom boom for that one so
let me tell you guys about two the ones
that I will be keeping now since I've
gone through all of them this is going
to be a long video I apologize I'm just
trying to put as much information out
there as possible if I miss something go
ahead and leave me a comment below and
I'll make sure to get back to you if you
have a specific question but anyway let
me show you guys the ones that I am
returning so out of all of these I have
decided to return to the first one is
obviously the Stila correct and perfect
I just don't think it's worth it because
I only like half the products I won't
get use out of the others I think it's
great that it's in a compact form
because you can travel with it but
you're just better off being the dark
one because with this one even though
there are a few products in here that
aren't amazing you can mix and match
them with the other ones all of the
cream products in the Stila one stuck so
I'm getting rid of that and then I have
decided to return one of the Becca
backlight targeted color correctors and
I am returning the shade peach I loved
this one for my hyperpigmentation until
I tried the Smashbox once and also the
Urban Decay Naked skin in peach they're
just more pigmented I like the way that
you know I told you guys the Becca ones
are very few mentions and honestly I
just I don't know even though I you know
jawline and cheek area get a little dry
I feel like they still sometimes didn't
completely set and I'm one of those
girls I like my face to be pretty darn
matte so I just didn't like that along
my jawline I really do prefer the urban
decay
in peach or the Smashbox one so those
are the two that I'm returning the rest
I'm keeping so that's one two three four
five six then I'm pretty much keeping
almost ten correctors and I know that's
a lot but I really do find and I believe
that I will get use out of these if for
some reason I don't you will be seeing
them in my declutter series again in
November but I'm really hoping I get a
lot of use out of them so far I have
I've been using color correctors every
day today I'm actually where you need
beca ones underneath my foundation if
you are curious and yeah I'm happy to
have the separate ones it doesn't bother
me I'm happy to keep three of those back
of ones that I really enjoy and I like
that I did end up enjoying one palette
because this is great for travel alright
now you're going to talk about a
drugstore option I've only tried one and
that is the NYX color correcting
concealer little six pan palette it's
great it's the 3c p04 I don't know if
they have many different shades this is
great so it's basically it kind of
reminds me of the Urban Decay color
correcting fluids I may not be
consistency or anything like that but
the fact that they're kind of like a
concealer built into a corrector they're
just very very opaque you guys see that
very opaque very very creamy and
blendable and i really like them so the
shapes that you get in here you get a
yellow which is great underneath the
eyes you get the purple one for
brightening you get a peach one for here
at this is what they look like you get a
peach one for hyperpigmentation whatever
you want and again this is in palette
form so you can mix and match these guys
depending on what you want but I really
like these a lot I feel like they are
moisturizing they're not oily they are
moisturizing they're pigmented and you
can wear them underneath your foundation
I find that I can wear the what is it
yellow shade and also the peach shade
this peach shade and also the nothing
green one the lavender the yellow and
the peach shade I can wear those on top
of my foundation but I can't wear and
they darker ones because they just pops
through it like they really are quite
pigmented I think you would like this a
lot if you have dry skin aging skin
sensitive skin oily skin oily skin you
might
to make sure that you really like a
double set your makeup and but I feel
like combination skin you would really
like it so I think the only kind of skin
type I would say stay away from this
palette for is probably I mean no sense
I've been talking too long if you know a
least thing you might want to stay away
this might be a little too heavy on your
actual skin because it is a concealer
built into a color corrector but they
are very very good very very good
there's that green shade here is the
other peach one and what I like about
these palettes is again you can mix and
match and then there's that contouring
shade contouring train is probably the
weakest one out of all of them but let
me show you what a few of them look like
if you want to mix them together so say
you have darker skin and you want to
cover under-eye circles you can take
this pinky shade and mix it with the
peach one and I'll show you what that
looks like on the back of my hand and
you can create your own sort of color so
there they are mixed together so you
could use it literally that's almost the
color of my skin like I could use it as
a concealer you can mix and match them
if you have darker skin you can bring in
that contouring shade as a concealer
really really great I don't remember
what I paid for this but it definitely
was significantly cheaper than any of
the other color correctors that I
mentioned so yeah really really nice
alternative maybe something you want to
try before you go in and purchase any of
the other ones from Sephora or Ulta but
I will say Sephora has a great return
policy I sometimes have issues with also
returning things but so for the most
part has an amazing return policy and as
long as you don't hold on to it for over
three months you know you don't even
have to bring in the receipt they will
just look you up and you can return the
product but anyway this one is really
really nice from the drugstore let me
know down below if you have other
drugstore directors you would like me to
check out and maybe do a review on and I
hope you guys enjoyed this video very
very long but I wanted to go in-depth on
all of them because even though I have
done reviews on them and I'm going to
link all of those below all the reviews
and demos even though I already have
looked at them like that I really wanted
to show you guys my favorites so the
number one favorite is the Urban Decay
Naked skin
second favorite Smashbox color
correcting Stix third favorite Becca
backlight targeted correctors fourth
favorite that tart palette and then the
least favorite is the Stila palette
I have to throw in the next one in the
bash I would say this would actually go
before the back of one so it would be
naked skin Smashbox this one then Becca
then the Tarte one so yeah I think that
I'm really really happy I tried all of
these out I always thought color
correcting was scary and that it
wouldn't work with like my skin tone but
it really does as long as you wear them
underneath foundation if you're a
beginner always wear them underneath
foundation I've dabbled a little bit on
putting them on certain areas after I
apply my foundation but for the most
part you can't really go wrong when you
wear them underneath so I've talked a
lot I hope you guys enjoyed this video
please go check out amy's tell her I say
hello the product that she has that I do
not have is the cover FX Stix
yeah and then I have the Smashbox ones
so I hope that you guys got information
on both sides and we have different kind
of favourites too we have different skin
types and yeah so I hope this is helpful
thank you so much for joining me and I
will see you guys in tomorrow's video
