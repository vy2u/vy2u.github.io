today's video is going to be a new
series on my channel or it's going to
start a new series on my channel this is
going to be called the color spotlight
series where I share with you guys my
favorite makeup products from a certain
color area or color range i should say
so today we are starting out with a
berry toned makeup so let's go ahead and
just jump right into it i have a lot of
berry toned makeup however I will say
these are my top picks in the berry
category so the first item I want to
talk about is a Revlon super lustrous
lipstick now I feel like I don't talk
about these very often on my channel but
I love love love the formulation on
these I have the shades watched right
here it is called Barry rich and it's a
really really nice creme formulation
this is definitely more of like a warm
toned berry color so if you do have a
little more warm undertones in your skin
this would be absolutely beautiful like
I said it's watched right there I love
those way this looks on the lips even
though I do have a strong cool undertone
I still think that looks really really
fantastic and the swatch right next to
it is actually one of the Maybelline
Color whispers this one definitely leans
a little more on the cool tone side a
little more purpley again I love the
formulation on the niggling color
whispers kind of like the Revlon lip
butters they're very moisturizing and
humectant kind of like a lipstick mixed
in with a lip um like a lip treatment so
that is what the shade looks like and
this one is called let's see here Barry
ready so here we have very rich and here
is very ready one's a little more cool
tone and one is a little more warm tone
so I really like both of those I think
they are absolutely stunning I do have
two different blushes here to talk about
the first one is from to face this is
part of their long lasting 16-hour blush
line this is the love flush blush in the
shade your love is king I love this it
is a beautiful beautiful berry toned
blush I feel like the actual formulation
on these are really really nice they
have a little bit of like a satiny sheen
to them and it's not anything that's
going to look super super obvious on
your skin it's just the slightest amount
of Sheen and it really gives a lot of
glow to your cheeks without being like
oh my god she has on a glowy blush so
there is the shade your love is king
again it would look beautiful paired
with those two lippies they're really
really love that and even if you do have
a fair complexion I feel like it still
looks
really really good on the cheeks another
blush that I really love that I'm
actually wearing today is from to face
this is the sweethearts perfect flush
blush in the shade something about berry
or there's something about Barry so this
is what it looks like if you do have a
darker complexion this would probably be
more of a blush topper as you guys can
see there are three different strips of
color here and this one down here really
really gives it that very very look on
the cheeks it's almost like you have
like that glow from within like you just
came out from being in the cold so I
love this i think this is a beautiful
beautiful blush again it does have a
little bit of sheen to it this one has a
little more sparkles in it then the love
flush blush but this is what it looks
like a little more sheer but still
really really pretty especially if you
have a fair complexion alright moving on
I do have a blush palette here from elf
cosmetics that I think is absolutely
fantastic that really does fit into that
berry toned category this is the elf
blush palette in the dark version so
this is what the packaging looks like
you do get a huge mirror and here are
your shades so specifically I kind of
feel like these fall into the berry
category now obviously this is a little
more of a true berry tone right here
this one's a little more ready and then
we get quite red over here but these are
really really beautiful i love the
pigmentation on these I mean hello
pigment I think they look beautiful on
the skin and it just depends on what
your actual skin color is if you are a
little more fair skinned this one would
be a beautiful perfect very kind of
flush on your cheeks and if you have a
darker complexion this one down here
would actually show up is quite a berry
shade on your actual skin tone so I love
these they're very very pigmented I mean
seriously you guys super super pigmented
i'll go ahead and swatch the other ones
just for the hell of it but this one's a
little more red toned as you guys can
see and then this one is more of like a
neutral color but these are all
beautiful i would say they all have a
very very matte finish to them but there
they are swatched wow that one went over
my knuckle but i think they're really
really beautiful they do offer a lighter
version of this palette as well that i
do enjoy but i don't know i love dark
berry tones especially on my cheeks even
though i am a very fair complected
alright the next item i want to talk
about is from violet Voss so this should
come as no surprise but my violet boss
eyeshadow palette in the Holy Grail
version in my opinion has some really
beautiful plum me read and aus we're
just bury tones so if we're focusing
more on this section down here I feel
like you guys can see what I'm talking
about so this one right here is called
Wine and Dine they have a shade called
cranberry splash they have let's see
here on fleek how you doing again all of
these kind of fall into that very
undertone even if they are a little more
on the red side I feel like once they
actually get onto your eyes it really
gives a beautiful beautiful look so here
are all of those shades so watched I
love the formulation on these of I love
boss I shadows I think they are
beautiful some of the mats in here do
tend to be a little dry and chalky this
one down here Wine and Dine is however
if you put it like on the outer veen or
smoke it out on your lower lashline
actually looks stunning and again these
are really nice tones to pair together
so if you do want to do a berry toned
smokey eye or something like that you
can totally go ahead and do that and
then mix it together with a few more of
these warm tones and it doesn't make you
look like you're sick or anything if you
do have very fair skin like I do
sometimes when you wear these kind of
colors you can look maybe slightly ill
because it's like okay that's a whole
lot of red or pink on your face however
when you do mix it together with some of
these warmer tones it looks amazing
alright the next eyeshadow palette I
want to talk about is from the drugstore
this is from the brand profusion this
would be great if you do want a little
bit of a subtle kind of berry look on
the eyes again if you're worried that
you're going to look a little sick if
you put straight up Barry tongues on
this is beautiful so this is from
profusion this is the runway collection
berry blue eye shadow palette this is
what it looks like this is made it
through like three or four declutter
series with me honestly I love this
palette it was 299 at Ulta there are
some swatches for you guys so I will say
it is a little powdery but this is a
really nice way to pull off a very muted
Barry I look so if you don't want this
straight up almost like red or pinky
undertone this is a great way to go
ahead and pull that off you have some
matte colors in here you have some nice
shimmery shades and then you do have
some definer shades at the bottom and
finally the last item I want to talk
about will come as no surprise it is the
honesty of Beverly Hills modern or
Renaissance palette I open this up and I
immediately think like warm very red
plum tones I just love it i think it's
absolutely gorgeous these shades
Venetian red and also love letter are
definitely definitely berry toned colors
as you guys can see and even the shade
red ochre really kind of fits into that
category and this one I feel like it's
kind of similar to the Holy Grail
palette in the sense that it does give
you those nice berry tone colors but if
you don't want to wear them on your own
of course you have all these other
shades that you can go ahead and like
mix them together with so you have all
of these different shades in here it's
beautiful i love this palette I feel
like the mats are super super creamy and
buttery and I do want to say like if you
do have a darker complexion I feel like
these shades will definitely definitely
show up on you if you are a little more
light in the skin tone category like I
am I feel like the runway palette would
give you that beautiful berry I without
being too in-your-face so yeah that is
the last pick alright guys so that is it
for my spotlights color series as far as
Barry tones are concerned definitely let
me know down below what your favorite
Berry tone to make up products are and
let me know what color you guys want me
to do next I was thinking rose gold
might be fun so yeah anyway that is it
guys I will see you on my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
