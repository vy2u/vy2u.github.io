started with the swatches the first one
we're going to start this way and go
this way so that first one that kind of
like red wine color is called cheers and
it is a matte and it's really really
beautiful i would say it's kind of like
a wine color um with like like just a
true almost red undertone it is really
beautiful love it the one next to that
one is called tuxedo which is a hot hot
hot pink and this is a hyper glossy so
it's got a little more Sheen to it
that's the color in the tube and it's
the second one on my arm right there the
third one that kind of nude color is
called cookie and I'm actually wearing
that on my lips today um it's like a
matte I would say like light topi brown
color it is really really beautiful it
is the third one right there the fourth
one is 22 and this is a mat deep deep
deep burgundy it almost has like a deep
cherry undertone to it it's really
really something it's gorgeous um and
that is the fourth one right there the
next one there is called lady which is a
matte color oh this has a little more
brown in it i'd say so it looks like
that
beautiful there so true to the packaging
color and the last one is called
confetti and this is a hyper glossy and
this is like a deep true red and that is
the sixth son on my arm right there so

just have a gorgeous like the hyper
glossy ones have just a gorgeous
