I'm doing a review and I have some
swatches for you guys on the color pop
color pop what are these called again
super shock cheek products so this is
the blush line that just came out from
colour-pop and I picked up five
different shades as you guys can see it
I thought that that would give me a nice
variety of different colors I got three
brights and then to kind of neutral
shades and yeah in the box came this
little tip card i'm going to read this
to you guys because i think it's really
important a lot of people when they got
to their super shock eyeshadows didn't
know that they have to close these
really tightly it's the same exact thing
with the blushes you really really need
to close the cap tightly because these
will dry out let me just read for you
guys some of the stuff that they stay on
this card it says super shocked cheek
this long reign creme powder blush is
the BFF art of our infamous super shock
shadow it shares the shadows unique
buoyant texture and feel super silky
cheeks look healthy and flawless
supershot cheek comes in mats and satin
finishes our blushes are available in a
ton of shades from natural nudes to not
avions get cheeky experiment and play
and that says tips and tricks so i would
keep this card fiber you guys i think at
first don't quote me on this but i think
at first they didn't really have like
the information on closing the caps
tightly and people were trying to like
deep hot the eyeshadows and you know
that's when they started to realize that
they were getting really dry these like
remind me of like play-doh almost they
actually kind of smell like play-doh to
which i don't like but um they're so
like you know like you can just leave an
indent it's just like the if you have
the super shocked shadows you know what
i'm talking about but they are super
super pigmented obviously but it's just
one of those things where it's like kind
of common sense like don't try and
depart your cream products because
unless you're storing them like with a
like huge lid on that's like helping to
make sure that you know um there's still
like moisture within the thing which i
don't even think you could do would say
like Ozzy palette or something I don't
you think that's possible but just use
you know common knowledge and the fact
that these are cream products and you
need to close them tightly so that they
don't dry out um so anyway let me brief
you guys what they say about tips and
tricks fingertips will provide the
highest amount of coverage I do you
agree with that today I am wearing the
shade thumper which is this beautiful
cool tone medium pink I applied it with
a elf small stippling brush which is
personally my favorite way to apply it
it goes on really really sheer but you
can build it up um but I do agree that
the fingertips give the highest amount
of coverage you can pat it in I just
find that my fingertips can't blend very
well especially if I already have powder
and all that stuff on so I confer using
my ELF smell stipple it says brush
suggestions you can use a flat synthetic
cheek or foundation brush or a short duo
fiber brush flat synthetic brush will
give more coverage in the duo fiber
brush will give more of a sheer
airbrushed effect it says color builds
from natural looking finish looks into
more intense bright looks built to your
heart's desire and then it says when
finished close that sucker up tight
don't leave the jar open for long
periods of time you may lose some of the
magic that makes these super shop cheeks
so amazing it is also just you guys know
these products are made in the city of
the angels so they are in the USA they
are made in Los Angeles their cruelty
free also so that's great um keep these
little cards when you get them I mean
you don't have to just make sure you
read them you don't need to keep the
card but make sure you read them because
a lot of brands sometimes you get like
something and you think oh well I'm just
going to do whatever I want with it I'm
gonna keep on throwing a Z palette but
they really state here that you know
it's important to keep them in their
cases so I don't know if I mentioned the
price already these are eight dollars on
the colour-pop website and they have
such a variety of finishes I happen to
get on matte colors um but they have a
variety of finishes and they also have
just a huge variety of colors like
really really bright really really
neutrals just really really great stuff
so here are the swatches i'm going to
show you guys which colors i got this
first one right here which is like a
bright orange is called tonic and this
is a matte it's really really beautiful
it's super super super opaque and i
think it will be beautiful during this
time
the next color is this cool tone medium
pink this is called thumper that is the
one I'm wearing today the next color is
this magenta one it's called homie it's
also a matte these are all maths really
beautiful the next one is disappear pure
like deep coral color it is called
clutch looks like that and the last
color I got to mochi which looks like
that so as you guys can see these two
right here look really similar I did not
realize that when i was on the website I
really thought that this one looked a
lot more warm than this one it is still
a little more warm than this one but
they're really similar so I'm a little
bummed out that that happened but um I
would say if you are on the website
really really take a good look at them
put the brightness up all the way on
your computer so you can really see what
you're getting but those are the
swatches and yeah I have to say really
like these products I think it's really
nice to have a cream product that you
can really like build up on your cheeks
it's not something that slippery it's a
beautiful beautiful beautiful coverage
is just everything is gorgeous it feels
like butter like you just dip your
finger in and you get so much color and
it's just so soft and it's a pleasure to
work with products like these so I'm
really really happy I will probably end
up picking up some of the satin finished
ones maybe some more neutral colors and
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this review
and swatches video a thumbs up if you
did and I'll see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
