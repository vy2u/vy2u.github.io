my channel today's video is going to be
a quick little comparison on the new
color pop I think I love you palette
versus the color pop yes please palette
so I did order these for $16 apiece on
the color pop calm a website did these
r12 pan palettes so each palette does
have 12 different pans of eyeshadow in
it and this is what the outer packaging
looks like I definitely prefer this one
right here even though it's super hard
to photograph and very very hard to film
with because has so much flashback I
just think this is a really pretty
layout and I love the kind of fall vibes
that I'm getting from this copper
interior but right here you guys can see
this is very very cheap cardboard I mean
these are $16 I sixteen dollar eyeshadow
palettes so I don't expect too much when
it comes to that but they don't have a
mirror or anything like that however I
find that these are very very travel
friendly here is the what's at the yes
please outer packaging looks like I
don't like that it's white because it's
been getting a super super dirty you
guys can see right there I fell it's
super messy but they do have a little
sticker on the back of each and it shows
you the names they are like kind of
backwards so I just wanted to give you
guys a heads up on that but yeah twelve
pan palettes for $16 apiece on it the
color pop calm a website so the I think
I love you pal it does have three
different mats it has one glitter in
eight different shimmers which is a lot
of shimmer now when it does come it to
the yes please palette this guy does
have eight different mats it has three
shimmers and one press of the litter and
now I personally am preferring what's
going on here with the yesplease palette
and out of the two of these palettes
this is the one that I would recommend
to you guys and let me walk you through
why so when you open up in the yesplease
palette as you guys can see you're
getting a lot of interesting warm tones
shades here now I haven't necessarily
particularly been loving this a really
really warm toned a theme or trend that
has been going on with eyeshadows
however I really love mixing this
together with any other palette and if
you're curious about what I have on my
eyes today it's actually the two of
these palettes mixed together I would
say if you do happy 30 or $32 to go
ahead and spend I would recommend
purchasing both of these you're gonna
get a really nice assortment of
different finishes as well as different
colors that this is obviously a lot more
of a neutral tone palette whereas this
one kinda reminds me of
it's summertime heat kind of thing but
today when I did pair at these pals
together I really liked the look that I
came out with I feel like it's very fall
toned kind of vibe and I just think it's
really nice so if you are curious I did
use this guy as my transition today I
did go in with this kind of burnt orange
shade as well as this bright orange
shade and I work those into my outer-v
and then as far as my lower lashline and
lid are concerned I jumped into the
color pop I think I love you because I
feel like there are so many shimmers in
here and they're really really nice to
go ahead and tap onto the lid or smoke
out on the lower lash line I use this
guy right here on my lower lash line and
then I did take this guy and put that
all over my lid so the one downfall with
this particular palette is really just
like how many shippers are in here I
feel like they can be a little more
difficult to work into the crease you
definitely need a little more densely
packed of brushes and my favorites to
blend it these guys out are definitely
like the morphe I'm five-eleven or
morphe M what is the M 5:13 brush also
the Sigma X 35 or a 35 brush is really
really fantastic as well for these guys
right here but do you think a lot of
people are not going to love this
because these definitely are more kind
of topper shades especially these ones
that have a lot of pigment to them
they're super super soft and buttery and
you definitely need to go ahead and pair
a nice sticky tacky primer with these
guys now one thing I want to say about
both palettes overall is that these give
up a lot of powder now I recently talked
about the color pop yes please any video
talking about kind of messy palettes
which I'll go ahead and throw up in the
cards for you guys these pick up almost
the same amount of powder as these
subcultural palette so if you are not
into that you are not going to like
either of these palettes I definitely
notice that the matte palette over here
or the ones that have more mattes in
here which is the yesplease palette
definitely pick up a lot of powder
they're very very messy so that's just a
little bit of a heads up but as far as
pairing the two of these together I
really think that's the best way to go
because you're getting so many neutrals
here and then you're getting nice and
warm tone shades here and a little bit
of interesting colors as well like those
mustard yellow shades so I definitely
think if you do have the money I would
go ahead and purchase both but if I had
to pick one you guys I would say the yes
please is my favorite and again I'm not
really into like these bright bright
dammit my got a card filled up sorry
about the little jump cut you guys but
what
I was trying to say about this
particular palette is that I'm not
necessarily super into those warm tone
vibes but I feel like when you do pair
together with other palettes like the I
think I love you palette you are able to
get a different sort of look so it
doesn't necessarily have to be super
outrageous in like bright bold kind of
flame looks you definitely can cool it
down a little bit with this palette so
let's go ahead and starts watching you
guys um I guess I will start to I think
I love you palette the first thing I
want to swatch is this gold right here
now this particular shade is called
bitter better and it is a soft metallic
gold it is really beautiful and these
are so so so so soft and buttery so I
really want to let you guys know you
kind of have to pack these onto the lid
what I would recommend doing with these
is really packing it on with your actual
finger so like I picked it up with my
middle finger is how I would literally
pack it onto my lid I don't find that
these adhere too well with a brush and
you definitely if you want really really
wham bam in-your-face sort of impact I
would go in with a glitter glue but for
the most part I'm able to just have
these on with my finger and they stay
all day and I don't have any issue so
and that is the first day from the I
think I love you palette it is called
bitter better next up we do have a
naturally called Ben bel-air which is a
matte cool toned taupe color
now the mattes in these palettes are
just really really beautiful I love the
pigmentation I love that you can do like
a once white finger swatch and literally
just get beautiful beautiful color
payoff so that is what these shade of
bel-air looks like it's a little too
deep to be a true transition for my
particular skin tone but if you do have
a deeper skin tone and I think you would
enjoy that
alright guys up next we have fancy face
which is a metallic a bright red copper
that is the guy that I have on my lower
lash line today I wouldn't necessarily
say it's a bright red but it definitely
has a little bit of cranberry tones
going on in there again it has that
beautiful soft shimmery sort of finish
to it super super soft and buttery and I
mean this one is just absolutely
gorgeous as you guys can probably see
alright and then finally we have
metallic golden bronze which is called
the girls bite and again I wouldn't
necessarily call this golden I feel like
this is more of like a topi a bronze
color but it really really is beautiful
and again it has that creamy a buttery
beautiful beautiful pigmentation at
level to it so that is the first row of
the I think I love you--as palette
moving on let's go ahead and
watch the second row I'm going to start
with the shade howdy now howdy is the
metallic red bronze this one definitely
does have a little more red to it than
this guy right here but I wouldn't say
it does red as this guy I don't know
some of the names in here I'm just like
are you sure are you sure about that for
some of the descriptions of the actual
colors but here is what this particular
shade it looks like again this one is
called howdy really really beautiful and
the next one that we have is called
rowdy this is actually a norm matte
ivory they say and honestly that's just
not true whatsoever this actually does
have a glitter infused into it and it's
hella powdery so I just wanted to give
you guys a little bit of a heads up it
is what kind of kind of used as my face
today it's kind of set all over my lid
but that is what the shade looks like it
does have small glitter particles in it
just to give you guys a little bit of a
heads up but it still is really
beautiful all right up next we have the
shade in my treat which is a metallic
champagne Avery this one is beautiful I
think you could obviously use this as a
highlight as well if you wanted to it
definitely has a little bit of pink and
peachy coal to reflex in there it's just
absolutely stunning but it's not like
chunky and you know super super glittery
in any way shape or form it's just a
beautiful metallic I sort of pearl eyes
color and finish and then finally we
have a level up which is a metallic
bright penny copper shade and I think
that is definitely a good good rundown
of what the shade actually looks like
because it's just absolutely gorgeous
that is what I have today all over my
lid so those are the first two rows in
the color pop I think I love you palette
let me go ahead and remove at those
swatches quickly and then we will jump
into the last row so the last row is
starting with a shade called screw it
which is a metallic soft rose gold I
love this shade I think it is really
really beautiful definitely and here is
what it looks like so it has more up
like those dopey vibes to it not so much
like super super rose gold but that's
okay I mean color pop you know you do
you you do you whatever you feel like it
is that's okay so let's go ahead and
swatch that one this one is definitely
very soft and metallic sized as well and
it doesn't have any sort of yucky chunky
nuts to it this one really glides on
beautifully started my hands a little
red that's what happens when I wipe it
but that is what it looks like and just
so you guys know I just wiped it off
with a dry towel as well so that there
is no remaining water on my hand
if you guys I've received where people
swatch it and then there's like
remaining I'm like a little bit of
wetness and it just glides on
beautifully
this one actually clients on beautifully
without water all right up next guys do
we have a true map to black now this is
the worst matte black I've ever tried
but it's also not the best I do feel
like corrupt from makeup geek is better
but this is pretty damn good so here is
what it looks like it's called let's do
it
let me go ahead and swatch that for you
guys I was it felt like a matte blacks
have never been amazing but this one is
not horrible but it's also not the best
matte black I've ever tried and then
finally we have rule breaker which is a
metallic a bright yellow gold this is
what a rule breaker it looks like it's
beautiful but it did definitely has a
little more chunkiness to it just want
to give you guys a heads up with this
guy I don't know if it's just because of
the color if this is the harder kind of
color to bind together but there's a
little bit of you know when you swatch
it you can see a little bit of like
seats are going on there I need to do a
few swipes back and forth to even get
something to kind of show up here but
there's maybe a little bit of glitter
reflex in here and it doesn't
necessarily go on super smooth now I
would recommend actually packing this
one on with a you know densely packed a
brush that definitely has a little bit
of wetness on it already just because
this does kind of fall out and you have
a little bit of fallout all over your
face in fact one thing I want to say
about the I think I love you palette in
general is just that a lot of the
shimmers in your do you have a lot of
Fallout you will experience follow -
maybe oh I had to put your eye makeup on
first before your foundation but that is
what that yellow color looks like which
is called rule breaker and then finally
we have my type which is a Mac - deep
saddle at Brown and this one is really
really beautiful again I love the mattes
in these palettes I just think they're
absolutely fantastic so there it is so
anyway that is the I think I love you
palette all swatch tout I think it's
great so really really nice neutral
palette if you are someone who really
does enjoy those beautiful beautiful
colors during at the fall time I think
you're going to love it if you want
something neutral that you can wear to
work I personally have worn this to work
I haven't had any issues nobody said
anything it looks very neutral and
beautiful and I really do enjoy it
alright let's go ahead and swatch out
the yesplease palette now guys we are
going to start with the shade full zip
which is a matte warm ivory now that is
what it looks like right here and as
beautiful as like a base color I feel
like this is just really really nice
this particular palette because you can
use this if you're
very fair complected and then you can
use this one if you're a little deeper
in skintone and just use it as an
all-over base so I really like this
shade right here let me go ahead and
swatch it out for you guys so here is
what that one looks like it's definitely
lighter than my skin tone as you guys
can see the next one that we have here
is called Vega cocktails this is a matte
orange and it really is this is one that
I worked into my outer-v today before
continuing on and you know working at
that deeper kind of birth' orange shade
but it's gorgeous you guys I love the
pigmentation on this I love the way it
blends I mean the mats are just
incredible I know I keep saying the same
thing over and over but the map through
these pallets are great alright
moving on we have champs which is a
matte pale peachy nude this is my
favorite transition for sure one of the
things about the I think I love you
palette is that one thing I don't love
about it is the fact that it doesn't
really have a true transition for a very
very fair skin tone so I just wanted to
give you guys a heads up there is that
peachy kind of shade I hope it's showing
up okay I'm trying to be good with doing
swatches on it the DSLR you guys know
I've been working with this camera a
little more so I'm hoping that
everything is showing up alright and
then finally we have a bling which is a
metallic rust and this one's more of
like a cranberry rust I don't know I
feel like I want to rename these ballots
I just want to rename these ballots I'm
like I don't I don't really know I never
they know what they're thinking here but
that is what it looks like all right
guys let's go ahead and move on to the
second row in the yes it please a
palette so the first shade I would like
to start with is this guy right here
this is a really really interesting kind
of salmony cranberry color that's how I
would describe it but it's called Louie
and they describe it as a metallic
duochrome red with a gold flip maybe
that's a better indication it definitely
has a little bit of a gold flip and the
dual chrome is actually quite a nice
consistency it's really not bad
whatsoever so if you worked with jewel
crumbs before and you felt like it they
were like a little harder to get your
brush into these are not too bad again I
preferred what the duo chromes to kind
of tap it on with my finger but forgot
this was a duo groan didn't I say that
this was a chipper it reminds me of a
shipper because it goes on like a
shimmer all right up next we have a
really really chunky gold color right
here this guy is called a butter cake it
is a metallic pale yellow gold and
espect definitely has a little bit of
chunkiness in it it really reminds me of
at the consistency of this guy right
here from the yesplease palette so
doesn't
you guys a little bit of a heads up you
definitely need to pack this one on with
like a wet brush or like what your
finger before going in and then also I
would definitely recommend you see maybe
a glitter glue with that guy a little
trouble Samet not my favorite
up next we do have these sheets foil
which is a matte brick red I love this
color it's beautiful it's solid it's not
too red to make you look sick in the eye
area it's just really really gorgeous it
has a little bit of like a salmony
undertone to it and then finally the
last row that we have here is called new
and this one is a matte burnt orange
again this is the one that I worked in
two of my outer-v
with that brighter orange shade so there
it is I hope that these mats are
swatching as well as they go on because
they really go on to the eyes
beautifully I feel like they give the
perfect amount of pigment without
looking too overdone and you can just
kind of build it up on the eyes I don't
notice that I get as much fallout with
this particular palette because the maps
don't give me as much fallout they give
me a lot of kick up when I put my brush
in there but the shimmers are the ones
that give me more fallout so I hope that
that makes sense
now let's go ahead and jump into the
last row here guys we are going to start
with this a bright yellow right here
this is a well they describe it as a mat
form yellow I feel like it's bright
yellow it's called mischief and it
really is beautiful it's kind of I don't
know I'm a huge fan of yellow eyeshadows
that kind of just remind me of like this
for some reason but I mean if you want a
good matte yellow eyeshadow this is this
is the palette you want to go for I know
a lot of people say that this is they do
for the you Tasha - no no sunset
palettes I have no idea I will never try
the sunset palette ish is way too
expensive for me personally I just can't
I can't justify it I'd rather buy two or
three pallets or like seven for philipot
for that price um but I think it's
beautiful this is what I really wish the
honey butter shade from the Too Faced
what was that peanut butter and honey
palette would have been like and then up
and next we have this guy right here
which is a note to self which is a warm
a caramel brown that's a good
description it's definitely a good
description I'm sorry my hands are
getting all red finally guys that we
have chauffeur which is a Metallica duo
chrome bright orange with a goal to flip
I don't even know if I would describe
this as a duo car I mean I get it
I can see that there's a shift but for
me they really just go on like shippers
so that's kind of why I'm describing
them as shippers but there's that shade
and then finally we have French kiss
which is a nap deep a read at Brown this
is a true kind of wine color it's really
really gorgeous so there it is a little
bit of kick up and fall out with that
one but yeah there are the shades for
the yes please like I said I really
really enjoy the both of them but I do
prefer the s please over the I think I
love you palette if you're someone who
already has a matte palette at home that
you would like to incorporate some more
shimmers into you can definitely
purchase the I think I love you because
there's so many nice toppers in here for
your lid as well as colors that you can
smoke out on your lower lashline but
just be aware that these do you have a
lot of fall out to know when it comes to
the yesplease palette really really
beautiful warm tone shades here you can
mix them together with other sort of
palettes so you can get a little more of
a cool tone vibe or a mid tone vibe sort
of things so that it's not too warm
toned and then the one thing I want to
say about this is just that the max do
have a lot of kick up but they don't
necessarily have fallout so I hope this
little comparison was helpful to you
guys I'm like I said definitely prefer
the yes please over the I think I love
you but I think they paired together
beautifully let me know if you picked up
any of the color pop up press eyes
shadow palettes I would love to know
down below and I guess I will see you
guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
