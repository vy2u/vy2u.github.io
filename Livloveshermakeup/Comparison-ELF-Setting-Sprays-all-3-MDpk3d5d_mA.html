today's video is going to be a
comparison on all three of the elf
illuminate not illuminating the elf
makeup mist in specs there is an
illuminating version this is 4 dollars
there is also a matte magic formula that
is also 4 dollars and then the original
one is 3 dollars because it's the old
one but honestly it's the goodie in my
opinion so I have been using this
particular one and this is the makeup
mist inset with a low green tea cucumber
vitamins A C and E I have been using
this since I was 18 this was the first
makeup setting spray I ever tried in my
life and it still is my favourites so I
will say that right away is that out of
all three of these I would say the
original one is the best I like it the
most it does you know you get two point
zero two fluid ounces in here so
compared to maybe the urban decay or
pixie or Smashbox you don't get as much
products but again three dollars and I
feel like it does the same exact thing
as the Urban Decay ones or the pixie
ones I want to let you in on a little
trick that I like to do I don't really
know if it's a trick let me know if you
guys do this as well but with setting
sprays I don't just use them to set my
makeup I actually will use them before I
put my foundation on my concealer my
face products just because I feel like
they make the makeup like that you put
on top of it adhere to your skin better
so I personally with any like makeup
setting spray I was going to say with
primer I personally with any makeup
setting spray will go ahead and spray it
all over my face after I have applied my
primer and then I will let it set into
my skin completely and go in with my
foundation and then after you've applied
my whole face of makeup I will go back
in and actually set my makeup with it I
feel like that makes any setting spray
work better in my opinion it really just
makes the product it here and I
personally really like that so if for
some reason you're noticing that your
setting sprays are not working as well
as you would like them to they're not
extending the wear of your makeup try
using it like that
alright so out of the three in my
opinion I really really like the
original one of the best I think it
makes your makeup wear the longest and I
don't notice that I get greasy and I
don't notice that I get to matte so
between the two of these ones the matte
magic and the illuminating these are
both really really great as well
they have
sort of sent to them I feel like they're
kind of the same sort of texture but
it's very very hard to describe the
illuminating one I believe may have a
little bit of oil in here because when I
spray it onto my face it feels similar
to my Tasha luminous dewy skin mist not
as oily is that but it feels similar and
that would make sense since it is in the
lumen ating mist and set however I do
notice because there is probably a
little bit of oil in there it does
actually kind of go against what what it
is supposed to do so any oil on your
skin will usually make your makeup
break-up throughout the day so for me
personally I would say when I use the
original one my makeup will last 1012
hours really really nicely with this one
I would say only about six to eight
hours with the illuminating one now on
the other hand it does feel really nice
when it goes on and I noticed that I
don't get like dry looking in certain
areas like where I have fine lines
around my eyes and my mouth area
they look nice and plumped up which
would make sense because I feel like the
illuminating one has the most beneficial
like hydrating properties in it so I
feel like the original one just has
basically will just extend the wear of
your makeup I don't really know if
there's a below and creatine cucumber
and vitamins A seen in here but I just
feel like it's a good spray that makes
my makeup last longer and extends the
wear whereas the illuminating one I do
feel like it puts a little moisture into
my skin which I do like however I notice
that I do start to get oily in my t-zone
I do have combo skin and also it will
start to break up on certain areas like
I said where I find lines around my nose
it will start to break up a little
quicker than the original one now the
two of these against each other the Matt
magic and the illuminating obviously the
Matt magic is going to make your skin
appear a little more matte I don't feel
like it does an amazing job by any means
I don't think you spray it on and it
sucks like moisture out of your skin it
doesn't work like that like if you're
oily and you're hoping to spray this and
it will get rid of oil it's not going to
do that but it is going to help to
prevent you from breaking down like oil
throughout the day if that makes sense
so your skin will break down the sebum
and it will start to show this will help
keep it in check so I do like it however
the only con is that it is matte so if
you spray too much and you
you let it set and then you look in the
mirror 10 minutes later you might notice
that areas like your fine lines or your
wrinkles might look a little more
emphasized they may look a little more
dry because this is basically like
adhering to the makeup and making it
stay on there whereas like the
illuminating one I feel like actually
plumps up the fine lines and wrinkles in
a way because it has like whatever's in
here I think it has some oil in it this
one is going to not take away the oil in
your skin but it's going to make sure
that no oil breaks through and I
personally throughout the day like I
said I did get oily in my t-zone but
after I wear my foundation for a good 4
to 5 hours I personally think the areas
where I do have fine lines tend to look
a little better than when I've just
applied my makeup and the reason for
that is is because I do have some oil
breakthrough coming through and it kind
of just I mean sometimes it can
emphasize them obviously when you're
moving your face like you're going to
get those little makeups creasing lines
but at the same time it kind of makes
them look glossy and plumped up whereas
when I first powder my face I feel like
they're very very emphasized so that's
something to think about I do think that
the Matt magic spray does keep me
relatively matte throughout the day I
really like it in my t-zone but overall
I will say if I'm having a really dry
skin day and especially on my cheek area
like I don't use this because it will
make my makeup look a little rough in
texture on my skin so overall between
all three of these I would recommend
just going and getting the original one
I like it the most it smells pretty darn
good I don't know sometimes it smells
good sometimes it doesn't
I wonder if sometimes my bottle goes bad
but like I said you only get two point
zero two fluid ounces in here however it
is only three dollars so I would go
ahead and purchase this one it's the
original one I think it's amazing I like
the little spray never starts to squirt
unevenly I did have that problem with
the illuminating one but I don't know
every single bottle of the original one
I've never had an issue with so I think
this one prolongs and extends the wear
of your makeup the longest and the
illuminating one will kind of give you a
more dewy appearing appearance but it
will also break your makeup down a
little quicker and then the Matt magic
one
and actually overemphasize dry areas on
your face but it will prolong the wear
of your makeup but not as well as the
original one I still think this one is
the best so anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed this video definitely let me
know if you also are one of those people
that use setting sprays after your
primers before your foundation I'm
curious because I see a lot of people do
like makeup looks or tutorials where
they just use the settings right after
and I'm like you know and I feel like
photos what was it photo finish from
Smashbox or whatever voting finish
Smashbox by Smashbox photo-finish is is
that it oh my gosh I should probably dig
it out now I don't remember what it is I
think it's the photo finish setting
spray I feel like that opened people's
eyes or the primer water my goodness the
primer water that's what opened people's
eyes to like oh I can use this to prime
my face too
I feel like any setting spray can
actually technically prime your face so
also if you're in a hurry you can always
just use the setting spray instead of a
primer so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video thank you so much for joining me
and I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
