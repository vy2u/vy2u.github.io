my channel today's video is going to be
part two in my consistent versus
unreliable makeup brand series I am very
excited because I have not filmed one of
these in a very long time I am so
 sorry
it literally just got away from me I am
the queen of starting new series on my
channel if you guys haven't figured that
out already so what I'm thinking of
doing is making one of these videos a
month let me know what you think of that
down below but yeah I will go ahead and
link the first one at which I filmed I
think back in January I'll go ahead and
throw that video up in the cards for you
guys if you would like to check it out
just so you know there's a lot of vulgar
language in that video and that is
because I was superheated I was talking
about Too Faced and tarts and you guys
know lately I have found them to be very
very inconsistent and just really really
unreliable so that is why it's a little
more graphic in that video um but yeah
we're gonna go ahead and just jump into
today's video we are talking about a
drugstore brands we're gonna talk about
Physicians Formula we're going to talk
about Milani wet and wild and also
Maybelline so let's go ahead and jump
right into it the first brand I want to
talk about is Physicians of formula so
Physicians Formula in my opinion is
actually an unreliable brand now a lot
of people will say but don't you love
the brand don't you love these products
yes I love these products right here but
just because you like a few products
from a brand doesn't necessarily mean
you love the brand I do like what they
stand for I know that it was a doctor
who created this line for his wife who
had very sensitive skin I think that's
wonderful I think that's beautiful and I
also do love that they are a
cruelty-free brand from the drugstore
however their color options their shade
selections absolutely suck if you are a
nubian goddess if you are a pale
princess forget about it you are not
going to be able to use their
foundations their concealers or powders
everything to me it really seems like it
is catered to those with a medium
complexion and I think that is so
 stupid you know if you release
something like this and they do really
really well why on earth do you only
have two shades to choose from you know
you would think that brands you know
when they really start to do something
and it really takes off they kind of
milk that think of like two faced
with a sweet beach collection they are
milking that you know now they're
doing like a peaches and cream
collection it's one of those things
where you would think Physicians Formula
would want to go and open up even more
shades to that
like a deeper complexion can go ahead
and pick one of these bronzers not but
they haven't done that and I feel like
even with their new blush formula they
released two shades at once and then on
their Instagram they said we're
releasing two more shades and I'm like
really four shades you think
that's that special like I just don't
understand why can't they can even out
their collection and expand more of
their shade selection so that's really
the only thing that I don't like about
Physicians Formula that is why I am
putting putting them into the unreliable
category really just because I think
that their shade selection is really
really horrendous for very very light
skin tones and very very dark skin tones
alright let's go ahead and get into a
consistent brand we're going to be
talking about two wet and wild so when
wild is one of those brands that I feel
like really excelled to the past couple
of years and they just keep on and going
the only thing that I find a little
disappointing with wet and wild products
is probably their limited-edition
collections now I have this little guy
right here it's called spoiled brat this
may actually be from the permanent
collection I think this is a limited
edition collection yeah this is plaid to
the bone this is one of their little
trios I'm not saying that these aren't
good quality I think that they're
limited-edition collections tend to be a
little bit on the weaker side compared
to like they're more permanent line but
what I notice is that they are very much
like mac cosmetics with their limited
edition collections there is like new
 practically every other week and I
just wish they would kind of slow down
and take more time to add things into
their permanent line that is really the
only thing that I find disappointing
with the wet-and-wild brand I think that
their price range in general is below
where it should be one thing that I wish
they would also work on is the fact that
I do think they have really really cheap
packaging and I understand it's because
there's such a cheap of brand and I just
mean sheep as in price not in quality
because their quality is absolutely
phenomenal but you know the packaging I
can never ever travel with anything like
this these break they shatter really
really easily I know a lot of people say
like oh my god when I travel with Becca
stuff my stuff you know shatters right
away I don't notice that at all except
for when I do travel with I'm
wet-and-wild products I just can't
travel with them that packaging is
really really cheap I feel like because
the quality is so good even if they just
added a dollar or do on to the price tag
and really I'm kind of like upgraded
their packaging that would be maybe a
little nicer but overall quality is
amazing they aren't excelling and doing
so well because they
releasing stop for a fraction of the
price and really really good quality so
they're releasing bakelite highlighters
they're releasing beautiful buttery
eyeshadows and I'm just all about that I
think they are doing so fantastic and
they are definitely a consistent brand
in my opinion I just really wish they
would work on packaging and also I wish
they would work on not releasing so many
limited-edition collections like Mac all
right now let's go ahead and talk about
Maybelline Maybelline is a very
inconsistent brand in my opinion the
first thing I want to talk about is the
fact that I feel like they are trying so
hard right now like so hard to stay up
to date with all of like the younger
generation I feel like these like beauty
gurus that are doing these commercials
and stuff like that I'm not even trying
to throw shade to anyone but those
commercials are cringy I think
we can all agree on that
I just feel like they are trying
insanely insanely hard right now and I
don't think that's an attractive thing
with a brand when brands really start to
focus in on social media and like you
know getting other people to promote
their products that actually is a huge
turnoff for me personally that makes me
think of like the morphe brand that
makes me think of brands that are like
Instagram famous I really don't
personally like that and again that's
just a personal thing but yeah I find
like their new marketing scheme kind of
crunchy what they do best in my opinion
are foundations I think they do primers
really well I think they do lip products
really well but they need to even out of
their collection I hate that they keep
releasing these like new to palettes or
whatever when they're really really
shitty quality I feel like they just
keep releasing the same bad stuff over
and over and over again so just because
you release a palette with five
different um you know like a different
color schemes to it doesn't mean that
it's good quality I think the blush
nudes palette was okay I ended up
decluttering it but the original nudes
palette the rock nudes all of those are
really really shitty in my opinion and
another thing I want to say is for me
personally I do not like their face
palettes I know a lot of people do so
this is really really personal
preference right here but I feel like
they're just really really pushing their
palettes right now and for me personally
$15.99 for a semi-decent kind of face
palette or something that's completely
 as far as eyeshadow is concerned I
would rather spend another 15 dollars
and go get myself a nice palette at
Sephora so for me I'm just kind of like
you know what I feel like they're all
over the place they need to work on
quality control and another thing I want
to touch on is the fact that their
foundations pull such a strong yellow
undertone it's very difficult for those
of us with a cool undertone
able to find something that will match
us I do think that their color selection
is a lot better than say Physicians
Formula they do cater to the pretty dark
into the pretty light but overall I feel
like L'Oreal foundations pull really
pink and Maybelline foundations pull
really yellow let me know if you agree
with that so yeah overall for Maybelline
I just think they need to work on
quality control an evening out their
collection because they can make good
products but right now I feel like
they're really really pushing the stuff
that they're not good at alright and
finally let's go ahead and talk about
Milani you guys I'm so excited I love
Milani I feel like Milani is a great
brand because they do not over produce
their products they do not push them
they do not like to shove them down your
throat on social media they're just one
of those brands where the majority of
the products that I try for them I'm
very very impressed with I would say the
stuff that they do best are definitely
their blushes they have a very diverse
nice color range and selection and I
think that's wonderful they have shades
like red vino which will show up
beautifully on deeper skin tones you
know this is gonna be a beautiful blush
on deeper skin tones they have this
shade you know Luminoso which is really
really well known for being extremely
extremely flattering on all sorts of
different skin tones they have really
nice shades like this one right here
which is called coralina which is
beautiful on fair skin tones I really
like the brand and I really like that
they don't over produce products now one
thing I want to say is that also they're
kind of into this baked thing and you
guys know I'm not super into this baked
trend I talked about in my brands I'm
getting bored with video which I'll go
ahead and throw up in the cards for you
guys I talked about Laura Geller and how
I'm like oh my god it's just baked baked
baked over and over again what I like
about Milani is they do other stuff you
know they do lip products but they don't
call it like baked souffle like you know
Laura got around literally all of our
products are like big big bags so I
really like that Milani gets away from
that they do mo sago powders they do
different sorts of blushes they have
those beautiful beautiful rose blushes
as well and overall I would say the only
thing that I think has been a Miss from
them thus far is probably the fact that
they release those foundations and the
shade selection was not too good but you
know what they went back in they worked
on their quality control and then
they've rereleased even more shades and
I just feel like when a brand is willing
to do that I've heard that still the
lightest shade is still too dark but
still when a brand is willing to go
ahead and do that and listen to their
audience I think that is such a big
thing and I really appreciate that they
again don't over produce product they
don't push it into your face now one
thing I also want to say is that I feel
like they kind of do have
special packaging again if wet-and-wild
just charged two or three dollars more
and had packaging more like this I would
really like that I'm not saying that I
love like the little brush that you get
at the bottom but I do love having a
mirror I like having the little compact
I love having this nice like click
closure it really makes me feel like I'm
using a more luxurious product and
that's just something that I really like
I feel like it's not too overdone it's
not too childish it's nice and sleek and
classy and I really enjoy that so anyway
guys I hope you guys enjoyed this video
thank you so much for joining me
definitely let me know down below if you
think these brands are inconsistent or
if you think they are I'm sorry if you
think they're consistent or if you think
they're unreliable and yeah that is
pretty much it thank you so much for
joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
