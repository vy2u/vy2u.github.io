channel today's video is going to be my
third installment in my consistent
versus unreliable makeup brand series so
I like to do these videos because it's
an easy way for me to talk about brands
and let you guys know if I think they're
consistent inconsistent unreliable or
reliable whatever so today we are
talking about anasazi of Beverly Hills
we're going to talk about urban decay
we're going to talk about Benefit
Cosmetics as well as Stila
so let's go ahead and start with honest
hacia Beverly Hills Anasazi Beverly
Hills in my opinion is a very very
consistent brand now I know some people
do not feel that way though I feel like
they're I shadow Pella formula their
glow kids their lip products are just so
frickin spectacular so some of my
favorite items are definitely be Nicole
Guerrero glow kit as well as the Sun
dipped it glow kit the actual formula on
these locusts do vary from one to the
other so this one right here which is
the scented kalokhe it really really has
a very I guess you could say foils sort
of texture to it it goes onto the skin
and gorgeously kind of like you just
have with a strip of shimmer with no
glitter whatsoever and then the Nicole
Guerrero one does have a little more I
guess a grip to it I don't want to say
that it feels chunky or anything like
that but people do notice a little more
shimmer or glitter on their cheeks when
they use it but I still really love it I
think it's beautiful
they also have you know some boon
translocate which again is a completely
different a formula but still so
beautiful and then you have the aurora
glow kit again it's different formulas
still really beautiful so I feel like
Anasazi of arveleï Hills in general is
just super consistent all of those
locusts even though they do have
different formulas really really
impressed me and they're a lip product
oh my goodness I've never tried their
liquid lipsticks but their lip glosses
are incredibly pigmented literally more
pigmented than some of these lipsticks
that I have in my collection I also do
have their honest hacia Beverly Hills
lip palette incredibly impressed with
that as well so overall you guys I would
say Anasazi Beverly Hills is a very very
consistent brand and I'm really happy
with everything that I purchased from
them I have not turned out any of their
eyeshadow singles about the modern or
Renaissance Palace like the formula and
there is just absolutely superb and
spectacular so I just can't say enough
good things about honest Athiya Beverly
Hills
alright next we have urban decay I'm
going to have to say urban decay is
definitely a consistent brand the one
area where I noticed they are a little
less consistent is definitely their
eyeshadow palette I feel
there's a lot of hits there's a lot of
misses I was not a fan of the Urban
Decay Naked a formula I just felt like
they were a little hard to blend
I love the maps that they released a lot
of the maps in their palettes are
absolutely phenomenal but for some
reason some of their shimmers some of
their glitter in few shades and just
aren't as easy to work with in my
opinion now I really love that they play
with a lot of color they are definitely
a brand that excites me a whole lot but
the one area where I would say they are
the most consistent is for sure their
face and based products they have some
of the best foundations on the market in
my opinion I am absolutely in love
absolutely in love with the Urban Decay
Naked skin at foundation I do wear the
shade 0.5 it matches me perfectly it is
such a perfect foundation it just looks
gorgeous on the skin it's not heavy it
looks like skin but it still gives a
nice amount of coverage it's buildable
absolutely beautiful I love the Urban
Decay all nighter foundation one thing I
wish they would work on with their
foundations is a little more of a wider
a shaded selection the problem with the
Urban Decay all nighter foundation is
that it really does oxidize and darken
up on the skin again I do really shade a
0.5
it will probably you know blend and
match me a little better now that I'm
here and I have a little more of a tan
living here in Arizona but overall I
would say that their base products are
fantastic their foundations their Urban
Decay color correcting fluids I cannot
live without be pink or yellow one as
those are like Ryder territory for me
but you guys want me to do a video all
about like what I would take to a
deserted island it would be some you
know urban decay based products also
I've heard wonderful things about their
urban decay and naked skin concealer
still haven't tried that yet but it's
definitely on my list yet they really
excel with those kind of products and
then as far as their face products are
concerned they're really really good are
they as good as say a Becca cosmetics do
I love the blushes and highlights as
much as I love my shimmering skin
perfecter press or my luminous flushed
blushes from Becca no but I really do
enjoy what they have to offer it's still
good quality here I do have two of the
extras lo8 our powder highlighters
machine sin as well as aura or is a
really really nice cool tones pink color
as you guys can see and then sin is just
a typical sort of champagne color and
now these are definitely more of that
typical kind of powder highlight so they
don't really have like a foiled look to
them they're not like a big shoelace or
a product
are still really good and that their
blushes wear a very long time on the
cheek so yes I would have to say the
urban decay is definitely a consistent
brand as well alright next we're going
to talk about Benefit Cosmetics and
really know we have a lot to show for
Benefit Cosmetics I'm not that big of a
fan I actually find them to be very
unreliable and very inconsistent the one
thing I do enjoy from them is their
boxed product so now they have some box
bronzers they have some box of blushes
those are really really nice but I
noticed that when they put them into
pallets it's completely different like
the formula is just not there I have
picked up a product I'll go ahead and
insert a photo if I ten and there was
this palette called the real cheeky
party palette or something like that
I loved that palette for like the first
year that I had it had coralista in it
it had a benefit on Mikula some really
really nice based products in there but
then after about a year and a half those
products went to I mean they just
completely change the smell change
everything about them completely changed
and I feel like when they do put their
box products into palettes they're not
the same and I know that because I've
gone through two full sizes of coralista
I've gone through three full sizes of
benefits hoola I've gone through quite a
bit of those products now I will say I
love the fair real mascara I do have
quite a few full sizes of those would
not repurchase unfortunately benefit
does test on animals but overall benefit
it's just not one of those brands that
really really excites me a whole lot I
don't like their foundations haven't
been a huge fan of their concealers I
know a lot of people love array space
which today I actually woke up to a
video from Emily Noel 83 I guess that
they kind of redid that product but I
was never a fan of array space really
I've never been a fan of their base
product or their face products their
primers I'm really not a fan of their
brow products I mean I feel like they're
really really well known for their brow
products I've never liked them I feel
like they put a lot of money into
packaging and then for whatever reason
if like the product is just not that
good so if you are looking from anything
up from benefit I would highly recommend
I guess they're a cheek product so
definitely their bronzers and their
blushes let's get them in the full-size
I know they're a little more expensive
but I will say that the ones in the
full-size do last a long time they have
a beautiful color selection but yeah but
if it is kind of an inconsistent brand
of my opinion I feel like when they do
release products it's either a hit or a
miss and I really don't like when they
put their base products into palettes I
just feel like they're very inconsistent
and they
perform Alexa full-sizes alright guys
and finally we're going to go ahead and
talk about Stila Cosmetics unfortunately
I also find steal it to be a little bit
of an inconsistent brand or a little
unreliable lately they have been
releasing some really awesome products
and the ones that I'm talking about
specifically are these magnificent metal
glitter and glow liquid eyeshadows a lot
of people love these a lot of people
hate them I love them I have
about six or eight of them I want
literally the whole entire collection
Stila recently went cruelty free if you
guys didn't know which is awesome but I
really really enjoyed it but the thing
about sila is there's a kind of a brand
that bores me overall I feel like they
are very inconsistent with products so
when they release the product it's just
out of nowhere you know what I mean it
just comes out of nowhere and you never
know if it's going to be an eyeshadow
palette it was going to be a base
product and I understand that that's
like with any sort of brand but I feel
like they just don't really like their
releases don't really flow a certain way
like they'll release something like this
and then they'll release some sort of a
face part I don't know I don't know what
it is you guys it's just the way that
they release products is just kind of
weird to me now I will say some of their
palettes are good I really do enjoy it
they're perfectly perfect cute palettes
I own all four of those I am absolutely
a huge fan of those but I do find that
their blushes and their eyeshadows are a
little more firmly pressed they can be
very difficult to work with and you
never know what you're going to get all
apart of the perfectly perfect cute
palettes that I do own it personally all
have hits and misses in there some of
the shades are super foiled super super
beautiful and then some of them aren't
shocking some of them are firmly pressed
some of the blushes even in those
palettes just don't come off a certain
way on an actual skin and I actually do
have a palette here and I do have enough
shadows to fill up this whole entire
thing some of their single so I have a
one of their kitten singles and I used
to love that back in the day I still
have it like it was beautiful I use it
as a highlight that uses an eyeshadow
but unfortunately this formula just
hasn't really kept up with all of the
new age kind of space technology new age
makeup that has been releasing you know
a beige delayed product really really
soft boiled creamy shadows are very in
and I feel like feel I have kind of
stuck with what they always new which is
this and via particular shadows right
here which are the single you guys can
see they're very very pigmented I'm not
going to take that away from them but at
the same time they have a lot of fallout
tend to be very on the chunky side and
then when you try and blend them into
the actual skin they just kind of blend
away and I'm not a fan of that I feel
like they haven't really updated their
eyeshadow formula so that is definitely
one of the reasons why I find them a
little more unreliable and on top of
that I don't feel like they release
enough i shadow stuff I would like to
see them kind of update to their
eyeshadow formula and release more
eyeshadow palettes but it's really
really sparse you know what I mean like
their eyeshadow collection I feel like
we don't get a lot from them as far as
eyes are concerned definitely eyeliners
I've heard are fantastic I don't wear as
a steela you know liquid I stay all day
eyeliner because I can't do a winged
eyeliner for but I've heard
wonderful things about that but it's
just one thing that I notice about steel
is I find them a little on the boring
side and I don't want to say necessarily
that they're super super inconsistent or
completely unreliable but I just never
know what they're going to release and
usually when they're release product is
either completely a hitch or completely
a mess so anyway I hope you guys enjoyed
this a particular video thank you so
much for joining me let me know what you
think of these brands down below do you
think they're consistent do you think
they're unreliable do you think they're
just okay and do these brands for you
