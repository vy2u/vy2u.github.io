my channel today I having other
installments in my consistent versus
unreliable and makeup brand series now I
have not done at one of these in a while
I used to do them on a monthly basis and
then I basically just got away from all
of my monthly and weekly series now it's
not because they don't like any of them
I actually love all of them and I will
get back to all of them eventually but
there's just been a lot of reviews and a
lot of new products coming out so that's
kind of what has been taking up my time
but anyway yes today we have another
consistent versus unreliable makeup
brands we're going to be talking about
Becca cosmetics cover FX pretty vulgar
cosmetics as well as Smashbox so let's
go ahead and jump right into it I want
to start with Becca a book on this
absolutely no surprise if you've been
watching my channel for a while but I'm
going to go ahead and give them as the
consistent award
I feel like Becca face products are
really really out of this world they
make really great face pallets they have
excellent shimmering skin perfectors
which are basically just like a
highlighter that are kind of glowy and
very very pearly on the skin they are a
true powder formula this one right here
is called moonstone but they have a nice
arrangement of different shades to
choose from for all sorts of different
complexions they also have limited
edition ones you can pick up and then
they also have their light chaser
highlighters which are now permanent
these are kind of like dual chromatic or
shifting highlighters very very
beautiful color selection for those as
well big big fan of the luminous flush
of blushes as well as the mineral
blushes these are incredibly pigmented
and again the color selection is just so
diverse and very very special I don't
really have a lot of blushes in my
collections and I feel like can mimic
and Becca blushes this shade right here
is called Snapdragon it's one of the
luminous blush blushes it just gives the
most gorgeous glow to the cheeks and as
you guys can see it's like a hot coral
shade so really really enjoy a Becca
face products also I really do enjoy
their sunlit bronzers I still prefer my
more more butter bronzers over these
sunlit bronzers that these are also
pretty darn fantastic now they do have a
lot of primers they have three currently
I'm not the biggest fan of their primers
overall I would give them like a Q out
of 5 star rating just because this one
right here which is the first light
priming filter does not work for at my
skin type currently it just it will help
to prolong the wear of my foundation but
it doesn't give any sort of hydration or
anything like that and I really need a
lot of hydration right now so
is great if you are more crumbly and
then the backlight priming filter is
supposed to be great for those of you
with normal to dry skin but I think this
looks so artificial on the skin you guys
can see I have done some project pans
stuff with this I have tried to get
through it a bajillion times and these
take forever to get through so if you
really want any primer that's going to
last you a long time go ahead and pick
up one of the backup primers but overall
as the brand like as a whole I would say
they are pretty darn consistent I think
the thing that they really need to work
on is their eyeshadow formulas the
couple of eyeshadows that I have tried
from Becca I haven't been super super
impressed with I tried in the Jaclyn
hill champagne collection eye palette
and that one was just kind of a mess in
my opinion I ended up decluttering it I
love the face palette but I also didn't
like the little slim lights they came
out with but I did enjoy the Becca split
pan so again it kind of comes down to
they're very good with their face
products not so much with their eye
products I don't know if that could even
have some mascara
I believe they probably do but I never
hear anything about Becca mascara or
really eyeliner or anything like that I
feel like the main source that people go
to when it comes to Becca is their
shimmering skin perfectors you can get
them in liquid form you can get them in
pressed for import form they're really
really fantastic and I just feel like as
a whole a Becca really is a consistent
brand all right up next we have pretty
evolved our cosmetics now pretty vulgar
cosmetics was definitely a brand that
really took off like high shine eye
impact and they had their 5 minutes of
fame I did a video all about like brands
they had their 5 minutes of fame and
this was one of them I'll go ahead and
throw that video up in the cards if you
would like to check it out but pretty
vulgar was super super hyped up they
have beautiful beautiful packaging and
that really mimics like birds and stuff
like that very very gorgeous gorgeous
packaging even if it's like plastic and
kind of cheap just the way that they put
their products together I can see why a
lot of people are drawn to this I think
a lot of people looked at their products
and saw their packaging and thought of
like old-school two-faced products with
all of the flowers and the birds and
which is so beautiful and spectacular
and people were really really hyped up
however I would say that they are an
unreliable brand 75% of their collection
is just not worth the price in my
opinion
I think what they need to do is go ahead
and invest their time into their actual
formulations on their products instead
of into the packaging and I'm a huge a
sucker for great packaging but I have to
say I just feel like overall there's
only a few products that are really hits
and then like I said 75% of them are
kind of misses so I tried out these
setting spray I still have that I kept
the bottles just because I loved with
the bottle again the packaging is
beautiful but we're 35 dollars
definitely not I have the shimmering
Swan highlight which is really gorgeous
if you are super super fair complected
this will be too dark for you when I
first purchased it it was a little too
dark for me but now it does match me
nicely
it's very blinding it has like a nice
silvery kind of pinky shift to it it
wears a nice amount like throughout the
day but I definitely prefer other
highlighters over this and I didn't
really like that they only released a
one shade of this and it looks like even
now six months later they only still
have one shade of this now the pretty
vulgar the feathers mascara is actually
a mascara I'm going to talk about in an
upcoming video I hated that mascara at
first it was really really gloopy and
gross and I wasn't a fan of the wand or
the scent I'm still not a fan of the
wand or the scent but I have to say the
more that that has sit it sat in my
collection for like the past like four
to six months which is a very long time
for a mascara you probably shouldn't do
that but there are certain mascara
formulations that I let dry out on
purpose I now really do enjoy that
mascara has definitely been like a top
like mascara of choice for me personally
within the past couple of weeks but it's
such a hassle that you know you have to
actually like leave it open for a couple
of months before you can really dig into
it because the formula out of the tube
is very very gallupi and very very wet
and not like Urban Decay perversion wet
where it's kind of like silicone base
this is like sticky and it like plumps
your lashes together and give some light
of the look of like three lashes which I
love clumpy lashes but I don't want it
to look like I only have three lashes so
I feel like that's kind of a hit and a
mess and then as far as their eyeshadow
palettes are concerned just like the
shimmering Swan highlight I feel like
that use or those are one of the good
products from the line
I have swatch out all three palettes and
I thought they were really really nice I
personally absolutely love the
nightingale palette because the color
selection speaks to me are there better
formulas on the market absolutely but
I've never
palate that just has those really really
smoky tones in it besides like the
boudoir eyes or something from two-face
so overall I would give pretty vulgar a
unreliable sort of rating I feel like
because they are pretty new I don't want
to be too hard on them but I haven't
seen like any news about them lately
they don't post a lot on their Instagram
I've been wondering if they're gonna
come up with more shades of like their
best-selling products and it seems like
they haven't yet so I'm guessing that
they're gonna be booted off the Sephora
website at some point just because
there's so many other brands like
colour-pop that are coming in and
they're gonna swoop up all of the
attraction you know what I mean so yeah
I would say that a pretty bugger is
definitely an unreliable makeup brand up
next we have a cover FX now I feel like
hover effects doesn't really have a huge
range of products so in general I feel
like there's maybe what 15 to 20
products in the collection altogether or
at least the ones listed on the Sephora
calm website but the products that I
have tried from cover FX I have been
quite impressed with the only products
that I wasn't too keen on were again at
their face primers I'm pretty darn picky
when it comes to primers they're
mattifying primer as well as their
calming primer just didn't feel like
anything special they just kind of felt
like a drugstore primer again you can go
ahead and get drugstore primers that
literally will mimic high-end primers
nowadays I just feel like everybody has
forgotten what a primer is supposed to
do is supposed to prolong the wear of
your foundation and nowadays it seems
like brands are either really really
focusing on hydrating or blurring
primers I would like something that
really gives me hydration but also
prolongs aware of my makeup and the
cover FX primers did not do that for me
now they do have it the custom enhancer
drops I have not tried those but they
have like a 4.5 star rating on these two
4.com website and I just feel like
across the board they're pretty darn
consistent you don't see a lot of like 2
star 3 star rated products on the
sephora.com website as far as cover FX
is concern now one of my all-time
favorite holiday palettes for 2017 is
from cover FX I am incredibly in love it
would be perfect a highlighting palette
it's just absolutely beautiful you get
six different shades in here for holiday
2017 it retails for at $39 beautiful
beautiful packaging really loved the
formula on these highlighters even
though they are a true powder for
I'm kind of into like the facial a thing
these sort of remind me a little bit of
the Becca highlighters except they're
not as I guess powdery you know how when
you go into a becca highlighter you get
like a lot of kick back or kick up with
these you definitely don't but i love
the color selection i like that they
have a wide range of shades to choose
from when it comes to the cover FX
perfect blotting drops not
blotting drops what are they called the
custom enhancer drops but also they do
have like a blogging drop sort of
formula which is basically like a little
it's kind of like a serum or in essence
or like an oil that you drop into your
foundation and it supposed to keep you
matte throughout the day I did try that
out as a deluxe sized sample and I
actually really did work nowadays
obviously I don't need that because I'm
really not oily but overall I would say
cover FX really is the consistent brand
across the board I would like to see
them expand their collection I don't
have too much to say about them just
because you know they're really really
known for a few things like the custom
enhancer drops as well as the foundation
drops but you know those gets such a
high rating and this little highlighting
palette here really really impressed me
as well as like their cover effects
perfect you know setting powder stuff
like that so everything that I've tried
from them has either been a four star
rated product or a five star rated
product in my opinion and on the
sephora.com website so yeah I'm gonna go
ahead and say the cover FX is definitely
a consistent brand alright and lastly we
do have Smashbox Smashbox is kind of one
of those brands that I'm very
it's like inconsistent you know what I
mean it's not even unreliable or
consistent it's just inconsistent I
don't want I want to give them their own
turn because I either love their
products or I absolutely hate their
products they have some fantastic
foundations I love at the BP water drops
they have amazing primers they are like
the king or queen of primers okay I love
the photo finish foundation primer which
is just the original version they have
so many different color correcting ones
and they have bronze ones and they have
pore filling ones they have a primer for
you okay if you go to Sephora you will
find a primary from Smashbox and they're
really really good in my opinion they
were the first ones to kind of bring
primers onto the market alright and then
I also really really do enjoy their
photo finish primer water this is one of
my favorite setting sprays ever and I'm
pretty picky when it comes to that
right so I feel like that does say a lot
a lot of people were asking me do I like
this one or the Too Faced hangover RX
three and one replenishing face primer
or more I personally like this one they
both are silicone free alcohol-free and
oil-free but this one doesn't have any
added fragrance to it so if you are more
sensitive skin I would go with this one
and I just feel like this prolongs aware
of my makeup throughout the day
absolutely 100% and the thing about them
is like I feel like the primers the
foundations you know the face products
are all in like the three to four star
range but then we get to the very
inconsistent stuff which is kind of like
their eye products not so much their
mascaras an eye liner says I love their
always sharp liners and I really do like
it they're x-rated mascara it's kind of
personal preference that's a very lumpy
and clumpy kind of mascara but I have to
say I mean what's going on with their
eyeshadows I have never ever been a fan
of Smashbox palette Smashbox eyeshadow
palettes and I recently showed on my
wish list is that I wanted to go ahead
and pick up and be set right now that
has two of the cover shot palettes and
one of the highlighting palettes in em
from Sephora for the vib sale and I am
so torn because it's a great price but
at the same time I'm like I have never
ever ever liked Smashbox shadows okay
they're hard to blend they're very
crispy to the touch I don't know if they
have updated their formula but recently
they also released some new products and
they look so basic and so boring and
their eyeshadow palettes never ever ever
ever get me excited I don't think I even
have one like Smashbox eyeshadow palette
in my collection currently they have all
been too cluttered so I have to say that
they're just kind of like in their own
little guru but maybe a little bit
consistent and a little bit unreliable
but like I said I think their base
products are absolutely fantastic if
you're gonna go ahead and purchase
something from Smashbox get one of their
primers or their primer water or like
their foundations but yeah I don't know
I just feel like when a brand is really
really lacking or slacking when it comes
to eyeshadow palettes which is such a
huge thing in the makeup world right now
it kind of makes me go hmm like why is
that why is that
so anyway guys that is it for this
today's the video I hope you enjoyed it
thank you so much for joining me let me
know down below if you think these
brands are consistent or unreliable and
I will see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
