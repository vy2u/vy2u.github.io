channel today's video is going to be a
consistent versus unreliable makeup
brands video I'm so excited I have not
filmed one of these in a hot-ass minute
okay we're gonna be talking about bite
Beauty we're gonna be talking about Marc
Jacobs we're gonna be talking about
senti as well as a violet boss those are
the four different bands that we are
going to discuss in this video in these
videos I just like to let you guys know
how I feel overall about certain brands
and I know Fendi is a very very hot
topic right now and I recently picked up
one of their new wear products which is
their body lava so I'm also gonna give
you guys a little bit of a mini review
in this video but anyway I just wanted
to say really quickly if you do follow
me on Instagram I will be doing this
shot my stash over there today yesterday
I was stuck at the vet for 12 hours with
Khaleesi she actually has a massive
hairball launched in her intestines now
she may have to get surgery as she
cannot pass it in the next 48 hours they
did give me a laxative to give to her
but thank you for all the well wishes
that's why I wasn't able to upload
yesterday when my babies are not feeling
good I'm not feeling good I'm totally
gonna be one of those moms is just like
obsessed with how their children are
doing because that's the way I'm with my
ferret that is why I did not upload
yesterday but anyway let's go ahead and
just jump right into the video shall we
let's go ahead and start with a very
very consistent brand in my opinion and
that is 20 beauty the only product I've
tried from them that I haven't really
loved is actually the body lava this to
me is just a little too glittery it also
has a very very unique sort of texture
to it if you are someone who does not
like the sticky or oily a residue sort
of feeling on your body you're going to
hate this now that's not necessarily
what I hate about it what I really
dislike about this is actually the
fragrance while it smells really really
good I am somebody who does experience
body breakouts I get a lot of pimples on
my neck on my back and on my chest and
this has really really made my body
break out even more and I've only had it
for a few days so this is definitely a
product I'm going to reserve for using
on my legs it's not something I would
repurchase but the reason why I'm still
going ahead and giving Fenty beauty and
the overall consistent award is because
a lot of their products are very very
good quality I tried out two of their
Mademoiselle lipsticks I also recently
have tried out the Colossus balm and on
top of that
finally found the effective foundation
that's been hiding in my collection and
even with my extremely extremely sad dry
skin I have to say that foundation
glides on beautifully I also have the
matching primer which I enjoy there are
just a lot of things about 20 Beauty
where the majority of their products
really stand out as being strong to me I
know there are a lot of different people
with different complexions as well as
different skin tones who really do enjoy
fenty and I think that they really have
opened up this whole different realm of
being inclusive and I think it's
absolutely fabulous so I would say
overall fendi is definitely definitely a
consistent brand to talk about bite
Beauty you guys the king or queen of lip
products beautifully orgeous color
selections everything up from really
really unusual colors to a beautiful
bright reds and muted berries everyday
work friendly colors like honeycomb
right here which is my all-time favorite
nude I love the a mousse Busha formula
which is in the bullet form like this
and then I do enjoy also be liquefied
lips I recently did try out one of their
multi sticks and I was very very
surprised that I also enjoyed that I had
a feeling the multi stick would be a
little heavy on my skin but I can wear
it on my cheeks and that's saying a lot
because I don't like cream products on
my cheeks so I can wear that on my lips
I can wear that on my eyes as well as my
cheeks a lot of their products are
really really natural they do have these
wax in them so if you are vegan this is
not going to be a brand for you but I
would say yes if you are looking into
buy beauty and you're looking and seeing
the twenty six twenty eight dollar price
tag and thinking what the honestly
go ahead and try at least one of their
products incredibly moisturizing
incredibly beautiful on the lips a very
very pigmented great color selection or
I also really enjoy their lip scrub they
have a sweet cherry lip scrub as well as
a regular lip scrub and they also have
one of my all-time favorite overnight
lip mask which is the agave lip
treatment which is absolutely fantastic
I put that on it before I go and do a
show the next day so absolutely would
give up by beauty 10 out of 10 stars or
five out of five stars you guys know I'm
crazy about the brand and I would say
they are for sure consistent let's move
on to a brand that I never thought I
would enjoy as much as I do and that is
Marc Jacobs Marc Jacobs beauty is a
cruelty free a brand unfortunately their
fragrances are not to just you guys know
but yeah I love their lip products
especially their gold off says I am so
incredibly impressed with this little
snake charmer said
and then I picked up during the holiday
season I have never enjoyed a lip gloss
as much as I have enjoyed these lip
glosses they have a couple shades that
are definitely bestsellers like sugar
sugar sugar sugar looks a little
actually on my skin it looks like kind
of like I'm dead it makes me look like a
zombie so this isn't necessarily my
favorite shade if you are very fair
complected I even have self-tanner on
today and I still feel pretty damn pale
I will say skin deep is probably
something that is going to be a better
match for you it gives a little
pigmentation to the lips a little bit of
a depth to the lips and it is very cool
tone so if you're into that kind of cool
tone topi lip you're gonna love that
shade they also have really really bold
colors like this one right here which is
called a boys don't cry and they are so
glossy they are so pigmented and they
don't get stuck in hair on my teeth or
anything like that I don't find that
they transfer horribly throughout the
day so this is definitely a gloss
formula that I would recommend you guys
check out some more products from Marc
Jacobs that have really really surprised
me even though the price tag is quite
high are their foundations I know their
newest shameless foundation isn't that
great or at least that's what I've heard
but I loved loved loved they are a
genius shell foundation which is no
longer sold I also have heard that the
Marc Jacobs remarkable foundation is
really good at just a little bit goes a
very long way but yeah this is
definitely kind of a brand that I never
thought I would really get into just
because of the high price point I
recently have gotten more into luxury a
cruelty-free brands like hourglass and
things like that and I do feel as though
Marc Jacobs has some really nice quality
products so I would overall give them as
the consistent award they also have some
beautiful bronzers they have some
gorgeous blushes like you like their
blushes and I have a nudie shade as well
as kind of like an orange e peachy shade
they go on beautifully very very nice
thin consistency but you can really
build it up if you need to and finally
one of my all-time favorite mascaras is
the Marc Jacobs velvet noir I recommend
this to so many different people it is
fabulous it has sort of it a shape a
wand as say the Too Faced better than
sex but this is definitely more of a wet
formula it's not like Urban Decay
perversion where it's gonna transfer all
over the day but it's also not super dry
like better than sex so it's going to
fall and flake off throughout the day
onto your cheekbones it's just a great
formula really really good product I
love one coat of this even two coats
paired together with a dip
mascara and yeah every single product
that I've tried from Marc Jacobs I've
been incredibly impressed with the only
thing I have not really delved into yet
is their eyes shadows they don't release
too many eye shadow palettes they have
one that comes out during the holiday
season which is 99 dollars
which is a lot of money they also do
have a little tiny I think it's like six
or seven shadows or maybe quints that
they come out with and those have never
really gotten me super super excited a
lot of the shades seemed a pretty
neutral and pretty basic so I wouldn't
say I've gotten into their eyeshadows at
all but I will say their other products
do impress me and I'm gonna go ahead and
say they're consistent alright and
finally let's talk about by Lovaas i'm
going to be putting them into the
unreliable category because i find that
they do one particular thing very very
well and the other things not so well i
would say their glitters their false
eyelashes things like that or subpar i
have tried quite a few products out as
well as highlighting palettes from them
and when it comes to their eyeshadow
palettes these are the standout in the
collection so if you want a good
eyeshadow palette definitely go ahead
and jump on one of these if you're into
very foiled shades and these have a
great - glitter as well as foil finish
yes you heard me say that right they
have a good glitter finish I have never
ever liked a glitter eyeshadows but
these kind of presses the litter
pigments in here are really really
outstanding now these are definitely a
little stinky they're kind of cheaper
made on eyeshadows but in my opinion
they work really well for me I know some
people have compared these to morphe ice
shadows I had horrible reactions with
morphe eyeshadows I've never had
anything but good luck and good looks so
when it comes to a viola bas eyes
shadows now the only problem is they
keep coming up with these eye shadow
palettes now and it's almost like
they're out of color combinations I do
have I think four or five of their
different eyeshadow palettes and like I
said I feel as if I get very very
similar looks with a lot of them the
Holy Grail is quite similar to Laura Lee
if you line up some of like the warmer
tone shades over here the drenched metal
has a lot of similar shades to the
ride-or-die
and a lot of them do overlap so I would
give them the unreliable abord it's not
that they're a bad brand like I said
their eyes shadow palettes are good in
my opinion but the rest of their
products are just apart and very very
highly priced so I hope you guys enjoy
that this consistent versus unreliable
makeup brands video it's good to bring
this series of back thanks so much for
joining me and I'll see you guys in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
