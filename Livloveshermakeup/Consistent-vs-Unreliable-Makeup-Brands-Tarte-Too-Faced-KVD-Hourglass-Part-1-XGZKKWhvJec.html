today's video is going to be part one in
my consistent versus unreliable makeup
brands series yes I'm going to make this
into a series I just tried sitting down
and filming all the brands that I wanted
to talk about and it was getting past
the 35 minute mark which I do think it's
a little too long for a video I just
felt like I was just talking and talking
and talking and talking I think they
make several of these little videos I
can get my point across quicker and I'm
not just like sitting there and starting
to rant and things like that so anyway
you guys have been expecting this video
I talked about in my 2016 shittiest
makeup video I talked about how I wanted
to do this and talked a little bit about
some brands that I really think need to
be a little more consistent and that are
quite unreliable honestly and then I
also talked about some brands that I
think are really reliable most of the
time have really really good products
and our justice solid brand in general
so today we're going to be talking about
hourglass Kat Von D to face and tarts
those were kind of the two big ones that
I wanted to talk about we're going to
start with the good stuff so let's go
ahead and start with Kat Von D I feel
like Kat Von D is a very very consistent
brand I feel like I always always seem
to enjoy her eyeshadow palette I do have
three of her Kat Von D locket
foundations in different shades that is
quite a good foundation the only thing
that I feel like I've ever picked up
from president truly in love with is the
locket setting powder in the shade
translucent funny enough I do have this
on today I have found that I can get it
to work if I'm using a very lightweight
face product or for the most person is
the only thing this in probably should
be shade + light palette
and I can think of that really really
disappointed me if the shade stop light
palette I found was very very chalky
ended up going ahead and decluttering
that and this one I paired together was
like a full coverage foundation I find
that it makes me look very very kinky on
my face but for the most part I feel
like Kat Von D is a very solid and
consistent brand most of her products
are vegan she is cruelty free I really
like what she stands by what her brand
represents and she's really into giving
uh you know funds Elsa to like animal
shelters and just animal things in
general she's a good person overall and
I do like her brand so I do feel like
she's very consistent one of my favorite
things that I've ever picked up from her
is he metal math palette this was the
fantastic
definitely hands-down the best eye
shadow pellet that released this holiday
season I really really enjoyed that she
does not get all cheap when it comes to
Holiday Palace now this was just amazing
amazing quality you have her nice one of
the metal crush eyeshadows on the top
which feel identical to the singles I
have two of the singles and then you
have some mats on the bottom that are
just absolutely beautiful I feel like
she has really stepped up her actual
formulation when it comes to her masks
like I said the only thing I didn't like
was the shade + light palette as far as
eyeshadows are concerned I felt like
those were really chalky I feel like
when a brand really does make a
difference and they really do try and
step up their game as far as different
formulas are concerned I really
appreciate that so she does go and she
repackages her products she steps them
up she recently changed up the setting
spray this particular powder the
concealer which is amazing now the
concealer Lockette concealer is amazing
I have the shade whiteout it used to be
this one that came in a squeezy tube I
didn't think it was that great I really
appreciate when a brand can just
consistently step up their game so I
really do feel like Kat Von D is a very
consistent brand another really
consistent brand is hourglass although
they are very very pricy you are paying
for that luxury because you know what
everything is good their holiday
palettes are good they're the same exact
quality as like the singles that you
would get you guys know I'm obsessed
with the ambient strobe lighting powders
also hourglass easy cruelty free brand
they are not even owned by a company
that they don't test on animals they are
100% cruelty free I believe they are
working on coming out with some vegan
products as well really like what they
stand for and I just I love these
powders you guys they are so beautiful
their blushes are gorgeous their powers
are gorgeous and I feel like their
holiday palettes as well even though
they are very pricey they are very very
consistent and what you are getting in
here is what you are getting in the
singles now yes these are like $80 I'm
using what they need to work on is shade
selection instead of just releasing one
$80 palette every single year what they
could do is release a few different
versions of one palette so maybe one
that will cater more towards deeper skin
tones one that will cater towards light
skin tones like this one and then also
medium complexions I feel like they can
do that people will buy it for the price
because for the $80 this is worth it in
my opinion
a lot of people say oh you don't get a
lot of products in there but you know
what these are identical to what you are
getting in full-size so overall I think
hourglass is an extremely extremely
consistent brand as well now let's go
ahead and talk a little bit about
unreliable makeup brands the first one I
want to talk about is Tarte cosmetics
I've so many products from Tarte
cosmetics that I love I love their main
source of DC aqua sealer I wasn't a huge
fan of their foundation I did pick up
when his first release I picked it up
and I noticed that it was just very very
dark on my skin I know that they do have
a new shade selection which i think is
great but I'm just a little weary from
about purchasing from them now if that
makes sense I just feel like a lot of
their products are shitty and then some
of them are really really good they
claim to be all about made in America
and then they go and they make it these
holiday palettes that are just really
kind of crappy terms a great option
right there that I want to talk about
this is the beige blush book too so this
was like $60 you felt like you were
getting all these amazing amazing
full-size blushes in here this is not
the Amazonian clay blush formula and I
don't know if you're just thinking that
we don't know what the actual singles
are like or that we won't notice that
these are extremely powdery they don't
last on the skin all day I've noticed
that I do kind of like them as
eyeshadows so I'm going to keep it in my
collection but I hate when they release
something so beautiful you know like
they're not a used collection was
amazing those singles absolutely
beautiful they have some impeccable
impeccable products but then they go and
make something like this and I'm
thinking you know you put this together
in China first of all they always say
overbid in America we don't just on
animals put together in China it
probably cost them $10 to make this
particular palette and again they just
go and they give you on the quality you
know it's just not good quality and I
don't know if they think that we're not
going to realize but people who are big
avid makeup collectors notice these kind
of things you notice the difference
between the Amazonian clay blush
palettes that are made in the US and
this you notice the difference between
the blush singles and this and it's just
really really unfortunate that they go
around and they do that I believe the
big blush book the first edition was
even cheaper than this one which is kind
of again you know they just know people
are going to buy it so they go ahead and
do that and you know they really really
get you in they do these big tripping
with tour trips or whatever and all of
these youtubers go and they promote
their products over and over and over
again and
don't even get me started on this trip
it was charting if you guys would like a
little rap video on that I can talk
about that as well but I just feel like
you know it's like they're brainwashing
us by saying oh my god you're getting so
much good stuff in here
all the limited edition stuff is so
great and then first of all it's not
limited edition limited edition my app
which I'm going to be doing a video
called limited edition my ass products
that are still available for multiple
different brands and then on top of that
they tell you you know it's such great
quality when it's not made in America it
could have been possibly tested on
animals when they claim to be
cruelty-free brand they are owned by
different companies that test on animals
I just feel like they're all over the
place and it really makes me nervous to
purchase from them I never know if I'm
going to get something completely shitty
or something really really good quality
so part is definitely one of those
inconsistent brands in my opinion and I
have to talk about to face to face is my
all-time favorite brand I know that they
just recently sold to Estee Lauder and a
lot of people are disappointed because
they're a cruelty-free brand but now
Estee Lauder owns and Estee Lauder does
huge amounts of animal testing I believe
the absent one L'Oreal the reason why I
bring up animal testing all the time is
because a lot of you have been asking me
to bring up you know it's a brand test
on animals or not so I believe that
Estee Lauder also owns L'Oreal they do
some of the worst animal testing in the
business I'm not going to leave any
videos down below but you can do your
own research please do it at your own
risk because these are some really
disgusting things that they do to these
animals but anyway here is a great
example of something that just wasn't up
to quality this is the Christmas in New
York - chocolate shop cocoa powder
infused collection this was the first
holiday palette I picked up and I feel
like I was brainwashed I said you know
what you guys is pretty damn good you
know what no it's not good good my ass
this should have been at the quality of
the chocolate bar palette if they want
to sell this for almost $70 with like a
few little minis in there and whatnot
the minis were exactly what you get in
full-size but like the actual eyeshadow
palette I'm thinking you know what this
should be this should be what the
chocolate bar palettes are they make
some amazing amazing products like I
said they are some of my favorite brand
like I love to face okay I love to face
and for them to go and cheaply make this
and just put it together and you know go
and do the same thing over and over and
over again I'm thinking like okay yep
with your color selection you're very
consistent but give me something
different all they ever do is put in a
blue and up
Bohlander like Oh we'll call it a day it
looks exactly like the nikkietutorials
palette I feel like I was brainwashed
when I review this I said oh it's pretty
good quality you're getting a lot in
here you know what Pam size is not that
great in here color selection is not
that great and these should be the
quality that the chocolate bar palettes
are that is what they sell so well and
again I just feel like even with like
the matte Shoplet chip tell us a little
mini one that came out it was completely
different from the chocolate bar palette
I'm Feud I did really like the white
chocolate bar palette the little mini
one or the chocolate chip palette I'm
sorry but I just don't understand how
can they be all over the place if you
know that your customers love something
they love the chocolate bar pellets they
love the sweet peach palette why not
make it consistent again with the sweet
peach collection that was a map
you know ordering all that stuff people
waiting in line doing all this kind of
stuff not to say that you know they
didn't do their best I think they did
their best and when they released
everything again and they made
everything permanent it was a lot better
but sitting there for you know 45
minutes in line waiting to get onto the
toothpaste website
it's you know three o'clock a.m.
on the East Coast people are waiting up
for their sweet peach palette I mean I
feel like things could be done a little
better you know released it in the
afternoon you know where people can at
least go online and they can wait while
they're working or something and have
the screen open I just the whole thing
the whole thing about these limited
edition products especially the ones
that are so hard to get limited-edition
my app it really really is just sad you
know speaking of the Tarte rainforest of
the sea this was supposed to be limited
edition and no longer is listed as
limited edition on the sephora.com
website what else let's see here's a
chart rainforest of the sea volume one
eye shadow palette has been
limited-edition for 12 months now like
why do you just say it's not limited
edition they're really just trying to
pull you guys in and say hey you need
this you need this you need this I will
say the chart rainforest of the sea eyes
shadow palettes are very very good
quality but this other stuff is they're
making overseas really quickly you know
charging you an arm and a leg for is
just not good quality so I would highly
recommend staying away from two faiths
as far as their holiday collection is
concerned and definitely Tarte as well
it was big like shadow boxes that they
put together so chalky so horrible I
never purchased their eyeshadow palettes
when they are one of their holiday
releases and I know it's
like I'm really running on their ass
right now and a lot of people are going
to call me a bitch I really don't give a
 they need to work on becoming more
consistent they have great quality
products that are made here in America
that are not tested on animals just do
the same thing over and over instead of
trying to brainwash us and getting all
these influencers to go to Bora Bora and
talk about how great this is how great
that is
and then we buy it if we're like what's
going on here so anyway that is it going
around it a little bit but that is what
this series is going to be about if you
don't like it that's fine if you want to
leave me a rude comment down below
that's fine as well I really
don't give a flying this is what I
want to say about this brand I feel like
we all have been fighting our time when
it comes to to face like limited-edition
stuff and out so tarts they need to step
their game up they're some of the best
in the business they need to be a lot
more consistent they need to be coming
out with stuff that is consistent like
Kat Von D and also hourglass even if
they're going to charge a little more it
would be better if it was made in the US
if we knew that it wasn't tested on
animals and if we knew that it was
actually good quality you know I mean so
anyway that gives me first a little
chapter in this series I hope you guys
enjoyed it this video I think next I
will talk about drugstore brands heyo
that's pretty much it thanks for joining
you guys see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
