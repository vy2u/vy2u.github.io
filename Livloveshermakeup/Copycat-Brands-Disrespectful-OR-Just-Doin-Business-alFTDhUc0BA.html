channel I keep looking at myself in the
mirror and I'm trying to figure out like
what's going on with these fake
eyelashes right and I just realized I
think I put this one on backwards
literally my life anyway today this
video is going to be about copycat brand
so I want to start this video by saying
I don't think that being a copycat is
necessarily always a bad thing in
certain scenarios through single style
obviously originates from somewhere and
whether we like to admit it or not we
are all taking inspiration from one
another and our surroundings for makeup
companies that can get a little tricky
when another brand comes at you it
basically takes all of the details of
your product that seems sort of
packaging layout color selection and
sells it for a fraction of the cost and
basically makes their own like Carbon
Copy if this is where the big debate
comes in our knockoff brands like bad
habit even color pop can be put into
this category because they've done some
knockoff sort of palettes and makeup
revolution you know are they actually
leaching off the success of these other
true artistic brands that put a lot of
time and effort into their releases in
my opinion absolutely yes do I think
it's going to change anything in the
beauty community absolutely not nor do I
think makeup revolution and those brands
right there even care makeup revolution
colour-pop bad habit beauty none of
those brands give me the vibes that they
put an immense amount of work and true
artistry into their palettes I'm not
saying that they don't have good
palettes I'm not saying that I don't
like the color selection of the palettes
I'm just saying you can look at a cap on
deep palette and you can look at a color
pop palette and you will see a huge
difference obviously cap on D is much
more expensive than color puffs but you
guys know where I'm going with this
what they really care about in my
opinion is getting their products out to
the masses for a fraction of the cost
because there are a lot of people out
there that don't want to spend 48
dollars $50 $60 on eyeshadow palettes
now I don't remember people talking
about makeup revolution in a negative
way I'm telefon D actually mentioned
there light plus shade palette was
pretty much a spot-on replica of her own
shapeless light palette and I mean yeah
I think everybody noticed that
immediately because that's the point of
some of these really really super
affordable cosmetics especially bad
habbit as well as makeup revolution and
they are trying to copy you but keep the
item low cost now the funny thing is
that we have made dupes a thing
ashlee youtube and beauty influencers we
have made dupes a thing and a lot of
people will say well why should I go out
and buy that $60 kat von d palette when
I can get something for eleven dollars
but if you are a beauty enthusiast you
can tell the difference and sometimes
you do notice the difference between the
max made palette for $11 and the $60
limited edition Kat Von D eyeshadow
palette now to be fair sometimes it's
the opposite there were a lot of people
that actually preferred the light blush
shade over Kat Von D shade + light
I actually tried both of them out I
didn't like either of them I did not
like Kat Von D's version I did not like
a makeup Revolutions version and again
that's just personal preference that's
just makeup preference now I have
noticed personally that makeup
revolution has started to kind of go in
like the base direction they always have
had baked highlighters baked blushes but
they have been releasing more of like
their own products recently but they
have a ton of new releases just like
color pop it just like that happen every
time that habit you know restocks the
 Athena palette it sells out in
five minutes and then they just restock
again so it's one of those things where
these brands have to they literally have
to follow every single trend that comes
up whether it be unicorns whether it be
unicorn rainbows whether it be
 rainbows unicorns they
have to follow the trend artistry it may
have ate a certain brand owner
whereas money may motivate a certain
brand owner and of course I'm sure
there's in-betweens as well but you
really can see it and especially like I
said if you're following these people on
social media I love following Kat Von D
on social media I love seeing her
pictures with her husband her life does
go into her work do you know the brand
owners in color pop the brother and
sister that really really laid low and
pretend like they don't own the company
do you know the brand owners of makeup
revolution do you care mass production
of cheap alternatives doesn't always
feel as special to me as the real deal
when you can see and even feel the
dedication that went into the release
that's what I'm trying to say my opinion
copycats are both disrespectful but
they're also business savvy this is
still the business world yes there's a
little bit of pettiness and shadiness
but these are beauty companies this is
what the industry is like if this
 sells and while some companies that
may find it a little bit of a nuisance
to have to compete with a lower range
kind of dupe for their pallet it's just
the way the industry work though I find
it quite distasteful to go and literally
steal someone's name off of a pallet as
well as these same exact shades I'm kind
of in the middle because I purchase from
makeup revolution I purchased from
colour-pop I've had products sent to me
for free from bad habits so it's not
like I'm gonna sit here and bash bash
bash and say oh I would never try that I
would never do that no dupes do interest
me I'm into Dukes like I said the beauty
community really got dupes to be a thing
okay we get excited when we think oh
it's gonna be the same colors the same
texture but for a lower cost who doesn't
want that but you know I think it's very
important that if you want to stand up
on this topic and you feel very strongly
about this always talk with your money
not your mouth that's what we say in the
cruelty free world because it is so
 true there's so many people that
run and say oh California I can't
believe they did this and make a
revolution how dare you I don't think
makeup revolution gives two shits go
ahead and take that hard-earned money
that you have and put it into Kat Von
D's products do not give your money to
these brands if you really really feel
against them so anyway I would love to
know what you guys think of copycat
brands down below do you find them
disrespectful do you find them business
savvy what do you think I would love to
know and I yeah that's pretty much it
guys I will see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
