this video I have a first impressions
review for you guys on the new covergirl
clean that BB cream for oily skin they
shade that I picked up is called 510
fair and they do have six different
shades on the Ulta calm website which is
where I purchased mine it was only eight
dollars and forty nine cents and the
claims on this are basically that it
will keep you matte all day it will hide
your blemishes and it's supposed to be
one of those foundations that can kind
of match to your skin tone which is kind
of weird because I feel like this shade
right here 5/10 Fair is quite dark so we
shall see how that goes but yeah I am
going to be going ahead and applying
half of this product with my Beauty
Blender sponge now my Real Techniques
complexion miracle complexion sponge on
one side this is damp and then on the
other side I will be applying with my
Sigma 3d HD kabuki brush and then I will
be setting it in with my Ecotools brush
and the essence all about matte 16
compact powder depending on if I feel
like I need to set it in and I do want
to let you guys know right off the bat I
already cleansed my face I used the Olli
Henriksen grease relief cleansing cloths
they look like this I used one of these
to run over my face and I don't like to
wear any sort of skin care or primers
when I do first impressions reviews
because this is just my first
impressions and I will be back in
exactly a week to give you guys my final
thoughts after I have tried them with
primers and things like that but just
for the first initial thoughts I do like
to try this without a primer I first so
anyway you do get one fluid ounce of
product in here which is the standard
amount for a foundation and let's go
ahead and I'm gonna shake this up
quickly I don't know why I do feel like
I shouldn't so I'm just going to put a
little bit on the back of my hands the
consistency looks like it's between like
a cream and a liquid so I'm going to
start with the Real Techniques sponge
side and we are just going to put this
right onto the base wow that actually is
a perfect beautiful color match and glad
that I self-tans last night because I
feel like this would not be matching me
so well if I hadn't alright so right
away I can tell that it definitely
doesn't have the coverage I thought it
would but it is drying down crazy Matt
and I am even using a damp sponge right
now which usually gives a little bit of
like a dewy finish but this is that
looks quite nice
alright I'm gonna apply a little more
seems quite buildable it does have a
strange scent kind of smells like
foundation that has gone bad nothing
this one has because the expiration date
is just fine on it I checked that last
night but has a little bit of a strange
scent does this have innocent BB cream
so I'm guessing it does have sunscreen
in it it doesn't say it has sunscreen
which is weird because if it's a BB
cream product I feel like it should have
sunscreen it says it's oil-free won't
clog pores suitable for sensitive skin
lasts all day guys I don't even think
this has SPF in it which is strange
because if it's a BB cream it
technically should but so far this is a
beautiful color match I did apply my
Jerkins um what is it natural glow
affair to light last night I use the
lotion version and I did apply that on
my face and on my body so I feel like
this is actually matching quite well
when I first got it I was kind of in the
middle of letting my self tanner kind of
fade off and I really thought I was
gonna be dark I did end up cheating and
putting it a little bit on the back of
my wrist and who was hella dark so I'm
glad that I softened and I will be doing
that consistently throughout the summer
probably so that won't be an issue but
yeah so very that looks pretty good that
is about two layers right there I feel
like it's a nice satiny look and I do
feel like it is drying down matte as we
look at it so yeah there is one side
that is not done and there is the other
let's go ahead and do the other side
with these Sigma brush so I'm just gonna
put a little on the back of my hand
we're just gonna apply this hmm
wow I feel like I'm getting a lot more
coverage with the brush which is
interesting because normally I feel like
I get more coverage with the sponge but
I can tell definitely and I think you
would get even more coverage if you just
took the product and would like put it
on your face and then blend it in I'm
gonna try that as well hmm it looks nice
with the brush I did not think I would
prefer it with the brush but I think I
kind of deal I like the way it went on
with the brush thanks
so I feel like this side it's definitely
there's a little bit of brush strokes
over here which is something I don't
like with brushes but I do like the way
that this kind of buffed it into my skin
I feel like over here it still looks
pretty but I think I'm getting better
coverage on this side with the Real
Techniques or I'm sorry the UM with the
Sigma brush which is interesting so I'm
gonna let that just sit there for a
second I look extremely matte right now
which is great like this is beautiful
I do have oily to combo skin so I think
this looks really nice I might not even
have to set this in with a powder but I
do want to go in with a whole another
layer on my face just because what the
hell we're gonna build it up I'm gonna
see if it builds for it nicely and
things like that so I'm gonna go ahead
and spot this on this time so I'm just
gonna put it on like that and then we
will go ahead and blend it in see if we
can get more coverage that way since
we're not sucking up all the product to
it the actual sponge or the applicator
something go back in Wow try super matte
I like that I like that a lot if you're
an oily beast like me I think you may
like this
I do wish they did have one shade that
was a little lighter than fair wow that
looks beautiful do you guys agree I
really like the way that looks right now
we are in natural lighting right now I
do have my shades rolled up a few of you
been asking if I would do that because
you let prefer the lighting like this
and I love the way this looks
doesn't beautiful I am blessed I am
impressed you guys this is amazing I
mean it's just drying out to this
beautiful beautiful finish oh yeah
that's a covergirl all right I'm gonna
do a little bar on the other side again
I'm going to put it on with my finger
and then blend it in with the brush on
that side I love the way that looks and
it seems like the coverage is definitely
getting up there when I first applied
the first layer I definitely thought
because the consistency of the product
was a little bit creamy
I thought for some reason that it was
going to just go on like medium to full
coverage but it looks like you do have
to build it however it feels beautifully
so I mean I should say it feels
beautifully for those who do probably
have combo oily of course I'll wear it
this week and
let you know if you would like this for
dry skin but from what I'm seeing right
away I'm gonna go ahead and say it's a
no Nell for dry skin because on my comp
Oh oily skin it is drying completely
matte and I almost feel like I don't
need to set it in which is crazy so I
feel like if you do have dry skin you
know this is gonna be too much for you
it's probably gonna over emphasize
things but I like the way it looks when
I really kind of buff it in there mmm
yes Wow very pretty very very pretty now
when I just started building up that
extra layer I do like I do prefer and
like the way it looks blemishes over
there I like the way it looks over here
more with the sponge but the first layer
I thought it looked better with the
brush so that is kind of interesting all
right guys so what do you think I like
the way that this goes on I think this
is pretty like really pretty it has
completely dried down to like a satiny
matte texture which i think is gorgeous
but I am still gonna go ahead and set it
in because I am an oily beast so we're
going to take the essence all about Matt
fixing compact powder with the Ecotools
this is the Tarte
err buffer foundation brush dupe it's
definitely not as soft but it has the
same sort of concept if you guys are
curious I am just setting everything in
focusing more on my t-zone where I do
start to get a little more oily whoa
look at that in the corner of my eye huh
really built up there
it looks nice when I do stipple the
powder on top it doesn't look super
cakey or anything like that I do just
want to make sure that I am left
completely matte throughout the day and
I do feel like this is gonna work I
really hope so
I will definitely obviously have a
follow-up haul for you guys um exactly a
week from today so hopefully next
Tuesday but so far so good this looks
beautiful on the skin love the coverage
I love the way it went on I think the
color match is good as long as I have
themselves panning I think the color
match is fine and even when I put the
powder on I don't feel like it looks
cakey at all or is patching up on
certain areas of my face so
yes so far so good guys I am very very
impressed as you can probably tell um
hmm yeah even around my nose area and
like around this area where I tend to
have larger pores I don't feel like it's
super visible or noticeable what do you
guys think I know that right here I'm
having some breakouts and most of them
are just acne scars but you know those
are still a little visible but I still
feel like it's decent coverage it feels
lightweight on the skin I don't feel
like I'm wearing a mask I like this so
far alright guys so that is my first
impressions on that new little covergirl
beat me matte I will be back in exactly
a week to give you guys my final
thoughts after I play around with it a
little more with different primers
different powders setting it with a
powder not setting it with a powder
things like that so I hope you guys
enjoyed this first impressions I'm very
excited now thank you so much for
joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
