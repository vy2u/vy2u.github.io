thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having a fantastic day as
always I am here to review and give you
guys swatches on a new covergirl
eyeshadow palette that I actually
purchased on the all TOCOM website for
$11.99 this is what it looks like it is
called the covergirl roses true naked
eyeshadow palette and it comes with
eight different shades you get a variety
of bat shimmer glitter shades and it
looks a very reminiscent of the Naked 3
palette it's got a lot of rosy tones in
there and I just thought he looked
really really beautiful and I was very
very excited to try it out since you
guys probably know if you've been
watching my channel for a while though I
did not like any of my naked palettes
and I did end up going ahead and letting
go of all of them but anyway this is
what it looks like I thought it was
really really beautiful there are two
other different shades that you can also
pick up there's one that has more
greenish tones in it like khaki colors
and then one that's called naked which
just has your basic kind of neutral
everyday sort of colors but this was the
one that I spoke to me the most I just
thought it looked really really
beautiful and I loved those rosy tones
in there so I was really really excited
to try it out and I'm very very happy to
let you guys know that I actually really
really enjoyed this little palette I
have never found that covergirl
eyeshadows have been that fantastic in
my opinion I always thought they were a
little crispy to the touch they just
didn't blend very well they weren't very
easy to use but I'm happy to say that
this palette is very very different they
actually have a really nice texture to
them very similar to the Becca
shimmering skin perfectors this one is
in moonstone but they have that sort of
same sort of texture maybe they're a
little crispier
feeling um but they have that same sort
of texture that's just kind of buttery
and a little um it's like it has like a
little bit of keep saying Chris Venus
but you know it's got a little bit of
texture to it but not too much I feel
like these shadows are very very similar
I'm gonna read to you guys quickly about
what it says on the allcom website so it
says the covergirl roses true naked eye
shadow palette right now they have are
having me buy one get one at 50% off so
if you are interested
getting this one and maybe the khaki one
or this one and the naked one you can go
ahead and get those so they are 1199 at
peace but you can get one for 50% off
right now on the Elton on websites
so it says cover girls roses true naked
eye shadow palette has a stunning range
of neutral shades for your perfect nude
eye look
richly pigmented shadows in Rose and a
range of colors of tech and textures
from neutrals to Smokies and shimmers to
max multiple highlighter base crease and
crease and liner shades it has eight
shadows to smooth wonderful application
and bridge payouts eight shades of a
universally flattering perfectly paired
and neutrals and dermatology
dermatologists are much logically tested
so really really good and I do want to
say also I have tried these wet and dry
and they get really really like boom
like out there if you want to you don't
pair them with something that is wet so
you can go and spray your brush with
like six plus or any kind of setting
spray and you will make these shadows
show up like way way more so I am
wearing it today I do have this color
right here in my crease I have at this
color right here on my lower lash line I
have this one on my lid and then this
one also on my lid I think the ones in
here that are really really nice are the
satiny kind of shimmery shades but Mac
also feels really really nice but I will
say the glittery shades have with a
little bit of a crispier texture to them
basically it does come with this little
dual and did a little brush right here
and I didn't do nothing core sponge tip
applicator I guess you can say I did not
think I was seen to get any use out of
this whatsoever but I didn't use this
side today and I actually really liked
it I used it with this color right here
and I went in on my lower lash line I
felt like it was very precise it was
easy to use and I may end up just
keeping this because I did think that it
went under there really really nicely
but overall I think these are really
fantastic definitely definitely wear a
primer with them because you will get
the most out of them if you wear a
primer they will last all day if you
have a primer however and I just find
that covergirl really kind of stuff
name up again it is $11.99 for this
palette which I mean let's be honest
drugstore prices drugstore everything
seems to be getting quite expensive
especially the makeup in general just
seems to be getting like point up there
in price which I'm not a huge fan of but
I do think that this is worth the 1199
especially if you can get one of them
right now for 50% off on the alta
dot-com website I think all of them have
a really really nice sort of it's not
like I would say that they feel like a
lorac shadow by any means but they do
have some sort of like a buttery texture
to them but there's a little bit of grip
there which actually can help let's hold
on to your eye better but I do think
they blend beautifully and I am really
really happy with them so this is again
what they look like and I'm gonna go
ahead and swatch them for you guys so
we're gonna start with the lightest
shade over here so this one they don't
have any names on them but this one is
kind of like a pearly matte light like
whitish pinky undertone color it looks
like that I'm just gonna go ahead and
swatch that on the back of my hand for
you guys that is the first shade as you
guys can see they are really really
blendable pigmented beautiful the second
shade is that kind of what would you
call that champagne II pinky undertone
sort of shade it's really really
beautiful and this one definitely has a
little more shimmer to it it's also
really really beautiful I have this on
my lid today I don't notice a huge
amount of fallout when I use these but I
do notice when I dip my brush and it
kicks up a lot of product so there is
that second shade right there and then
the third shade is a beautiful kind of
matched transition color it's basically
like an old kind of like a mob like a
light pinky mouth color and it's
beautiful there it is I feel like when I
go in there with my finger or my brush I
do get like product that falls out
everywhere but it's not like that on my
eyes it's interesting so there is that
third color right there and I just think
that these are so reminiscent of the
Naked 3 palette I did kind of compare
these to my revealed 2 palette from
Coastal Scents because I
we really like that one a lot and I did
feel like there were a lot of colors
that kind of overlapped but let me show
you guys really quickly do you guys see
what I mean can you see where that
product kind of kicked up down there so
when I dig my fingers in there even if
I'm just doing it lightly for swatches
there still is like a texture that comes
up but I don't seem to have that issue
when I'm using it on my eyes like with
my brush yes it will take out product
but then when I put it on my eyes it
just kind of blends out and I don't have
fallout so the next one is another one I
have on my lid today it's kind of a rose
gold shimmery color really really
beautiful go ahead and swatch that for
you guys there it is it's kind of got a
coppery sort of undertone really really
beautiful for the lid and then I have
this one which is the one that is on my
crease today and it's just a beautiful
kind of purply mauve color it's very
similar to the other one that's great
for transition except this one is just a
little deeper in tone it's got a little
more purple payoff right there and then
the next one is one of those kind of
glittery shades and it is right there
this is the one that I have on my lower
lash line today it's kind of like a
deeper brown color with lots and lots of
pink and purple shimmer in there and
again these ones feel a little more
textured and I don't feel like the
little pieces of glitter really come off
that well but still a really really
gorgeous color
you guys can see that and then the next
one is kind of similar again it's a
little more satiny than glittery but
it's this deep deep dark kind of smoky
shade and it's kind of like a grey Brown
a black color all mixed together maybe a
little bit of gunmetal as well so that
is that color right there
really really beautiful gorgeous color I
need to play with this one more there is
that color and then the final color is
that beautiful kind of glittery black
color with tons and tons of pinkish
shimmer and a red maybe reddish pinky
shimmer really really gorgeous so those
are the last two shades so as you guys
can see they are very very blendable
and like I think I just I'm surprised I
don't get as much fallout with them if
that makes sense because they just
thought because they are kind of soft
and a lot of softer than something I'm
used to working with from covergirl I
just thought that maybe they would have
some fallout on my eyes but they don't
they only do when I'm putting my fingers
in there or my brush I do get like kick
off like I said but overall I think
they're really pigmented very very
beautiful blendable and I think the
color selection is gorgeous of course
they're copying urban decay when it
comes to this sort of palettes like the
whole naked want to make it too naked
three sort of thing I think the most
like original one was probably like the
khaki one that has more green colors in
there but it was sold out on the El Topo
con website when I tried to purchase it
so this is the one I got I think it's
really really beautiful I hope that the
other two have the same sort of
formulation as this one does because I
would definitely be interested in
picking it up or those two up if it is
similar but overall I think it's really
really beautiful you get a nice
combination of maths shimmers glittery
shades lots of different finishes lots
of different colors and overall I think
it's very compact and easy to use
I would prefer obviously if they were a
mirror at the top but of course we are
talking drugstore and that's just not
usually something that they will do
because how else would you be able to
see the product really you know if it
was closed up and there was a mirror on
top so anyway I'm really really
impressed I'm really happy that I picked
this little eyeshadow palette up I think
it's wonderful I will link below where
you guys can pick it up if you would
like to and let me know if you've tried
any of them and what you guys think of
them I'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
