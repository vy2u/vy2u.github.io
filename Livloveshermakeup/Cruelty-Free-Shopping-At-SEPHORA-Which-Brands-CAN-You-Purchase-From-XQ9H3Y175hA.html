today's video is going to be all about
cruelty-free shopping at Sephora this is
a topic that is very near and dear to my
heart it has been about a year and a
half since I went cruelty-free and I'm
super excited to give you guys a
shopping guide on which brands you can
purchase from when it comes just a for
now about ten months ago I did a video
talking about brands that you can
purchase at Ulta that are cruelty free I
will go ahead and throw that video up in
the cards and I wanted to let you guys
know I will be reading from my little
list that I put together and I'm going
to pin that list down below it'll be the
top comment that you see if you scroll
down if you want to go ahead and
screenshot that or take it with you
shopping I think that would be fabulous
even if you're not cruelty free I think
it is worthwhile knowing the brands that
do not test on animals let's go ahead
and jump right into it guys I have
different little Miranda lifts here
we're gonna go ahead and start with
makeup then we will get into skincare
then haircare beauty tools and
miscellaneous alike I said if you want
this list it's gonna be pinned down
below we are starting with anasazi of
Beverly Hills a great brand in my
opinion one of my all-time favorite
brands currently now I love this brand
for their eyeshadow palette so I think
they have a great formula as far as
their eyeshadow palettes are concerned
even if they change them up a little bit
here and there I also really do enjoy
their highlighting palettes and just
their highlighting formulas in general
all of their glow kits even though they
may have a little bit of different
ingredients different things going on I
still think the majority of them are
fantastic I own almost all the glow kits
so I can tell you that with the fact
they also have some really great lip
products so Anasazi of Beverly Hills
you're good to go they are cruelty free
up next we have cover FX not only are
they cruelty free they are a 100% vegan
which I don't think a lot of people know
about which is awesome
Smashbox cosmetics has also made at this
list however I do think it's important
to mention to you guys when a parent
company does tests on animals so
Smashbox is owned by parent company that
does tests on animals however they
themselves do not also on this list we
have Marc Jacobs Beauty we have Stila
cosmetics as well as senti Beauty Urban
Decay is another brand that is cruelty
free however they do also have a parent
company that tests on animals please let
me know down below if you would like me
to do a video sharing my thoughts on
parent companies that do tests on
animals and how I feel about parent
companies in general I
to see a little more on the
glass-half-full sort of side I know some
people really do not even want to go
there if a parent company does tests on
animals they will not purchase from them
but that is not what I am like all right
let's move on to you axilla G this is
actually a cruelty-free as well as 100%
vegan brand and I believe they're more
into lip products this is not a brand
that I have tried myself and they are
rather new to Sephora this one and I
think it's an Sonam that has all those
baked blushes and baked powder
foundations I've heard they're really
really good a lot of them tend to be
more like green beauty as well which is
really cool but I personally have not
tried anything from them but they are
cruelty free some more cruelty free
brands on this list include a pretty
vulgar cosmetics and milk makeup as well
as it cosmetics now I believe it
cosmetics is still owned by a parent
company that does tests on animals I'm
gonna put a star next to this one on the
list down below because I'm not a
hundred percent sure of that I will do
some more research and I will update you
if I have any news on that we also have
sea otter London and bare minerals and
buxom cosmetics they are both owned by
the same parent company and that parent
company does also test on animals just
so you guys know but they themselves do
not josie maran is on this list as well
as of course - face now - face was
bought out by Estee Lauder and I believe
at 2015 so their parent company also
does tests on animals
Besame cosmetics is on this list for
Sally I'm putting in the makeup category
just because I feel like a lot of their
products are used in conjunction with
makeup
they are cruelty free as well as a
hundred percent vegan we also have one
of my favorite brands on this list and
Becca cosmetics just so you guys know
they are owned by parent company that
also does tests on animals our MS Beauty
is cruelty free as well as Kat Von D and
hourglass cosmetics now hourglass
cosmetics I believe is still also owned
by a parent company that does tests on
animals however they have plans to be
vegan by 2020
and their whole entire line which is
awesome wander Beauty is another one
that I have not personally tried from
Sephora but they are cruelty free as
well as tarte cosmetics you guys know
I'm not the biggest fan of tarte right
now but they are cruelty free however
they are owned by parent company that
does tests on animals as well by beauty
as the cruelty-free brands such a great
brand I love their lip products and then
finally we do have an to them so Antonin
is that
I was telling you about that kind of
came out with ecology and they are the
baked powder foundation baked blush sort
of brown I'm really interested in trying
out some of their products so that's why
I have listed as makeup if I left any
brands out please let me know down below
I did as much research as I can and I
tried to follow the whole entire brands
list on Sephora it was very very
time-consuming but like I said if I miss
something let me know down below let's
go ahead and jump into skincare guys
let's start with the youth to the People
brand they are a hundred percent vegan
as well as cruelty free on this list we
also have a drunk elephant ola
Hendrickson first aid beauty I was a
little unsure of their cruelty-free
status but it is official that they are
cruelty free brands still talk to Harper
a glow recipe we also have pharmacy
perricone MD super goop which is the
brand that does a lot of different
sunscreens they are cruelty free Sunday
Riley cope re who I've been very
interested in trying out some of their
products I know logical harmony talks a
lot about their vegan products they have
like a makeup melt away sort of
cleansing balm but a lot of people are
saying is just a glorified coconut oil
but I just kind of want to try it they
also have a lot of hair care products as
well we also have tatcha on this list as
well as Jack Black if you are looking
for a brand as for our skincare is
concern for men Jack Black has a lot of
different like grooming sort of tools as
well as grooming like beard cream and
beard bucking shampoo and they also do
have some really really good lip balms
we also have Korres on this list as well
as LX mi which is 100% vegan I had never
heard of this brand I went to look at
the Sephora website it looks like they
have three different products and all of
them have a great rating so I'm pretty
interested in that brand now alright as
far as hair care is concerned anything
from Drybar is cruelty free as well as
the tangle teezer brand they do a lot of
detangling of brushes as well as a bio
ionic now let's get into some beauty
tools a makeup eraser is a 100% vegan
we also have Beauty Blender which is a
100% vegan and then of foreo biryeo is a
really great brand they have those
little tiny silicone cleansing devices
really really enjoy those I no longer
purchase from Beauty Blender I
personally like my Real Techniques
sponges the miracle complexion sponge
but I have a ton of makeup erasers
those really do work and they last
forever I finally guys let's get into
the mist
category let's talk about how nutrition
they are a supplement company I actually
have purchased every single supplement
that they have and I have tried them all
out I'm a big believer in Homme
nutrition right now I am vegan I am not
eating any dairy or meat currently I
know I go on and off I was actually
raised vegan I plan on doing a
miscellaneous Monday for you guys
talking about my childhood and all that
kind of stuff but based on my health and
how I'm usually feeling I will go back
and forth between you know what my body
needs and what I would like to be eating
so anyway hub nutrition is 100% cruelty
free now all of their supplements are
vegan but the majority of them are we
have to have la vanilla on the list this
is my favorite deodorant right now I
loved Tarts clean Queen vegan deodorant
that was my all-time favorite natural
beauty a sort of deodorant you know
something that doesn't have like
aluminum in it but now I am back to
using la vanilla I currently have on me
I think it's called these summer spice
or something like that that's the one
I'm wearing today natural deodorant does
take a little bit of getting used to but
it is much better for your body I would
highly recommend you guys look into it
especially if you do suffer from
autoimmune conditions like I personally
do deborah lippmann is a brand that you
can purchase cruelty free nail polishes
from Elizabeth and James they are a
vegan and cruelty free brand as far as
perfumes are concerned
I love the Nirvana white - nirvana black
bourbon and rose beautiful beautiful
fragrances and finally guys pin rose
this is a fragrance company I have not
tried anything from them but they are
cruelty free as well as a hundred
percent of vegan so I hope that this
video was helpful to you guys thank you
so much for joining me I get very very
excited to film videos like this because
I feel like they will make a difference
somehow and this is something that has
really really inspired me over the last
year and a half just going cruelty free
has inspired me a lot as a person so
anyway that's it don't get all mushy and
ah oh
no but thank you so much for joining me
guys I really hope you enjoyed this
video and I will see you guys on
