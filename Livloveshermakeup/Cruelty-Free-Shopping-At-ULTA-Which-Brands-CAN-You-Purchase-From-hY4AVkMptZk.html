back to my channel today we are focusing
on a cruelty-free shopping at Ulta I
made a huge list here of haircare
skincare and makeup that you can
actually purchase at Ulta that is
cruelty free if you are not into the
whole cruelty-free stance that's totally
fine maybe you still want to go ahead
and screenshot this which I will go
ahead and leave the list down below any
comments I'm going to go ahead and pin
it to the top so you guys can actually
bring this along shopping with you if
you would like to but even if you're not
into the whole cruelty-free thing I
think it is a nice to know of the brands
that do test on animals and some brands
that don't so today we're not going to
be focusing on the brands that do test
on animals we're just going to focus on
the brands that do not test on animals
and I'm very very excited I really wish
that like these Sephora and Ulta calm
websites had little tabs where you could
actually filter through and be like
cruelty free or vegan or something like
that that would be awesome
but obviously they don't so anyway here
is the little list let's go ahead and
jump right into it the first thing I
want to talk about is cruelty free and
makeup brands the first one on the list
is the Ulta and yes the in a store house
a brand from also does not test on
animals which is awesome if you guys
didn't know the Sephora house brand does
tests on animals and and they have some
really really awesome makeup and
skincare items now the Ulta brand in my
opinion it doesn't necessarily have the
best of makeup items but they do have
some good skincare items I'm gonna do a
battle of these two for Aversa zalta
house brands for you guys let me know if
you're interested in seeing that video
but yeah Aalto beauty brand does not
test on animals which is awesome next we
have a newer addition to the ulta.com
website that this brand is called dose
of colors and dose of colors is kind of
like one of those indie brands I have
not actually purchased anything from
this brand by I am definitely looking
forward to trying them out and yeah they
are cruelty free next we have positions
of formula so yes you can find some
drugstore brands that do not test on
animals which is great Physicians
Formula wet and wild absolutely awesome
so that is great news
also it cause medical air pear and
company does actually test on animals if
you didn't know it cosmetics is owned by
L'Oreal a cosmetics does not test on
animals they have some fabulous
anti-aging products on the market also
BH Cosmetics BH Cosmetics has been
releasing some really awesome pallets
lately I really want to go ahead and try
out some of their foiled palettes I've
heard those are absolutely awesome but
yeah the collaboration with Carli bybel
all that kind of stuff really really
good stuff alright next we have an NYX
Cosmetics their parent company does
actually test on animals but they
themselves do not test on animals they
have some fantastic products they have
good face products they have really nice
of blushes and highlighters and they
have some fantastic foiled eyeshadows
they're called the prismatic eye shadows
they also have some wonderful eyeshadow
palettes so would highly recommend you
guys check them out next we have
Smashbox Smashbox is actually a kind of
a newer brand to the cruelty-free
illicit they no longer test on animals
which is awesome their parent company is
not cruelty free but they themselves are
and we also have buxom on here so buxom
is actually owned by them
I believe it's Kosei which is the brand
that owns Tarte cosmetics I think and
they also own bare minerals and some
other brands but buxom obviously their
parent company does tests on animals
just like Tarte cosmetics parent company
which is what they want I think does
test on animals but buck 70 it's kind of
a brand that I feel like I was really
good mascaras I haven't necessarily
tried too much from the brand but I've
heard they have good mascaras and as far
as Smashbox is concerned I really feel
like they have some nice products they
have some good primers I feel like right
now they're really really pushing the
whole primer thing like oh my god we
invented primers over here which they
kind of did but at the same time
I wish they were kind of like lay back
on that a little bit but yeah there are
some fantastic products from Smashbox
fantastic products from buxom or at
least the mascaras I've tried from buxom
are really good
next we do have Becca cosmetics Becca
cosmetics it was my brand of the month
for June if you want to see that video
I'll go ahead and throw it up in the
cards fantastic brand in my opinion they
also are owned by a parent company that
does tests on animals that they
themselves do not which is awesome and
they have some wonderful highlighters a
wonderful blushes wonderful face
products in my opinion and I haven't
really tried out any foundations from
Becca cosmetics maybe I tried their
ultimate creme coverage one I can't
remember but what I really like is their
blushes their highlighters that kind of
face product alright next we do have elf
cosmetics elf cosmetics does not test on
animals I feel like they're really
really good brand honestly you can get
some really really high quality products
for a very very low price today I do
have on at the face products that I'm
wearing are actually from elf cosmetics
from the beautifully bare of face
palette so that is awesome we also have
urban decay on the list urban decay make
some fantastic foundations they make a
really really good at face products in
general as well not so much
and I should say base products not face
products so face product more like
blushes and highlights but base products
they make great foundations they make
great concealers so I really really love
Urban Decay unfortunately their parent
company does also test on animals but
they themselves do not next we have
Oprah cosmetics as well as pur cosmetics
I'm not the biggest fan of pure
cosmetics I feel like I'm just a little
salty because I was having some issues
with their brand they really reached out
to me a 4pr kind of stuff and they
wanted to send me things and I started
giving a very honest reviews on my
channel and they actually kind of pulled
me off their PR list so I haven't talked
very openly about that but if you guys
want me to do a video all about brands
that have poked me off of their PR list
let me know because yes there are brands
that I get on the PR list and yes there
are brands that have kicked me out there
pls not to say that I don't understand
why but I'm always very honest and there
are some damn good brands out there they
keep me on their PR list I should do a
video on that as well a little salty
because you know I've liked some of the
stuff that they sent me but there's also
been products that I haven't liked and
it was just kind of weird the
back-and-forth communication that we had
going on so just want to let you guys
know but they do not test on animals and
neither does Oprah cosmetics / cosmetics
makes some great liquid lipsticks okay
and that's coming from me I am NOT
somebody who is huge on liquid lipsticks
but I will say / it does make some great
liquid lipsticks they also make some
beautiful highlighters they're kind of
like an indie brand as well next we do
have Tarte cosmetics so they are owned
by Jose so they're basically under the
umbrella of a parent company that does
tests on animals but Tarte is pretty
good I mean you guys know how I feel
about Tarte it's either a hit or a miss
but I will say their base products their
foundations their concealers that kind
of stuff is very very good most of the
time I have no more issues with some of
their I guess I shadows I always feel
like their eyeshadows are very similar
or they're either a hit or miss their
palettes are such hits or misses but yes
it's art is a cruelty-free brand and
then we also have Stila cosmetics Tila
cosmetics is a newly added one on the
list which is exciting we lost NARS
cosmetics but we have Stila now we have
Smashbox now they do not test on animals
which is fabulous next we do have bare
minerals like I said a buxom and bare
minerals are owned by the same parent
company so their parent candy
their parent company does tests on
animals that mare minerals is
cruelty free also we have honest a/c of
Beverly Hills at which I love you guys
know I am obsessed with the Anasazi of
Beverly Hills glow kits their
highlighters or face products their lip
palate everything that I try from them
I'm very impressed with so very happy
that they are cruelty free also to face
so to face is owned by Estee Lauder if
you didn't know they bought them out for
a huge amount for like billions of
dollars which was crazy but yet to face
is cruelty free and their products are
not tested on animals but of course they
are owned by Estee Lauder and sometimes
when you are giving up money to a brand
and that E is under the umbrella of a
parent company do we really know where
the money is going is they just going
straight up to Estee Lauder we don't
really know there are different levels
of kind of being cruelty free it's all
about what you feel comfortable with and
some people will not purchase from
brands that are owned by parent
companies which is why I'm mentioning
when they're owned by a parent company
but yeah I just want to let you guys
know and then finally here we have cover
FX and I feel like I might have left out
a few I tried my best to do as many as I
could but yeah we have cover up X cover
FX was really known for having it nice
like illuminating highlighters I have
tried one of them I have halo which is a
holographic it's just this gorgeous
holographic liquid it's like this bluish
pearl ish purpley color it's amazing
makes me look like a unicorn and really
enjoy that alright let's go ahead and
talk about some beauty tools that are
cruelty free Eco tools is a vegan and
cruelty free a brush brand which is
awesome we also have Real Techniques so
they are cruelty free which is amazing I
love the miracle complexion sponge --is
and those are like the only sponges that
are practically buy nowadays so very
very happy that Real Techniques is
cruelty free as far as lashes are
concerned a lot of brands say oh mink
lashes are cruelty free mink lashes are
not cruelty free and give a what
anybody says but Ardell it doesn't make
some good cruelty free and lashes so
anytime you see anything that says mink
or if it's faux mink maybe but if it's
true mink
it is not cruelty free I don't care what
brand tries to say that that is cruelty
free how are you gonna do that with a
mink okay mink our minks are very very
obviously wild animals what are you
brushing them out and taking their hair
I don't think so they're a little more
aggressive than that I don't think that
that is actually a possible to do as
some sort of a you know call it mink
actual cruelty free that's just that's
just silly but anyway yes ardell
lashes is cruelty free which is awesome
and then finally we have a Luna for Rio
the foreo products Luna frail mini the
little guys you know little silicone
devices that you can clean your face
with and they are cruelty free which is
awesome unfortunately Clarisonic it's
not so I don't think I'll be buying any
more brushes before my Clarisonic but I
just wanted to let you guys know all
right let's go ahead and talk about some
skin care brands that are cruelty free
the first one is the body shop they are
actually owned up by L'Oreal so their
parent company does tests on animals but
they themselves have been very very out
there and really outspoken about testing
and on animals they've been very much
about like let's not do this so they are
a good brand the yes to brand yes to
grapefruit yes to blueberries yes to
banana yes to whatever and they have a
lot of different products I'm a hits and
misses area guys I gotta say I have
tried it the I feel like I've tried
every single version of the facial cloth
I did like the blueberry one I did not
like the tomato I did not like the
cucumber I did not like the grapefruit
one so I did like the blueberry and then
one of my favorite eye creams is
actually from the yes - grapefruit line
it's a dark circle correcting eye cream
it's really really fabulous so and there
are some good products in that brand but
you just kind of have to there's a
little bits of hits and misses just want
to let you guys know next we have an
dilute natural dye have never tried
anything from them I believe a lot of
their products are vegan as well I am
looking into that brand and there are a
lot of dupes for like high-end skin care
products so a leg Peter Thomas Roth has
that pumpkin enzyme mask they have with
a glycolic honey pumpkin Maseo again
they have a lot of dupes I will
definitely try that brand out and keep
you guys updated next we have cool Akula
is not a brand that I personally like
I've tried some of their skincare items
and they have a lot of those sunscreen
based products I still find them
extremely extremely greasy and gross and
I'm just so not into it so I'm kind of
passing on kula but they are cruelty
free birth disease is a cruelty free
they were not for a while they're
 my boy like how can birds be and
not be cruelty free but they are back to
being cruelty free absolutely obsessed
with their cleansing oil with argon and
coconut oils and that is what I have
been using or to remove my makeup for
like two months now love it would highly
recommend next we have elbow pads
Chanukah on another great brand they
have a really good unpatrolled le they
have some wonderful
scrubs and they also have a really nice
toner it's like a Hawaiian Tropic kind
of toner
Hawaiian Tropic the next
sunscreen bread it's like a Hawaiian
Kukui nuts are sort of toner it's really
really good all right next we have
Pacifica love a Pacifica skincare not so
much the makeup they need to work on the
makeup a lot of their products are vegan
I think the majority of them are as well
I find that vegan makeup can be a little
like hit and miss I don't know about you
guys but let me know if you want me to
do a video kind of like testing out
vegan makeup makeup a V&amp;amp;M makeup but
yeah Pacifica is a cruelty-free brand
which is awesome like I said they have
some wonderful skin care products which
I love all right next we have derma e
have not really tried too much from
Germany I did try there a night cream it
kind of smelled like bubblegum and it
was actually very nice and calming kinda
remind me a little bit of like these
Cetaphil moisturizing cream which
Cetaphil does tests on animals so that
kind of you know feel and very very nice
and natural not natural but
non-irritating is sort of cream if
you're looking into something like that
definitely check out check out derma e
because they have a lot of products like
that a Juice Beauty my mom is currently
using a bunch of products from them I
remember kind of liking some of their
products but some other products are
also very very harsh on the skin they
use a lot of lemon and lime extracts um
but they are curl d free if you are a
little more problematic skinned if you
have a little more oily skin I think
that the dudes beauty line would be nice
for you I'm not so much oily anymore now
that we are here in the desert I'm a
little more unlike the normal side I
haven't really gotten any sort of
oiliness on my skin or breakouts lately
which is crazy but yeah definitely check
them out if you do if you are looking
for a natural cruelty free and I think
they are vegan as well options for
clearing up acne some of their products
are pretty good next we have the hemp
brand I've been obsessed with the hemp
spread they are cruelty free they are
vegan they have some awesome awesome
scrubs they have in wash of body of
moisturizers or in shower body of
moisturizers which are so so nice all of
their stuff smells so good yeah
really into the hemp spray on Perricone
md haven't really tried anything from
the brand but they are cruelty free
which is awesome skin iceland is also
cruelty free the few products that I've
tried from them I haven't been crazy
about there's been an eye cream and some
under eye patches they do tend to use a
lot of like cooling a product so those
can be a little irritating on the skin
but they are if you're into that kind of
stuff they are cruelty free Michael Todd
I have tried out their pumpkin mask
which is awesome they have some very
skincare products as well first a beauty
which is a favorite for a lot of people
unfortunately for me I really don't like
a lot of products from first aid beauty
but they are cruelty for you just wanted
to put that out there and then at
Dermalogica their parent company is not
cruelty free they do tests on animals
but Dermalogica themselves do not test
their products on animals I have not
tried anything from Dermalogica I know
so many of you have recommended I do so
let me know down below if you have any
products in particular that you would
like me to try out alright and finally
let's talk about some haircare brands
that are cruelty free at Ulta the first
one is pure ology pure ology is owned by
parent company that does a test on
animals about their products like I said
are not tested on animals also Conair I
don't know why but like they're heating
tools and all this kinda stuff I can
understand why they're not cruelty free
but I've always associated Conair with
like different kind of like Herbal
Essences and all these kind of brands
that do tests on animals so anyway they
do not test on animals cruelty free all
that good stuff Paul Mitchell does not
test on animals which is awesome
a Giovanni which is a really really
beautiful I believe they're also a vegan
haircare brand they have some really
really nice conditioners a very very
gentle I have been using one of their
conditioners lately and you guys know I
have scalp problems so I feel like that
says a lot do they have some good
products a dry bar does not test on
animals so if you are into like their
Saki bomb you know their dry shampoo and
all that kind of stuff they do not test
which is great and then finally bio
ionica which is a hair tools a brand so
anyway guys I hope that this video was
somewhat helpful like I said I will go
ahead and leave this list it down below
I will pin it to the top in a comment
and yeah that's pretty much it let me
know if you want me to do one of these
on it Sephora as well so that's it for
