my channel today's video is going to be
all about cult favourite beauty products
or not beauty products just make up and
let me know if you want me to do like a
beauty Edition where I talk about
skincare haircare maybe not haircare
skincare I don't do much with my hair
but uh yeah let me know if you guys
would like that also maybe a part two to
this because I feel like there are a lot
of products that I left out I just
didn't want this to be like a 40-minute
video but I tried to take products that
I know a lot of people like and I wanted
to give you guys in my opinion on
whether I like them or not so let's go
ahead and jump right into it we are
going to start with eyeshadow palettes
the first one I want to talk about is
the lorac Pro palette this is something
that is talked about very very often on
YouTube and I have to say it is so so so
good you guys can probably see right
here this is definitely a very loved
palette in my collection I think it's
wonderful the pro formula is excellent
from lorac seriously one of the best
formulas like on the market the actual
mattes and shimmers have the same sort
of consistency longevity and blend
ability on the eyes which is amazing so
would highly recommend that to you guys
here's one from the drugstore this is
the Wet n Wild comfort zone 8 pan at
palette I've had to go through three of
these because two of them shattered
while I was traveling I actually used
the overnighter bag from Sephora as well
as bubble wrap my palettes when I travel
but I have had two of these shatter
which is so unfortunate but yeah
basically this has eight different
shades in here very very neutral this
one right here is definitely a dupe for
the max of blue brown pigment from the
like swatches I've seen online but yeah
it's a beautiful beautiful everyday
friendly kind of palette it does not
have any sort of mattes in here and this
yellow shade is a little dark for me as
an actual brow bone highlight but still
really good quality you can get this for
under $5 at the drugstore would highly
recommend next we do have the chocolate
bar palette so I did talk about recently
when I said arrests and fees to face
that video I'll go ahead and throw up in
the cards I talked about how I don't
know if the old-school products from a
Too Faced are going to be the same now
but if they are going to be the same I
would highly highly recommend going
ahead and purchasing a chocolate bar
palette and this one is my favorite it
is the semi-sweet version and why I like
this so much is because it has cool
tones and warm tones in it now if you
want the original one which I declutter
too my friend
that one leaves in my
a little more on the warm tone side and
then the chocolate bon bons palette
leans a little more cool tone but I just
wanted a mixture of them so I kept this
one it is my favorite love love love
this
my favorite shades are bonbons caramel
and a butter pecan so would highly
recommend those and then lastly we do
have the Anasazi of Beverly Hills modern
a renaissance palette again would highly
recommend I know it's very hyped up but
it's so worth it they are coming out
with like a sister palette to this it
has a lot of like mossy green cool toned
colors in there very excited to get my
hands on that but yeah I really like
this like if you have a fair complexion
and you really want to try out some like
red and berry eyeshadows this will not
make you look sick they have just the
right amount of warmth in there and this
shade realgar right here so stunning I
don't see a lot of palettes with that
kind of color so yeah this is something
I really really do enjoy and again would
highly recommend you guys to check out
all right now let's go ahead and talk
about foundations the first one I want
to talk about is these Giorgio Armani
luminous silk foundation I do wear the
shade number two and unfortunately I am
in love with this now they do test on
animals so I will not be repurchasing
again but it is a beautiful foundation
and I can see why it's very very hyped
about so basically it has like a nice
medium solid I would say yeah solid
medium coverage but it really really
gives a beautiful luminosity to the skin
and gives you very like dull like skin
if that makes sense
I notice I can't wear this during the
summer time because I get oily in my
t-zone but this is something I would
recommend for those of you with normal
to dry skin for sure if you do have oily
skin I would go ahead and use a
mattifying primer next we do have a
cruelty free foundation this is the
Urban Decay Naked skin and weightless
definition makeup I've done a first
impressions on this I'll throw it up in
the cards or link it down below I wear
these shades 0.5 totally worth the money
you guys absolutely stunning and
beautiful on the skin I still have not
tried out to the matching concealer but
if it's as good as this I feel like I'm
gonna like it a lot of the products from
The Naked skin line are very good
quality there been a few here and there
that aren't as great but this is an
excellent foundation I would say you can
get it up to a medium coverage it just
has a natural looking finish and I feel
like this would work for dry skin mature
skin normal skin combo skin oily skin
everyone really really like that next we
do have the Kat Von D lock-it tattoo at
foundation I used to wear this all the
time when I was in high school and also
college unfortunately this just does not
work for me anymore this particular
sheet is light for
- it's too heavy on my skin and it just
looks too cakey and I think that my skin
is just aging a little more to be
completely honest I know I'm only like
25ish but still look around this area
and especially around like this area I'm
starting to get a little bit of fine
lines and more texture this just
emphasizes it I've tried it with every
sort of primer and oil and it's just not
for me so if you do have more mature or
dry skin or aging skin you're probably
not going to like this but if you are an
oily beast you have a lot to cover you
would probably enjoy it alright next so
we do have a two foundations from the
drugstore we have the L'Oreal infallible
Pro matte and the L'Oreal infallible Pro
glow I wear two zero one in the pro blow
and one zero one in the Pro matte love
the pro matte and the actual finish it
gives reminds me a lot of the Tarte
Amazonian clay full coverage so if you
want a cruelty-free option I would get
that one but yeah this is a beautiful
beautiful foundation I love that it's
matte and it gives full coverage without
feeling super heavy now the pro glow I'm
not the biggest fan of I just feel like
for my combo skin it does kind of slip
and slide I don't think it gives the
greatest coverage but I have seen so
many people on YouTube that have dry
skin and normal skin that absolutely
love this so I mean you could check it
out if you're into it but for me this is
not something that I'm super excited
about alright now let's go into
concealers the first one I want to talk
about is one that I'm actually going to
be returning this is the NARS radiant
creamy concealer in the shade Chantilly
so I got this during the Sephora vib
sale I'm saving up some products so that
I can go and do a big run or a big
return that's what I do all the time of
you were asking me like do I ever feel
embarrassed how no I spend so much money
as Sephora so I just kind of gather up
stuff that's not working for me and then
I bring it back like why would I waste
my money but anyway this is what it
looks like the shade is pretty darn good
but this was not what I was expecting
everybody says this is so fantastic and
so amazing and honestly I'm just kind of
like I don't see it it has a really
really moosie kind of consistency it
does not give a radiant glow or any sort
of glow underneath my eyes and it really
doesn't have that great of coverage so
definitely not something I would
recommend to you guys now this one is
pretty darn good this is the Too Faced
Born This Way naturally radiant
concealer this one's actually radiant I
wear these shade it very fair and this
might be something I would repurchase
again I want to try some other
um you know I want to try the Urban
Decay Naked skin out and then a few from
the drugstore before I repurchase but
out of all the concealers I'm showing
here this is really good quality so it's
really beautiful it wasn't until I use
the NARS that I realize how much I
actually liked this concealer it will
give you a light to medium coverage
really beautiful underneath the eyes
doesn't settle into fine lines and
wrinkles and it is good for spot
concealing so I would recommend that one
I think it is worth the hype and then
here we have the chargesheet tape
correcting concealer sorry guys I
literally have Vaseline on my lips
because I was practicing today so anyway
this is the Tarte shake tape concealer
in the shade fair and yeah I think this
is not completely worth the hype I'm not
going to say it's horrible it's not
something I would repurchase um you get
a big tube here as you guys can see but
I would highly recommend like going in
store and kind of like checking out the
formula it's very very thick as you guys
can see but not in a way like the Kat
Von D lock a tattoo concealer I actually
prefer that one because it goes on thick
but it blends out beautifully this one
takes a little bit of time to blend um
but underneath the eyes it is pretty
good you do want to set it but it really
doesn't increase that much throughout
the day my only complaint with this is
just that I feel like people glorify it
like it's freaking God or something and
I'm just like I don't see it like I
don't think it's that good so I just
wanted to let you guys know not like the
huge most biggest fan of this but it
still is a decent concealer it does give
you pretty much full coverage but I
would recommend dotting it underneath
your eyes do not like put ten pounds of
it on like a lot of people do on YouTube
you just don't need that much alright
moving on let's go ahead and talk about
highlighters I feel like the Becca
shimmering skin perfecter line whether
it's in the pressed or the liquid
version are very very hyped about and I
think the press ones are totally worth
it now I'm not a huge fan of the liquid
versions I've tried opal I've tried
moonstone in the liquid version they're
okay for mixing into foundations but
they tend to be a little bit on the
thicker side so I personally don't like
those if you wanted the liquid version I
would say if you're like more mature a
dry stint you would like that if you do
want a nice glow and you do have combo
or oily skin I would go for the pressed
version
this was their limited edition rose
quartz this one is their prismatic
amethyst which is still currently on
sale and then they have some cult
favorites like opal and then also
moonstone and shaped like that so
definitely would recommend those
here are some bronzers from the
drugstore this is like the only bronzer
I can think of that's super super super
hyped up that I actually have in my
collection
they are the Physicians Formula murumuru
butter of bronzers I'm going to say
blushes bronzers I don't think the
blushes are worth it but you know what
these guys are so so so good you guys so
the only thing I don't like is the fact
that the packaging is a little bulky and
come on the shade selection there's only
two shades these are not going to work
for you if you have like a medium or
deeper complexion you have to be very
fair for these and the two shades that
they have our bronzer and light bronzer
you really can't tell that much of a
difference between the two I would say
the light bronzer leans a little more
warm tones and then this one right here
it leaves a little more cool tone which
is why I prefer this one but they are
beautiful they smell good they're
buttery and they look very natural on
the skin so absolutely worth the hype
alright next we have the Anasazi of
Beverly Hills brow Wiz now I'm just not
super impressed with this everybody
talks about these Anasazi of Beverly
Hills brow products and honestly I've
tried a few and I just don't like any of
them so this is not something I would
recommend to you guys I know so many
people swear by these but I feel like
NYX wet and wild you know the drugstore
they have just as good a brow product so
yeah I will not be repurchasing once I
use that up all right here we have some
highlighters that are kind of like
mid-range these are the laura geller
baked gelato swirl eliminators this one
right here is a new shade a charming
pink that is what it looks like and this
one is a little more of like a cool
toned pink shade and then here we have
gilded honey which kind of started the
whole like gold highlighting craze I
guess you could say so
these are really good you guys very very
good from laura geller I'm not the
biggest fan of the majority of her line
but I will say these are beautiful they
now have like a holographic or do a
chromatic shade you can pick up too and
I do have the peach shade they're really
really beautiful if you want a facial a
highlight but you don't want something
that's going to be too crazy and you can
kind of build it up on the skin I would
highly recommend those alright so let's
talk about some mascaras the first one I
don't know where it is benefits they're
real very very good would recommend a
really really good mascara and kind of
like when benefits at the airwheel came
out also to Faced better than sex
release I remember like at Sephora this
was like when I was in high school and
both of these were so good so this one
is a natural bristle wand
then the benefit is a rubber bristle I
have not repurchased a full-size of this
yet just because uh I'm kind of like if
you right now with two-face but this is
a beautiful mascara I want to try the
waterproof version as well because I do
notice I do notice that this flakes
throughout the day but overall very very
good mascara especially for building a
volume and then one from the drugstore
that is very much talked about easy
clump crusher by lash blast and also the
new super sizer I definitely think the
super sizer is much better than this one
but this was like back in the day people
talked about this all the time it
definitely is a cult favorite at this
particular shade I have is in a brown
and it's a beautiful rubber bristle wand
really really separates and gives nice
lashes so that is something I would
recommend as well
and then next we do have a two different
blush formulas the first one is the
Amazonian clay 12-hour formula from a
Tarte and then of course the Too Faced
love flush and blushes so with the D
chart um these ones are so good like the
little singles that are made here in the
US I find that some of their palettes
are not as good it's not like the true
Amazonian clay formula but this
particular shade is called seduce these
are incredibly long wearing they don't
have a lot of kick up they are a little
more firmly press but it actually is
kind of nice at the end of the day
because you don't get flying all
over your face so that is what these
shades seduce looks like this was from
the naughty news collection would highly
recommend scooping one of these up and
having it in your collection and then
they love flush long-lasting
sixteen-hour blushes are my favorite
blush formula on the market so this is
what they look like on the inside I do
own all six of them in full-size and
this is in the shade justify it my love
so the reason why I like these is
because they blend easily they're
beautiful on the skin they have like a
little bit of a I don't even want to say
a sheen just like a nice glossy look to
them they're not completely matte and
then on top of that I feel like they do
kind of cater to all sorts of different
skin tones like the shade um your love
is king would look beautiful on deep
complexions this one right here is
beautiful on fair complexions and they
wear all day long I would say that they
wear even better than the tarte dare i
say so but i feel like it they really
really these two guys right here are
great for all-day wear on the cheek so
those are the two formulas that want to
talk about would still recommend them
and don't really know what's going on
with two-face I hope that when they
start releasing more of these that
they're going to be the same kind of
formula I don't know that's for you to
decide but those are both really really
good excuse me
all right losing my voice finally guys I
want to talk about eyeliner so a very
very hyped up Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on
eye pencils I have like 13 of these I
love them love them love them love them
so they're not so hard to get off like
they don't stay on to the point where
you're rubbing and rubbing and rubbing
your eyes at night time like right now
I'm wearing the it cosmetics no tub
waterproof gel eyeliner this is
practically impossible to get off my
waterline these don't do that but they
still wear a very very long time so
they're an easy to get off I feel like
they wear a nice amount of time on the
waterline I never seem to get it in like
the inner corner or like little smudges
out here they're beautiful this one
right here is perversion which is a
matte black we have the shade of Voodoo
which is a really gorgeous kind of
purpley shade Muse's a nice kind of
satiny cool toned brown shade and then
stargazer a gold if you just want to try
out a bunch of different colors I would
recommend this formula it's very very
good and yeah that's pretty much it so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video let me
know what you think of these products
down below and let me know if you would
like me to do a part two so that I can
include some more products but yeah I
will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
