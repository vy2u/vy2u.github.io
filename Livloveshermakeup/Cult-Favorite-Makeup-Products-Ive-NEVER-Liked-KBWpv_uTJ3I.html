morning I was on the sephora.com website
and I was kind of scrolling through the
new releases and then also I went to the
bestsellers tab and I was like this is a
bunch of cuz it's all braked
okay there were literally a products
that just released a few days ago that
are already listed as bestsellers like
come on Safari get your together
I was kind of looking around in there
and I was thinking and I really don't
like a lot of the stuff here but what a
surprise me not liking certain products
you guys know but for real
there are a lot of cult favorites out
there like the lorac Pro palette and you
know as stuff like that oh gee palettes
that I'm totally into but there's some
that I'm absolutely not and I never have
been and I never will be so I'm gonna
share with you guys 5 a different makeup
products that I just never fell for the
hype I know that they have a cult
following but I'm not one of the members
okay alright so the first item is the
honest tossing at Beverly Hills a dip
brow it's just not meant to be you know
you have to have a certain level of
skill to carve your brows out like that
and that feel level it was just not
there for me and I'm okay with that I
have accepted the fact that I usually
just put eyeshadow in my brows which is
what I did today I was putting a little
bit of you know crease color on and I
thought okay well my brow pencil is
downstairs why would I go down there and
get it I can just put this in my brows
and that's literally what we have going
on so either I basically will carve them
out with my little Smashbox brow tech to
go and make them look like huge
caterpillars or they just look like this
every single day I can't do the
concealer and then the powder and then
baking your eyebrow note to the anasazi
of beverly hills dipbrow note to the
majority of the anasazi of Beverly Hills
brow products in general they just don't
work for me all right
up next we have the NARS radiant creamy
concealer not very radiant and not very
creamy okay I felt like this was super
super moosie I got the shade of
Chantilly and it wasn't taste like match
for me but I mean it horrible wear time
really made my under eye look quite dry
especially when I was using it down here
in the desert so that's definitely a
product that I feel like a lot of people
love and I definitely did not know
number three is the Laura Mercier
translucent loose setting powder I've
gone through three full sizes of this
trying to understand why everybody is so
obsessed with it now I refuse to bake my
under eye with like a $35 powder it's
usually like you see me panning the elf
tone correcting powder and cool or the
essence all about
fixing compact powder because I feel
like I'd go through powders quickly I'm
not about to you know wipe that
away
like literally bake my eye and then wipe
away $35 I'm sorry so I know that's how
most people do it but I got it because I
just wanted to use it like a normal
person patter and it really didn't do
anything okay I feel like a lot of loose
powders are similar and if you really
want to get a good one go with the
silica powder as long as you're not
allergic because they're so fun we
milled they're so silky and yeah
honestly I prefer my alpha $5 HD is
setting powder up next at the Too Faced
Born This Way of foundation this felt so
heavy on my skin and I'm almost
wondering if I should go ahead and
retest it now that I do have dry skin
when I did it use this I had very very
oily skin all I remember is going to
Sephora okay it was actually the Sephora
I was working at and I was like I'm
gonna get the new Too Faced foundation
and I open it up and like the shade is
like banana yellow okay the
lightest shade the darker shades were
horrible just the medium shades like if
you had a medium complexion this
foundation was gonna be great for you
they have since gone ahead and extended
the shade range on both ends which is
good but yeah crappy a shade range it
oxidizes like crazy it feels very heavy
on the skin kind of reminds me of like
the Urban Decay all nighter but with
like half a pump of oil in it like a big
pump of oil it just feels uncomfortable
on the skin throughout the day and I
don't like that heavy feeling so I
probably actually won't retest it I
thought maybe I should because I have
dry skin but you know what
I don't have to like everything that
everybody likes okay and finally guys
the Urban Decay Naked palette if you
have watched my channel from the
beginning when I started about two and a
half three years ago the first declutter
I ever did I was like goodbye naked one
naked two naked 3 and smoky palette I
always get asked that my declutter
videos do you decide on the spot yes I
do I decide with you guys I don't
pre-plan this I don't live my life
like that yes I did purchase all of them
because at the time it was so hyped
about and the only YouTube tutorial you
could find was like using the Naked
palette but mats were hard to blend
shimmers were not nearly as nice as
Urban Decay shimmers are nowadays
glitter in few shades lots of fallout
you really had to build the colors up I
just wasn't into it I just really wasn't
into it
I kept purchasing them because that's
again the only thing that people were
using on YouTube but yeah Nicki palettes
not to afford me so anyway
guys let me know what you think of these
products down below and also let me know
of a cult favorite that you're not a
huge fan out and that you think is piece
of and you're like how do people
like this okay see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
