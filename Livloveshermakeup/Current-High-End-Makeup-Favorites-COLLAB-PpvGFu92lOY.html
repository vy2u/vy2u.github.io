this video I'm sharing with you guys my
current high end makeup favorites this
is going to be a collab video with my
friend Jana cookie here on YouTube I'm
going to go ahead and link her video of
her channel and also her instagram down
below in the description bar it will be
the first thing you see I would love if
you guys went over and told her I say
hello checked out her channel I think
she's really really wonderful she's a
very genuine person she has a kick-ass
makeup collection and she knows a lot
about what she's talking about which i
think is fantastic so I highly recommend
that you guys go over and tell her and
say hello check out her Channel stick
around a little bit and also i have to
say is she is very good friends with my
idol here on youtube Kristen from mama
loves mascara so that makes me love her
even more because Kristen is the reason
I started my youtube channel so I love
her and I love Jana as well so I hope
you guys will go over and tell her I say
hello but yeah let's just get into it
I'm about I don't know two or three
weeks ago I did a video like my top ten
under ten so that was kind of like my
current favorites from the drugstore so
now i'm going to be sharing with you buy
some of my current height and makeup
favorites that maybe you haven't heard
me talking about recently so let's get
started i'm going to go ahead and start
with highlighters there are a three
different kind of highlights I don't
want to say different kind of highlights
there are three different highlighters
that are high-end I've been enjoying
they are from the same sort of color
family and that is like a light pink
iridescent highlight I've been really
really into that I don't know why I
think it's because I actually do have a
cool undertone in my skin and I love a
gold highlight I always thought that
looked amazing but i have to say i have
noticed that light pink highlights if
you have fair skin and like a cool
undertone really are very very
complimentary towards your skin tone so
i feel like these look a lot better on
my skin than a gold highlight not that
i'm going to stop wearing gold
highlights but i feel like these kind of
colors are a lot more complimentary and
I've really been into it so the first
one I want to share with you guys is the
Urban Decay afterglow eight-hour powder
highlighter in the shade aura so this is
what it looks like it's a beautiful kind
of pinky purple iridescent color there
is swatched and I'm going to swatch all
of three of these next to each other so
you guys can see we can do a little
battle of
highlighters here so here is the Urban
Decay afterglow highlighter in the shade
aura the second favorite that I've been
loving is my Dior glowing Gardens
illuminator in the shade is 001 glowing
pink this also has that kind of pinky
tone to it but it's more of a like white
under town if that makes sense and this
one and the next one I'm going to show
you have a baked j'allais formula which
I really really have been enjoying as
well and then the third one is the Laura
Geller baked gelato swirl illuminator in
the shade charming pink and this one has
a little more of a pinky undertone so
they are very very similar this one
again has a big delay of formulation to
it they're beautiful on the skin but
they are different but I just really
really like this like light pink thing
that's been going on lately I've been
really really like craving these colors
on my skin I like to put them you know
down the bridge of my nose on my
cheekbones I think they're beautiful and
very very complimentary if you do have
fair skin with cool undertones so here
we have aura then we have a glowing pink
from Dior and then there is the Laura
Geller baked gelato swirl illuminator in
the shade charming pink so they're all
really really beautiful I would say aura
has a little more of a purpley undertone
charming pink has more of a pink and
then you can see the glowing gardens
have a little more of like an iridescent
white undertone so anyway I've been
really really into at the baked jalade
formulation and also really really into
like pink highlighters alright moving on
the next thing I want to talk about is a
bronzer that I've recently purchased
that I've really just been it's been
driving me crazy like I love it like in
a good way it's been driving me crazy in
a good way it is the two-faced
sweethearts bronzer in the shade sweet
tea and this is what it looks like it's
beautiful it's that kind of a cool tone
over here in the nabe or more tone over
here again if you have like fair skin
with a cool undertone and you take a
really fluffy brush swirl it in here and
dust it all over your face it looks
gorgeous it's so so so beautiful I do
find that these what are these the
two-phase sweethearts um blushes have a
little more like chunks of glitter and
grit in them than the bronzer does the
bronzer just has a really like finely
milled formulation to it and the
sparkles in there aren't really sparkles
they're more like
or glimmer so let me go ahead and swatch
it here so you guys can see it's really
really beautiful on the skin it gets a
lot of glow and I just feel like my skin
is glowing and looks very youthful when
I wear this so that has definitely been
a favorite the next favorite is actually
a little blush palette and this is no
longer available this is the benefit to
real cheeky palette real cheeky party
palette it's super super bulk horrible
packaging to leave it have a mirror I
already used up the highlights the
eyeliner and the mascara all I have left
are the bronzer and then these four
blushes here I do plan on d plotting
these because this is like the biggest
chunky as clunky as packaging ever but I
really have been enjoying benefit
blushes and also the hoola bronzer
because I feel like they're very very
subtle if that makes sense um they give
like a nice wash of color on your cheeks
without looking overdone literally every
single one of them hula is gorgeous
because it's just this cool tone matte
bronzer really works on a lot of
different skin tones rocket or you know
Dan's a line these are all colors that
are very very beautiful and coralista is
really well known as well these are all
just colors that are really really
gorgeous and well known however I feel
like the reason they're so Universal is
the fact that they're not overdone
they're not too bright to their very
very subtle and they look beautiful on
the cheeks and i find that i can use
every single shade in here and have just
a nice beautiful kind of glowy cheek
going on and i really really enjoy that
so that has been a favorite the next
thing i want to talk about is the
lancome hypnose drama mascara i have six
deluxe sized samples of this mascara i
have yet to have had to purchase a full
size of this i get these as like hundred
point perks once in a while and i have
six of them laying around like i have
not had to go ahead and purchase a full
size yet but this mascara is amazing
it's got a beautiful beautiful want it
has a very wet slick formula not so much
like an oily formula but more just like
a wet formula so if you don't like that
you definitely won't like this it smells
amazing like what the heck it smells
amazing it smells like fruit literally
but it has this tiny little bit of a
curve to it I don't know what it is but
this is beautiful on top of like a base
mascara so you could use something like
I don't know covergirl clump crusher
and then top it with this it looks like
you have false lashes like it is such an
amazing mascara this has quickly just
become a favorite of mine for sure
alright the next thing I want to talk
about are some primers again these are
samples because i haven't had to go and
purchase full sizes yet because i have
so many so i actually have nine yes nine
of these little deluxe ice samples of
the smashbox primer oil i have been
really really into these and you guys
can tell like i haven't had to bertos
like I said the full size yet I have it
on my love's list waiting and I have the
lip Lancome Hypnose drama as well
waiting on the list for when I need to
get them but this is an amazing amazing
primer oil I really enjoy it if you do
have oily or combo skin like me all you
need is like a few drops I kind of rub
it between my hands warm it up and then
I Pat it into my skin I love that it
moisturizes my skin and also prolongs
the wear of my makeup and I find that
Smashbox primers really are the best I
mean honestly like they were the first
ones to come out with the whole like
primer thing and I feel like they have
the best quality they truly do make my
makeup you know stay on my face longer
so I really like that they released this
primer oil a little goes a long way
again I haven't had to purchase the full
size yet if you can get your hands on a
little deluxe size sample i highly
recommend doing so and yeah really been
enjoying that and then the second one is
the bobby brown vitamin-enriched
facespace i have four of these so i
haven't had to purchase a full-size yet
this smells like lemon cake it's
beautiful I don't know what it is I
thought that this was going to be a very
very like moisturizing product you can
see it's a very thick it is quite
humectant it definitely like locks in
moisture on the skin but when you're
rubbing it in it almost feels like a
silicone or pore filling and primer and
I don't actually know if there's damn
epic own in here but it just smooths the
appearance of the skin it smells amazing
like a lemon bar oh it smells so good
but it just makes the skin feels so nice
it has a little bit of a tacky texture
which is helpful when you're putting on
your foundation because you really want
it to stick to your base I don't know
what it is I'm just in love with this I
really thought it wasn't going to be
anything
so this was one of those products where
you like type in the code and yeah I
have quite a few of these and I really
really have been enjoying that as far as
foundations are concerned there are two
hear that I have been going to very very
frequently and maybe the reason you
haven't seen me talk about them in my
fails and holy grails is because I've
been using them more as a base and then
putting a heavier foundation on top of
because I like full coverage like I'm
just a full coverage kind of girl but as
of late like the past two weeks I've
been really enjoying just wearing like a
BB cream or today I'm just wearing a
tinted moisturizer on my skin these are
basically water or serum foundations
which are so popular right now it seems
like every single brand is coming out
with a serum or water foundation but my
two favorite currently have been de
laura mercier candle glow soft luminous
foundation my shade is shell and then I
also have been loving my stila off with
low serum foundation and my shade is
fair and I've tried quite a few out do
you guys know I tried out the back of
one before they came out with the new
lighter shade I did end up returning
that it wasn't a fan i also have tried
out the tart rainforest of the sea i had
like a little sample size i still think
that out of all three of those the Stila
one is the best i just love the way this
goes on and it caters to really really
fair-complected girls or boys and let me
show you guys what they look like on the
skin because they're very very similar
so there we have the Stila aqua glow and
then i'll put a pump of the laura
mercier right next to it so stila aqua
glow Laura Mercier you can see that the
Stila aqua glow definitely has a little
more um it's a little more watery but I
will say that the coverage builds up on
it a little better so here we have the
Laura Mercier one this one is beautiful
because it has like light reflecting
particles in it that really make the
skin look kind of like you know it kind
of reminds me of like the hourglass
ambient lighting powders like it just
gives that sort of like lit from within
sort of base and then here is the Stila
aqua glow I will say the Laura Mercier
looks better with just like one even
layer over the face whereas the Stila
aqua glow actually builds really
beautifully on the skin like you can get
a nice medium coverage with that product
so I really
like both of those again I have tried
out so many like serum or water
foundations they also really like the
Sephora ethereal natural finish one I
enjoy the Smashbox the BB water drops I
enjoy a lot of them but these two have
definitely been something that I have
been reaching for lately currently I
like just wearing these on their own but
a couple months ago or yeah i would say
it for like the past two months i have
been wearing these and then going in
with a heavier coverage foundation on
top i know that sounds like a lot of
foundations but i like to take my face
and it just makes them look really
beautiful because these are a nice base
product alright moving on the next two
products that I've been enjoying our my
little tart clay pots these are so fun
so you can use these as eyeliner or you
can use them as cream eyeshadow if I
could open them but this shade right
here is called rose gold it's beautiful
these are just really really nice
because like I said they kind of are
like a two in one product that you can
use that eyeliner if you know how to do
winged eyeliner I can't do winged
eyeliner for but if you know how to
do winged eyeliner you can use these for
winged eyeliner I like to put them on my
lower lashline you can take it and put
it all over like your eye as a basically
a cream eyeshadow they're very very
opaque and beautiful and creamy and
blendable and I just really really enjoy
these and i do want to pick up a few
more colors i saw that they are
releasing some really really fun kind of
vibrant shades so i'm very excited about
that so yeah i have those in rose gold
and mint and then let's talk about some
lippies that i have been enjoying I've
really been enjoying the clinique chubby
sticks so these are basically
moisturizing bombs they have three
different kinds do you have the baby
tint which is like a barely-there sort
of tint the shaded have is pop and poppy
you have the chubby stick intense which
is like obviously a little more of an
intense color this one is in mightiest
maraschino maraschino you know marshy
know how do you say that little marshy
no cherries you know you guys know what
I'm talking about anyway that's that
shade and then the last one is called
curvy candy which is a beautiful pink
color I'm going to go ahead and try and
swatch these this one is a little pop in
poppy your bear you're basically barely
going to see like you I don't know if
you can see that but anyway it's like a
barely-there sort of tint but I've been
carrying these around
in my purse because they're very very
comfortable to wear on my lips and these
actually don't rub off on my sleep head
joint so I can practice with them on so
I carried this one into my flute in my
little flute bag and then I carry these
two in my purse I really really enjoy
these and I've been using these like
non-stop for the past two months so
there we have Kirby candy which is just
the original formula the cherry wanna be
in the middle that's the intense formula
and then the pop in poppy or whatever
right there where you guys probably
can't even see it but they're very very
comfortable to wear on the lips they're
one of those like products that you just
don't have to think about their kind of
like Baby Lips you can just put them on
without a mirror they're very very easy
to use I really really enjoy them all
right let's talk a little bit about some
eyeliners I've been enjoying these
Lancome what are these drama liquid
pencils in on pule and cote de sua so
these are the two shades i have on
palais is the purple and then kotas ooh
is the blue one I really really enjoy
these like they're so beautiful they're
very reminiscent of the Urban Decay 24-7
glide on eye pencils but I feel like
these colors really pop like if you want
to put them on the waterline they really
pop they wear an incredibly long time
and I'm just really into this formula I
don't know what it is so the purple one
on pule has a little bit of glitter in
it and then Kota soooo is pretty much
kind of like a satiny matte color look
at my shitty swatches I'm living in the
view my dream like really girl I cannot
swatch to save my life I believe it on
my left handed this anyway so there we
have on Boulais and there's kakuzu
they're really beautiful they wear an
incredibly long time I think they're
gorgeous on the waterline I fine I
really like the Urban Decay 24-7 glide
on eye pencil I talk about those all the
time as you guys know however I find
that some of their like darker Purple's
or blues don't really pop on my
waterline like I have to use a really
really like bright one to really get
that look on my waterline of like boom
there's color right there I find that
some of their jewel-toned like shades
just don't really look like anything
they look kind of muddled and muddy on
my waterline so i really like these ones
from Lancome alright moving on less
about something that I have talked about
non-stop and you guys are probably gonna
roll your eyes when I say it but I have
to include them I urban just skate and
Urban Decay armand de que color
correcting fluids I'm cest you guys I'm
obsessed with these I talk about them
all the time but these have just been an
obsession for literally like the past
three months we have the green shade
these are the-- naked skin like i said
color correcting fluids we have the pink
one the yellow one the lavender the
peach I've used them all it for the same
thing but you can basically they're like
a multitasking sort of products like if
you have fair skin and you want to
brighten underneath your eye area and
you also want to like cover a peck or
pigmentation you can get the pay shade
if you have more of a yellow undertone
but you're still fair you can use the
yellow one if you just have redness on
your face use the green one if you have
like aging skin and lots of fine lines
and wrinkles use the purple one to fill
them in and if you have like medium to
deep skin tones you want to fit um fill
in if you want to cover up dark circles
and hyperpigmentation you can get the
peach one they're amazing they're
extremely creamy and blendable I just
can't I can't even I love the applicator
i love the formulation I'm obsessed with
everything about these so there is the
peach one on the back of my hand I know
I talk about these all the time but I
had to get them them because they're
always favorites all right and then the
last thing I want to talk about is
something that I never talked about I
actually did a review on this product
and I kind of was like it's just okay I
believe this is on sale right now so
highly recommend if you do have fair
skin and you're looking for a palette
filled with transition colors I have
been reaching for this for probably the
past three months for a transition shade
every single day and I have been using
like pellets that have nice transition
colors but there's something about the
lorac new necessities college that just
like has my name written all over it you
get so many gorgeous matte shades in
here that are great for transition you
know transition colors in your crease I
mean you have cool tones warm tones
again if you have like medium to deep
skin tones I don't think half of these
would even show up on you and I stated
that in my review of this product I got
that it did it really cater to everybody
but there are just so many gorgeous like
light like a baby and like
ray toned warm tone transition shades in
there that I've been obsessed with so
this palette has definitely been a
favorite because I've been pulling it
into my makeup look every single day so
anyway that is it guys those are my
current high end makeup favorites i hope
you enjoyed this video thank you so much
