this video I am sharing with you guys my
current high-end makeup favorites this
is going to be a collab video with my
friend Shanna cookie here on YouTube I'm
going to go ahead and link her video of
her channel and also her Instagram down
below in the description bar it will be
the first thing you see I would love if
you guys went over and told her I say
hello checked out her channel I think
she's really really wonderful she's a
very genuine person she has a kick-ass
makeup collection and she knows a lot
about what she's talking about which i
think is fantastic so I highly recommend
that you guys go over and tell her and
say hello check out her channel stick
around a little bit and also I have to
say is she is very good friends with my
idol here on YouTube
Kristin from mama loves mascara so that
makes me love her even more because
kristin is the reason I started my
youtube channel so I love her and I love
Janna as well so I hope you guys will go
over and tell her I say hello but you
know let's just get into it I'm about I
don't know two or three weeks ago I did
a video like my top 10 under 10 so that
was kind of like my current favorites
from the drugstore so now I'm gonna be
sharing with you guys some of my current
high-end makeup favorites that maybe you
haven't heard me talking about recently
so let's get started I'm going to go
ahead and start with highlighters there
are a three different kind of highlights
I don't want to say different kind of
highlights there are three different
highlighters that are high-end I've been
enjoying they are from the same sort of
color family and that is like a light
pink iridescent highlight I've been
really really into that I don't know why
I think it's because I actually do have
a cool undertone in my skin and I love a
gold highlight I always thought that
looked amazing but I have to say I have
noticed that light pink highlights if
you have fair skin and like a cool
undertone II really are very very
complimentary towards your skin tone so
I feel like these look a lot better on
my skin than a gold highlight not that
I'm gonna stop wearing gold highlights
but I feel like these kind of colors are
a lot more complimentary and I've really
been into it so the first one I want to
share with you guys is the Urban Decay
act
eight-hour powder highlighter in the
shade aura so this is what it looks like
it's a beautiful kind of pinky purple
iridescent color there is swatched and
I'm gonna swatch all of three of these
next to each other so you guys can see
we can do a little battle of the
highlighters here so here is the Urban
Decay afterglow highlighter in the shade
aura the second favorite that I've been
loving is my dior glowing garden's
illuminator in the shade is 0:01 glowing
pink this also has that kind of pinky
tone to it but it's more of a like white
undertone if that makes sense
and this one and the next one I'm going
to show you have a baked Jala formula
which I really really have been enjoying
as well and then the third one is the
laura geller baked gelato swirl
illuminator in the shade charming pink
and this one has a little more of a
pinky undertone so they are very very
similar this one again has a beit jala a
formulation to it they're beautiful on
the skin but they are different but I
just really really like this like light
pink thing that's been going on lately
I've been really really like craving
these colors on my skin I like to put
them you know down the bridge of my nose
on my cheekbones I think they're
beautiful and very very complimentary if
you do have fair skin with cool
undertones so here we have Ora then we
have a glowing pink from Dior and then
there is the laura geller baked a lot of
swirl illuminator in the shade charming
pink so they're all really really
beautiful I would say Ora has a little
more of a purpley undertone
charming pink has more of a pink and
then you can see the glowing gardens
have a little more of like an iridescent
white undertone so anyway I've been
really really into at the Beit Jala
formulation and also really really into
like pink highlighters alright moving on
the next thing I want to talk about is a
bronzer that I recently purchased that
I've really just been it's been driving
me crazy like I love it like in a good
way it's been driving me crazy in a good
way
it is the Too Faced sweethearts bronzer
in the shade sweet tea and this is what
it looks like it's beautiful it's that
kind of a cool tone over here and then a
warmer tone over here again if you have
like fair skin with a cool undertone and
you take a really fluffy brush swirl it
in here and dust it all over your face
it looks gorgeous
it's so so so beautiful I
you find that these what are these they
to face sweet words um blushes have a
little more like chunks of glitter and
grit in them than the bronzer does the
bronzer just has a really like finely
milled formulation to it and the
sparkles in there aren't really sparkles
they're more like shimmer or glimmer so
let me go ahead and swatch it here so
you guys can see it's really really
beautiful on the skin it gives a lot of
glow and I just feel like my skin is
glowing and looks very youthful when I
wear this so that has definitely been a
favorite the next favorite is actually a
little blush palette and this is no
longer available this is the benefit to
real cheeky palette real cheeky party
palette it's super super bulk horrible
packaging they leave it on the mirror I
already used up the highlights the
eyeliner and the mascara all I have left
are the bronzer and then these four
blushes here I do plan on deep plotting
these because this is like the biggest
chunky of clunkiest packaging ever but I
really have been enjoying benefit
blushes and also be hoola bronzer
because I feel like they're very very
subtle if that makes sense um
they give like a nice wash of color on
your cheeks without looking overdone
literally every single one of them hoola
is gorgeous because it's just this cool
tone matte bronzer really works on a lot
of different skin tones rocket or you
know dandelion these are all colors that
are very very beautiful and coralista is
really well-known as well these are all
just colors that are really really
gorgeous and well-known however I feel
like the reason they're so universal is
the fact that they're not overdone
they're not too bright too they're very
very subtle and they look beautiful on
the cheeks and I find that I can use
every single shade in here and have just
a nice beautiful kind of glowy cheek
going on and I really really enjoy that
so that has been a favorite the next
thing I want to talk about is the
Lancome Hypnose drama mascara I have six
deluxe sized samples of this mascara I
have yet to have had to purchase a full
size of this I get these as like
hundred-point perks once in a while and
I have six of them laying around like I
have not had to go ahead and purchase a
full size yet but this mascara is
amazing it's got a beautiful beautiful
want it has a very wet slick formula I'm
not so much like an oily formula but
more just like a wet formula so if you
don't like that you
we won't like this it's not amazing like
well the heck it smells amazing it
smells like fruit literally but it has
this tiny little bit of a curve to it I
don't know what it is but this is
beautiful on top of like eight base
mascara so you could use something like
I don't know
covergirl clump crusher and then top it
with this it looks like you have false
lashes like it is such an amazing
mascara this has quickly just become a
favourite of mine for sure alright the
next thing I want to talk about are some
primers again and these are samples
because I haven't had to go and purchase
full sizes yet because I have so many so
I actually have nine yes nine of these
little deluxe sized samples of the
Smashbox primer oil I have been really
really into these and you guys can tell
like I haven't had to purchase like I
said the full size yet I have it on my
loveless waiting and I have the lip
Lancome Hypnose drama as well waiting on
the list for when I need to get them but
this is an amazing amazing primer oil I
really enjoy it if you do have oily or
combo skin like me all you need is like
a few drops I kind of rub it between my
hands warm it up and then I Pat it into
my skin I love that it moisturizes my
skin and also prolongs the wear of my
makeup and I find that Smashbox primers
really are the best
I mean honestly like they were the first
ones to come out with the whole like
primer thing and I feel like they have
the best quality they truly do make my
makeup you know stay on my face longer
so I really like that they released this
primer oil a little goes a long way
again I haven't had to purchase the full
size yet if you can get your hands on a
little deluxe light sample I highly
recommend doing so and yeah really been
enjoying that and then the second one is
the Bobbi Brown vitamin enriched face
base I have four of these so I haven't
had to purchase a full size yet this
smells like lemon cake it's beautiful
I don't know what it is I thought that
this was going to be a very very like
moisturizing product you can see it's a
very thick it is quite humectant it
definitely like locks in moisture on the
skin but when you're rubbing it in it
almost feels like a silicone or pore
filling line
and I don't actually know if there's
Dometic own in here but it just smooths
the appearance of the skins it smells
amazing like a lemon bar oh it smells so
good but it just makes the skin feel so
nice it has a little bit of a tacky
texture which is helpful when you're
putting on your foundation because you
really want it to stick to your base I
don't know what it is I'm just in love
with this I really thought it wasn't
gonna be anything special this was one
of those products where you like type in
the code and yeah I have quite a few of
these and I really really have been
enjoying that as far as foundations are
concerned there are two here that I have
been going to very very frequently and
maybe the reason you haven't seen me
talk about them in my fails and holy
grails is because I've been using them
more as a base and then putting a
heavier foundation on top of because I
like full coverage like I'm just a full
coverage kind of girl but as of late
like the past two weeks I've been really
enjoying just wearing like a BB cream or
today I'm just wearing a tinted
moisturizer on my skin these are
basically water or serum foundations
which are so popular right now it seems
like every single brand is coming out
with a serum or water foundation but my
two favorite currently have been the
laura mercier candle glow soft luminous
foundation my shade is shell and then I
also have been loving my Stila aqua low
serum foundation and my shade is fair
and I've tried quite a few out do you
guys know I tried out think back on
before they came out with the new
lighter say it I did end up returning
that it wasn't a fan I also have tried
out the Tarte rainforest of the sea I
have like a little sample size I still
think that out of all three of those the
Stila one is the best I just love the
way this goes on and it caters to really
really fair complected girls or boys and
let me show you guys what they look like
on the skin because they're very very
similar so there we have these Stila
aqua glow and then I'll put a pump of
the Laura Mercier right next to it so
Cielo aqua glow Laura Mercier you can
see that the Stila aqua glow definitely
has a little more it's a little more
watery but I will say that the coverage
builds up on it a little better so here
we have the Laura Mercier one this one
is beautiful because it has like light
reflecting particles in it that really
make the skin look kind
like you know it's kind of reminds me of
like the hourglass ambient lighting
powders like it just gives that sort of
like lit-from-within sort of base and
then here is the Stila
aqua glow I will say the laura mercier
looks better with just like one even
layer over the face whereas the Stila
aqua glow actually builds really
beautifully on the skin like you can get
a nice medium coverage with that product
so I really really like both of those
again I have tried out so many like
serum or water foundations they also
really like the Sephora ethereal natural
finish one I enjoy these Smashbox the BB
water drops I enjoy a lot of them but
these two have definitely been something
that I have been reaching for lately
currently I like just wearing these on
their own but a couple months ago or
yeah I would say it for like the past
two months I have been wearing these and
then going in with a heavier coverage
foundation on top I know that sounds
like a lot of foundations but I like to
take my face and it just makes them look
really beautiful because these are a
nice base product alright moving on the
next two products that I've been
enjoying are my little tart clay pots
these are so fun so you can use these as
eyeliner or you can use them as cream
eyeshadow if I could open them but this
shade right here is called rose gold
it's beautiful these are just really
really nice because like they said they
kind of are like a two in one product
that you can use as eyeliner if you know
how to do winged eyeliner I can't do
winged eyeliner for but if you know
how to do winged eyeliner you can use
these for winged eyeliner I like to put
them on my lower lash line you can take
it and put it all over like your eye as
a basically a cream eyeshadow they're
very very opaque and beautiful and
creamy and blendable and I just really
really enjoy these and I do want to pick
up a few more colors I saw that they are
releasing some really really fun kind of
vibrant shades so I'm very excited about
that
so yeah I have those in rose gold and
mint and then let's talk about some
lippies that I have been enjoying I've
really been enjoying the Clinique chubby
sticks so these are basically
moisturizing balms they have three
different kinds so you have the baby
tint which is like a barely there sort
of tint the shader have is pop and poppy
you have the chubby stick intense which
is like obviously a little more of an
intense color this one is in Mightiest
maraschino maraschino
you know Marcy no how do you say that
little Marcy no cherries you know you
guys know what I'm talking about
anyway that's that shade and then the
last one is called curvy candy which is
a beautiful pink color I'm gonna go
ahead and try and swatch these this one
is a little poppin papi your bear
you're basically barely going to see
like you I don't know if you can see
that but anyway it's like a barely there
sort of tint but I've been carrying
these around in my purse because they're
very very comfortable to wear on my lips
and these actually don't rub off on my
sleep head joint so I can practice with
them on so I carried this one into my
flute in my little flute bag and then I
carry these two in my purse I really
really enjoy these and I've been using
these like non-stop for the past two
months so there we have Kirby candy
which is just the original formula the
cherry one in the middle that's the
intense formula and then the pop in pop
er whenever right there were you guys
probably can't even see it but they're
very very comfortable to wear on the
lips they're one of those like products
that you just don't have to think about
they're kind of like baby lips you can
just put them on without a mirror
they're very very easy to use I really
really enjoy them alright let's talk a
little bit about some eyeliners I've
been enjoying these Lancome
what are these drama liquid pencils in
um Poulet
and Coco sua so these are the two shades
I have on play is the purple and then
Kazu is the blue one I really really
enjoy these like they're so beautiful
they're very reminiscent of the Urban
Decay 24/7 glide-on eye pencils but I
feel like these colors really pop like
if you want to put them on the waterline
they really pop they wear an incredibly
long time and I'm just really into this
formula I don't know what it is so the
purple one on Poulet has a little bit of
glitter in it and then coat su off is
pretty much kind of like a satiny matte
color look at my shitty swatches I'm
living in the view my dream like really
girl
I cannot swatch to save my life I
believe it on my left hand at this
anyway so there we have our boule and
there's coat Azua they're really
beautiful they wear an incredibly long
time I think they're gorgeous on the
waterline I find I really liked the
Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on eye pencil I
talked about those all the time as you
guys know however I find that
of their like darker purples or blues
don't really pop on my waterline like I
have to use a really really like bright
one to really get that look on my
waterline of like boom there's color
right there I find that some of their
jewel tones like shades just don't
really look like anything they look kind
of muddled and muddy on my waterline so
I really like these ones from Lancome
alright moving on let's talk about
something that I have talked about
non-stop and you guys are probably gonna
roll your eyes when I say it but I have
to include them my urban discrete and
Urban Decay Urban Decay color correcting
fluids i'm cest you guys I'm obsessed
with these I talk about them all the
time but these have just been an
obsession for literally like the past
three months we have the green shade
these are the Naked skin like I said
color correcting fluids we have the pink
one the yellow one the lavender at the
peach I've used them all it's the same
thing but you can basically they're like
a multitasking sort of products like if
you have fair skin and you want to
brighten underneath your eye area and
you also want to like cover up
hyperpigmentation you can get the pink
shade if you're not wearing a yellow
undertone but you're still fair you can
use the yellow one if you just have
redness on your face use the green one
if you have like aging skin and lots of
fine lines and wrinkles use the purple
one to fill them in and if you have like
medium to deep skin tones you want to UM
fill in if you want to cover up dark
circles and hyperpigmentation you can
get the peach one they're amazing
they're extremely creamy and blendable I
just can't I can't even
I love the applicator I love the
formulation I'm obsessed with everything
about these so there is the peach one on
the back of my hand I know I talk about
these all the time but I have to believe
them because they're always favorites
alright and then the last thing I want
to talk about is something that I never
talk about I actually did a review on
this product and I kind of was like it's
just okay I believe this is on sale
right now so highly recommend if you do
have fair skin and you're looking for a
pallet filled with transition colors I
have been reaching for this for probably
the past three months for a transition
shade every single day and I have been
using like pellets that have nice
in colors but there's something about
the lorac new necessities palette that
just like has my name written all over
it you get so many gorgeous matte shades
in here that are great for transition
you know transition colors in your
crease I mean you have cool tones warm
tones again if you have like medium to
deep skin tones I don't think a half of
these would even show up on you and I
stated that in my review of this product
I thought that it didn't really cater to
everybody but there are just so many
gorgeous like light like Asia and like
gray toned warm toned transition shades
in there that I've been obsessed with so
this palette has definitely been a
favorite because I've been pulling it
into my makeup look every single day so
anyway that is it guys those are my
current high-end makeup favorites I hope
you enjoyed this video thank you so much
