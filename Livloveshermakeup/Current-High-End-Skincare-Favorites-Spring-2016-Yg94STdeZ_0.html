channel happy Saturday I hope you were
all having a fantastic weekend so far so
today's video is completely different
than what I was going to be doing or
what I should have done let me tell you
guys what happened so normally I have
this little book where I write out all
my YouTube ideas for the whole month so
I have a different video for each month
I wake up in the morning I put on my
makeup and then I go and open up my book
I see which video I'm filming I sit down
and I film a well if you guys didn't
know about two weeks ago I started a new
series on my channel called the look of
the week which is where I sit down and
do my makeup with you guys them go to
look that I've been wearing that week
and I was supposed to do that today but
I woke up I put on my makeup and like
going open my book and it's like look of
the week and I'm like okay but I just
put my makeup on so anyways I did not
feel like just taking off my makeup just
to redo it on camera I'm just not that
kind of person it's not gonna do that
that's like a you know extra work that
just doesn't need to be done especially
on the weekend I just want to relax so
anyway I did pull a different idea out
of the long list of ideas that I have a
lot of them are from you guys this
actually if you're a requested video and
this is my current high-end skincare
favorites video so I'm sharing with you
guys current high-end skincare products
that I have been loving and I think it
was meant to be that I did not film the
look of the week today because actually
this morning I put on my really really
fast makeup that I do when either I
don't want to put on a lot of makeup or
I have to be out in a hurry and I think
it was just meant to be that look at the
week which was not meant to happen this
week so anyway I apologize about that I
will be back with look of the week next
week I think because it is a new series
to me I just haven't been able to really
like get the ball rolling on it because
two weeks ago I did it and then I was
sick last weekend and then this week and
I forgot so next weekend it will happen
anyway let's go ahead and talk about
some of my current high-end skincare
favorites shall we
so the first favorite I want to talk
about is something that I've used on my
neck and you actually can use this all
over your body this is the polished
choice resist retinol skin smoothing
body treatment it's for all skin types
that has antioxidants in it and it has
retinol so it helps to hydrate and
repair it create smoother younger
looking skin and it builds collagen for
firmer skin
I love the Paula's Choice brand I think
they have some really really good skin
care products that are free of really
really harsh chemicals and also free of
any sort of I don't want to say like
just just fragrances they don't have a
lot of things that are going to irritate
your skin so anyway this is basically
just a retinol treatment but it's for
your body so you can use this on the
back of your hands you can use this
basically wherever you want and I find
that I've use it on my neck at nighttime
and it's really really nice it sinks in
really really quickly it's and I
obviously want to make sure that my neck
doesn't start falling or you know just
like lose the elasticity and things like
that because I've said this before on my
channel but the number one thing that I
can like when I look at someone the
number one thing that kind of gives away
their age is always their neck if you
don't take good care of your neck it's
kind of like a sign of oh that person
took really good care of you know the
skin on their face but not their neck
and you can instantly kind of see their
age so anyway I think that it's really
important to take care of your neck and
I try and always use this at nighttime I
use it in upward motion so that I'm not
pulling down like gravity you know what
I mean I'm pushing up and I use it on
the back of my hands and just go up like
that any excess that I have I just rub
into you know the back of my hands as
well and I really do like this product
it's a very very nice alright they said
an item that I have been loving my
boyfriend I also had been enjoying is
the pharmacy sleep tight firming at
night balm so we have a little deluxe
sized sample here and then a full-size
right here this is a really really nice
product
it's a gel-in-oil so this is what it
looks like it actually looks like a gel
and then when you rub it in on your skin
it turns into an oil so it's actually a
really cool product the gel makes it
seem very very lightweight but then you
are getting those wonderful benefits of
the oil in there and it's not like
echinacea I think that's homemade
echinacea
echinacea I can eat shots I think it's
echinacea anyways
like that so sometimes sort of used
around my nose area I feel like it's
helping with my sinuses anyway it's
really really lovely and it says that
it's an innovative renewing night
treatment it's ultra light balm
transforms into a gentle oil gel so it's
very very lightweight on the skin it
definitely doesn't leave me with any
sort of skin irritations or breakouts
and I just like what it does for my skin
overnight I always wake up and my skin
looks a little more refined and just
fresher and a lot nicer so I have been
enjoyed that a lot recently the next
item I have been enjoying is this
particular mask you guys know I have a
huge mass collection but the Peter
Thomas Roth cucumber gel mask has been a
favorite of mine for the past couple of
weeks as you guys can probably tell I'm
almost out of this little guy but I've
been enjoying this because I have been
in a lupus flare up last week in kind of
the week before anything that I put on
my skin needs to be soothing and cooling
and nice because I got a lot of rashes
that get melasma I get to just textured
that just comes out of nowhere and 95%
of the time it disappears when my
flare-up goes away but sometimes it's if
it stays there a nice scar a little bit
so this is really really nice when I do
have my flare-ups and I don't want to be
scratching and itching at my skin
because of course if I start itching and
scratch and I am going through scars so
this is really nice it's very
lightweight on the skin it feels very
very cooling it has cucumber and all
these soothing ingredients in there I
really really love it and it says Elsa
refreshes and moisturizes and is just
extremely calling so I enjoyed this a
lot and I definitely recommend popping
this in the refrigerator before you use
it it just feels and that much better
alright and the next item I have really
been enjoying is the Kate Somerville
derma quench a liquid lift so this is a
retinol treatment I love using retinol
treatments at night I'm then going in
with some sort of a moisturizer if I
need to but this is an advanced
resurfacing treatment I believe there's
also a little bit of glycolic acid in
here I won't be doing a whole video
dedicated to retinol because I've gotten
a lot of questions from you guys asking
about you know can I mix retinol with
certain ingredients certain products and
you definitely can mix retinol and
glycolic acid together but you can't
really mix like salicylic acid and
retinol or benzoyl peroxide and retinol
take
there they actually bounced against each
other and then one of them will
basically deactivate it and you only
have one on the skin so there is a rule
with retinol on what you can use I
believe there is a little bit of
glycolic acid in here and then there
also is the retinol so I'll go into all
of that when I do my retinol video but
anyway this is a really nice product it
comes out like a foam it sinks in
immediately sometimes retinol treatments
can be a little greasy on the skin or
they can feel it like they're kind of
weighing down your skin I never feel
like this does that I just realized I
think I have a little mascara blobs on
my eyes I was looking in the mirror I
saw like little you know how they get
like dried underneath I didn't go in
with my q-tip anyway I'm not gonna look
at the viewfinder okay but anyway this
is a really nice product it sinks in
really really quickly it's just got a
wonderful consistency to it it is unlike
any sort of retinol treatment I've ever
used so I do really enjoy this from Kate
Somerville and the next item I have been
enjoying is the new glam glow glow
starter mega illuminating moisturizer I
did a review on this product recently I
loved it I'm a huge fan of glam glow I'm
very picky with my skincare but I have
never been let down by glam glow so this
is what it looks like it is a beautiful
iridescent sort of moisturizer and
moisturizer is just the right way
especially if you do have oily or combo
skin I feel like it puts just the right
amount of moisture in there but it also
gives you the most gorgeous glow and
Sheen to your skin I did do a review but
I have not done any demo yet I plan on
doing a demo and also a video showing
you guys what are my favourite products
for a glowy skin that will be coming up
in the next week or two so stay tuned
for that but this is just beautiful this
shade is called nude glow this is the
only one that they have currently and
even on my super super fair skin it
still looks really really nice it
doesn't put tons of light color it
doesn't deposit a bunch of color into
your face it just has a book gorgeous
sort of illuminating finish to it so
I've been enjoying that a lot I really
love that let's talk about an oil that
I've been crazy about I feel like I
talked about this a lot of my channel
but that's because it's so good this is
the Korres or Korres Wild Rose advanced
a vitamin C brightening oil so a lot of
people think this is a serum it's not a
theorem it is definitely a treatment oil
and it's a lovely if you do have combo
or oily skin it has
such a thin consistency to it you
literally can put like a full dropper
full of this on to your skin Pat it in
on top of your moisturizer or just on to
your skin it helps with
hyperpigmentation it has helps so much
so much with the hyperpigmentation that
I have on my jawline I don't know if you
guys can tell sometimes when I am on
camera when I have no makeup on
sometimes you know I think like back in
the day maybe about four or five months
ago you could really see the little
areas where I had some hyperpigmentation
I feel like this particular product has
me that's so much less noticeable I like
to wear this during the day you can also
wear it at nighttime but it's a
wonderful lightweight oil it helps with
hyperpigmentation it moisturizes your
skin but it does not leave your skin
oily so if you do have combo or oily
skin and you really want to try and oil
out I would highly recommend checking
out this one from Korres really really
love this the next item I have been
enjoying is this little eye cream it's
almost up with this I'm almost up with
it almost done with it you guys might
see it in my May empties but this is the
codleyn the punya clue this is the eye
cream it is so lovely I love the
consistency of this it reminds me one of
my all-time favorite eye creams which is
the yes to grapefruit dark circle
correcting eye cream I love that the
consistency is just like you tap it in
and it's it sinks in completely this is
the same sort of thing I've used this in
the morning and at nighttime and I
really have been noticing that my bags
don't look as puffy in the morning and
especially underneath my IV do you have
the beginnings of fine lines because
well I smile a lot that's what I like to
think they're from but anyway I have
noticed that they just seem a lot less
like noticeable and my skin underneath
my eyes is just a lot smoother so I
really like this and if you are someone
who tends to get Melia or Mia those
little tiny bumps underneath your eyes
from using two humectant or two
moisturizing of a product I highly
recommend checking this out because it
is so lightweight all right and then the
last little thing I want to talk about
is a little kit um this is the Peter
Thomas Roth unwrinkle kit I have been
using this at nighttime all of these
products um my ride-or-die are these
Peter Thomas Roth
wrinkle peel pads these are amazing if
you have congested skin if you have dry
skin if you have any sort of skin type
except for sensitive you would enjoy
these they really help to unclog your
pores basically you rub it on your face
you leave it on for about 60 seconds to
3 minutes depending on your skin type
and then you wash it off it's amazing
and then you go in with the unwrinkled
turbo line smoothing toning lotion and
this is so cool it reminds me a lot of
the polished choice what is it called
advanced smoothing toner I believe it's
called it's very moisturizing it feels
really really nice again if you have
sensitive skin you should probably stay
away from this line they have a
combination of retinol and glycolic acid
in there and those can be quite
irritating on the skin but this is a
beautiful beautiful toning lotion I've
been using the set night time really
love that I let that sink in and then
I've been going in with the unwrinkle
turbo face serum I love the consistency
on this I am one of those people
normally when I wear a serum in the
morning I want it to sink in like
lightning fast like super super fast but
this one definitely has a lot of
moisture to it and it's really really
nice at night time especially after
you've kind of scrubbed your face to get
all your makeup off and your skin might
be left feeling a little tight this
really puts moisture back in and then
you follow up with the last product
which is the unwrinkle night cream a
little goes a long way with this baby if
you have oily or combo skin use the
smallest amount it's just a really
really light pale yellow color and it's
beautiful so excuse me I really really
like this line I think it's very nice
for like preventative sort of measures I
had one of my subscribers asked me why I
use so many products that are meant for
more like mature skin and its really
just to help my skin to make sure that
it stays the younger looking if that
makes sense I'll be 24 in about two
months so I just want to make sure that
my skin it looks nice and fresh and yeah
so anyway really enjoyed that line
highly recommend if you do have dry skin
as well and yeah those are my current
high end favorite skin care items I hope
you guys enjoyed this video sorry about
look of the week we'll be back with that
next Saturday and I'll see you guys
tomorrow from my face and Halle rails
