thank you so much for joining me today
it's video is going to be my December
2016 empties I actually don't have too
much to share with you guys because I am
pre filming this on December 10th if you
guys didn't know I leave next week to go
out of town for to almost two and a half
weeks I am visiting my parents in
Minnesota so you guys won't be seeing
this video until the end of the month I
will be gone when you're watching it but
I wanted to go ahead and get a pre film
so I could still get it up for you guys
so I do have quite a lot of empties for
10 days which is kind of crazy so next
month I probably will have a two-part
empties video just so that I can really
sit down and give you guys on my
thoughts on the products instead of
feeling like I have to rush through it
because I go through a lot of so
anyway let's go ahead and jump right
into it and then first empty I used up
this month with the ultra moisturizing
and brightening Sephora Rose cleansing
wipes this is probably no surprise to a
lot of you and there are 25 different
wipes in here for both face and also
eyes and I just think this is really
really wonderful they are some of my
all-time favorite facial wipes as of
right now they take off makeup really
nicely I don't really recommend using
them around your eye area I've talked
about that before but for removing face
makeup they're great and also I will say
that they are really nice if we're going
ahead and just like taking off residual
skin care in the morning so I love those
and I would repurchase I did use up the
philosophy purity made a simple facial
cleansing gel and eye makeup remover and
this is not the original one the
original one is kind of like a creamy
milky cleanser and this is an item I
would repurchase I don't like the
original one on my face for removing
makeup I use that for cleaning my
sponges and brushes however this one the
facial cleansing gel and eye makeup
remover is great for taking off makeup
the only thing I don't like is that you
do have to put water on your face before
you go in with this but it really does
remove eye makeup well and also a face
makeup and you do get 7.5 fluid ounces
of product in here which is a lot so I
would repurchase that let's see here I
did use up the Shea Moisture raw shea
butter moisture retention shampoo and
this has seek help and argan oil for dry
damaged hair so one of my friends at
work who is a woman of color she
recommended I tried this out I was
having a lot of well I still am I'm kind
of having some issues from scalp and
damage after some lupus flare ups and
she said that this is very very nice on
the scalp but nice on the hair
and I agree completely it's absolutely
beautiful so I would definitely go ahead
and repurchase that however I do notice
it does weigh down my hair kind of a
little bit so I like to mix it together
with other shampoos but it is very good
alright I did use a tub of the Peter
Thomas Roth unwrinkled peel pads this is
a 20% acid complex of glycolic salicylic
and also electic acids these are amazing
I love these you do get let's see here
60 pads in here and they each have 0.7
ounces of product in them or on them so
basically what you do is you cleanse
your face and then you apply one of
these all over you can apply it to your
neck the back of your hands wherever you
might have some hyperpigmentation or
fine lines and wrinkles it definitely it
clears up acne and all that kind of
stuff very very nicely as well and then
you do it rinse it after about 60
seconds to 3 minutes depending on your
skin type so I leave it on for about 60
seconds because right now I'm a little
more on the dry side but during the
summer time I do leave it on for 30
minutes and then like I said you
neutralize the peel with water so I love
these I've been using these for years
since I was in college and I cannot live
without them so would repurchase let's
see here I just have another little
package of these Sephora rose cleansing
wipes like I said these are absolutely
amazing and smell incredible so I would
repurchase I did use up a little duo
pack from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works these are
the wallflowers home fragrance refills
in the scent of this they shade in the
scent of cinnamon sticks so I have these
right now going in the Beauty room this
scent is incredible I don't know why I
never purchased this before I think
because I really thought it would
literally just smell like cinnamon but
it doesn't it smells like cinnamon and
like wood zenus and like a fireside it's
very very cozy love this will repurchase
let's see here I did use up in the glam
glow use my tingle exfoliating treatment
I believe this is yeah this is the
full-size so this is really really nice
especially if you do have more dry or
mature skin it does work very well if
you also have oily skin I would stay
away if you do have very sensitive skin
it has a very strong like green tea sort
of scent yeah smells like tea and
honestly does dried down a lot and it
does tingle on the face so I wouldn't
recommend it for everyone but I love it
I love all of the glam glow mass so this
is a really really good one all right I
didn't use up a little tub of the downy
UNSTOPABLES
in wash scent boosters in these spring
scents so I used to love using these
kind of products in my wash but ever
since I bought mr. badger
who is my pet ferret I've had him for
about three months now I stopped using
these and I started again about a week
ago and he started getting like eye
contact dermatitis sort of rash so he
just can't handle the fragrance when I
hold him when I'm wearing this kind of
stuff that has been washed in this so I
will not be repurchasing this but this
particular downy unstoppable brand is
actually really really good they make
your wash smell very yummy you basically
just take a capsule of the little beads
you toss them in with your wash and they
completely dissipate and disintegrate
into your actual clothing so it smells
really good I did like this spring scent
but the best one is the purple scent
which is called a lush alright moving on
I did use up a let's see here or we
burnt through a candle this is black
cherry Merlot this is a three wood
candle from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works with a
rose gold lid I love that the fragrance
notes in here are dark cherry black
raspberry and scrumptious Merlot I do
think it smells better in hand soap
variation like deep cleansing soap and
variation but it still smells amazing
really really like this one of my
favorite favorite favorite you know
cents for the winter time by the way we
did go through a two of those if you are
curious I do have some little items that
are stuck in that candle let's see here
we have the belief the true cream aqua
balm and Tom used this up it's just a
little sample of the gel moisturizer he
really likes this I really like this
it's beautiful would repurchase let's
see here we have the Peter Thomas Roth
Irish more mud purifying black mask
I have already purchased this in a
full-size let's see here this is
purifying refining decongestant and
hydrating and I really do think it is
especially if you do have more combo to
oily skin and you want a mask that's not
gonna dry down on the skin this doesn't
slowly dry down but you want something
to decongest your pores this is great so
obviously I like I said I already
purchased and would repurchase let's see
here we did use up a Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
holiday traditions deep cleansing hand
soup in the shed deep blending hands up
and they send a winter candy apple this
is what it looks like the fragrance
notes in here are let's see here festive
red apple evergreen wreath and brown
sugar cider so all I really smell in
here is like freshness and apple and I
don't know what it is I keep saying like
this is a nice scent but it's not my
favorite scent however I got it in like
hand sanitizer form and I got a bunch of
different like deep cleansing hand soaps
and I chose to use this one first and
that hand sanitizer first so I think I
subconsciously and really really in love
with the scent
that is just very very fresh and reminds
me of what is it I think it reminds me
of a Victoria's Secret endless love
Body Wash if you've ever tried that it
smells a lot like that so anyway really
do enjoy that I did use up the good
jeans all-in-one lactic acid treatment
to thus brightens exfoliates plums lines
and evens hyper pigmentation in the skin
this is not a full-size this is the one
that I got in the power couple do with
the luna night oil so you go through
this a lot quicker than you do the luna
night oil I just wanted to put that out
there but it is absolutely beautiful
a really really good treatment like I
said it has lactic acid in it just kind
of like the Peter Thomas Roth unwrinkled
peel pads very very good for your skin
too guess I would repurchase I did use
up a perfume which is crazy because I
don't know I can't remember the last
time I used up a perfume but this is the
Pacifica Persian rose perfume now this
is something that I bought probably
about a month and a half ago so the fact
that I've already used it up or really
shows that I love it I think it smells
really nice paired together with the
Elizabeth and James to Nirvana bourbon
perfume and that's mostly what I was
wearing it for this during like the fall
and holiday season but yeah it smells
amazing really do like that would
repurchase let's see here I did go
through a body scrub this is from tree
hatchet this is the Shay sugar scrub in
the tropical mango scent so you do get
quite a nice amount of product in here
18 ounces or 510 grams it smells amazing
you guys know I love the tree house
shake sugar scrubs I definitely
preferred these sugar scrubs over there
salt scrubs they're salt scrubs are also
really nice but the sugar ones are the
best
and this particular scent is absolutely
amazing and it's my all-time favorite
they have a lot of sweet ones and they
have ones that are nicer for the winter
time as well they're a little more
mellow and scent but they're all very
very good and scrub up and nicely
without leaving you i'li so I would
repurchase I did use up two sheet masks
the first one is from secret garden this
is the olive oil on pool or on Pralay
mask so in here you are getting a sheet
mask and then you put on this serum
first so I love the sheet mask the only
thing I don't really like is the fact
that it does kind of smell like alcohol
and that makes me wonder how hydrating
it can breathe how hydrating it can
actually be if it is laced with alcohol
but this is really beautiful it's
supposed to deeply hydrate the skin and
moisturize and firm and I just love the
way that the actual mass fits in my face
because it's like a gel consistency so I
really like that would repurchase
and then I did use up a Sephora Rose
face mask so I although I love the Rose
line I will say I'm not a huge fan of
their sheet masks I feel like they kind
of don't conform to my face they don't
really fit very well so I probably
wouldn't repurchase but I do feel like
if the actual formulation of the mask
has gotten better let's see here and the
last item that I used up you guys with
another little duo pack from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works of wallflowers this is sparkling
icicles and we currently have this in
the living room it smells amazing if you
are really into those more like sexy
scents that are kind of like manly like
mahogany teak wood mahogany balsam and
also what else am I thinking of oh yes
New York black-tie the candle I have
behind me then I think you would really
really like this set so anyway guys that
is it for my December 2016 empties I
hope you enjoyed this video thank you so
much for joining me and I will see you
in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
