channel I hope you are all having a
wonderful day today's video is going to
be my december 2016 unboxings now this
is a pre filmed video so not every
single one of my subscription boxes came
in already so basically the only three
that I'm sharing with you in this video
are boxy charm GlossyBox and outs of
ypsi so I haven't gotten my sephora play
yet i haven't gotten my nature box
there's quite a few that I haven't got I
did however receive the fab fit fun
winter box but I'm going to go ahead and
unbox that when i do my honest PR
reviews and video number three which
will be up at the beginning of january
when i get back from my trip so that's
why I just jump right into it I will
start with it see and this is what the
little pouch looks like this month so
it's really really cute I like the color
the actual consistency kind of freaks me
out I don't know why it's one of those
like what is it called eyelash knit or
whatever it is like consistencies I
don't really like that but the first
thing that I got in my Ipsy glam bag is
from ren skincare this is the glycolic
lactic radiance renewal mass so i love
anything with lactic acids and glycolic
acid so i think that i am going to like
this it says to apply for 10 minutes and
then wipe off with a damp washcloth the
next item that I got is a knicks single
this is in the shade a jaded which is
really really beautiful kind of like a
grayish dirty green color I think that
looks gorgeous I don't know if I would
really use this color so I'm probably
going to go ahead and declutter that but
I feel like that happens a lot with my
tipsy bag alright moving on I have a
ciate london liquid velvet lipstick this
is what it looks like the shade is
really pretty but again i don't really
wear liquid lipstick the shade is called
pinup so i'm probably going to declutter
that as well but the next item that i
have here looks like it is a skincare
item which is awesome this is a snow
cream moisturizer and this is from oh my
god this is so cool this is from the
brand symphony beauty and it literally
is like this bouncy gel do you guys see
that oh I'm excited for that I always
get very excited when if she does send
me skincare because not only am I into
makeup i'm into skincare i know i say
that every single month but i mean it
alright the next item i have here is
from Tarte and this is the mark kousha l
that is so exciting i love the tarte
maracuja oil this is perfect um first
travel basically this is just one of the
little mini buns and this is a really
beautiful thick luxurious oil so again
be happy they sent me some skin care
products this month so I would say if
she got probably two out of five stars
I'm not into some of the makeup items
that they sent me but if these skincare
items look pretty darn in Coweta alright
let's go ahead and move on to a boxy
charm so here is as a boxy charm box for
the month i have already opened it but i
haven't peeked inside so let's take a
look at what we have here here is the
little card and the first item that I
see here is an over a long lasting
liquid lipstick now funny story I know I
just said that I don't like liquid
lipsticks but I do like the ofra
formulation it's very nice it's like a
whipped moose kind of formulation and
it's very very comfortable on the lip so
this is a gorgeous gorgeous color the
shade is called Napa Valley and it's
like a deep purple let's go ahead and do
a little swatch arooo and you guys will
be able to see what i mean by the actual
formula it's like a moose beautiful so
super excited for that that is a full
size which is awesome we also have the
makeup eraser it says removes your
makeup with just water this is one of
the mini versions it's funny because I
think all the brand's work together and
they go through all the different
subscription boxes because I got this
last month in my popsugar must have box
it's great it's basically just lean mini
version of the makeup eraser and it
really does take off makeup nicely
especially around the eye area so I'm
excited for that I also got the iby
beauty blush um what is this lip liner
that is what it looks like it's actually
really really nice shade Oh a little on
the dry side for my taste but that is
what the shade looks like i may or may
not declutter that we shall see the next
item I half-year looks like it is a
palette which is very exciting we have
been getting a lot of pallets lately
from you know from I was gonna say boxy
charm yes it is boxy charm excuse big
glossy backs for a boxy charm so this is
the buff collection from cure cosmetics
does this not remind you of the Urban
Decay Naked 3 palette I feel like this
is literally going to be a dupe for the
naked 3 palette so this is what the buff
collection looks like and we open it up
and yeah this is pretty much supposed to
be probably a dupe for the naked 3
palette so that will be interesting i
will definitely keep you guys updated on
that if you didn't know i did not like
they make it three pilots from urban
decay i actually decluttered it i'm just
not
to the naked formulation I don't know
why it was a little chunky a little hard
to work with not my favorite all right
and finally the last item I got is from
butter london which i really do like
butter london nail polishes and this is
in the shade ruby marie so that is what
it looks like our weight Ruby Bray so
that is what it looks like really really
deep kind of purply color kind of almost
matches that liquid lipsticks oh yeah
that is very exciting i would definitely
give bostitch arm four out of five stars
this month I think that is a good box
now let's go ahead and open my favorite
you guys know I love glossy box and the
box this month is adorable and very very
festive so let's take a peek at what we
got here so here is the little catalog
again it's in a very sparkly purpley
blue thing let's take a look alright so
the first item that I see here is from
oh my gosh pop electric a baby this is
an eau de parfum spray and it looks like
it's like a full-sized this is crazy
alrighty oh my god that is so cute look
at this it says hora zuku lovers a
fragrance oh my god that is so cute that
is like a little collector's item I'm
not gonna open it up but i will leave a
comment down below and let you guys know
if I like the fragrance but yeah that is
so cute it's basically like almost like
a Hello Kitty kind of things super super
adorable love that you see that look at
the little perfume bottle adorable I
will leave a comment down below Lane you
guys know if I like that or not but we
also have the MDM flow this is a
lipstick in a very very pretty grayish
pink color this actually reminds me of
lime crimes cashmere but actually when
you swatch it it looks a little more
peachy but in the packaging it looks a
little more cool tone but you guys see
that really pretty it actually goes on
quite nicely it's a little bit of a
thinner consistency which I like I like
a very very comfortable lipstick so I
will definitely keep that and fold on to
that we also have the the rush poze this
is the total rain what is this called
creme mousse so this is a moisturizer
for your face again you can never have
enough moisturizer especially during the
wintertime so yeah purifying a foam
cream so maybe this is actually a
cleanser let's see here it doesn't
actually say on here what he sees oh yes
purifying foam cream for combination to
oily intolerant skin while i do have
intolerant skin so i will definitely try
that out i also have a what is this beat
blues oyster gold is this a glitter it
looks like it's a cream eyeshadow this
is in a really really pretty kind of
goldish gray a shade i'm not going to
open it up because i'm not quite sure if
i would keep this particular color but
that is really beautiful and then the
last item or the second to last item i
got was another one of the purifying
foam cream for combination to intolerant
skin i don't know if this is like a duo
of a cleanser and also a moisturizer if
i just got to by accident and finally i
got Alexi brush and this is what it
looks like really really cute this is a
231 small tapered blending brush so I'm
very excited you guys know that
GlossyBox is my all-time favorite
subscription so I would definitely say
four out of five stars for that box this
month so anyway those are my unboxings
for the month I hope you enjoyed this
video thank you so much for joining me
guys and I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
