my channel happy Tuesday today I'm
sharing with you guys a video all about
some I'm not gonna back but this is
an anti call it is my December 2017 anti
haul I will have my makeup wish list for
December 2017 and going up on I believe
Saturday but yeah I'm really excited to
share with you guys the products that I
will absolutely not be purchasing I have
four of them that I definitely have set
a know on I have set my standards and
the standards are know does that make
sense if I could make sense so anyway
let's go ahead and just jump right into
a guys I want to start with a brand new
violet Vasa pallets this is called and
the hashtag pallet which I think it's
just kind of funny I really don't like
all these names that like a viola boss
does I understand that they're trying to
stay on trend and they're trying to do
the trendy thing but a hashtag that just
kind of sounds kind of dumb to me so
anyway as you guys can see this will be
available mid-december
um you get one row of Purple's at the
bottom and then all of the other ru
shadows really look like things that you
would already find in a viola bas
College I feel like viola boss almost
overdid themselves because they come out
with these beautiful palettes um but a
lot of them look very similar I think
their first three pallets were amazing
then they came out with the ride-or-die
palette which has practically every
single finish as well as color
in it so what are you supposed to do
after that you know they came up with
the taupe and not palette which is
extremely boring compared to their other
palettes but because they already did
this big rainbow palette with all these
finishes and colors are kind of like
well what do we come out with now I feel
like this palette looks incredibly a
boring I mean it just has the same sort
of warm tones on the top and then one
row of purples on the bottom it would've
been so nice if they just did an all
purple and pink palette like that would
have been a little more enticing than
this is okay so absolutely not going to
purchase this I don't think you need it
I don't think I need it especially if
you have other buy Lovaas palettes in
your collection this is gonna be an hour
all righty guys moving on to cover FX
they are releasing a new kind of shimmer
eyeshadow that will be on my makeup wish
list in Saturday's video but they are
also releasing something called the
costume cover and glitter drops I can't
I can't
I didn't think this was real I kind of
thought it was a joke listen I don't
know who
wants to have a glitter like on their
cheekbones I don't and I know there are
people out there so if you are one of
the people please tell me down below
first of all that you want to have
glitter on your cheeks and second of all
tell me why you want to have glitter on
your cheeks I promise I'm not judging
I'm just very curious because for me as
someone who is 25 years old and I mean I
take good care of my skin but let me
tell you the second glitter hits this
area right here I look like I'm in my
30s or 40s I'm not even kidding
I feel like glitter really emphasizes
pores and texture and fine lines and
wrinkles and I just don't really
understand what these are for I think
cover of X is getting a little good
Nikki here because they know their
custom enhancer drops are
brilliant okay those are beautiful they
have a nice soft Sheen to them no
glitter whatsoever in the drops and I
think that they're getting a little
money-hungry here they are releasing
three different shades but I don't know
how these are gonna sell you know you
may like these if you're maybe younger
and like your skin isn't very texture
yet or things like that but at the same
time you know these are in the $30 range
like who's gonna be buying these if
you're 16 years old it's possible maybe
you will be but for me I sure as hell
didn't have that kind of money when I
was 16 years old so anyway this is
definitely gonna be a no for me as well
please let me know if you're gonna pick
this up but for me ya know let's go
ahead and move onto the new of face and
i--i brushes from Kylie cosmetics now
you guys know I am NOT a supporter or a
fan of the Kardashians in any way shape
or form I'm really not I try not to talk
about Kylie cosmetics too much because
there are just perd brands that I won't
purchase from one of them being jeffree
star cosmetics one of them being Kylie
cosmetics I don't want to continue to
like beat the dead horse and just you
know continue to talk about those
products in anti hauls but I got so many
tags in this particular post so I
thought I would let you guys know what
my thoughts are absolutely not going to
purchase it this is over $300 you do get
quite a nice a variety of different face
and eye brushes here but I feel like the
overall vibe is just kind of cheap book
and to be completely honest I know the
Pharos are supposed to be nice and heavy
and weighted but they look cheap to me
the whole silver thing also I feel like
a lot of the brushes look like to have
uneven hairs to them and they almost
look slightly Scratchy
of course I don't know that I even tried
them I haven't touch them I
don't know how scratchy they are but
these don't look appealing to me then
think about Kylie cosmetics is that I
don't consider you to be a luxury brand
I do not consider Kylie cosmetics a
luxury brand or even really like a high
high
and brand you guys know what I'm saying
I get very very basic vibes from the
brand as a whole and I don't understand
why you chose to go with natural hair
two brushes for your first brush a
bundle that just seems a little
excessive to me especially with the
price point and especially considered
you're not a luxury brand usually if you
want to start like including brushes in
your collection you would start with
synthetic bristle brushes ones that you
don't have to buy in a bundle ones you
can purchase separately ones that don't
have such a high a price tag so those
are just my thoughts on the Kylie brush
bundle like I said I don't support the
Kardashian so I absolutely will not be
purchasing anything from Kylie cosmetics
let alone and this day on brush bundle I
believe some of them actually maybe all
of them you'll be able to purchase
separately but still enough $30 for a
brush especially from something like
Kylie cosmetics isn't really work thank
God you have to make that decision up
for yourself but for me I'm gonna go
with new with new it is not all right
guys let's finally talk about the
kathleenlights colourpop Dream Street
collaboration again I hate to beat the
dead horse with this one but I will not
be purchasing this because I no longer
support kathleenlights I'm sorry there
are a lot of people that have been able
to look past everything that happened
with her and all the controversy
surrounding her um you know on snapchat
seeing the N word and all these kind of
things but I'm just not one of those
people that can't look past that and I
know there are so many people that are
saying you're judging her too harshly
believe you don't know her you know and
the truth is I don't know her but I do
know that when something like that slip
so easily out of your mouth it might be
something that you say at home or behind
closed doors or on the regular and I
don't support that and I'm not okay with
that so I absolutely personally will not
be supporting this collaboration by
purchasing but I know a lot of you
wanted my thoughts on just the color
selection and the overall thoughts of it
so you guys know I am a big fan of color
pop I think lately they have been
releasing out there okay there has
been so many new products there have
been so many new products from
colour-pop recently I'm getting a little
overwhelmed okay you guys know when
brands really start to throw stuff out
there over and over and over again if
you get bit repetitive and it can get
very boring I think color pop did very
well with her eyeshadow palettes the
first couple ones because they really
got people excited and hyped up and they
restock them immediately but now I feel
like there's a new goddamn palette
every single week now when I do look at
this eyeshadow palette you guys know I'm
a big fan of the press a shadow formula
from colour-pop so if you're willing to
support kathleenlights and support this
collaboration I think that palette looks
beautiful I really like the shades that
she chose okay I like that deep coral
shade I like the neutrals in there I
like that transition and those blues
those turquoises are very very nice she
has a good eye for this I think the
packaging is very beautiful as well when
it comes to the lippies I like the two
neutral ones but the orangie red one
I've seen it on a few people it looks
amazing but I feel like she's done a
collaboration was it with Oprah or
something that has a very very similar
shade maybe that one was not as called
like Miami Heat or something it was like
an orange --red I feel like she does a
lot of Reds which she looks beautiful in
Reds okay Kathleen is a beautiful girl
but I just don't really feel like that
red kind of fits into the collection but
I do think the other two shades are
absolutely beautiful so overall if you
want to go ahead and support Kathleen
absolutely go ahead and do that but I
just will not be doing that and I will
not be supporting her or this
collaboration with colourpop's so anyway
guys that is it for my anti Hollie hope
you enjoyed this video please let me
know your thoughts on these products
down below are you gonna pick them up or
you're not gonna pick them up I would
love to know I guess that's pretty much
it and I will see you guys tomorrow for
a follow-up on my Sephora vib sale as
well as on my black friday call so
basically it ton of products I'm gonna
talk about if they worked or if they get
to work okay alright bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
