video is going to be my lipgloss
declutter for 2016 so without further
ado let's just jump right into it the
first lipgloss that I have here is from
Victoria's Secret this is the beauty
rush gloss in the shade and also the
scent
squeeze it is an orange scented gloss I
do enjoy this so I'm going to take that
I am going to let go of this Urban Decay
revolution gloss in the shade tail bait
veil bait
I never reach for this it's a pretty
color but I have a lot of clothes like
that in my collection I will be keeping
this Too Faced lip injection glossy in
the shade
be alert babe alert oh babe alert I
really do enjoy these not for the
reasons that you would think I did a
review on them I don't think they really
plump your lips that much and they don't
have a lot a lot of color payoff but I
talked about in that video how I
actually use these before I go onstage
to kind of get my lips going so that's
what I use them for and that's what I'm
going to keep them for next I have
another one of these Victoria's Secrets
Beauty rush flavoured glosses in so
jelly I'm also going to keep that I have
a Smashbox lip enhancing gloss right
here in the shade pout I'm going to go
ahead and let that go
I'm also gonna let go of this lorac
twentieth anniversary let's see here
highly pigmented lip gloss in beauty
guru ya know I'm gonna let that go I
also have a Revlon gloss here that is
very pretty that I adore it's called 225
berry Alaura I'll be keeping that I will
also be keeping this Tarte energy noir
lip surgence what's it called skin skin
intuitive lip gloss I enjoy this quite a
lot it is rather new to me I also really
like this this is from NYX it is the
mood lip gloss and it actually has like
smile brightening effects to it so it
has a blue tint which makes your teeth
look whiter so I'm gonna keep that I'm
gonna go ahead and declutter this little
guy he's actually now that I look at it
this is not this is not a lip gloss this
was supposed to be in the liquid
lipstick video but this is the ultra
pigmented lip color from forever 21 it
is really really good these are very
very similar to the OCC lip tars but I'm
gonna go ahead and let go of it because
I'm just not into that formulation
anymore I also have this makeup forever
lab shine diamonds collection what is
this called lip gloss in at D 16 I'm
gonna go ahead and let that go as well I
have some of these lorac lips

will see I'm gonna declutter all of
these this first shade is called Josh we
also have these shade mark which is a
little more nudie tones we also have
these shade Alex which is probably my
favorite out of the bunch but it's not a
favorite to the point where I want to
keep it this one right here is called
Chuck really really pretty packaging
though I think I bought these for the
packaging and also been so there is been
so I'm gonna let those go moving on I
have another lorac lip gloss right here
the highly pigmented gloss in the shade
secret agent very very pretty your lips
of a better kind of color but I
preferred the anastacio Beverly Hills
glosses so I'm gonna declutter that so
that I can keep it those speaking of
some good glosses but unfortunately
these have gone bad I have the bite and
beauty um what are these fruit glosses
this was from their watercolor
collection there's a lot of them these
have gone bad so I will count them as a
decluttered item because they will be
decluttered but into the trash bin but
yeah unfortunately these went bad I'm
not too surprised honestly by beauty
products do go bad pretty quickly
because they are so natural so it's not
too like oh those here are some more of
the colors I just never got into them
which is such a shame because those are
beautiful glosses alright moving on I
have a mix of mega shine lip gloss right
here these are very very highly
pigmented but I do prefer the anastacio
Beverly Hills formulation this is in
lollipop but I would recommend checking
these out if you want a good one from
the drugstore

glosses this one right here is called
toffee and I will be going ahead and
keeping that as well as this shade right
here which is called a blushing which is
