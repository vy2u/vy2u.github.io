welcome back to my channel i am back
from my trip as you guys can probably
tell and today i wanted to walk you guys
through five different underhyped makeup
products that I personally have in my
collection that I feel like a lot of
people don't talk about and I feel like
you should have in your collection so
let's go ahead and jump right into it
without further ado I would like to
start with these Smashbox the brow tech
to go this is like my brow baby and now
I feel like today I really kind of
overfilled my brows they look like big
 chunky caterpillars but for the
most parts and this is the one brow
product that I feel like makes my brows
look insane I have never and first seen
anybody talk about this on YouTube
except for me so maybe that's because
I'm not watching the right people or
whatever but I swear this is a great
brow pencil it is the brow tech to go it
does retail for $28 but you are also
getting some brow gel on the other side
here now the shade that I wear is taupe
it definitely is a little dark for my
brows you can really kind of overfill
them like I did today and it looks
really dark or you could just kind of
define them easily I really like this
because it's wide but it's flat I know
that makes absolutely no sense but as
you guys can see it's got a wide little
pencil sort of thing going on here so
it's not so much like a micro precision
a little pencil but then it's very very
skinny and I just feel like it's so nice
to just wipe across um whether that be
on the bottom if you want to start
filling in towards the bottom or if you
just want to fill in the front part of
your brow or the top it's very easy to
use it defines the brows absolutely
beautifully and if you are someone who
is not great with brows like me I would
highly recommend picking this up so
again without does the Smashbox a brow
tech to go pencil I don't feel like
anybody really talks about this is
definitely an under hyped product the
best brow pencil I've ever tried
are you moving on into the Stila perfect
need perfect hue palettes god these are
so under hyped you guys I know I said
for a while there I was gonna declutter
two of them but you know what I use
these all the time when I travel I will
be keeping all of them the first one I
have here is fair / light and you get
two different blushes in here in five
different eyeshadows the eyeshadows do
range in a you know variety of finishes
you get some mattes a few of them do
have glitter and few shades and then you
also do have shivers for the most part I
would say that the mattes and the
shivers in here are fantastic but the
blushes can be pressed a little more
firmly now the blushes can be used on
the eyes that is
I did today with my eye look I will show
you guys the palette I used in a second
here but they are eye safe so you can go
ahead and double them as eye shadow if
you want to pick up a palette that maybe
isn't necessarily meant for your skin
tone you can still make it work but the
fair / light version is great as you
guys can see and it does have a little
mirror here really really compact kind
of like a pocket palette I did a video
all about my favorite pocket palette so
I'll go ahead and throw that up in the
cards if you would like to check it out
but I really do love these palettes and
this one right here is called the light
/ medium probably the most mediocre when
it comes to color selection just because
I feel like I can do about every single
color in here but again these are so
compact and travel friendly so I will be
going ahead and holding on to that one
and then here we have my two favorites
the first one is medium tan and this one
right here is all rose gold if you love
that really fall beautiful berry just
bitten kissing you get in from
the snow and like your eyes are really
like rosy and your cheeks are rosy you
would love this palette now I do have
this blush on today as my transition as
well as worked into my crease my lower
lash line and then I took this sparkly
shade right here and put that onto my
lid this purple in here is a little
scratchy it's a little hard to blend but
they are pigmented they're beautiful and
I feel like they do go onto the eyes a
lot better than they swatch and then
here's the deepest version look at that
blush that is gonna work for those of
you but they really deep complexion I
absolutely love it love this Stila when
I hadn't created palettes for all sorts
of different skin types
I'm sorry skin tones but yeah I really
think that these are just fantastic
so those are a product I feel like
absolutely nobody really talks about
except for me yet again and I would
highly recommend you guys go ahead and
scoop one up from Sephora
alright guys up next we have a blush
formula here that is my all-time
favorite blush formula on earth it is
the illamasqua powder blushes my
favorites are definitely the matte
versions but you can also get the
glitter infused or just be satin ones
now I know
Illamasqua is difficult to get here in
the u.s. I understand okay it used to be
sold at Sephora which is where I got the
majority of my blushes I also have
picked up a few of them from a whole
look when they've been on sale there but
this shade right here is kind of like a
cult favorite it's called Katie I cannot
even describe how soft these are these
are the most soft pigmented and
beautiful beautiful buildable blushes
ever that you can put onto your skin I
mean the feeling of the
is just amazing I also really love the
color selection this shade right here is
called tremble these are great if you do
have more of like a fair to light
complexion but that they have some
really really bold pops of color that
would be great if you do have a deep
complexion and this one right here is
called naked rose one of the most
gorgeous and neutral shades that I have
again in my collection and then here we
have the shade lover which is kind of
like a soft orange creamsicle and I just
really really enjoy these they're so
soft there so blendable they can double
as eyeshadow if you want to go ahead and
go down that route but yes but I highly
recommend the EULA Mosca powder blushes
if you ever have the chance to go ahead
and scoop them up alright guys next we
have the mascara here from Catrice
cosmetics originally when I tried this
out I wasn't a huge fan so was sent for
PR it is the rocket or extreme Volume
Mascara and now originally I kind of
thought of talking about the essence
princess lash but I feel like that has
really gotten a lot of recognition
lately so it's not really an under hype
makeup product anymore but there are
sometimes have two cruelty free a
drugstore mascaras out there and this is
definitely one of them I have it on
today just one coat this is the
waterproof formula so I feel like it
does build a little more volume but then
maybe the irregular version the one
really scared me when I first got there
I was like I don't know about that it
really kind of like you have to be very
careful going into your lower lash line
but this gives me the trifecta lashes it
gives me volume the length as well as
the thickness and I just really really
enjoy this so if you're looking for a
good cruelty-free and drugstore mascara
for under five dollars definitely go for
the Catrice cosmetics rocket or mascara
and finally we have the makeup geek
highlighters now I only have it the
kathleenlights highlighter palette funny
enough again this is a product that I
changed my mind about originally I
wasn't a fan of this formula when I did
the review on it I kind of talked about
how it's very sheer but then I found out
that using the right brush can really
get these two look away and bam
pigmented on your face now the shades
that we have here are sunlight as well
as starlight and night light starlight
which is this beautiful pinky shade is
my all-time favorite you guys can see
you really can apply it lightly and it
will just be kind of like a wash of
highlights and very very natural looking
on the skin or you can go in and pick it
up with like a sigma f-35 tapered
highlighter brush and really build it up
and this will give me the most blinding
highlighter effect ever one of my
favorite things about these highlighter
is that they really really aren't too
powdery I feel like high leaders that I
have in my collection that are buildable
so you can go from sheer to bamm-bamm in
your face like blinding highlight and
definitely usually have a little more of
a coveri consistency these do not I know
a lot of people haven't been talking
about makeup geek Oh recently I really
love makeup think I love what they stand
for I love that their products are not
tested on animals I really like Marlena
I feel like she's very professional
tomorrow we're gonna be talking about
some not so professional makeup
companies but I really just like these
highlighters I like a lot of her
products from makeup geek I'm not a huge
fan of the original shadow formula but I
love her foiled shadows and these
highlighters although they were talked
about right when they came out still and
not a lot of people talk about these
nowadays and I really feel like that's
such a shame because this is a great
highlighter formula if you can't get
this palette anymore you can bind them
individually they have a huge shape
selection which I really appreciate but
yeah those are my five a different and
makeup products that I feel like are
under hyped in my collection I have some
videos like this in the past so if you
would like to see other videos similar
to this I'll go ahead and link my
miscellaneous playlist where I do a lot
of my original video content ideas and
stuff like that I'll go ahead and throw
that up in the cards if you'd like to
check it out but that's pretty much it
thank you so much for joining me guys
and I'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
