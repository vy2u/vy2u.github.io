today's video is going to be all about
discontinued makeup that was bomb as
 now a couple of weeks ago I did a
video all about makeup I think should be
discontinued and this is the exact
opposite these are products I absolutely
loved and I really felt like they
shouldn't be discontinued but
unfortunately they were now the good
news is throughout this video I will try
and give you as some dupes as well as
some advice on what to do with these
brands when they do it discontinue your
favorite product but anyway without
further ado let's go ahead and jump
right into it I want to start with Becca
cosmetics now you guys know Becca
cosmetics is one of my favorite brand
however that will not hold me back from
saying that they are absolute
when it comes to their limited edition
products I feel like it's a 50/50
sometimes they will bring the product
back and then sometimes they will not
taste three pallets right here and never
came back but the good news about Becca
is that a lot of the times they recycle
their shades so if you wanted to get
your hands on one of the products that
I'm about to show definitely go ahead
and keep an eye on their face palettes
in general because they do overlap a lot
of the shimmering skin perfectors and
there as well as the blushes as well as
the bronzers so the first one we have
here is the Becca afterglow palette this
is a gorgeous little travel-size palette
and initially I didn't want this because
of the size funny enough I actually
prefer a little more of a bigger or
sturdier face palettes but my friend Meg
actually sent this to me
she was not getting a lot of use out of
it and I adore it cuz the pants are so
small I do go in with a smaller brush
but the shape that you have in here are
moonstone shimmering skin perfecter
you also have rose gold as well as toe
pads and then you have wild honey
and a flower child blush absolutely one
of my favorites would highly recommend
you guys check it out in full size here
is the first of becca jaclyn hill
palette do you guys remember this from
like 2015 and this is the champagne glow
palette so this was before they came out
with the big palette right here and in
here you have three different shimmering
skin perfector you have curl as well as
champagne pop and blushed copper now
what I really really liked about this
palette was not only that I had a huge
mirror but also it's very simplistic
there's just three different shades here
these ones I do have a formula that is
eye safe so I really do enjoy going
ahead and using them on my cheeks as
well as my eyes I thought this was a
really really good color selection
especially the first time you're going
to be incorporating your thoughts into
like a beauty brand or doing some sort
of a collaboration I thought this was a
very very good start
palate and then a year later she came
out with the Jacqueline heels champagne
pop collection and this is amazing this
is the best palate that I currently have
in my face palette collection and I have
a lot okay in here you do have to matte
blushes shade right here which is called
Pomplamoose again any sort of Becca
palette that you get during the holiday
season is going to have some sort of a
reuse blush that looks like this
you also have amaretto which is very
similar to a wild honey as well as a few
other matte blushes that they have that
are permanent in their collections so
definitely check that out and then you
also have Rosie spritz which is a
luminous flush blush it is very very
similar to Snapdragon which is permanent
here we have champagne pop as well as
Prosecco pop both of these are currently
permanent as far as I'm concerned but I
yeah those are the three different
discontinued pallets from Becca there
were bum as all right let's go
ahead and move on to urban decay I do
enjoy urban decay as a brand but they
are by no means one of my favorite
brands
however they release this little
eyeshadow single years and years and
years ago it's actually a product that
is in at my sentimental makeup box if
you guys missed that video where I talk
about sentimental of beauty products
I'll go ahead and throw it up in the
cards but this is the urban decay frigid
deluxe eye shadow single and it is
amazing I'm gonna do a close-up here so
you guys can really see what this looks
like as well as they swatch but it's
basically this deep a violet color with
a little bit of a silver and a blue
sheen running through it unfortunately I
have not been able to find a dupe for
this so I can't give you guys a dupe but
I really really did enjoy that product
and the other one from Urban Decay that
I wanted to mention it was there beauty
balm
now recently I talked about how I don't
want to see perfumes or anything non
beauty related for Urban Decay now this
is technically a beauty related I guess
you could say but they had this naked
skin at beauty balm which is supposed to
go all over your body and it really kind
of evened out a skin texture as well as
like cellulite but have them I asked as
well as any kind of stretch marks and
just like red splotches and blotches
they ended up discontinuing this about a
year ago and then they brought out the
one and done Naked hybrid complexion
Perfector which is for the face I really
really wish they would have gone ahead
and kept that beauty balm around cuz it
was so good but yeah those are
the two it discontinued products from
urban decay as it were balm as
let's go ahead and move on to wet and
wild I could do a part two literally
dedicated
wet-and-wild products that have been
discontinued that I thought were amazing
but the pallet I specifically want to
talk about is the drinking a glass of
shine pallet now you can still find this
on like eBay and maybe on Amazon
but a lot of this stuff has been used
and opened up I have hit pan on pretty
much the whole entire right row of this
pallet as you guys can see you have
really really bright colors on the left
hand side and then neutrals on the other
this was a completely matte palette and
that is very very different for wet and
wild I noticed that with their trios and
especially like their old-school
8 pan palettes a lot of them
unfortunately did not have enough in
that shade so a lot of them were very
shimmery or glittery infused and I do
love the formula of the wet and wild
color icon shadows but I just wish there
were more palettes that look like this
now if you weren't able to get your
hands on this you can go ahead and pick
up the new a matte format pallet from
elf cosmetics I believe this is called
the jewel palette or the jewel pot
palette this is actually something that
I have my eye on because so many people
have been saying it's similar to the
old-school button wild palette wet and
wild also recently updated all of their
new eyeshadow formulas and I haven't
tried them out yet some people are
saying really good things some people
are not but that was a damn good palette
and I loved that it was all matching yet
you had bright colors and neutrals in
there alright and finally is Stila now
Stila has really done some revamping and
updating of their beauty products and
just their makeup and line in general
within the past couple of years but they
used to have this tinted moisturizer
that was amazing you guys I didn't
really love it when I had more combo
oily skin because it was very very
shimmery and but when I moved down here
I actually did end up liking it it's
funny because it was a product I was
like ready to declutter and then I did
it and I kept it for myself I used it
all up and I was like oh my god let me
get a new one I went on to the
sephora.com website I went on to the
 steel a website and realized
it's not even available anymore
they actually replaced it with a beauty
balm sort of like The Naked Skin one I
was talking about but for your face
unfortunately this one is just not the
same if you compare the ingredients
side-by-side they are different it does
come in a squeezy bottle again which is
nice but it's just not nearly as good I
mean this tinted moisturizer just made
your skin look like it was glowing from
within it gave the smallest amount of
coverage but it wasn't in a really
really prominent way it just made you
look like
skin was just healthy like you
had just put like some rosehip seed oil
or some hobo oil on okay but it's still
covered and blurred things so I was
really disappointed to see it that the
beauty balm is not the same ingredient
and was not the same product also I
wanted to mention the two eyeshadow
palettes that I feel like I do actually
regret decluttering now I've gotten a
lot of comments from people asking if I
will do a whole video dedicated to
makeup I regret decluttering but
honestly I really don't have any I am
one of those people that's very very
like on top of it if I like it I like it
if I don't I don't and I really don't
seem to miss makeup however if these two
palettes right here we're amazing now
they were this like old-school kind of
cardboard packaging and Stila has said
that they updated them and put them into
the new like ice or the window kind of
palettes but i got one of those for
myself I actually ended up decluttering
it because the formula was just not the
same Stila kind of took it there really
really soft shadows and they press them
like a little firmer and some people
really do enjoy that some people do not
some people hate kick up some people
hate soft shadows it just depends on
what you're looking for I like something
that's in between I'm a big big big
sucker for foiled shades really really
soft buttery shadows I just feel like I
can work with them a lot better you have
the in the light palette as well as the
in the moment the in the moment have
more purple tones to it and then the in
delight had more neutral tones to it now
any sort of like to face chocolate bar
palette is most likely going to adieu
pout the in the light palette but still
that formula was so good they were so
soft and so buttery and then when it
comes to the in the moment I would say
anything that has sort of a purple theme
to it or a cool tone theme but with a
purple pop you are going to find
something that is going to be as similar
as far as the looks that you can create
if you're not a fan of the chocolate bar
Palace they did recently release the
chocolate gold palette which is probably
one of my favorite chocolate bar
palettes if you guys would like me to do
a whole video dedicated to chocolate
bars maybe they'll call it like
chocolate craze which chocolate bar
palette is right for you let me know
down below but that is it for today's
video and these are makeup products I'm
gonna miss when I use them up
okay I am going to miss them these are
really really good products it's
unfortunate to see it when brands do go
ahead and and do like a whole overhaul
of the brand or maybe they just continue
some products that weren't selling very
well I just recommend going ahead and if
searching for dupes looking for stuff in
your collection that could be similar
and if you can't find stuff in your
collection that similar go and Shop
stores though into Sephora go into Ulta
go ahead and swatch out some BB cream
some CC creams find something that's
similar to that kind of formula that you
loved anyway guys that is it for today's
video thank you so much for joining me
and I will see you guys on Wednesday bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
