quick DIY how to make your bedroom look
cozier this is something I've been doing
for the past two years and it involves
just the Christmas lights that are
hanging on the back of my bedpost so
basically I've been doing this for three
years like I said the first year I did
what should I do
I think I did multi-coloured and then
last year I did pink but this year I
found the coziest color are these little
white ones they really make the bedroom
look cozy they make everything look
really really cute and you can even have
your little stuffed animals out which of
course I do and a real stuffed animal so
I think that it just gives such a cute
appearance to the bedroom and it really
makes it look cozy in literally one step
I'll show you guys what it looks like
when the lights are off because I think
that's when it looks the coziest so here
is with the lights off again this was
just like one string of Christmas lights
white Christmas lights I got them at Bed
Bath &amp;amp; Beyond and I think they just make
the room look so so cozy so that was my
little DIY
I hope you guys enjoyed it and I'll see
you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
