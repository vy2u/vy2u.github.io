I wanted to show you a really cute
little DIY alternative to shower curtain
rings I actually use my shower curtain
rings that came with my cute little
shower curtain for an alternative reason
I will show you guys that in my next
video but I wanted to show you a cute
little DIY that you can do that is super
super easy all you need is ribbon and
you just can use whatever colors you
want and all you have to do is tie your
shower curtain liner and the shower
curtain together by a cute little piece
of ribbon you can alternate colors like
I did here I have this going all the way
across my shower curtain I think it's
adorable I love it and like I said I use
my shower curtain rings for an
alternative reason which is why I needed
to find another way to hold my shower
curtain up these are really really tiny
but they actually hold up really well
they're super sturdy and I'm just like
really happy that they can hold this
shower curtain and it's nice because
they do slide so when you're sliding the
shower curtain open it doesn't like get
too tight and whatnot so I really really
love this idea you can do this with
thick ribbon thin ribbon you can do it
with you know whatever you want really
but I just wanted to show you guys that
really cute little DIY again so so easy
and yet so cute and festive I hope you
guys enjoyed this video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
