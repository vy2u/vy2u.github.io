things I've done in my bedroom down
there was my makeup but it is a mess and
I'm not ready to show it yet so you know
when I do a makeup collection video
hopefully we'll be in better condition
but um I basically did this whole wall
my bed is behind this and so I wake up
and I see this in the morning these are
all inspirational quotes that I've
written out myself and then I have some
masks I'm like obsessed with masks I
know that's weird I but I am I don't
know I have a fascination with them so
this one is a handmade one from Seattle
I love cats obviously and then this one
through Italy this one's from Italy this
one's from Italy the creepiest ones are
from Italy with us they're actually my
favorites this one's off Supper mini-me
and then this one is from Italy I got
this one in Venice and I just have a few
photos of me playing violin music has
always been my thing my a musician so I
play flute now but I like to reminisce
on when I play violin and so all of
these are just quotes and I have them
like you know written on different kinds
of paper I did some little like cut out
things here some drawings I'm like I
blame it on my left handedness but I
cannot cut like evenly so I got these
ones like from the store so when I end
up cutting I do like something like this
so it looks like artsy but truly it's
just I can't okay so have that up there
that mask and then these three little
things were on hair clips and they
actually felt a wife so I just popped
him up there I thought what the heck I
don't want to throw them out this is
actually interesting I wanted to do a
collage up here like a painting which is
funny because I probably would not be
good at painting but I ended up finger
painting with makeup which I thought was
really fitting for me since I love
makeup so much so I have a shadow on
here lipstick and eyeliner
and I did another one here with lipstick
and eyeliner so again just some cute
little cute little quotes pictures
things like that lots of stickers I'm
like a little kid at heart I love
stickers so I'm gonna cover the camera
quickly not ready to do a bedroom tour
yet and show you guys above my bed I
didn't actually make this growing up my
neighbor made this for me but it was
it's like 12 years old now and I've been
storing it in a box and recently I put
it above my bed and I added some like
felt and stuff to her painted on dress I
thought it was kind of cute it has my
name and it's just like you know
adorable I thought it was really cute
and I thought oh it's DIY because I put
that on there but no I could never
actually do this so I have my perfumes
down there but again a separate video
for those but I have these three little
quotes kind of wind this way which I
thought was cute I like that you know I
just like the way that looks
so I have three here this one says
kindness is a language that the Deaf can
hear and the blind can see this one says
be silly be honest be kind think happy
thoughts be who you are and this one's
kind of fun it says be the kind of girl
that when your feet hit the floor each
morning the devil says oh crap
she's up so I kind of like that just you
know on the white wall and then of
course over there so I'm going to cover
this up again and showed you guys in my
hallway I have this little thing here on
that rack I think is from Anthropologie
please excuse the little like these were
supposed to come off really easily I put
little ornaments on here for a while
last year and I can't get this off so
I'm hoping enough to use coupon or
something but this is just like a coat
hanger and I ended up just hanging
purses like three of the ones that I
thought were really bright and colorful
and cute so that's in the hallway and
then if you guys are wondering
or I store the rest of my purses I like
to store them by shower curtain like
rods or not rods hangers because then I
can just like flip through them and see
which one I want to use for the day
so I think that's a I guess that's kind
of DIY so anyway um those are just a few
things I wanted to show you guys I hope
you enjoyed this and I hope I have
inspired you to go do some DIY stuff
yourself so I'll talk to you guys later
