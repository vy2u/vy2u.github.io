all having a wonderful day today's video
is going to be a double sephora
follow-up hall so i'm going to be
sharing scuze me frog in my throat i'm
going to be sharing my thoughts on as
they passed to support halls that i have
done on my channel the products that i
picked up I'm gonna let you guys know
kind of my first impressions and a
little more than first impressions
because I have had these with it I have
had these items for a while now so let's
go ahead and get right into it i'm going
to start with an item that I'm not crazy
about I have it in my hair right now
this is the Sephora express dry shampoo
it's supposed to be odor eliminating its
supposed to give you fast fresh and
clean hair very quickly or whatever so
this is what it looks like I did
purchase this I think for five or six
dollars it was on sale so it's not like
I feel terrible that I don't love it but
I have it in my hair right now honestly
it just kind of makes my hair look a lot
more textured that I would like now do
you have my hair back home today you
guys know I've been back home in my hair
and throwing it in a messy bun for like
the past two months and I do like the
texture however um the white cast that
at least in my hair is absolutely
ridiculous like this is probably one of
the worst dry shampoos as far as leaving
a white cast in your hair is concerned
so I don't think I would repurchase this
I really don't think it's that great it
is a very very light on the hair I will
say that it doesn't feel super thick but
it does give a little bit of I don't
know how to describe it it gives texture
like it looks like it gives texture but
it doesn't feel like it's textured if
that makes sense so it doesn't feel
grimy or anything in the hair it
actually feels really light weight it
has a nice scent it's not too
overpowering but it just leaves a
horrible white cast maybe i'll use this
once i get my hair colored again because
it won't be as noticeable but i feel
like an old lady today like i have lots
of great going on so that is an item
that i picked up that I'm not that
impressed with the next item I want to
talk about is one that i love and i have
almost finished this up already this is
the bosha makeup break up cool cleansing
oil I think I picked this up in the last
haul or the one before I really don't
know I think it was the last haul that I
did I love this this is an amazing
amazing product for breaking down her
makeup at nighttime
I like to go in and use about seven
pumps of this all over my face and it
takes off all of my eye makeup it takes
off all of my face makeup it takes off
you know if I've been wearing like a
liquid lip like I am today it takes all
of that off and then I do follow up with
my rock resurfacing disk I just think
this is a beautiful beautiful product
and I do like the kind of cooling
sensation that it leaves on my skin it
leaves absolutely no residue so if you
are concerned about that you do not have
to worry with this particular product
but I love that and I will be
repurchasing another bozhe item that I
had purchased this is actually for Tom
when he goes to iceland in about a week
and a half he's going out with his
buddies they're doing a little guys trip
and this is the boscia detoxifying black
cleanser I got this in the 1.7 fluid
ounce of version because I thought it
would be perfect for him for travel I
have used it a couple of times I just
made sure to put that little on safety
thing back on so that the pump wasn't
loose but overall I do love this
cleanser I think he's really going to
like it as well I do prefer using this
during the wintertime it actually does
have active charcoal in it so when you
rub it on your face it actually warms up
and I do feel like it detoxifies the
pores it's a really really beautiful
face wash I would personally purchase a
full-size during the wintertime because
I like that heating sensation on my face
but during the summertime I do prefer
something a little more cooling but I
think he is going to love this and we
would repurchase something that is
definitely going back to sephora is the
to face of mascara melt off this is a
cleansing oil that removes waterproof
mascara and it's supposed to dissolve
basically waterproof mascara I already
talked a little bit about why I'm not a
huge fan of this in my fails and holy
grails but the concept is that you take
this little wand here which by the way
the packaging leaks like crazy so make
sure if you do want to get this and you
do purchase it you are leaving it like
upright like this because if you lay it
on its side it will start to leak which
is gross because it's very oily but the
concept is that you take this wand and
you put it on your lashes you leave it
on for about 10 seconds and then you can
wipe it away or wash it off the problem
is is that you are getting all of the
little mascara bits that are coming off
you're getting it back onto the wand and
then you're putting it back into the
packaging I think that's really gross I
am not about that life so this will be
going back to sephora my mom was
interested in trying this so maybe I'll
let her try it but again I think it's so
gross because it already has my old
mascara like at the bottom of the tube
and I'm gonna pass it on to my mom like
that's disgusting anyway it just left my
hands really oily as well because like i
said the packaging does leak so that was
a big fail the next item i had purchased
was the hourglass ambient strobe
lighting power in incandescent power
powder in incandescent strobe light this
is what it looks like here is the
packaging I'm a huge fan of the
formulation on these ambient strobe
lighting powders I love the shade
brilliant and I love this one as well
it's beautiful it's just a light
iridescent pink color I think it's
absolutely stunning and I need to
collect all of these I really do I think
these are probably one of my all-time
favorites highlighting products ever
there it is on my hand if you can see it
I feel like you really can build it up
quite strongly this just tipped over and
it's gonna leak again but I feel like
you can build this up quite strongly
strongly you can build it up to like a
wham bam in your face sort of highlight
on your skin or you can leave it really
really natural it's beautiful it has
tiny little chunks of glitter in it but
it's not noticeable on the skin if you
want a really gorgeous like glow from
within sort of highlight I highly
recommend checking out these ambient
lighting stroke powders so excited for
that I do love that i also had picked up
the Too Faced love flush long lasting
16-hour blush in the shade baby love I
talked about this in yesterday's video
in the nude blush showdown video
beautiful beautiful blush I love the
color it does look a little more peachy
on my cool toned fair skin but I feel
like with a tan which I have going on
right now I've been self tanning with
the Jergens if you guys have been
curious a lot of you have been asking
about that maybe I'll do a self tanning
video on how I kind of put it on and
things like that but here is baby love I
think it looks beautiful it definitely
looks more nude when I do have my self
tanner on when the South tanner is not
on it definitely looks a little more
peachy but it's a gorgeous color really
love it and you guys know I'm obsessed
with the formulation on these 16 hour
blushes so really happy with that
purchase I also purchased this clinique
uplighting illuminating powder in the
shade is 0-1 a nude glow beautiful
packaging kind of like the ambient
stroke powders you get a lot of products
in here for around twenty seven dollars
this is a gorgeous
topper or highlight you can use it kind
of for whatever you want it does remind
me a lot of the hourglass products oh my
god that freakin to face thing keeps
tipping over um it reminds me a lot of
the ambient strobing powders mixed
together with just the regular ambient
lighting powders it's beautiful i love
the globe gives to my skin it's very
satiny and look stunning on the skin and
i'm very very happy with this purchase
as well the best i know i have purchased
were two bags of the shiseido facial
contents i would become obsessed with
these i will not use anything else near
my eye area opened it up at the bottom
but i won't use anything else around my
eye area because these are just so soft
and they really are just significantly
softer than any other cotton pad that
you use and I feel like the area around
your eyes the skin is very delicate and
if you're going to use any sort of
cotton round on your face you can use
whatever on your face but when it comes
to your eye area I think that it is
really really a good idea to kind of
purchase something that's super soft you
don't have to get these like this
packages I think nine dollars and fifty
cents on the sephora.com website which
is kind of ridiculous but I just won't
go back to anything else so I use those
only for my eye area I don't think it's
worth it everywhere on the face just
because it's very expensive for one big
you know tub of them but I do like them
for the eye area the next item I had
purchased was this little set of Korres
body butters loving these if you guys
can find these on the support web site I
heard there in the sale section right
now I would HIGHLY highly recommend
going ahead and purchasing them these
are beautiful body butters I kept them
in this little like set here the little
box actually and we actually store this
up on top of our little area like we
have a vanity area in the bathroom and
we store this on top of there because
it's so pretty i love the way this looks
i love the dark box and the theme in our
didn't give me the theme in our master
bathroom is actually like dark wood and
like pretty like dark black you know
stuff like that so anyway this looks
really really pretty on top of our
little vanity area but these are
beautiful beautiful body butters they're
very very lightweight and they sink in
extremely quickly but they really do
moisturize really nicely my favorite
sent out of all of them of course is the
rose one I love the Rose scent from
Korres I love
roseline and I feel like this smells
very similar kind of like fermented rose
if that makes sense it's really
beautiful really enjoy that one and
Tommy Lee likes the fig 1 so we have
been enjoying these a lot my least
favorite is the yogurt one I feel like
it kind of smells strange but they are
really really nice and I would consider
purchasing a full size of the Rose 14
shirt and then the last two items I had
purchased in this little round of halls
how were the oly hendrickson grease
relief facial waters and also the truth
facial water so I'm going to be doing a
review on these next week as well as a
demo I have good things to say about
these and also some not go not so good
things to say about them I think the
price is right on these however um I
don't think they're the best facial
sprays they're a little tacky a little
sticky and again I'll go into a little
more detail when i do the actual review
and demo but ya did pick these up and
stay tuned next week and see what i have
to say about those before you do
purchase them yourself so anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed this little sephora
follow-up all thank you so much for
joining me and i will see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
