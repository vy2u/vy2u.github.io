my channel I have absolutely no idea if
you can hear the pitter patter on the
windowsill but it's currently raining
here in Arizona I know that may sound
really weird but guess what
Arizona needs the rain here in the
desert we need the rain so I'm very
excited right now but today I do have a
drugstore haul to share with you guys
this is my winter 2018 a drugstore haul
I'm very excited because I wanted to
pick up some of these products some of
them have been on my wish list like my
little beauty wishlist all that kind of
stuff so let's go ahead and jump right
into it I did go to Target I went to
Walgreens as well as CVS so the first
couple of things that I picked up were
actually from Milani this first one you
guys have been recommending to me for a
freaking a long time this is the Milani
and make it last setting spray it says
prime corrects and sets your whole
entire face in for 16 hours and it also
keeps color from fading and settling
into creases now I feel like this was a
pretty reasonable price for 2.3 ounces
of a product but I'm very excited to
test it out I know a lot of you guys
seem to love that I also did pick up the
Milani retouch plus erase like lifting
concealer says it conceals dark circles
it covers spots of blemishes and
imperfections and brightens and
revitalizes I believe it was Jessica
Braun here on YouTube that I stopped
talking about this it has a sponge tip
applicator and I did get the shade light
0 - I got one that was just a little
darker I'm not currently self-tan I'm
sure you guys have been able to tell in
the past couple of videos but I have not
been self-tanning however I plan to
tonight so I wanted to get a shade that
was a little darker that I can use
underneath my eyes I've been trying to
use like my Tarte shaped tape underneath
my eyes recently and like my Tarte
rainforest of the sea aqua sealer
concealer and they're way way way too
light so I need a good under-eye
concealer and I heard this one's very
nice just like a bronze said that it was
a full coverage but at the same time it
left a little bit of a glossy feeling so
I think that's gonna be great or a
glossy finish underneath the eye so I
think that's gonna be great for my dry
skin I also did pick up the Milani
eyeshadow primer I've gone through like
5 full sizes of these in my lifetime I
love these so this is a great eye primer
you guys it's cruelty free it's a
drugstore and it's very very similar to
the Urban Decay a primer potion the
original one so I did pick that up
alright I picked up a cushion foundation
now I have tried out Christian
foundations in the past one I wasn't
cruelty free I tried out the L'Oreal one
and the Maybelline one I hated both of
them one of my skin
more combo oily because they were just
so slippery on my face and too oily and
now that I'm dry as the Sahara Desert
aka I live in the desert um I went ahead
and picked up the Physicians Formula
mineral wear talk free all-in-one
cushion foundation in the shade light
and I'm very skeptical when it comes to
Physicians Formula I know that they are
opening up their shade selection and
making more of like the butter bronzers
and deeper shades but usually their
foundations are way way way too dark for
me even when I sell tan but I thought I
would give this one a go this is what it
looks like the packaging is just
adorable I mean come on it looks like
you do get a little mirror with a little
screen thing there so that you can cover
it and then the shade looks kind of dark
and orangie but we're gonna attempt it
after I self tan so I'm excited to
attest that foundation out I did pick up
two foundations during this haul and
originally I wanted to do like
foundation Friday videos with them but
honestly there's so many videos I'm
behind on right now I don't plan on
doing another foundation Friday for
probably a good month so I'm just gonna
crack into these so very excited for
that I also did pick up the wedding well
photo focus press powder can you believe
that I have the foundation the concealer
but not the powder I've heard good
things about this but I always thought
that it was more of like a oil
controlling powder not so much a setting
powder
it feels really light and it kind of
sounds like sandpaper but it feels soft
and I feel like this is gonna be a great
shade for me it's called 8 to 1 a warm
light so I'm excited to try that out I
do like to set my whole entire face in
and stipple it on to basically lock in
my foundation all day long so I would
keep you guys updated on that alright
moving onto some products from NYX I saw
that they had a born to glow
illuminating primer
I really like their illuminating setting
spray or I mean their dewy finish
setting spray so I thought I'd go ahead
and try this out see if it's any good on
the back of the box it does say a primer
that gives the face a luminous glow
while targeting dull skin for a brighter
and more radiant appearance so let me do
a little I just want to see what this
looks like let's pour a little bit out
on the back of my hand wow it is just
popping out of the bottle okay so that's
what it looks like looks like it kind of
reminds me of like Becca's pearl oh but
it's very smooth and I like that it's
not overly shiny one thing that I
complain a lot about when it comes to
very very hydrating and also incredibly
illuminating primers is I feel like they
leave an artificial cast or glow to the
scanner
I like that this doesn't look artificial
smells like blueberries anyway I'm
excited for that
I also picked up finally at one of these
NYX ombre of blushes I've had my eye on
these forever but I always thought that
they were incredibly expensive but then
I realized you get a ton of product
in here and I should just pick one up so
this shade I got it's called zero b07
soft flush if you have never seen these
before they have a huge mirror which is
awesome and then they have this
beautiful matte color like vibrant color
it goes down into a highlight these
kinda remind me of like those it
cosmetics ombre of blushes I have
sugarplum fairy which is gorgeous and oh
my god oh my god now I feel like I have
to buy all of them I'm gonna go ahead
and swatch it holy
oh yeah bitch yes look at that color wow
what a gorgeous color okay I'm very very
happy and I feel like I need to purchase
some more at these now too
so that is the NYX ombre blush in the
shade soft slush and then I also went
ahead and picked up a NYX eyebrow pencil
this was just called the NYX eyebrow
pencil believe it or not the shade is
called taupe even though it looks like a
chocolate brown color I don't know
really what this looks like and I feel
like oh gosh it came right off I always
worry about this on camera I'm like am I
gonna be able to get it out on time I
wanted to see okay it's kind of like one
of those micro a brow sort of things but
um wow that is warm tone do you guys see
that this looks interesting it's not
really pointed it's kind of flat this is
the kind of thing that I like for my
eyebrow so I thought I'd give it a go
I've been wearing my Smashbox brow tech
to go a lot recently and I still like to
try out new products so we'll see that
color looks really more alright guys and
then I also did a pick up at this guy
right here this is the last makeup
product it's actually from birth bees
now I want to say really quickly I've
been getting a ton like a ton of
comments lately saying Burt's Bees is no
longer cruelty free now I know a lot of
you have been linking who is it cruelty
free kitties website for me personally
when it comes to cruelty free
information I do go to tichina's website
which is logical harmony net and that is
where I like to get the majority of my
information
I have not heard anything about Burt's
Bees no longer being cruelty free from
her and also I actually contacted Burt's
Bees cuz I was really worried you guys
know I love their cleansing oil and a
lot of skincare products from them so I
contacted them and they said nothing has
changed so if you have definitive proof
of them no longer being cruelty free
please let me know because I will no
longer purchase from them but as of
right now I feel like those are just
kind of accusations that are not really
true so I did go ahead and pick up the
new goodness glows foundation this is
liquid makeup with a reasonably a source
a meadow foam I don't know what the
that is our full coverage minimal
minimal mineral formula Leah skin
smoother and more radiant with a natural
finish that's not heavy or greasy on the
skin it says our moisturizing foundation
instantly hydrates and nourishes the
skin with metal foam seed oil known for
its skin moisturizing benefits and
naturally beautiful results of both
inside and out I did swatch this shade
which is called one zero one zero ivory
which is the second to lightest shade
out on the back of my hand it looked
gorgeous now I've heard some
not-so-great things about this
foundation but the people that I was
watching them test out I think it was a
terrific as well as the Tayla
and they both have oily skin and I have
dry skin so I'm really excited to just
as that we'll see if it's any good but
yeah it does come with a pump as you
guys can see and like I said I just
haven't really been able to find any
definitive response on whether or not
Burt's Bees is still cruelty free or not
as far as I'm concerned they are if you
have different information please let me
know down below and finally let's jump
into these skincare the first item I
picked up was from Alba Botanica this is
the hawaiian detox scrub it says
anti-pollution volcanic clay
hypoallergenic no parabens at they
delayed synthetic fragrances a hundred
percent a vegetarian ingredients it
smells really good and it looks kind of
cool to kind of like that dark charcoal
color and I've been looking for a good
scrub I recently ran out of my Ola
Henriksen what is it transforming scrub
the walnut one that smells like
blueberries so I thought I would go
ahead and give this one a go and then I
did pick up the Burt's Bees micellar
cleansing water I actually used it this
morning
it felt a little abrasive for my skin my
skin got a little red as well so I don't
know if it's the main ingredient in here
which is white Cyprus oil but this is
the micellar cleansing water says it
removes makeup it cleanses and a
now I did not use it for makeup removal
I've just used it to kind of quick
cleanse my face in the morning but I
have to continue to use it Burt's Bees
products sometimes they have like sage
and things that are a little more
irritating on the skin even their
ingredients list sometimes people are
not you know they're not affected by
those kind of ingredients but I
sometimes I'm especially sage and
lavender so I have to be careful with
this but we shall see you get a large
amount of product in here and I believe
this retails for around $11 you get 12
fluid ounces a product or at 350 4.8 m/l
alright guys and finally I picked up a
few items from pixie this was obviously
a target two the first one is something
that you guys seem to really hate I
posted a picture on Instagram and a lot
of you were saying you hate this it's
the pixie skin treats and nourishing
cleansing balm with sweet almond oil as
well as cocoa butter it's a balm to oil
cleanser and apparently this is actually
one of those balm to oil cleansers that
you have to remove with a makeup
removing wipe or some sort of a cloth or
a washcloth so basically you put it on
the skin it takes your makeup off but
you don't just rinse with water because
then you're gonna get that weird sort of
texture like it won't rinse off because
it kind of leaves a film on the skin so
you do have to go and look like a makeup
eraser or something like that but I
actually don't mind especially if it's
gonna leave my skin lift with a little
bit of moisture lately I have actually
been liking that normally I'm not one of
those people that likes that excess a
residual sort of feeling on my skin but
now that my skin is dry I do not
care
alright and then here I did pick up the
pixie glow tonic to go this is 5 percent
glycolic acid and aloe vera cleansing
pads you guys know I'm a big fan of the
original pixie glow tonic so I thought I
would pick these little guys up they
seemed really soft and easy to use so
I'm very excited for those and then
finally I did pick this little guy up
and I have been using this and I'm
pretty damn impressed this is the pixie
skin treats h2o skin drink it is a pure
hydration jalleh anna says thirsty skin
relief intensive moisture gel instantly
rehydrates dry skin again is sort of
like Burt's Bees there are some
interesting new fragrances going on in
some of the pixie skin care products but
this is really nice it pumps out really
beautifully it kind of it's a gel and
then you put it on the skin it instantly
turns into like a water light
moisturizer but then it leaves almost
like a little bit of like oil on the
skin
description but if you tried this you
know what I'm talking about I feel like
it would work for a lot of different
skin types and actually it gives a nice
amount of moisture to my very very sad
dry skin so anyway guys that is it that
is the little drugstore a winter 2018
haul that I have for you guys today I
hope you enjoyed this video I will have
a follow-up haul going up next week
combined with my Sephora follow-up haul
so I will see you guys then
so that we can talk all about these
products and I will let you know if they
work for me or if they didn't alright
