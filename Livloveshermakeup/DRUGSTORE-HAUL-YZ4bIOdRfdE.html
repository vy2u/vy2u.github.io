thank you so much for joining me i hope
you are all having a fantastic day i was
actually going to put a or post a pre
uploaded video today as a full get ready
with me using only elf cosmetics
products and i think i will put that
video up later tonight but i just now
went to the drugstore to walgreens to
pick up some prescriptions and i ended
up getting a bunch of random stuff that
i thought i would just go ahead and
share with you guys because a lot of the
stuff is makeup related and hold on a
second to get my baby wipes handy dandy
and ready to go but anyway a lot of this
stuff is makeup related and there's just
some random stuff in here so i thought i
would go ahead and film this for you
guys right now and then if you see me
later in a video it was filmed a
different day which is why my outfit is
different but anyway let's get right
into it i'm going to start with an a
craft so wet'n'wild recently released a
bunch of new makeup and I saw this wet
and wild mega glow illuminating palette
and this is in the shade 320 catwalk
pink and I'm trying to get this damn
label off because I know it's going to
be hard when wild literally please
change your packaging because it drives
me up the wall but anyway I saw this
next to like a display of a bunch of new
wet'n'wild makeup and I have to say I
was a little disappointed because I saw
that they reformulate is the contouring
palette I love the toffee one and it
looks like they now made the
highlighting shade like seriously yellow
and then the toffee shade or the
contouring shade the actual darker shade
that you contour with is literally like
10 times warmer it doesn't look nearly
as cool so I was kind of disappointed
about that but this illuminating palate
isn't the same sort of packaging and
format as the contouring duos it's just
as big and like I said this one is in
320 catwalk pink and this is what it
looks like and I'm super excited I want
to go ahead and swatch it for you guys
it feels really really nice and buttery
to the touch when I mix them all
together there is definitely some kick
on but this is what the color looks like
right there I'm going to go ahead and
squash it so really really pretty it
looks like it's kind of like a peachy
sparkly color um not really super finely
milled it looks like it has
definitely some shimmer in there like
noticeable shimmer but hopefully it
won't like accentuate your pores or
anything like that so I'm excited to try
that and of course you can also use each
little section separately and do like an
eye look or put your brush just into one
little segment so that you can do just
that color for the highlight and I like
that it's really really big so that is
the first thing that I picked up the wet
and wild illuminating palette if I can
make up item I picked up is from Rimmel
this is another one of their stay back
powders i love this press powder and
this one is in transparent wow it's
really sad and is that my shade
transparent literally my skinniest
transparent uh-huh but this is what it
looks like really really awesome it
really does keep you Matt and this one
doesn't really have any color to it
maybe like a little bit of a yellow
undertone but nothing crazy so this is
what it looks like and again the shade
is 0 0 1 transparent alright so I picked
that up just because I love this and
mine is like completely used up all the
way to the pan already so I need another
one and then I picked up another one of
my covergirl plus olay CC creams this is
the tone rehab foundation this is my
favorite CC cream ever and the shade i
get is 105 ivory it goes up to my face
pretty i am wearing it today it goes on
to my face pretty like I have the other
tube there i don't know i wanted to
squash a few guys but to explain it like
basically goes on really really kind of
white and a completely color correct but
then after you let it sit for awhile it
can darken up a bit on the skin but it's
really really natural in the skin really
really pretty and unfortunately they are
just continuing this product however
they reformulate it into their new
foundation so the new foundation that
you see that is swirled like this one
that is basically what this CC cream is
so it's beautiful it's got a wonderful
texture it really hydrates the skin it
goes on beautifully i blend it in with
my fingers like today i am doing i did
my i'm in a hurry sort of makeup thing
that i normally do when I'm in a hurry
and
I'm going to make a tutorial on that
look because it literally is like two to
five minutes literally I can put all the
makeup on in two to five minutes and it
looks like presentable I'm not going to
say I'm looking super super adorable
today by any means but I was in a hurry
and i'm going to show you guys that
tutorial at some point but i always use
this for when I'm in a hurry so I really
do love this product unfortunately like
I said it is on clearance right now pick
it up if you can because it's literally
like eight dollars right now but the new
foundation is bigger you get more
product but it is around $17 but i will
be purchasing it because i love that
product alright next there were a few
new lip products from wet'n'wild that I
thought looked amazing these are their
matte lip pencils and I think I got most
of the colors I think there were six and
I got four of them and the first shade
this is I think it's so great that
they're doing like a lip like a
completely matte lip pencil I just I
love it so the first shade is called but
I'm a 364 charred cherry and these are
basically just completely matte lip
pencils lip crayons whatever you want to
call it velvet matte lip color that is
what the packaging looks like love the
packaging I think it's beautiful and
this is the first color chart a cherry
go ahead and swatch it for you guys oh
my god beautiful color isn't that
gorgeous whoa oh my god I'm super
impressed already know i'm gonna love
these i tries have to pick out tons and
tons of lip products you guys right now
because honestly I did not do a lip
product declutter and I don't plan on
doing one until next year just for
personal reasons I was having a hard
time clearing out like my lip stuff like
I honestly just didn't really want to
clear it out which is bad but I'm sure
my next year I'll be fine doing it so I
do have all of my lip products by the
way I have a beauty room tour a video
coming up on friday where you guys will
see what I'm doing with my beauty room
was thus far there's still a few things
that are missing from my whole room as a
whole but as a whole my whole room as a
whole there are a few things that are
missing still I brought a new chair for
like the make up your attic area like
the vanity area
what not but what I was going to say was
I all of my lip products all of them my
lip balms my lipsticks my lip gloss is
everything on the little like desk area
everything fits on there so if I keep
buying lip products it's not going to
fit on there so that's my goal is to not
have to open up another drawer and put
more lip products ins so the next one is
a 363 hickory smoked again another one
of their matte lip pencils and this
looks gorgeous too they look a little
lighter than what like this color is at
the top I will say but this looks really
really beautiful so there is hickory
smoked and yeah I do you guys see that
it looks a little darker like the
packaging looks darker than the actual
swatch so maybe that's something that
you want to be aware of and then the
other two that I got our let's see here
this one is called 83 66 barry tales
like fairy tales but barry tales it's
really really cute and this one's just a
beautiful kind of berry pink color I
don't know how it's going to swatch
though against watching a lot lighter
hmm I was kind of hoping these we're
going to be exactly what they looked
like you guys see how much darker that
is then how its watched that's a little
disappointing but this formula looks
like it's definitely going to be
promising so I'm okay with it and then I
picked up one that I'll probably wear
injured will allow wear during the
springtime but um this is like not it's
definitely out of my comfort zone I'm
not someone who loves tons and tons of
new colors or like purple colors or like
lilac colors but I am trying to get out
of my comfort zone so this one is called
8 365 lie lack like lidl ack kind of
cute and this packaging is not coming
off I'm sorry but this is what it looks
like it's a beautiful just like that
color and it's coming off more pink when
I swatch it but it's really pretty so
those are the new wet'n'wild matte lip
pencils and i'll keep you guys updated
on those alright the next thing I picked
up was the caress passionate spell fine
fragrance elixirs body wash this is a
mix of passion fruit and fiery orange
rose and I heard so many things about
this from my friend out Ellis for living
here on YouTube she talks about this all
the time and says it's a very like
seductive warm scent and it really does
smell good it really smells good so I'm
excited to try this out I've never tried
anything from Chris so I thought this
would be fun and then I picked up a few
little k-cups you can really brand them
these are from Lipton I've never seen
the green tea k-cups so this is a little
tree pack to try out they have chamomile
mint other natural flavors in it like
spearmint rose hips orange peel hibiscus
I'm excited to try it out you guys know
I'm a huge tea lover I also went ahead
and picked up two deep conditioners i
picked up the Pantene pro-v three minute
miracle repair &amp;amp; Protect deep
conditioner it is a miracle conditioning
for damaged or weak hair this is what it
looks like I really like this in a
little squeezy tube and then I picked up
one that was in a little like what is
this little bucket bucket it's in a
little jar basically this is the l'oreal
everpure sulfate free repair remedy mask
I've never tried this one it says it
repairs and recovers strength and
defends color brilliance so we shall see
I want to not I'm d nonsense oh oh it
smells like a men's deodorant but not
like a sexy men's deodorant kind of
Legos even wearing that deodorant if a
couple hours sort of I don't know I
don't know about that sent that may be a
deal-breaker for me because I'm huge on
sense all right oh sorry another makeup
item the wet and wild photo focus vapora
center and affixed yells in French I
think the hardest Utah to fix him this
is basically just a photo focus settings
bread sorry i was literally trying to
say the french word in english but
anyway this is their photo focused
setting spray is supposed to kind of
like blur imperfections and my friend
Nelly I'm going to lick her channel
below she said this is amazing so I'm
excited to try this i'm all about those
settings braids that really do think
they prolonged aware of your makeup so
i'm excited to try that and then i also
picked up the marc anthony hydrating
coconut with shea butter sulfate free
dry styling oil i do not have a
I styling oil I thought it would be nice
when I'm wearing my hair natural which
is just down and straight to kind of
spray a little bit on the ends just so
they look a little more pretty and not
so like me you know like lick lick lick
little spider legs because I'm starting
to like the longer my hair gets the more
i get with more split ends and I'm going
to see my stylist sooner she'll probably
take off about half an inch but for the
most part like my ends tend to get a
little sprout way that make sense their
little like me so I don't really like
that so I thought that a dry styling oil
would be nice and obviously not going to
spray this anywhere near my roots
because I'm someone who has fine
slippery oily hair already and I just
don't want it to look even more oily
that's why I was always scared to try
these but um I love the marc anthony
coconut oil and shea butter duo like
their little a deep conditioner mask
it's amazing so this is the one that I
picked up I'm excited to try it out and
then I picked up two sets of makeup
removing cleansing wipes I haven't tried
this one this is from clean and clear
these are the makeup dissolving facial
cleansing ways they instantly dissolve
dirt oil and makeup even waterproof
mascara these were just 244 so I picked
up two of the little ones and I'll let
you guys know how those work and then
let's see here oh there's another makeup
item do you may say it was going to do
all the makeup even priests ok ok about
that um wet'n'wild repackaged their
blushes and I already have all of their
blushes but I do not have this one it is
in 326 be and it is rose a champagne so
that sounds very similar to their
highlighting not they're highlighting
palette the fergie roses champagne glow
which I guess somebody told me that they
are getting rid of the fergie line
through wet'n'wild which is kind of
disappointing because I really love the
highlighters from that line but there
are I don't know there's a lot like in
there like in the packaging so I'm sure
that I won't get it through it too
quickly but that's kind of disappointing
I really thought the Freddie line was
nice so I don't know if she cut ties
with them or if they don't want to work
with her anymore i'm not quite sure but
this is the new rose a champagne and
this is the blush so let's go ahead and
swatch that it really is finely milled
and gorgeous it's just a beautiful kind
of tan color it looks really nice i'm
excited to try this
seems quite pigmented and it is right
there so I'm excited to try that um it
does have a lot of finely milled little
silver and gold shimmers in there all
right all right now I want to talk about
something let me get these swatches off
I yesterday was it in my allure baby box
or the glossy backs I think of it yeah
allora beauty box I got a natural
deodorant like nice little sample size
of a natural deodorant and then a lot of
people were asking the comments section
could you let us know where could you
make a video on the national do right
I'm all about not putting aluminum on my
armpits even though i do pretty much
every single day i really really like um
deodorants that are either the spray
form which is not good to inhale and
also they have aluminum in them but also
i really really like um the ones that
have like the clear gel just because
they don't leave white marks I hate
white marks underneath perfect so anyway
everybody was asking could you keep us
updated and let us know if that natural
deodorant works for you and kind of on
the hunt to like looking for basically
I'm on the hunt for a deodorant that is
all-natural doesn't have aluminum that
works really well that doesn't leave
underarm like um wetness underarm like
white rings and also I want one that
smells good so I went ahead and picked
up two other a natural deodorants um
while i was at walgreens just so that i
can make a video on a minute call it
like a battle of the you know natural
deodorants or something like that so
this is the toms no aluminum this is the
24 hour odor protection long lasting
deodorant it is unscented it did not
realize it was unscented but that's okay
uh I have tried Tom's products before I
really like their toothpaste like their
apricot toothpaste but I have not heard
good things about this one but of course
I want to try it out for myself so this
is the first one and then the second one
I picked up I have some good things
about this this is the natural
protection crystal body deodorant
roll-on a typo allergenic fragrance and
paraben free and has no aluminum in it
as well so i'm going to try those out
too and i will give you guys my opinion
to my thoughts on natural deodorants and
which one is the best in about a month
or so so anyway that is my little
drugstore haul i'm sorry if i'm kind of
rare
through this video I've had a really
really good day today and I know is to
spend one of those days where lots of
little fun surprises we're happening all
over this place and I can't help but be
no really overly bubbly mood so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video I will
probably have that get ready with me
video going up either later today or
tomorrow or something like that and yeah
I hope you guys enjoyed thank you so
much fun oops I keep the camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
