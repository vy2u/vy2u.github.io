you so much for joining me i hope you
are having a wonderful friday so far i
have a drugstore makeup haul collab to
share with you guys in this video and
i'm very very excited this is actually a
collab with a new friend of mine here on
youtube her name is lisa and i really
really adore her channel she's very
pretty she works at sephora and she
posts good content so i'm gonna go ahead
and leave her channel link down below so
that you guys can go follow her tell her
I say hello go check out her video as
well and yeah she reached out to me and
asked if I wanted to do a collab and I
said absolutely so anyway I picked up
some items from the drugstore
specifically ulta that I wanted to share
with you guys everything is makeup
related except for one item but let's go
ahead and start with the samples first
so the first sample that I got I really
want to dig into this this is the
ultimate avoid isaac body lotion with
shea butter aloe and vitamins A B 5 C
and E but the scent is nectarine rose
and you guys know anything rose I love
so I'm super super excited to try this
out you might see this in next month's
um was I gonna say sample spotlight
video and then I also got a sample of
the acute phase born this way naturally
a radiant concealer which you guys know
I already have a full size of this I
absolutely adore this particular
concealer and I also got a sample of the
Smashbox photo finish foundation primer
and that is what it looks like so anyway
let's go ahead and get started on the
items that i actually purchased i was
really wanting to purchase like new
items from the drug store but then I
realized that I just wasn't really that
into what I was seeing there was a bunch
of new stuff from Maybelline where it
was like a contouring and highlighting
stick in one it's just like some
interesting products but I was like I
don't know if I'm actually going to use
those so I ended up just picking up the
necessities things that I love and that
I need the first two items are this
little to miracle complexion sponge kit
from Real Techniques you guys know I am
absolutely obsessed with these miracle
complexion sponge a--'s they are in my
opinion so so so much better than the
Beauty Blender I feel like they don't
soak up as much product they're much
softer and what I like about them is
that they have that flat edge so that
you really can beat your face really
really quickly with your foundation so I
absolutely
Bluett I cannot speak you guys I
absolutely absolutely adore these and
you guys know that so I did pick up
another little kids of those and the
next item that I picked up is a new
physicians formula butter bronzer or at
least it's new to me it says new on the
packaging but you guys know that i
picked up the other sheet which is
called light bronzer about two or three
weeks ago i am obsessed with that
bronzer so i went ahead and got the
other one this one is just called
bronzer and i don't think there's really
that much of a difference between the
two of them the shades look pretty darn
similar but i just love the formulation
on these they gave a really nice kind of
like late satiny finish to the skin and
i think they're just so so so beautiful
and they smell amazing so anyways this
one is supposedly lighter when you
swatch it next to the other one I should
have taken the other one out so I could
do a little comparison but yeah this is
the butter bronzer the murumuru butter
bronzer and it's just the shade bronzer
this is what it looks like and I don't
know looking at this I feel like this is
actually a little more cool tones than
the other one but they're so smooth and
buttery and beautiful so there is and
here it is swatched on the back of my
hand I just love the formulation on
these butter bronzers so really happy to
a pick that up and it smells absolutely
amazing the next two items that I picked
up were makeup setting spray so I really
like the elf makeup setting sprays and
also these ones from NYX I've gone
through probably three or four each of
these this one is the dewy finish
long-lasting setting spray and then this
one is the match finished long-lasting
setting spray both of them are really
really good quality you guys I feel like
not a lot of people talk about the next
ones or the elf ones i mean i feel like
people talk about the elf one but i
really feel like they're very good
quality so i would say these ones are a
little better than the elf ones and i
would say they're definitely like
comparable to high end makeup setting
spray so if you do not want to spend
like twenty two dollars on an urban
decay one or the skin to navy or one or
whatever i would highly recommend
checking out these ones from NYX they're
very very similar what I like to do is
anytime that I want to be really glowy I
will use the dewy finish one and I spray
it on before my primer and then after I
have done all of my makeup and same
thing with the mad one I spray it on
before my primer as well I just feel
like with setting sprays using it as
like an extra primer as well really
helps to adhere the makeup to your face
so I really really enjoy both of those
and then
nice like oh my god I have heard so many
people talking about this is the navel
II New York superstay better skin skin
transforming powder they shade that I
picked up is number 10 porcelain and
this is salicylic acid in it which is
quite interesting so anyway it says it's
our first powder with salicylic acid
that wears all day it improves skins
look reduces the appearance of
imperfections ports and unevenness and
it is dermatologist tested for safety
and non comedogenic so anyway this is
what the actual packaging looks like
this packaging is amazing beautiful i
really liked the white packaging you
open it up you have a huge mirror which
is also really really cool you have a
little sponge and then there is the
actual powder so here's just a little
sponge and probably won't use that but i
have heard amazing amazing things about
this particular powder it feels really
really soft to the touch and it's that
kind of powder that like doesn't really
kick up that much product when you rub
your finger in there so anyway let me
see if i can do a little swatch for you
guys so there it is it looks like it's
maybe like a shade darker than my skin
tone but i definitely don't mind i'm
super excited to try this out and i'm
going to kind of use it just to set in
my makeup i don't think it really gives
that much coverage but i'm excited to
try it out sorry i thought i was
smelling something it's the Muro Muro
butter brother anyway um but it doesn't
have a scent or anything like that but i
like that has salicylic acid in it I
guess I would stay away if you do have
dry skin since that's probably going to
make your skin a little more dry than it
is also sells well I guess that is nice
because it does help to exfoliate this
game so very very excited to try that
out and then the next item that I got
was another one of the Maybelline
instant age rewind eraser dark circle
treatments now I love these and I talked
about this in like my Holy Grail makeup
video I get the brightener shade which
is the pink one now a lot of people
don't like this particular one because
they think it looks so pink but I don't
like the fair version or like the
lightest shade because it's actually too
dark on my skin so I like to put this
underneath my eyes I like to do the
little V and then I put it on my eyelids
I'll put it on my chin down the bridge
of my nose and a little bit on my
forehead
I just feel like a really really
brightens up nicely i use it with a damp
Real Techniques sponge and I just love
this product I've gone through I think
seven of these in total since they came
out so I've been using these for a while
really really like that one and like I
said the brightener version is very very
pink so if you don't have like a cool
undertone in your skin it might not look
as good as it would on someone who does
have a cool undertone but for me I
really really like the way that that
looks like i said the original one like
the fair version or whatever is too
yellow and too dark on my skin so I
don't like it all right and then the
last three items that I got are setting
powders these are some holy grail
setting powders so the first one is the
elf tone correcting powder in cool you
guys know I've been talking about this
for ages and I'm so excited that Alta is
selling elf now they're also selling
estee lauder and also bh cosmetics which
i think is awesome so anyway this is
just a four color tone correcting powder
it's so finely milled and beautiful and
if you do have a cool undertone even if
you don't have a cool undertone I still
think this would work just make sure you
use kind of a lighter hand but it's so
beautiful so finely milled and you guys
know I go through setting powder like I
drink water or both your water actually
I don't drink that much water but you
guys know what I mean I don't throw it
very quickly um I also picked up another
one of the essence as the essences thank
you talk to me is all about Matt fixing
compact powders you guys know I also
love this setting powder it's not as
good as the elf one but it is cheaper
and I do go through these again very
very quickly it does keep you mad all
day long really like this during the
summer time for my combo to oily skin
and the final powder that I picked up is
one of my favorites as well it's not my
all-time favorite but it's still pretty
good this is the Rimmel London stay
matte long-lasting pressed powder I get
these shades 001 transparent and a lot
of people are like Olivia's just
transparent but I swear to you this has
a little bit of a yellow tinge to it I
do have quite a cool undertone in my
skin so when I put this on I really do
actually notice it I know a lot of
people are like no it's not there it's
completely invisible but I swear has a
little bit of a yellow tint to it but
anyway I picked that up as well and this
one and the essence and also the elf are
very very cheap all under five dollars
where is this nate believe superstay
better skin which I guess I probably
will use to set in my makeup as well was
like around ten dollars even with life
we know did I get yeah I got one of them
fifty percent off but this was like
originally ten dollars which is quite
pricey but anyway that is everything
that I got I hope you guys will go over
and check out Lisa's channel I like i
said i will leave it down below and yeah
i will definitely do a follow-up all for
you guys in about a week and yeah i will
see you guys later tonight bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
