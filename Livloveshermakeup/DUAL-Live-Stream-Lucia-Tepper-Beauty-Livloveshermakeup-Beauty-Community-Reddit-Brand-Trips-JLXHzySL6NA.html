is a lot of people are not I feel like
here in the United States we kind of
think of you know gypsy is being like
free-spirited and because gypsy soul uh
you know I didn't mean anything
of course yeah so it is what it is I'm
not taking the video down cuz I still
wanted people to be able to see it but
yeah read it to my ass
I usually like read it I will say there
are a few people to get a little
nitpicky but for the most part I feel
like they have really really good
constructive criticism to give if you
want that website whereas like other
websites what is it called guru guru
gossiper mm-hmm people are crazier oh
yeah I seen a couple posts about me on
reddit but I stay far away no okay yeah
well told me that they're like being
mean and I was like we're really okay
well sometimes it's really really
constructive in my opinion but then
sometimes people get a little nitpicky
yeah someone said what beauty what
beauty youtubers do you think are the
most dishonest they unsubscribe canceled
they all are horrible as you get bigger
I feel like a lot of people hit that
five hundred thousand mark or like you
know nine hundred thousand one no and
then you know they're quitting their
jobs and then they're going to all these
events and then anything they ever talk
about is PR all the time and then I'm
glad they're just taking sponsorships
and then they just kind of turn into
sellout machines yeah I think that like
the two people that come to my mind
Jacqueline Hill I don't think she's
dishonest I just think she loves
everything and there's no way you can
love that many things it's not possible
like at least for me so I and then also
like kathleenlights she's one of the
only Beauty big people I still subscribe
to purely for entertainment I think she
like is a nice person she's too nice
she's very very to mut nice like if she
gets PR and she reviews something she's
like oh well this wasn't my favorite but
who knows maybe I'll like it once I
don't like know
no that was awful you know that was
awful don't say you might like in the
future like and that's true for some
things but it's everything and even when
she does a disappointing products video
she can never say the words like I
didn't like this it's always like oh
this one what I didn't not not like it
yeah like this one this one isn't my
favorite and I'm like you can say you
didn't like it like you're allowed to
say that okay
yeah I say it all the time yeah and I
love people bring up the topic of you
know you will only grow so far because
it's a certain you know niche I guess
you could say here on YouTube so being a
little more opinionated although that is
a little more popular right now I think
they always say that there's like a
limit that your channel will grow so I
think I'm not interesting it but again
it's not always just about the numbers
and things like that you know it's
important to see other things okay here
let me read the chat what do you think
of Lauren made beauty we both love her
she's amazing she's amazing I like
kathleenlights but she should have
apologized on youtube for saying the N
word see that is that I felt like was
was bad but a lot of people were
comparing my situation to hers and I
didn't yeah that's that's what's going
on on reddit they were comparing that
you know that was a slur and what she
did was a slur and I have to agree and I
did not chime in on my reddit thread but
if people are watching this video you
know I honestly thought it was slang I
didn't think it was a straight-up slur I
would never do something like that I've
been very outspoken um you know about
things like this so I don't know why
people would think that way about me but
it is what it is
all right let's see she did a
sponsorship to a first impressions of
the Marc Jacobs foundation wait that was
because she didn't talk well about that
okay or maybe someone said I mean she
ignored it as if it never happens oh
okay
yeah kathleenlights yeah you know and I
kind of ignored the situation for the
the little canvas thing but I didn't
think it was a serious but
people have different you know levels of
what they think is serious and what is
it so you know you can't please
everybody
you can't you just have to go with what
feels best video someone said what
advice do you both have for new
youtubers one thing you're starting my
own channel I'm not sure if I would get
judged my advice would be I have a
couple of Imus a couple things my first
thing is just do it like you can think
about it all you want but it's one of
those things where you only learn from
doing and so if you want to do a channel
you're not gonna be I know this person
said like I'm worried about being judged
first of all not that many people are
gonna find it at first so like even if
you are judge like we both are that
comes years later it kind of nerves
later but then they will go back to your
first videos if you like oh my god
you've seen I leave all my old videos up
it is a cringe but I need you but I was
trying to be like other people so I was
like I was trying so hard because there
were there weren't people like us that
we're talking about this kind of thing
and now that there are and there's like
Stephanie Nicole and you know all these
people really kind of started this trend
then you feel you feel okay doing that
yeah and my other advice would be to
like our channels be original because I
like Liv said when we started we were
trying like I want I don't know about
you I wanted to be a big beauty guru and
so I was doing favorites videos and like
first impressions even though I was 16 I
could not afford to like do big stuff so
I was buying a lot of drugstore makeup
but if you have original idea go for it
don't worry about like if someone's
gonna judge you because people now
because of the how fake the beauty
givers are they're craving people like
us and I think that's why you know in
January I had 1000 subscribers and so I
think that is taken off and I think it's
so cool I think it's you know the
problem about the beauty community too
is that no matter where you are in the
beauty community there is a lot of
competitive people and so you want to
make friends with obviously people that
are in competitive it
not what you're trying to do is so for
me I find that there's friendships that
are just like okay we just talked to
each other about videos and then there's
actual friendships like Samantha I
always get asked all the time or you
look Samantha actually friends yes we
are actually friends just like how Lucy
and I are friends you know so you know
there's different levels of friendship
on YouTube and some people just want it
so that they can bounce off each other's
channels and then other people just want
to be friends for real so live did a
reaction video yeah wouldn't that be
great we she who is she I have a YouTube
channel but gets a book channel and I
haven't posted a video in a two years I
am just too shy and my anxiety gets yeah
you know I don't know what do you think
about that Lucia cuz for me I always I
always felt somewhat comfortable on
camera but not like full comfortable at
least not the first year um I have been
on YouTube actually for six years I was
on three years okay I didn't know you've
been on longer than me yeah so I was on
I had a singing channel for three years
and I think that that made me initially
comfortable with you too but then I
started talking on this channel and I
didn't talk on my sing channel I just
saying and it definitely takes a long
time but like I said you just got to do
it like practice makes perfect it's
never gonna come unless you do it right
absolutely
yeah yeah it's so true alright asking
someone's asking hide request from me
how did your classmates react when your
channel took off I was wondering that
the other day um I mean a lot of people
don't know because I'm not like hi I'm a
youtuber like that's not a booty go
round bow down to me be calm but
everyone who well not everyone but the
majority of people who did know we're
just so so supportive and I know a lot
of my old friends from high school and
middle school like reached out to me and
they were like Lucia I just wanted to
say like I this is so amazing your
channel is taken off someone said to me
who have
since I was in kindergarten she was like
I always knew you'd do great things and
I was like oh thanks really sweet yeah
it's nice and people are supportive and
I feel like after being on YouTube for
two or three years there are some people
that are super supportive and then other
people that want nothing to do with my
channel which is totally understandable
so ya know but that's cool your channel
did go up I will say I think it's
amazing I had so many people writing
like Lucia Lucia and I'm like oh yes oh
that's cool so you came from like other
people yes huh I think people were
writing your name in a video on I can't
what video was but one of your videos
had just gone viral and they were like
watch this video she's so good and I was
like let me see if John check is
cancelled
I'm over it too she's done yeah the halo
beauty thing was interesting I mean I
just thought she would come out with
something that wasn't pink pepto-bismol
pills that's all yep not much - babe
what do you think of all the plastic
surgery and fillers that big a beauty
I'm sorry big booty gurus again while
still promoting so much and makeup do
you believe it's wrong because it
creates an unattainable sense of beauty
I mean listen I'm all for people doing
whatever they want with their body I
personally haven't had plastic surgery
but I would never ever ever shame
someone who did it's false advertising
um maybe if they're doing like a
under-eye concealer where tests and say
they have like Botox or whatever you get
under here fillers maybe that's a little
bit of false advertising but I wouldn't
say that you know then just putting on
makeup just because they have Botox or
they've gotten their nose done that
doesn't mean that you know they're not
being authentic I don't see any - what
do you think with yeah yeah I mean it's
funny my boyfriend we're talking about
this yesterday the only issue that I
have is if you are shamed into doing it
like if you feel like you have to but I
know like everyone comes after the
people who get lip fillers or do this
and do that and I think that we
shouldn't shame them we just have to
keep in mind that if someone does have
fillers and there's
skin looks better than you yeah their
skin is gonna look better than you
because they have these fillers and like
I think it needs to be kept in mind that
you know it's not something you're gonna
achieve by buying the concealer they're
putting on because that's not how it
happened right right
yep no that makes sense live what's your
favorite brush for buffing in
highlighter
I love the Luxy 522 tapered highlighter
brush really really good really good
stuff um I think it is false advertising
when advertising for talkies pills
though yeah you know I mean I know that
she has she has extensions right her
hair she has a lot although what she has
is that her natural hair because it's
 blessed okay that's great but
you know she's she's talked about having
some work done here and there and she
gets her nails done she goes in for
facials and stuff like that so I guess I
wasn't really expecting like I don't
want to see skin care from her because
she gets all that done professionally
the pills I didn't want to see either
because you know it's like oh it's gonna
help my nails grow but your nails are
fake like how does that work I don't
understand
someone said sorry this is only for me
not for you let's see how'd you grow
your channel so quickly um well it
wasn't quick it's been three years right
here yesterday was the three-year
anniversary actually so but I get what
you mean it happened all at once
yeah the video products people buy that
they know won't work for them on
February 7th I looked at the data that
day the amount of watch time for that
one day for that one video was one year
and a hundred days oh my gosh crazy haha
yeah it's crazy when one of your videos
does go viral I remember you were saying
the two faces that chocolate chip
palette review I was just like what it
came out of nowhere
and he gets so many people that come in
and it's great it's great and then
YouTube sees that you know you have a
big video and they promote you even more
so it's a good you know you don't ride
that well you have it for sure she has
tensions and a bougie skincare oh yeah
hockey yeah and I again I don't care I
don't care that she's had work done I
just I was disappointed with the pills
I would have liked to see makeup like a
good foundation or something um let's
see here live I found you from Too Faced
chocolate chip oh yeah yeah if you went
on a brand trip with other youtubers
would you want to be oh I don't
understand I think you say who would you
want to be with who I mean for a brand
trip like which brand are people I think
what I think the question was other
people other people I would take Lucia
with me yeah um definitely Samantha
Lauren like that whole little group you
know yeah for sure for sure but I don't
think any brand is going to bring us
that little group there never happened
ever
especially me but yeah no I don't really
think I don't know if any of us will get
invited for brand trips you know I don't
think so
I don't think so would you ever get more
pets live yes I want them all live are
you meeting up with Samantha when she is
in Arizona she's actually at the Grand
Canyon today so no no I know I'm kind of
sad about that I love you both doing
this y'all are the last two Beauty
people I ever watched I used to have 30
plus and I'm down to ten good for you oh
yeah good for you for decluttering that
subscription feed I think I watched all
of the group oh yeah the group that
sounds that sounds kind of clicky I
shouldn't say but you guys know going
talking about yeah I actually I'm not
very familiar with Samantha's videos I
have to go subscribe I've heard her will
I buy it videos are amazing she was like
fun to do those and she's very sweet but
she's very honest she's the sweetest
person just like a really good
person like I think you would like no
she's commented on one of my videos but
I don't know I just
Samantha someone said love you Lucia you
guys seemed so down to earth what do you
think is the most
rated product this past year or
something overrated products oh you're
so far hmm I know mine what has been a
huge fail on 2018 that released in 2008
unicorns there see I only wanted to say
it if I've tried the product Apple yeah
I am talking all about I'm good I'm
good uh y'all are my favorite youtubers
this is so cool yeah yeah yeah this is
fun this is fun but ya know I think it
will be interesting to see where your
channel goes I think it's gonna be great
I can you're gonna have a ton of
subscribers and I really hope that there
will someday be a big big channeling you
know like 1 million 2 million and that
talks about the kind of stuff that you
talk about that would be crazy like I
hope you know if not us than somebody
like I is some I got these comments
saying like the anti-consumerism
revolution is coming and I was like god
I hope so
I don't know if I'm really part of that
though I mean you are because you
question things like even though stuff
like you don't have to be like me also
not buy stuff but you make videos of you
know questioning things and like why are
certain things like this and that that
makes you because these big people they
don't do that ever
hello they want that yar and they want
that money for sponsorships yeah so when
asked what do I study I am a television
radio major with a minor in theater Amy
who is this person this is Lucia and
she's amazing and you need to go right
to her yes please jump on the Natasha -
no no bad question they want you to jump
on the agenda no bandwagon yeah we don't
okay when you said that I actually
didn't I like go to the comments as I'm
watching videos if I am like wanting to
like know what's going on
and I got too excited so I got to the
comment and I saw that comment I was
laughing so hard I was like I wish I had
just waited till you said it it's just
ridiculous I mean her prices are crazy
and I understand I will buy the $80
hourglass palette but that's as high as
I will
I cannot purchase a pallet over $100
like I can't do it yeah I'm trying to
think the most expensive I feel like I
mean I purchased the Naked palette like
when I was very young I saved up for it
but the most expensive thing I've
purchased any time recently was the
Fenty beauty in primer but I did that
during the Beauty Insider sale in the
fall okay but like I said college
student college student yeah yeah
exactly I remember those days I remember
those days
lúcia I found you through project pay
and live I found you through files on
how the Grails there you go there you go
there needs to be a more transparency
and criticism in makeup brands and the
products they are releasing to the
public
yeah I agree Oh someone said who are
your favorite smaller youtubers I just
my most recent video is a whole video
just talking about my favorite small
youtubers so if you want more people to
subscribe to they're all wonderful
people I can you subscribe to them I
enjoyed that list I thought that was a
good list it was very good okay let's
see oh by the way are you liking the
hush palettes eye they're coming
tomorrow I still haven't gotten them
marvelous that's crazy well I personally
have been enjoying the bad habit pallets
I didn't have like super high
expectations but my expectations are
high just because I watched so many
videos and everyone seems to really like
they're not that good I don't know
they're not bootie guru good okay but
they're good they're yeah you're not
like oh my god it's the best thing ever
you don't know but I'm excited yeah have
you tried like have you used all of the
ones that they how many did they send
unto you so they told me that I could
take 15 to 20 and then 10 add-on items
and I ended up just picking I think
total from the website like 13 so I got
10 pallets no yet 10 and then three
others so I picked up like the ones that
everybody wanted me to review like the
Athena which is really really pretty
I've been pairing that together with the
Urban Decay backtalk this week and I
really like the eye looks I'll be
getting and then the cooler tone Paula's
are good you'll see you'll see I mean
the shimmers are a little lob they're
thin and they're hard to pack
to the lid and you really have to wait
file down your brush however the mats
are super super buttery very blendable
very blendable the bad habit pilots are
surprisingly good yeah I agree I agree I
love this interaction
I'm from such a small place I love being
able to chat to you guys which year what
are you studying go ahead let him know
television radio major minor in theater
that's one of the most questions I get
all the time I feel like I've answered
your life's dream all the time you
should put it in your you should have
like a FAQ section I should it I should
put something like that together I think
people would like that I have a dose of
colors I'm wearing they're lippy for the
first time today well I have have you
know I haven't tried most things like
but the majority of stuff cuz I said I
don't buy stuff the majority and that's
why I'm excited to get PR because I can
review more stuff without crying because
I'm a color students right exactly and I
feel like you've established yourself as
a very honest person so it shouldn't be
an issue yeah so you know if people have
an issue they have an issue whatever it
is what it is yeah move on all right
let's see Lucia what school do you
attend those questions awesome thanks
for answering someone said what either
of you not want to be above a certain
sub Kat I know the intimacy between subs
and other youtubers to be different in a
larger channel I was gonna sound bad but
I never thought that my channel will go
over 50,000 and I think I was
disappointed slightly that's awesome
it's very bad I think I was a little
disappointed when I hit 20,000 because I
wasn't able to answer every single
comment anymore up until 20,000 every
single comment every single post I would
answer everything and it just kind of
felt like I was losing a part of the
relationship there but you know people
kept coming back and I love that you
have the little hearts icon now so you
can show people that you saw their
comments I think that's really that's
good I wish I had as much time to check
my comments nowadays what I don't yeah
for me I have a totally opposite
response since I was so so small first
so long I just like I hope to grow more
and I'm so excited for the people that
are coming and I know the answer is no I
really hope and I have no idea like I
could stop growing tomorrow or I could
continually I have no idea but my hope
is to get to 50 like that's my hope
because you know eventually it will
start to slow down but right now it's
slowing down but it's still going and so
like fingers crossed but who knows what
will happen yeah yeah no I think that's
great
I mean it's good to set goals I try to
not set any number goals anything like
that when it comes to you - because I
just it's not worth it for me but also I
think you kind of set yourself up for a
little bit of like you know you don't
want to be upset if you never hit that
number and I think I've seen some old
like og youtubers recently talking about
this hmm excuse me choke me on my own
saliva I've seen a few people talking
about that where they said you know I
used to get all these views and I had
this expectation of what it would be
like but then you know he can't stay
relevant forever yeah and nobody will I
won't
lutea won't nobody will there will
always be someone else that comes in and
they'll just kind of swoop them down you
know so I think it's important to be
realistic with your channel as well but
I see your channel getting really like
big I hope you get to a million and then
you can represent for all of us yes I
don't think that's happening well thank
you for saying this no I think if people
are sick of content hauls and first
impressions so we want new content like
what y'all put out yeah
like I said the little group of the
people we were talking about earlier
like Angelica and Samantha and Lauren I
think and Lucci and I we all put out a
different content but it's kind of
within the same realm so Angelica what
is I want to subscribe to her what is he
oh my god her eye looks I'm so good as
I've seen her videos before but yeah
she's Swedish what's her name
it's Angelica and then how do you spell
her last name I think it's n why let me
look it up I have it here I should know
I'm Swedish but oh why Q V is P she's
amazing she's great there you go so
let me read here um do you watch LS I do
and I know you do yeah exactly I
actually found both of you around the
same time I'm watching there for years
waiting before my channel was any you
know I don't even know yeah yeah because
I've been yeah I yeah I think it's at
least two years very cool very cool I
love al yes you do too you're gonna love
Angelica yeah you are going to love her
I like the video that I've seen I don't
know why I did that happens where I'll
find someone I like oh cool and that I
don't like remember to subscribe or
something yeah well YouTube is so weird
because they unsubscribe you from
channels and they're like do you want
notifications are only partial
notifications I'm like what does that
even mean like I don't want to know like
once in a while when they pose that
seems weird Oh someone wants to know do
you speak any other languages I'm
scrolling a little factors you know I
can read Hebrew but I don't speak
anything um how you know a youtuber lies
in an opinion kisses from Spain how do
you know if a youtuber is lying you
don't you don't you don't they all lie
you really don't you just have to go
with your gut feeling you will never
know because we edit and we look at
everything and we show you what we want
to show you so you know I know a lot of
you guys trust both of us and I mean I
don't when I'm on YouTube I have no
reason to be I don't just you know make
money on here and that's my full-time
job there's no reason to but yeah it's
hard to tell I mean it's easy to tell
because a lot of them are not like
creative showing it you know it's very
obvious that they're not you know but it
can be it can be difficult you just
gotta go with your gut feeling I don't
know what else to say
alright let's see so instead what kind
of videos do you guys watch other than
make up ones do you watch any other than
make up you watch MOOC bonds right yeah
an ASMR that's more I like ASMR i watch
a lot of music
related videos so I need those and then
also Oh like vegan channels oh my god
yeah yeah like live B oh my god she
makes amazing like unhealthy vegan food
I dig it
yeah so I would say mostly makeup and
then Oh animal videos oh god I should
just be an animal channel
my whole subscription is just like cute
animals you guys real well real lutea
how does your dorm and they feel about
your YouTube videos he thinks it's cool
she doesn't really say that much about
it
um but yeah she thinks it's cool and she
always gives me the room when I need to
film so that's nice right yeah perfect
roommate there you go um let's see
someone said true crime I love
supernatural I love true crime that's
why I'm gonna integrate some of those
videos onto my channel and I know it's
been a difficult transition the past
couple of weeks oh my gosh I've had
people unsubscribe and then free
subscribe and then people being upset
about the videos that's so clicking on
them and so you know yeah I think it's
hard when you establish yourself as like
I'm only doing makeup and then you
decide that you want to do something
else but I can't help it I got bored you
know when you're boring you try
different things
what could the camera do you use to film
in your dorm I have the listed like in
every description box I have the camera
and the lighting listed I don't oh wait
it's the sony a5100 the new content yeah
tomorrow I'm gonna be talking about the
time a so called fan called Animal
Control on me yeah
it came to my place in Milwaukee and I
was like this is the joke so that's
gonna be tomorrow's video hopefully I'm
God you guys know I'm always talking
about what video should i film today and
then I go look at my list I'm like I'm
so overwhelmed we were talking about
that how we have long video lists and
things like that and it's very
interesting when people say they can't
come up with content you know if you've
been on YouTube for 10 years I get it
but if you're brand new
like you can literally make videos about
everything you know without going on to
a different route and talking about
other things and are not be related even
though I don't know oh I know you don't
like doing tutorials you should live
should I do it voiceover style like a
true booty girl I like my look of the
week videos where I do a get ready with
me because I never wanted to come across
as you have to do this now you hear me
you have to take this brush and this
brush only and work it into your
eye socket okay I wanted to be more like
if you have this brush go ahead and use
that if you have a $2.00 elf brush go
ahead and use that so I think it's
better to do get ready with nice yeah if
it makes you feel better live my
neighbor was high and angry at me and he
called animal control and said I was
starving my rabbit yeah well you guys
know me you know that I'm obsessed with
the animals I dedicate a lot of time to
animals so I was very taken aback but it
is what it is and I don't know how they
found my address too you know a whole
another thing I was like oh do we have
to do this why are people so creepy
no voiceover I know I was joking you
guys got to get a more fee code yeah
don't forget to use my way and check out
okay yes opinions on abh I love it eh
love it how do you feel about a BH I
only have the mana Renaissance palette
and the Nicole grow glow kit I like the
modern Renaissance when I got it now I
feel like I don't it got old very fast
like the the card yeah like you're not
as vibrant anymore and I don't use it as
much anymore but yeah I feel like it's
it was it's overhyped like if people
still say like this is the best pal in
the whole entire world I'm like notice
but missed out in the whole entire realm
about I personally think it's pretty
good but I if you're looking for a very
toned palette
yeah they go with that over the naked
palettes you know what I mean oh yeah oh
yeah so that's what I think of when
people ask you know what's a good berry
tone palette
save Modern Renaissance because it's
right in between you know do you want to
Jessica Braun both of us do yes I love
her um let's see here
creepy stalker types yeah there's a lot
of those favorite music artists well for
me all classical Shostakovich all day
long composer love him what about you
Lucia what do you listen to John Mayer
Halsey
ed Sheeran Troye Sivan Niall Horan Harry
Styles matt mechanical is ready I love
music I met Ed Sheeran what yeah I've
met him he was at a party at Julliard
and I ended up seeing him before he was
like famous so that was okay story time
there was no story I was like what was
that guy he was like on bed years back
you know and I feel like he just started
to get very popular within what the past
year yeah I would say like I would say
in high school cuz he toured with
Taylor's I wouldn't even know that see
nice oh man he probably was like you
don't know who I am he got popular when
I was around 13 or 14 so that was like
five years ago okay yeah he was taking
some pitch lessons at Julliard he's got
a little bit of pitch stuff by when he
sings live so it's always good you know
when you're a vocal students would use
some pitch isn't your training can't go
wrong with that can't go wrong seems
pretty well did you both start filming
with your phones Hyde choking on my
saliva today I haven't got a high
quality camera yeah I basically filmed
with like a potato when I started hahaha
literally I think I've gone through the
potato way it was horrible it was like a
dark room at like 10:00 p.m. when I was
living in Manhattan and I was going to
school and I was just kinda like and I
just put all this makeup on so you can
see me you know yeah you know what about
you wouldn't I was lucky enough my mom
is she used to be a video editor in New
York and and a DC Lee in the center -
but now she does freelance work for like
family videos in different videos so she
the equipment and so I was fortunate
enough for her to be like sure you can
use my camera but it wasn't as good as
the camera I have now but it was like
way better than what most people start
out but if you are thinking of starting
a channel use it there's nothing wrong
with using your phone I found my video
yesterday on my phone and today's video
yeah cuz I left my DSLR at my dad's
place yes you guys watch drama channels
I do I don't I do i watch a couple
Peterman Sanders rich luxe oh here for
the teeth yeah I want her to yeah how
come you don't watch drama channels um I
just don't like seeing first of all I
don't care but also I just don't like
people who just like feed into other
people's lives I think that if you want
to make it you have to have your own
content which I mean you don't have to
clearly people make it but I just like
to see people build themselves up
instead of rising from building other
people down right yeah I I didn't like
when the drama channels were talking
about you know Jacqueline Hill maybe
she's getting divorced obviously I don't
like assumptions I don't like those kind
of videos but I I like the funny ones
like rich luxe he's just he's a hoot I
love him I'm so anyway all right guys
what my dad's gonna be here soon so if
we can wrap this up here I don't know
how long we've been on how long have we
been on I don't know oh okay I hope it
was a good amount of time let's answer
some more questions my dad's gonna be
here soon oh I'm sorry he's gonna walk
through the door hey guys you watch
Kelly Gooch oh you should watch Kelly I
used to watch her I don't know again
it's another thing I don't know what
happened but you can subscribe to you
mm-hmm
yeah happen where are the ferrets they
are sleeping 41 minutes
okay 41 minutes is that enough I always
feel bad people say I talked so fast in
there like you're always done so quickly
ten minutes later ten minutes yeah I'm
gonna leave this one up for sure I think
you'll be good uh let's see what do you
think about the new two-faced natural
collection what do you think
have I already answered this I think
that they should come up with some new
ideas instead of repackaging old stuff
and pooping out unicorns
oh yeah Jared's - unicorns and
rainbows all over the place isn't he
yeah it is uh ya know used to love to
face you guys used to be such a fan and
everybody's like you always talk about
to face and how much you hate them
because I used to be such a fan they had
such a good products okay and then they
stole it - Estee Lauder and it's just
not as good anymore products are
inconsistent when you're under an
umbrella like that of a parent company
they can't watch over everybody equally
yeah so thank you for answering so many
of my comments yeah thank you for
watching guys
all right so 42 minutes all right let's
see I will have to do this again maybe
we could do that how might people at
once you could do though my god do you
think that's a thing is it I don't know
I mean I said - you know I can't be and
then I can send an invite to like ten
other people that was so cool
it's like good I'll just be talking over
each other yeah yeah yeah pretty much
