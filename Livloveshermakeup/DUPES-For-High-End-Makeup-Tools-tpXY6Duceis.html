you're not wondering because you already
saw the title of this video this is
going to be a Duke's video this is just
dupes for higher end makeup brushes
things like that these are just ones
that i found and i thought i'd share
them with you guys so we're going to
start over here right here i have my
naked basics one and then i have my
naked basics to and a palette that i
have found that is much cheaper and
basically gives me the same exact thing
same texture um you can color match you
know the certain ones from each pallet
kind of fit inside the Sonia Kashuk one
which is in the middle and that goes for
I think like ever say like fifteen
dollars and these are I believe 30
apiece so if you want to kind of have
both shades from the Naked basics one
and two go ahead and pick this up this
is wonderful I think I've actually used
these don't you Kashuk one more than I
have my naked basics so basically yeah
that just looks really really similar
when I apply them you know I it's like I
can't tell at sometimes I wonder like if
somebody asked me what do you use in
your eyes today I'm like oh was it thick
it is no was Sonia Kashuk I can't
remember but yes it is the ion neutral
palette I'm sorry I didn't say that at
the beginning this is the ion neutral
palette from Sonia Kashuk and again that
is the Naked basics 1 and naked basics
to on to the next this is my Anastasia
dip brow pomade in blonde now as you can
see neither of these match but I have
noticed something funny and this is for
you darker hair girls that are going to
be able to find a color that matches is
the texture of the pomade is very
similar to that of the color tattoos
from Maybelline so if you can find like
your color they don't really have a
blonde one but if you could find like a
deep dark you know from like the
leathers collection or something I think
that you may have a dupe on your hands
of the anastasia dipbrow also this elf
is this the eyeliner eyeshadow i shadow
the cream eyeshadows have a very similar
texture also so if you can find
something like just black or whatever um
oh I didn't do that because they they
seem very similar to me alright next
we're going to be looking at blush this
is the turn
to Amazonian clay holiday blush palette
that came out this year and I just want
to show you guys a few drugstore options
from the colors there so this really
beautiful like plum like mommy kind of
color i duped it with the elf mineral
blush and that is in wanderlust as you
can see don't want my shadow to be going
over in it and then this really hot pink
right there I've duped with the Milani
and delicioso pink and then that really
nice muted almost like tan color right
here i duped with the fit me in light
nude so I think that those really really
look similar and moving on just a little
tiny one here this is max um oh my god
I'm totally blanking right now what
carbon that's how often I don't use it
anymore this is max carbon the Duke for
it is from makeup geek it's makeup geek
corrupt this is so not better this looks
Ashley compared to that I highly highly
recommend not spending the money on the
mac one and just going ahead and getting
the makeup geek one all right over here
i have two sigma brushes i have the
kabuki angled kabuki f-86 no f-84 and
then the flat kabuki f80 and underneath
them are basically the same exact thing
except I ordered them online from
dresslink.com I'll leave a link below
and they were like seven of them for
like five dollars and they're just
they're just as good I mean all of these
are dirty right now but you can see like
I I use on their good their dupes
alright moving on to something a little
more exciting this is the naked 3
palette from urban decay everybody wants
to dupe this palette and there are quite
a lot of options out there I'm gonna
start with the kind of higher-end one
right here which is the steel up
portrait of a perfect I and then we're
just going to make our way down right
here is the revealed 2 palette from
Coastal Scents really really similar
that top row is really really really
similar and then even cheaper than that
see forever 21 palette right here and
then even cheaper than that we have the
maybelline a little quad in what is this
design our chocolates and then the
cheapest and a most amazing is this
profusion palette that really has those
like pinky tones in it really really
gorgeous and that's only like a couple
of dollars i believe it was 299 on the
alte website so look for the Barry bloom
so those are some dupes for the naked 3
let's move on to the regular naked
because that is something that people
want to do also the first one which one
is the most expensive it would have to
be the regular the revealed so this is
the by the way this is the naked and
here is the revealed one and they're
very very similar textures are similar I
like this one more and then over here we
have the elf I think this is like a I
think it's called I'm gonna lift it up
so similar though my god to shave in
here I like do you see that like they're
so similar anyway let me love it back of
course no sticker hmm all right forget
it um but if you go on there and you
look under pallets you can find this
like I think it's called neutral or like
natural I something like that but it
really really embodies the Naked palette
very well so it gives you all those
colors and more in my opinion over
here's another little elf palette it's
not completely you know complete
complete dupe but you can see that some
colors really do show up and you know
it's lighter and smaller than this big
clunky thing and then I just wanted to
throw this in here because this is one
of the Knicks trios this is in bossa
nova if you put that right there those
colors they totally match so anyway um
those are some naked dupes and the last
thing I want to finish off with our eye
brushes so the first one is the Sonia
Kashuk this is the number 116 they do
for that
is the elf what is this professional
blending brush you guys can see they
basically are the same exact amount of
bristles it's amazing right here i have
a bh cosmetics brush it doesn't tell me
what it is and then of course the
tapered blending a 35 from sigma and
those are those two and then right here
i have these tapered blending a 40 from
sigma and then Ecotools brush so i think
they are definitely dupes they feel like
dupes when i'm using them so yeah anyway
that was my little dupes video I put
this all out on my bed I'm worried it's
gonna work go all over this nice
comforter but I hope you guys enjoyed
this I loved oops I think dupes are
really fun to watch the videos and
things like that and it takes a long
time to find oops but um when you do
it's kind of fun to share them it's my
first time sharing it so I hope you guys
enjoyed this and i'll see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
