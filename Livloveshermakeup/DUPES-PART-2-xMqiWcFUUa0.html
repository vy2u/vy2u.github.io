video is going to be part two of my
dupes little I guess it's not really a
series that I'm doing but I've been
doing a few dupe videos lately so I
thought what the heck this will be
number two I will link at number one
down in the description bar if you are
curious or want to watch it I don't know
what I'm doing but I'm going to be doing
this little guide right here you guys
can see I already did the lipstick I
started watching those already on the
back of my hand and let's just get right
into it shall we I probably will end up
doing a part 3 part 4 whatever on just
dupes because I really feel like having
tubes in my collection so without
further ado let's just get right into it
the first thing I am duping is the
surely rose water balancing this if you
are new to my channel you just get used
to seeing this a lot I talk about this
product all the time I love it for my
combination skin I use it to set in my
skincare in the morning and at night so
it's the last step that I use it
skincare in the morning and at night
it's amazing it smells like rose
you get 3.3 fluid ounces for $35 on the
sephora.com website but I did find agent
for it you get four fluid ounces in this
little bottle so you get more product
and it is half the price this is the
shade Terra moroccan rose water ester C
facial spritz it's got 99.7% natural
ingredients with collagen regeneration
properties absolutely amazing savings
accent really feels like the same sort
of formula and I feel like it does the
same sort of thing it really makes my
combination skin feel nice and just kind
of calm and balanced so definitely a
dupe for each other the next dupe i want
to talk about are of this little guys
here so i have two lorac lipsticks that
i think are absolutely beautiful the
first one is the highly pigmented
lipstick in the shade celebrity and this
was from their 20th anniversary like lip
collection it looks like this it's a
beautiful kind of red color and it looks
more true red in the actual packaging
however when you swatch it out it's kind
of like a berry red and i have that once
washed right there yeah right there I
was like wait which one right there and
I think it's absolutely beautiful it has
a little bit of a matte finish and I
think it's just a gorgeous gorgeous
color I did find a dupe for it however
in the maybelline vivid in the
shade 895 on fire red and again this one
looks like it would be more red like
when you put it on however when you
swatch it side-by-side you guys can see
they are very very similar to each other
the Maybelline one definitely has more
of a glossy finish but overall they are
very similar and I think they are very
very beautiful I love those kind of red
colors with the beautiful sort of berry
undertones I think those are really
special so those are a dupe the next one
I'm going to do for you guys is the
highly pigmented lipstick from lorac
again in the shade dominatrix this was
again from their 20th anniversary like
collection it looks like this and you
know in the tube it looks like it would
be a very very deep almost like brown
color however it really actually
squashes out more like a deep berry
shade I have the lorac one right there
and then right next to it I have a big
boo boo you guys I'm so bad at watch it
it's so bad I blame it on my
left-handedness but I just cannot I
cannot do swatches anyway there is the
lorac one and the one right next to it
is the dupe and it is from the drugstore
it is the Revlon Super Lustrous lipstick
in the shade 477 black cherry this is a
creme again when you look at it it looks
like it would be more Brown tones but
when you swatch it out you get that
beautiful deep deep deep dark berry
shade so there are the two of them next
to each other and those are dopes
alright the next one I want to talk
about I already drop a little pencil or
the little dupe but this is from the
bite Beauty lipstick line but which
lipstick line from bite Beauty the
butter cream lipstick formula which is a
beautiful beautiful formula and this
shade is called Heather it's a gorgeous
kind of peachy pinky Mavi color this is
what it looks like and I have it's
washed right I'm gonna can't even tell
which is which it's right there it's the
glossy one I have it's washed right
there and the one next to it is actually
from the drugstore and it is from wet
and wild it hasn't completely set yet
which is probably why it couldn't tell
the difference between the two but it is
actually a matte lip pencil from Wet n
Wild called The Velvet Matte lip color
in a 6-3 6-3
a36 three
hickory-smoked and it's absolutely
beautiful it does dry completely matte
so obviously they don't have the same
sort of formulation however it's my cut
again I'm like looking at I'm like which
one is it it is right here it's right
there that's the one so that is the bite
buttercream lipstick and Heather and
then you have hickory-smoked from wet
and wild very very similar
this one will dry down to a matte finish
so obviously the formulation is not the
same but the color is beautiful and I
think those colors are so so pretty I
really enjoy that Heather color I felt
like it was something that well I didn't
have a lot of in my collection and I was
really excited when I got to do so love
those the next thing I'm gonna do for
you guys is the Too Faced candle glow
highlighter I love this highlighter it
has two separate sides you have a pink
side and then kind of like a golden side
I usually just end up mixing these two
together but I'm going to show you guys
a dupe for this side which is the golden
time so this is what it looks like it's
absolutely beautiful
super super like heavily pigmented
absolutely stunning like I love it so
much and there it is so watched can you
guys see that hopefully there it is
swatched and the dupe that I found for
it is the makeup revolution vivid baked
highlighter in the shade golden lights
again absolutely stunning it actually
has a very very similar formulation like
the texture feels the same like
everything is just play girl it's like
the same thinking really really
beautiful I think that the makeup
revolution one might even be a little
more pigmented but there they are next
to each other so you have the toothpaste
and then the makeup revolution one
really really gorgeous highlighters
highly recommend checking out any of the
makeup revolution baked highlighters I
think they're all fantastic and yeah
those are a dip
alright the next tip I'm going to talk
about is for the hourglass ambient
lighting powder in the shade dim light
and a little mini one here this is a
very very popular one a month a month
let amongst a lot of skin tones it's a
beautiful kind of sandy beige shade and
this is gonna be hard to I'm not gonna
swatch this is it's gonna be very hard
to pick up on camera since these are
very light and not super super opaque
but the dupe that I have found for this
particular one actually is the same sort
of formulation as well as pigmentation
it feels very cream
and they wear just as long this is from
the elf illuminating palette and it
doesn't have a name like on the specific
shade but there is one in here that has
a little bit of like a topi tan color to
it and this is the dupe for the ambient
lighting powder in the shade of dim
light maybe I can swatch it on my finger
so you guys can see so they look very
very similar to each other they just
want to show up on my skin because
they're kind of like well a powder so
anyway those are a dupe for each other
the next one I want to talk about is a
blush dupe and I was so excited to find
this dupe because I love these
Illamasqua blushes they are gorgeous
they are stunning they're just oh my god
they're so creamy they're amazing and I
actually found like a very similar dupe
in not only color they don't even look
similar like when you look at them like
this but they swapped out some living
but anyway I have not only found a dupe
before these same sort of formulation
but also the color so this is the
illamasqua powder blush in the shade
tremble I don't even think this is
picking up true to color on camera it's
beautiful it's like a peachy Coralie
gorgeous perfect color that really
doesn't explain it very well but that's
okay this is what it looks like right
there on my arm just a beautiful color
and I'm telling you the formulation of
this feels like a butter on the skin
like it's absolutely amazing and the
dupe that I found for it is from Jordana
and I love love love sorry if I look
weird right now I'm just watching these
out on my arm view but that is what they
look like so the one on the top is from
Jordana the one on the bottom is from
Illamasqua I feel like the Illamasqua
one is maybe slightly um slightly
lighter but when you really kind of
blend them out they look very very
similar on the skin I swear to you I
wore one the other day on my cheek and
there's one on the other cheek and you
could not tell a difference and these
illamasqua powder blushes are pricey and
they're a beautiful formulation so sorry
I didn't even tell you what the Dubois
it is the Georgiana blush in the shade
fifty coral radiance and like I said
they don't look like they would be a
cube when you look at them side by side
in the packaging they just don't look
like they would be that similar this one
looks a lot more Coralie this one looks
a lot more pinky but I think they are
when you blend them out on the cheeks I
really think they look similar so those
are eight two and then now I want to get
into a few palates
I'm not going to sit here and be like
okay let's swatch out the exact ones
that you know are matches but I just
wanted to give you guys an idea on some
popular palates one is that I have found
that aren't like affordable eyeshadow
palettes that could dupe the other ones
so the first one I want to talk about is
the tartlet in bloom palette this is a
gorgeous gorgeous palette lots of
neutral pretty colors in here and I have
found that the revealed palette from
Coastal Scents have a lot of similar
colors these are beautiful and I'm
guessing that if you have the Naked
palette I don't own mine anymore and did
not like it I'm guessing that you're
gonna get the same sort of color overlay
because these are supposed to be kind of
a dupe for the naked palettes they're
much better in my opinion but I found
that the touch one and this one just
have a lot of color similarities and I'm
really really liking it so I feel like
there's a lot of colors that you could
dupe in here on that firecracker shade
wow oh gosh it's not gonna work well but
that firecracker shade in the in bloom
palette is really really popular and
beautiful these kind of pretty shades
like rebel and leader which are nice and
matte I feel like you can get the same
sort of looks and they have the same
sort of pigmentation in this particular
palette like this one right here looks
similar to firecracker or no this one
looks similar to firecracker this one
looks similar to leader just really
really pretty nice arrangement of satin
and matte colors I think that you can
easily recreate a look with that one and
then let's talk a little bit about the
Too Faced natural matte palette I
absolutely adore this palette and from
doing some swatches and kind of looking
at its side by side if this is a very
very comparable to the Sonia Kashuk eye
on neutral palette which you can get at
the drugstore which is beautiful this is
completely matte as well and like this
shade right here is very similar to
honey butter in
Too Faced palettes again I'm gonna find
all this side-by-side but you can see
that there's just some colors in there
that look very very similar like um push
up is that the shape no strapless looks
a very very similar to this one honey
butter looks very similar to that one
having looks very similar to that one
just some pretty obvious like color
overlays that would work for each other
and I have swatched a few of them and
they really do look similar when i
swatched them out I don't have tons of
room to swatch on my arm right now but
just I promise I probably do they look
very very similar all right the next one
I want to talk about the vice 4 palette
from Urban Decay this is one of those I
was like can I even find something
that's similar to this it has beautiful
beautiful jewel tones and I actually did
find something in my collection that I
thought was quite similar and just as
beautiful and that is the NYX wicked
dreams palette this has 24 shadows and
it's gorgeous you get a bunch of jewel
tones in here they're even more buttery
I'm not going to say pigmented but
they're even more buttery than some of
the shadows in the Urban Decay 1 and I
just think they're so beautiful you get
that kind of green color that blue color
and you can clearly see when you open up
this palette that some of those will
work for each other like that blue shade
down there that green there and I did
swatch some of them side-by-side and I
thought they looked really really nice
again if you guys would like me to do a
more in depth look and actually do like
side by side absolute comparison
swatches with certain palettes I can
absolutely do that just let me know in
the downbar but i just kind of wanted to
go through these quickly just to kind of
show you guys that they are similar if
that makes sense
and then i did a whole video yesterday
on the advisor of 0-7 cold max palette
and somebody was asking well are there
any comparable palettes and in my
opinion this meat matte nude palette
from the balm is kind of similar some of
the cool tones that you get in that buys
are palette which is on the top like
those beautiful kind of cool tones like
the gray the slate gray and that kind of
purply gray color up there I feel like
you can also get in the balm palettes
with these shades like Matt Johnson Matt
you know hum all these kind of shades
like these look very very similar to let
me swatch some of the colors in the
vibes art palette so hopefully you guys
are seeing that I think that that is a
pretty darn good honestly if that buys
our palette I don't love I don't think
it really is worth the $80 but the way
that they put these advise art palettes
together it is very tempting because I
feel like it's hard to do out a palette
like that these are just gorgeous
gorgeous colors but I do feel like a lot
of the shades that are in here actually
are pretty good for that so anyway that
is on my dupes video and number two I
will probably continue doing you know
these kind of videos the more that I
kind of play around with my collection
let me know if you guys like these
videos and let me know if you would like
a more in-depth look at like eyeshadow
palette dupes so thank you so much for
joining me and I will see you guys in
tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
