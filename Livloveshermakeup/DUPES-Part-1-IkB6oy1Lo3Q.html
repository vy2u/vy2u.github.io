thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having an absolutely
fantastic day I am here to share some
dupes with you guys today I went through
my collection the past couple of days
especially last night and I found even
more products so I will be renting this
into two parts I don't know when the
second part is gonna go up yet but it
would take forever if I only did
everything at once so I am gonna be
breaking this into two parts but I'm
really really excited to share with you
guys I'm sorry if I look a little blank
face today I just it's been a very very
busy work week and I just did not have a
lot of time to get ready this morning so
anyway let's just get right into it
the first thing I want to talk about is
from Kota Lee this is the resveratrol
eye lifting balm this is quite a pricey
eye cream and I was really really
excited when I found a dupe for it at
the drugstore so the drugstore dupe is
from Neutrogena this is the hydro boost
gel eye cream with hyaluronic acid it's
absolutely fantastic I really also
enjoyed the hydro boost water gel that's
like the actual face book thing fasal
that's the actual facial moisturizer but
this one is fantastic and the
consistency of the two of these are an
absolute dupe I noticed I used this on
my right eye for a whole week and this
on my left eye and I noticed the same
amount of like plumping up my fine lines
it gave the same kind of hydration and
has the exact same texture so if you're
looking into the quarterly resveratrol
eye lifting balm go ahead and just pick
up the Neutrogena one for half the price
alright and the next thing I want to
talk about is a primer this is the bio
sell two cheek left blur primer it looks
like this I love this this is one of my
all-time favorite primers but there is a
drugstore dupe and it is from Maybelline
this is the maybelline baby skin instant
pore eraser both of these have a really
really high silicon level in them but
they're so beautiful and lovely on the
skin they really just make anything that
you put on top like your foundation and
your powder everything to make it look
amazing
so those two are definitely a dupe for
each other the next one I want to talk
about is this foundation here from Tarte
this is the Amazonian clay full coverage
foundation I love this I love the
consistency it's got a bit of like a
whipped consistency and I was really
really excited to see that the
Maybelline Dream velvet soft matte
hydrating foundation gave me the same
amount of coverage and also had the same
exact consistency this color is a little
off for me right now
it's a little too pinky and this one
definitely had a better I think it's
hard to line in general just have a
better shade range however these have
the same amount of coverage and they
have the same consistency so I really
really think these are definitely a dupe
for each other all right let's talk
about like a BB cream or CC cream sort
of thing there's this Stila or that's DL
up there is the Stila illuminating
tinted moisturizer the sub SPF 20 this
is oil-free and water-resistant my shade
is the zero blonde this is really really
nice but it is quite pricey I believe
it's around twenty-five dollars there is
a dupe for this from the drugstore and
it is the Neutrogena Healthy Skin glow
shares this is an illuminating tinted
moisturizer as well and it also has SPF
well this one actually has more SPF this
SPF 30 I find that the consistency of
these are so so so similar they both
have SPF in them and they are definitely
definitely a dupe for each other so if
you are looking for a good tinted
moisturizer and URI in the Stila one go
ahead and get yourself the Neutrogena
one instead
all right let's move on it cosmetics
makes a little lip product called as
Janus a quoi which everybody knows about
it's lovely it's kind of one of those
leave your lips but better sort of lip
products where you put it on and it
actually adheres to like the natural pH
in your lips or the heat in your lips
whatever that means
it's really really wonderful I'm not
gonna swatch with you guys because you
can't really swatch this product it
really just kind of adheres to the color
or the warmth on your skin but it comes
out clear like this and I believe this
is quite pricey I don't know the exact
price of this but this is quite pricey
now else recently released the lip glow
in the shade perfect pink and this is
absolutely a dupe for it I'm gonna say
the consistency is a little different I
think that the elf one gives more of a
glossy finish where is the a cosmetics
one has more of like a not matte finish
but it just kind of sticks to your lips
a little more but this one definitely
has more of a glossy or finished I feel
like the elf one goes on a lot better it
just kind of glides on very very quickly
but the it cosmetics one lasts longer on
my lips however if you do want a color
dupe I believe that these aren't the
exact thing alright moving on I'm
dropping things all over if you are
someone who loved tinted lip balms um
let's see the brand fresh makes
something called to their sugar tinted
lip balms
wonderful this particular sheet is
called passion it's a beautiful kind of
plummy but light color let me show you
guys let me do a swatch on the back of
my hand so you guys can see it's really
really nice and moisturizing and it's
just got a beautiful beautiful color to
it however I did find a very very cheap
dupe for it in the elf what is this
these are the new elf little tinted lip
balms and the shade is very sweet these
are only two dollars so a really really
good deal and I feel like they
definitely are a very very similar I
would say um that one is a little more
glossy the one from fresh is a little
more glossy maybe a little more of a red
tone but they are very very very similar
in color and I adore them both so if you
are looking into those sugar passion lip
balms or any of the shades they have so
many they have like very honey cherry a
lot of the elf lip balms or the
Maybelline Baby Lips have very very
similar consistencies and they have the
same SPF level and also they have the
same kind of color alright let's talk
about mascara really quickly I have a
dupe here one of my favorites is the
Laura Mercier this is the extra extra
lash sculpting mascara in black onyx I
love this it's got a great wine it's a
weight limit it's got a great wand it's
super super fantastic sorry guys a
little early in the morning for me to be
talking but anyway it's got a great
fantastic wand but the wand isn't really
what I'm comparing it to what I have
noticed is that the Maybelline the
falsies push-up drama give me the same
exact sort of effect to my lashes I will
say both of these are a very um kind of
waxy oily wet to formula so if you do
not like what formulas for your mascara
you will not like these products however
I think this one is absolutely fantastic
as well the wan does not look at the
exact same it looks definitely similar
but it is not the exact same but I
really like the way that this sculpts
out my lashes I feel like it's one of
those three and one products that really
volumizes lengthens and also gives
definition so those are definitely a
dupe for each other in my opinion the
next one I want to talk about you
probably want to go and get the
drugstore dupe immediately a
as possible it is the dupe for the
amazing cosmetics amazing concealer in
ivory um well I guess it could be really
in any shade because they really have a
large selection but this is what it
looks like anything very very thick like
concealer like it's a little oily but
very very thick it's like extreme
coverage guys extreme coverage so that
is what it looks like on my hand as you
guys can see it covers things that
covers whatever you want to cover so the
tube that I have found is from the Wet n
Wild Fergie line which is actually being
discontinued so if you do want to get
your hands on a really heavy-duty
coverage concealer and you were looking
at the amazing cosmetics one go run out
and get a few tubes of this I did I
picked up three tubes of this this is
the Wet n Wild come correct celebrity
concealer in the shade a one one one
fair so let me show you guys what it
looks like again it's just not just like
amazing amazing feel it kind of came out
like oily I love how I'm like it's
amazing amazing concealer and it's like
coming up oily not cool but just like I
said with the other one it kind of has
like a bit of oil in it so it's kind of
heme acted like it kind of works under
the eye but it still is a little bit um
thick under the eye in my opinion but
anyway this is what it looks like so as
you guys can see they both are very very
full coverage obviously they're not the
exact same color because they are from
different lines but they have the same
exact coverage I would even go further
to say that the Fergie one had even more
light coverage to it like I said
they do have a little bit of a greasy
consistency if you're not really into
that you probably won't like these but
they're a really good option for a heavy
duty concealer for those of you who have
dry skin so if you were looking at the
amazing cosmetics one I believe this is
$28 this is like $8 that is a dupe all
right so the next thing I want to talk
about our eyeliners and I have a Jeep
here um from NARS right
yes NARS this is the NARS larger than
life long wear eyeliner in Via Veneto
it's beautiful it glides on really
really nicely and it stays very well on
the waterline and this is just a kind of
satiny Mac like satin neck it's just a
satiny black color I think it's
wonderful and I really do like the way
it wears on my waterline however
Maybelline makes something very very
similar
same consistency kind of like that
satiny black finish and it does wear on
the waterline very very well as well
this is the Maybelline master drama by
eye studio in midnight master so let me
go ahead and swatch those you guys can
see so there they are next to each other
you can see the Maybelline one even has
like a little more pigment to it dare I
say and actually both on maybe even a
little smoother so I really really love
both of these I think they're fantastic
but why not get you know I mean why not
get this one if it's cheaper you know
why not all right moving on these will
be the last thing that I talk about
because this video is already 10 minutes
but this is a dupe sorry every two for
stock this is they do for the benefits
of gimme brow so I love this this is
like a fantastic product the shape that
I have is a leg /medium it's basically
just this nice tiny little like brow
enhancing products got a little bit it's
adorable and you can just go through
your brows and it thickens them up it
kind of has fibers in it that stick to
it it's really really nice it is quite
pricey however and you do use quite a
bit of it quickly so um the models
co-brand came out with basically the
exact same thing of their little concept
and this is in a light flash medium
again the same sort of shade selection
and it's basically the same exact
product so if you are looking for a two
before the benefits gimme brow then this
one is a good one
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video
thank you so much for joining me I have
been having a few issues with my camera
which is why I'm filming on my laptop I
apologize about that I really do I will
be back to filming on like it's just
been going back and forth the past
couple days I love the SD card and then
I was using my boyfriend's SD card and
then he went out of town and took it and
then I stuck here with this camera and
then I tried turning it on today and I
was having a few issues so it is
actually I'm not even with me right now
it's actually adds like them what do you
call it like I guess the cyborg hospital
basically being taken care of so I I'm
picking it up tomorrow so my video
tomorrow will be felt on that but I'm
sorry I know that the quality is a
little crappy
