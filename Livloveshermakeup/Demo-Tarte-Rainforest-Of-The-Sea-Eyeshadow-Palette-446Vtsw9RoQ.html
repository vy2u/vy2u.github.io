oops wait let me turn my ring light up
all the way since I am showing a little
makeup look here alright welcome back to
my channel thank you so much for joining
me happy Friday and hope you guys are
all having a fantastic day so far I am
here to kind of play around with my new
Tarte rainforest of the sea eyes shadow
palette with you guys today I'm gonna
call this a demo not a tutorial because
I didn't really like have a specific eye
look I was going for when I did this
side of my face I just kind of wanted to
show you guys how a lot of these eye
shadows look on the actual I how I like
to apply them and I also went in with
quite a few colors in here this is the
actual palette I went in with quite a
few colors in this palette today and I
just thought it would be fun to show you
guys how they layer on top of each other
how nicely they blend out if you are
interested in seeing a review on this I
will link it below and I'm also going to
link below or not linked below but right
below everything that's on my face so if
you're wondering what's on my nails or
what I'm wearing or my face makeup or a
lip makeup or lip makeup lip products I
will list those below but anyways let's
just get right into it shall we so the
first thing I'm gonna do is go ahead and
line up my waterline with these smashbox
always sharp a waterproof coal liner in
the shade sumatra it looks like this
it's just a deep dark brown like
espresso shade really really nice little
point on there and i'm just gonna put
this on my waterline and also my tight
line just so that we can kind of get
some color right onto the lash line i
either always like I don't know why I've
been doing this lately like literally
putting on eyeliner first I normally put
eyeliner on after my eye shadow but
lately I've just liked to put it on
before for whatever reason so I really
really love this eyeliner it lasts all
day that's absolutely fantastic and then
I'm going to go in with this BH
Cosmetics fluffy crease brush it looks
like this and we are just going to get
right into the palette so I'm gonna take
the shade sand which is this color right
here and I'm gonna put that all over my
lid all the way up to my brow bone I
hope I can remember the shades that I
used on this eye
I used a lot of the shades that she
wanted to show you guys like how nicely
they can be layered and used all over
and I didn't want to do anything too
dramatic I have a concert today it's not
actually my concert it's one of my
students concert so I want to make sure
that I look like a music teacher and not
like a smoked out like I don't know
super dramatic like sexy teacher so I'm
not trying to do anything too dramatic
if that makes sense so we put that all
over I also put it underneath my eye
just for a little bit of brightness then
I'm going to go into the shade Co which
is right next to it it's kind of this
like Sam stone II sort of color right
there and I'm going to go with the same
brush and I'm just gonna put this right
into my crease and I love the
consistency on these shadows they're
very similar to the makeup geek foiled
eyeshadows and I love them they have a
really nice sticky consistency a lot of
them don't have fallout which is nice
but they're still super super creamy and
blendable alright so I think the next
one I went into on this side was reef so
we're gonna go into the shade reef which
is this one right here and I'm going in
with my morphe m4 for one brush and I'm
gonna tap in there I will tap off the
access on access the excess on this one
and I'm just gonna start working this
into my crease I love this shade it's so
beautiful it's like a ready kind of
burnt almost orangie shade I don't know
if that's gonna show up on camera but it
has a little bit of a warmer definitely
a warmer undertone so I'm just going
back and forth putting that right into
my crease to kind of put some depth into
that area and sorry if I'm sniffling you
guys every time I film a devil I noticed
I'm sniffling and now I'm scared that
I'm allergic to my makeup I always think
I'm going down with a cold and I'm like
hmm I wonder if I'm allergic to my
makeup that is one of those things where
it's like if I'm allergic to it I just
do not care I am still gonna take this
face every day anyway I am blending it
out now with my Sigma e-40 brush just
doing back and forth motions and then
also some little small circular motions
here and there some of these little
motions whatever this is kind of just
it's going like this on the eye area
and then I am going to go in and I think
what I did on the other side was going
with this urban decay I really like this
little brush it's from the urban decay
reloaded palette I just take this side
right here and I'm going going to go
into the shade seashell which is this
like light pink shade right there and
I'm gonna put that all over my lid and I
just love this it's a beautiful kind of
light pink shade just absolutely
absolutely stunning I'm gonna take a
little on the inner corner of my eye as
well because I'm pretty sure that's what
I did on the other side I just love this
color it's beautiful and then I'm gonna
go into the shade abyss which is a dark
plum each sort of color and I'm going to
be taking this japonesque brush it
reminds me of the what is this the Sigma
e25 blending brush is kind of one of
those flat brushes but it actually it
looks like a little Oreo cookie you have
like the dark side here and the light
side here so I'm gonna take the dark
side I'm gonna dip into abyss and we're
gonna put that on our outer V just to
give a little bit of a definition right
there so I'm just tapping it on and then
going a little bit into the outer crease
I'm not taking it in all the way I'm
just taking it right on the outer part
of the eye and into the outer part of my
place just like that just stamping the
color on there then I'm going to go into
a clean Sigma e-40 brush I have so many
of these literally I love them and I'm
just going to blend in circular motions
to make sure that we have blended
everything really well
just like that then I'm going to go back
into the shade of sand with the same
brush which is that white color or that
kind of seashell
I shouldn't say seashell because that's
an actual shade in this palette it's
kind of like a white pretty kind of
yellowy shade alright just making sure
everything is all blended out I can't
remember what else they put over here I
think that was about it
for the lids and then I'm going to go in
with this little Urban Decay 24/7
blending brush it's kind of like a
elongated pencil brush and I'm going to
dip in to the shade what did i do on
this side I think I did yeah I did
reef so that was the dark coppery color
again I'm going to dip in there and then
take this on the outer part of my lower
lash line then I believe I went into the
shade wave which is like a beautiful
sort of taupe color and then I put that
on the inner corner or the inner part of
the lower lash line and wave is right
here beautiful color trying to use as
many of these as possible as you guys
can kind of see how they actually apply
onto the eye and then I'm going to take
a little more of that seashell pink
color and just hit the inner corner
again just to make sure we have some
lightness there all right and then after
all of that is done I'm going to go back
into that BH Cosmetics fluffy crease
brush and I'm just blending everything
together and I know like I don't have
any sort of like a lot of definition
going on on this side but that was kind
of the point I wanted to guys to see how
everything blended together so I
literally am blending the lower part of
my eye the lid part everything together
just so you guys can see it's kind of
like a light smoky topi look I think
it's actually really pretty normally I
would like like definition like you can
see like where I put the color on the
outer V and on the lid and stuff like
that but I just wanted you guys to see
how nicely these shades actually blend
together and look on the eyes and yeah
alright so now we're going to go in to
my lash curler this is my Revlon Lashkar
I'm just gonna curl my lashes for ten
seconds kind of pumping though I was
gonna say the wand pumping they like
curling I guess it's kind of like a
curling wand a couple of times like that
just to curl them then I'm gonna go in
with my Urban Decay subversion thicker
longer stronger at the mashed primer I
love this oh by the way quickly I'm
gonna take my best semi cosmetics
boudoir finishing brush and go
underneath just in case there is a
little bit of fallout but again these
like shadows have like a kind of like
tacky sticky formula to them but they're
super super soft stealth but I just want
to make sure that I didn't have any
fallout I really don't get a lot with
these anyway so I'm just putting my lash
primer on on my upper lashes and also my
lower lashes I'm gonna let that sit
there for a second whoa that was like
really chunky right there goodness
gracious
alright and then I'm going to go into my
empty J this is the high definition
mascara this is in the shade HD black it
looks like this I believe I got this a
neat glossy box it's got a really cool
wand we're like right on my alley
totally up my alley it's like a what is
that like rubber bristle brush with a
bunch of little like balls on it it
sounds so weird but it's true alright so
I'm putting one layer of this on my
upper and lower lashes this is a really
nice like layering mascara so if you
want to put it on first and then layer
other mascaras on I think it looks
really really pretty which is what I
will be doing in this video
so I put my first mascara on I'm going
to let that kind of sit and get a little
tacky quickly and then I'm gonna go in
with my lung comb excessive black
Hypnose drama mascara I love this and
we're really gonna kind of layer this on
I'm gonna hit the back of my lashes as
well which really kind of makes your
lashes a little more defined and clumpy
so if you don't like that I don't
recommend doing it but I am just going
to go like this and then I'm gonna hit
the backs of my lashes as well and this
will make them look a little more clumpy
but I really like to find lashes so if
you want to just keep them looking
natural
then I wouldn't recommend hitting from
the back but if you want really really
big lashes then you can do and you could
do this step it's really nice and then
I'm going on the bottom lashes as well
alright and that is the eye look pretty
much it's pretty darn easy I mean this
wasn't really an eye look I was just
kind of messing around with the colors
but I think we use let's see here one
two three four five six colors in here
so that was pretty darn good I really
really love these eye shadows again
they're just so beautiful and so nice
and I feel like this is a really good
deal I believe this palette is 32 or 34
dollars so I feel like that's such a
good deal so I hope you guys enjoyed
this little demo on the new touch
rainforest of the sea eye shadow
palettes thank you so much for joining
me and I will see you guys in tomorrow's
videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
