this video I am giving you guys my
review and swatches on the new Dior Dior
skin nude air glowing gardens
illuminating powder I purchased this for
$58 on the support home website I will
link below where you guys can pick it up
if you are interested it is not an
affiliate link by any means but they
have two different shades right now on
the Sephora comm website these are
basically just like baked jala
highlighters and they have these shades
0:01 which is called glowing pink which
is the one I purchased and they also
have one that is called zero zero two
glowing nude and in here you get a
little kind of kit of things like a
little assortment of things you get a
little Kabuki brush and then you get the
powder in here so let me read a little
bit about what it says on the
sephora.com website you guys can get a
better understanding of what this
product is supposed to do it is an
illuminating powder that comes with a
mini kabuki brush to help sculpt the
face with a radiant glow it says drying
its inspiration from the technique of
strobing do your skin nude air glowing
gardens enhances your face with radiance
this powder features extremely fine
illuminating pigments that are embossed
with a delicate floral motif to achieve
a natural finish lightly sweet powder
over the face with the mini kabuki brush
for a more sophisticated look and longer
wear apply concentrating on the t-zone
and then remove any excess with the
brush so I'm really happy to let you
guys know that I am absolutely adoring
this highlighter I am wearing it today
and I think it's absolutely beautiful on
the skin if you have more medium to
darker skin tones I would suggest
checking out the zero zero two glowing
nude shade it looks like it has a little
bit of like a nude undertone with like
AIDS I would say the overtone looks like
it's kind of goldish so if you like that
you should definitely pick that one up
this one is great it definitely has a
lot of pink in it but kind of like an
opalescent white quality on the skin as
well so it's really really illuminating
and I feel like if you have fair skin it
will look very very beautiful on your
skin it might look a little too harsh if
you have darker skin tone so that's just
what I want to let you guys know but
this is what the outer packaging looks
like is absolutely beautiful it is this
dark um kind of navy blue sort of case
and I just feel luxurious and womanly
when I open this up like
now there is a difference between
high-end makeup and luxury makeup and
that this is luxury but anyway when you
open it up you can see you have this
little velvet case right here and you
get your illuminating powder or your
highlight there with the little kabuki
brush on the side the only thing that I
don't like about this kit is the Kabuki
brush it is very Scratchy I did use it
to apply on the illuminating powder or
highlight today on my face however it is
quite it's just it's too Scratchy it is
quite dead but it is scratchy it does
say you know do you are on the back
there buddy I'm going to go ahead and
toss that out right now just because I'm
not going to use it you know but anyway
it looks like this when you first have
the package open and you pop it open and
underneath there's this beautiful little
velvet sleeve so when you're carrying
this in your person you don't want it to
open up and break everywhere you can
actually put the product in this sleeve
which I feel like it's so luxurious and
beautiful so that is what it looks like
in the sleeve and then you can just pop
it open it is so it's amazing and this
is what the actual packaging looks like
it's like a little cushion but this is
nice this is made out of like I mean
this feels like metal it's heavy it
feels weighted it feels good in my hand
and you can see it kind of has this
mirrored effect and on the back as well
it has a mirrored effect and it will
tell you and show you what shade you
have it says your skin nude air glowing
gardens illuminating powder and 0:01
glowing pink so when you open it up it
has a little bit of a magnetic closure
which is nice and you do get a little
small mirror there and this is what the
highlight looks like oh sorry I can't
help it look how beautiful it is
embossed so it has that gorgeous
gorgeous um
floral print there and then it says Nu
de or nude for the new week nude glowing
gardens so there it is and it's just
absolutely beautiful you guys and I was
thinking that what a couple of times
after putting in my brush and you know
swirling and swatching it with my
fingers that that like embossed area
would come undone but it hasn't yet it's
been fantastic so I am so happy with
this illuminator you guys it is so
beautiful on the skin I love the quality
I love how
finely milled it is it really does feel
like a baked Jala sort of formula it
reminds me a lot of the make up forevers
pro sculpting duo's if you guys have
this one I only have number two which is
kind of a gold shade with a bronzer
shade but this kind of formula where it
feels like it is a mix of powder and
like cream that is what this product
feels like it really is that baekchul a
formula and it just glides on like
butter and it is so pigmented check that
out
isn't that beautiful and like I said I
have that kind of white undertone in it
with a little bit of pink but this built
up on the cheeks is absolutely stunning
there is no kick up there's no nothing
it's just smooth texture through and
through it is absolutely beautiful so
pigmented so gorgeous and I love the way
it looks on my skin I never feel like
it's um you know picking up like a weird
like I don't know how to describe it you
know sometimes you put on a highlighter
and it just picks up in a weird way like
you put it on your skin and you're like
ooh like that emphasizing certain areas
or certain pores that I don't want it to
this never does that it glides on like
butter so right there I have the makeup
for everyone and right there is the Dior
one you can see they have that very very
similar sort of texture I would say the
makeup for everyone is definitely a
little smoother and a little more shiny
and I think you know the reason it is a
little more smooth is because it has
more shine in it but the Dior one is
amazing and I just love that opalescent
white quality that it has there with a
little bit of pink like neutral
undertone absolutely stunning so I
really don't have a lot to say about
this product I think it's absolutely
fantastic it wears for a very long time
on my cheekbones I am wearing it down my
nose today a little bit on my forehead
on my Cupid's bow at my chin and then my
cheekbones and I just love the way it
picks up like it just the light hits it
in a certain way and it looks gorgeous
there's no chunks of glitter in here
it's just smooth smooth it's like smooth
sailin it's just beautiful you don't
have to worry about it sinking into your
skin it just glides on top and it's
gorgeous so I am
absolutely loving this illuminator I
mean this is going to be a pretty quick
review but I just don't have tons to say
I think it's absolutely stunning it
works so well you can literally apply it
with your fingers you can apply it with
your Sigma tapered highlighter brush any
sort of brush this will apply
beautifully on the skin and I would say
you don't have to build up the color it
really just will go on nicely in one
application and it will give you full on
beautiful beautiful glow and
illuminating properties to the skin so I
am so impressed I don't have a lot from
Dior I think the only thing that I
bought from them is the creme de Rose
lip balm I believe yeah so this is kind
of my second product from them and I am
so impressed it's not just the packaging
and the quality that was put into the
actual product it's the way that it
performs and looks on the skin it wears
forever it's beautiful it's extremely
pigmented and it just glides onto the
skin like butter so two thumbs up for
this new Dior nude air glowing gardens
and I will
like I said link below where you guys
can pick this up right now as of right
now the glowing nude shade is available
but that could you know that could sell
out at any moment this 0:01 shade the
pink one is not available but hopefully
they will bring it back I believe this
is limited edition I think this is part
of their spring collection so I will
link below and hopefully you guys can
get your hands on at least one of these
because they are wonderful thanks so
much for joining me guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
