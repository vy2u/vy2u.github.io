reviews on the contouring products that
have come out recently from Ulta Sephora
just all sorts of places and this one is
going to be on the dr. jart BB mate
contouring one two three kit it comes in
this cute little like paper packaging
and basically inside you get three
talked about that cart in a second but
you get three of these products you get
a highlight two a neutralizer and a
bronzer shade now the thought of these
is that they're supposed to be like the
texture and have the kind of benefits
that dr dr BB creams have in them if
you've ever tried the dr dr BB creams
you know that they have really really
good coverage they make your skin appear
really really smooth and they have
really nice anti-aging benefits like
sunscreen in them this is no exception
these do have sunscreen in them let's
see here they have a titanium dioxide
and zinc oxide so those are natural
sunscreens so that's kind of cool um and
basically in this kit you get three of
these little tubes that look like this
and this one is the highlight i'll show
you guys that looks like on the back of
my hand it's a really really light
almost like pink undertone highlight and
what I love about the shade is that it's
light enough to be a highlight on girls
who have fair skin as you guys can see
they blend out really really easily and
it just looks so luminous on the skin
the next one that they come the next one
that comes in this kit is the
neutralizer shade which is like a yellow
we I would say it just has a yellowy
creamy undertone to it it almost looks
like like a custard kind of color and it
is great for having under the eyes like
dark circles and also just lifting areas
where you contour like underneath and
above so it looks like that and this
also blends really really seamlessly I
think this is such a neat idea that dr.
jart did with having instead of doing
like the stick contour or the powder
this is just completely different it's
like little tubes of different colored
BB creams that you're putting on your
face
it's just it's a really good concept and
this is the bronzer shade this is a very
light bronzer in my opinion and I'm not
saying on my skin tone I'm saying in
general I don't think a lot of people
can use this kit it's not as it doesn't
have as many options as say the NYX
contouring kit I just reviewed this this
has like a lot of options for light skin
medium skin dark skin this kit really I
think kind of goes for people to have
light skin as you can see I'm pretty
pale and as that blends out it's you
know it I don't think that would show up
on the majority of skin tones so that's
really my only complaint with this
product I think that the packaging is
cute I think the concept is great it's
not a stick form it's not powder it's
different I love the fact that it has a
high SPF in it it is so so important to
be protecting your skin no matter what
kind of products you're using on your
face and dr. jart always does that he
always puts good ingredients into his
products and he uses natural sunscreens
which is awesome and I think that you
know like I said my only real big issue
is that this like a bronzer shade is not
going to be dark enough for a lot of
people of course for me it is it's nice
and it's dark enough but for a lot of
people it's not going to be also with
the neutralizer shade this could almost
be a highlight on some people which
means that by the time you get to this
color if you are deeper in you know skin
tone than I am if you say you have like
a beautiful caramel complexion this is
gonna be way too light for you so I
think that this was kind of um
advertised towards people who have fair
skin so I am happy I picked it up for
that reason because I do have fair skin
but overall you know maybe they'll come
out with a deeper kit that would be nice
um but yeah that's really my big
complaint they also come with this it
comes with this little card that shows
you step-by-step how to use the products
which I like so number one is to
highlight it says with a sheer glowy
finish this shade sculpt enhances and
illuminates the high points of the face
helps reduce shadowy areas and signs of
fatigue so that's this one and it says
apply it under the eyes middle of
forehead brow bones cheekbones and chin
as step number two is to neutralize
that's this kind of yellowy shape it
says secret weapon use this lightweight
creamy textured neutral shade to soften
the edges where you apply bronzer
creating a seamless transition which
blends with your natural skin tone and
then the last shade or step is to bronze
and it said number three bronzing
the ideal bronzer for shading and
defining creates depth and dimension by
accentuating the natural topography of
the face apply around hairline under
cheekbones sides of nose and jaw line so
um I think that these do a great job for
people with fair skin when it comes to
doing all those things you know
neutralizing bronzing and highlighting
especially the highlight it's like so
light it's awesome so um I do like this
kit I would say out of all the like
contouring products that I've tried out
recently my next one is my favorite
because I think it fits everybody's skin
tone you get this deep chocolatey color
that will show up on basically anybody
skin tone you get this really light
highlight that will show up on anybody's
good tongue so my biggest complaint is
that dr. jart just didn't make this
suitable for everybody skin tone um I
don't know if that was on purpose
or if they just thought that these would
really blend well with everybody skin
tone but for me as they pale skinned
girl these do work well on let me read a
little bit of that says on the Support
website again it was $45 on the Sephora
website it says it is a skin perfecting
BB cream with SPF 30 that gives a
complexion of the complexion a contoured
sculpted look
it says contouring BB cream that makes
skin appear natural with this liquid and
creamy texture and silky smooth finish
and I must agree really does look
natural on the skin
you really can't overdo it with the
products it says it features SPF 30 sun
protection yes SPF 30 good job guys good
job talk to her it's so good and it says
it comes in three shades this multi
texting BB cream is formulated with a
skincare base that's infused with 40%
moisturizing ingredients this liquid
base contouring kit creates a
natural-looking shading effect while it
protects the skin and it is formulated
without parabens
sulphates so it says this product is
also hypoallergenic it is free of talc
mineral oil tar dyes um I can't say that
word next one is propylene glycol benzyl
alcohol and artificial fragrances so it
is free of all that you don't want on
your skin it has SPF 30 which is awesome
and it's just it's really good so my
thoughts are that I do like this this is
probably I mean I can't believe all I
know is that so far my NYX contour
palette had been my favorite out of all
the ones I've reviewed and gotten but I
must say that eat this one is very very
good too I'm really really happy with
this kit I'm just not happy that they
kind of marketed it towards people with
only fair complexions so anyway those
are my thoughts on the dr. jart BB make
contouring one two three kits I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and I will see
you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
