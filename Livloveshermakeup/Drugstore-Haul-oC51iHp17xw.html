just was at Duane Reade I was picking up
paper towels trash bags just random
things I needed and I ended up picking
up a bunch of beauty products kind of
out of nowhere it was not planned so I
thought I'd go ahead and show you guys
but I picked up the first thing I picked
up with lore'l visible lift serum
absolute pro retinol 8 plus vitamin C
foundation I have really been loving the
visible lift blur so I thought I'd go
ahead and tried this foundation the next
thing I picked up was this Garnier BB
cream this is the skin renew miracle
liked miracle skin Perfector in fair /
light my skin has been very very dry
lately I'm not really sure what's going
on but I thought maybe it'd be nice to
switch back and forth between a
foundation and BB cream and the next
thing i got is kind of related to that
this is the olay total effects seven in
one eye brightening CC cream again like
I said I've been having very dry skin
very chronically dry skin so I thought
that this might be nice as like my
daytime eye cream but it also has the
benefits of that CC cream in there so
with color correcting the next thing I
picked up was a thing of scrunchies and
some black hair binders gotta have them
good see here the next two things I
picked up we're two of the color tattoos
one of them is in inked in pink which I
do not have yet which is surprising this
is very very popular one and i also
picked one up in what color is this
vintage plum which is also very very
beautiful i love the formula of these
they're really nice and tacky and sticky
and they just kind of really stick to
the eyelid all day and I think that's
really really great something along that
line are similar to that was the color
tattoo pure pigments and this is an
improper copper I thought this was just
really really pretty and they probably
stick really well to those color tattoos
so pick that up I also picked up two of
the color whispers i love the formula of
these i picked one up in ah what is this
mokum use which is like a coffee cake
color
oops my kitties crying yesterday what's
wrong and I asked so picked one up in
the color petal rebel which is a very
light pink like bubblegum pink I thought
those were very cute pretty colors don't
have those ones yet and then I also
picked up two of the Revlon lip butters
I got one in sugar frosting which is
like kind of an odd color i'm surprised
i picked us up but i want to try it out
it's like a topi pinky almost violet
like undertone kind of skin color I
don't know how this is going to work but
I believe it will and I'm gonna try it
anyway so you know keep your fingers
crossed on that one for me and the other
one I picked up was juicy papaya which
is just this gorgeous gorgeous orange
color so love that let's see here the
next thing I picked up was some makeup
remover wipes I actually needed them
tonight if I was going to remove my
makeup which I would like to so these
are the studio 35 cleansing towelettes
wet facial wipes they instantly lift
away and remove impurities these are the
compareto Garnier new trip your
towelettes so garnier has really good
spelling products so I was hoping that
these ones would smell just as good and
the last thing I picked up please don't
laugh at me for but this is the Aqua
stone and this is actually like an as
seen on TV thing um it is a humidifier
but a cute humidifier so hopefully this
will work i told you guys have been
having very very chronically dry skin so
i really really hope that this will work
and if it doesn't of course i'm going to
bring it back but it's really really
cute and i'm going to be the
instructions and see how i can get it to
work tonight and maybe put it on so that
was it for my little i guess beauty haul
I don't know how that turned into a halt
even I really was just at Duane Reade
and then I went into the makeup aisle
and that's what happened so I hope you
guys enjoyed watching this video um like
this video down below if you did and
i'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
