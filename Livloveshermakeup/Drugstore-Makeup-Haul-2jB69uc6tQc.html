you so much for joining me today i have
a drugstore makeup haul for you guys
everything is from the drugstore and
everything is makeup there's no skincare
know whatever in here it's just all
makeup so let's just get started the
first thing I picked up was from l'oreal
this is the new collection exclusive by
doutzen or doutzen Christ I doutzen
kroes I'm not quite sure how to say her
name but she's a Victoria's Secret model
and she's absolutely beautiful and she
came out with this um like collection
exclusive by her the packaging looks
like that excuse my nails um and it's
super super cute it's kind of like I'm
the NARS packaging the actual texture
and then it's like gold and it opens up
and this is called doubt sins or
Dudesons doutzen doutzen kroes I think
it Dawson anyway this is her nude shade
it is in 600 and it is this beautiful
pinky color right here I think it's
absolutely gorgeous and I'm really
really excited to use it let's watch a
little bit on my hand if you guys can
see it's just a really nice light very
very light shimmery pink color alright
next I have another lipstick this is
also from l'oreal this is the l'oreal
colour reach 800 in fairest nude I've
heard a lot of a lot of people talk
about this and I just thought you know I
need to get it so this is baris nude
it's just a beautiful basic nude color I
will swatch that on my hand it's right
there and it's beautiful I can't wait to
wear that one next I got three of the
knicks baked blushes on the first one I
picked up they come this cute little
packaging the first one I picked up is
in pink fetish which i think is
absolutely gorgeous look at that color
ah so beautiful it has lots of lots of
shimmer in it and it's just like a
gorgeous shade can you guys see that oh
my gosh I'm gonna have so much fun with
this shade I really loved those really
dark dark shimmery pinks and I also
really love like light cool tone paint
colors those are like my favorite to
look at not necessarily the best on my
skin tone but just like my favorite
left is like in color I think they're so
beautiful so that one was pink fetish
and i also got um a peachy color called
sugar mama which is kind of like a light
orange e nu D pin peach color looks like
that also very very pretty lots of
shimmer in here so you know very much
kind of a mix of an illuminator in there
like that color swatch that right there
so this one's not as like pigmented but
it does give a nice little flush of
color can you see that it's very pretty
and I also got a third one let me get
these swatches off quickly so I can
keeps watching everything and and the
last one I got is Spanish rose which is
a nice light pink color looks like that
absolutely beautiful again highly highly
shimmery very pretty really like that so
that is right there pretty love it
alright moving on I picked up um let's
see here from hi guys I'm like ass
watching here at the same time trying to
get these off I picked up this covergirl
cg smoothers hydrating makeup in 705
ivory I've heard a lot of people talk
about this product and I just thought it
was time for me to try it out it's
really really small um and it doesn't
look like it will last very long but it
does look like it will be an okay color
match hopefully and um I don't know
these have been around for a very long
time I think some people said they're
like tinted moisturizers and then other
people said they're really really high
coverage and nicely hydrating so I am
excited to try it out it says it
continually hydrate skin for 11 hours so
skin looks smooth and naturally
beautiful it's unscented won't clog
pores and dermatologically tested so
going to try that out again the CG
smoothers from covergirl I picked up the
NYX HD studio a photogenic finishing
powder this is a hundred percent pure
mineral silica powder this is basically
just like the makeup for everyone and
also the elf one so
just a studio finishing powder and yeah
it's just kind of it's like a finishing
powder so you take it all over your face
after it just gives a really nice smooth
complexion so that's the next one I
picked up the Maybelline master
highlight by face studio highlighting
blush looks like this and the color I
got is 20 pink rose I think the shade
was really really beautiful so you get
some nice deep rose colors in there and
then you get um like a shimmery shade
white shade kind of cool everything just
kind of mix this together I just dropped
the little brush that comes with it haha
here's a little brush that comes with it
looks you know it's one of those it's
one of those kind of brushes guys don't
know if i'll keep that but um anyway I
thought this looked really really pretty
let me swatch it quickly and room the
design but at least I get to see what
the color looks like so that's really
nice i like that so you do get a mixed
of a mix you get a mix of nice like
luminosity and just a pretty nice like
pinky rose color so really into that
right now especially during it this time
of the year so i do like that oh no it's
all mixed up it doesn't look as pretty
but it's okay i want to do like in the
back has this giant mirror very nice so
that's the Maybelline next I got the
Revlon Photoready skin lights face
illuminator in 100 bare light I've heard
a lot about these illuminators you can
mix them in with your foundation or oops
or you can just use them as a highlight
so it is a liquid product I hate those
stickers like the tags they put on back
of products so let me just take a little
out here right now okay so it's very
very liquidy and it's kind of got like a
nice like it's definitely deeper than my
skin tone but it gives a nice um like
glow to it can you guys see that that's
very very pretty i really do like that
so I mean mix this in with some of my
lighter foundations that aren't going to
match me during the summer and this can
give me a little bit of a
hello and they did have a pink one and
they also had I think like a lighter
white one so that might be something to
look into but I thought this one kind of
look really interesting kind of look
like almost opal from Becca yeah the
opal skin perfector so did I try it out
next I got two of the Knicks setting
sprays I got the matte finish setting
spray long-lasting setting spray and I
got to the dewy finish setting spray I
love makeup setting sprays I do truly
think that they work so I thought what
the heck I might as well pick these up I
haven't tried any from NYX before so
picked those up hopefully they will be
really good I picked up another color
reach balm from l'oreal i love this
formula i love the texture I love
everything about these bombs the color i
got is heavenly berry and it's a nice
berry shade so i know i'm gonna like
that because i love the texture of these
bones next I picked up the covergirl
bombshell shine shadow by lash blast
shimmer I finish in 325 copper fling it
looks like this and it's supposed to be
like a cream creamy shimmer finish
product kind of thing really really tiny
copper fling looks like that let's watch
it because I have not watched anything
yet okay so it comes out pretty thick
and it is very very nice and creamy and
very beautiful that is the color right
there so you can put that all over your
lid and I just think that's really
really beautiful oh the shine i'm so
into shine right now can you guys tell
so really really like that excited to
try that out i've actually heard good
things about on those shine shadows so
hopefully i'll like this and maybe pick
up a few more because they do have a
right wide variety of shades next I got
to the L'Oreal telescopic shocking
extensions waterproof blackest black
mascara i love the shocking extensions
telescopic mascara so i got the
waterproof one since it is that time of
year right now we're
I don't know my makeup starts to melt
off so I thought music eating a
waterproof formula would be smart so um
this is the silver one this is like the
I don't know it's the telescopic I don't
know you have like a lot of different
versions of this but this have come to
the silver tube and the wand looks like
this and it's very very flexible and
very small and gets into all the areas
that you need it to get into so really
really excited for that I have of course
tried this formula before I just not
tried the waterproof one alright moving
on I got to the Milani fierce foil I
shines in 03 Florence it's like a little
quad like this I've heard some good
things and some bad things about these
but I thought what the heck are you
trying for myself so it comes with a
little X interesting kind of spatula
spongy kind of thing it's like my god
it's not even I don't know it's like
rubber I might keep that interesting
anyway these are the four shades that it
comes in and these are supposed to be
like kind of creamy interesting products
let's go ahead and oh my god they're so
creamy look I just did my finger on
there and there's like a debt all right
okay that's interesting this one's not
nearly as like creamy okay I feel like I
just totally like dented all of that but
let me swatch these let's see what these
are all about very nice very very nice
milani really just doesn't ever make me
not want their products look at that
look how beautiful girls are Wow very
nice very very pigmented very very shiny
I'm gonna have to pick up the other ones
because i had heard like mixed reviews i
was like oh I don't really know if I
want to pick up all of the day I think
they had Milan Florence and Venice maybe
but I just picked up Florence because
they had very neutral kind of shades
beautiful so very very excited I would
probably pick up the other ones have to
see how those do I think they probably
will go really well um not like in the
crease or anything but just as an eyelid
color so definitely like those so far
let me take a sip my candle cha
it's hot in here with those lights all
right next I picked up another color
molten by Maybelline by the ice to do
these little duos this is in nude rush I
do like these so I like to wear these um
only on my eyelids I just think they
really do work well they don't work well
in the crease or anywhere else really
but they do work well if you use them as
a liner or on the island like I said
they're kind of creamy formula not the
most pigmented but they're pretty and I
do like this color combo so this is nude
rush so I like it all right i'll
probably just use those month on the
island because they're so nude but um
they do work well if you want to work
them under you know your lower lash line
on your upper lash line just don't
expect that kind of product to work into
your crease very well alright next I
picked up a knicks mega shine lipgloss
in la la so it's like a beautiful peachy
hot corley gorgeous color um I just love
it I just think it's very pretty very
very pretty so that is the color right
there perfect for summer really excited
for that I love the next glosses that's
already not gonna like that I also got
the what is that cover girl full lash
bloom mascara and 825 very black I've
heard some really really good things
about this and the brush looked like or
the wand looked like something that I
would like I like rubber ones on my
mascaras and I just thought i would like
this so let's take this out the
packaging and see what it's all about
right so very nice wand it just looks
like i don't know always nice full
bristles rubber just my kind of wand I
think I'm gonna like this a lot it looks
like a lot like the lash blast just the
regular like green thing but in a cute
little pink packaging but we'll see i'll
let you guys know about that one i also
picked up a l'oreal hips studio secrets
crystal shadow duo in
yes and it has these two really pretty
colors so you get that really nice like
white pearly color and that kind of
coppery tone there's the swatches really
really pretty I just thought it was
pretty do you guys remember when they
had all of like those hip products out
like they had like those jellies like
lip jellies and all these cool things
from l'oreal why did they keep some of
that stuff I really liked that opens up
you get a little applicator in the back
no mere don't really like that kind of a
waste of packaging but I do like the
shades next moving on I got to the new
maybelline fit me Matt post poreless fit
me foundation for normal to oily skin I
got it in 110 porcelain so this is my
shade um heard some good things heard
some bad things that I have to try it
out myself since it is drugstore and I
mean maybe I'll really like it we'll see
i tend i have combination skin but i
tend to get very very oily during the
summer and more dry during the winter so
right now this kind of weather is really
bring out my more oily side um so i
thought this one will be better to try
then the dewy one because they have two
different formulas I picked up a
covergirl lip lava and that's so nice
sticker right over the thing but can you
see that it's like this gorgeous
gorgeous like purpley pinky super shiny
gorgeous gorgeous lip gloss let's Wow oh
my oh my lordy look at that ah that is
beautiful this is the most beautiful
color I'm gonna have to pick some more
up these up I don't know love it it put
some on my lips
ooh I like that a lot this has like a
very very nice little tiny wand and you
can feel the glitter but like this is
obviously this kind of gloss is all
about the glitter because I mean look at
the packaging and it's called lip lava
but gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous really
like that probably have to pick some
more of those up um but when I'm trying
something for the first time like from
the line I like to just make sure I get
one just in case I don't like it next I
got to the NYC smooth skin BB radians
perfecting powder they have like two
shades which I thought was stupid and
this one is 02 warm beige which I knew
right away would not match my skin tone
however um I thought maybe I could do
some like just just to warm my skin up
like my actual skin tone this would be
nice and I think it will work for that
it's kind of a weird scent but the
finish of the powder is so nice and
smooth and creamy and if you have tried
and I seeds um Sonny it's just got that
great texture so I could definitely use
that as a bronzer on my skin tone but
however if you do have that kind of
color like your face is that kind of
color i highly recommend they recommend
picking this up because this would make
it great um like setting powder so next
I picked up two of the hard candy glow
all the way blushes they look like this
they are so beautiful the first one I
picked up was in punch 994 punch and it
is like a light highlight its got like
the lighter and then it kind of ombres
into that dark pink color really really
beautiful and when I swatch it I get
that kind of color ah oh my god you guys
know too pretty to pretty looks like I
don't even know but it's not gorgeous oh
my goodness love that so that's the
first 1i got and then I also got the
second one that actually looked really
really similar
the packaging I think the only thing
that's different is the highlight or
like that lighter color so the second
one is called sunburst and it's in 993
and it looks like this and it's got more
of like a yellowy highlights but AG
ombres into that dark pink again so just
gonna swatch that see what we got here
looks kind of similar but just a little
deeper you know so that's the color you
get with that one obviously they are
both gorgeous and I'm so excited to play
with them so totally my kind of blush
with the belt and highlight and
everything like that I think they're
just beautiful I mean really they didn't
have any more shades other than these
two um when I was looking but aren't
those beautiful like wow or just hope
they come out with maybe like a nice
coral or something that would be awesome
okay we're approaching the end next I
got the covergirl trublend liquid makeup
in l1 and this just looked like a nice
match for my skin tone and i think i
have tried this before and i liked it so
it doesn't have the most play if i
recall correctly doesn't have the
greatest coverage however has a nice
pump and it matched my skin so whatever
so I'm going to try that out again I
also got a NYX butter gloss and this one
is in apple strudel it's really really
gorgeous this like this nice Corley
shade it looks kind of similar to the
what is it the other next gloss I got
except that other one has more of like a
I'm going to see like a Corley pink
undertone this one's definitely more
like orange e so love those butter
glosses they're so good and the last
thing i got was the next jumbo eye
pencil in kashmir 6 30 which is a nice
gold color so that is it that was my
drugstore makeup ha i hope you guys
