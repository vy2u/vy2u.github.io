thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a great day today i
will be doing a drugstore makeup haul
for you guys i purchase everything on
the Ulta calm website they were having
like a lot of like drugstore makeup
deals so basically they would have like
buy one get two free or like unlike
every single drugstore brand so I
thought instead of going to like
Walgreens or something I just do the
drug store shopping through the online
website um and this is all makeup so I
will swatch everything that I can I got
a lot of mascaras obviously I'll show
you guys the ones but i'm not going to
swatch those that everything else i will
swatch most of this is new to me a few
are items that I'm like repurchasing but
overall most of it is new so let's just
get right into it all right okay the
first thing I picked up was the
Physicians Formula sexy booster cat I
collection mascara in ultra black 6415
and I thought the packaging on this was
like adorable it's like lace and read my
favorite colors red everybody thinks
it's pink but it's not it's red um but
my favorite color is red and I love red
and black together and I love lace
anything lights so I was super excited
to try this out this was like a really
good deal i think physicians formula
stuff was like buy one get one free or
buy one get one fifty percent off and
physicians formula it's like a little
more pricey at the drugstore so that was
nice that they were having such a good
deal oh my gosh you guys like ivory
painted my nails again because i was
looking at yesterday's video and they
looked horrible in their already
chipping again what can I say I just
cannot do nails all right sorry I'm
looking at this but this is the
packaging look you guys have like a
little stiletto and it's like velvet
like this is the best packaging ever so
um I've never really heard much about
this i'm mostly got it because of the
packaging but i definitely want to try
it out and this is totally my kind of
wand I like rubber bristle brushes like
this it's really nice and fat and it
looks like it has really really short
little bristles then it gets longer so
it's kind of tapered so super super
excited to try that out it's just the
normal formula not the waterproof one
alright the next thing I picked up oh I
was so excited about so I read
silly i did an alcohol a couple maybe i
don't know about a month ago three weeks
ago something like that and i picked up
this maybelline superstay better skin
foundation and i loved it but the shade
I thought on the online website for some
reason the lightest shade that they had
at that time was 15 which I think was
called like ivory or something and it
was much too pink on me and I really
really love the way it feels on the skin
is beautiful it has great coverage but
it was just not the right you know shade
match and I'd always try and make it
work and it just still looked not very
good especially now that we're going
into the cooler months i'm going to get
even paler so it's just I knew it wasn't
gonna work so when I was on the Alta com
website this time I saw that they do
have a lighter shade so this is the
lightest shade it must have been sold
out or something this is number 10
porcelain and this is a lovely lovely
foundation it just has such a nice like
texture it's so blendable it's got like
medium to full like buildable coverage
awesome so highly recommend checking
that out I also picked up another
foundation this is the Revlon Colorstay
whipped creme makeup these were I think
799 these are normally like 1499 so that
was like a really really great steal and
I don't know why they were so cheap it
wasn't like a Revlon sale hopefully this
isn't being discontinued but this is an
awesome product really really nice like
full coverage and the cream is easier to
work with like the creme formula is
easier to work within the normal formula
you really have to like put that on
quickly because it dries like paint on
your skin literally it's like tacky but
this one's like really nice really
really blendable I had one of these and
then when I was in the process of moving
and I unpacked all my foundations the
lid had broken off and I just couldn't
get the lid back on and I started to dry
out so I had to toss it so I picked up
another one of these I absolutely love
this this is in 110 ivory all right ok I
have been wanting these forever this and
I thought the perfect time to get them
was now because like I said physicians
formula was buy one get one fifty
percent off so this is the physicians
formula Matt collection quad I shadows
I've heard that these are dupes for the
naked basics 1 and 2 I have both a naked
basics I really really like them
but I thought like how cool that at the
drugstore you can get little quads like
of neutral neutral matte colors and
emilynoel83 and tons of people rave
about these and I don't know why it took
me so long to pick them up so the first
one I got is classic nudes and this is
more warm toned so I will swatch these
oh it's got the nice little cookie
little packaging so you get the little
sponge tip applicator and then these are
the four shades you get so these are
more warm like in color let me go ahead
and swatch them oh my gosh they feel so
buttery and nice Wow alright so those
like that Wow look at that white really
nice all right let's see here let's see
what you got oh they feel really really
good you guys like on the skin they look
like that but they're really really nice
and soft they feel like they're gonna be
really easy to blend and you can't go
wrong with just like a neutral color
like this like literally this color like
the white on the lid and then one of
these colors in the crease it's like so
easy it's just it's too easy so I'm
definitely excited to play with that one
and then the other one I got is in
Canyon classics a lot of people talk
about this one um mama loves mascara
here on YouTube boy love also talks
about this one I believe in emilynoel83
like i said i don't know i'm like so
late like on the bandwagon zygier's so
late on the bandwagon i need to get on
the bandwagon i'm on it now alright so
this is just the same thing but it's a
little more like cool toned and again so
nice you know beautiful mats all right
let me swatch these ones wow they really
feel nice and smooth you guys and creamy
can't believe I didn't pick these up
sooner alright let's see here I'm sure
these probably build really nicely with
a primer hopefully you guys can see that
but really really excited to play with
those I feel like you know like I said
you just can't go wrong with like a
neutral little Matt quad especially when
they're by wouldn't get one fifty
percent off you know alright moving on I
picked up the Maybelline lash discovery
mascara I've never been able to find
this that like Duane Reade or CVS
anything like
and emilynoel83 here on YouTube talks
about it all the time it's like a really
really tiny little brush so it's great
for the lower lashes and I got the shade
351 very black so it is just the normal
formula and let me show you guys the
wand because it's awesome it's kind of
like the Justin clinique you have one
like this to that has a really tiny
little skinny wand but yeah they have
this on the alto calm website I've never
been able to find it in New York like I
couldn't find it at Wayne read and here
in Wisconsin I can't find it anywhere
but they had it on the alt rock on
website so I'm excited to try that out
because honestly I always get smudges
underneath like from where like I put my
mascara on the lower lashes it's just
I'm just sloppy with my mascara all
right another master i just love nest
there with you guys this is the
physicians formula organic where a jumbo
lash mascara i have like the pink one
yeah i have the one that's pig and I got
that one because of the pink and it's
shiny and pretty and shiny things
distract me but overall um has a nice
little wand I felt like it kind of like
built up like volume nicely but I was
watching glam glam life guru here on
YouTube tati and she was saying this is
one of her all-time favorites drugstore
mascaras and it has to be this one in
the green tube she said all the other
ones are not as good so I thought I
would try it out since of course like I
said everything was buy one get one
fifty percent off and that's worth it
you know like Physicians Formula tends
to be a little pricey so you want to
wait until you can get you know more
bang for your buck so this is the
packaging super super cute and I believe
it's a rubber bristle yes okay my kind
of wand again that's what it looks like
really really chubby tiny little
bristles rubber super super excited to
try this out you guys it's so like
compact it's kind of sleek isn't it
super cute alright moving on I got a
let's see here all may smart shade
butter kiss these are like they're
butter kiss lipsticks I can't remember
if I have this shade or not I have two
shades and I'm in the process of
unpacking all my makeup and putting it
to New like storage and I can't remember
if I have this shade but it doesn't
matter if i do i love the formula piece
they're basically like the revlon
lip butters they're like the same
formula but they're just you know they
feel so nice and they're such a pleasure
to wear really so this one is in pink
light medium 60 I can't remember if I
have this one but it's just a oh god
I've to take this little thing off
packaging you guys um but yeah it's like
such a nice formula and honestly the
shade is just very very neutral and a
lot of shades that I would you guys will
see I was picking up we're very very
like deep and dark so I thought I should
probably get like a nice pinky color so
this is the color super super pretty I
really really like that and again the
formula is absolutely luscious and
gorgeous and amazing so if you have all
of the lip butters like I do from Revlon
and you want more colors in this same
kind of like you know formula is sort of
thing different brands go check out the
only ones all right I picked up one of
the baby lips moisturizing lip glosses I
haven't heard good things but I love
baby lips just like the original baby
lips so I had to pick one up this one is
in mmm does it say do you have a name
yes no um oh my gosh you guys seriously
oh there it is 10 a wink of pink and
it's like a like neutral medium pink
with tons and tons of like like
holographic glitter like it changes in
the lighting so let's watch this and
again I haven't heard great things about
these but I love the baby lips is
actually really pretty this will be very
nice on top of like a matte lipstick I
feel like it would give tons and tons of
like dimension to the lips oh no scent
okay they don't smell as good as the
original baby lips um alright moving on
I picked up another mascara because you
know I mean I don't know this is the
Revlon Photoready 3d volume and again
this is something I can't find in drug
store I've heard a few things I only
found it on the alto website but this is
in 001 blackest black this is not the
waterproof formula it's normal um but
yeah really cute like sleek packaging I
like that looks like that can't remember
what this one looks like oh yes it looks
like the
what does it look like benefits they're
real kind of one that's what it looks
like it's got two little points at the
top nice rubber bristle brush lots of
different little spiky you know yeah
like that really looks like um maybe
I'll have to do like a comparison I
wonder if it's similar alright well
we'll see what the formulas like with
that I'm really excited to try all these
mascaras let's see here I picked up a
Revlon Colorstay moisture stayin in 005
Parisian and I have never tried these
and it just sounded so like nice you
know like moisture stain it sounds so
comfortable so this is kind of like a
deeper kind of fall color um which I'm
totally and do so let's see what this
looks like okay so it looks like that
and I sort of like doe foot applicator
ooh very pretty it looks like it kind of
like shears out but if it really leaves
a stain that's gonna leave a gorgeous
stain I love these kind of like
raspberry shades I don't know i love the
way those look especially for fall
beautiful and it feels so nice Wow does
that sound lovely to moisture stain all
right I picked up another one of the
maybelline master drama by I studio
cream eye liners in Midnight master this
is like one of the best drugstore
eyeliners you can get if you want
something to wear for a very long time
in your waterline this is the blackest
black it is like a kool cuz all kind of
pencil like it goes on so smooth and
creamy but it doesn't smudge so it's
amazing you should definitely pick it up
and it's a very dark it's right there
amazing i love this um i gave one to my
mom i had an extra one I gave it to her
and then I was like oh gosh i buy
another one so anyway any last thing i
got with another a Revlon um revlon was
probably having like a by Woodkid one
fifty percent off too because i feel
like i bought like just random little
products from them but this is the
Colorstay ultimate suede lipstick I've
seen these before I never tried them
haven't heard tons about them but again
I got kind of like a fall color this is
in
it doesn't say I swear it doesn't say
it's like this deep deep deep pretty
like plummy color with some shimmer in
it so let's watch that ooh that feels
nice well that's a really buttery Wow so
those are the two revlon's next to each
other that's this one and this one has a
lovely texture you guys wow that feels
really nice okay I'm excited so yeah
anyway that was my drugstore makeup haul
from Ulta com they're still having all
of these deals going on so if you go
onto the you know website and you can oh
you can shop through ebates to you guys
should do that um because you do
actually get money back if you shop
through ebates um I don't have like over
for a link or anything like that it's
not sponsored you guys it's not even
actually like I actually got like a
three-hundred-dollar check from them
last month it's amazing I do too much on
Jeffy you guys ah goodness um but anyway
they still like have these deals going
on I think they have like 21 days of
beauty kind of thing going on again

definitely go on to the ultimate website
and check some of these out I think
especially for like Revlon and like
L'Oreal you know their prices have kind
of gone up in physicians formula it's
nice to get like two products for the
price of one or like buy one get one
fifty percent off or nicks was like buy
one get two free that's awesome so
