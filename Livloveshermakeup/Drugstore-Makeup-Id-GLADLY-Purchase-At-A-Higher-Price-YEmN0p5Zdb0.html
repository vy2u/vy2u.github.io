ponytail and I'm so used to having a bun
back there and it just feels strange to
have something tickling the back of my
neck of it anyway hi guys welcome back
to my channel so today we are going to
be talking all about drugstore makeup
products that I would gladly purchase at
a higher price now I'm in no way shape
or form saying that these brands should
up their prices please don't don't
listen to me I don't know what I am
saying is that if they happen to up the
prices I would be ok with it there are a
lot of drugstore makeup products that so
loli have crept up in price and a lot of
them I'm not cool with I'm like no you
should be a cheaper price than that and
I have done a video all about repressing
certain beauty products where I kind of
lower the price on items I'll go ahead
and throw that up in the cards but yeah
today let's talk about some really
really good at drugstore makeup products
that literally could be in the 15 20 25
dollar mark or range and I would still
buy them the first product that we have
here from the drugstore are obviously
the Wet n Wild mega glow highlighting a
powders my three favorite shades are
definitely golden flower crown which is
a light gold a bellossom glow which is a
light mid-tone kind of pinky shade as
well as precious petals which is more of
a rose gold I can use all three of these
to highlight especially if I am the self
tanner I definitely can get into
precious petals if I'm not self tanned
like currently I'm not I will use
precious petals as a blush topper and
these are gorgeous and absolutely I
would pay fifteen to twenty dollars for
these a little swatch of precious petals
hopefully you guys can see that I know
that with the window open it's a little
more light reflective but this is just
gorgeous they go on really really glossy
very very wet if you want that wham bam
of my life like in your face kind of
blinding glow these are definitely some
highlighters that I would recommend you
guys check out alright let's move on to
two concealers from the drugstore that
are phenomenal the first one I
talked about yesterday it's the Wet n
Wild photo focused concealer I love this
the shade that I have is light ivory a
lot of you were telling me in
yesterday's video that I should check
out the color pop concealers so I'm
gonna do that next but yeah this retails
for I think I got it for 399 at the
drugstore which was pretty darn cheap
I cannot remember if I had a coupon or
not but about 399 5.99 $4.99 something
like that but that is what it looks like
swatched on my hand has a nice little
doe foot applicator I love this
underneath the eyes it does not
in any way shape or form it really goes
on nicely and I also is good for spot
concealing so I love that concealer and
I would gladly pay at least 15 20 bucks
for that and then when it comes to the
Milani retouched bracelet lifting
concealer I would literally pay almost
$30 for this this does not act like a
drugstore concealer in any way shape or
form I a lot of you have been saying
lately you know what concealer are you
wearing underneath your eyes your eyes
look really nice and smooth well I
recently purchased this and when I did a
drugstore haul and I'm so incredibly
impressed with it the shade I wear zero
to light which is a little more yellow
tone I don't love the shade selection
that's going on however my friends in
Orem who does have a very very deep
complexion said that the darkest shade
of the concealer does work for her and
she's very very dark so I'm happy to
hear that at least the darker shades are
working a for a darker skin tone these
are just gorgeous I feel like they go on
so beautifully again they do not crease
in any way shape or form if you need
something a little more hydrating over
the a photo focus concealer I would
definitely recommend going with this if
you have mature eyes if you have a lot
of fine lines and wrinkles a lot of
creasing a lot of creepiness underneath
the eyes this is a great concealer
alright should we talk about some
drugstore powders I think we should it
is going to come as absolutely no
surprise if you watch my channel
frequently and that I'm talking about
the essence all about Matt fixing
compact powder as well as the elf tone
correcting powder and cool in this
particular video so in the ELF powder
gives me the elf powder as you can see
I'm already panning at this one I would
definitely pay $20 for this and I know
I'm the queen of saying I love the fact
that this is 399 but this is my all-time
favorite setting powder my only issue
with this guy is that lately when I do
self tan and this does look a little
ashy or a little chalky on my skin and
this is really best for those of you who
do have a fair to light complexion so if
I do go in with two or three layers of
self-tanner I'm kind of screwed and I
can't use this setting powder but I love
the packaging I love the fact that it is
very cheap they used to have an elf tone
correcting powder in warm and I was
hoping to pick that up for when I am
self tan but unfortunately they don't
sell that anymore so that was really
disappointing but this is a very finely
milled powder I love it for setting in
my makeup even when I had combo skin
oily skin and dry skin it is a great one
and then here we have the essence all
about Matt fixing contact powder again
probably best for those of you who do
have a fear to like complex
this can give a little bit of flashback
I just finished it off this morning so
sorry if it's super powdery I'll go
ahead and rinse that out and then pop it
in my empties video for this month it
does remind me a lot of the bye bye
pours in depressed aversion however they
buy my pours pressed version from it
cosmetics just have a little bit of a
yellow tint to it and it does kind of
look better on the majority of skin
tones but this guy is really cheap 399 I
believe that they are going to be making
at different shades of this or at least
that is the rumor that I have heard so
that's going to be fantastic will be
really really cool but yeah I do enjoy
this a lot I had to include it in the
video I would definitely pay $10 for
this $20 for the elf tone correcting
powder and cool and finally guys I have
a couple of elf pallets here as well
that I wanted to mention the first one
is the illuminating palette this is
great for a multitude of different skin
tones it has a mirror and these are
actually you know interchangeable so you
can pop them out and mix and match it
with different palettes from algo
whether it be the bronzer palette the
contour palette the blush palettes
really really fantastic that these
powders remind me a lot of the old
formula of the hourglass ambient
lighting powders I know recently
hourglass has been infused in some
glitter particles in a to a dim light as
well as I believe it's diffused light
but this is a great way to get that seen
this sort of a blurring powder look
great for setting the under-eye a great
for giving a natural highlight without
having to pay in the high price point so
that is the help illuminating palette
and then here we have the total face
glow palette this again is just
absolutely beautiful if you do have a
really deep complexion this may not be
the right shade selection for you but I
reach for this a lot when I fair
complected when I have more of a light
complexion when I do south tan but they
are coming out with a darker version of
this which is very very exciting so
they're gonna have a more deeper kind of
berry shades as well as a highlight any
deep a bronzer so I don't know exactly
when they're releasing that but I can
see a little newsletter the other day
from ELF so I thought I would go ahead
and mention that it really really
gorgeous finely milled powders I love
the highlight in here I love the peachy
kind of blushes really good quality and
I would definitely purchase this for $30
not even kidding so anyway guys that is
it for a drugstore makeup that I would
gladly purchase at a higher price please
let me know down below what drugstore
makeup you would gladly purchase at a
higher price and I guess I'll see you
guys tomorrow
