I'm going to be reviewing the new royal
treatment the ultimate nourishing kit
from Drybar this is a set of excuse me
five different hair products that come
in here you get this for $49 it's a $67
value but you get this for $49 on the
Sephora website I will link below where
you guys can pick it up but anyway
inside here you get the sake bomb
nourishing shampoo a sake bomb a
nourishing conditioner the mudslide
nourishing hair mask the hot toddy heat
and UV protectant and the hundred proof
treatment oils so yes these are all
named after the look like alcoholic
beverages I actually think that's really
really cute I do like it so anyway let
me show you guys what you get in here so
like I said you get five products yes I
had to use them I just wanted to put
them back in the packaging so you guys
could see what it all looked like so
let's just talk about the first thing
this is the sake bomb nourishing shampoo
you get a nice size of this and you can
see that I have used it all of the
products I'm gonna say right away have a
really interesting scent um yeah I don't
even know how to describe this I don't
know if this is a signature dry bar
scent because I actually have never
tried anything from dry bar that's why I
really wanted to pick up this kit but
it's not a lot like I don't know maybe a
little bit like cardamom like kind of
like a spicy but almost
maybe a little chemically I'm not quite
sure how to explain it however I don't
absolutely love the scent however I was
using it when I was using it in the
shower I've used all of these products
two or three times by the way so I would
say for about a week and a half I've
been using them and I showered in a week
and a half about three shower to wash my
hair about three times in a week and a
half so anyway so like I said it smells
kind of interesting when I was abusing
the shampoo the first time in the shower
I really was like oh my god I hate the
way this smells like I really just don't
like the way it smelled I think it
smells odd it's weird
however by the time I got to the hundred
proof treatment oil which is the last
item in the little kit I was like wow I
really like this
so it's one of those sense that I don't
think it's gonna be appealing to a lot
of people however it grows on you like I
like it now so not quite sure about that
but all of them smell like that all the
products in the kitchen so you know like
I said I don't know if that's like a
Drybar signature scent or something but
um I like it now so anyway let's talk
about the sake bomb nourishing shampoo
and by the way all the things on the
back say how to serve because it's like
alcoholic beverage so cute anyway so it
says apply generous dollop to the roots
massage vigorously from roots to ends
rinse well repeat if needed obvious
first shampoo anyway so when I was using
this in the shower um I really noticed
how thick and creamy and luxurious it
felt it really really just felt like I
was putting almost like almost like a
conditioner through my hair it did not
lather up very nicely I really like a
shampoo that lather is really really
well please leave a comment below if you
know of a shampoo that's like amazing at
lathering cuz right now I'm using a swag
one that I absolutely love however I
want to try something different next so
let me look let me know below if you
have a recommendation but overall like I
said it's very very nice and it feels
luxurious and it really feels like it is
nourishing hair however it just didn't
lather to the amount that I would like
you to um however I will obviously
finish this up I think these are gonna
be perfect for travel I may use them up
and just use them for travel because
they are the perfect size so I don't
think I would purchase a full size of
the shampoo so
yeah anyway moving on we have the sake
bomb nourishing conditioner it looks
like this same packaging same scent and
it says how to serve on the back and I
really really liked this one so unlike
the shampoo this one really really just
felt nice and well now not unlike the
shampoo the shampoo was really nice and
nourishing this also felt very
nourishing I noticed that this detangled
my hair I really get tangles from about
here to the ends this really detangled
nicely um I didn't feel like I needed my
comb to comb through it detangled really
really well and it was really really
creamy and nice and almost felt like a
mask like it's a really really nice
texture so really really liked it the
sake bomb nourishing conditioner I would
definitely consider picking up a full
size of this um only thing I'm worried
about is that I'm gonna run out of this
before this but that's just normal I
always run out of conditioner before my
shampoo next in here you have the
mudslide nourishing hair masque it says
it deeply moisturizers and help
strengthen dry damaged hair and it says
how to serve on the back after
shampooing apply a generous dollop
through wet hair from mid-shaft to ends
comb through and leave in for 5 to 10
minutes then rinse well so I did use
this in conjunction with the conditioner
I used the conditioner first and then I
went in with this I actually felt that
the conditioner detangled better and
actually had a nicer texture than the
actual hair masque the hair mask was
nice it was thick like I said I has that
signature smell that all the products
have and it was nice and I did notice
when I combed through that it almost
tangled my hair a little more like if I
had just left it with the conditioner I
feel like my hair would have been really
really nicely detangle however this one
kind of knotted it up just a little bit
towards the end I did leave it in for
about five to ten minutes and I did comb
it through with a wide toothed comb in
the shower um but I just noticed that I
didn't like this as much as I liked some
of my other deep conditioning mask so I
would not get a full size of the
mudslide
next we have the hot toddy heat and UV
protectant it says it protects hair up
to 450 degrees Fahrenheit and it helps
repair split ends and prevent damage it
says on the back how to serve apply a
small dollop to day
hair from roots to ends use sparingly on
fine hair and style as usual so I did
use this I don't normally use heat on my
hair maybe once a week I'd say so I did
use this um and I did blow-dry my hair
by the way I used all of this for the
third time last night so I did use this
last night I used about a dollop size
and I rubbed through and I used it from
my roots all the way to my ends the
other times you know I've used these
products these products three times now
the two times before I did not actually
use this one because I just don't heat
style my hair very often like I said
maybe once a week and I just didn't feel
like using it he told my hair three
times a week especially because I've
been coloring my hair a lot so what I
did was I took about us you know like
they said a small dollop of it I put it
all through my roots all the way to the
ends and I blow dried it and it really
really felt nice like it felt really
good and I'm not quite sure if that's
because they also had the oil in I'll
get to that next but this was really
nice I don't know um I I like the
thought of heat protectants every time I
blow dry my hair however I don't know if
they actually work this is great if it
works up to 450 degrees that's awesome
um I did notice that even like the
product I could even use it on my roots
and it didn't get oily which is crazy
because I do have fine hair so I thought
that was really really great um so yeah
I would consider purchasing this hot
toddy for a heat-protective and the last
thing is the 100 proof treatment oil it
comes like this in a little pump and it
says it eliminates frizz and flyaways
while creating lasting shine for the
perfect blowout
it says rub two to three pumps in two
palms and applied to damp or dry hair
use lightly on fine hair so I actually
used four pumps of this every single
time and I put it from about here to my
ends and like I said last night I did
blow-dry and I felt that my ends looked
nice and sleek after I had this in there
and also the hot toddy but I thought my
ends looked especially nice and it was
probably because of the oil I feel like
this is gonna last me forever because
like I said it's an oil and oils are
last forever whether you put them on
your face or your hair so this will last
me a long time and I do like it has the
signature scent that all the other ones
have it says it is paraben sulfates and
fat like free sink for color-treated
pairs that's great and yeah I would
purchase a full-size of this hundred
proof treatment oil I did like it
so overall um out of the five products
and you know like I said this was $49
for the five products so basically $10 a
piece I would definitely purchase a
full-size of a sake bomb nourishing
conditioner
I would definitely purchase the hot
toddy heat and UV protectant 2 full-size
of that and I would definitely purchase
the hundred proof treatment oil so I
would purchase three out of the five for
me that's worth it I really thought the
kid was worth it because I ended up
finding three new hair products that I
really like I would not get the
nourishing shampoo or the mudslide
nourishing hair masque I just find that
I have better shampoos and I have found
better take conditioning hair mask but
anyway I'm gonna read for you guys a
little bit about what it says on the
support website it says Drybar the royal
treatment
the ultimate nourishing kit $49 it is a
$67 value it says what it is a curated
assortment of Drybar products by founder
Ali Wehbe to pamper nourish and hydrate
your hair from start to finish what it
is formulated to do these nourishing and
hydrating products are perfect for
pampering dry damaged and lackluster
hair and help achieve a flawless blowout
at home sake bog nourishing shampoo and
conditioner will soften dry damaged hair
while providing moisture shine and
smoothness mud side nourishing hair
masque deeply moisturizes and nourishes
hair making it more lustrous with
improved resilience and then I said hot
toddy and UV protectant protects hair
from up to 450Â° and UV exposure while
helping to seal split ends and the
hundred proof treatment oil eliminates
frizz and flyaways improving hydration
and smoothest for soft touchable hair
and it says what it is formulated
without parabens sulfates and bad lights
and what else you need to know all
products and royal treatment kits are
gluten free so anyway that was my review
and my thoughts on
the new little ultimate nourishing kit
from Drybar the Royal Treatment like I
said I like three out of the five
products so I think that's like a win in
my book I would definitely purchase
three out of the five and yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed this review I'll see
you my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
