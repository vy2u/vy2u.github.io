today's video is going to be a dupes and
comparison video on the new big blush
book - from Tarte this has recently sold
out - we have no idea if it's actually
coming back for the holiday season but I
didn't review this and I told you guys
that I thought there were quite a few
shades in here that could easily be
duped out at the drugstore I did find
five really really good options to share
with you guys I did pop those particular
shades out and then the other three that
I couldn't find exact dupes for I did
find dupes in other blush palettes from
Tarte so I'm gonna go ahead and share
those with you guys today the gipset I
found from the drugstore are dreamy
breathless soulful lively and perky and
then the dupes that I found in other
holiday pallets or just other blush
palettes were feisty quirky and thrilled
so let's go ahead and start with the
drugstore drew drew dupes
alright we're gonna start with the
drugstore droops and we're gonna start
with the shade dreamy so here is the
shade dreamy it's a beautiful beautiful
kind of Mavi color and the shade that I
found that is they do for that is from
the Milani rose powder blush collection
in the shade t Rose so there they are
side by side and I will swatch the tart
on top and then I will do the Milani on
the bottom and I feel like the Milani
maybe has a little more kick up but for
the most part I feel like these are very
similar so here we have the tart and
then here is the Milani so there is
dreamy and there is tea rose
alright I'm moving on the next one that
I am going to do for you guys is the
shade called lively lively is like a
deep hot kind of coral color and this is
what lively looks like it's almost like
a mid-tone pink with a little bit of
coral and they shade that I found a dupe
for is in this elf blush palette this is
in the light version and that is the
duper right there they may not look
similar side-by-side in the actual pan
however they do it when you actually
swatch them out so on top we have the
tart and then on the bottom we have the
elf there they are so tart and elf
alright moving on it the next one that
we are going to go ahead and do is the
shade called soulful so soulful is more
of a cool toned pink which I feel like
is something that we consistently see in
Tarte palette
again the dupe that I found is in that
blush palette from elf in the light
version and it is that one down there so
let's go ahead at your hands so watch a
boo I'm going to swatch on the other
side on the other hand this time all
right let me know if you guys like with
dupe videos if you're okay with me likes
watching it on camera or if you want me
to have them prepared because I know
it's kind of a lot of work likes
watching them out but here is the tart
and here is the elf and by that I just
mean like already have them so watched
out on my arm ahead of time so yeah
there is the shade a soulful and then we
have the elf on the bottom very very
consistent with color and also with
finish alright so moving on the next one
that we are going to go ahead and do is
the shade called breathless and this one
is an exact like perfect dupe and I
found let's see here the elf weight not
this one is a dupe this one is the dupe
this is the elf studio blush in the
shade peachy keen they have the same
exact color tone and also the same exact
finish they have a little bit more
what's it called like they have like a
little more shimmer or glitter I guess
you could say but they're very very
similar you guys like seriously it's
freakishly similar so on the top we have
at the tarts and then on the bottom we
have peachy keen from ELF
I feel like peachy keen from ELF it's a
little more powdery but nothing crazy
but yeah very very similar right there
and then the last one that we are going
to go ahead and dupe is the shade called
perky and perky is like a very very very
hot coral so this one right here which
was lively is also kind of a hot coral
but more of like a medium toned pink
this one straight-up hot coral and the
shade that I found that is a dupe for
this is from Jordana and it is their
$2.99 blush $2 and $0.99 blush in the
shade coral radiance when you hold them
up together they don't look identical at
all but they swatch out completely
completely similar so on the top we have
at the Tarte and then here is the coral
radiance and I actually feel like the
Jordana has a better actual like formula
than this Tarte one so here is coral
radiance from Jordana and here is the
Tarte and then also I went ahead
I wanted to show you guys as well this
Maybelline master glaze by say studio
stick if you do have dry skin and you
want a cream blush that's the same sort
of color but with a little more Sheen
this one is out so very similar so there
is the Maybelline and then also in the
Milani rose powder blush in the shade
Coral Cove is very similar as well and
that looks like that and I will show you
guys let's watch a little one that so
there they all are so here we have the
tarts here we have the Jordana if
there's the Maybelline and then there is
the Milani I have really bad swatches
but hopefully you guys can see
everything alright so those are the
drugstore dupes that I found now we are
going to move on to the actual palette
and I will share with you guys the three
dupes that I found for feisty thrilled
and also quirky they're not technically
dupes because they're not cheaper but
they are like comparable so the first
one we are going to go ahead and do pout
is from the tarts what is this called
bling it on Amazonian clay blush palette
so this one was I think this was the
2015 yeah it was a 2015 holiday palette
and the shade that I found that is very
similar to thrilled which is this one
right here kind of like a cool toned
nudie color this is thrilled from the
big blush book too I found that the
shade prim is very very similar so
they're very very similar to each other
here is the thrilled shade and then here
is the prim shade prim might have a
little more cool undertones going on but
I feel like they actually swatch out
pretty much identical so there is the
shade thrilled and there is prim from
the 2015 holiday palette alright moving
on we are going to go ahead and we are
going to find a similar or comparable
color to the shade spice tea there is
the sheet of spiced tea and the one that
I found that is very very very similar
is this one right here this is called
love from the tortoise blush palette so
there's love let's go ahead and swatch
that one and then here is feisty God I
have so much blushes in front of me and
they're all our dies alright so here is
feisty no wait
yes feisty and love
on the top we have feisty and then we
have love on the bottom feisty might be
a little darker in tone so feisty and
then love but very very similar and if
you really like that color and you have
the tortoise palette like I said you
probably already have it and then the
last one we have is quirky and quirky is
kind of like a hot peachy quarterly
color and the dupe that I found or these
similar comparable shade is in the
holiday 2014 palette and the shade is
right there and I lost the little slip
so I don't know the exact shape name but
they do swatch out pretty much identical
so there we have the 2014 holiday
palette and then there is quirky from
the big blush book too so anyway that
those are kind of the dupes or the
comparable finds that I found the
comparable finds it's already been a
long day and it's only like 7 a.m. you
guys but anyway those are the comparable
products that I found or dupes from the
drugstore that I found for the charts a
big blush book - I hope you guys enjoyed
this video thank you so much for joining
me and I will see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
