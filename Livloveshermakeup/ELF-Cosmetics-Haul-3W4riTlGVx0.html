thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a fantastic day
please excuse please excuse please
excuse my voice today it's a little
raspy I think I'm coming down with
something honestly it really hope not
but I think I am but anyway today I have
an alcohol for you guys I went on to the
elf calm website and ordered some
goodies and I thought I would just share
you know what I got with you guys and
also do any swatches on camera if you
know applicable if I can swatch the item
I'm gonna swatch them alright let's get
started the first couple of things I
picked up I picked up because my friend
leora did a video on these and they
looked amazing she did lip swatches and
arms watches they are the elf lip kiss
bombs there were a few shades that
didn't really interest me and I was kind
of like whatever you know but there were
a few in there that I liked so basically
there's these are just like tinted lip
balms kind of like baby lips or
something like that um and it seemed
like they were very very pigmented when
she was doing her review so anyway the
first color i got is called x 0 red and
open us up probably should have done
this off camera because i'm gonna spend
the whole video doing this now okay get
out of there already alright this is
what it looks like I think the packaging
is adorable it says elf and silver and
then it has the color of whatever lip
balm color it is and they smell like
mint which I really like I really like
men so I don't mind that what was that
I'm just about anyways it smells like
mint I really like it and this is the
color the XO read it and I'm going to go
ahead and swatch it for you guys Wow
very pigmented can you guys see that oh
my gosh super super pigmented for a like
a lip balm that's pretty awesome so that
is X 0 read the next one I got is called
pouty raspberry and again I kind of got
colors that I thought would go well like
this time of year and I tend to go more
for reds and berries than been dude
colors
like a really light pink color which
looked cute and it looks really pretty
on my friend Lee auras lips however i
just looked dead when I we're really
really like pink colors like that all
right they all smell the same this is
pouty raspberry it's a little more of a
darker pink swatch that and they seem
nice they don't feel like they're super
super like super super glossy like the
baby lips they are glossy but they seem
to have like a little bit of texture to
them so that's great because that means
they're going to stay on the lips quite
well so there is pouty raspberry and XO
red and then the third one I got is
called smoochy spice and I thought this
was the perfect color for fall winter
all these kind of months you know um my
god knows why are these ones so hard to
open usually L stuff is not that
difficult to open can't bring a moment
such a battle with this well Ben um so
anyway this is kind of like a I would
save mah be spicy kind of like such a
spice from Babel a natural color you
know your lips but better sort of
whatever tone that is what it looks like
beautiful watch that one as well that's
a very pretty color it's not as
pigmented I would say the first one was
the most pigmented the XO red color
there is smoochy spice can you see it's
kind of got like that um your lips but
better sort of undertones that makes
sense a little bit of mob and like tan
mixed together all right and then the
last one I got is called very sweet and
this is more of a very purpley color or
at least it appears to me and I believe
these were each either three or six
dollars I feel like the prices are going
up on L products oh this one's really
nice I like this color so there is that
one that's the berry one beautiful so
I'm really excited to use these I love
the smell of mint I think they're
packaged really nicely and I think
they're going to stay on quite a while
because they're not super super crazy
glossy but really really pretty colors
the swatches and we can continue on
alright the next thing I got were two of
the one dollar lipsticks these are
called be what are they called I think
they just call them like the mineral
lipsticks or something like that they
are the one dollar ones that have these
silver packaging this color is called
posh and it looks like this it was
screaming my name can you see that very
pretty go ahead and swatch it oh and
these glide on really nicely these one
dollar lipsticks are just as good as the
three dollar ones to be completely
honest so there it is beautiful
beautiful color can't wait to play with
that one and then I also got a sociable
and this one has a little more red in it
I believe Susheela yep a little more
read a little more pinky toned I'm like
moving up my arm Oh a little more pink a
tinge of red so there is sociable you
see that very very very pretty you guys
and I can't believe that those are one
dollar because they really do last a
while on the lips I have the one called
classy which I believe is a Mac dupe and
it is amazing it's a beautiful beautiful
color so I really like those the next
thing I picked up or take it two or
three two of the new lip exfoliator I
love the original lip exfoliator from
Alf it's like a lipstick tube and you
just basically run it over your lips and
it exfoliates your lips beautifully it
kind of tastes a little sweet um but I
saw that on the website they actually
had flavors now so i picked up the mint
maniac and sweet cherries let me show
you guys what they look like they look
exactly like if you have the original
one which is just see i think it's
called clear i think that's how they put
it on the website it looks exactly like
that except the bottom has the color or
like whatever the name is of the product
so interesting it doesn't look as grainy
can you guys see that I don't know if
you guys have
the elf lip exfoliator the regular one
but it has like a lot more grains in it
all but this does to their just clear Oh
smells really good oh I can't wait to
use this oh yes yes yes yes yes I love
lip exfoliator so I know I'm gonna love
that and then I got the one in sweet
cherry I help at that time was really
really good why don't we just throw in
this packaging on the floor um and that
one has like a little kind of pinky face
oh that's really good and again it has
the same sort of like exfoliation feel
as the original one except you can't see
the little beads if that makes sense
you'd only understand if you have the
original lip exfoliator there's like
little particles in there like little I
don't know little sugar scrubs or
something like that so alright next I
got some of the mist and set products I
got the original one because this was
the first setting spray that I ever used
in my life I used to like a senior in
high school I specifically remember
using this I love it it really does make
your makeup last longer so um this is
just the original one it has sort of an
interesting scent but it really does
make your makeup lasts all day and then
I saw on the website that they had two
new ones so one is an illuminating one
and the other one is Matt so the
illuminating one um I don't really know
what the difference is in here I guess
this has doesn't really say it says the
famous creates a natural looking glow on
the skin with ultra fine light
reflecting particles for an illuminating
effect but it was a siiii in green tea
so it looks like it probably has just a
little bit of like illuminating like
they said particles in it and then the
mat 1 i'm guessing probably has a little
more alcohol in it it has aloe vera
green tea cucumber vitamins a c and e
it's probably the green tea in there
that's going to Kiki mat so I'm really
excited to try those because I do love
the original mist and set so we will see
with those um I've picked up two more
packs of these elf studio makeup remover
cleansing cloths I love these these are
amazing at removing make
they are really really moist which I
love some people say that these burn on
their eyes I've never actually had that
issue but they smell really good and
they're super super cheap and cheerful
so I love those and then the last two
things I picked up I can't believe I
never got these before these are the
blush pallets in light and dark so this
is light and in here they have like
those convertible if you I don't know if
you've tried their contouring palette or
their illuminating palette or their
bronzer palette you have like these
shades that you can actually pop out so
you can mix and match your own palette
but this is the light one really really
beautiful beautiful colors in there
let's go ahead and swatch it it looks
like three of them are Matt and one has
shimmer you guys see that so the bottom
to look amazing super super pigmented
like crazy pigmented so I'm really
excited to use these I've heard so many
good things I believe these are six
dollars on the health website but I have
seen them in target as well and then the
dark one this is just basically darker
colors I thought to be perfect for fall
and winter and this one looks like this
look at those gorgeous colors and again
you have three mats and one shimmering
shimma shimma recolor sure ha whoa baby
super super super pigmented let's go
ahead and swash those beautiful I cannot
wait to play with those you guys know I
love blush and I don't know why I held
off on those for so long i heard such
great things and I just probably because
I knew that my blush collection is
overflowing but now that I've done my
declutter series i have room for more
stuff so anyway that's what's my alcohol
I hope you guys enjoyed this video if
you did please give it a thumbs up and
I'll see you my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
