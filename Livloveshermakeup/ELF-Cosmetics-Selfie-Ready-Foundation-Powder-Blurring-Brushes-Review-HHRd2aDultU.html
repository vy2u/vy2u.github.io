thank you so much for joining me I hope
you guys are having a fantastic day um I
want to say really quickly my thoughts
and my prayers even though I'm not a
religious person my thoughts and warmth
you know warm good happy feelings
basically I guess you could say prayers
whatever are definitely in Paris today
in France for all the people that have
lost loved ones for everything that's
going on there my thoughts are with them
anyway continuing on I am doing a review
today for you guys on two new brushes
that I found on the elf comm website
they are the elf selfie ready powder
blurring brush and the selfie ready
foundation blurring brush these were $6
apiece
on the elf comm website and I was like
oh I'm really really curious to try
these out so I'm going to start with my
review on the selfie ready foundation
blurring brush this is supposed to
distribute product evenly and buff
foundation into the skin for a selfie
ready blurring effect it has a soft
tapered dome shape that mimics the shape
of fingers to contour and blend around
the ankles of the face for a seamless
application of foundation concealer or
any other cream liquid or powder
products the ultrafine synthetic fibers
are hand cut shaped and assembled by
artisan artisans for expert
craftsmanship and the directions for
using this brush are to pump foundation
onto the back of your hand to dip brush
into products and apply in a circular
buffing motion onto the skin pray
flawless airbrushed appearance build
coverage were needed or stay as sheer as
preferred so this is what the actual
brush looks like I did use it today so
I'm sorry if it's a little stained I did
try and clean it but um I find with
foundation brushes the easiest way to
clean these is just to deep clean them
because they never really get all that
product out if you just use um like a
spray but anyway this is what it looks
like it does not actually have the name
of like brush on it like it doesn't say
selfie ready foundation blurring brush I
don't know if it was just too long of a
name or what but all it says is else but
this is what it looks like you guys can
see it has that really nice little dome
shape and these are very very soft
def
synthetic really really soft they feel
very similar to the Sigma like f80 you
know kabuki those aren't those kind of
brushes the Buki whatever blending
brushes and things like that very very
soft and nice so you guys can see that
the shape of this is actually really
interesting and it's supposed to kind of
mimic fingers like kind of tapers up
basically so when you're applying it it
kind of makes like a blurring appearance
to your skin so I am I well I'm saying
I'm wearing this today I did use this
today however I have been wearing CC
cream all week so I didn't get to try
this out with foundation this week I
have tried it out with foundation last
week and I must say I really do like
this brush I think if you use it the way
that they tell you to use it by
literally dipping you know in the
product and then using circular buffing
motions into the skin you really do get
this nice sort of like ethereal look to
the skin it really does kind of make it
look airbrushed and it's like you're
really really buffing it in and I think
that that buffing motion really kind of
makes it blend seamlessly into the skin
if that makes sense so I really do like
it for that today I did use it with my
CC cream and I actually just kind of did
like swiping motions so I picked it up
on the back of my hand and just kind of
went like this I didn't do any kind of
circular motions and I definitely didn't
like it this way I think that if you are
going to use this brush use it the way
that they you know say you should
because honestly that is the best way to
get like the most out of the brush if
that makes sense I feel like this brush
was made to be used that way so that is
my favorite way to use that the one
complaint with this particular
foundation brush from me is that it does
shed and it will leave little hairs on
your face which is super annoying
especially if you're using a liquid
foundation which by the way I have tried
this with a powder foundation as well it
is very beautiful with you know the
powder foundation the only thing that I
don't think it worked extremely well
with was probably my CC cream today but
that's because like I said I did swiping
lotions instead of actually buffing it
in like they recommend but it will leave
small little hairs on your face I don't
know if I'm just buffing too hard I
don't know what
is but um anytime I'm doing circular
motions I noticed that I have little
pieces of hair on my face which is
really annoying especially when you're
using like I said a liquid foundation
because it will just stick to the skin
you know and that it just drives me
crazy so that is the one thing I don't
like about it I also I'm kind of
disappointed that the name is not on the
brush because I mean what am I just
supposed to memorize this like any time
I'm doing a tutorial or something oh
this is my selfie ready foundation
blurring brush like I'm not going to
remember to say that so I guess I'll
just have to say it's the selfie ready
foundation brush or whatever whatever I
can remember so that's a little
disappointing that it's not on the
handle but overall I haven't had any
issues with like the ferrule or anything
I have deep cleaned this I have used it
with a spot cleaner they do recommend to
use their own deep cleanser and spot
cleaner of course and they say cleanse
regularly with the elf brush shampoo or
a daily cleanser and lay flat to dry you
can use whatever you want to clean it
but overall I think this is a really
nice foundation brush I do like it a lot
and I just want to show you guys really
quickly it is very similar the elf
ultimate blending brush this came out
not too long ago as well and I use this
to buff in foundation and it has the
same sort of texture and I do think it
gives a similar effect I think this one
actually really blurs out imperfections
a lot better than the ultimate blending
brush does but this one covers more
space so if you are in a hurry I do like
the elf ultimate blending brush better
this is six dollars as well I feel like
it's just really really quickly I can
blend anything in but I like the finish
better of this selfie blurring brush so
that is my review on this one I do think
it's nice to have for six dollars you
can't beat it so I am happy with that
and then we have the selfie powder
blurring brush which looks like this and
when I look at this the first thing I
think of is oh that looks so similar to
my expert face brush from Real
Techniques so this is my expert face
brush from Real Techniques and this is
the elf brush you can see they're quite
similar this one is a little bigger this
one is definitely more densely packed
and it's it's like thinner if that makes
sense this one's a little more chubby
but that was the first thing I thought
of but it really um it doesn't apply
foundation the same way and again it's
supposed to be a powder brush so it's
not really for foundation I think the
thought is that you use the blurring the
foundation brush and then you go in with
your powder with this but honestly this
is kind of I don't know I'm one of those
people that when I used my powder I like
to dip it in and then stipple it on my
face and this just doesn't take up
enough like room on my face if that
makes sense it's just kind of small and
I would prefer using it to contour
things like that which I did do today
but let me read a little bit about what
it says on the back of the product here
again this is six dollars it says the
selfie ready powder blurring brush this
densely packed brush shape distributes
powder evenly and buffs it into the skin
for a selfie ready effect ideal for
pressed or loose powders to create a
thin veil or buildable coverage can also
be used with any cream blush bronzer
highlighter or foundation the ultrafine
synthetic fibers are hand cut shaped and
assembled by artisans for expert
craftsmanship directions apply product
in a circular buffing motion all over
skin for a flawless airbrushed
appearance so I do prefer the blurring
brush Foundation blurring brush I do
prefer this one for foundation but this
one is pretty good it really is not as
densely packed as the expert face brush
from Real Techniques if you see you know
this online and you're thinking oh it
looks similar to that it's really not
quite like completely similar if that
makes sense but they are shaped the same
way it's just this one is a lot more
densely packed and I feel like this
really gives a beautiful finish when I
buff my foundation in on my skin this is
still nice I do prefer the other one I
prefer the either my expert face brush
or the blurring one from ELF but it's
okay for foundation what I do like to
use it for is doing the buffing
technique which I'm a huge fan of it's
after you apply all your foundation all
your powders everything you go over with
a loose powder i temped the I tend to
grab for
like HD powder silica powders things
like that and I will dip that in there
and then I lightly do the buffing
technique all over my face and that
really really makes you know your whole
face look really really seamless it
blends everything in so that there's no
harsh lines between your contour your
blush things like that and I absolutely
love it and I think this brush is
fabulous for that like I said I did use
it today to contour and I think it fits
right in that area really nicely it is a
little wide you know like if you look at
the expert face brush you can see this
one's a little smaller this one's a
little more wide so it's kind of like if
you're in a hurry it's easy to do it
with this but if you want something
really precise you could use your
expertise fresh or just use a contouring
brush but it is nice if you're just you
know bronzing up your face doing a
really light contour but mostly I like
to use this for the buffing technique so
anyway um this one oh by the way this
one does not shed at all on me and I
don't know if it's because you know I
haven't been using it with that much
like liquid products I did try it with
my CC cream I did like buffin into the
skin but I prefer the blurring
foundation brush like I said but overall
um I don't get any like loose hairs when
I use this with liquid vs. when I use
this I don't know if it's because this
one's a little more densely packed and
this one's a little more tapered I'm not
quite sure what the deal is but that's
kind of bothersome because it's like
well this is the one I'm using with
liquid and I don't want it to be
shedding but yeah I haven't noticed any
issues with that again no name on the
handle so if I'm using this in a
tutorial or I get ready with me or
something I'll just have to say this you
know this brush from Alf or whatever if
I can remember selfie powder brush but
um overall I would say I like them both
the same like I said they are both six
dollars and I think that you know a lot
of these brushes that elf has recently
come out with like the ultimate blending
and these kind of synthetic brushes are
really really nice quality and I think
that they are worth it for six dollars
definitely they're very very smooth the
only thing that I've noticed is that you
know this one leaves hairs all over my
face and that the names aren't on the
actual you know brush
just annoying because they're on this
one the ultimate blending brush it's
right there but not on these ones so not
a lot of complaints I'm pretty happy I
do like these I will continue to use
these in my routine and yeah highly
recommend checking out these new
blurring brushes or selfie ready brushes
I guess that's what I'll call them these
selfie ready brushes so the powder one
and the foundation are both are really
awesome so I hope you enjoyed this
review if you did please give it a
thumbs up and I'll see you my next one
