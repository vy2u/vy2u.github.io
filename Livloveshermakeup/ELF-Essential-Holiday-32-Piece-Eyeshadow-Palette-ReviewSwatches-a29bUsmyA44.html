i'm going to be reviewing the elf
essential holiday 32-piece i shadow
palette it looks like this and it opens
up there is no mirror but here are the
colors that you get and this runs on the
website for ten dollars under the gifts
section so basically what you get in
here are a lot of smokey tones and then
you do get some pops of color like jewel
tones that red purple blue things like
that um these are not especially creamy
they are better than some of the other
eyeshadows I have tried from ELF but
it's nothing like urban decay or to face
you know that this is not the kind of
shadow that you're getting from these um
I do have a few swatches I just did some
random ones on my arms so you can see
that the colors do pick up that's not
really an issue it's just that they're
not as easy to blend they take a little
more time and um you know I think that's
kind of what you get when you pay for a
ten-dollar palette honestly but here let
me show you those swatches a little more
close-up just kind of swatch them all
over my arm that black right there is
very nice it's a deep deep deep black
they do have I would say some of the
darker colors in here are truly truly
very dark lead and nicely pigmented like
that black color this color right here
is nice so I mean you know these are
good they're just not super silky and
soft and I think that sometimes people
especially people like me who are you
know eyeshadow palette snobs we look for
pallets that are super super creamy and
easy to work with and to blend and this
does have great pigmentation and that's
really wonderful but sometimes we want
something a little softer something
easier to work with and I think that um
this palette just doesn't really give
that and it may be because there's so
much shimmer in there there's really
only a few satin shades or matte shades
but a lot of these are filled with
glitter if you can see that close up
especially like this one up here but i
would say in general extremely pigmented
and if that's what you're looking for if
what you're looking for is pigmentation
and not smooth creamy textures then this
is awesome so again that's ten dollars
on the elf website it is under the gift
section I think that this is a limited
edition palette it is the 32 piece
holiday eyeshadow palette so I hope you
guys enjoyed this review and let me know
if you picked this up in the comments
below okay i'll see you in my next video
