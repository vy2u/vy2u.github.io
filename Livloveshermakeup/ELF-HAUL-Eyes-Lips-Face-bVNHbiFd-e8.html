thank you for joining me today i have a
haul for you guys i went on to the eyes
lips face calm website and picked up a
few things so i'm going to share with
you guys what I got so the first thing I
picked up was the ultimate blending
brush it's a new brush from the elf line
I love elf brushes I think they're
really durable they work well and
they're cheap and cheerful so I thought
I'd pick up the new ultimate blending
one or the ultimate blending brush it's
really really nice it's like a duo fiber
it's got really really nice soft
bristles and I think it'll be great for
buffing and foundation as well as powder
and you really probably could use it for
anything for blush for you know bronze
or anything like that even contouring so
I thought that that was a really good
steel and the next thing I picked up
with a blush and it's actually from
their essentials line which is there one
dollar or two dollar line and this is
the elf blush in glow it looks like this
it's a beautiful orangi peachy color and
I just thought it was really really
gorgeous and I definitely wanted to try
it out so that is what it looks like
really really pretty let me swatch it
quickly for you guys that's what it
looks like on my finger and on my hand
oh it's so beautiful that is the color
so it's really really like an iridescent
you can almost not see it but you can
definitely see it on my skin tone which
is quite pale so if you are a bit darker
you might not like it but I think it's
beautiful it just gives a really nice
flush of color add to the cheeks with a
little bit of glow alright next I picked
up a lipstick this is the eyes lips face
um Plessis lipstick 7702 in classy this
is there again from their essentials
line which is like the one to three
dollar line it used to be all one dollar
but now they are up in the prices since
they have been so popular they're upping
the prices of basically everything in my
opinion but um this is a one dollar
lipstick it says it's smooth and
long-lasting and again this isn't 7702
classy and i thought this just looked
really really beautiful on the website
some of the like swatches on the Alpha
website are kind of poor so I wasn't
exactly sure what kind of color I was
going to be getting but I think this is
gorgeous let me swatch it on the back of
my hand for you guys it's just like a
muted mauve pink and its really really
creamy and I think it will look
beautiful for summer so that is the
classy lipstick from ELF really really
pretty um and yeah like I said I heard
that they had like swatches like they do
on the colour-pop website where they
actually have like a photo of flash or
no flash with like three different
people to have different like skin tones
because the elf website I feel like
sometimes the colors I get are not what
I thought they were going to be like
they look different on the website but
that's okay this is still a beautiful
color so moving on the next thing I got
was the elf lip exfoliator I've heard so
much about this it comes in a little
tube that looks like a lipstick and I
heard so many people say good things
about this I love me a good lip scrub so
um I thought you know what I might as
well try it emilynoel83 here on YouTube
talks about it and just a lot of people
do so I thought I would go for it it was
only like three dollars and basically
the thought is that it's just this nice
little black packaging you just open it
up and it had these little like
exfoliating particles on it and you can
just rub it on your lips and go so that
is really really nice and very very
practical um the next thing I picked up
is a new products from alpha they came
out with a bronzer palette they actually
came out with a lot of pallets they had
their blush palettes that came out I
think last year and then they had um a
foundation palette that they recently
brought up with the bronzer palette and
also a contouring palette because i have
so many contouring palettes i thought i
would just go with the bronzer palettes
just because you know i am quite there
and it's nice to be a little more bronze
during the summer so this is what the
packaging looks like and the actual box
looks like this really nice and sleek
and durable big ol mirror and then you
get four shades so really really nice
they look really really good and they
look like they will complement my fair
skin tone so i am excited to try these
out and there is one shimmer one that
looks actually there's two shimmers and
two masks
I'm really really excited to try this
out next I picked up another brush this
is another new one from their line this
is the contouring brush just because you
know contouring has been all the rage
lately and of course elf had to follow
on that bandwagon so it looks really
really nice it's really sleek and it's
very very thin and dense so that's going
to be great just for kind of you know
chiseling out the cheekbones and going
underneath the chin even on the forehead
so I'm really really excited for that
it's very very soft and it's very very
dense so very excited to use that brush
the next thing I picked up was actually
a like free gift I got with purchase um
I'll always have great deals if you shop
on ebay you can even get cash back but
they were having this I mean they always
have deals but I'm their online looks
like they were having a deal where if
you spend more than like $35 you get a
free nail polish and it would appear
that you actually get to so you get the
top coat and you also get at the color
so you don't get to pick the color but
you get an elf quick dry top coat which
looks like that so that will be fun I
mean it's always good to have a top coat
to get stuff to dry quickly right so
that nothing's chipping so that's the
top coat and then the color that you get
I think is called nude oh nevermind I'm
sorry so it looks like they sent me to
quick dry top coat which is okay with me
because when I was checking out i saw
the color of a nail polish that they put
in my basket and I actually wasn't that
taking with it so I am okay a ok with
having to put dried top coats I think
they were probably out so they sent me
to instead of just one nail polish so
that is fine it was just a great little
gift um the next thing I purchased was
one of the elf studio blushes I really
love these blushes they're beautiful and
I do have quite a few one color that I
don't have that somebody here again
emilynoel83 here on YouTube recommends
really really high E is the elf studio
blush in blushing Rose it's like a
really really deep mauve kind of color
and normally I don't really go for these
sorts of blushes like this particular
tone or color but i think if i use a
light hand it will be beautiful for fall
so I'm let me swatch it quickly it's
what it looks like and it just looks
like it's going to be really really nice
for like fall and especially if you use
a light hand it's kind of like a
burgundy mauve color and it looks like
it is relatively sparkly like it has a
few small little glimmer shimmers in it
that are gold so I think that's a really
pretty color I'm excited to use it and
try it out yay yay elf I feel like you
can buy so much on the elf website for
you know so little money like you can
just continue buying things like I got
like 11 products for under fifty dollars
but so yeah anyway the next thing I got
was another elf studio make up a mist
and set I've been using this for years
this is a very good makeup setting spray
it is three dollars so it is a lot
cheaper than say the Urban Decay ones or
even the one that L'Oreal recently came
out with their infallible one which
costs like sixteen dollars if you're in
if you're new and into trying out a
makeup setting spray definitely try out
the elf one so to see if you like the
feel of it this one has a low pretty
cucumbers vitamins a c and e in it i
don't know if it have all that in it but
it does make my makeup last and i have a
nice little spritz bottle and it's easy
to travel with so picked up another one
of those i've been using that particular
product for probably four or five years
now the next thing i got was another
blush from the studio line which again
is the cheaper or not these a studio
line i'm sorry the essential line the
studio line is they're more expensive
line in their work sense of products in
their line and the essentials line is
the cheaper one so this blush i think
was two dollars whereas the studio ones
are like three to five dollars i believe
so this blush is in the color flushed
and i just thought it was really really
beautiful again probably going to be
really really nice for the fall and i
just thought it was really pretty and i
find that the essential blushes are a
lot creamier and smooth
than the studio ones so if you are a
sucker for a nice smooth blush
definitely check out the essentials line
so there again you can see the swatch
it's really really glowy kind of like
the other one which was called hello so
I have the PT 1 and I have this
beautiful one I think that's just a
gorgeous color for all the time doesn't
matter what season it is that looks
beautiful probably all the time and I
think you'll give a lot of nice color
and glow to my skin um and let's see
here this the last thing now I have a
few more things I got another brush
again this is one of their new mirages
this is the blending brush it looks like
this and it says it creates a flawless
look that's beautiful and natural
looking so it's really cute it's kind of
smaller and it's kind of like a fan
brush shaped like a fan brush it's not
as dentists say the contouring brush or
the other one which was what like the
powder buffing brush or whatever but it
seems like it would be nice for just
sweeping on maybe a highlight that isn't
super pigmented or even just lightening
up certain areas on the face you could
even probably contour with this if you
wanted to very very lightly because it
probably won't pick up that much product
because it is so fluffy so anyway I'm
excited to try it it's really really
soft and ya can't go wrong it's like a
five or six dollar brush and the last
thing I picked up the last thing right I
have to keep checking sorry every time I
pulled the white box up it changes the
color of my skin makes me look nice and
tan like this however that's not how I
actually look unfortunately this is it
yes I should just hold a white box and
back of me all the time right guys
thanks the last thing i got is also new
to the elf line it is the got a glow lip
tint in perfect pink I think I heard
emilynoel83 again I'm so obsessed with
her I will link her channel below you
guys she does not need any more
subscribers or she does I mean of course
she should have more subscribers I just
mean she doesn't need me to be
recommending her channel she's not a
small channel she's a big channel but
she's amazing and I really pick up a lot
of things that she recommends but she
said that this is comparable to like a
Lancome Lipton or something like that
and I think it comes with beautiful
little packaging and almost looks like
it's blast and it says elf perfect pink
and is supposed to be like a gloss
not a glass a bomb a glow lip tint but
supposed to give like a beautiful color
I'm not writing anything on my lips
right now so let's pop it on nice so it
really really is smooth it's not
something that's going to get stuck like
on your teeth or anything you can see it
looks like it's almost like not even a
color it looks like it's almost wiped
but it leaves a beautiful beautiful nice
light pink tint on the lips so I like
products like that the kind of take on
to your own lip color and they give you
with something that looks very natural
so I think it's very very pretty and I
like it so far so anyway that was my
alcohol I hope you guys enjoyed this if
you did please give this video a thumbs
up and I'll see in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
