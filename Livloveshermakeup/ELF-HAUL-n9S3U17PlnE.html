my channel happy Tuesday today's video
is going to be an alcohol so I would say
about a month ago I did at placed an
order on the elf calm website for a
bunch of their skincare items and ever
since then I have really really really
wanted to try out more of their products
so I did pick up some brushes some
sponges and also makeup so let's go
ahead and jump right into it I have
already swatched a few of these items
out I'll let you know what my first
impressions are from the swatches
haven't tried them out on my face yet
but I will do a follow up haul for you
guys once we are settled into the new
apartment so anyway the first item I
have here is the elf a beautifully
precise precision sponge trio this is
what it looks like you get three
different sponges in different sizes you
get a little tiny little micro mini
which I'm totally not into these really
really tiny tiny sponges I feel like
they're very hard to work with and I
always end up dropping them but then you
do get a medium sized sponge and then a
large sponge so this one right here the
medium size really intrigues me I feel
like this is going to be perfect
underneath the eye area I will say all
these do you feel a little more dense
that I normally would like but that's
okay we shall see how they work once
they are damp here is what the mini one
looks like if you are curious and then
here is what the large one looks like so
we'll see how these go I really don't
like that they're white because I feel
like they're gonna stay in super easy
but I will keep you guys updated all
right the next item i picked up is the
beautifully bare and natural glow of
face palette I've wanted this forever I
heard that it is a dupe for some sort of
a cosmetics palette I love elf cosmetics
face palettes I love the blush palettes
I love the illuminating palettes the
bronzer palette and this one looks
amazing so the packaging is super pretty
it's like a gorgeous mirrored effect and
then you open it up and this is what it
looks like on the inside so I feel like
the actual shades in here really like
the camera is doing it no justice they
look very very pretty and light kind of
like a nice flush of peach and then you
have a little bit of a like Melba sort
of color reminds me of the Melba blush
from Mac then you have more of like a I
don't know like highlighting shade over
here that kinda reminds me of like dim
light from hourglass and then a little
bit of a bronzer they feel super super
silky and beautiful so I'm so excited to
try these out I don't know if you guys
can see those swatches but very very
excited to try that particular palette
out and
cause I do love those pallets so much I
also did pick up the contour palette so
I feel like I have every single face
palette from ELF now but I just love the
formula I think they're really really
nicely priced and they are good quality
so here is what the contouring palette
looks like and on the inside that is
what it looks like so here we have like
a nice kind of bronzer shade I feel like
that's going to be great on my fair
complected skin we have a little bit of
a highlighting shade here a yellow tone
powder and then a true contour over
there so very very excited for these let
me do a little bit of swatching oh my
gosh yeah they are so soft you guys so
buttery all right here are a few so
watches hopefully you guys can see that
look really really nice that's a
beautiful cool tone color alright moving
on I did also pick up this elf sculpting
a silk eyeshadow trio
I have already swatched this out two of
the shades are so incredibly buttery but
unfortunately the purple shading here is
a little on the weak side or a little
crispy to the touch this is in a rosy
all day these are new little sculpting
eyeshadow trios but these two shades
right here this one which is like a true
transition which is matte and this one
which is a shimmer in the middle are so
soft you guys like so incredibly soft I
can't even believe it um let me go ahead
and swatch those and then unfortunately
this kind of purpley shade here is a
little more on the crispy side but it's
very very pigmented so there they are
obviously these pair together really
really nicely I normally don't reach for
duos or trios all that often but I felt
like for our trip like when we're
traveling in the car for like a good
three or four days that might be nice to
have around and also it would be really
really nice just to toss like in your
purse every single day so I did get that
let's see here I also picked up the elf
highlighting brush so I've heard that
this is like a dupe afford the Sigma
f-35 tapered highlighting brush and then
also it looks very similar to the lux II
highlighting brush so here is what it
looks like it seems like it's a little
longer but it is quite soft I do like
elf brushes for the most part and this
is actually very very densely packed so
it's probably going to put highlight on
it really really nicely but yeah that is
the elf highlighting brush as usual I
had to pick up some of my all-time
favorite powders I love the elf tone
correcting powders and cool so I did go
ahead and pick up two more of those and
then something that looked a little
similar or like these
it feels like a dupe for like the
meteorite pearls or whatever Tara babes
here on YouTube talks about those all
the time this is the elf mineral pearls
in the skin a balancing version so the
elf tone correcting powders have four
different like quadrants right here so
they have different colors this looks
similar but in like meteorite form I
guess you could say so I'm very excited
to see this let's go ahead and open it
up so you have this nice little acrylic
packaging right here I felt like I was
going to get more in here but that's
okay all right you do have a little pouf
at the top which is awesome and then you
have the little pearls in the bag I'm
not going to open this yet until we
actually move but you empty them in
there and it does look like they have a
little bit of a sheen so maybe that's
something that's nice just to touch up
throughout the day with so we shall see
about those I also did pick up this elf
what is this brow pencil in the shade
taupe so they had a bunch of different
brow products on the actual website but
I remember my friend Rochelle talking
about how much she loves the Auburn
shade so I did go ahead and get taupe
since that's what's going to match me
she has red hair
I don't but yeah it says slim mechanical
pencil shapes defines and fills in the
brows you have a spoolie on one side and
then from what I remember her saying
this has a little more of like a wet
formula to it and I've been really into
that lately when it comes to my brow
pencils because the Revlon Colorstay
brow pencil on blonde is kind of like
that so that is what this swatch looks
like it looks really nice and precise
and I love that you have the spoolie on
the other end so I'm super excited about
this I believe this was in the
one-dollar category or one dollar area
on the actual website so I will keep you
guys updated on that and then I did pick
up the elf daily brush cleaner so I have
tried this one before I think this is
the is just a spray one let me see here
yeah so this is basically just like a
quick touch-up for brushes if you don't
want to deep clean them you just bring
it onto an actual paper towel and then
rub your brush in there I don't remember
leaving my bristles to oily but I do
remember going through this quite
quickly but I thought I would try it
again just because I hate deep cleaning
my brushes but it is important to spot
clean so I did pick that up and then I
also got this elf Pro eyeshadow primer
so I have not tried this one before I
have tried the one dollar version as
well as the glitter glue
I love
both of those eye primers so I thought
this one would be nice it looks like it
comes in a squeezy bottle yeah it comes
in a squeezy bottle I feel like that
white packaging is going to get dirty
quite quickly but very very excited to
try that out I feel like you can get
really really good eye primers at the
drugstore no need to spend more than
1015 dollars on an eye primer and then
finally the last item I picked up is the
tinted lip oil and berry kiss I wanted
to get all of the shades but I think
like three or four of them were sold out
on the actual website but you guys know
I love lip oil so it says this
conditioning lip oil softly tends to the
lips with a wash of color and it's huge
this packaging is absolutely huge let's
see what the little doe foot applicator
looks like oh ah ah
Oh mmm okay that didn't go out on as
nicely as I would have thought mmm
kind of tastes a little on the sour side
but that is okay the actual doe foot is
very interesting it has like a little
dip in it so it's really easy to get
onto the lips
smells super super sweet and yeah I'm
excited to try this out I love anything
that has to do with like lip oils or
moisturizing lip product so anyway guys
that is my alcohol I hope you enjoyed
this video like I said I will have a
follow up haul soon for you guys and
yeah that's pretty much it I'll see you
guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
