tonight I have an alcohol for you guys I
went into the eyes lips face calm
website and purchased a few things some
of them are all favorites some are
hopefully going to be new favorites
things that I have not purchased yet
before so let's just get started if you
see me reach behind me it's because it's
where I'm keeping all the stuff so let's
talk about the first things I got I got
three pairs of eyelashes from alpha I
have never tried their eyelashes before
so I thought I would just go ahead and
give it a shot the first one is the
natural lash collection and it includes
two eyelash sets one adhesive glue a one
tweezer so excited to try those the
second one I got is also the everyday
last collection which includes two
eyelash sets one adhesive glue and one
tweeter I like that you get everything
in these little kits I believe these
were only three dollars and then this
one was one dollar this is the natural
lash kit and it includes one pair of
lashes one eyelash glue but what I mean
is it's nice you don't have to buy like
the glue separately and they give you
tweezers that's pretty awesome so I also
got three nail polishes from their
website i saw that they were having kind
of like um how she say this holiday nail
polish is out so i got very excited lots
of glitter so the first one I got is in
chic confetti and it looks like this
gorgeous the second one I got is in love
me and it looks like this the third one
and last one I got is in see escape and
this is a really really dark navy blue
almost black ish so love that next I got
two of the tone correcting powder is if
you watch my channel you know that I
love the tone correcting powder and cool
I set my foundation with that almost
every single day but I went on the
website and I saw that they do have one
inch shimmer and also one in warm so I
thought I'd try both this is the shimmer
one and this is the warm one if they are
the same formula as the cool one I know
I'm going to love them so let's see
about those the next thing I got are
some
brushes will show them all at once i
guess i got the blending i brush the eye
crease brush their new crease brush from
the studio line which looks nice smudge
i brush or sponge and one of their
studio blush brushes which i love i have
a few of these but I needed more what
can I say the next thing I got was a
cream eyeliner I have a few of these I
really love the formula this one is in
midnight yes midnight and it's just this
really really dark navy blue almost
black color and I heard that navy blue
is really nice for brightening up the
eyes especially the whites of your eyes
so I thought I'd try that out especially
with finals coming up be stressful and I
don't want to look horrible so the next
thing I got was a smudge pot I have a
few of these I love these I think
they're comparable to the color tattoos
I got a new color this has got a glow
that's a nice Goldie color kind of
reminds me it reminds me of the eternal
sunshine is that also from l'oreal it's
like those pressed pigment I like those
so mine's me in that color the next
thing I got was an elf long-lasting
lustrous I shadow I love this formula
also i have a few other of these this is
in the color confetti they're kind of
like moosie but they really stay all day
and I really appreciate that the next
thing I got was the elf waterproof
shadow liner and this is in the color
taupe it looks like that really nice i
think this is a newer product for them
so we'll see how that goes on the next
thing I got oh this actually came in a
little like three kits so I saw this and
I immediately wanted it it's this little
eye shadow palette this is also in there
like gifts section or whatever um this
really reminds me of my naked palette my
naked one palette and I just was like
what does that remind me of oh yes my
naked palette so want to try this out
in a little set of three so you get that
eye shadow palette then you get a
lengthening and defining mascara which
looks like it actually has a nice wand
it's pretty small so hopefully they'll
be good for the bottom lashes let's hope
the formula is good because a lot of the
mascaras I've tried out from alpha I
actually don't like so we'll see about
that one and the last thing that comes
in the little kit is a brightening
eyeliner pencil and that's just in black
so good to have the next thing I got was
an elf lip stain in the color of
birthday suit so you get the gloss on
this side and then you get the color on
this side and that's a beautiful pink
isn't it I think so next I got three of
these little lip balms they're called
soothing lip balms these were in the
little gift section 2 for the holidays
and they are not like tinted lip balms
they're just regular lip balms but they
had these cute little pastel colors that
I thought were adorable and I just want
to try these out and I think they'd be
nice to throw my purse apply before I
put on some kind of drying lipstick or
whatever those would just be nice and
hang on there the next thing I got was
one of the elf pressed mineral eye
shadows I didn't want to get too many of
these because I was worried that maybe I
wouldn't like the formula but honestly
I'm angry now that I didn't get more
because i swatched this and it feels
like butter this is in the color what's
your name is this beautiful taupe color
I'm definitely going to go back on the
website in order more of these because I
love the consistency and the last thing
I galactic was this 32-piece eyes lips
face eyeshadow palette and this was also
in the holiday section i believe it was
like 9 95 or something and these are the
colors you get I think they are
beautiful they have lots of jewel tones
in here um they're pretty creamy and
soft I'm not quite sure about color
payoff yet but i think i'm going to do a
tutorial with them we'll see how it goes
so that was my alcohol i hope you guys
