channel today's video is going to be a
review on six of different elf skin care
items I purchase all of these on the elf
skin care comm website or just the elf
com website so I'll go ahead and link
that down below if you would like to
check it out it is not an affiliate link
it will just take you directly to the
website but yeah let me know down below
if you want me to try out their new skin
care line apparently they're releasing
like a new one in a couple of weeks so I
would be more than happy to try some of
those items out recently it has been
requested that I try out some more
affordable skincare so I also did place
an order on the ordinary calm for some
of their skin care items so expect to
see that review soon but yeah basically
I picked up six different items of all
sorts of different like natures I guess
you could say so let me tell you what
quickly what I picked up so all of these
products all together did cost me $57
there was no tax and shipping was free
the hydrating bubble mask was the most
expensive out of all of them at a
whopping of $14 which may sound kind of
crazy but you do get 50 grams or 1.69
ounces of product in here now I do think
that it's still pretty darn good the
packaging is amazing on these products
for the ten to fourteen dollar range I'm
really really surprised at the amount of
packaging and the work that they put
into that I think it's just beautiful so
yeah the hydrating bubble mask did cost
me $14 next we do have the oil to foam
cleanser this was ten dollars but again
you do get five fluid ounce of product
in here so I do think it's worth it next
we do have the hydrating water sheet
mask this was three dollars and I'm kind
of in love with the sheet mask which is
crazy because I feel like normally sheet
masks all do the same sort of thing but
I really do like this so far and then we
have the hydrating water essence which
is my favorite out of the bunch
again you get five fluid ounces a
product in here for ten dollars next we
do have the illuminating eye cream which
does cost $10 as well and then finally
the hydrating gel melt cleanser which is
also $10 so let me tell you guys the
products that I'm really really in love
with the first one I want to talk about
is the hydrating water essence I would
absolutely recommend this to anybody I
feel like the only skin type that this
might not work for is if you do have
sensitive skin the reason why I say that
is because it has quite a strong oh i'm
tasting it it has quite a strong
fragrance to it now the fragrance is
kind of like a fruity sort of fragrance
kind of like mango or something like
that but it is a really really beautiful
hydrating essence now how I personally
like to
essence is I go in with my regular toner
then I'll go in with an essence because
it's kind of like a liquidy lotion I
sort of toner then I go in with my serum
then I go in with my day cream or night
cream and then I'll go in with my facial
setting spray or whatever now a lot of
people do actually use this if you do
have like more oily skin a lot of people
like to use this as their actual
moisturizer currently Tom is using a
hydrating water essence as an actual
moisturizer so that's definitely
something you can do as well but if you
do have more a normal skin at dry skin
or even combo skin I would highly
recommend using this after your toner so
it does say on the back here a
lightweight water-based lotion that
hydrates for healthy glowing looking
skin this light watery texture glides
onto the skin to hydrate leave skin
feeling refreshed and smooth and it is
infused with purified water coconut
water and LG so maybe that is the sense
that I'm detecting in here a little bit
of coconut but it really is a beautiful
you guys so this is something I'm
incredibly impressed with and I feel
like five fluid ounces for ten dollars
is a very very good deal so this is
definitely something I am going to pick
up again and again recently I did try
out the Hungarian water essence from
belief and I really wasn't that like
into it I mean I thought it was good but
like compared to this this is much much
better so if you are looking into a
water essence and you want to try one
out would HIGHLY highly recommend this
will repurchase alright next we do have
the elf hydrating gel melt cleanser
again it comes in this beautiful
beautiful packaging you open it up and
this is what it looks like on the inside
so this is kind of like a cleansing balm
to remove your makeup so as you guys can
actually see it literally is like an oil
it's like a gel oil and it feels very
very strange it kind of feels almost
like you're rubbing like plastic on your
face or like melted plastic I know that
sounds very very strange but this one
does not have any sort of fragrance to
it now I feel like it removes my makeup
absolutely beautifully but this is the
fourth time that I have used it last
night was the fourth time and you guys
can see I have almost hit the bottom of
the container here so for $10 this is
just not worth it for me I would really
really recommend you guys go for the
nourishing oil to foam if you want
something that will remove your makeup
and you can have something that's like a
bang for your buck I would definitely
recommend going for the nourishing oil
to foam this does remove makeup like I
said if you want to specifically use it
for eye makeup I think that would be a
great idea it doesn't sting my eye area
it removes makeup completely but
unfortunately I just feel like I'm going
through it very very quickly so nothing
this product I just wouldn't repurchase
again maybe I would if I wanted to just
remove eye makeup but for my whole
entire face I feel like I'm going
through it too quickly now if you do
have more combo to oily skin I think you
would love this because it rinses
completely clean there is no residue
there is no tacky oily whatever kind of
residue whatsoever so I really do like
that just don't really think it's worth
the price and now here we have the
nourishing oil to foam cleanser so this
does the same exact thing but it's more
in a liquid form you do get five fluid
ounces of product in here and this is
ten dollars I think this one's really
really good you guys it does have a
little bit of a plasticy sort of scent
to it but it removes all of my eye
makeup all of my face makeup so so so
beautifully and I just really really
love like oil cleansers so this is
something I will repurchase over and
over if there are two products that I
would recommend hands-down out of this
whole entire video it is these guys
right here really really good so yeah
really loving that nourishing oil to
foam a cleanser next we do have the
illuminating eye cream so I don't feel
like this does a whole lot this actually
reminds me a lot of the Smashbox under
eye photo Hydra what is it called it was
called these Smashbox under eye primer
that's what it was called so basically
you get a huge amount of product in here
this is what the packaging looks like
you are getting a total of it doesn't
actually say here but you're getting a
whole lot of eye cream here as you guys
can see this is like the size that you
would normally see for an actual face
cream so a lot of eye cream in here and
it feels very cooling to the touch it's
got a nice consistency very very buoyant
very light I think if you do have dry
skin or a dry under eye area very mature
skin this is not going to give you
enough hydration but if you do have like
combo to oily skin you're a little on
the younger side maybe like 18 and
you're just getting into like anti-aging
skincare I think this is a nice product
for you to try I actually don't think
it's hydrating enough for me and I'm
gonna be 25 pretty darn soon I do have
combo skin but unfortunately like I said
I just feel like this doesn't give me
enough hydration underneath the eye
however if you want to go in with an eye
cream and then go in with this and kind
of use it as your under-eye hydrating
primer I think it would work it really
does kind of smooth out the under eye
leaves a little bit of a sheen but I
really don't notice that much of a
difference with this so this is not
something I would recommend to you guys
unless you are very young maybe 16 17 18
years old you don't have a lot of fine
lines and wrinkles you don't
a lot of dryness under your eyes you
just want to have something so that you
can start with helping with the
anti-aging properties or with the
anti-aging kind of thing because
obviously when you're putting moisture
under there you are less likely to be
getting creasing and lines underneath
your eyes so if you want to try this as
like a starter for skin care I think
that's nice but I just don't think it's
something that I'm going to be
purchasing again I'm really not that
interested so that was something that I
wasn't totally in love with now this guy
right here the hydrating water sheet
mask with purified water and aloe I
really like this now what's funny is
that I'm not usually someone who was
like in love with sheet masks I feel
like they really just do the same thing
over and over and over again but this
one smelled like a Veda haircare product
and it really really was saturated with
product now I will say my biggest
complaint with sheet mass is the fact
that a lot of the times I don't feel
like they actually fit my face I will
say this one did kind of fall off my
face but if you can just scoop up the
essence at the bottom and then just like
slather it on your face and just leave
it on you will notice this makes like
the best primer ever so if you want to
use one of these in the morning or you
want to use one before going on stage if
you have a show if you have a special
event this is a great way to kind of get
your face started and get it going it's
not something I would use at nighttime
just because I felt like the benefits
were so instant and beautiful I had
really nice glowing smooth looking skin
it's definitely something I would want
to use before going out but this is
something I would repurchase I really
really like this I would say it's very
comparable to some of those Sephora
sheet masks um if you've ever tried
those out those are not cruelty free
this one is so yeah really enjoyed that
would repurchase and then finally we do
have the hydrating bubble mask like I
said this was just something that made
me a break out it is not something that
I personally like for my skin it does
come out like this you just press down
you can see the gel comes out and then
the bubbles start to foam on the face I
just feel like for me personally it was
a little too much it just kind of
irritated my t-zone area irritated my
nose area it also didn't really suck out
the oil out of my skin I felt like it
did leave my skin feeling slightly
balanced but it's really only something
I would use in the morning before going
in with like my makeup just so that it
kind of wakes me up in the morning it
does tickle quite a bit so if you are
ticklish around your mouth there
around your nose area this is going to
tickle your face and you will be
giggling oh it's giggling the other
night Soph was like what are you
laughing about I'm like this mess it's
making me ticklish um but overall I
don't feel like you're really deep
cleanses my pores I don't feel like it
left my skin glowing I don't felt it
feel like it left my skin with like a
healthy looking glow I don't feel like
it did any of that I don't feel like it
removed excess dirt it really didn't do
much but it did feel cool and I can see
why this is a very hyped up product is
because it's a different sort of
experience from masking but it's
something that just did not work for my
skin so the ones that I would definitely
repurchase you guys are the hydrating
water essence I would definitely
repurchase the nourishing oil to foam
cleanser and I would definitely
repurchase the hydrating water a sheet
mask the three that I would not
repurchase are the illuminating eye
cream didn't feel like it did much I
would not repurchase the bubble mask
again didn't feel like it did much and
then I would not repurchase the
hydrating gel melt cleanser just because
I feel like I would run through this way
too quickly if I were to use this for
one week like consistently removing my
makeup at nighttime I feel like I would
go through one of these a week which is
not worth it so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video thank you so much for joining
me and I will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
