I have a review and swatches for you
guys on the elf sunset prism eyeshadow
palette it looks like this there are two
of these I like two different colors
sets this one is in sunset so it's more
pink based but there is also a neutral
one I could not find it at the target I
was at by the way I did get this at
Target it was $10 but like I said I
could not find it at the target I was at
so I will because they do like this
palette I will go ahead and pick up the
neutral one when I can find it but this
was the only one I could find he gets
six gorgeous gorgeous I would say very
pink toned shades highly highly shimmery
almost metallic
on the verge of being metallic I am
wearing it on my eyes today I would say
the only big issue I have with this is
that I find that some of the colors tend
to be too close to each other when it
comes to swatches and also on the actual
lid I think that this color right here
in that color tend to just look too
similar on the eye and also in swatches
but as you can see from these swatches
you really get a nice variety of pink
warm based colors and I think they're
beautiful you get a nice gold you get
that beautiful purple at the bottom I
wish that was a little more purpley
almost because in the palette it looks
like it will be but on your eye and also
in swatches it doesn't quite come out
that color it's almost very similar to
the one above it but this one's a little
more Bob toned but like I was saying you
get just a nice variety of shades here
you get a nice highlight up here these
are super super buttery easy to blend
easy to work with and I really love them
um you do get a dual sided um what is it
sponge applicator that it comes with in
the tray I took that out just because I
didn't use those very often I didn't
think I would so that's the only thing I
took out of here but um that is what the
palette looks like and I highly
recommend it I'm definitely gonna pick
up the neutral one I think that it
really swatches beautifully and it is
gorgeous on the eyes you know the color
of the Year Pantone color of the year is
marsala which is this really gorgeous um
like midtone pink with like mauve in it
and I think that these shadows really
embody that kind of color so I hope
you guys enjoyed this review and let me
know if you have picked this up let me
know if you like the neutral I want I
really look forward to picking that up
because I do you love working with these
like I said this was ten dollars at
Target I think that's a good price range
for a palette like this I know that elf
has gone up in price the past couple of
years but honestly they're starting to
become a lot more well-known and also um
their shadow the qualities of just their
makeup in general are really getting up
there so I think the price is right and
I'm really really happy with this so I
hope you guys enjoyed this review I'll
see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
