empties for the month of April this is
the last video I'm filming today I
promise um so anyway it is April
thirtieth which means i have to show you
guys all the products i use that this
month and I'm really excited I love
doing empties videos I'm not quite sure
what it is a lot of pictures to thought
that like I went through all these
products makes me feel good so anyway
let's get started I went through a thing
of the studio 35 cotton swabs these are
just otherwise known as q-tips these are
great very basic whatever I also went
through the CVS Pharmacy premium cotton
squares I really like using these my
boyfriend recommended i use these
instead of cotton swabs for i mean
instead of cotton balls for applying
toner and also for using like micellar
water or cleansing solutions and it
really really works well it doesn't soak
up all the formula into the cotton ball
um cotton balls soaked up all the
formulas what I mean these ones do not
back from squares so I really really
like those I used up a bath and
Bodyworks vanilla berry sorbet deep
cleansing hand soap this smelled really
really good it's one of my favorites I
used up the makeup remover cleansing
towelettes refill pack from Neutrogena
they says ultra soft cloths patented
formula to solve all traces of makeup
even waterproof mascara I really like
these these were really really nice they
do leave a bit of a residue on the skin
however they are really really soft and
pillowy the actual sheets are so really
really gentle on the skin I like that a
lot I used up a tony moly lemon facemask
facemask sheet mask brightening so this
is a lemon-infused mask where a more
radiant skin really really cute
packaging and I liked it a lot it felt
good i really like sheet masks so
definitely like that I've used up some
of the pampers baby fresh wipes I use
these two used on my hands after when
I'm applying makeup during makeup
application after and also when I'm
doing swatches for you guys and videos
to remove makeup really like they be
smelled like a little baby but then they
smell really good they just smell like
baby wipes
I've used up another package of baby
wipes this one is in my favorite set
this is like the best baby wipes I ever
found I used to really like just the
Pampers ones however these are my
favorite out these are the Huggies one
and done cucumber and green tea this
scent is so good like it smelled amazing
so I actually have a full pack right now
that I'm going through also but I
absolutely love the scent of these it's
just so fresh and I smells so much
better doesn't smell like a baby wipe it
smells like yumminess anyway they also
have frozen on the front chat hola fair
he's so cute and I used up the Shea
Moisture argan oil and brush a hand and
body scrub with frankincense and myrrh
extract it says its anti-aging and
softening and I really liked this um
it's one of those things where I really
like good smelling products in the
shower this was not one of those
products however I did notice that my
skin look better after using it then
most of the other body scrubs I've used
that just smell good in the shower so
it's like either you have a really great
shower experience or you have something
that really really does do well for your
skin I can't decide which one is better
um i would definitely repurchase this
and also frankincense and myrrh extract
are very very good anti-aging properties
they're just they're anti in florham
anti-inflammatory they help calm he'll
everybody lies doll looking skin and it
has argan oil shea butter tons of really
really good stuff in here so I
definitely would repurchase I did pick
up i think the super fruit 1 i'll lately
so was it yeah i think a couple of weeks
ago i haven't gotten to it yet because
i'm using one from death and body works
right now the basil and eucalyptus which
is also great but this one really did i
noticed a difference with shane waste
your products especially the scrub i did
notice the difference in my skin like it
it didn't just feel good it looked good
so like that a lot I've used up the
boots botanics the power of plants
micellar cleansing solution three and
one albright dissolves makeup unclogs
pores and removes impurities in one easy
step for all skin with brightening
hibiscus I loved this I've gotten really
into my seller waters i like to use them
after waking up in the morning to take
off at any residue that i have left for
I make up from the night before and also
i like to use them after cleansing my
face at night um sometimes I have
leftover makeup and I like to use that
also if I'm in a hurry like I know every
single friday i have to be somewhere
really early um so i use micellar water
instead of cleansing my face at the sink
or going into the shower um excuse me i
use a micellar water and i find that
it's really good right now i am using
the one from simple and then after that
i got a big container of the sapporo one
so I've quite a few to try out but I do
like this book boots botanics one and I
definitely would repurchase um next I
used up the suave professionals revived
and refreshed dry shampoo I did not
really like this um the scent kind of
nauseated me and on top of that um it
really really made my hair feel textured
which is good when I'm wearing my hair
up however when I'm wearing my hair down
I don't like it to feel like that so I
would not repurchase this dry shampoo um
I used up another bath and body works
deep cleansing handsome this one was in
black cheering Merlot this is one of my
favorite favorite fragrances during the
wintertime I think this was the last
winter so by you stop so that's good
because now we're getting into May and I
don't want all those heavy deep
fragrances I want something nice and
light so this is a great great sense
though it really smells just like black
cherries and wine really really yummy so
love that I used up the Sephora Rose eye
mask it's ultra moisturizing and
brightening i loved it i would
definitely repurchase my mom used up my
mom is actually visiting me on she used
the other day the doctor jar to
brightening infusion hydro gel mask it's
for dark circles they'll miss dark spots
and uneven a skin tone and it's so cute
she actually wrote up here this was good
uh-huh so she did like this um she said
it made her skin feel really really nice
and soft um but she wasn't completely
like blown away by it but she did like
that the next thing I used up was the
herbal essences no fading away
conditioning treatment it looks like
this it smells like roses it was amazing
i would definitely repurchase it didn't
condition like it
make my hair super soft however it did
seal in it seals in the color and also
it just smells really really good so I
really liked that I would repurchase
I've used up a soft soap pomegranate and
mango hand soap and I when I was
traveling a couple of months ago when I
was probably a couple months ago got a
small size of this in the body wash and
I loved the scent and the fragrance so
when I saw that they had it in a hand
soap I have to get it really really
liked it it's definitely on Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works kind of level when it comes to
fragrance so really really good I've
used up the Neutrogena makeup remover
cleansing towelettes in the hydrating
version it says it cleanse and removes
makeup even waterproof mascara and
conditions and soothes the skin in one
simple step I really liked these they
smelled really good and again they're
really really nice and soft and pillowy
I love the texture of the Neutrogena
makeup remover wipes I used up the
boscia charcoal pore minimizing hydro
gel mask I liked this a lot it was
interesting i'm really into these hydro
gel mask now they're kind of like the
new thing after sheet masks however I
did notice that the bottom half of it
kept falling off and I actually do want
to mention too that when my mom used the
dr jart one this hydro gel mouth she had
the same issue it's like it comes with
two different pieces the top half stays
on but the bottom half does not and it
did not stay on for me when I use the
bow show one and it did not stay on for
her when she use the dr jart one so i
don't know if that's just like you know
our faces or if that happens to a lot of
people but that was you know enough to
make me not want to purchase it again i
used up two packs of the BAM total
refresh cooling body cloths I love these
four after i workout and also just when
um like it's a hot day outside and I
come in and I just want to like wipe
myself down they have a nice like
powdery finish to them they don't make
you know they've wipe up sweat nicely
and they just make you feel nice and
cool all over so these are great for the
spring and summertime these are two
different scents they were both nice i
think i prefer the purple and pink one
over the blue one go
I used up the elf makeup remover
cleansing cloths these were amazing I
really like them there were 20 in here
and these were so moist like they really
held in a lot of moisture they retained
a lot of moisture I love that I always
find that cloth don't have enough
moisture in them so I really love these
and I definitely would repurchase I used
up a pack of the chick intuition
revitalizing moisture cartridges for my
razor this was in tropical citrus these
were really nice I really love this
chick intuition is basically just a
built-in shower like it so basically
it's like a built-in shave cream to your
razor so you don't have to actually use
shaving cream so love that we definitely
your purchase I used up these two for a
pomegranate I mask which is anti fatigue
and energizing also loved that would
repurchase the wet and wild under the
sheets 25 makeup remover towelettes use
these I would not repurchase they were
just not moist enough however they did
smell very good I used up the Sephora
Lotus eye mask which is moisturizing and
soothing really liked it but we're
purchase and also the pearl I'm mask
which is perfecting and brightening also
really like that one would definitely
repurchase I used up the secret scent
expressions so very summer very clear
gel deodorant I love the smell it's not
really good however it did leave white
marks even though it says it does not
leave white max it did so I have since
moved on to the new spray deodorant and
those really truly don't leave any white
rag so I won't be repurchasing this um I
used up a bath and body works pop pocket
back um antibacterial hand gel like a
hand sanitizer this was a wild mango
mojito this was kind of an overpowering
fragrance I don't know and I really can
take a lot of fragrance without it
feeling like it's overpowering but this
one was just a little on the
overpowering side I don't think I would
repurchase that particular scent you
step up a lint roller so I put that in
there but obviously it was important to
me because you know lint rollers really
help you
cats especially I have a cute little cat
behind there napping right now um we of
cats it's really really important tool
enroll yourself before you walk out the
door always I used up an elf tone
correcting powder and cool my go-to
powder we love it I used up a bath and
bodyworks cinnamon sugar donut three
wick candle loved it smell just like a
donut it was amazing i also used up a
glade candle i think this was called
like mid summer or something not
midsummer night's dream but midsummer
something smelled really good really
nice and fresh kind of like a perfume or
cologne my mom used up the belief
believe in truth the true Prima aqua
bomb and she used this the other day and
she absolutely loved it you can see she
wrote here Wow um and we actually ended
up going to support yesterday and
purchasing her a full size of this she
really loved it she could ended up
getting the gel formula instead of the
cream one and she really really liked it
so anyway um she really was into that um
I used up a bath and body works through
the candle and marshmallow fireside the
smells exactly like a marshmallow
fireside seriously so good smells like a
bonfire is just so good but anyway use
that up it was great I really love that
bath and Bodyworks candles burn all the
way even to the bottom there's nothing
worse than a candle that doesn't burn
evenly to the bottom it looks ugly I
used up a wallflower put it in here so
the oil would spill up still out used up
another glade candle this one was like
an apple cinnamon and I think vanilla
custard mix so I had like apple cinnamon
and the vanilla custard at the bottom
smelled amazing I might be hot that and
keep the little container I used up it's
a 10 miracle d conditioner plus plus
keratin I really really liked this it
smelled really good and it really did
make my hair feel nice and soft and
moisturized I used up the dr brandt
needles no more instant wrinkle relaxing
I like this a lot it seemed to work
really really well the first couple of
days I used it and then not so well
after but I would purchase and I would
try out again however is very expensive
so we'll have to see about that one I
used up the bath and body works
aromatherapy stress relief vanilla
bourbon about soap it says relax and
unwind vanilla essential oil has a
soothing effect on body and mind I love
these I love the aroma therapy line from
Bath and Body Works and this is no
exception this was great it's like those
little crystal beads that you pop into
the bath they don't make any bubbles or
anything but they really make a nice
like just it smells really good and you
just soak in it feels really good so use
that up i also used up a lush bubble gum
lip scrub this is one of my favorite lip
scrubs i love the bubble gum um the
taste you can actually lick these off
her lips after you use them I used up a
little sample of the Laura Mercier
follow flawless skin face polish um I
cut it in half so I could get all of the
product out but this was really nice it
really really felt like it was doing
like micro dermabrasion on my skin have
really really small nice exfoliating
particles I've used up the clinic
seven-day scrub cream again cut it open
so I could get all the product of this
was nice I would say if you have really
sensitive skin this could be a really
nice scrub for you to use because it
will not irritate it has absolutely no
fragrance and you know it doesn't have
any color in it or anything like that so
a good one for sensitive skin for me I
prefer something a little more
invigorating baby something that smells
better I used up a sample of the glam
glow super mud clearing treatment really
love this if you are having breakouts
this is amazing I used up another elf
tone correcting powder and cool my go-to
setting powder for my foundation I used
up a little five towelette packet of the
ponds original fresh wet cleansing
towelettes with vitamin E to remove my
makeup I'm really into these I need to
purchase a big size of these after i'm
done with the other one
using right now because they smell so
good and they really do get makeup off
well they're not as smooth and like
pillowy soft as say the Neutrogena ones
but they really smell good and I feel
like they take off makeup better than a
lot of other cleansing towelettes so
would definitely repurchase I used up
the sominex some somni necks nighttime
sleep aid it says wake up rested and
refreshed just wanted to include that in
there because I do have issues sleeping
and this really worked well so it is all
natural or not all natural but it's it
was easy like you just take one or two
caplets like 30 minutes before bed and
it really did help me to relax and fall
asleep I used up the Shirley gross water
balancing missed I absolutely loved this
however it smells so strongly of rose
water almost to the point that it got a
little nauseating like it was too rosy
which is very hard to believe because
Rose is such a beautiful scent but this
was like really potent however I would
repurchase um I think the full size of
it is thirty-five dollars though which
is a lot but I used this to set my
makeup and I did it really really well I
used up another one of the bosha
charcoal pore minimizing hydro gel mask
you guys know how I feel about this I
gave it two tries but again the lower
half of it fell off my face so not
really feeling that one um I used up the
ginseng I mask from Sephora it's toning
and revitalizing and the Lindsey I mask
which is anti-aging and smoothing loved
both of them would repurchase I did a
whole separate video just on those 24
I'm ass I love them I used up the
scandalous by nanoucoco waterproof
mascara this just got to the point where
you know it started to like clump up on
the sides you know that it's time to get
rid of a mascara when it does that so it
was okay it wasn't that great but it was
just alright would not repurchase um I
used up the gourmet clean plus balancing
daily exfoliator cut in half
again so I could get all the product out
it says this for combination skin it
smelled really good it's not like
pomegranate it says grapefruit and prom
pomegranate it's supposed to purify the
t-zone and soften dry areas however I
would not purchase in a full size
because it just didn't have enough
exfoliating beads and I like a nice good
invigorating scrub in the morning I used
up the elf I makeup remover pads these
were great they really really worked
very well i would definitely repurchase
ah let's see here perfume samples a
sephora outrageous curl dramatic volume
and curved mascara love this mascara but
this one just kind of dragged out I got
clumpy I used up in Origins drink up
intensive overnight mask again cut it
open so I could get all the product out
it was really nice smelled really really
good and it just kind of smells like
citrus candy and it just really really
did moisturize my skin overnight I like
that I would consider purchasing a full
side to that I used up this jennifer
aniston perfume it was just in this
small bottle this is a really
interesting fragrance however I don't
think I would repurchase it just doesn't
smell that great to me um so yeah
probably wouldn't repurchase but I might
keep the bottle because it's so cute I
used up the pocket back from Bath and
Body Works in Jungle passion fruit this
was a hand gel or hand sanitizer that I
like to peak fragrance up it was not too
strong it was really subtle really
really smell nice so love that a jungle
passionfruit one I used up another elf
tone correcting powder in cool go
through so many of these and then the
rest are all perfume samples that I've
been making my way through i used up two
of these j'adore from d or two of those
um i also used up let's see here the
daisy from marc jacobs did not like that
don't like that fragrance at all dolce
from Dolce &amp;amp; Gabbana I did like that one
um spice-bomb from Viktor &amp;amp; Rolf love
that
loving all my boyfriend the most i know
that's supposed to be unisex but it
smells really good on you Daisy from
marc jacobs again I'm just not into that
send another Daisy you can tell i'm just

of them and lovey a bell from lancome
