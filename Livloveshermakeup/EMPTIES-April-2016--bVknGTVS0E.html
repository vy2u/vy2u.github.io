in today's video I'm sharing my oh my
god hold on let me situate myself my
April 2016 empties yeah I went through
so much stuff this month and a lot of
you asked me every month how do you go
through so much stuff my necklace is all
twisted I get asked a lot like how much
how do you go through so much stuff and
the reason I go through so much stuff
the only thing that I can think of is
the fact that I take all of my skincare
down my neck and like onto my decollete
so that's really the only thing I can
think of I usually go through more
skincare than makeup but for the most
part I don't know I just use a lot of
 so let's go ahead and get started
the first item I used up over the Aveeno
clear complexion daily cleansing pads
these had 25% salts like acid in them I
got them because I thought they would be
similar to my rock resurfacing discs but
they were not and I would not repurchase
they left my skin very dry and like
rough feeling sorry that just dropped
into the bin kind of loud but um they
love my skin just kind of irritated and
red and dry feeling so I did not like
them by the way if you do hear things
dropping onto the floor I have one been
over here for recycling and one for
trash so yeah alright so the next thing
I used up over these up enough cotton
swabs these are the plastic sticks these
were purple they were so cute I have
repurchased in the pink color I also
used up the up-and-up premium cotton
elbows these are the only cotton ovals
that I like to use for like toner and
removing makeup I love those I also used
up the bio republic pomegranate crush
illuminating fiber mask I believe I got
this in a subscription box it smelled
really really good and I liked the way
my skin looked after using it I used up
the chlorine mango butter hair mask I
really really enjoyed this product I
would definitely repurchase it left my
skin my skin and left my hair feeling
very very soft and it didn't look as
frazzled and like rough so I did enjoy
that I used up the Mario Badescu
strawberry face scrub which I also liked
if you do have sensitive skin and I
would highly recommend checking that
product out sorry that was so loud I
would highly recommend checking that
product out because it has a very very
light like exfoliating property to it
it's basically just a little strawberry
seeds that you might exfoliate your face
through it that's really cute
alright the next item I used up with the
Peter Thomas Roth glycolic 3 percent
acid facial wash this is what it looks
like my boyfriend and I both used that
up together I also used up the
maybelline instant age rewind eraser
dark circle treatment in the brightener
shade I enjoy this and I will definitely
repurchase I went through the Rimmel
stay matte long-lasting press powder in
the shade translucent I really enjoyed
that
I am tossing this wet and wild wild
shine in nail lacquer in the shade
tickle pink because I put it on the
other day and it smelled so bad like it
had gone bad but also it was so streaky
and it didn't used to do that so I'm
tossing that I'm also tossing the wet
and wild to juicy lip balm with SPF 15
in the raspberry scent and this has gone
bad as well it just smells like sour
which is gross my boyfriend used up the
vine Viera resveratrol skincare
moisturizer he said he did like it but I
had a very strange fragrance to it I
used to be ponds evening snoot and
evening snooze and evening soon wet
cleansing towelettes with chamomile and
white tea I really like these a lot
I personally like the ponds makeup
removing like towelette however if you
do have like sensitive skin you might
want to stay away because they are quite
texture at the actual cloth as you start
the only Henriksen grease relief
cleansing cloths these are oil free paw
refining with botanical Ajay's and
eucalyptus i love these for cleansing my
face really quickly in the morning they
do not remove makeup so don't try and
use them as a makeup remover wipe
alright I used up the bath and Bodyworks
or we used up the bath &amp;amp; Bodyworks wild
honeysuckle a deep cleansing hand soap
it's a beautiful blend of fresh
honeysuckle freesia and Dwight woods
sorry if I'm talking really fast guys I
just want to get through this video so
it's not like an hour long but that was
amazing I did already repurchase cuz it
smells so good alright the next thing I
used up was the Garnier skin active
micellar cleansing water and this was
for the sensitive skin or it's the
sensitive skin pink cap one I really
enjoyed that it will repurchase an item
I would also repurchase unfortunately at
camp because it is like they I think
they completely discontinued it is the
bare minerals mineral lictors I believe
they just discontinued the whole line
and this is the facial cleansing oil it
removes makeup really really nicely not
as well as my
Osia makeup breakup whole cleansing oil
but still it did a pretty good job I
also used up the Garnier moblins
nourishing masque in the avocado oil and
shea butter scent or you know those
properties were in there that was a
really really good I like that one and I
also liked the honey treasures one which
I also used up both of those are really
good I highly recommend checking out the
Garnier whole blends line they're like
extremely fantastic alright
I am tossing this because I just don't
like it and it leaves my skin very tacky
and sticky I used to like it and now I
hate it it is the I like organic skin
care rosehip toner and I don't know I'm
just not into this product anymore it
feels very strange on my scanner and
it's starting to like it's not really
that like that's really it reeks alright
moving on I've used up a package of
Huggies I go through these all the time
I have okay so here's four of them and
they're Elsa and Anna on the front I use
those to basically take off swatches and
also while I'm putting on my makeup to
kind of wipe my hands off I used up the
premium dr. Althea power whitening
glutathione a mask I don't know how to
say that but this is has hyaluronic acid
and pearl powder in it this was nice I
did enjoy it I used up the bath of body
works pink grapefruit a cleansing hand
soap we actually use this in the kitchen
and this is a citrus blend of ripe pink
grapefruits and Valencia orange plucked
from the tree it smelled really really
fresh and delicious
I would definitely repurchase that scent
I used up the L'Oreal Alejo Alejo Alejo
Alejo okay the olio therapy hair
expertise sulfate free deep recovery
mask the smelled really good if I could
open it yeah it smelled really really
good and I did like what it did for my
hair normally I like a product that
actually has sulfate tonight which you
know is not good for your hair but I
normally like that a little better I see
more results with like products that
have sulfates in them but I did like
that hair mask and I wouldn't repurchase
all right I've heard through the endless
weekend through what counsel from Bath
and Body Works smell so good I had it
burning in the Beauty room like right
behind me
and it says it is a blend of fresh
summer Mandarin Sunkist Magnolia and
blue coconut water that evoke dazed
sunshine and Happiness you wish would
never end and it really did smell like
happiness in a jar we burnt through to
us the lilac blossom 3 with camels these
just smell like straight up like lilacs
and a burning like in your house not
burning but you know what I mean it
smells like you have like a lilac tree
in your home it's amazing it really
really smells good they describe it as
the beauty of fresh-cut lilac indoors
with a blend of spring Musk
I don't smell the spring mess whatsoever
I just saw lilacs let me love the scent
of lilacs so we burn through those in
our living room and then I used up the
tree hatch a sugar scrub in the Moroccan
Rose sense I love these body scrubs I
talk about them all the time this one
smelled really really good kind of like
a very light version of rose if that
makes sense
and then we also used up these ocean
driftwood wallflowers my boyfriend liked
the scent of these little more manly
kind of like mahogany teak wood and we
had those in the living room yes all
right um we used up the bath &amp;amp; Bodyworks
peach Bellini deep cleansing hand soap
this is a delicious twist of juicy peach
white's apricot and fresh mango if you
have never smelled this from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works you should get it it's me happy
the scent is so good I used up these
Shea Terra moroccan rose water ester C
ester Allah mr. C facial spritz this is
99.7% natural and has collagen
regeneration properties to it this is
what it looks like this is a dupe for
the ensure a shorter leak where these
are leaked rose water balancing mist
which I absolutely love you can get that
at Sephora so I really like that product
but I would probably still repurchase
this early because I see better like
things going on with my skin when I use
that one alright so I used up the EOS
evolution of smooth shave cream this is
the pomegranate and raspberry cents this
was delicious
I love the bottle it's like hot pink
really enjoyed that I would repurchase
I used after the Revlon Photoready
airbrush mousse makeup in zero one zero
vanilla
love this this is a beautiful beautiful
color match for me as well it's not even
the lightest shade oh wait is it zero
one zero it might be the lightest shade
but anyway I really like this one a lot
it's beautiful I don't think they even
saw this foundation anymore but I had a
good time using it alright
I burned through these sugared peony and
petals through a candle from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works this smells really good my
favorite flowers in the world are
peonies so I enjoyed this it says treat
yourself to these sweet scents of sugar
peony petals atop swirls of rich vanilla
buttercream and that's what it smells
like flowers and buttercream frosting so
I did enjoy that quite a bit and yes I
would repurchase I think we burnt that
in the guest bathroom alright the next
thing I went through was the tree cut a
sugar scrub in the marula and Jasmine
scents this was another really good one
I love anything jasmine tasting or
scented so I did enjoy that I used up
the glam glow gravity mud firming
treatments which is just there firming
mask it is a peel-off mask and it's
really cool I did enjoy it and I would
repurchase I used up the L'Oreal True
Match in mineral instant shiny eraser
mattifying powder in the shade and one
too I would repurchase I enjoyed that a
lot I also used up the studio 35 Beauty
pre premium cotton Browns I would not
repurchase they were super rough and
horrible and the only reason I used
those was because I was too lazy to go
to Target and get the up-and-up once and
I was like she should've just got me up
an app once alright moving on I used up
the essence all about Mac 16 compact
powder and yeah that is a great one I
love it so I actually used up two of
those so yes
two of the essence all about Matt 15
compact powders I used up these secrets
clear gel scent expressions deodorant in
the Mako 1000 sense this is delicious it
smells so good but I will not repurchase
because I'm trying to find a natural
deodorant all right I used up the code
elite beauty elixir this is a smoothing
and glowing complexion spray it's
amazing it feels really tingly on the
skin I would say it kind of tones the
skin
then like moisturizes and if that makes
sense
alright I burned through the blueberries
and cream through the candle from Bath
and Body Works actually three months for
two of the in the living room they
smelled amazing like literally like
blueberries and cream and it says sweet
vanilla cream a garden blueberries and
hint of sugar combine in this
mouth-watering fragrance and the minute
seriously smells good
yes loved that would definitely
definitely repurchase that scent next
spring for sure all right the next thing
I am tossing because I just didn't get
to it soon enough this is the I love
strawberries and cream feel scrumptious
with a burst of fresh strawberries and
cream yummy yummy body butter but that
is what it looks like and just had gone
bad it stinks a breaks alright moving on
we went through the bath and Bodyworks
fresh sparkling snow deep cleansing hand
so if they had such cute packaging
during the wintertime it's like sparkles
on there but this is a blend of icy pear
and melon frosted with winter and musk I
like to spend it's not one that I would
like go out of my way to purchase next
year again I didn't think of anything
but it was going alright I used up the
nourishing coconut milk shampoo from OGX
I love this brand and I really enjoyed
the shampoo so I would repurchase I used
up the suave professionals salon proven
intense moisture mask this is the
coconut milk infusion one this is an
amazing hair mask if you have really
really coarse dry hair or either just
really fine hair like me mine somewhat
dry I think you would enjoy this it
smell so good
no gasm I definitely would repurchase
that I am tossing this pure minerals
mineral blush in the shade Polynesian
pink it is beautiful oh my god smells so
bad I did not even know that blushes
could start to smell bad this Rhys I
know I keep saying reeks but it really
really smells horrible and it's such a
beautiful color it kind of reminds me of
narcissus orgasm like it's that
beautiful peachy color with golden sheen
but it doesn't even go into the cheeks
anymore like I opened this the other day
I was trying to put it on my cheeks and
then I was like oh my god first of all
it smells second about nothing's going
on my cheeks so yeah topic Matt
I used up the it cosmetics bye bye pores

the translucent version this is the
loose version and I love it I will
definitely repurchase I already have
repurchased I used up the caviar
anti-aging replenishing moisture
Millican leave-in conditioner this was
just okay I would not go out of my way
to repurchase this alright the next
thing I am talking because it gave me a
horrible reaction underneath my eyes
this is the Clarkes botanicals aunt a
puff eye cream I don't even want to give
this to a friend because it literally
made my eyes so puffy and red I'm scared
it was to it to them as well so I'm just
gonna toss this I believe I got that in
my boxycharm box for the month of was it
last month yeah it was last month

doesn't have a lid but this is the lemon
mint tea 3-wood candle from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works oh my god this smells so good I
have to get another one of these it's so
good it says it is a refreshing blend of
spearmint leaves combined with fresh
zesty lemon and berbay not to delight
your senses and it really smells good
like a smells like black tea with mint

container of the Real Techniques deep
cleansing gel this cleans like your
little SpongeBob's your little beauty
blenders and stuff like that or your
little Real Techniques sponges and also
it deep cleans your makeup brushes it's
just okay I would not go out of my way
to repurchase it again I used up the
Dove nutritive therapy nourishing oil
care Leoben smoothing cream with
weightless neutral oils it controls up
to a hundred percent of frizz in your
hair and actually does that this is
amazing I will repurchase this I think

wonderland pocket back from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works loved it
