thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having a fantastic day I am
here to share my empties for the month
of December as you can see I have a lot
yet again so let's go ahead and just get
started and I'll let you guys know what
I will repurchase and what I won't be
repurchasing I want to let you know
right away none of the samples that I
showed in sample week will be in here
these are all different products that I
used so the first product I used up was
the missiles of Meyers clean gay hand
soap this is the cranberry cents this
was their limited edition soap it
smelled really really good it was really
really nice had a lovely formula and did
not dry my hands out too much so I would
repurchase the next product I used up
was from Bath and Body Works these are
the fresh balsam wallflowers we had
these in the living room around
Christmas time they just smell like a
Christmas tree really really awesome
loved those would definitely repurchase
next year I use just the batiste dry
shampoo this is the wild scent it is
sassy and daring would definitely
repurchase this I love this scent and I
love the formula of the batiste dry
shampoos I used up these skintimate
moisturizing shave gel this is the
raspberry rain scent I really enjoy this
a lot I don't feel like it really really
helps to guard against any Nick's or
things like that that you might like
when you cut yourself you know I feel
like the Trader Joe's one is a lot
better for that it's a lot more
moisturizing but this one foams up
really nicely have a nice lather and yes
it does get the job done my boyfriend
and I went through the Peter Thomas Roth
anti-aging cleansing gel this is
oil-free anti-wrinkle technology it's
tough salicylic acid in a glycolic acid
all the good acids it was really really
good that lasted a whole year so
definitely worth it I used up the
Neutrogena triple moisture deep recovery
hair mask
I would definitely repurchase I
mentioned that in my top 5 hair mask
video another hair mask I'd used up with
the renewing argan oil of Morocco
intense moisturizing treatment from
organics it looks like this I really
really love to this as well I would
repurchase I went through the Huggies
these are just baby wipes I use these to
wipe out swatches and also wipe my hands
while I'm doing my makeup I used up a
pack of the elf studio makeup removing
cleansing cloths oh I would repurchase
these and the baby wipes by the way
these are really really nice they stay
really really moist all the way to the
bottom of the pack so I love them
another pack of the Huggies baby wipes I
need stuff the L'Oreal Hydra fresh toner
it's alcohol-free really nice if you
have sensitive skin highly recommend
like this a lot it's also really really
nice if you pop it in the fridge and
then you put it on your face in the
morning it just feels so like nice and
just like oh I just woke up you know it
really wakes you up I used up a whole
bottle of the Protandim this is from
LifeVantage this is an nrf2 synergize
err and this is just something that I
take I have lupus which is an autoimmune
disease and this is just something that
might do my doctor of Osteopathic
Medicine recommended I take it's just
kind of like a vitamin supplement and it
helps to calm my body down and just help
so that I don't have as many flare-ups
so I really really do like that a lot
another product I used up was the deep
cleansing hand soap from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works this is the Mary cookie scent it
smelled really really good it is a mix
of buttery sugar cookies I stood with
vanilla bourbon frosting it just smelled
like sugar cookies it was awesome
alright another packet of the elf Studio
a makeup remover cleansing cloth love
them and I also do stuff these two
makeup removing wipes I used up the
Athena ultra combing makeup removing
wipes really really nice if you have dry
skin also the Neutrogena makeup remover
cleansing towelettes in the night
cleansing right no nice calming formula
love these as well they smelled really
really good I would repurchase both of
those let's see here I have some young
Souls the first one is the three with
candles from battle buddy works this is
the tis the season this is my favorite
winter candle that they come out with
every year so I love it and I will
definitely repurchase
I also
the heirloom pumpkin three wick candle
this was really really nice it is a
blend of fresh pumpkin creamy nutmeg and
rich brown sugar if you don't like the
really really sweet sense that they come
out with during the fall and winter time
you'd probably like this a lot because I
have kind of a warmer spicy or sort of
scent to it but you still get back you
know you still get your fix up pumpkin
if that makes sense really really good
another hair mask that I mentioned in my
top five series this is the L'Oreal
total repair 5
damn you GE Racing bomb I have another
one of these in my shower right now
absolutely love it I also used up the
Pantene masks another one that I
mentioned I will link that video below
because I think all of the masks that I
mentioned in that video are in this
empties the Garnier Fructis damage
erasers strength reconstructing butter
another one fantastic if you have really
dry hair I burned through the Bath and
Body Works marshmallow fireside tree
with candle really really like the scent
of this this year everybody raves about
this and I it was never a really huge
fan don't get me wrong I really do like
that kind of woodsy scent but I just
thought it was kind of strange mixed
with the marshmallow scent but this year
it really just smells like marshmallow
to me
I barely smell any of like the burning
woods kind of scent so I liked it a lot
I need stuffy bath and Bodyworks winter
candy apple o wallflowers I had these in
my beauty room they smell amazing just
really really sweet candy sort of scent
if that makes sense and a little bit of
apple in there as well really good thing
I would repurchase I would also
repurchase this swamp professionals
color care dry shampoo this is fantastic
it leaves no residue on your hair
no white cast anything like that really
really fantastic it doesn't really give
you any volume or anything but it really
just sucks up the oils which I feel like
is the main purpose of having a dry
shampoo all right I used up or went
through my whole Lilly Pulitzer agenda
for August 2014 through December 2015 I
did purchase a different one I have it
right behind me I'm it's a little out of
huh a little out of reach but it's
really really great I got actually the
extra large one this time I love it even
more than this one this is the large one
but I love these Lilly Pulitzer agendas
they're just great they keep me really
on schedule with work and you know
two videos I want to film and just life
in general little tasks that I want to
complete I write them down and then I
basically do like checklist style and I
cross them up as I go throughout my day
and I just love it but this was a
fantastic one and the print was really
really cute and happy and uplifting I
went through or burnt through the Yankee
candle in the pumpkin wreath sent this
took forever for me to burn through it
was really really good
very very creamy pumpkin sort of scent I
mentioned this in my fall top fall
favorite Campbell's video I will be
doing a top winter candles video as well
or my favorite winter candles video so
I'm super excited for that but I'm
definitely going to reuse this jar it is
glass it's beautiful you could probably
pop like cotton balls or something in
there or even lipsticks lip balms
whatever you want to do I used up the
dr. Dennis gross alpha-beta peel
original elevate appeal original formula
it's step one which is a surface refiner
and in step two is the deeper treatment
he did this really really was not good
for my skin I just absolutely no no it
made me break out like I'm gonna be late
I get stuff perfume yeah I've used up
the vintage bloom perfume from Jessica
Simpson absolutely beautiful bottle and
even more gorgeous beautiful scent feel
like that didn't make sense even more
gorgeous even I used up the EOS
evolution of smooth a shaped cream this
is the lavender Jasmine scent oh my gosh
this was so good I love love love this
shape gel absolutely beautiful and I
love the scent of jasmine anything
Jasmine scented I know I'm gonna love I
even am using a toothpaste right now
that is like jasmine flavored and so
good alright I used up the Crabtree and
Evelyn verbena and lavender do Provence
this is a body wash it was beautiful it
smelt like a spa it was just really
really like therapeutic aromatherapy
times ten I would definitely purchase a
full-size of that I used up the loom
blackberry of sinneth e S&amp;amp;P luxury
scented candle this was just okay I
prefer my Bath and Body Works candles so
I would not purchase a full-size of that
I used up the Sephora Lotus sleeping
mask loves this I love these sleeping
masks from Sephora they're fantastic I
love all of them so I would repurchase I
used up a Clarisonic brush head this is
the luxe one it's the really really soft
bristles really really fantastic love
this particular brush head it really has
changed the way the Clarisonic works for
my skin very very gentle and lovely I
used up this was so funny this was the
spotlight lip mask it literally was like
a little jelly lip mask that you put
over your lips and I was all about it I
loved it I used it before a performance
one night you guys know I play flute and
it really really moisturized my lips it
was like the best thing ever so I have
like ten more of those to go through and
I'm really excited I used up the phyto
phyto finesse a hair and nails dietary
supplement love these have already
repurchased really really good they
really make my hair healthy they make it
feel healthy they make it shinier I've
noticed a lot of new growth lately and
not that I'm really trying to grow my
hair any longer I'm kind of maintaining
the length I have now just by getting
trims once in a while but it really
makes my hair nice and soft and
manageable and it's helping with tangles
as well that's my number one problem as
far as my like hair is concerned
tangling is a huge issue so that really
really helps I used up the NYC smooth
skin pressed face powder and 7:01 a
translucent I use this up all the way to
the pad and a really really good
fantastic fantastic powder to set in
your foundation I would definitely
repurchase I use dusty Mario Badescu
whitening mask really really love this
I've had this forever
it just works really really well to help
remove dark spots on your face and help
kind of brighten your skin up I do have
acne scarring
I have hormonal acne so I get acne along
the jaw line
sometimes on my neck and around my
cheekbones basically so I really really
love that
really really help to lighten them up I
mean you could literally see an
immediate difference after rinsing it
off so fantastic another hair mask that
I mentioned in my top five here math
video like I said that video will be
linked below this is the Aussie 3 minute
miracle moist absolutely love this
fantastic fantastic alright let's see
here I used up with this Ren keep young
and beautiful instant from me beauty
shop this really did tighten up my skin
however I would not purchase a full size
of it I just don't really need to work
on like tightening like my face as much
I do like it like don't get me wrong it
really really kind of sculpts and
contours your face but it's just not
something I would purchase a full size
if it kind of made like my face unable
to sort of move if that makes sense like
I have like gotten like it's like
putting Botox on your hand and then like
rubbing it on your face it just felt so
stiff I mean I've never done Botox they
don't know what it actually feels like
but it just felt really really tight and
I almost felt like I couldn't really
play my flute because I was like you
know and it was like can't move my face
but anyway yeah I would never just say
both sides of that I used up the drive
bar hydrating shots this is the Bay
Breeze I really like these they're
really really nice for detangling and
nice for special occasions I used up the
pocket back from yes this is the
antibacterial hand gel in cozy vanilla
cream and smelled amazing really really
enjoyed that a lot I used up another one
of those dr. Dennis gross alpha-beta
peels hated them like I said a really
really crappy product this made me break
out wasn't for my skin type you can get
tons of other resurfacing you know peels
like that like the one from what is it
the fab brand what is that called again
first aid beauty yes fab first aid
beauty and also the ones from Peter
Thomas Roth the unwrinkle peel pads are
way better than those I used a pico de
lis beauty elixir beauty elixir
this is smoothie and it's supposed to
give you a glowing complexion it really
does it kind of has like the Cass life
eucalyptus or tea tree in it as well it
really really like tightens your skin up
and kind of tones it it feels kind of
tingly it's wonderful I would definitely
repurchase
I use that in the morning after my
skincare and also at night after my
skincare all right I used up the tonkin
waar luxury scented candle from Illuma
this was just okay I like this one
better than the blackberry one but again
I prefer my bath and Bodyworks at Yankee
Candles and Chesapeake Bay candles I
used up the elf tone correcting powder
and cool love this I purchased
repurchase this all the time it's like
my top favorite like setting powder ever
uh-huh it just sets so beautifully this
color is really really nice they do have
cooler undertones in my skin so it works
very very well for me used up to
wallflowers i don't know why i have
these in here since i showed you guys
the actual little Wallflower boxes
probably won't do this again next month
um let's see here I've used up the
Revlon nearly naked pressed powder and
zero-one-zero fair absolutely love this
I have repurchased I've gone through
another one that you'll see next empties
video in the next one and also I
purchased another one so I really really
do like it I am wearing it today it is a
tad dark on my skin but when I do the
buffing technique with my it cosmetics
what is it called bye-bye pores powder
it kind of lightens it up so it works
another one of those Bay Breeze
hydrating shots from dry bar like I said
really really nice for special occasions
they are a little pricey though I've
used up the Rimmel match perfection a
two-in-one concealer and highlighter and
my shave is 125 fair really really like
this I would repurchase it really does
highlight nicely underneath the eyes and
it does conceal as well I used up see
Fig &amp;amp; Olive bath salts I don't know if
that's the brand but these were really
nice I just love epsom salts anything
like that that you can put in your bath
especially if you have like a key
muscles or like cramps or something it
really really helps alright and then I
used a three more of those Sephora
little mono pods these are the masks
I've used up the Sephora honey sleeping
mask really fantastic again I really
enjoyed that one this is probably my
favorite one this is the ginseng
sleeping mask I felt like this was very
very energizing and brightening on my
skin and then I used up these Sephora
jelly mask this is moisturizing and
energizing I like to put this in the
refrigerator and I can get quite a few
uses
out of that and then I used up two
little perfume samples the versace
bright crystal i already own a full-size
of this i love it
and also the lancome la VA Bev and I
would probably purchase a full-size of
this down the line alright guys those
were my empties for a month I really
hope you guys oh my gosh wait a minute
there's something that I dropped it's
down here Oh hair going everywhere
luckily I saw that because this is a
fantastic product and I'm totally
obsessed with it I used up these simple
cleansing micellar water this must have
fallen out at the beginning that was
probably the thing that fell on the
floor I heard it go alright but yeah
this is fantastic it cleanses it removes
makeup and hydrates
it's amazing you guys will see me talk
about this on Thursday when I talk about
my 2015 favorites like skin care
products or like must have you know Holy
Grail skin care products this is one of
them I absolutely love it it's fantastic
