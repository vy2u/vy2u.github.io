thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having an absolutely
fantastic day I am here to share my
empties for the month with you guys I
originally was going to be filming a
look or a tutorial on the look that I'm
wearing today but I had to put that on
hold because my empty thing is starting
to overflow again and I wanted to empty
it out before it really starts to
overflow and really really drive me nuts
so let's just get right into it I'm
gonna share with you guys what I've used
up this month so the first thing that we
used up was the 3-wood candle from Bath
and Body Works in spiced apple toddy
this smelled really really really good
it is a sweet mixture of winter fruits
apple brandy and spiced plum and it
smells so good it was definitely what if
I went to a favorites the next thing
that I used up was the Pantene pro-v 3
minute miracle repair and protect a deep
conditioner
I really really am liking these Pantene
has recently released like this 3 minute
miracle I'm kind of like the Aussie one
and so one of my subscribers told me
that Aussie and is owned by Pantene or
Pantene owns Aussie or something like
that so that would probably make sense
so anyway these are really really good
they smell like candy and they make my
hair really really soft so yeah I enjoy
that's a lot i juiced up in the
abandoned Body Works twisted peppermint
Wallflower I have these in the Beauty
room right now and honestly I can barely
smell them I don't know what it is they
have like no centra whatsoever so I
probably would not purchase repurchase
those next year
alright did we used up the Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works eucalyptus mint deep cleansing
hand soap it is a refreshing scent of
fresh mint crisp you película crisp yoga
lifted and sweet Clary sage I like this
my boyfriend loved it and we had it in
the master bathroom and he is not really
into all of the super super sweet scents
like I am so usually I have these super
sweet scents in the guest bathroom and
then we put in the main bathroom we put
something like this in so he really
really enjoyed this smells really good
alright I burst through the Yankee
Candle in vanilla icing I had this in
the beauty room it started to get really
grossed towards the top like all the
smoke filled up but this smells amazing
one of my favorite tea candles I used up
by simple micellar cleansing water this
was my all-time favorite cleansing water
I have picked up the Garnier ones I'm
liking them so far but I feel like this
one is definitely a lot more gentle so I
still
for this one I think but I prefer the
pink one over the blue one with the
garden-gate so far all right the label
is off of this one I took it off because
I recently put together we have like
these little wreaths that were sitting
around and I recently put together a
little centerpiece and I put a candle
right in the middle of the wreath so I
wanted to take the label off so that it
looked like a cute little centerpiece
but this is the joy a peppermint
marshmallow 3 lit candle from Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works it says indulge in the
fragrance of fluffy vanilla marshmallows
which are full of holiday sweetness and
peppermint joy it smells good but
honestly there was like no scent throw
with this so I would not repurchase next
year all right something I would
repurchase they both shall make up break
up coal cleansing oil you guys know this
is my all-time favorite way to remove my
makeup it's just a lovely lovely
luxurious oil that leaves no residue on
the skin and washes off immediately I
went through a couple packets of baby
wipes I like to use these to wipe my
hands while I'm doing my makeup and also
for swatches and things like that
I need something about teeth dry shampoo
and be light and blog this have like a
blonde into it I really really love it I
think it's really nice on my hair and I
love the Vitesse or batiste formula
alright we burned through the fresh
sparkling snow through the camel from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works it says in winter all
the glitters in snow and are sparkling
blend of icy pear frozen melon and
frosted musk captures all of the seasons
sparkle and shine it didn't smell that
good the description is better I thought
it was ok but I would not be purchased I
really did like the label that way I
thought it looked really pretty baby
pretty I did burn that in the bedroom
actually alright I used up this is a
phone case I purchased a new phone case
this is one of those like water phone
cases and ended up just like all the
water got sucked out of it I don't know
what happened if I broke it or something
you probably have water damage on my
phone now whatever I got a new one I
order those for really really cheap on
eBay they're like three dollars they're
adorable
alright I've used up the elf tone
correcting powder and cool of course
that is my all-time favorite setting
powder I also used up the NYX blotting
powder this shade is BL p01 light or
Clair completely use that up I used up
the only hundreds in nurture meat
cleansing cloths these are makeup
remover
with Moringa and barage seed oil they
remove all traces of waterproof makeup
they smelled is really really good they
smell like the truce line if you've ever
smelled the truth line from Olay
Heinrichs then it smells like orange
creamsicles that's what these smelled
like however they didn't remove my
makeup at all so I would not repurchase
all right I used up the nature made
sleep natural and natural acting natural
absolutely eight I really really like
these they have melatonin in them three
milligrams and they work pretty well I
cannot sleep at night unless I take a
sleeping supplement because I don't know
I just can't sleep I'm very hyper person
so I really liked those we used up the
vanilla snowflake a little dual pack of
wallflowers these smokes so good it's
like a mix of vanilla and vanilla and
something else I don't know but it
smelled really good alright I used up my
oh I hope I'm not flashing my address I
used up my omega-3 acids ethyl esters
these are basically just the generic for
Lavazza which is a fish oil supplement I
take four grams of this a day love it we
used up the Alpine tier three wick
candle the smelled amazing it's not very
similar to autumn actually they used up
two of these it smells very similar to
the scent autumn so if you like to send
autumn you should pick up Alpine here
during the winter next year because they
smell so so so similar we also burned
through the winter three whit Campbell I
use this in the Beauty room here it
smells so good and also the just the
season three wick campbell which smells
amazing it's my all-time favorite
Christmas and winter scent I used up my
all-time favorite shampoo up all time
this is the best from the drugstore and
high-end it is the suave professionals
Moroccan infusion salon proven color
care shampoo amazing smells amazing
ladders up like a dream cleans my hair
like no other it's amazing the best re I
used up the tree hot shave sugar scrub
in the Hawaiian Kukui scent this smells
really really nice I enjoyed it quite a
lot and then I also used up this face
wrap this is the cucumber and aloe it's
soothing refreshing and it's a 20 minute
facial therapy it's basically just one
of those sheep masks I really enjoyed it
it was nice or if the next thing I used
up it was or we used up was the orchard
frosty cleansing hands out the smelled
amazing
look at the beautiful packaging - it
smells so good I love anything Apple
sentence yeah it smelled like apples it
says it is a frosted Apple shine scent
in winter sunlight I'm sorry frosted
apples shine in winter sunlight it's not
very descriptive but it's not like
apples alright moving on I used up a
Clarisonic luxe cashmere cleanse high
performance brush head and I'm gonna
show you because it's super gummed up
but this is my all-time favorite brush
head from Clarisonic it's the best
alright
I used up the covergirl plus al a CC
cream tone rehab Foundation of 105 ivory
I absolutely adore this it is the best
CC cream ever better than the cosmetics
one in my opinion alright I used up the
pawns original fresh wet clipping
towelettes with vitamin E I really
really love these it would repurchase
I've used up the NYX do we finish
long-lasting setting spray this was
really really nice and I also would
repurchase alright I do stuff the only
Henriksen grease relief cleansing cloths
these are oil-free pore refining they
have botanical AJ's and eucalyptus to
exfoliate clarify and refine the pores I
would repurchase these are so nice in
the morning when you just want to
cleanse your face quickly I used up
three packs of baby wipes again the Olay
Henriksen the clean truth cleansing
cloth easily brightening ones with
vitamin C and coq10 they cleanse
brighten and hydrate smell like orange
creamsicle really really good love these
I would repurchase I used tough to these
your league rose water balancing mist
this is one of my holy grails I
currently am using a dupe so I'll finish
up the dupe and if I want to repurchase
this I might but we shall see I used up
these Smashbox photo finish primer water
this is amazing I really really love
this as they setting spray and I feel
like it does crime your face I used up
the it cosmetics by my pores airbrush
silk press finishing powder this was
nice I probably would not purchase I
preferred the loose version which is
harder to work with but I just prefer it
I used up these little earrings sounds
weird I used them up no I basically
these started to get all bent out of
shape and I've had them forever so I
thought I would just toss them I buy
really really cheap jewelry those were
from forever 21 so it's not a big deal
and then I used up this little
Oh in frosted cranberry these are wall
flowers we actually have these in the
living room it smelled really really
good I love this frosted cranberry scent
it is one that I pick up every single
year I used up the Loreal every pure
sulfate free repair remedy mask the
smell horrible it was so overwhelming
and strong oh my god
it smells like men's shaving cream which
you think would smell good but this is
just overwhelming and too strong and it
felt like shaving cream and my hair was
very strange alright I used up the I
would not repurchase I used up the
Marvis whitening mint toothpaste I also
would not repurchase this I don't think
it's worth of money whatsoever I used up
the Real Techniques deep cleansing gel
this is amazing at cleaning your beauty
sponges your Beauty Blender your Real
Techniques sponge amazing so I would
repurchase this let's see here I used up
the up enough premium cotton ovals I've
become a cotton oval snob I only will
use these ones they are from the up and
up brand which you see compared to brand
from Target they're amazing they're
really really nice they're textured on
one side and soft on the other and
they're just super thick and luxurious I
used up the patch ology hydrate splash
mask this was just a sleep my sleeping
mask a sheet mask it was really really
nice I actually use that this week I
liked it a lot
alright this blush has to go it is past
its prime it smells so bad yeah it's bad
but it's a beautiful beautiful color
this is the pure minerals mineral blush
and cherry opal and it's just so
textured and it's a gorgeous color but
it is it is definitely past its prime it
smells so bad
alright so I also used up and the clean
and clear makeup dissolving facial
cleansing wipes they instantly dissolve
dirt oil and makeup even waterproof
mascara loves these will definitely
repurchase they kind of leave a cold
tingly feeling on your skin they're
really awesome I've used up a lipstick
the bites dual ended lipstick in the
shades um
cafe and pepper you guys can see I
basically have completely used up each
side there's only a tiny tiny little bit
more left this was a beautiful lipstick
I love these little dual ended lipsticks
from bite Beauty they're so premium they
are such a luxurious formula great
pigmentation
I used up this little shampoo in
Mandarin and mint from the Sheraton I
used this to clean my makeup brushes it
was really good I used up or this went
past its time this is the body drench
cotton candy it was smells so bad it you
smell so so good if you body turns
cotton candy had delicious moisturizing
lip balm it just smells like it has gone
bad so I'm tossing that I used up the
Marvis ginger mint again would not
repurchase these are just not worth the
money in my opinion that's a toothpaste
all right and then the last two things
are earrings again these just got really
old and a little like part where you put
it in your ear got all bent out of shape
so they're really really cute I've had
these for like five years they were from
forever 21 and they were just really
really cheap little rope earrings I
thought they were adorable but they are
past their prime so they are being
tossed as well so what is it guys those
