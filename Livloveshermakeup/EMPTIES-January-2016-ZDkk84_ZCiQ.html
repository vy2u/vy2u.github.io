have my empties for the month here for
you guys today that is not my bra strap
that is a tank top but anyway I want to
see something really really quickly I
did get my hair done today and every
time I get my hair done I know it's one
of those strange things where everybody
like loves after they get their hair
down they like wear it down and whatnot
I always end up putting mine in a bun
because of my stylist actually uses two
toners on my hair so what happens is she
will when I bleach my hair basically she
is the purple toner to kind of tone down
the brassiness my hair pulls a lot of
brassy colors like lots of orange and
give me lots of orange and yellow tones
and then she actually sprays in a toner
at the end after she is completely cut
and blow-dried my hair and it actually
has a green undertone so if my hair
looks a little yellow or green and that
is why it does wash out after I wash my
hair but it's so funny because I walked
into my building and there are a bunch
of some of the girls that were working
down there kind of looking at me like
it's wrong with your hair but anyway it
does kind of wash out when I wash my
hair so don't be frightened of my
previous yellow hair but anyway I am
here to share my expertise I have them
in this adorable little bag right here
that I got in my pot sugar must-have box
and I have a lot of empty I want to know
do you guys are you guys okay with me
filming empty it's like right like a
week before the beginning of the month
normally you guys know I film them a day
or two before like the beginning of the
new month but it's okay if I film them
like just like the last week it doesn't
really matter does it let me know which
one you guys prefer I always think that
people will only want to see it like a
day or two before but if you guys don't
mind sometimes my empties get to the
point where literally I have to have
like two different bags and I think that
you know sometimes I'm like oh my god
that last week especially I'm like hey
like I can't wait any longer so please
let me know if you would mind and let's
just get right into it shall we
the first things that I used up is these
snuggle infant boosters these are
concentrated
sent packs that you throw into your
laundry to make your laundry smell good
and this is the long lasting scent in
the Blue Iris list it has 56 little
packets in here I got this at Target oh
my god
it smells so good you're right it smells
so so so good so I put these to make a
my laundry Sun bed I put them in my wash
I don't put them in my boyfriend's
because he is a very very sensitive to
scent and he just can't handle it he
just can't hang with it so I do them for
mine
alright you guys may have seen this if
my what's in my purse bag I usually
carry like makeup or little things
around in my purse with in these little
bags wait it's like yeah it's like a bag
was in a bag anyway this is like my
little crazy cat lady bag that I got at
forever 21 and I love it so much
however I realized after I had filmed
that video that I have had this for
almost two years and I was like this
game a little grungy it's a little dirty
on the inside I think I carried like
makeup and stuff in here so it's just it
just doesn't look very great so I
actually like hoard a lot of these like
I have probably 16 little pouches that I
keep it really closest so I'm gonna head
and grab to me why Amy and that's the
one that that I'm going to use it so
that is going the next thing that I used
up is the john frieda luxurious volume 7
date volume with protein and keratin in
shower treatment this did nothing from
my hair it really was not good at all
I have very very flat fine hair which
probably couldn't tell like right now my
hair actually looks crazy but I do I
have very very fine flat hair that just
doesn't do anything with volume her body
and did not do anything all right moving
on my boyfriend bought this from Sephora
I know like that makes me so proud to
say that my boyfriend actually went and
he bought things from Sephora like by
himself I didn't even have to encourage
him this is the derma dr. KP duty
dermatologist formulated body scrub it's
got chemical and physical exfoliators in
it and this is for KP which is like that
what's called cateura skyrocket alright
kept tourists Polaris Couture Asst
Polaris it's not read cater ice skaters
Polaris pilaris
peeler is okay you don't know it's
called KP and basically it's those
little bumps that you get on your upper
arms you can get them anywhere on your
body but it's very common to get them on
your upper
I have it on my upper arms I shove it
right now and I'm wearing one of those
little peekaboo shirts probably
shouldn't have done that but yes I have
KP he s KP and he went ahead and used
half of this and he was like it kind of
burns because I had physical and
chemical exfoliator in there and the
chemical exfoliator czar eh-eh so it
kind of like burns off the top layer of
the skin and he was like I don't like it
so I used it up it was not good
whatsoever this is like $32 it's just
not worth it you can get rid of KP and
you can help with KP with any sort of
body scrub you do not need some sort of
expensive $35 special KP chicken-skin
one and there it is a little sticking on
the front because that's what a car
looks like chicken skin alright I have
spent way too much time talking about
that moving on we burnt through these
fish balls some three with candle from
Bath and Body Works I love this oh god
yeah it smells like a Christmas tree it
says breathe in the invigorating
fragrance of snow dusted balsam fir
trees and eucalyptus leaves it's amazing
it just it's not like a Christmas tree
it smells like Christmas in a candle all
right I think they be formulated this
let me know if they did because it did
not work for me this time around it's
the macadamia natural oil deep repair
mask I usually get it in the tub and I
don't know if that's maybe why this one
did it work for me this one is in like
the little squeezy bottle but this has
3.3 fluid ounces in it it smell
different some little musky maybe it
went bad it's strange because I recently
purchased this I haven't been seen
around in my collection or anything but
yeah it's a revitalizing Reconstructor
is just a deep conditioning mask but I
swear they have changed the formula it
smells different it's not as thick and I
don't felt I don't felt like I don't
feel like it did anything for my hair
honestly and this is this kind of this
mask usually does a lot for my hair so
I'm a little confused I will not
repurchase alright moving on these
sparkling icicles well flowers these
smell so good they smell like a 60 men
and yeah there's just not a lot to say
they smell like a sexy man if you like
those kind of more like manly scents
from Bath and Body Works you would love
Sparkman bicycles really really good
alright I used up the skintimate
signature scents raspberry rain shape
gel this is a favorite of mine it's
really really good I enjoy
I've used up the pawns original fresh
wept cleansing towelettes with vitamin E
I love these they smell good they are a
little abrasive like they have some
exfoliating things on they're not
exfoliating beads or anything but they
have kind of like a rough texture so if
you have sensitive skin stay away one of
my favorite hair masks I used up I will
definitely repurchase is the L'Oreal
total repair 5 damage erasing balm I
love this a lot I used up this scrub is
absolutely my favorite my brief unlike
this one to get this instead of the
chicken skin one this is the tree gotcha
sugar scrub and passionfruit and guava
all of them smell amazing I'm such a fan
of tree hut like the brand just in
general but their sprouts are amazing
love it I will repurchase we used up the
taste of season 3 with candle from Bath
and Body Works it smells like Christmas
it's amazing another fresh balsam candle
is a three week as well right now I have
these cinnamon and clove buds this is
the little dual pack of wallflowers I
have them in Meganium right now I'm
looking at them they smell really good
it smells like cinnamon and it closed
really good
all right I've used up three of the
mark-anthony I know there's three but I
only find two right here but anyway
there's three of the mark-anthony
hydrating coconut oil shea butter deep
nourishing conditioning treatments these
are amazing they smell great and they
make your hair really silky and soft we
used up high we used up in the kitchen
the bath and body were expec cherry
Merlot deep cleansing hand soaps it's an
addictive blend of dark cherry black
Chris Brown Bella raspberry and scrubs
just Merlot it's not amazing good
alright I get stuff at the Pantene pro-v
3 minute miracle sheer volume deep
conditioner it's a miracle conditioning
reflect or fine hair I do not notice a
difference in volume but it smells like
candy and a movement her sauce that I
will repurchase I love these these are
my favorite favorite favorite little
cotton pads that I use for my toner and
also turn with my makeup these are the
up and up premium cotton ovals these are
the only ones I will use I'm very picky
they're pretty cheap but they're amazing
they've got a textured side and then a
soft science the L'Oreal Hydra fresh
toner love this I bought
repurchase let's see two more three wick
candles the twisted peppermint will not
repurchase it ended up giving me a
headache
but these sparkling icicles these sexy
man fans I will repurchase yes I will
repurchase all right
true blue sash a cashmere hair
conditioner it smells like amaretto like
the drink on moranto like the alcoholic
beverage or it smells like amaretto
cookies of little almond cookies that
you get Italy really really delicious it
only smells good into absolutely nothing
for my hair so I will not repurpose all
right they bath and Bodyworks no kiss
citrus deep cleansing hand soap it's
sugary printer lemons that listen in the
first snowfall of winter that's what the
bottle looks like it is so good it smell
great we liked it a lot
my boyfriend and I both used up the code
early resveratrol this is the night
infusion cream we both really like this
a lot it is quite pricey I think it's
around 80 or 90 dollars but it's very
very good
I will not repurchase this this is the
elf brush shampoo it did it just wasn't
special I'm not going to say it didn't
do anything it did clean my brushes but
it's nothing nothing that like the baby
shampoo can't do so yes the oven
cleaners channel this is for oily
blemish prone skin it's got mono Lauren
in it and it is nice I do like it a lot
but I don't think I would purchase a
full price it wasn't that memorable my
little Huggies and it got Elsa on the
front look at her beautiful little
braids I use these to wipe off swatches
I used them to wipe my hands in between
makeup all that kind of sets another
little thing of Huggies he's at the
Mickey Mouse Lutz let's see they got the
body works winter wonderland deep
cleansing hat so this is a winter
berries snowy vanilla and crystallized
ginger they fill the air I just love the
way they describe notice is kind of
sense but really key a little on
messaging and loved it
we've had this forever in the guest
bathroom this would be pumpkin pitstop
this is just the Glade spray we've had
this since September and literally it
smelled great but I took forever to go
through it smells very very nice we
would repurchase I like to have these in
the bathrooms to kind of just fish in
the air
alright I used up the Dove dry spray in
the nourish debuted
I would repurchase that I don't think I
will cuz I have been using a natural
deodorants that I've actually been
really enjoying which I will talk about
in my battle of the natural deodorants
video alright we used up a decorative
hand soap from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works to peel
like little old labels off of this alone
because they're so pretty I didn't want
to have the people on there I don't
remember what scent it was but I'm sure
it was good I've used up the Raspberry
Ketones these are Beauty slim gummies
these are just okay I thought they would
help with my sugar craving I'm not
trying to lose weight or anything but I
find that the hug nutrition skinny bird
supplements are much better for me
alright two more packs of Huggies baby
wipes another Mickey Mouse and awesome
is my favorite I know everybody loves
Elsa I love Anna okay the bargains me
another hydrating coconut oil
conditioning treatment really fantastic
these summer's eve island splash
cleansing wash this is for a go
downstairs area it's very very nice and
cracked like candy so yes I would
repurchase oh my god
I used up the bath &amp;amp; Bodyworks
aromatherapy sleep lavender vanilla bath
soap it was wonderful but I would not be
purchased because I have so many so many
of the aromatherapy bath soaps luxury
bath things like that if you guys
watched my skincare collection video you
know that so I just don't feel the need
to repurchase this yet but it is very
very nice I have a really luxurious
relaxing scent another one of the
premium up enough cotton ovals from
Target a little beauty blender that has
literally chunks missing like he's super
ghetto look at him he needs to go
alright um the Rimmel glam eyes mascara
in extreme black I was super happy I
used that up I love when I use makeup up
I felt very proud of myself the caviar
anti-aging moisture intense oil cream
pre-shampoo treatment this is the only
thing from the caviar anti-aging line
that I have actually liked I'm gonna go
ahead and hold on to this and put this
on my loves list from Sephora it was
really nice it definitely like stopping
my hair up and help detangle it before I
got in the shower
alright we are getting through it
alright the Gillette Venus Olay violet
swirl this is a really really nice
shaving cream it is purple and it does
smell like violet so I do
like it and would repurchase a Pantene
pro-v root reboot dry shampoo I will
definitely repurchase this it is a dry
shampoo and hair spray in one so if that
sounds like something you would like I
definitely like it for my fine flat hair
it's really really awesome and it smells
really good I used to have to be clean
and clear makeup dissolving facial
cleansing wipes I love these these are
so good these are the oil free version
they instantly dissolve dirts oil and
makeup and even waterproof mascara I
wouldn't say they dissolve but
waterproof mascara they do dissolve like
eyeshadow and things like that but not
necessarily eyeliner and mascara however
I really really love them for removing
my face makeup they actually did an
excellent excellent job at that and I
felt like um they kind of left like a
tingling cooling sensation I'm so into
that so yes I would repurchase these I
used up the back of Body Works holiday
traditions we can have the apple
fragrance mist super cute little bottle
and it smelled great
I also used opted this makeup item well
I use it as a makeup item in skincare /
makeup this is the L'Oreal youth code
texture Perfector pore Vanisher it's got
like a silicone sort of texture to it it
is really really nice and I use that as
a primer really enjoyed that I used up
in the dug deep moisture nutriyum where
this is a nourishing body wash for
softer smoother skin this is really
really nice and I double like I doubled
it up weight and used it also yes I also
used it at hav 3 alright I used up the
 detoxifying black cleanser this
was just a little hundred-point perk
from Sephora I loved it it had actually
like be nice like warming tingling
effect on the skin and are really really
like true the impurities out of smartass
Decker I would definitely purchase a
full-sized and I've got to me love's
list on the Safari website as well
there's like a 500 things on my list
okay the DKNY be Delicious skin perfume
and this is amazing it really smells
good just like a green apple super good
and then did all right the last two
things are two little pocket bags from
method works and this one was an ice
white pomegranate this one was orchard
frost orchard Frost was fantastic it's
not like Apple I love any
apple-scented from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
this iswe pomegranate 100x our hands
again it reminded me kind of that like
twisted papperman
I mean it wasn't the same scent but this
gave me a headache and this gave me a
headache and normally if a body works
products don't give me a headache
no sense really gives me a headache I
have like a very I can tolerate it very
very well but my boyfriend was like
going to puke almost every single time I
put this on he was like he'd like to be
saying they're like like what is it babe
like what is babies like smell like I
cannot deal with a he always roll the
window down in the car um but I liked it
at first like I kind of smelled so good
and I was like yeah oh and now I just
