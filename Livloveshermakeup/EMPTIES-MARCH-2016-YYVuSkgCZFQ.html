thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having a really wonderful
day today the video is going to be a my
empties for March 2016 so if you would
like to see the beauty trash that I
accumulated over the month then please
keep on watching alright so the first
couple things I went through where baby
wipes I went through I think five or six
of these I use these in between for like
swatches and also in between while I'm
doing my makeup so yeah I went through a
bunch of these these are the Huggies I'm
sensitive like for unn sensitive the
Huggies sensitive version they have no
fragrance to them they're really really
good I love those alright the next thing
I've used up over these CeraVe makeup
removing cleanser cloths these really
really stung at my face and it's so
strange because CeraVe is supposed to be
a very very gentle brand and normally
they are very gentle on my skin however
these makeup removing wipes were just so
harsh they really stung my face they
didn't sting my eyes which is like very
strange but they stung and burnt my face
and on top of that these were like $8.99
or $9.99 very very expensive for only 25
pre-moistened Howlett so yeah I would
not repurchase alright moving on I've
used up a package of the up-and-up
premium cotton ovals that I get from
Target this is the compareto brand I
love these these are dual sided so one
side is textured and the other side is
smooth they're so easy for like you know
just taking off your makeup putting on
micellar water putting on your toner all
that kind of stuff I really really love
those I also used up this little package
right here of six papaya nectar bath
bombs I got these at Target
they are very comparable to like the
lush bath bombs they are like miniature
sized though but you get six of them for
$9.99 which i think is a great deal so
yeah I really really enjoyed these a lot
moving on I used up the Pantene 3 minute
miracle smooth and sleek deep
conditioner I've really been loving
these Pantene 3 minute miracle new light
deep conditioners because they're in a
squeezy tube they're really really well
priced and I thought that all of them
they have like different formulations
like they have a moisturizing one and
the smooth and sleek I thought all of
them were the same until I tried this
one this one is my all-time favorite so
if I do we purchase which I will I will
definitely get these smooth and sleek
version definitely my favorite I don't
know what it was it just kind of really
made my hair look nice and sleek and
shiny
all right moving on I used up a tea tree
face mask from Tony moly really really
love these they came in a dual pack I
only used one I gave the other one to my
mom but these are really really nice if
you do have inflamed skin or pimples or
acne these are lovely so really really
likes that would repurchase we went
through a decorative hand soap from Bath
and Body Works I'm pretty sure this one
was called shimmer and champagne or
something oh yeah it just felt really
really good very very nice scent I
enjoyed it I just take the label off but
I really love these decorative hand
soaps can they have super cute little
containers alright the next thing I do
stuff that I would definitely not
reprint us is the badges little intimate
washes as they wash for your downstairs
area and this one was the Oder block
technology and the reason I got the
owner block run was because I thought it
would smell better and it really did
smell good but you guys this burnt my
downstairs area so much like if I had
just gotten waxed or shaved down there
sorry if it's TMI but it would just burn
like crazy and even when I hadn't just
waxed like it's still burnt down there
so one of them first ingredients is
alcohol so yeah I don't recommend this
one
I love these summer's eve especially
their new one they have like a creamy
lather night time formula that one's
really really good highly recommended
alright moving on I've used up the Eco
tools to make up brush shampoo it says
it deeply cleanses your makeup brushes
it is hypoallergenic dermatologist
tested and free of parabens and fat
elites love this product I will
repurchase I get this for about $6.99 at
Ulta and yeah it's definitely going to
be repurchasing it really cleans all
your little SpongeBob's or your Beauty
Blender is like Real Techniques punches
really really well and also your brushes
not your blushes your brushes so I
highly recommend speaking of Beauty
blenders that this is the last one that
I am ever going to purchase I got this
not even like two months ago and
honestly it just has completely stained
I feel like it's become like misshapen
machine it's not shaped the same anymore
can you guys see that it's like all like
pointing out that way I just don't like
these anymore and I won't be
repurchasing I honestly prefer my
miracle complexion sponge is from Real
Techniques so yeah I'm not going to be
repurchasing another Beauty Blender
alright we used up the bath and
Bodyworks beautiful day deep cleansing
hand soap this is a blend of Sun
apples sparkling cassis and wild daisies
oh my god it smells so good it's like
the frettin the most fresh the freshest
the freshest scent ever you can speak
Olivia all right it is the freshest
scent ever and it's just beautiful
perfect for the springtime love it all
right I've used up the Rimmel stay matte
long-lasting pressed powder in the shade
zero zero one transparent definitely hit
pan on that one love this this is a
fantastic powder for just setting in
your makeup and stayin matte all day all
right moving on I used up the skintimate
um raspberry rain moisturizing cream
shave I do like this and I would
repurchase but I have like a seven pack
of these from Sam's Club and now I'm
just sick of it so I moved on to better
things for now all right my boyfriend
and I used up the Sarah breaths plus the
maximum strength fresh breath toothpaste
really really like this it has xylitol
in it so it's really nice if you do get
dry mouth so I think we would repurchase
that and it didn't have too spicy of a
taste which I liked alright for our like
master bathroom yes our master bathroom
we used up the bath and Bodyworks
aromatherapy Energy orange ginger hand
soap this is the boost your energy one
it has ginger essential oils and orange
it smells so good and my boyfriend loves
this soap this is his favorite one from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works so yes we will
repurchase really really lovely
and it has that makes little container
too I like that alright moving on I've
used up these suave professionals
coconut milk infusion deep moisture hair
mask this is to quickly become one of my
all-time favorite hair masks I highly
highly recommend checking this out if
you are looking for something to
moisturize your hair it doesn't have
carotene or anything that's going to
help strengthen your hair but it will
definitely put moisture back into your
hair alright the next thing I used up
was the NYX matte finish long lasting
studying spray I love this I would
definitely repurchase and use it as a
primer spray and then again after I have
completed my whole face of makeup I just
up of the belief Hungarian water essence
I really really like this I use this
after I put on my toner before I put on
my serum really really moisturizes the
skin nicely without weighing it down or
leaving oily like an oily residue on
your skin we used up the nest fragrances
woodland truffled liquid hand soap my
boyfriend loved this
I got this from him for him and so fora
I got it because he loves anything
truffle and it really smelled good like
very manly and woodsy and I just really
like the scent myself so yes we wouldn't
repurchase I used up with the pathology
exfoliate flash mask this is a flash
mask for dry skin I really like this it
was very nice
it is a sheet mask and it did fit my
face rather well so I enjoyed that
oh this decorative hand soap must have
been something else because this is the
shimmer and champagne one so this is a
decorative hand soap that we used up
really liked it the scent was very very
nice I used up another pack of the
premium cotton ovals like I said those
are my favorite I used up the bubble
bath from where is this room oh this is
the fireworks yes I'm so used to seeing
the aromatherapy container but yeah this
is the Paris aboard bubble bath from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works it is a beautiful
blend the beautiful blend of French
tulips apple blossoms and sparkling pink
champagne and it smelled really really
good I love this a lot alright and the
only fun I used up another Pantene 3
minute miracle mask this one was the
most moisture of a new one like I said
I'm more interested in these smooth and
sleek one I just like the way that it
made my hair look and feel so I would
not repurchase this one another hair
mask I would not repurchase is the
Garnier Fructis grow strong masks this
is a fortifying treatment I think this
had a lot of keratin in it and I feel
like it kind of broke my hair off so
yeah I would not be used this I don't
recommend if you're looking for
something that will just put moisture
back into here the hair I definitely
recommend checking out these SWAT
professionals want this one just look
it's more like a strengthening treatment
and yeah I did not like it it smelled
really really good though alright I used
up another pact of Huggies and then we
used up the oh snap jolly gingerbread
gentle foaming hand soap from back from
Body Works it smelled really good it
says it's not a party without the
gingerbread man that is what it looks
like and yeah it just smells like a
gingerbread cookie alright I used up in
the Tony moly pocket bunny moistness I
will be like literally just reusing this
packaging and putting in probably my
surely gross water balancing mist
because it's just so cute but yeah I
don't really like the formulation on
this I felt like it broke my skin out a
little bit
was a little heavy and oily so I would
not be purchased but I will keep the
little container alright moving on I
used up another pack of the premium
cotton ovals from the up and up brand I
also used up the Neutrogena Naturals
purifying facial cleanser it says it
gently removes impurities and improves
complexion for fresh clear skin so it
might do that I did not use this on my
face I actually use this for my makeup
brushes to clean them I did not like it
it has a little bark extract in there
which is just a fancy term for salicylic
acid which means the bristles on my
brushes feel very very yucky and crispy
and gunky so yeah I would not repurchase
alright we burned through a snowflakes
and spruce tree but candle from Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works really love this Oh smells
like a vanilla
it was a blend of snow-capped spruce and
sweetened by a touch of creamy vanilla
so yeah mostly smelled vanilla but yeah
I would repurchase next year I also
burned through this little candle in my
beauty room it was adorable I got this
in my pop sugar must-have box it smells
really good like a fancy perfume and
like a touch of sweetness just really
really liked that and yeah I am going to
go ahead and keep this little container
so I am just going to freeze this and if
you guys are curious when I I know you
guys have watched my if you have watched
my speak today if you have watched my
Beauty room tour you probably would have
seen that I like to deep pot all of my
three with candles to keep the
containers of what I do is I just freeze
them and then I chop out the wax and
then I just put them through like the
dishwasher or you can clean it by hand
and that is how you can get a little
nice container so that is what I will be
doing with this cute little candle
alright so moving on I used up a little
tub of my broth resurfacing discs I love
these these are amazing I use them as
the second part of my makeup removal at
nighttime they are just so good you can
even cut them in half if you know you
it's like a really really big disc
basically so if you don't want to use
the whole thing or if you feel like
you're wasting product you can just cut
them in half I do that a lot
alright a product that I did not
completely use that but I just have to
say goodbye to because it does not work
for me is the tom's of Maine
long-lasting natural odor protection
deodorant so this just really sucked and
I'm not into it so yeah
going to go ahead and toss that I've
used up that the elf mint maniac
exfoliating scrub as you guys can see
there is nothing left in there this was
really nice it smelled really good and
definitely exfoliated on my lips well
and then we burned through this candle
right here I took off the label because
one of our centerpieces right now on our
dining room table is a wreath and I like
to put a three-way candle in the middle
but this was called New York black-tie
it smells like a sexy ass man
it smells like my boyfriend I love it it
is scent it's the perfect date for any
night in the big city green sage
sandalwood and tonka bean YUM love that
would repurchase we have a little lick
here for a three-way candle that
probably fell off of one of those
another little lid let's see here do we
have another three with candle yes we do
we have mahogany balsam this smelled
amazing oh my god it was like a mix of
fresh balsam the fresh balsam candle and
mahogany teak wood loved it and it says
walk through holiday woods with the
aromatic fragrance of fresh green balsam
juniper berries and rich mahogany so
yeah would repurchase that next year
during the winter time this little lip
gloss right here from Smashbox it's the
lip enhancing gloss it's a beautiful
color but it has gone bad it just reeks
like it smells so freakin bad alright
we're getting to the bottom of this
little container or something to put it
on my lap I used up the lasting smiles
organic lip balm in the passion fruit
and mango scent or flavor this was
really really nice I loved it let's see
here I used up the beauty counter
cleansing balm I really like this I felt
like it removed my makeup quite well I
would not purchase a full-size I got
this in my pop sugar must-have box and I
believe Eifert like a full-size is like
$50 so it's just not worth it for me I
did go through the back of Body Works
white citrus wall flowers I have these
in the Beauty room where right now I
really really love this scent
perfect for spring I used up the in
cocoa and nail polish but this is like
those little like stamp on nail polish
things I love these these actually works
so yeah I really liked this this one was
like leopard print I used up the
chlorine dry shampoo with oat milk who
really loved this I really want to get a
full-size of this I need to put it on my
loves list at Sephora a product that I
got from Sephora that I did not
is the makeup forever instant brush
cleanser it left my like brushes just
very very oily and gross so yeah I would
not repurchase I used up that the DHC
deep cleansing oil I did like this it's
not as good as my potion makeup breakup
soul cleansing oil though so I would not
repurchase a full-size I've used up
these Sally Hansen's salon effects real
nail polish strips again these had like
a cute little sort of like fishnet
design if they do work and I did like
them another mahogany balsam 3.what
candle really really smelled good I used
up the London or lineage this is the
water sleeping mask I really enjoyed
this a lot if you have oily or
combination skin you would love this it
just leaves a beautiful satin me lick
finished on the skin and does not wait
like weight on your skin it doesn't
leave any oil or consistency or
inconsistency I've been talking too long
it does not leave any oily residue on
your skin so highly recommend I've used
up an elf tone correcting powder and
cool this is my go-to setting powder
love it I would repurchase I used up the
uber list hydrating shampoo would not
repurchase this just well it made my
hair feels so gunky and dirty it does
have royal jelly fruit extracts and
keratin in it but I don't know
I could barely lather it up on my scalp
so I really hated that would not
repurchase I've used up the Pathology
iluminates flash mask this was another
sheet mask similar to the exfoliating
one they came in the same level pack I
like this one as well I used up the Aqua
essence water fruit fluid from crumber
lab creme or lab I don't know it's a
Korean skincare brand that I found on
HauteLook I loved this I prefer it over
my Hungarian water essence from belief I
just like it better I don't know it was
a better consistency this one is really
really watery whereas the chrome or lab
one is really really thick and it still
stays like lightweight on the skin and
doesn't weigh it down but I just like
the consistency of this better if I can
find it again I will repurchase all
right I used up a little mini size of
the Peter Thomas Roth cucumber gel mask
it looks like that I did like this I
have a full size that I'm going through
I also used up a little mini one of the
24 karat gold masks this is the luxury
lift and firm I would purchase a
full-size of this alright I used to be
cleaning clear advantage three and one
exfoliating cleanser this has
5% benzoyl peroxide in it really really
liked it but I like these sister
products better which has 10% benzoyl
peroxide and no exfoliating beads the
exfoliating beads in here are really big
and chunky and they kind of irritate my
skin so I would not repurchase all right
I used up the bath &amp;amp; Bodyworks pocket
back in frosted cranberry really really
love this smells great I used up a
little sample of a bare mineral skin
longevity vital power and view it in
vivid infusion it is a serum i sense to
have purchased a full sized so loved
that i've used up the jeeva she knew our
Couture mascara it's like a four in one
product
this was nice it really just left my
lashes looking very natural and I'm not
really into natural lashes I mean today
I do have kind of natural looking lashes
but I like them with clumpy so I would
not purchase a full size alright these
little earrings here from forever 21
baroque so yeah I am tossing those they
were like $2.99 so not a big deal I used
up the Murad hydrodynamic quenching
essence I do not like this at all this
is so much worse than the Chrome or lab
one or the belief one do not get that it
has a silicone II Basin and I just don't
like that for skincare all right I used
to beat our train force of the sea
marine boosting mist again I thought
this is one of the little 500-point perk
sample things this was really nice again
it does smell very strongly of um oh I
didn't talk about the other one yet I
thought that I had talked about this one
already so anyway you can get a
500-point perk right now I actually you
don't think it's available anymore on
the sephora.com website but it was where
you could get a 500-point perk up the
new chart rainforest of the sea deep
dive cleansing gel and then the marine
boosting mess they smell very strongly
of citrus so if you have sensitive skin
I don't think you would like these I do
have combo sensitive but I'm not super
sensitive now I really really love
things that smell like very strong so I
really like these but again your skin
might not be able to handle the
fragrance and what's happen at if you
are sensitive to fragrance just like
with your nose you probably wouldn't
like these but I would consider
purchasing a full-size of both of these
I felt like the deep dive cleansing gel
was really nice it actually left a bit
of like an oily residue while I was
rubbing it in but then when I like
my face dry it was completely like it
had pulled out all of the impurities
like I was squeaky-clean so I really
liked that and then the spray was nice
as well this can be a setting spray or
just like a finishing mist when you're
done with your skincare so I would
participa sizes of those something I
would not purchase a full size of is the
Clinique turnaround daytime revitalizing
moisturizer I just did not like this
whatsoever it did not moisturize my skin
at all all right I used up the Marvis
jasmine mint this is the only harvest
toothpaste that I like and think is
worth it I love the taste and scent of
jasmine so I really do like this one I
would consider purchasing a full-size
and then the last thing that I used up
it was that the benefit whatsapp so I
did not use this up it's not that it
went bad it's just completely dried out
it's a beautiful beautiful highlight but
yeah it's like completely dried out so
that is going organize those were my
empties for March 2016 I hope you
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me and I'll see you next time
