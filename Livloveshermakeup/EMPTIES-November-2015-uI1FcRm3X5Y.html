thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a fantastic day i'm
sharing my empties with you guys for the
month and i have gone through a lot of
beauty trash yet again so let's just get
right into it i have two full bags and
yeah two big full bags so let's start
with this one the first thing I used up
were the clean and clear night relaxing
all-in-one cleansing wipes these are oil
free they're supposed to help you wind
down have a nice fragrance and they were
moved makeup I did like these like I
said they have a really nice fragrance
I'm the only thing I didn't really like
it that they are quite oily I used to
like these a lot so I guess this time I
was kind of surprised at how oily they
were they were because i don't know i
just wasn't really into it this time so
we'll see if I I'm not quite sure if I
were purchased those the next thing I
used up was the bath and body works deep
cleansing hand soap in the cranberry
citrus and sage sent this is a luscious
blend of sweet cranberry citrus zest and
a hint of sage it looks like this it
smelled really really really good oh
yeah no really really nice they smell a
lot of sage in there and a lot of
cranberries so I did like that this was
one of their like Thanksgiving kind of
late fall hand soap so I really did like
that a lot um the next thing I used up
or I bird through was this bath and body
works three wick candle in pumpkin apple
it was really really nice sweet sweet
scent I mentioned this in my favorite
fall candles video I will link that
below if you guys are interested in
watching that but it says experience the
blend of your two favorite fall stands
apple and pumpkin enhanced by notes of
cinnamon and clove so I really did like
that a lot I also burned through two of
the pumpkin pie through wick candles
they look like this this is my all-time
favorite favorite scent um for the fall
this year it was just amazing it really
really smelt like Oh pumpkin and like
pie crust and was just so so good it's a
safe room for this delicious um blend of
creamy pumpkin whipped vanilla and flaky
pie crust as sweet as your favorite
pumpkin pie so I absolutely loved those
I'm actually put these over here so I
like to depart these or have to pop them
but basically break up the wax take off
the labels and use the little jars and
for
ization purposes alright so the next
thing I used up was the one add a
woman's vitac raised woman's
multivitamins I'm really good I like
these there was super super yummy and
they taste for the goods so I wasn't
purchased I also went through my
favorite cotton ovals these are the dual
sided ones from the up-and-up brand
which is the target compared to brand
their awesome I highly recommend they
have a textured side and then a really
really soft side and they're super thick
and durable and just awesome highly
recommend I used up the swab kids Apple
detangler spray this was the dutch apple
water this smells so good and it really
really does detangle your hair without
leaving any sort of residue by the way
please excuse my hair today I'm having
kind of a poofy hair day um I used up or
at my boyfriend I used up at the meijer
cleaned a hand soap this these are
expensive these were like five dollars
apiece at whole foods by one to try them
because these were the limited
additional limited edition seasonal
sense this one is orange clove and it
really smelled good it had a lot of
orange in it and then that spicy clove
send I really enjoyed it a lot I burned
through this yankee candle this is the
autumn in the park candle this is
another one that I mentioned in my fall
favorites um fall favorite candle hmm
favorite fall candle video it's really
really good it is also a very very fresh
scent so I like that a lot of course i'm
going to do pot this one as well because
I mean look how keep that jar is its
fill it with cotton balls or something
like that and then I burned through the
bath and body works through with candle
and pumpkin pecan waffles love this it
smells so so um sweet very very sweet
and it says it is a scrumptious
delightful blend of pumpkin pecan
waffles pure maple syrup and a touch of
brown sugar I smell a lot of brown sugar
in this one so I like that a lot um
something that i will not repurchase
that I used to like and now I don't I
think it's because when i used this last
time I wasn't coloring my hair but it's
the redken all soft heavy cream this is
a super treatment for dry and brittle
hair it has argan oil in it it's
basically just a deep conditioner I used
to love the
stop it used to leave my hair feeling
like silk but now that I color it and I
do put highlights in and there's bleach
that goes on my hair like you know once
every month or so I think that it just
didn't really work for me as well it
just didn't leave my hair as soft as it
used to so yeah I would not actually
repurchase I used up the beauty
protector protect protect and condition
daily conditioner I liked this I had a
really interesting texture and it didn't
authorize my hair this is the orange
cleansing sherbert from aero aromatica
yeah I found this on hautelook it's like
a cleansing sherbert it's not really
good like orange and it was really
really thick and it basically turned
into an oil on the skin and it
completely removes your makeup so I
really really liked it if I could ever
find it again i would definitely
repurchase it was just one of those
things that was randomly on hautelook
and i picked it up so I don't know if
I'll ever find it again I used to have
two samples of the phyto exceptional
mask this is for ultra damaged brittle
and dry hair I did not like this it did
not work for me which is disappointing
because I do like the phyto brand and
normally they have very very
moisturizing products I've used up a
little small size of the bow show makeup
breakup called cleansing oil this is my
favorite thing to remove my makeup with
not my favorite thing but it's probably
the best way to remove my makeup it
takes off everything and it does not
pull up the skin or anything like that
so probably get smartest way to remove
my makeup I used up the bath and body
works deep cleansing hand soap in the
bright autumn day sent this was amazing
it smells so good it is a mix of sweet
citrus cinnamon and blonde woods ah it
smells so good I can't even explain it
if you can still find this you should
definitely pick it up it's really good
um oh my god I'm so happy I finally use
this up this is the Sephora triple
actually cleansing water this is a
micellar water I hated this and I got
like the biggest size it did have this
nice little um pump thing where you just
push on it and the product comes out
however oh it just had a very artificial
coconut smell to it I felt like it left
my skin very sticky and tacky feeling I
did not like it at all so I will not be
repurchasing I did pick up my other
favorite mind
our water which is be simple cleansing
micellar water which i absolutely love
so that's what i'm using now i did like
these birds bees cucumber and sage
facial cleansing towelettes i actually
used them to remove makeup swatches but
they were really nice for that they have
a very nice smell to them i used up
these hair skin and nail gummies with
biotin these were just okay they didn't
taste that good they are strawberry
flavored but i prefer um i'm using these
ones now which is from nature's bounty
but these are just a tiny little cute
little pink tablets let me show you guys
are actually so cute they look like
little gems can you guys see that I
thank you key I love those so I take
three of those a day and they have more
they have like argan oil more vitamins
they have horsetail hydrolyzed collagen
this one has more in it so I picked
those up instead these were just on sale
at target so I thought I'd try them I
didn't see much of a difference I'm not
going to repurchase on something I would
repurchase and I actually need to save
this bottle because my salon gives you
20 percent off if you bring back the
bottle to fill it up but this is kevin
murphy so good this is the angel mask it
is a strengthening and thickening
conditioning treatment for fine color
treated hair they sell this particular
brand at my hair salon and like i said
they will refill it and i will get 22
cut off so i'm going to take that back
to them when i see my hairstylist next
which is in a couple weeks the shiny
silver ultra color enhancing conditioner
it enhances blondes revitalizes bleach
frosted and blonde tinted hair from one
and only i would definitely repurchase
i'm going to try something else just
because i love trying new products so
i'm going to go and try a different kind
of purple conditioner but I put in a
purple conditioner after I put in my
regular conditioner I let this sit in
for probably likes it and sink in for
probably five to ten minutes and I feel
like it does make sure that it kind of
pulls out any sort of brassy tones in my
hair so I did like that I would
repurchase what I want to try something
else first alright this is kind of funny
i do not use these fuzzy downstairs area
i used these these are these summer's
eve sheer floral cleansing cloths for
sensitive skin i actually use these to
remove makeup swatches we were in target
and for some
the front of the store usually has all
the baby supplies and things like that
and i like to use baby wipes too like
while I'm doing my makeup to wipe my
hands and swatches and things like that
and they have moved everything and I did
want to go all the way to the end of the
store so I went into the women's
department and picked these up I thought
what the hell mine as well right so um
yeah they worked really well actually
and they smelled nice and they didn't
make my skin dry because they are for
that downstairs area all right another a
3-bike candle whoa whoa whoa okay the
lid just went it's that it's gone
there's nothing we can do this is the
cranberry pumpkin three wick candle from
Bath and Body Works again I mentioned
this in my favorite fall candles video
smells really nice a very very kind of
sweet but fresh it says fresh from the
patch pumpkin blends with tart cranberry
and I fragrance that brings the best
fall into your home so I really liked
this one this was kind of a newer one
this year but I really do like it so yes
I'm getting messages on my phone um
let's see here these Swiss purrs these
were the cotton squares these are sort
of comparable to the ones I showed you
guys from target but not as good so I
would not report this they are cheaper
though all right I used up the trader
joes moisturizing cream shave and honey
mango with aloe vera and vitamin E loved
this would definitely definitely
repurchase it smells heavenly and it
really really takes care of dry skin and
gives you a really close shave um I used
up the Ulta buttercream cupcake three
and one shower gel shampoo and bubble
bath these are very comparable to the
philosophy three-in-one products so if
you're looking for something like that
you could try this out oh really good
and that one smells amazing I used up
the poo pourri this is the lavender
vanilla this actually works I get these
all the time it works that's all i have
to say um I used up or we used up the
bath and Bodyworks fall lakeside breeze
deep cleansing hand soap this is a mix
of blue sage basil and sandalwood I
still thought the bright autumn day one
smelt better than this but this one came
in a closed set like second this was
very very fresh smelling as well it just
didn't smell as good as the other one um
let's see here we went through the
leaves wallflowers this is like the dual
pack refill
that here are some other little
wallflowers I don't know three random
ones who knows I think they were the
apple crumble and something else but
yeah use those up nuanced by salma hayek
I'm going to leave this out because I
want to repurchase this item right away
this is the overnight time release
retinol capsules they come like in a
little jar like this and they are
literally like these little beads that
you break open and you put it on your
face it has sort of a silicon e texture
to it and it doesn't leave you greasy
whatsoever which normally I find that
retinol leaves me a tad greasy depending
on the product so I really did like
these and I will repurchase them i think
i got those at duane reade or wall rings
or something alright another candle that
was also mentioned in my fall favorite
scandal video this is the Chesapeake Bay
candle this is the home sense in autumn
leaves it did not burn evenly as you
guys can see I loved it though I will uh
you know like deep hot I guess it's deep
on unwaxed this thing I won't d wax
those I don't know I will under this
candle i will take the wax out and i
will use the jar over because it is
really nice but you can get these at
target I love the Chesapeake Bay brand i
also used up the husk monoi coconut oil
nourishing deep conditioner this was
just okay um it is very cheap at Ulta
it's about 499 so it is a good deal I'm
not quite sure I would repurchase though
alright um the peter thomas roth
unwrinkle night cream for deep wrinkles
facial expressions night creme exclusive
patent plenty patent pending blend of
eight anti-aging peptides and
neuropeptide is a maximum strength of
twenty-four percent okay blah blah blah
blah really really good for normal to
dry skin and also those with aging skin
this is a hundred and ten dollar face
cream so if you don't want to spend the
money on it don't because you can find
things that are better elsewhere i used
up the Victoria's Secret mango
temptation um soothing smoothing soothe
a smoothing the little and just want you
guys I'm sorry I'm dropping stuff all
over the place be smoothing a body scrub
let me grab it alright this is what it
looks like so I did cut it open because
I
one of those people that does that I cut
it open so I can get all the product out
if I really really like it this is my
favorite Oh favorite Victoria's Secret
sent the mango temptation one I just
wish this came in a big tub because I
really liked the scrub it didn't leave
me I li it didn't um you know it I don't
know it just felt really good it washed
off it rinsed clean I had no oily
residue but that only lasted me to use
is on my whole body that little tiny
tubes so I wish it came in a big tub um
something that I am just passing along
or not passing along just tossing away
because I just don't want to use it up
and I'm just not into it is the polished
choice clinical scar reducing serum I'm
just not into this so I'm letting go
I've used up the pumpkin cupcake
antibacterial hand gel from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works smells amazing another Paula's
Choice product that I am passing along
just because it didn't really work for
me it's just it worked for me at one
point and then it kind of didn't work
and then it worked again and then it
didn't work it's the polished choice
clinical 1% retinol treatment it's just
a little too oily for my skin um let's
see here I used up the bi-facil Lancome
I makeup remover yeah double-action eye
makeup remover this was really nice I
liked it I would repurchase a full-size
the dermalogica active moist I am
letting this go it smells like it went
bad so yeah another thing that smells
like it went bad and my friend hailey is
going to be watching and be like no um
this is the first day beauty facial
radiance serum this did not work for me
it smells really strange all of the
first aid beauty products that i get
really smell strange like molding and
musky and very very weird and also the
color started to change so i think
there's something wrong with it so
letting it go um ok Zara randomly just a
razor down here probably shouldn't be
throwing things like that in there all
right um I used my favorite yes favorite
facial mist this is the Shirley gross
water balancing mess I love this best
facial mist ever all right um
stuff down here the buxom show off black
mascara it went you know it dried out so
I'm gonna let that go the Sephora rose
sleeping mask really liked this a lot I
would repurchase I also liked this uber
lyst hydrating conditioner it did have a
little bit of a weird texture it was
kind of slimy feeling but it did hydrate
my hair to more of East Sephora
overnight masks the green tea one this
helps with breakouts and the Pearl one
this helps for brightening the skin I
liked that as well and then one bag I
used up the Maybelline age rewind dark
circle treatment concealer I'm going to
leave this out so I remember to
repurchase right away that isn't the
brightening one I absolutely love it and
the Estee Lauder revitalizing supreme
global anti-aging creme I'm waiting for
this to come back in stock on the
sephora.com website so i can purchase a
full-size and then this little thing
this was from my hair stylist it was a
small sample of the light argan oil so i
liked that a lot i'm a repurchase that
when i see her next and i used up the
laura geller icare waterproof eyeliner
eye brightener in banana all right let's
move on to these seconds bin this one is
not or a bag this one is not as full it
looks like it is by that's because
there's a big product in here all right
the first thing in here is the honey
pineapple pumpkin deep cleansing hand
soap from Bath and Body Works this was
an interesting fragrance it smells a lot
like pineapple which is weird this time
of year again this was one of their like
Thanksgiving sort of sense but i liked
it i don't know it was different and i
liked it it was an irresistible blend of
caramelized pineapple creamy pumpkin and
molasses so yeah it was interesting my
boyfriend used up the olay ultra
moisture with shea butter body wash he
loves this he repurchases this all the
time it really does smell good yeah it
smells like typical olay like body
washes yeah it really does smell nice
but I just wish you try different things
I could never just you know repurchase
the same thing over and over and over
and over again I used up the alley
simply fiber for digestive regularity
yes these are good I like these little
fiber ones these taste like green apple
yummy this big thing we used up these
are the tide pods free and gentle free
of dyes and perfumes these are laundry
detergent pods I like them because they
don't um mix and mingle any kind of they
don't put in any extra cent with the
scent boosters that I already put in my
wash I'm a boyfriend likes them because
they are free and clear of any dice or
perfumes he is sensitive to that kind of
stuff so we love those I've used up
these simple micellar cleansing wipes
these are awesome you guys these are
amazing these really really great for
removing makeup they don't have that
typical kind of soft texture that the
other simple wipes have they have a
little bit of a thinner texture and
they're a little more abrasive a little
more textured i would say however they
really really hydrate the skin you can
actually feel the moisture on your skin
after so these are great also to use in
the morning if you want just to cleanse
your face if you're in a hurry all right
here this is better than just throwing
in random razors I went through a
three-putt three pack three plac mmm
three pack of the gillette venus
sensitive disposable razors these were
really nice i liked them a lot i'll be
throwing those things in instead of
random razors here and there so i don't
sliced my hand open i used up a pumpkin
cupcake or burnt through the pumpkin
cupcake from mmm bath and body works
this is a 3 wick one again and this says
satisfy your sweet tooth with the scent
of a freshly baked pumpkin cupcake
covered in loads of rich buttercream
frosting yeah I want to eat that right
now right now alright another candle
active Apple pumpkin pancakes this
smells a lot like maple syrup yeah so if
you like that Center would probably
really like that one um another one
pumpkin pie like I said this was my
favorite this year so oh I love it it's
so good just to bits to it and another
really good one was the citroÃ«n cedar
wood this is kind of one of those like
if you like mahogany teak wood and like
a New York black tie those kind of manly
sense you would like this one it really
smells like a sexy net all right moving
on
we're almost done guys I used up the
bath and Bodyworks brandied apple pear
deep cleansing hand soap it is a harvest
blend of sweet branding apple and juicy
pear and it smells so good this was my
favorite one of the month that we went
through we had in the kitchen smell so
good it really smells like just a mix of
apple and pear and it's delicious love
it alright I used up the dr jart
clearing solution ultrafine microfiber
sheet mask it has double Cilic acid and
tea tree oil in it I like to this it
really fit my face well I didn't have
any issues with it and I did like what
it did for my skin overnight you put it
on you leave it on for about 15 to 20
minutes and rub the excess skin like I
used up the Clinique this is the take
the day off cleansing balm this was just
okay I don't know it wasn't anything
special I used up the macadamia
moisturizing rinse this is a conditioner
it was okay ah I loved this this was the
co bigelow number 14 11 meant a body
vitamin body wash with one percent no
one point nine percent peppermint oil
this was amazing i love the smell of
peppermint if you don't like mint or
pepper n you'd hate this but it really
kind of tingles and like awakens your
body in your mind and your nose in the
morning so i really really liked that a
lot yes I would repurchase another tea
cleansing ham so this was also another
one of those what did it what was it
called thanksgiving like I don't know
their Thanksgiving ones this is called
gift thanks but it's their sweet
cinnamon pumpkin one which is just like
the normal fall thing that comes out
every year really good sense not my
favorite I just picked it up because it
had like the different packaging I
thought it was cute and we had in the
kitchen it is an enticing blend of
creamy pumpkin cinnamon and spiced sugar
but it was good
and then we have a lid for one of these
three wick candles so all right guys
that was it thank you for joining me and
going through all of this trash this
beauty trash I'm excited to take this
right on out to the recycling and I hope
you guys enjoyed this I know there were
a lot of candles I really really have a
sick Campbell obsession and it doesn't
help that i just ordered a bunch more
from Bath and Body Works so yes there
will be a Bath &amp;amp; Body Works haul coming
up soon but anyway I hope you guys
