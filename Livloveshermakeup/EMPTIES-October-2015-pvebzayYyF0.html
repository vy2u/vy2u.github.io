thank you so much for joining me as
promised i have my empties for the month
for you guys today so i have them in
this big old trader joes bag i have a
lot of stuff to go through i have two
bags on the floor next to me once
recycling one is garbage everything will
go in there according to what it is
that's in the bag so um hold on one sec
I'm ticked over um but yes this is going
to be october 2015 empty so let's just
get started and i will show you guys
what I just up this month sorry I'm
having some trader joes bag issues on
the floor here all right the first thing
I used up were three bags of these happy
wipes that these were just the normal
scented ones i prefer the ones that
smell like green tea but these are
really multi-purpose and i use them to
clean my hands while i'm doing my makeup
i use them if i have fallout i use them
for a lot of different things so i go
through a lot of those quite often
alright the next thing I went through
was a little duo kit of the bath and
Bodyworks home apple crumble wallflowers
we have these in our living room right
now we have two little wild flowers turn
you guys there's like some kind of hair
it's like poking around I can feel it
like right in my right in front of my
face and I don't know where it is I
can't yeah I think I got it anyway um
yeah we have these right now that are
plugged into the wall this apple crumble
scent is absolutely amazing if you've
never smelled this you should I wish
they would still make this like ave
three wick candle they don't anymore
sometimes bath and body works does bring
back certain sense but unfortunately
they happen with that one but it smells
really really good I used up a it's a 10
miracle hair mask this um detangles
restores moisture balance instantly
restores elasticity it softens it
smooths it imparts luminous shine
enhances natural body nourishes d
frizzes and improves color vibrancy so
does a lot of things and its really
really good i got two of these on sale
at target i believe for like 20 699 so
really really good deal I love that
product um this candle I burn through
this is from the collection by
chesapeake bay this is the tobacco cedar
candle I just burned through the last
little bit of this last night i love
this if you saw my fall favorite or my
favorite fall candles video you would
have seen this candle
in there it smells so good it's very
very woodsy um you could definitely say
kind of smells like a bonfire that's how
I'm going to explain it so I really
really like that um the other candle I
used up was the three wood candle from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works in leaves the smells
amazing another one that was in my
favorite fall candles video it is a
blend of golden nectar red apple and
spice berries it just kind of speaks for
itself it smells really really good I
used up a little limited-edition
limited-edition sensitive skin wet one
sensitive skin hand wipes I have no idea
why these were limited edition but these
were just ok I use these when I didn't
have baby wipes but honestly they did
dry my hands out a bit when i was doing
swatches or if i needed to like you know
run it underneath my face for Fallout
and stuff like they can't really do
those with like antibacterial wipes like
that she probably do those with baby
wipes so I did not like those that much
I used up the philosophy just released
me dual phase oil-free eye makeup
remover it still is really really oily
even though it doesn't have oil in it
they claim but it does get the job done
all you do is just put a little on a
cotton pad and it should remove the
majority of makeup it does help with
waterproof mascara as well so I did like
that I would repurchase um this is
another product i would definitely
repurchase the downy unstoppables in
wash scent boosters and this is my
favorite scent this is the lush sent
it's the purple one it smells so good
it's a very like calming kind of
lavender scent I use this on my clothes
my boyfriend does not um he's kind of
sensitive to scent but i love this mixed
in with my laundry it just makes your
laundry smell really really fresh good
um we used up a pumpkin pecan waffles
deep cleansing hand soap the smell
amazing it is a mix of fluffy waffles
sugared pecans and maple syrup I'm
pretty sure that's just self-explanatory
it smells so good you just want to eat
it all right um I used up the body shops
tea tree skin clearing facial wash that
is this told me forever to go through
you guys I picked this up I think last
year around this time when I was
visiting Milwaukee when I didn't even
live here at Ulta and it has lasted
forever if you really want a cleanser
that's going to last forever go ahead
and pick yourself something that is like
a gel because gels go on forever and
ever and of course I like to
different products so I did change it up
quite often maybe that's why it lasted
me so long but really really good it
smells very strongly a tea tree so if
you don't my teacher you won't like that
one but it does help to clear up any
blemishes on your face I used up these
cinema secrets makeup brush cleaner this
is quick drying and a rinse free formula
I got this at sephora I'm not super
impressed it did it does make your
brushes smell like cupcakes which is
kind of awesome but at the same time it
doesn't really remove everything
especially from like my foundation
brushes and things like that so I don't
think I would repurchase I am on the
hunt for a really good like quick drying
instant makeup or instant brush cleaner
if you have one in mind please leave it
below let me know what it is alright i
used up the bath and body works three
with candle in brown sugar allspice this
was actually one that i didn't like that
much i liked it when I first smelled it
and I just thought oh brown sugar
allspice I'll like that but honestly
after a while gave me a bit of a
headache the sentence so this is a
balance of sparkling brown sugar
crystals and freshly ground allspice I
think it was the allspice that kind of
gave me a headache it was just too
strong for me all right I burnt up
another candle this is my favorite
candle that is like I don't know my
favorite fall Campbell if I had to pick
one this is it this is the pumpkin pie
three wood candle from Bath and Body
Works this is a delicious blend of
creamy pumpkin whipped vanilla and flaky
pie crust that's as sweet as your
favorite pumpkin pie it smells amazing I
have one of these burning in my beauty
room right now too so yes I'm purchased
I love yes all right I went through the
up and up strand which is the targets
compared to cotton oval dual-sided
little like oval sauce it's like for our
pine toner and things like that these
are my all time favorite they're super
thick one side is exfoliating and the
other side of soft I really really love
those all right I used up the other it's
a 10 miracle hair mask like I said those
came in a little dual pack from target
um I used up these Ali restful sleep for
a healthy sleep cycle melatonin else I
mean and botanical gummy choose this is
supposed to help you sleep at night a
lot of people ask me I mentioned quite a
lot that I
kind of bad insomnia and a lot of people
ask what I take because I know that that
is a common issue with a lot of people
so I like to change it up but I did try
out this brand this Ollie brand this is
new at Target and I did really like
these they taste like blackberry you
just chew to at nighttime and you do get
three milligrams of melatonin nailing in
there you get chamomile passion fruit
extract and lemon balm which helps like
calm down any kind of anxiety you may
have and the reason I can't sleep at
night personally is because my brain
just starts kind of like going off I get
very very hyper so that's the reason I
can't sleep at night so if you do have
that kind of issue it's not just like
you you just don't you know you have
like trouble like staying asleep that's
not what I have I just have an issue
falling asleep once i'm asleep i can
actually sleep throughout the whole
night usually um but these are really
nice I am trying something else right
now and I will let you guys know how
those go as well oh we're pretty good I
would repurchase um again I went through
a few of these Purell sanitizing wipes
um when I didn't have baby wipes on me
wouldn't really recommend they do dry
you out like they will dry your hands
out and if you're doing swatches they
will dry you out so I don't recommend
that for makeup removal but for keeping
your hands clean I do alright another
product that keeps your hand please your
hands clean this is the bath and
Bodyworks maple sugar kiss deep
cleansing hand soap this is a mix of
brown sugar vanilla and maple oh it
smells really really good um where do we
have this right now I think we had this
in my I think the guest bathroom yeah
this was in the guest bathroom it
smelled really really really good ah I
would repurchase all right I went
through a oh I get asked about this a
lot too so people ask me all the time
what kind of vitamins I taken things
like that because I do mention that i
take like hair skin and nail vitamins
and whatnot i also take omega-3 this was
just a little ah this is actually
prescription so i am going to block off
my name and address right there but
these are the omega-3 ethyl esters these
are one gram per serving and i take four
of these a day so four grams of omegas
the reason I started making it was
because my triglycerides were high out
there now normalized now
my doctor said I could go off them but I
asked to stay on them because I noticed
a big difference in my nails my skin my
hair all sorts of things like that when
I take those so I like those a lot um I
went through these miraculous
moisturizing hand gloves these were
something that i found on hautelook and
i absolutely loved these I don't even
know what the brand is because I ripped
it off at the top that these were so
nice they had cocoa butter and vitamin E
in them and they voice in and heal your
hands and it was amazing so if you ever
see something like this pick these up
there so good all right moving on I used
up the Real Techniques deep cleansing
gel if you guys watched my review on
this I don't use it really on my brushes
anymore i actually just use it on my
beauty sponges it cleans beauty blenders
and the Real Techniques sponge is so so
well I've already be purchased and it
should be here shortly so I absolutely
love that I used up a dove dry spray
this is the coolest central's one this
is one of those deodorant sprays that
you just like spray underneath in your
armpit and this one smelt really good
smell like cucumber and it was really
nice i like these lockers they don't
leave white marks and they don't feel
sticky so i use these a lot I've got
another one right now that's the one I'm
using is called nourished beauty it's
the same one it's from dove but it's
just the nourish baby sent so really
really like those have repurchased
alright we went through a crisp morning
air deep cleansing hand soap we had this
at the kitchen sink really cute little
packaging there but this is a mix of
pine juniper and a hint of pear oh it
smells so fresh if you like those fall
scents that are very fresh not too sweet
or woodsy you would really really like
this crisp morning air one smells really
really good alright so we went through a
toothpaste this is the Thera breath plus
maximum strength fresh breath toothpaste
this doesn't really taste like anything
it's kind of weird but it does keep your
mouth really like clean feeling I don't
know how to explain it but it's kind of
nice ah the only thing I look for in
toothpaste is that they normally just
like taste good and this one really
doesn't have day so it doesn't really
matter but um we went through I think
two of these so yeah we really like
those all right
um I used up the bikini zone anti bump
shave gel for the bikini area this bites
bumps an irritation for smooth skin you
can use this anywhere you can use this
down there you can use it on your
armpits anywhere where you're sensitive
when you're shaving or waxing and it
works really really well so I did like
this it's like a cool hydrating like
blue cooling gel it feels really really
good i used it on my armpits too when I
was shaving because i always get razor
burn there stop I went through a pack of
the aveeno active natural ultra calming
makeup removing wipes they gently sooth
and cleanse removing dirt and makeup
even mascara I love disease these works
so well if you guys are looking for a
good eye makeup or I'm makeup remover
and face makeup remover um that is in
like you know this format like a white
perform at this is really really good
these of you know ones are really good
they smell awesome too highly recommend
I used to have a Sephora jelly mask this
is the moisturizing and energizing one
it comes in this little like mono mono
tube and I actually put this in the
refrigerator and then put it on my face
which was like whoa that really really
woke me up so you can do that and I
loved that I have more of those to go
through I used up this tiny little
Pantene pro-v nature fusion smooth
vitality shampoo I used this to deep
cleanse my makeup brushes and we got
those just from staying in hotels I take
all of those shampoos every day when
they put them in I just like steal them
that's just what I do i use them for
other things and they clean makeup brush
was really well alright i used up this
little tiny a sense of luxury hand soap
in rosemary mint with pure essential
oils i liked this a lot and you know
what i think that the bodywork should
create they have their like aromatherapy
line they really should do a rosemary
mint scent because honestly rosemary
mint is very therapeutic it smells so
good and i love the combination of those
two together um I used to be kevin
murphy untangled leave-in conditioner
detangler i get this from my salon and i
really really liked this it definitely
does put moisture back in your hair so
you want to make sure if you have fine
hair like I do you don't spray too much
on your roots but overall this was a
really good product I really liked that
a lot I would definitely
purchase I used up another one of the
tiny little Pantene shampoo is this was
the classic care solutions use this to
deep clean my brushes it worked I used
up the Estee Lauder enlightened dark
spot correcting night serum I liked this
a lot it smelled really really good and
had a nice texture so i will consider
purchasing a full size of that my
boyfriend used up the nuance by salma
hayek anti-aging super cream and he just
used this because it was a tiny tiny
little like tub and he was out of town a
lot lately so he brought that when he
traveled and he said he liked it so
alright um we ghost up this bergamot 22
lalab o soap oh my gosh it smells so
good it smells like the ec miyake I'm
Cologne if your boyfriend or your
significant other where's that Cologne
you'd really like this that so if they
just a bar of soap it smells awesome I
would definitely repurchase um let's see
here they shook intuition pure
nourishment moisturizing ribbons coconut
milk and almond oil cartridges these are
refills for the Schick intuition love
these they smell really really good you
guys know i alternate between getting
razor head refills for this and just
shaving my legs with a normal oops sorry
guys just hit the camera and shaving my
legs with a normal razor because these
are super super expensive but i do love
my ship intuition razor and here's the
other razor that i had used this is like
a man's razor huh but guys razors have
literally like 10 more blades than a
woman's razor does usually women's
razors have like two to three blades
whereas guys have like five to seven
seriously so highly recommend doing that
if you want to get a really really close
shave alright i used up the revlon
age-defying powder in 05 light i'm
always so happy when i use up makeup yes
go me look at that totally alright and
let's see here my boyfriend and I kind
of shared this is it the essay letter
advanced night repair synchronize
recovery complex I got a big to like tub
of this last year and he also got this
one and it seemed like he wasn't
think it very often lately so I finished
it off for him I hope he doesn't mind
all right um the Sephora express I
makeup remover wipes this was nice I
like this I got this in like a little
sample deck from Sephora they work free
well they're kind of small boat but
definitely if you're traveling those
would work well I used up a sample of
the UM what's this brand called against
open glory six and one super serum plus
moisture really really love this i am
going to definitely think about getting
a full side of this product cuz i really
really did like that it was very very
moisturizing our skin and the last thing
that I used up was the fresh black th
delay I concentrate this was a hundred
point perk from Sephora you guys this
lasted me forever but this is one of the
best eye creams ever it smells like
black tea I actually see a visible
difference in like creasing and things
like that when I wear this at night when
you know the next day when I put my
makeup on a visible difference a lot
more moisture in the area it's awesome
awesome awesome highly recommend super
expensive but highly recommend alright
nice so that was my empties video for
the month of october i hope you guys

next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
