channel today's video is going to be my
empties for the month so if you would
like to see what Tom and I used up then
please keep on watching so the first
item is something I would definitely
repurchase once I go through my healthy
deodorants from la vanilla this is the
tarte clean queen of vegan deodorant and
when i say that i use this up i mean i
used it up but even scraped it out of
the bottom so i love this i think it's a
beautiful beautiful deodorant really
nice scent it is aluminum free and
natural which is awesome and it is
obviously vegan um like i said my only
complaint is the fact that i went
through this very very quickly but it's
a good product and i would repurchase
alright next we have the benefit Air
Patrol BB eyelid primer again something
that I wish I could repurchase it's a
beautiful eye primer really like that
it's not too sticky on the actual
eyelids but unfortunately benefit tests
on animals so I'm not going to
repurchase alright we did go through
some Campbell's from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
the first one is fresh balsam it smells
like a Christmas tree smells really
really good and we would probably
repurchase here is tis the season my
favorite scent I'm gonna go ahead and
decanter this little container as well
it smells really really good
this one is a blend of let's see here a
Red Delicious apple sweet cinnamon bark
and a cedar wood and if you guys are
curious I did recently have another
discussion with Bath and Body Works they
actually called me on the phone and from
what I understand now they are cruelty
free I know that like the past couple
empties videos I've been saying I'm not
purchasing from them I don't know what's
going on I can't get a clear distinct
yes or no but I now feel comfortable so
I will go ahead and start purchasing
from them again these are all leftovers
from the past like three or four months
I have not purchased from them in a
while but this guy right here is winter
this is a blend of white woods pine
eagle sparkling Clementine and spice
clove it smells like cold but when
you actually like light it up it smells
really good and then another like I said
it is the season alright next I did you
thought the Garnier skin acted micellar
cleansing water I'll go ahead and throw
up in the cards my video on the Battle
of the my stellar waters this is a very
good product but Garnier does test on
animals so I will not be repurchasing my
favorite one is from simple and they are
cruelty free so yeah would not
repurchase that if you do have more dry
skin and you do want to try the Garnier
the pink ones better for those of you
with combo to oily skin the blue ones
really good if you have dry skin all
right Tom you stuff these sleep tight
pharmacy for midnight balm a full-size
he got through his quicker than I got
through mine he did like this he felt
like it left his skin a little bit
the oily side so we're not going to
repurchase for him during the summertime
he really likes using the belief true
aqua balm during the summer but this is
something that he did enjoy during the
winter time next we have the Bath and
Body Works aromatherapy sleep nighttime
tea body wash and foam bath it has a
cedar wood or cedar wood and orange
essential oils that help calm in comfort
like bedtime tea and it smells really
really good at honestly smells like tea
I'm a huge tea drinker so yeah this is
definitely something I would repurchase
I have come to find that I really
appreciate and love the aromatherapy
line a lot more than the regular line
from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works so you know like
their body products so this is what I
will be purchasing from I did use up two
bottles of these summer's eve nighttime
cleansing wash and Island Splash
cleansing wash I used to use these on my
you know my little downstairs area but
I'm not going to anymore I believe they
test on animals and on top of that tom
told me as a doctor you should just go
ahead and wash with regular soap down
there so I don't know maybe these do
actually throw off the pH after a while
so I like them they smell good but would
not repurchase next we do have the dirty
hydrating night creme so these are 100%
cruelty free I believe this is a hundred
percent vegan - yeah paraben free
cruelty free 100% vegan this was a
really nice and night cream if you want
something very similar to like the
Cetaphil moisturizing not like the same
texture but it will give you the same
sort of like I don't know the same sort
of thing that happens at the end like
you want the same amount of moisture I
would go with the derm e it's really
beautiful it kind of smells like
bubblegum to me if you are sensitive to
fragrance I'd go with the Cetaphil but
this is a nice option so if you are like
wearing retinols at night or AAS this is
something you can go in with and it's
not going to disturb that so I did like
that I would purchase a full-size
alright next we have the next cleansing
oil this is the stripped off cleansing
oil
I gave one of them to Tom's on - this is
not something I'm really interested in
it is a good deal I got buy one get one
50% off during the altar 21 days of
beauty events but it is highly highly
fragrance and I noticed that my skin did
not like that so would not repurchase
next we have oh my god these are
literally going to go into a fails video
because they were such a such a big fail
this is the Clinique pep starts quick
clip quick cleansing swipes there were
like 4 or 5 in here and basically as you
guys can see on the back it's like this
little cleansing swipe that when you
push it like lifts itself out I bought
these forever ago to take on a trip and
I never
to use them and they literally are so
dry it's really cute watching the thing
come out but that's it they're very very
expensive so horrible on the skin they
are filled with alcohol you can just
smell it and like the first ingredient
it's literally alcohol after water water
and alcohol but yeah these were very
irritating on my skin would not
recommend these do not purchase these
you guys seriously if you like sensitive
skin you're going to hate these though I
did not like those at all they also were
super super dry and I like for like a
cloth to be nice and moist if I'm
removing swatches or face makeup alright
next we have the dry bard detox dry
shampoo I have like a love-hate
relationship with this I love it because
it does remove all the oil but I hate it
because it turns my hair gray not that I
really care to be completely honest if
people think I have gray hair which I
don't yet but um it's just one of those
things where sometimes I notice it gets
a little tacky in my hair and it makes
it harder for me to wash my hair I
already have a hard time washing my hair
since I do have a scar on the back of my
scalp from a recent scalp surgery
because of my lupus so I don't know if I
would repurchase like I said love or
hate relationship next we do have the it
cosmetics bye bye pores poreless finish
airbrush powder in translucent this used
to be my favorite like buffing technique
or um this was the powder I would use
with the buffing technique my favorite
finishing powder it no longer is I
really do prefer the by Terry hyaluronic
powder or the elf one is still really
good so if you want a good silica or
finishing powder you can go ahead and
pick this up just you know this does
have the tiniest amount of a yellow tint
and I am very very fair complected and
honestly that is something that actually
does turn my skin a little yellow when I
met my fairest so I just want to let you
know so I would not repurchase just
because there are better deals out there
next we have the pharmacy rise and shine
daily moisture locked ami used this up
he said he liked it but when I tried it
it was super super slimy so not
something that we would repurchase from
pharmacy I did not like that
alright next Tom did use up the crew
pomade this is a medium hold and high
shine sort of like you know it's like a
a gel but you know like a wax that you
put in your hair it smells really good
but I don't actually like this in his
hair I feel like it weighs his hair down
but he seems to like it it holds up his
hair he does have more coarse Asian hair
and he does seem to like it so yeah that
is something that he would probably
repurchase next we do have the urban
decay subversion thicker longer stronger
lash primer this within my project pan
which I will be updating you guys on
soon and yeah you
that up love this would repurchase the
best lash primer out there and it is
cruelty free next we have beeps dry
shampoo this is another really nice one
it just doesn't absorb oil the way the
detox dry shampoo does but I would
possibly repurchase is by taste I'm
sorry the brand do they test on animals
also batiste let me know down below I
need to do some research next we have
the ponds clarence b3 dark spot
correcting cream my friend Rochelle gave
this to me she is dry skin it did not
hydrate enough for her I finished it off
and honestly would not repurchase
because of the fragrance normally I can
handle a lot of fragrance but this was
too much so yeah did not like that
I did finish off the Mario Badescu
facial spray with aloe cucumber and
green tea again purchase this about a
month ago when I purchased the Tarte
clean queen a vegan deodorant so I go
through this and deodorant pretty darn
quickly and but especially that vegan
one that was crazy
oh yeah I really like this a lot you
guys I feel like I can layer this
throughout the day on at my face I will
purchase repurchase this one as well as
the Rose one but I have to say you know
Rose is known to if you put a lot on
kind of semi irritate the skin I would
recommend this one if you're a little
more sensitive it does not smell like
cucumber it just smells like green tea
and I really do like it so would
repurchase here is the essence all about
Matt fixing contact powder I pan these
practically like every two weeks would
repurchase here is the bath and
Bodyworks twisted peppermint
antibacterial hand gel I hate that I
can't get the little you know a mount
out at the bottom it drives me nuts but
this is a nice scent and I would
repurchase I did use up let's see here
this little guy right here the Tarte
rainforest of the sea marine boosting
mist not my favorite facial spray very
very citrusy and I'm talking like
grapefruit like sour kind of scent if
you don't like that you would not like
this but I don't feel like it
moisturizes the way of my merry Badescu
ones do so would not repurchase that
here we have two of the little mini
Lancome advances genifique
youth activating treatments these are
serums and I have gone through five or
six full sizes of these when I was in
college and they were my go-to serum I
think that they work but it's not
something that I would recommend to you
guys it's not anything dramatic or
amazing there are much better serums on
the market and there are much better
cruelty free serums on the market
all right next I did use up the tis the
season Wallflower pack like I said tis
the season is my favorite wintertime
scent I know we're basically into summer
but like I said I have not purchased
from Bab my body works in over four
months so these were the sense that we
had around
yeah really like this had The
Wallflowers in the beauty room I can
still smell it now here is the talika
photo hydrogen a specific hydration gel
this is a very very interesting product
I liked it a lot it reminded me like a
lot like a lot they reminded me a lot of
thee what is it called Neutrogena
hydraboost water gel which is really
nice if you comp or oily skin but it
says right here much more than a
moisturizer photo hydra date is the
first cream that actually uses the
energy from the light to intensely
moisturize the skin I feel like that's
like saying people go sit in the Sun or
go like sit you know in light I don't
know I don't know houses I don't know
about like the actual claim but it was a
nice hydration kind of product it does
have a little bit of like a perfume eat
scent to it so if you don't like that
you would not like this but I could see
myself purchasing a full-size that they
are cruelty free next we have the Tarte
skincare pack your bags 911 I rescued
patches did not like these like I said
for the most part I really do enjoy
Tarte skin here but these did absolutely
nothing so would not purchase those Tom
used up the body shop special edition
blueberry body butter he used this on
his face you guys he came in the other
day he goes so I finished off my my
other face cream I said what other face
cream like what are you talking about
you're using the believe aqua balm and
he goes oh the blueberry one I was like
that's why your face has been smelling
so good
and I was like you used a body butter on
your face and he was like oh I just
thought it was a big face cream and he
was like is that why I've been breaking
out I was like yeah that's why you've
been breaking out so anyway it was a
beautiful scent it took him a long time
to obviously get through this he did get
breakouts from it use that on your body
probably would not repurchase I think
the body shop tests on animals but I'm
not 100% sure let me know down below and
finally I did use up the Peter Thomas
Roth pumpkin enzyme mask one of my
all-time favorite mascot I will not
repurchase Peter Thomas Roth does tests
on animals and I heard it that the Anna
Lou Naturals has like a glycolic honey
like dupe for this so that is what I'm
going to get so anyway guys those are my
empties for the month let me know down
below what was your top 5 products that
used up and your bottom 5 and I guess I
will see you guys tomorrow fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
