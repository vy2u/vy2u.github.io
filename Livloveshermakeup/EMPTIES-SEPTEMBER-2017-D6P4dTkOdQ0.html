my channel thank you so much for joining
me happy Monday today I wanted to share
with you guys my September 2017 empties
now originally this was not the video I
had planned to film today but
unfortunately I woke up late and this
was just a very simplistic and easy
video to film so that's the one we're
going with before I have to head to work
but yeah let's go ahead and jump right
into it so the first two items I used up
here are ones that are impractical II
every single empties video I have not
repurchased this three times and this is
turning into like one of my most
repurchase skincare products it is from
drunk elephant it's the best he can to
love jelly cleanser I love this and now
that I'm down here in Arizona I think
this is absolutely fantastic if you do
have more normal to dry skin it is very
very expensive so I can understand
people don't want to justify the price
on this but it's working wonders for me
and I will continue to repurchase and
then I did go through for a different
essence all about Matt fixing compact
powders so I thought I would show you
one of them I pay on these all at the
time but this is what I actually have on
my skin today just that in my whole
entire face a foundation of course a
different one I recently purchased tea
with new ones from Ulta but these retail
for 399 I feel like they work for all
sorts of different skin types to set in
at your foundation or just to touch up
for kind of like oil control throughout
the day I do want to say if you have a
deeper complexion this might look a
little actually on you it definitely
does give a little bit of a white
appearance on the skin I have to use a
lighter hand now that I am self-tans but
it's a fantastic powder and for 399 you
really can't beat the price so I
definitely would repurchase alright up
next we have the first all the unicorn
essence this is a skin enhancing
antioxidant serum you guys have probably
seen this all over Instagram it was
definitely one of those products that I
wasn't gonna purchase because I felt
like it was so overhyped however I
actually like this I don't like it as a
serum I do not feel like the ingredients
are good enough to be like a good skin
serum however I will say this makes very
really really great face primer
especially if you do have more combo to
oily skin this was like a go-to for me
when I was living in Milwaukee I finish
it off down here I would consider be
purchasing what I like to do is
basically take a full dropper full of it
I apply it to my face and then
immediately go in with my foundation at
least
like a sticky tacky consistency so your
foundation really adheres to it all day
long like I said not good enough
ingredients to be an actual skin care
product however it does make for a
pretty good primer so I would possibly
repurchase all right up next I actually
used up one of my Becca at lush a lip
color balms this has been like my go-to
all month long this is a new shade she
creme
I did a little bit of a review on these
I will go ahead and throw it up in the
cards for you guys I'm gonna go ahead
and do a lip brush in there and get the
rest out but this has been like my
perfect cool toned nude color I love
this shade now I do feel like these are
a little overpriced for what you get but
I do think I would repurchase just
because this is obviously something I've
really been enjoying so and yet that
isn't he beckoned left left lip color
balm in the shade a chai creme alright
up next we have a skincare product that
my boyfriend actually finished off for
me this is the charger reinforce of the
sea marine boosting mist and this
definitely left a little bit of a skin
reaction on my skin personally so if
this isn't you know go from me but he
definitely liked it he brought it to the
gym with him and would like touch up on
his face I thought that was very cute
because he's so manly and for him to
have a little purple and blue bottle and
his gym bag was kind of cute but anyway
he said he did like it but he doesn't
want me to purchase a full-size for him
alright - moving on guys I have the
comforter shower cream here from lush
and this says wash away your worries
with the reassuring black currant sensor
it's a cuddle in a bottle I love the
scent of the comforter so it's basically
like a wrapper Ian black berry creme
scent however I hated the consistency on
this it was very very slimy and I have
noticed lately now I am actually very
picky when it comes to shower gels and
creams it has to be the perfect
consistency or I feel very strange I
know it's very very nitpicky but this
was not for me you also get an extremely
small amount of product here for the
price so I would not be purchased all
right up next I have a product yield
that was sent to me for PR it's the 100%
pure cucumber cheese cleanser for
sensitive skin it is 100% natural as
well as a hundred percent of vegan this
is not something I would purchase with
my own money nor would I recommend to
you guys I felt like the cucumber scent
was very very overwhelming it did have a
nice pump right here I like the amount
of product that you get in here but he's
a little more on the expensive side it
definitely didn't do much and I don't
feel like it was anything special so I
would not recommend and would not
repurchase all right up next we have a
product here that my scent
friendís sent me it is called detergent
for puff and sponge
it's from the dye so Japan brand I do
not believe that this is cruelty free so
I would not repurchase that I cleaned my
brushes amazingly and it really does
clean sponges really nicely so and that
is that product right there moving on
let's go ahead and get into some back
hair items so of course you guys know
I've been obsessed with lush lately so
the first guy I have here is a comforter
bar and this was basically just a bubble
bar that was the comfort or scent so I
really do enjoy that one and then up
next we have the blue skies and fluffy
white clouds is also a bubble bar this
one smells really really good kind of
has like a patchouli scent so if you
like more fresh scent you enjoy back
here we have bright side which is a
little more like a citrus orange scent
really you enjoy that one would
repurchase I would repurchase all of
these rosary on bubble room absolutely
would repurchase and then here we have
the candy a bubble bar which is kind of
similar to comforter but a little more
sweet so obviously would repurchase that
as well I just love the bubble bars I do
like their bath bombs they're not as bad
as I thought they were
I'm not a used to be on a bath bombs I
just like something that's going to be a
little more moisturizing on my skin the
bubble rooms definitely have some more
on essential oils infused in there so if
you're looking for moisturization on
your body would highly recommend those
but the comforter bubble bar and just
bright side and stuff like that make
wonderful luxurious bubbles in your bath
and they are all natural so would
repurchase all of those
alright guys then finally I have a
little bit of home empties here just
some candles that I want to share with
you guys the first one it's from
Pacifica this is the Tuscan blood orange
handle it smells amazing
and I definitely would repurchase now I
know a lot of people were saying that
these single week candles right here
really do not give a lot of scent throw
I definitely have to burn two or three
of these at a time to really smell them
in the apartment but then this scent was
really really good would repurchase you
can see there's a lot of stuff that
build-up here built up here but I don't
really mind that that's okay
it was only towards the end of the
candle and then right here we have
Hawaiian Ruby guava now this one was
kind of similar to the Tuscan blood
orange however this one I felt like
kinda gave me a headache I could only
burn this one by itself and I can take a
lot of sense so I thought that was kind
of interesting probably would not
repurchase that one here we have the
witch City wicks sea mist oh my god I
did not like the
scent of this candle right here I will
go ahead and decamp these candles since
these are beautiful little glass
containers see with the Pacifica but ooh
yeah this was very like a baby powder
resented and I'm not a fan of that so
for me personally would not repurchase
Themis from which City wicks but these
are all really really wonderful candles
cruelty-free they're vegan elec free
wicks a good good good non-toxic and
then finally we have me which city wicks
a honey lemon candle not this one I also
have a little bit of like a baby powder
undertone but it wasn't too aggressive
or in-your-face I'm not a huge fan of
like that baby powder set so this one
smelt like very sweetly of lemon and a
little bit of I don't know just like a
little bit of an undertone of baby
powder but it wasn't like too offensive
I did like this kind of smells like like
powdery would use on your baby's bum or
something I used to be a nanny I used to
use this like powder so they wouldn't
get diaper rashes kind of smells like
this from Johnson and Johnson's I
remember that product I don't know why
but that's kind of what it smells like
so I thought this was a pretty nice
scent would probably repurchase this and
yeah so anyway guys that those are all
of my empties for September 2017 I hope
you enjoyed this video thank you so much
for joining me and I'll see you tomorrow
