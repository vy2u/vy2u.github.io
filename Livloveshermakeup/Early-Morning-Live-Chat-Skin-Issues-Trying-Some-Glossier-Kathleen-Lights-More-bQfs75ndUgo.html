person's like an alien it was like alien
Olivia I literally was like I never was
like oh I was never
that kind of person but I definitely
tried to be like that typical beauty
guru I dyed my hair like really blonde I
tried to look like a Barbie doll cuz you
know I thought looking like plastic was
cool which it's not in my opinion what
did you pick up from essentia Beauty I
got to be Foundation and I'm so scared
cuz I feel like the shade is gonna be
way off you are so shy it wasn't even
shy I was just scared I was just scared

said I did get the foundation I'm gonna
do a first impression for you guys this

like a triple version where I actually
walk you guys through all three of my
showers about that might be fun but then
I have to edit the video together I'll
see if I can do that I watched some of
your old videos and I was like see I

trying to get through it and for me I
wake up every day and I don't really do
a lot of creeping I just wake up and
then I film and every day I wake up when
I'm like this is the video I'm gonna do

beginning of the week it's always
something completely different strange

chunky annihilator okay I already have
texture and I don't need highlights kind

starting to like her a lot of you were
telling me to check her out and I love
her personality but I can't I can't

sorry it's just I don't pair to human

not going there guys it was just it
rolled right off her tongue and it
sounded like it's something that she
says frequently I don't care where you
were raised

your neighborhood talk it's just
inappropriate in my opinion all right
the fence he highlights suck I returned
mine okay dose of colors dead the xkt

collection I never got here so they gave
me my money back so though I want to
reorder but I recently saw my friend

pick up the torch highlighter mm-hmm

buy any Tarte product see I bought it it
looks really beautiful in so many people
so many people were requesting that I go

video of eyeshadows that do not have any
fallouts yeah actually today originally
I was going to be posting a video called
let me put a list up here it was going
to be as the kickback ease real 5i
shuttle pellets that are insanely
powdery it because I feel like after the
whole subculture drama like really
really powdery pellets have now so I
thought that would be a fun video to do

on my list as well my parents has his
own YouTube video like I know right I
love watching all sorts of animals I
just like animals more than people yes
alright let's see here what's the best
moisturizer for a midwest winter my
condo skin gets so pissed
what's that sound it's like a popping
sound oh I think my computer is making
little electroshock noises wait what was
the question again
oh comedy you should know moisturizer
hmm maybe something that's like a gel
creme I do believe that the belief balm
is cruelty free from what I have heard
and I think that one is amazing
especially if you do have compost yeah
because it's not too heavy on the skin
but it has that nice kind of like
consistency to it that's what I would
recommend I never use that heavy-duty of
like moisturizers when I did have more
combo skin now I'm dry and apparently I
also happened was at the same time so
you know let me lie over here but anyway
I'm gonna go ahead and put a little skin
here on here so these are the NIP plus
PAB dragon's blood it's mixed cleansing
pads this is not a sponsored video okay
literally just want to clear up my face
these have hyaluronic acid and a salt
silic acid in them why is my face look
so pink on camera it's like everything's
just pink pink but anyway I thought this
would be a nice to pair together with a
moisturizer here this has actually sent
to me this is the velocity a the focus
is called priming a moisturizer it's
home rich luxurious a face cream we
suppose to me yesterday and I thought
it'd be nice to try out we'll see um
because like I said I have breakouts
right now but I'm still unseemly dry
which really really sucks alright let's
see here you don't get to decide whether
or not other people accept her apology
yeah that's - I mean listen you're
allowed to have your own opinion on the
matter but I that's my opinion and I'm
just not I'm not okay with it so I don't
care if it was an accident it didn't
sound like an accident to me um you know
I'm just not going with it let's see
here you know your sponsor I know red
knit plus a sponsor you guys give this
video thumbs up velocities thank you

her around for
those things are huge I quit using
Sephora play oh yeah I had to play - yes
gruffly it was just okay
I loved the deluxe sized samples from
Sephora but it's just one of those
things where I felt like I had a reefing
already every single month I already
have the product in full size or example
size will you pick up these things and
center Khaled's yes absolutely I think
it looks amazing
yes did you guys see the swatches on it
very good

little so I can answer some of these
questions my Curtis expired and then I
was like oh well look boxycharm bullseye
highlighter really nice yeah it was
Becca highlights love that are you going
to rethink it giving to be peachy Maps
palette absolutely and not you guys I
know that a lot of people are saying it
looks like the collection is pretty good
after all and listen yes I crocheted a
to face with these two my favorite
brands okay so I'm not gonna stay here
and say like don't absolutely don't buy
it I mean watch multiple reviews decide
what you want I did an anti haul on the
products I haven't even tried them so I
can't give a full review but no not
going to be trying it just not
interested too gimmicky from me honestly
I'm just kind of done with that when it
comes to cheap face yes yes gross video
coming soon
I'm a BH or a Becca blushes that's a
really tough one I'm gonna have to go
with honest hacia Beverly Hills the back
blushes are really really nice though
alright let me come on some of this
little guy right here actually this is
like semi embarrassing all these
products were actually sent to me it's
not like a sponsor video but they were
sent to me for PR I feel like such a
bougie guru right now I have a code down
below for you guys know who is the
Brazilian kiss papapaa lip butter I
can't say it I can't say it but this is
from Sol de Janeiro it smells like a
thief bum bum gram you know that really
really nice ass
smells amazing it smells exactly like
that it tastes really good it's not my
favorite I would not purchase it with my
own money personally I feel like he can
get a better deal at the drugstore like
the birds bees won't they're just as
good by it is really really big and it's
kind of Martin's like it goes everywhere
it's not like the size of a glue stick
but I know it's the one that I had on
hand all right let's see
does it smell really good like the lip
out of the AK oh my god yeah so the
boom-boom cream and the Brazilian kiss
lip butter as well as the shower gel all
smell the same like in a bottle all
right guys let's try out this Galassi a
product so okay look for can you find
her all right so here's this little
cover right here oh that kind of smells
like ass oh you know what no no no
doesn't on a second sniff it actually
smells pretty good it kind of smells
like the bleep cream I don't know why it
smells like it really it doesn't all
right this is super super thick as you
guys can probably see sorry I'm having
to go back and forth between Adi elect
and my video here but I'm just gonna
play a little bit of this I don't like
to do too much skin here on video
because people always complain about how
I apply it my scooter
I'm very rough with my face oh you know
what this does smell like ass yeah I
take it back I take it back again I'm
sorry there's a lot I don't do a lot of
first impressions because first
impressions are it's not like
ass and then it smell pretty good and
now it smells like ass again um it just
kind of smells would be sort of like the
Sunday Riley Luna oil you know that
really natural scent we're kind of like
oh yeah can you just talk like chop down
a tree and kind of like put it into that
container there because that's what
that's what this smells like my face is
so red now but it looks really glowy so
this is actually supposed to be a primer
but also in moisturizer it means that at
night time it sense them it's basically
just a moisturizer you can use any
moisturizer as a primer all right so let
me throw back a little bit here now I
was here two-face is her ex meaning she
still loves the og but is pissed off
yeah a lot of Donna products from duvets
you know like
are you wearing to face I'm like uh
people might be friendly still have good
products you guys it's just the newer
stuff hasn't been that great let's see
uh I really let's pray for the people in
Florida and Texas I know you guys my dad
was actually in Florida right now when
he did you evacuate he's at the condo in
Daytona Beach and he called me and you
know he's like taking his windows and
 I'm like why didn't you leave very
worried about him
so we'll see you to face or tarts
you mean like don't hate them you guys
obviously I have products from those
brands that I do enjoy but right now I
would choose tarts I've been a lot more
I've been partial to tart lately so yes
sorry
it's a sad and terrifying I'm so lucky I
got out yeah I'm really glad you
evacuated that was very scary I was
seeing in New York for hurricane sandy
and one of my windows blew in on the
28th floor and scared the living
out of me peaches and cream is actually
super legit
I'm loving the collection and a well
Erica see how it is trying to throw
shade at me I see how it is no I'm sure
there are some good products I'm just
not personally Anderson I'm just not
into a let's see here it feels like the
world ending with everything going on I
know there's a lot of stuff going on
when are you going to be roasting some
peaches very soon very soon hopefully
the videos that I have on the list for
this week or the kickback is real five
eyes shadow palette that are insanely
powdery Natasha do Nonna Lima palettes
do Fendi heavy by Rihanna the pros ultra
soft matte long wear foundation I want
to do a first impressions than the eight
hour wear test for you guys and then on
Thursday I want to do mascaras that
perform better after they dry out I know
that sounds really weird but sometimes
you get those really really wet formulas
as far as mascaras are concerned and
they just go on so gloopy and they don't
look good and then you leave it open for
like a couple of weeks not like six
months like a couple of weeks and then
the formula gets better a little more
dry and it just sticks to the eyelashes
better you get better volume I want to
talk about that and then on Friday to
our cosmetics holiday 2017 I did pick up
a big artist little highlighter and I
did pick up at the treasure tool brush
set so I
do a review and demo on those items and
then Saturday will be the best and worst
for it be balm cosmetics and then Sunday
so yeah that is the list but I rarely
follow the list just a heads up all
right guys I'm gonna put some eye cream
on I'm looking at the finer thing I just
don't know why it looks so crazy now
like I really am dry so that's confusing
so I'm gonna take it the elf
illuminating eye cream because I got
like six hours of sleep last night no
I'm sorry I got like four hours of sleep
six would be nice I got about four hours
of sleep last night and it was not
enough it was not enough so I will take
whatever I can get when it comes to a
nice illuminating eye cream trying to be
so gentle you know like those
people that give the videos and they're
like just pressing it on both in reality
I'm just like I know I know
used to work at Sephora in the finger
Department I know I'm just really
aggressive I do everything so fast and
just you know being good so delicate oh
my the ring finger are in Sierre
let me get back to these freaking ah
comments over here because I am just
having too much fun with this eye cream
any plans to check out to be 2017 at ten
a pan around a blush palette from a
tarts it's very possible I do usually
like those palettes and they're not
identical to the full-size that
everybody gets this confused I don't
like the big of blush books the little
round palettes are somewhat good but the
full-size blushes aren't the best it's
so strange I feel like I have like a
rating system when it comes to chart but
it's possible that I will go ahead Anna
pick one of those up I got a new job it
up time yay congratulations no cool I
know you're on a two-piece kick about
what are your thoughts on the boss lady
palettes I oh oh the big one right I
mean I it doesn't doesn't look
interesting to me personally so I don't
know it kind of looks like every other
palette the Too Faced releases you know
what I mean I just feel like every
single problem
with and the turquoise or a purple
you're talking about wait this is
two-faced right the boss lady patty I
think it is they are doing like a
planner sorted Mega Man I think the boss
lady
they have like a purple shade and a
green shade thrown into a bunch of
neutrals and I mean I just don't need
more of those neutrals hello Liv I am
freckled Faris everyone and no time
makeup what brushes do you recommend and
highlight brands preferably a JUCO or
college I will be applying on fresh skin
no foundation honestly I think with
freckles and fair skin and a strawberry
blonde hair and the anasazi Beverly
Hills mucho cloak it would look
bomb on you that would be amazing
that is a palette so you get quite a few
highlights in there but there are some
shades like pink part that would be
gorgeous on you live I love you so glad
I got to catch you like a s'more again I
know it's very early this morning I know
everybody will be able to make it but I
still wanted to jump on because I just
felt like doing a live stream today

of me uh that's it Liv I'm sending your
peaches and cream some of it anywhere I

lip kits that are $28 worth it for
sample sizes and one a full size hmm are
they you mean like deluxe sizes right
the left side samples if it's deluxe
sized samples I say yes if it's like

old woman to me I'm kind of getting sick
of the whole scented thing in my makeup
I feel like that's why my face is
breaking out like this is probably
because I have fragrance all up in my
products know what I mean I'm not really
into it anymore
when lip smears we all take a shot you
guys will be drunk
do you follow Beauty News Channel yes oh
my god I've recently gotten into their
videos I like to listen to them as I
fall asleep at night they were very
calming unlike me they're great mommy I
applied for a job at Ulta and got it and
a smash the window and wait wait by what
and our tree frickin smash the window oh
no I'm so worried horrible
okay let's see here and let me scroll up
and look at some more questions what's
your thoughts on the whole packing light
situation I've already talked about it I
unsubscribe I don't I'm not pervasive
silence I don't care who says I'm not
going there so no all right let's see
your this has been a welcome surprise
review to watch I'm in the hospital and
needed a pick-me-up oh no actually I
hope you feel better I'm so sorry to
hear that
oh man ah lookee here don't leave I will
see you on the stand now yeah it looks
like I have 10% I'm good I'm good if I
randomly just disappear you guys know
why you're gonna show us your beauty
room as soon highest-earning said yes
absolutely I still have a few more
pieces that I want to put in but it's a
very like dark and kind of Bambi room
it's like nothing like the whole beauty
room because the old Beauty room I put
it together when I wanted to be like
every other booty euro a bodega row
everything was all whites and the Alex
series nine door and that that got
so dirty so fast like I can't even tell
you how many lipsticks like white beauty
lipsticks just landed right on top of
that freaking Alex series my brother
horrible so I'm going with the darker
colors which is more me anyway might not
seem like it is alright let's see good
morning everybody
hello good morning that's on it
benefits you've never been at that baby
with me I'm a benefit I feel like that
is kind of one of those brands that
relies on gimmicky packaging to do well
and I'm gonna do a video about that like
brands that rely on gimmicky packaging
to actually actually sell stuff but I
don't know like the box blushes are good
but when they come out with these
holiday pellets there's nothing like a
full-size I used to have a full-size of
for at least uh coralina remember what
it's called I'm a dandelion which looks
like a lighter bullet um kind of pink
shade Laguna I mean I got everything not
Laguna that's NARS but what am I
thinking of hoola
sorry I don't purchased from them
anymore because they are a natural t3
but hoola yeah I just felt like the
palace that they came out with it was
not the same and I wasn't really a huge
fan of those little box blushes just the
packaging in general I felt like it was
kind of cute so yeah anyway um all right
let's see here that's on next element
palettes I want to get one until I saw
that face idea that's ridiculous I'm
gonna buy those I feel like sorry she'll
feel my own saliva
I feel like $30 like really nice like
way gonna be like that why yes Marianne
primary benefit is just happening they
are just packaging that's exactly what
they are and they do all this brown
stuff and it's all the same and then
they go and they put like bigger beauty
gurus on a box and then you're like hi
this that's like no no thank you but I
would see here benefit kills the bunny
before their blushes yes you do yes they
do
uh yeah and Nick's price tag is
ridiculous absolutely I was so surprised
when I saw that I really wanted the fire
and houses the air palettes and I was
like nope how's your lip is I'm going
into a flare I'm so sorry to hear that
Eden I've been doing really really well
you guys know I love Samantha Samantha
it's just I love her anyway what was I
saying
wait let me scroll back oh yes blue best
so as far as Lucas is concerned it's
going really well I'm sorry that you are
going into a flare I have been on a
little bit of a trial here in Arizona
you really talk about it yet getting
like pain meds and all this and they're
doing all these strange things you know
to my joints and if you guys don't know
I have rheumatoid arthritis rheumatoid
it a rheumatoid arthritis in my hands
which sucks because I am a classical
flutist and also have it in my knees so
they wanted to do some research on that
and then also my liver my liver has
almost failed like two or three times I
haven't really talked about that in
depth of I taught my lupus is doing good
I haven't been like in a flare for about
four to five months so pretty good
alright let's see here I'm gonna scroll
back up here live I love you I love you
to you
I love seeing other YouTube people in
each other yes they love each other we
were just talking out of my tongue snap
Jack we both have like ridiculously long
lists of videos I was like just swap and
then I do all of her video ideas in the
shoot of all my latest genius
okay yes that needs to happen all right
let's see here love and positive
thoughts I'm glad to hear you're well
thank you and you first time ever seen a
live video I'm here so happy for the new
phone will you do a video on your
condition I would love to know more
about it yes I have done videos on lupus
before I think I have a whole playlist
dedicated to it so yes yes genius yeah
it was just a SWOT those lists and then
that's my problem is that I start
writing a videos down and then I get so
saying about the new one I'm like
the old ones like why would I want to do
that like I want to do the new
stuff and then people are like you
promised that other video live so then I
end up with a list of like 130 ideas
yes I can't seem to think of like really
really interesting like thumbnails to do
so I can think of ideas and then
thumbnails I'm like I don't know what it
is I have to stop drinking because of my
liver and all of my life being on it med
yeah I can't drink that much either so
yeah I had an operation on Monday and
your video may be happy what I'm staying
at all I hope you're feeling okay holy
grail cleansers
really about the pesky cleanser from
drunk elephant you guys it's so good
it's so good oh it is so good I mean I
love it too for my well I mean I'm
breezy but I also have tons of pimples
ah Normandy down here in Arizona I have
normal to dry skin and it's just perfect
it's perfect it doesn't sting I can put
it around my eye area it's gentle it can
be used as a second cleanse it's just it
doesn't strip the skin I love it I love
it really enjoy that one it's a very
very expensive though I wouldn't
recommend if you do cover like
comparably skin but you're more drying
or normal I think you would enjoy it all
right oh my god I finally got on a live
stream hi already - do you use products
with microbeads I try and not to I know
that those are going to be supposed to
be 2017 those are very bad for the
environment they have to do the whole
body so that they can actually like
break down because unfortunately your
battery is going to die I'm a 7% guy I
can do it I can do it if the screen just
goes black listen I want you by I'm
sorry sorry uh what was I saying
oh man you guys help me hmm Bhd
okay it was just answer a different
question what a beauty palette yay or
nay I found out they Buddha like trying
to sell mink cruelty-free lashes because
she likes to sit there was a little mace
on her lap and actually like comb them
which is like impossible since these are
super kind of vicious and you don't just
sit there and comb them out and take
their hairs and put them on your eyes uh
yeah I don't think you're old and gray
so no no for me all right let's see have
you seen the new lush Halloween range I
haven't but you guys just lush up and
everything to me ever since I stopped
purchasing from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works cuz
they were just going back and forth on
this cruelty-free status every time I
would pause someone would give me a
different answer on key that don't
play games with me okay if these are
your planking free or not okay so I
stopped purchasing from them and now
and I go to assess everything from lush
are you going to show the Pharisees eyes
that they aren't sleeping right now I
really don't want to wake them I'm sorry
your thoughts on the new Charlotte
Tilbury palette I haven't even seen
it did trendy was most about it I try to
follow that stuff but I'll have to go
back and look yeah Charlotte Tilbury is
amazing they have sent me a PR package
before it was beautiful elegant
cruelty-free what is this mmm this hair
though Arum oh well candles do you
recommend alright so for me since I'm
not purchasing for Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
anymore I really do like which City
website
I like the Pacifica candles they were
cruelty-free vegan and also like free
books which is great and they tried to
drum elephants bar cleansers I haven't
but I've heard really really good things
so I'm gonna look into that lo see mr.
beyond his room but I know actually like
live stream way earlier this morning but
usually people don't like to do live
streams in the morning around this time
as well because not look up so you know
I can see as we've gone along here more
people are starting to chime in
so have you as seen on the torts limited
edition of treasure box collectors that
thing Jen will on live stream look at my
up haul skin happy hey uh yeah young
below my soon I was watching I was
watching it looks like good quality I'm
still not getting it I just don't trust
meter by shelf Alex I'm sorry like it
looks good I will say but I feel like
for me they always look good and then I
get them on my eyes and people are good
at blending and I'm like I don't know
how to blend can you blend you can this
eyeshadow blend itself that's what I'm
looking for
what Becca palette always saw the Becca
public said a weird the shape of it was
kind of strange I don't know it's not
weird to be like I don't want it because
and the shape of it was round and I
don't want a round palette it's not like
that it's just it was very it didn't
even look like an eyeshadow I don't know
how to describe it it did not really
excite me I'm even too Sweden yes and my
dad is my best across Sweden so did you
buy anything from the Ulta
say hi i bieber NYC hi um yes I did I I
love who I was like guys snapchat I
listen the often 21 days I give you
about sucks
and then I think I've already placed an
order for 12 items but some of them were
more like under the hot by section I do
feel like the Ulta 21 days the beauty
event was not that great
mm-hmm the only good thing is the
originated color correcting fluids which
I'm getting or sure I can't find a lip
scrub but that works well can you
recommend one have you tried the bubble
gum or popcorn or a mint julep lip scrub
up from lush it's it's really really
good you guys I just I was supposed to
take my second dose of ADHD medication
um about 10 minutes ago can you already
tell I can you see when the men start to
wear off I have to take two kind of back
to back in the morning I can just feel
myself getting more and more hyper
everybody let the year it's like a turn
on tour pop yes that's exactly what it
looks like that I think that would who
looks like I was gonna use when I
thought I was honestly really really
confused I missed the candle
recommendation so which City wicks and
also Pacifica
let's see your lip scrubs from lush I
laugh my ass off they're actually really
good and you can eat them I mean
technically you're also eating your dry
skin but I mean I don't know how do you
feel about that you do you like eating
your skin I make you do you can anyone
tell me what does she set it yes are big
oh wait oh no what she said about what
um a let's see here they're gonna
discontinue the popcorn lip scrub why
though lots of luscious just continuing
everything that's good I was like it
just you ruined my hopes and
dreams why don't you lush uh yeah I saw
they were doing I don't I don't get it
do you have email yeah I do the
Bubblegum one is my favorite me too I
lick it off my lips delicious bubblegum
yeah if you I know I know I know I don't
think people actually understand that
like it edible but like you are eating
your skin but I just it tasted my skin
live how is the cue spirit like it is
very good the babies are exhausted right
now being like
run around at nighttime and play with
each other when I'm not here so
sometimes when I come in in the morning
they're exhausted and sleeping together
which is adorable but I'm like what
about me do you love mommy you don't
want to play with me all right let's see
here coverfx it drops or I hunt my
battery just oh I put the brightness
down so it started going back up mm-hmm
I'm a genius
wait what was I saying oh god I lost
this I'm sorry they're so gorgeous can
we send you emails against them let's
see here they are just the cutest and
making you want to get a friend for Ares
oh my god Ares and a ferret I can't
imagine the two of them just doing their
flops you guys don't follow Samantha
unsnapped oh she's this adorable dog
that does this very very dramatic sort
of dropped to the floor after she's done
with her walk every day and she just
kind of sits there and then she just
spoke I just like her body just
collapses and is absolutely it is that
really amazing yes love it let's see
live what is your most favorite tea oh
my god that's so difficult I need to do
a lifestyle favorites again so I can
catch up on tea time
live like I'm the queen of starting new
series on my channel and then never
following through with that but yes I
love all sorts of teas you guys I mean
right now I would say maybe the
gingerbread flat from Teavana I know I
was kind of like well listen I already
got all my like we're gonna holiday
decorations out all the fall stuff so
yeah I'm already drinking fault even
though it's 104 degrees here all right I
was underwhelmed by in the Oh God okay
the chat just moved really quickly hold
on guys I think my chat is lagging
behind yours she is so cute Sam yeah
Aries is really truly everything her
dramatic swaps they make my morning
everybody
I've always wanted a ferret I'm about to
move in with my boyfriend though and
between the two of us we have five cats
yeah parents actually get along with
cats you should go get one no yurts you
actually get along pretty well with cats
that house kind of similar body language
and very plate won't get hurt by a cat
or anything like that like you could
never combine a ferret with the
announcer or anything like that they're
not rodents but they will kill bunnies
and stuff like that so they actually do
better with dogs and cats that's
comfortable
lip products well I need to say it but I
love my NARS velvet lip lines now and
NARS has decided to go ahead and start
selling in China so they are no longer
cruelty free so let me try again let me
try again with that particular question
I really enjoy the elf
Wow what is it calm it's like there's
gonna say quat from if cosmetics but
better what does it call this like this
little like a white thing and then you
put it on a stank booty guru right here
coming at you with the recommendations

just say it's called the elf lip glow
limo you guys it's really good at least
this beautiful color to your lips
business I'm very moisturizing and
glossy and my lips always reflection all
the time and actually looks good on my
lips so I like that
