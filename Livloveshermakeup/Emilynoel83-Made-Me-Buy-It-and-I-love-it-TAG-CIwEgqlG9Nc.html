happy Tuesday today we are doing a of
you requested video as well as one I'm
super excited about and this is going to
be the Emily Noel 83 it made me buy a
tag so I did not create this tag there
was actually a girl who created it two
years ago I will link her channel and
her video down below I always like to
give credit where credit is due if you
are someone who else would love emily
noel 83 i highly recommend that you do
this tag i think it's a lot of fun you
can pick out as many products as you
want that maybe she introduced you to
she introduces her subscribers to a lot
of new stuff and just like old
favourites that she has because she
pretty much has well i don't want to say
she has a review channel because she
does a lot of tutorials and she does a
lot of reviews i'm mostly a review
channel but she she has a mixture of
everything if you don't know who she is
of course i would link her down below as
well but i'm sure you already know who
she is so one of my favorite things
about emily is just the fact that she's
so down to earth and she's not
competitive or like weird about makeup
does that make sense you know i feel
like sometimes the beauty community gets
very aggressive about you know who's the
best tutorial person who is the best at
doing makeup and i think that there's a
different aspect of or a different side
of the beauty community as well there
are people who just like to collect and
also review and do things like that so i
think she kind of started that you know
she's like an OG youtuber she's been on
youtube for quite a while now and she
was one of the first people I subscribed
to I love that she kind of opened up
that door of hey you don't have to be a
professional makeup artist to do a
beauty vlogging stuff you know you can
also review products you can also do
empties videos favorites videos things
like that so I really do enjoy her and I
just love how unbiased and unspun sir
she is to be quite blunt so anyway let's
go ahead and jump right into it I'm
gonna share with you guys the products
and outs of the brands that she
introduced me to that I love so yeah
let's do it the first item I want to
talk about is the NYC smooth skin
bronzer in the shade sunny she was
definitely the first youtuber that I
heard talking about this I have had this
particular one for I believe about four
or five years it has not changed in the
slightest it doesn't smell bad nope it
smells normal to me it goes on
beautifully it's very very smooth and I
just really like the way this looks on
my skin now I have someone who does have
a fair complexion with a cool undertone
and even though this does lean a little
more on the warm tone side I think it's
beautiful if you don't want to use it
all over your face you definitely can
use it as a transition shade for your
eye area
it's really gorgeous very very smooth
and nice and for the price you just
can't beat it alright the second product
that she definitely introduced me to was
the covergirl clump crusher mascara now
this is not something I would repurchase
if you guys didn't know I'm working on
going cruelty free with my collection
but I will be going ahead and keeping
this wand because I don't think it's the
formula of the mascara I think it's the
wand that is amazing so I really enjoy
using this on my bottom lashes
I have tried using it like on my upper
lashes I prefer more of a clumpy kind of
look on my upper lashes which I know is
not for everyone but that's what I like
so I like to use this one on the bottom
lashes it's really really good at
separating and it's a great base mascara
with a great base mascara alright and
the next thing that she definitely
introduced me to was actually a brand
this is the bite Beauty brand now I
remember back in like 2014 watching her
videos on the 2014 holiday ellipse set I
was still in college at the time I
definitely didn't have the money that I
do now to go ahead and purchase the
items that I can now so I remember when
she said 25 dollars for for little lip
pencils I was like oh I should go get
that and I have been in love ever since
so these guys are actually from the 2015
holiday set too they are the matte creme
lip crayons right matte creme lip
crayons in the shades cool a and also
tort but they have lip pencils they have
the butter cream lipsticks or they used
to have the butter cream lipsticks which
were amazing I got the shade Heather
after I also Emily there well 83
reviewed it but now they do have the
amuse-bouche formulation I got the like
I said the 2014-2015 and this year's set
and honestly they're just so beautiful I
feel like the formulation on every
single product that they have is great
to their bite Beauty of Gabbi lip mask
is fantastic and they are a cruelty free
brand that is also edible they are food
grade I'm not recommending that you eat
these but you can eat them if you want
to so yeah I really do enjoy the bite
Beauty brand and Emily it was definitely
the person can introduce me to that
brand alright we have two blushes here
from covergirl like I said I am working
on going cruelty free so I won't
repurchase these but I never would have
gotten them in the first place if she
hadn't recommend them because honestly
look at the package on these they are
just very very basic looking but these
are so special these are the classic
color blushes the first shade we have
here is her favorite which is called
soft mink this is definitely more of
like a nude kind of color and it has a
little bit of a silver sheen to it
actually think
them have a silver chain to it so here
is the shade soft mink these are just
beautiful on the skin and there's really
no way to describe it until you actually
get it on to your face but there is the
shade soft mitten you guys see the sheen
on that isn't that gorgeous and then my
personal favorite is this one right here
which is called rose silk now this one's
obviously more of a cool toned pink
color and definitely has a gorgeous
gorgeous silver sheen to it again but
yet these are beautiful definitely a
hidden gem at the drugstore for sure so
there is Soph mink and then there is
rose silk never would have picked these
up if she wouldn't have said that they
were fabulous all right the next thing I
want to talk about are the NYX butter
glosses she definitely introduced me to
these as well I do agree with her when
she says that some of the lighter shades
are a little more patchy but my favorite
sheet is called tiramisu I have I think
three of those opened currently so the
shade I have right here is called cherry
cheesecake these are from NYX Cosmetics
I don't know if I said that yet but they
are cruelty free and then here we have
the shade apple strudel which is a
little more of a peachy light pink color
these are beautiful I love the way they
go on they are very very humectant they
lock in the moisture they're very smooth
they're very creamy and buttery and I do
think the deeper shades are a little
better than the lighter ones but they're
really fantastic if you're looking for a
good a drugstore creamy lip gloss I
would highly recommend these another lip
product that is actually relatively new
that she introduced me to are definitely
the NARS Velvet lip glides I wanted to
get to the holiday set but it sold out
so incredibly quickly but I was thinking
about getting this particular one which
is called bound and then she actually
did a lip swatch video and she swatched
every single one of them and I
immediately was like I need those she
was saying that they are very smooth and
creamy and buttery they're kind of like
a hybrid of like a lip oil and a lip
gloss and a lipstick in one and honestly
they are you guys they are so incredibly
beautiful I love the way that they wear
on the lips that was the worst swatch
ever all right there we go
I love the way that they wear on the
lips and I just feel like they wear off
beautifully they don't look too obvious
I think she said with the darker shades
sometimes they do look a little more
obvious which is kind of normal but the
lighter shades like this one right here
are just beautiful absolutely stunning
so she introduced me to those and then
finally the last thing I want to talk
about is the balm cosmetics the brand
she was the one who introduced me to
this for sure I never was into the balm
cosmetics they actually
never really heard about them she does a
lot of reviews on their eyeshadow
palettes and just a lot of their
palettes in general but I did fall in
love with their blush formulation and
now they do have the in stain blushes
which are incredibly long wearing it
great but I do think they're regular
blushes are great as well you can get
these like half-price on HauteLook
um probably what is there like once a
month I feel like the balm cosmetics is
not HauteLook quite often but yeah these
are really really good so the first one
I have here also just the packaging look
at the packaging the particular bone is
called down boy
it is a cool tone pink shade it's
beautiful it is matte and like I said
these we're an incredibly long time I
also do have this one right here which
is called hot mama and she was the one
who told her subscribers that this is to
do for Narses or katham which is why I
never went ahead and picked up narses
orgasm why would I do that when I can
get this one so this is definitely more
peachy tone with a little bit of a gold
iridescent as you can see and then
finally I have this one right here which
is called frat boy and I kind of feel
like I don't know if down boys my
favorite or this one I reach for this a
lot even though it is a little more warm
toned it has this gorgeous gorgeous kind
of like I don't even know how to
describe it it is completely matte but I
have like a little bit of like a nectar
or orangie undertone and it just looks
beautiful on the cheek so she was
definitely the one that introduced me to
the balm cosmetics and also mary-lou
manizer which everybody loves so anyway
those are the five products that and we
Noel 83 introduced me to that I
absolutely love I would love to know
down below in the comment section what
she introduced you guys to and what you
like and yeah that's pretty much it
thanks for joining me guys and I'll see
you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
