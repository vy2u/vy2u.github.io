how are you guys doing I'm trying to get
comfy on my chair because i am filming
empties for you guys except for this is
like a really big month for empties this
is my August empties I have two huge
bags to share with you guys and I
literally have like a huge box right
below me on this side where I'm just
gonna be dropping things in and when i
am done filming i will separate
everything that's going into the trash
and everything that's going into the
recycling and then i will go on from
there and put things where they need to
be but let's just get started i used up
a lot of stuff this month so yeah let's
get right into it the first thing I used
up were these chick intuition renewing
moisture cartridges this is the
pomegranate extract one this is for the
chick intuition which looks like that
the razor these are the razor head
refills I really really liked this scent
these are very expensive these are like
twenty dollars for six cartridges at
target so I like to go on and off
between using like a mens razor and then
using the intuition like every other
month just because the cartridges are so
expensive so I really really like this
scent though it was really nice sorry
it's a little dirty they're gross
alright moving on it I used up the body
shop um what is this early harvest
raspberry body scrub this was really
nice it says they had raspberry fruit
extract and raspberry seeds it looks
like this this was really really nice it
was very gentle and the actual particles
that were like exfoliating were actual
raspberry seat so that was kind of cute
my boyfriend I used up the honeydew
cooler deep cleansing hand soap from
Bath and Body Works it is a blend of
summer melon and frozen Kiwi it looks
like this um it smells amazing it was
really really good smelling yeah we
really really enjoyed this one this was
very nice we had this in our bathroom um
another deep cleansing hand soap that we
have in our bathroom it looks like it
broke a little bit is the bath and
Bodyworks sparkling sweet nectarine deep
cleansing hand soap and this is fresh
nectarine and sweet basil this also
smelt really good we had this in our
bathroom as well we liked it a lot but
we preferred the honeydew cooler ones
hold on let me wipe my hands up all
right get a little sippy sippy of
something ah these oh my gosh she's
Lacroix or Lacroix Zhaan natural mango
oh girl so good love it all right moving
on I used up the hydroxatone balancing
toner this was just okay I probably
would not repurchase it has some witch
hazel in it I think and it actually made
my skin a little sensitive and a little
dry so I didn't love it um you step the
frozen huggies one-and-done refreshing
cucumber and green tea i like to use
these to remove swatches just after
putting on my makeup to wipe my hand
things like that um I used up another
toner this is the polished choice resist
advanced replenishing toner it's all
dirty obviously something opened up in
one of these bags but this is what it
looked like this was a really really
nice towner I'm I was very sick and very
like moisturizing I feel like
something's like coming off it was
really nice kind of thick very very
moisturizing I liked it a lot um we used
up or I used up defrosted cranberry bath
jelly from the body shop this was nice I
know it sounds like it's a very wintry
sent however I don't know it's like one
of those things where it's like it
smells like cranberries which is like a
fruit too it's very like sweet smelling
so it could still the use during the
summer I liked it a lot it makes really
really nice soft bubbles you just take
the jelly in your hand and you put it
underneath warm water and you just kind
of fold it there and it makes tons and
tons of my stock levels I used up the
cooler water spa cucumber shampoo I did
not actually use this on my hair I used
this to clean or deep clean my makeup
brushes but I liked it a lot I've used
up a sample of the amore Pacific future
response age defense cream spf30 this
was nice it did leave a white cast on my
face though so I probably would not
purchase a full-size bed I used up this
adorable shower cap look how cute this
is can you guys see that it has like
this like embroided like flower print on
it but it got a little grungy it's time
to go I used up a bath and body works
three with candle in the scent oceanside
you it's all sticky something opened up
in here it's disgusting but this was a
really nice sent it
says it is a blend of sun-ripened citrus
juicy melon and refreshing Ocean air
brings you to a perfect day on the shore
and it just really really smell good I
liked it a lot alright next I used up
another one of the bath and body works
tree with candles this was spiked cherry
lime sickle this was really nice to it
had a really nice warm scent to it and
has said it is a blend of summer
cherries juicy Parisian limes and
sparkling sugar crystals that deliver
happiness like a cherry on top so really
really liked that one as well um I've
used up the body shop vitamin E
hydrating toner alcohol-free toning
liquid with a shot of vitamin E
protection this is really nice
especially if you have dry skin I like
that a lot I would repurchase used up
the poo pourri in the juniper woods sent
this stuff works just get it try it
before you bash it I used up one of the
Bay Breeze hydrating shots from dry bar
this is really really nice I like these
a lot these are good for like special
occasions when you need an extra shot of
like my sis to your hair I used up the
tony moly red apple hand cream so cute
love the packaging love this hand cream
it smells amazing I used up another 3

champagne it smell amazing really really
loved this these little pop tale ones
were so cute i love those for the summer
um the ponds evening suit wet cleansing
towelettes with camel mill and white TV
smell amazing they're really really nice
at nighttime they are a little abrasive
and harsh so if you have sensitive skin
I would not recommend I used up a bag of
the cotton squares padded 100-percent
cotton soft and strong square sophs from
the up and up which is the target
compared to brand these were just okay I
like my cotton squares to be a little
thicker I used up the sample of the body
shops neutrik annex drops of youth youth

like this that much I've heard really
really great things but I don't think I

favorite dry shampoos and this was a
really nice scent
used up these little pack of dentex

but this was really really nice I like
this a lot smelt really good and was
nice at exfoliating in the morning I
used up the near ad invisible or

have body breakouts this will banish
them very quickly I used up the hawaiian

really nice very very lightweight and it
smells amazing would repurchase a tide

than just applying some you know
moisturize are underneath your eyes or
an eye cream I used up a shower cap from
roses from I think of Mariette we stayed
at a marriott and i used up this nude
omega treatment rescue oil this was
really really nice i liked this it does
smell a little funky but i think it's
because they have all natural
ingredients used up the citrus fusion
bath bar this is also from i eat either
the hyatt or i don't know country inn or
some kind of hotel this was nice I liked
that body bar used up the living proof
conditioner

summer was watermelon lemonade and this

polish remover this was nice I liked it
a lot I would repurchase used the bumble
and bumble surf foam wash shampoo and
creme rinse conditioner samples I like
these i actually use this last night and

through the up and up of cotton balls
