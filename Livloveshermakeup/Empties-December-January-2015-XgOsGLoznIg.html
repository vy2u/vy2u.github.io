works bag and i thought i'd just go
through them with you guys so let's get
started the first thing I used up was
this Listerine total care fresh mint
anticavity mouthwash it looks like that
I didn't love this it really kind of
stung um my mouth like it has alcohol in
it and I just didn't like it so no I
will not refer to that next I got I used
up the extra large cleansing cloths from
up enough this is the target brand these
were really nice for removing him hands
off my makeup removing makeup off my
hands when I applying my makeup i
usually use baby wipes for that but at
the time I was in Milwaukee and I
thought I'd just get those because I had
a target near me next I used up one of
these um what is this anthony i want to
say Anthony mark yeah Marc Anthony
that's I'm sorry Marc Anthony hydrating
coconut oil with shea butter a deep
nourishing conditioning treatment for
hair I traveled a lot these past two
months so that was really helpful i also
used up the Garnier clean plus soothing
makeup removing cleansing towelettes
these were nice i prefer the cream
cleanser for removing my makeup though
next I used up this anti breakage
keratin oil three-minute miraculous
recovery mask from organics this was
nice I liked the smell I don't think I
would repurchase it didn't leave my hair
with like a nice flip or anything so
probably won't repurchase that next I
used up the tree hot shade sugar scrub
in tropical mango love to this this is a
great scent I absolutely love this line
definitely would repurchase i also used
up a tree hut soothing himalayan salt
scrub in cherry blossom and this was
just as good as the sugar scrub i think
i prefer the sugar scrub it felt like it
was a little more gritty um then the
salt which is interesting because
normally the salt would be but this was
a really nice scent next I used up the
L'Oreal Paris total total repair extreme
emergency recovery mask I liked this I
would consider repurchasing they have
one in the tub form too but I found that
this
with easier to UM like squeeze out so
would repurchase that one not the top
form next I used FB summer's eve island
splash cleansing wash you gotta clean
down there girls it's important to keep
everywhere very clean I love the scent
of this the smells like candy and yeah
definitely would repurchase next I'd
used up this juice beauty the organic
solutions green apple peel sensitive I
didn't actually use this on my face I
used it on my hands and I loved it um
next I used up the Pantene weekly rehab
creme and i love this i would definitely
repurchase this is just like a mask that
you put in your hair and yes love it
smelled amazing next I used up the
burberry 02 perfume for women it looks
like that really really happy it's
always really exciting when you used up

an accomplishment so I was really happy

Beauty organic cotton balls 80 count I
love the organic ones they're really
really thick and fluffy they're just
wonderful next I used up the secret
clinical strength clear gel powder
protection deodorant I like this um I
like the what is it clinical strength
line but honestly it leaves white marks
and I don't like that so I'm using a
different one from secret right now and
I think I liked it better it smells
better and it doesn't leave any like
white marks so love that next I used up
the avocado and oatmeal clay mask from I
want to say oh yeah 3 min beauty this

easy easy to throw my bag next I used up

conditioning creme rinse and I cut it in
half as you guys can see so I could get
all the product out this was nice this

much better than the other one I use

cleansing towelettes for sensitive skin
from the up and up this is a target
brand compared to simple love those they
were really nice and thick another mark
anthony coconut oil deep conditioning
mask a saying of pampers sensitive baby
wipes these are my favorite to remove
makeup off my hands when I am applying
my makeup and I just don't want to wash
them because you know get stuck in like
the crevices in your fingers so my
favorites are those they're also good
for taking off swatches because they
don't um like dry out your skin which I
like I used up the Neutrogena makeup
remover cleansing towelettes liked these
they left a nice like residue on the
face that wasn't like super oily or
anything but honestly they made me break

very very gentle so yeah I used up the
