welcome back to this huge bag of empties
so basically I led to my empty stock up
for much much much too long I actually
have both februari and marched for you
guys in this bag today so let's get
started again somehow no I'm going to
keep it on my lap um let's just let's
just get started the first thing I have
is the three wick candle from Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works in sparkling icicles it looks
like this it smells amazing is really
really fresh smelling and it was just
like so so good it says that it is um I
spluttering under the Sun this fragrance
features a citrus bouquet bergamo and a
touch of holiday moss so I really liked
the way that smell alright another three
wick candle from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works was
the frosted cranberry scented candle
this was also really really delicious
smelling um the actual fragrance is ripe
red cranberries dusted with fresh snow
and a blend of juicy peach raspberry and
vanilla also delicious I also really
like that I have a Johnson's baby
bedtime bath clinically proven to help
baby sleep better um bubble bath this
smells so good it's like a sweet
lavender like candy lavender and no I
don't have a baby I use this for myself
I love taking baths and this stuff is
amazing I highly recommend trying this
fragrance out um I have a bath and body
works deep cleansing hand soap in mixed
berry tart this smells really really
good and it said it is a delicious red
berry tart with orange zest and powdered
sugar I loved that I have another deep
cleansing cancelled from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works this one is iced gingerbread this
was also really really nice it smelled
just like gingerbread cookies so I
really liked that one um I went through
some yuck i don't know what's on there
it must be so some of these studio 35
beauty cleansing towelettes for
sensitive skin pre-moistened facial
wipes I like to these a lot these were
for removing my makeup
I do stuff the bath and body works
eucalyptus spearmint luxury bath um it
says we Laxmi think clearly um this
smell oh so good you guys I highly
recommend this luxury bath stuff you
like pour it in your bath and it's like
this creamy wonderful product it just
it's so relaxing and it smells so good
that you slipped experiment is really
great another three with handle from
Bath and Body Works a lot about the body
work stuff um Hot Buttered Rum this
smelt too good I wanted to eat it um it
says the scent is a blend of buttered
rum vanilla and a hint of smooth caramel
that's perfect for a cold winter's night
love that I just have to say I love the
way these candles burn do you guys see
how even that is I was really angry the
other day um well no when I was visiting
my boyfriend i was using up some of the
yankee candles there and they just don't
burn evenly and its really annoying they
like burn around it and then the wax
gets all over the jar and it was just it
was annoying i did not like that i I
don't remember meant anyway let's move
on I wanted to show this because I have
issues sleeping and I wanted to share a
product that really really works for me
um to help go to sleep this ah extra
strange liquid men of melatonin in 1
tablespoon it has five milligrams of
melatonin if you can't sleep at night I
highly recommend picking it up because
it really really works I'm going to put
that down because I feel like it's
making my lighting kind of weird I'm
filming this in weird lighting I have
unnatural lighting and I have natural
lighting and they're kind of like mixing
together and doing a birthday anyway
next I used up the intensive repair deep
treatment mask from dub this was really
really nice I did like it I would
repurchase i also used up a bath and
Bodyworks fresh pics sweet tangerines
deep cleansing hand soap delicious would
repurchase um the glam glow thirsty
cleanse cleanser I used up this I would
definitely repurchase I loved this um
I I mean I didn't even purchase this
this is actually a sample but I would
purchase a full sizethis I did like it
that much um the neutrogena triple
moisture deep recovery hair mask loved
this would definitely repurchase it
smells amazing it's just it smells like
no other hair mask it's so good actually
brings me back to like when I was in
eighth or ninth grade when this product
first came out like it just reminds me I
used up some baby wipes I use these why
not doing swatches when I'm doing my
makeup and I want to wipe my hands these
other natural care organic cotton soft
and strong they have a really
interesting fragrance so it was it was
whatever um they were good and I would
repurchase the l'oreal revitalift
radiant smoothing wet cleansing
towelettes I like to be a lot to remove
my makeup however they are expensive I
don't know if I would repurchase I might
um the Sephora honey I'm asked amazing
would definitely repurchase loved this
love it um more baby wipes wipes these
are the pampers sensitive these are my
favorite ones that I like to use um some
makeup remover towelettes the night
calming one these are the studio 35
beauty this is the walgreens like
compared to brand like those a lot a
prada candy floral sample this was
pretty good I know everybody raves about
proud of candy like the fragrance um I
am NOT like a huge fan of that however
this can do the floral or the floral one
was really nice I used up he Rock daily
resurfacing discs these were really
awesome the only reason I would not be
purchased because I found that they were
a hassle in the shower to open them up
take a pad out i was worried i get water
in the container so I don't know if I
would repurchase these but if you're one
of those people that washes your face
like outside of the shower like at the
actual sink then you might want to try
these out they're really good for acne
and also anti-aging okay um the Dr Lin
daily hydrating
Susan rehydrates dry irritated skin with
hyaluronic acid plus aloe vera highly
recommend this stuff is amazing um it
was like this really really clear thin
consistency gel that was just great I
absolutely loved it highly highly
recommend getting this if you are acne
prone or if you have sensitive skin and
need a nice light daily moisturizer that
will also help um you know like inflamed
skin really good I'm gonna have so much
trash on my bed gross I used up the
downy unstoppables in wash sent booster

night time sent like I washed my sheets
with it or like my towels and just made
me want to go to bed it's not so good
love it um the Mario Badescu enzyme

love mask I would definitely repurchase
this however I have a lot of different
masks that I could currently go through
um if you guys have seen like my
skincare a little pullout mirror in the
bathroom I have like a whole tour on
that I have a lot of product so I
definitely do not necessarily need to
repurchase this right away but i would
definitely repurchase all right oh my
god I have so many empties for the crap
I used up the yes to cucumbers soothing
hypoallergenic facial towelettes I liked
these a lot I would definitely pick
those up again the Aussie three minute
miracle color also liked this would
definitely repurchase the Garnier if
you're wondering why it looks so short
and stumpy us because I cut it open to
get all of the product out this is the
Garnier clean plus makeup removing
lotion cleanser for sensitive skin with
Moringa loved this would definitely
repurchase however I find it easier to
use makeup um like removing towelettes
rather than like an actual cleanser and
then i have to wreak lens my skin so
some more pampers sensitive baby wipes

can't live without the Evian facial
spray moisturizes refreshes tones loved
it I use it to set my makeup really
really good um the Garnier skin renew

huge tub of it for 1599 at Ulta and I'm
kind of bummed out because I don't like
it as much as this one and it's huge
like the thing is like a leader so it's
gonna take me forever to go through um
two more of the batiste dry shampoos one
in sassy and daring and one in Savannah
Savannah smells so good i wish they
would make this like a i know it's like
a limited edition kit but i wish they
would come out with this one in like a
full size because the scent was amazing
it's not like a high-end perfume another
bite batiste dry shampoo in like tanned
blonde this is nice if you do have
blonde hair and you don't want your
roots showing this puts on a little
color at the top very nice um the Khloe
love story the smelt okay little sample

keep this on my lap now is there's so
much tiny stuff here the elf makeup mist

henriksen ultimate lift I gel I like
that a lot not enough to purchase a big
size though the dr dennis gross alpha
beta peel extra strength formula step
one surface refiner and stuck to the
deeper treatment I like this but I think
the peter thomas roth discs which i use
on a daily basis are better and they're
much cheaper than a set of those the ban
refresh wipes i love the scent of this
and i just love using these after i work
out or if I'm sweating um the fresh rose

anything with Rosen it if you know I
feel that it's very very um hydrating
and calming on my skin the Lancome

this um the Clinique acne solutions
clinical clearing gel I already did
purchase a both sides of that because I
did like it so much the soap &amp;amp; Glory

go through them are like that i used up
the josie maran whipped argan oil and be
joyful vanilla apricot it's lovely
lovely something kind of an oily product

here are four of them I use those in
every single room in my apartment I have

cargo liquid liner in black you've dried
out way too quickly I would not
repurchase the renewed hope in a jar
from philosophy moisturizer I liked this

more like a clean than a moisturizer
