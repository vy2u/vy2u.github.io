hope you guys are having a great day
looks like I got some dry shampoo like
white mark of dry shampoo right there
didn't rub it in properly sorry about
that
anyway today's video it's going to be
empties for the month of July so July
2015
empties I have a lot this is my little
plastic bag that says empties July 2015
and I'm gonna be sharing um the products
that I used up for this month with you
guys so let's get started the first
thing I used up was two boxes of hair
tie um whoops
oops my empties are following two boxes
of hair and I this is from Revlon color
so this is my favorite at home here a
diet system so I used to have two boxes
because I'm not because my hair is super
thick but because it is very long so um
the color I used up with oh three ultra
light Sun blonde they really liked that
so happy with that um next I used up
let's see yeah a thing oh this is kind
of funny um so I used up a poo pourri
thing and yes you guys are probably like
what the hell
yes poo pourri it looks like this you
spray it in like toilet bowl before you
go it says spritz the bowl before you go
and no one else will ever know it
seriously works and yeah I don't really
have anything else to say about that it
works um I used two packets of baby
wipes from Walmart these were nice but
they're not my favorite I've used up a
sample of the benefit puff off which is
oh did you see that I just thought with
eating a bunch of three those people um
the benefit pop off which is like a
instant eye gel to help smooth the look
of puppies and I really really like this
so I think I might actually pick this
product up but it was just like a little
sample like the little slighty thing
that you peel off and you use it so I
really really like that though next I'm
used up a gentle foaming hand soap from
Bath and Body Works this is the pink
peonies and pear
I like to just a lot my favorite flower
if peonies and I love the scent of pears
so I knew I would like this um I
normally my boyfriend and I prefer the
deep cleansing hand soap version or
formula from Bath and Body Works but
this gentle foaming was a nice change so
really really liked back next I used up
a mouthwash this is the naturally
friendly hello mouthwash in super mint
it's in really really cute little
packaging and I tried this out because I
originally have tried out the pink one I
think it was like spearmint grapefruit
or something like that and it was really
really gross I did not like it
um but I picked up this one just because
I'm drawn in by the packaging I thought
it was so cute
so I ended up picking this one up and I
actually really really like this so I do
like the formula it is really nice
because it has no alcohol dyes or
artificial sweeteners and it has xylitol
in it which it's really nice if you have
dry mouth I take medications that give
me dry mouth so this is really really
nice and yeah so it cleans freshens and
it's delicious and this one really
tasted good so I think the one before
like the pink one um I just didn't like
the taste of it so that's why I thought
oh I just don't like the whole thing or
any of them but I did like this one so I
would repurchase in this particular um
taste formula set um next I used up a
toner that I absolutely loved which is
awesome because I don't find toners that
I love every single like it's not every
day that you find a toner you're in love
with but this is the kouachi pure and
clean revitalizing face toner with aloe
vera chamomile and calendula at
calendula and I absolutely love this it
was like bright pink and I think he can
get this full-size for like six dollars
I got this in one of my glossy boxes and
I'm telling you I absolutely love it
it's great for the morning it's one of
those toners it just feels really good
it smells amazing it smells like peach
water like peaches and water mixed
together it's really really sweet
smelling pretty because it's pink
and it just works really well so I
really really liked that I would
repurchase
next I used up a detangler this is the
Dove Hair Therapy of nourishing oil care
nutritive solutions detangler with
weightless Argan oils argan oil blend it
says it lightly conditions for smooth
manageable hair I liked this a lot this
is really nice for well for me
personally I wash my hair every other
day so every other day um on date where
it's really dirty I have my hair up and
normally I used like you know hair
sprays and stuff like that it's really
tough to brush my hair out that night
before I get in the shower so I really
liked this one because it does have that
extra extra like a nutritive solution in
it those extra oils so it really brushes
out nicely um I did find that if I use
this on the days where I'm wearing my
hair down it looks a little oily because
I do have fine here but I love it for
the days where I'm brushing it out
before going in the shower so I did like
that and I would possibly probably
repurchase it there's a lot of
detanglers out there though um I used up
this little packet of facial radiance
pads from first date Beauty it they
exfoliate tone and brighten their
alcohol free and safe for sensitive skin
I really really like these they kind of
remind me of like the Peter Thomas Roth
spiel pads which are my favorite I would
repurchase those before I got these
except they don't have all those like
acids like glycolic acid and like AJ the
PHAs that are going to irritate your
skin so you can use these in the morning
and I like the thought that like it
exfoliates tones and brightens so it's
kind of like a one step and go sort of
things so I did like these I might
purchase these to have in the morning I
use the retinol or not the retinol the
Peter Thomas Roth peel pads at nighttime
so I thought that maybe these would be
nice for the morning um next I used a
fake bubble bath this is from Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works this is the be enchanted
bubble bath from the Signature
Collection it says it is a generously
infused with the enchanted a fresh
sparkling blend of ice pomegranate and
sugared petals inspired by all that
glitters so it smells really really good
it's a really cute little bottle I like
the design on the front and it smells
really good it smells like berries and
just like sweetness so it was really
nice and I like
the summertime I just thought that it
really I don't know I feel like this
during the winter and during the
summertime is nice it has a very sweet
scent so yeah moving on I've used up
this little um the little small size of
the boscia makeup breakup cool cleansing
oil I absolutely love this this is what
I use to remove my makeup at night now I
do alternate with like you know
cleansing wipes and things like that cuz
I do you like those also but this is the
one that really really I have the
full-size now this is the one that
really really I feel like doesn't tug at
my skin and if I have time at nighttime
to go through the process of using it
that's what I use so really really love
that obviously when I travel and stuff I
take makeup removing wipes because it's
just so easy and sometimes if I'm in a
hurry at nighttime I will use like
micellar water um but I really really
like the book shop so that's my go-to
makeup remover next I used up the Dove
dry spray this is a deodorant dry spray
I am in love with this I just got into
using like deodorant dry sprays there's
so much better they leave absolutely no
white mark underneath your arm and they
dry instantly so they're awesome and
they smell good this is the Dove dry
spray clear tone it helps restore skin
to its natural tone I didn't notice any
difference um I don't personally have
like dark discoloration in my armpits
but I know some people do but it's
really nice this was 48-hour
anti-perspirant non-irritant and you
know you just shake well before use and
then spray it on and it's awesome and
you just get no white marks that's what
I look for in a deodorant and yeah so
really do they love the active one I
already purchased another one like that
cucumber scent it's really nice very
fresh um I went through a bag of the
cotton squares padded from up enough
this is the compareto brand at Target
these were kind of nice they were a
little thin I prefer them a little more
quilted um and I'll show you the ones I
did prefer these were the cotton ovals
from up and up and these are dual sided
so you have one site that's really soft
and one that's a little more
textured and these were thicker so I
preferred these um I used up a deep
conditioner that I actually used to hate
so this I had gone through one of these
before and it was like a product I would
never repurchase however since I have
been coloring my hair when I started my
channel I had virgin hair I had changed
when I had about three years ago now and
I grew my hair on all virgin no
colouring you know just my natural color
and um it's just interesting to see how
different it is when you start to color
your hair how much like more rough the
cuticle becomes and you need certain
products when I'm used to this when I
had virgin hair it was so heavy it
weighed down my hair it looked really
however now it works really really well
in my hair so I like it a lot now it is
the Garnier Fructis damage eraser
strength reconstructing butter it's
smells amazing and I just think it's
really really good so um you know it is
literally like butter it's super thick
but you basically just use it as they
leave in treatment or you can use it I
like I said I color my hair so sometimes
I do use deep conditioners as my
everyday conditioner so anyway love that
now and I used up the Clinique Moisture
Surge extended thirst relief gel creme
this is a moisturizer it's very very
nice it's like a light pink and it's
very nice for a sensitive skin it really
gives a lot of moisture into the skin
and it is like a gel so it really feels
nice and refreshing on your skin during
the summer time so I definitely would
repurchase I have a lot of moisturizers
to go through so probably not anytime
soon but I would repurchase this product
um they used of a sample of at the Marc
Jacobs modern war from Sephora this
smells pretty darn good I'm actually
really thinking about going in and
purchasing the full size of this I think
it's like a limited edition so I
probably need to get on that pretty
quickly but you guys know I have a lot
of perfumes I probably shouldn't buy
this but I might because it really does
smell good um I used up the bath and
Bodyworks aromatherapy boost tangelo or
tangle oh I think it's tangelo tangelo
woods body wash and foam bath it says
lift your spirits with Mandarin and
bergamot essential oil
they help lift your mood and invigorate
your mind this was awesome it really did
exactly that I felt so good when I used
it I never used it really as a body wash
it does work as a body wash but oh my
god it smells so good but I mostly used
it as a bubble bath and I loved it as a
bubble bath or a phone bath or whatever
so love that great scent if you love
citrus scents you will love this I used
up a little dual pack of the Colgate
wisp Maxx fresh clean and freshens
peppermint four brushes with beads these
are really nice to have like in your
purse if you need to like quickly dee
gunk your teeth or brush them in the car
or something these are great so I really
like those they were really really minty
though I might not go with the max fresh
ones next time I might just go with the
regular one
whoo those were so minty I was like oh
my gosh my mouth's on fire and I can
handle a lot of spice so um I used up at
the dry bar original formulas sake bomb
nourishing shampoo this was pretty nice
I really started to like the scent the
more I've used it um it's like the
signature scent that driver has it kind
of smells like cardamom to me but
overall it was good it wasn't anything
super special but I did enjoy its scent
and it lasted quite a long time um next
I used to have a plastic bag I used up a
sample of the dr. Brandt needles no more
I have used this before I have purchased
a full-size and used it I think it does
work it doesn't work amazingly but it
does help to diminish fine lines like
for an everyday kind of thing you
probably don't want to wear it at
nighttime which is what I did I found
that it was more one of those instant
kind of things like over time it didn't
really do anything for my fine lines but
um I think if you wear it during the
daytime it can help mask any deep lines
or fine lines that you have so it's good
if I purchase another one I'll be using
it during the day not at night I went
through these Jurlique rose water
balancing mist this was amazing I would
definitely repurchase I'm so into like
balancing mist and mist of all kind
right now so this was great it's a
hydrating mist and it just smelled
amazing it smells so much like rose so
if you
do not like the scent of rose this is
like super super Rose like rose on
steroids so definitely don't get it if
you are not into the scent of rose but
it was wonderful and I would definitely
repurchase um I used up the bozo
detoxifying black cleanser this was
really really nice I liked it a lot if
you have oily skin I highly recommend
looking into the Boscia black like
cleanser and black moisturizer the poor
strips all that stuff if you have oily
acne prone skin this would be really
really good for you but this was nice it
was warming so you rub it together and
it starts to warm like on your face just
feels really good so I really like that
and it did kind of decongest my skin so
that it's great um I used up a small
little Trentham a platinum strength
strengthening shampoo I liked this a lot
this lather is really well it makes my
hair feel really nice and it smells
really good so so I mean I would
definitely purchase a full-size of this
however I have so much crap to go
through I mean that crap with so many
like shampoos and conditioners so I
don't know when that will happen but I
would definitely consider purchasing a
false ID to that and Tresemme is really
well priced too so that's great get a
lot of bang for your buck I opened this
stuff cut it open so I could get
everything out of it this is the living
proof um no frizz nourishing styling
creme styling cream it stops for his
period weightless sleep blocks humidity
smooth sand conditions and no heavy
silicones or oils I've used this thing
up I loved it this was great this is a
great nourishing product it really helps
moisturize your hair but also it styles
it because it helps with frizz so really
really liked that um I do not like this
which is surprising because my favorite
brand is two-faced and I like to say
that I love everything from the brand
but the new Born This Way Foundation I
got a little sample of it from Sephora
this did not work for me this emphasize
my pores it made me look worse like it
made my skin just look worse like
emphasize the dry patches emphasize
oiliness texture on my skin it just
looked horrible so it says it's absolute
perfection foundation and oil free but I
did not feel that way to be fair if this
was a shade that was a bit too dark for
me this is in vanilla but I only
at once and I'm not gonna use the rest
I'm tossing it because I'm so
uninterested I really do not like it so
would not repurchase or purchase the
full side of it and I used up my bozhe
Kong Jack or cognac whatever is sponge I
really really like this for the morning
you know just it's just it's it's great
you know it's not as great as like I
mean I personally I think that you could
you know substitute this for like a
Clarisonic um at nighttime I really like
a deep cleanse so I use my Clarisonic
but this is great in the morning so I'm
gonna leave that out so I remember to
order another one because I've been
missing it and then I used up a little
mini glam glow mask this is the youth
mud tingle exfoliate treatment this is
my favorite favorite
glam glow mask that they have so look
this really used it up it smells amazing
really really exfoliates your skin it's
wonderful it smells so good you need to
make like a perfume of that of all their
masks all their masks smell great but
anyway really enjoyed that would
repurchase we're getting towards the
bottom here guys I've used up a little
sample of the Porefessional I love it I
mean I have a full-size and all that
stuff but I just had a sample it's great
another one of the pop off from benefit
like I said really into this I might
have to go and pick this up actually
it's got kind of like a pink tint so it
really kind of brightens underneath the
eyes just felt great um this little
thing in here had this was a sample from
Sephora and it had the purity cleanser
from philosophy in here um good cleanser
I'm really surprised because when I
smelled it I was like is this the purity
cleanser like everybody talks about I
embrace about it but the scent is very
like herbal E and any time I think of
philosophy I think of like sweet scents
so I just did not think of this being
that product if that makes sense like I
did not think of it being that brand um
but it is nice it really really kind of
cleans your face the way like an
exfoliator does like a scrub does so I
can see why people really like it um I
again another needles no more
sample good it's good and then I used up
the chorus or pores step 1 and step 2
activating peel gel this is the wild
rose vitamin C petal peel so the first
step had 10% AHS and soothing aloe and
the first one is an activating peel gel
and then you have the brightening and
resurfacing peel mask this was like a
very very nice alternative to peels like
if you are very sensitive to peels and
like glycolic acid and AAS this is a
good alternative for you it doesn't
tingle it doesn't hurt it doesn't leave
your skin red so yeah very very nice if
you have sensitive skin and yeah I think
that's it we went through all my updates
for the month so I hope you guys enjoyed
