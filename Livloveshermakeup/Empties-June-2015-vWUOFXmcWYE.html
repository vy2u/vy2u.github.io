thank you so much for joining me I just
want to say right away if you guys hear
loud noises coming from downstairs we
are having construction done in our
cabin
so those adalat noses that you are
hearing but anyway today I am filming my
empties video for the month of June so
this is June 2015 empties so let's just
get right into it the first thing I went
through was the all small and mighty
with stain lifters free and clear
laundry detergent it is free and clear
of perfumes and dyes and the reason I
like using laundry detergent like this
is because I really really really like
to use scent boosters in my laundry um
and so I noticed that if I use something
that's free of perfumes and clear of
dyes I get the most out of my scent
boosters so that is why I like to use
nothing like this um excuse me it was
really nice it did get rid of stains and
also I noticed that you know it really
let the scent of my scent boosters come
through so really really liked that the
next thing is another always stain
lifters free and clear this is just a
bigger size so basically I just went
through two of those and I really really
liked those I would definitely
repurchase and next I went through a
dove intensive repair deep treatment
mask with keratin repair actives I have
repurchased this probably this is
probably my fifth time repurchasing it
so I really really like this product
it's really really great for the hair it
smells like coconut and it just really
makes the hair nice and soft and smooth
so I would definitely even purchase that
too I went through a Betty stay or
batiste dry shampoo I went through the
floral and flirty blush scent I cannot
live without dry shampoo I love the
batiste or but taste however you say it
I want as they line I think they're
really really great so they don't leave
a lot of residue in my hair and it just
doesn't feel like it's heavy and crunchy
and gross so I really really like this
would definitely repurchase that scent
was pretty nice it was like a little bit
florally a little bit sweet so it was
very nice I went to a bath and Bodyworks
gelato small candle I really really
loved this scent however this did not
burn evenly at all so not very happy
with that
I would repurchase in the three wix4 I
went through the unwashed bio cleansing
conditioner it says it replaced the
shampoo locks and natural oils and color
free of harsh sulfates and parabens and
moisturizing and a non strip cleanser
and I liked this however it was not
cleansing enough to use just as they
shampoo for me so what I like to do is
use my shampoo and then use this it just
helped to get like tangles out and I
just massaged it everywhere from my
scalp all the way to my ends and I
really did like it so I would repurchase
next I used up the instant healthy hair
treatment from 12 benefits it says it
seals color smooth repairs improves
texture manageability strengthens
protects from the Sun all that kind of
stuff this is really nice there reminds
me a lot of the what are those called
eight to ten like spray leave ins it was
kind of like a thick spray and you could
work it in all over your hair and it was
really really nice so I would repurchase
that however I have like three full
sizes of the it's a ten I have to go
through so probably not anytime soon
outer fridges I used up two of the glam
glow masks that I would definitely
repurchase these are the little tiny
sizes I used up the thirsty mud which is
the hydrating treatment and I also used
up the dual cleanse which is power mud
so love those a lot I used up a cherry
blossom sangria scented candle this
isn't a little mini mason jar I'm gonna
reuse this mason jar from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works this was the great scent I really
really like did that one burn evenly so
I was very happy I used up the healthy
sexy hair sexy hair soy tri wheat leavin
spray looks like that it was really
really nice it you know really did kind
of condition my ends if you're someone
who doesn't want to bother using like
creams and things like that to seal in
your ends and whatnot after you've
showered this is a really really nice
alternative like a spray it's very very
clear I used up on a package of Pampers
baby wipes this is in the baby fresh
scent I use these to remove makeup for
my hands
when I'm doing my makeup and also just
swatches things like that I used up a
shower cap with this pink one it started
to get holes in it and it got really
dirty I used another thing a baby wipes
can see well beginnings green tea a few
number of wipes
I like these I really like the green tea
&amp;amp; cucumber scent however I like the
campus ones better in that scent
um I used FA Fox Abhishek intuition pure
nourishment moisturizing ribbons coconut
milk and almond oil cartridges these are
razor refills cartridges really really
like these I love these Schick intuition
it has like completely changed my life
best razor ever so these are the
cartridges that I use with that I used
up a pack of the BAM total Refresh
cooling body cloths I really like these
after I workout or if I'm just not in
the mood to shower and I've gotten
sweaty throughout the day just white
sleeves all over they're really nice I
used up the Kate Somerville nourished
hydrating firming mist I did not notice
that this burned my skin however um from
my skin I didn't notice that I had any
firming properties to it however it was
really nice and refreshing
I love little mist like that I used up
the I co skinny mini liquid eyeliner in
black this actually just dried out I
never even really used it it looked like
it would have been nice but it dried out
so that's too bad um I used up the
bumble and bumble a hairdressers
invisible oil sulfate free shampoo I
actually really like this a lot this was
really really nice I would definitely
consider getting a full size of that it
lab was nicely it smells good and it
really made my hair feel nice and
nourished and strong I went through the
uLTA Beauty smoothie dragon fruit frappe
three-in-one shower gel bubble bath and
shampoo I used it as mostly a shower gel
and a shampoo I didn't really love it
that much at the shampoo of probably
wouldn't use it but if you are traveling
to have like something like this all
three you know in one little thing is
great because you can use it as a shower
gel up ofafghanistan boo um but as the
shower gel was really nice it was pretty
good as the bubble bath but as a shampoo
it just didn't lather the way I like I
love really really shampoos that lather
a lot so that's just my personal
preference if you guys know
any really amazing shampoos that lather
like a ton please leave them below I
would love to know I went through a
glide Pro health comfort plus floss I
went through some makeup wipes these are
from Walmart's there were 40 in here and
these were under $5 it's a great deal
this is the compared to Neutrogena night
call me cleansing towelettes this is the
nighttime soothing makeup remover
towelettes these were really really nice
liked them a lot and again 40 in here
for under $5 is incredible really likes
that if used up another band refreshed
cooling body class this is just in a
different scent I used up the Harmon
face values compared to Neutrogena
makeup remover cleansing towelettes
these are really nice they were very
very soft this is the bed bath and
beyond
compared to version the Harmon and these
were really soft and smelled really nice
I've used up a Garnier Fructis damage
eraser heal and sealed treatment it's a
60 second rinse out really really like
this I love the scent and it kind of
left like a slimy texture on my ends
however it really was easy to like work
through any tangles so really like that
another AB and total refreshed cooling
body class love those a lot that one's
in a different sense also and then I
used up three total mouth I have them in
a plastic J they were really kind of
yucky three wallflowers so that with my
empty before the month of June June June
