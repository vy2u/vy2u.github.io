hope you guys are having a great day
please excuse all the boxes and bins
behind me I will be moving in two days
so I'm just you know putting the final
touches on packing everything up and
yeah so anyway today's video is going to
be at my empties for the month of May so
let's get started
I have everything in this big wholefoods
bag and like usual so let's get started
the first thing I went through was the
downy UNSTOPABLES
in the fragrance shimmer these are eight
in scent in egg wash scent boosters in
scent booster washes no in wash scent
boosters and what you do is you put
about a capful or maybe half a capsule
goes into basically you put it into the
washer before you put your clothes in
and then you put your clothes in and
then it just leaves your clothes
smelling really really good so this
particular scent was really nice and
kind of floral e it kind of just I don't
know I really liked it was really nice
so this is these shimmer scent this is
one of Emilie Noelle's 83 her husband
loves this scent and I really like you
too that's really good
he always raised about that and we I was
thought it was funny because he's such a
big like manly man and he loves this
little pink shimmer fragrance anyway so
moving on another laundry product is the
Fosca perfect scent free laundry
detergent the reason I like this was
because I have no added sect in there so
I could use any of my downy UNSTOPABLES
in wash scent boosters and it wouldn't
disturb the fragrance so I really really
liked this just because you know it
didn't smell like anything so it really
liked the I cannot say this in washtech
boosters in wash that boosters it really
lucky in wash them boosters smell
everything up really nicely itself next
I went through these simple cleansing
micellar water it's as it cleanses
removes makeup and hydrate I have been
loving micellar waters lately I like to
use them to clean my face in the morning
if I I'm just lazy and I can't be
bothered to do it but also I like to
them to remove excess makeup in the
morning for my eyes I do not find that
it removes makeup well just by itself
like if you're going to you know really
want to use this to remove all your
makeup at night it's probably not going
to be that good at doing that it's just
not strong enough but if you use like a
wipe and then you want to go over with
this it's really nice for that also so
love that simple cleansing micellar
water I would definitely go back to this
particular one but right now I'm using
the one from Sephora I think uh like
carton of it it's for the next two so
anyway continuing on I used up the about
the Body Works peach Bellini deep
cleansing hand soap really nice scent I
don't know what happened to the little
pot I hum but the scent is a delicious
twist of juicy peach like apricot and
fresh mango so I'm sure you can imagine
how good that smells
who doesn't like peach apricot and may
go together
YUM so that was really really good um
it's my favorite formula the deep
cleansing I really feel like it um
cleans my hands really well I went
through these whispers hundred percent
cotton nail polish remover squares and I
actually did not use these for nail
polish I'm sure at some point during the
month I did however I used these instead
for eye makeup removal they're so soft
they're really really quilted nicely and
they were just really gentle on the eye
area so I liked those ones a lot next I
used up ace whispers facial cleansing
pad these are like big big oval not oval
but circular excuse me circular like
discs and they were just really really
nice um they put everything I can get my
whole face with just that pad like when
I'm using toner I can use literally just
one pad and go over Michael on terror
face which is really really nice so
definitely would repurchase those next I
have another downy UNSTOPABLES in
washstand booster set it right this time
this has been the fragrance spring and
this one is a little more like fresh
smelling I would say this one's a lot
more fresh smelling than the shimmer one
shimmer one's a little more soft and
florally this one's a little more fresh
I prefer the shimmer one so I don't know
if I would repurchase the other one but
it should be nice you know I mean they
all smell really good there's not one
that like tops all of them like all the
others they're all really good good well
I just that call like 25 times anyway
moving on I went through this rituals
yogi slow Indian Rose and sweet almond
oil so'ming shower gel it looked like
this I think I got this in a glossy box
I loved it it really smelled nice and
smell very natural it wasn't like a
fruity or floral kind of fragrance it
was a very natural fragrance but it was
very very nice and I liked that it
foamed up it was kind of a different
sensation of using a body wash so I did
like that quite a few baby wipes packets
you guys know I wipe my hands with baby
wipes while I'm doing my makeup and just
all the time to clean my hands so this
is one of my favorites you cookies
cucumber and green tea this one has the
frozen characters on it and again this
one is the same way I think so yeah this
is the green tea and yeah cucumber green
tea this is a great fragrance it's so
fresh and so clean next I used up soon
thin that I'll ask them next I used up
some makeup remover wipes um this one I
really liked this was the Harmon face
values compared to Neutrogena makeup
remover cleansing towelettes in the
night calling scent this is the makeup
remover cleansing towelettes nighttime
it says it nourishes and calms with
camomile green tea and aloe I get these
at Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond and again these are
that compared to the Neutrogena ones and
they were just really really soft and
nice and really removed my makeup well
and then these are the cleaning clear
night relaxing all-in-one cleansing
wipes I got these because mama loves
mascara here on YouTube recommended
these and I love watching her videos and
they did smell very nice however they
just weren't as like soft as I had
imagined so I probably won't repurchase
but still they didn't smell very very
good and they do remove makeup off next
I went through this crest ProHealth
clinical gum protection invigorating
clean mint
toothpaste this was an amazing
toothpaste this particular sentir the
invigorating mint is smells amazing and
tastes amazing so I would definitely
repurchase this I went through the bath
&amp;amp; Bodyworks aromatherapy energy body
wash body wash body wash hello
body wash the about the body works
aromatherapy energy body wash and foam
back this scent is in bergamot coriander
and this is amazing this is like old
school Bath and Body Works like I feel
like a woman when I'm using these they
don't feel like a little girl like I
love like all the scents at Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works don't get me wrong but this is
like very like I don't know like more
mature and just like how I feel like old
school Bath &amp;amp; Body Works scents used to
smell like
so this bergamot coriander is beautiful
it's really beautiful I did not use it
as a body wash but I did use it as a
foam bath or as a bubble bath and it
really uh you know gave a lot of bubbles
and was really nice it seems like it
lathers up really well so I'm sure it
would also be a good body wash next I
used up these makeup remover wipes this
is the appo Botanica abou Botanica
Hawaiian three-in-one cleansing
towelettes deep pore purifying pineapple
eye enzyme three-in-one makeup remover
cleanser and toner I did not really like
these they actually left my skin a
little irritated and also they just were
not soft enough thick enough and they
also just we didn't feel like they
remove my makeup that well so I don't
know I would not repurchase these I
don't really recommend these they did
smell kind of good but again not great
smelling so would not purchase
repurchase those but it was worth trying
I went through a Sephora jelly mask
moisturizing and energizing they come in
these little like cubes and it's just a
jelly mask you can store it in the
refrigerator and put it on you know
clean skin or you can just put it on
without putting in the refrigerator it's
really really nice it really just kind
of moisturizes my skin and I felt really
really soothing on the skin especially
when it gets hot out it's nice to put
something cooling on and I think like
gels do a good job of that
next I used up the deep cleansing hand
soap from Bath and Body Works this is
brown sugar and carrots it looks like
this and they scent is a unique blend of
glazed carrots creamy vanilla and sweet
cinnamon it actually smells like I don't
know like a cinnamon cookie or something
like it it's not very um a wintertime
kind of smelling of that make sense I
think it's the cinnamon and the vanilla
in there they're kind of but I don't
know I kind of thought I was gonna use
this in my kitchen and then I ended up
using it in my bathroom because it was
so like a warm smelly so used to that
out but did like that next I used up the
L'Oreal power moisture moisture rush
mask with hyaluronic acid it gives up to
10 times more moisture I really like
this this is really nice if you have
fine hair and you want a mask that's not
gonna weigh your hair down this is
actually like a gel consistency so it's
not like a heavy butter that you're
putting all over your hair and it really
is just very very nice so highly
recommend that one from L'Oreal I would
repurchase I used up another Sephora
jelly masked moisturizing and energizing
little actually is the one I did earlier
No yeah I must have used up too already
so another one of the jelly masks
moisturizing and energizing little
cocktail that says cocktail of vitamins
for your face kind of cute I've used up
the summer's eve morning paradise
cleansing wash for sensitive skin this
is for cleaning down there got to keep
that area clean ladies highly recommend
this it's pH balanced and it never
irritates me down there even if you know
I've been waxing or shaving or something
it never stings or anything like that so
this is really good this particular said
just sounds like I'm not orange like
oranges kind of like orange juice it was
really nice I like that one my favorite
one is definitely still the pink one I
know it can be so good here next I used
up the organics hydrating macadamia oil
intense moisture mask it says ultra
moisturizing treatment infused with
macadamia oil to hydrate dry hair while
exotic sugarcane extra and bamboo
extract have helped split ends help
Metasploit ends help men split ends so
that's what it looked like this was
really really nice it smelt beautiful I
felt like it really did a good job of
moisturizer
and yeah so I would definitely
repurchase that I think I got it on sale
at Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond for maybe like
three dollars so that was a steal I used
up the Neutrogena oil-free acne stress
control night cleansing pads these have
2% salicylic acid in them these are
really really nice for breakouts as you
can see they were very well loved I
definitely used all of those that house
they're really really strong like
cucumber II kind of fragrance and it
just it's almost overwhelming it kind of
smells like cucumber and alcohol mixed
together however it really does help
heal up any kind of blemishes you may
have I'm sad that I'm out because I
would like to wiper on it with
wipe on it with I would like to like one
of these on it anyway so I love those
those are really nice I have a dis
invigorating foot sockies these are
spearmint and tea tree oil who you will
love them it says I got this from my
quote look I let my mom actually use
this she really liked it she thought
that it really moisturized her feet she
has bad feet because she is a former
ballerina so I've seen her kind of
misshapen
misshapen they're just they're not as
lovely as normal feet
normally look I guess you could say so
she has some issues with bone spurs and
things like that so she really liked
that that felt good on her feet next I
used up the rich pure luxury intense
moisture shampoo this is hydration
intense shampoo this was great I got
this at one of my glossy boxes I think
not a long while ago one while ago I
really can't talk today I'm just kind of
it smells really really good it was
really really moisturizing I would
definitely pick this up I don't know
I've never seen this brand if you guys
ever seen this brand around I'm pretty
sure keen in my glossy box maybe I'll go
onto the glossy box website but anyway
this was great really really liked that
shampoo
I used the Drybar nourishing hair mask
this is the mudslide nourishing hair
mask I cut it open so I could get
everything out it smells kind of good
it had like an interesting kind of spicy
scent to it and it said is they deeply
moisturizing mask to help strengthen dry
damaged hair it was just okay I would
not repurchase it didn't really impress
me that much something that did impress
me from Drybar you it's got stuff all
over it but this is the original formula
formula sake bomb nourishing conditioner
this was really nice it really acted
kind of like a deep conditioner I really
liked it I kinda had that kind of
interesting Drive our smell I've used up
a the first step of the Clinique liquid
facial soap cleanser system I've used
this three-step before but this was just
a little Sam goal trying to get through
all my samples I have a huge box of
samples maybe I need to designate a
month of this coming year to just using
samples not quite sure if that would be
good for my skin but I really need to
get through those so you know this is
definitely more to what opens I've been
dying all over this this is the alluring
Nicollet a mask with papaya aloe and
vitamin C my mom used this she said it
was really nice with me moisturizing I
don't know what's on there you know what
oh it's the hand soap that this one this
must have come out a little bit yeah you
can see at the top it did but she really
liked this this was a mask for your date
for the day which is kind of cool
because I always find that you know
people take good care of their skin on
their face sometimes but what usually
gives away their age is their neck or
their chest so you want to make sure
that you're taking care of the neck the
chest and the face so those little masks
for the day cleanse hair very nice I
used up the essence all about max 16
compact powder this was just a matte
pressed powder it just was like white
and translucent really really nice happy
that I hit some pan on or not hit pan
but actually used up some makeup this
month I have a lot of it another makeup
item that I used up was the elf tone
correcting powder and cool one of my
favorites completely used that up really
we love this powder it's amazing trying
to branch out and try new things because
it's give me that had been a favorite of
mine forever but I really want to try
some difference back to you so much
makeup I used up at the bathroom body
works pocket back Hawaiian pink hibiscus
antibacterial hand gel smelled really
really good it just is really really
fresh selling and I love the size of
these they're so easy to pop in your bag
or your purse love to this this is the
garden me a clean class blackhead
eliminating scrub it says it on clogs
pores with charcoal and clears the
complexion it's for oily skin it is it's
oil three and a half salicylic acid an
end 2% it was really really nice again I
opened it up so that I could get
everything out and it smelt really good
kind of like a man's cologne or
something I don't know some people like
you're like sound like it smells good
but it really smelled good it really
really kind of just like was really
scrubby and very nice so I would
definitely get a full-size of that
Garnier clean plus blackhead and
eliminating screw next I've used up this
skin and company or skin &amp;amp; Co truffle
therapy serum and again opened it up
stuff to get everything out it was okay
it wasn't amazing it did feel quite
moisturizing but I think a full size of
this is like $120 so probably won't be
purchasing that next I used up another
serum this is the Olay Henriksen truth
serum collagen booster with vitamin C
complex I thought I was gonna like this
a lot more than I did I thought the
texture was a little slimy and it just
wasn't as moisturizing as I thought it
would be and I know that you know
vitamin C isn't necessarily moisture I
think it's more for brightening purposes
but um I just don't like it as much as I
thought I would it wasn't like a
completely offensive but it was just one
of those things that I don't know if I
would repurchase I'm undecided about it
um it did have a nice orange e scent to
it kind of smelled like the summer's eve
wash actually so I did like this
and let's see here I used up a perfume
yeah cuz I'm so many I'm so happy I used
one up think I might keep this bottle
because it's so pretty but this is the
vintage bloom by Jessica Simpson this is
a beautiful fragrance I am NOT going to
repurchase right away because I have so
many perfumes I need to go through but
how cute is that bottle I think I'm
gonna keep it for like decor or
something well place that over here so I
remember I used up the bubble and bubble
hairdresser is invisible oil conditioner
again cut it open so I could get
everything out really really likes this
umm well I don't know there was a part
of me that really really liked it and
then another part of me that didn't it
didn't seem to help up like tangles in
the shower or anything and I'm one of
those people that like if the hair you
know if the wind blows a certain way my
hair will actually get tangled so I
really need something that I can put
through my hair that will help detangle
in the shower then I can comb through
this felt really light and just didn't
really help with the tangles however it
did mooster eyes really well so I'm
undecided about this I got this little
set along with some of the invisible oil
and also be invisible shampoo in a
500-point perk from Sephora but I'm not
quite sure if I would repurchase the
conditioner I'm still going through the
shampoo right now might repurchase that
well I didn't purchase these technically
but you know what I mean beauty points
but I would possibly get the full size
of the shampoo I'm decided about the
conditioner but it was nice it says that
it has six feather light oils to help
soften silk silken and tame deep frizz
detangle and protect not quite sure
about the detangling but definitely did
soften and you know D frizz my hair
nicely and I liked that it was light you
know even though it's filled with oils
it was still light so anyway I used up
another makeup product so proud this is
the Revlon brow fantasy and dark blonde
as you can see that little pencil is on
its last less of lap of life um and then
this other side I don't use this other
side too often but it's a gel that you
can just let go through your brows with
but this is one of my favorite brow
pencils ever and I really do like route
paths
so revlon brow fantasy highly highly
recommend used up some more samples the
josie maran argan milk intensive
hydrating treatment this was really nice
however i do prefer just the argan oil i
don't need like the milk consistency
however if you are someone who doesn't
want that heavy oil feeling on your skin
then i highly recommend picking up at
the milk because this is like a little
bit of a lighter consistency but i'm
fine with just the regular oil I also
used up the Paula's Choice resist daily
pore refining treatment with 2% BHA from
north normal oily and combination skin
in a sole silk accident in and among
clubs and refines pores reduces signs of
aging and smooth skin texture this was
just okay it wasn't the best thing I've
ever used on my skin but it felt pretty
good and I felt like it really did I'll
clog my pores so I'm sorry
maybe I need to try a few more samples
used up some perfume samples and also a
Schick intuition cure nourishing razor
head if you guys have not seen my
favorite tools video or my like favorite
dumb favorite tools video that's kind of
weird
my favorite products like tools that I
use for my face and things like that I
think I posted it maybe about a week ago
I talked about this particular razor
they shake intuition it's amazing and
they come with these little disposable
razor heads and this was one of them
that's really good too and then the last
couple things I used up
oh I thought these were perfume they're
not these are the hairdresser's
invisible oil these are the bumble and
bumble these were really nice I would
definitely consider purchasing a big
size of that oil because it was really
nice really helped my hair just stopping
up and just kind of seal in and eat like
dry areas and it just made it look good
without weighing it down and the last
thing I knew stuff was the Versace a
bright crystal absolute oh dude bath you
spray looks like that really really
pretty and I'll see how it smells pretty
sure I like this one so anyway those
were my empties for the month of May
I hope you guys enjoyed this video if
you did give it a thumbs up and I'll see
you my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
