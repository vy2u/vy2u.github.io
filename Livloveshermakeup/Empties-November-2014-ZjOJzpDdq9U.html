I have my empties for the month of
November
um I can't believe them up has gone by
so quickly but I thought I better get
these oh I thought I better get these up
before the month is over which is
tomorrow so uh let me just filter them
the first thing I used up was at the
studio 35 Beauty cleansing towelettes
wet facial wipes deep cleans and gently
removes makeup compared to ponds
original all-day clean wet cleansing
towelettes and I got this idea from
another youtuber here named L her name
is L is for living that is her YouTube
name she says why pay extra money on
things that you don't have to and for me
makeup cleansing wipes I use and then I
wipe off you know I clean off with my
cleanser so what is the point of
purchasing the $7 ones when I can get
the compareto brand for a lot cheaper so
I really really liked these ones they
were a little more textured and I have
recently picked up the Neutrogena what
is it the knockoff brand the Neutrogena
what is it the hydrating wipes and I
love those those are so much softer than
these but I would definitely consider
using it yes so definitely liked those
the next thing I used up was a sample of
the professional I have this full size
but this was the perfect amount for the
travels that I was drisana I was
traveling so this was actually a really
nice one day just to use that small
amount and pat it on my nose my chin and
my forehead so really nice sample the
next one I used up was the John Frieda
sheer blond highlight activating
enhancing shampoo that brightens the
full spectrum of blonde tones for darker
blondes I am a natural darker blonde I
do not highlight or color my hair at all
and I thought that this would be nice
during the cooler months where my hair
starts to turn into kind of a mousy
color I thought this would be nice to
bring my highlights back and it really
really did and it smelled delicious so
I'm very very happy with this one loved
it definitely would reverse
the next thing I used up was the L'Oreal
advanced hair care total repair 5 damage
erasing balm with ceramides and this is
just a deep conditioner I'm currently
using the one at the same exact one but
it's called the extreme version that
comes out of the squeezy tube and I must
prefer that one it's thicker but also it
is not in the tub and I just feel like
this is not a sanitary and it's not as
easy you know it's really easy to just
use those squeezy tubs when you're in
the shower so I prefer that one I
probably won't repurchase the tub one so
the next sample I used up was the
bullsháá detoxifying black cleanser I
loved this I would totally totally buy
this in a full-size I recently just
picked up a new cleanser so that
probably won't be for a long time but I
really liked this and I definitely would
repurchase or not repurchase but
purchased in a full-size so the next two
things I used to have before the Urban
Decay all nighter makeup setting sprays
I used up two of these I love these so
much I am hoping that what is it Loreena
just came out with I believe a makeup
setting spray I am hoping that it is
just as good as these because I'm going
to pick that up next and if it's not as
good I have to go back to this you know
this is my favorite one but hopefully
the L'Oreal one will be just as good and
it is cheaper so we'll see about that
but if not definitely will repurchase
these low the next thing I used up with
a sample of the what is this um maybe
okay of her friends are flaky but Ali's
like should never be so this is from
soap &amp;amp; Glory keep packaging this was
their smoothie star
lightly whipped body butter cream and I
loved this you guys this was amazing I
used it on my legs and it was just so
nourishing and made them so soft and it
smelled amazing so I would definitely
consider picking up the full size of
that the next thing I used up was the
Estee Lauder perfectionist CPR wrinkle
lifting / firming serum I really like
the serums from Estee Lauder I
apparently moved on to another
and I got the advanced night repair one
which is very very popular but I really
really loved this one too so I would
definitely come back to this in the
future the next thing I used to have
would let's see here another sample this
is from origins this is their high
potency night 2 mins and I loved this
this was really really wonderful over my
retinol at night I really really liked
this it really made my skin glow and my
skin just looked amazing in the morning
so I would definitely consider picking
this up um the next thing I used up was
the clean and clear deep action
exfoliating scrub oil-free gently
exfoliates to clean deep down to the
pores this took me forever to go through
I only use scrubs in the morning but I
have recently moved on to another one I
was very excited when I finally had the
chance to I picked up the st. Ives one
there's this new mandarin lemon one
that's really really nice and it's not
too abrasive it's not like the apricot
one it's very very nice and kind of
creamy so I loved it but I also did
really really love this I would
definitely come back to this in the
future but I like to try new things um
the last few things are all samples
let's see here I used up a sample of the
Urban Decay Eden eyeshadow primer potion
it came in this little pod it came with
like I think four of these and this
lasted a good while and honestly I had
never tried the Eden
you know the the color the Eden and I
love this one it really really covered
up any veins I had on my eyes in any
darkness so I would definitely consider
purchasing this full size the next thing
I used up was the fresh rose hydrating
eye gel cream and I loved this this was
amazing I think I'm definitely going to
pick this up I'm currently going through
a Shiseido and a Mario Badescu eye cream
which is going to last me a very long
time but I am definitely I'm going to
look this up after and try it out the
next thing I used up was this little UB
moisturizing skin cream I loved this it
was extremely moisturizing it felt great
I used it on my body I don't know if
you're supposed to use it on your face
but it was very very thick and very
moist
rising I would definitely consider
purchasing the full-size the next thing
I used up was a perfume sample this is
Versace right crystal I loved this the
smelled beautiful definitely would
consider picking up the full size of
that um another perfume that I did not
really like and I probably won't
purchase is the Indigo it's the nest
fine fragrances I mean I just I would
not repurchase this actually you don't
even know if this is the Cologne it kind
of smelled like a cologne but kind of
smells like a perfume let me know down
below if this is actually a cologne but
it is not for me I will not pick up a
full-size of that um just a few more
left here I used up one of the Smashbox
Smashbox photo finish foundation primers
I actually hated it this time that I
used it I used to have you know like
tubs of these I used to have a few of
these and I did not like it not happy so
no not going to a purpose on the other
hand the HD high definition primer is
wonderful it's more like a gel
moisturizer but it really is a beautiful
formula and I would consider picking
this up in full-size the next thing I
used up was the precious cream from luck
town and I loved this this was amazing
it smelled beautiful amazing and it just
left my face feeling so so soft so I
would definitely consider picking this
up in full-size and the last thing I
used off I hated oh my god I hated this
so much this was the fresh Lotus youth
preserve radiance lotion with super 7
complex it protects and illuminates this
stuff made me break out overnight
overnight
like literally I actually ended up using
this during the day because I thought
you know it emits the skin I should use
it during the day oh my goodness you
guys
I had breakouts by the time I woke up
the next morning I had break this is one
of them yeah the big like chin says
right there yeah that's from this so
definitely would not get this it also
really really smelled horrible and that
is
my things so I will not pick this up
which is too bad because I do love the
Rose um what was it that I creamed that
came with this so it's too bad it's
interesting seeing different brands and
see what you like
so those are my empties for the month of
November I hope you guys enjoyed this
and I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
