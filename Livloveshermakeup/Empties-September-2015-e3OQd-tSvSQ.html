you so much for joining me let me get
comfy on my chair I hope you guys are
having a fantastic day today it is the
last day of September which means it is
time for me to film my empties for the
month so I have a lot of stuff in here I
think that we went through like a lot of
hand soap I remember because this was
the months that we moved to our new
apartment and I just remember washing my
hands like constantly for some reason I
don't know if it's just because the
boxes were all like dirty or something
but I think we have a lot of hands
hoping here lots of candles so yeah I'm
just gonna go through them if you guys
hear me throwing products into paper
bags I have two down here right next to
me one is gonna be for recycling no one
is gonna be for trash and I will be
taking those out immediately after
filming this video because I hate
storing emptiest but I actually love
filming empties so I really love filming
um these kind of videos but I just don't
like storing them because it's like I
feel like I just have a bag of trash
singing around so anyway let's just get
started the first thing I used up was
the urn
Irwin Naturals power to sleep PM these
are basically tablets that you can take
at nighttime I take two of them you take
them 30 minutes before going to sleep
and they help you sleep I am one of
those people that just has a hard time
sleeping I get insomnia and it's just I
don't know it's hard for me so basically
it says take two liquid gels thirty
minutes before bedtime it has calcium
magnesium flaxseed oil valerian extract
hops extract passion flower extract
lemon balm GABA melatonin alpha I mean
it just has really really good stuff in
it and I honestly do feel drowsy thirty
minutes after taking these so I highly
highly recommend if you have insomnia
these are really really awesome alright
next I use that let me pull this out
this is the tree hut Shea Moisture I
think epsom salts in tropical mango
it says it soothes a
and pains and it is with certified
organic shea butter and natural mango
extract they look like this these were
really really lovely they smelled so
good oh my gosh it's like the best mango
smell ever they smell amazing and they
really really do soothe your body you
just kind of pour maybe like a cup or
two into warm bath water and you sit
there and you just kind of soak it up
for like 20 minutes and your body will
feel better I especially like these when
I have my period because they really
really help like cramping and things
like that it really just soothes any
kind of aches and pains you might have
really really recommend those the next
thing my boyfriend and I went through
where the Tide Pods free and gentle this
is the I was always want to say
dishwasher stuff it's not for
dishwashers this is laundry detergent
these are just those little pods we get
these they have like 57 packs and then
you can get these at Target like in bulk
and these are the free and gentle they
are free of dyes and perfumes my
boyfriend is sensitive to scents and he
does have allergies and things like that
I don't so when I wash his clothes I
just popped one of these in and I just
clean everything but then when I do my
laundry I also pop in extra scent
boosters because I am NOT sensitive to
scent and I do love my laundry that's
not really good so we really like those
though because also for me they don't
interfere with any sense that the scent
boosters are going to give so um and it
also flies it's weird if you have like a
laundry detergent that smells really
good but then you combine it with like a
in wash scent booster that also smells
really good sometimes the scent doesn't
come out very well if that makes sense
so you get exactly what you know your
scent is and the scent boosters if you
mix it with a laundry detergent that is
free of dyes and perfumes so yeah I
really love those we have already ever
purchased next time we went through the
Bath and Body Works I was gonna say I
but no we because I know he helped me
with this this was in the kitchen this
is the bath and Bodyworks
sunlight and apple trees deep cleansing
hand soap this smelled really really
really good we like the deep cleansing
hand soap formula a lot and this is a
fresh apple
quits Kintz qu imce and Birchwood it
smell really really good it's just so
fresh smelling and it was just I don't
know it was great so yeah very very
fresh smelling would definitely
recommend I went through the fibre
advance gummies this is the most
delicious way to take your fiber these
are really good they do taste good I
don't know
it's fiber I don't know what to say I
don't like to get like the little
packets where you like pour it in
because I don't know sometimes they get
kind of like lumpy and they make your
water or orange juice or whatever you
put it in tastes kind of weird so I
prefer these because they are very yummy
and it's a good way to get your fiber I
think you get five grams of fiber with
two gummies per day so definitely
recommend those I did not repurchase
those I actually picked up a different
kind of fiber gummy it's from a brand
called
oli which is like a new brand that I've
recently seen at let's see here target
yes so yeah I have repurchased those
ones those ones are like apple flavored
those are thick too so gummy fiber
supplements very good the next thing I
went through was the john frieda sheer
blonde color correct anti brassy
cleansing treatment - this is a shampoo
that helps to neutralize yellow tones in
blonde hair it does not do anything this
was totally crappy I still used it up
because it does did clean my hair well
but it does not neutralize yellow orange
tones for a bright blonde color I'm
sorry but it just didn't I didn't think
it did that at all so I would not
repurchase um my favorite if you guys
are wondering my favorite purple shampoo
and the best I have found ever is the
germ act distinctions silver plus
shampoo that is the best one so don't
waste your money on that craft I went
through these yes - grapefruit - correct
and repair rejuvenating facial wipes
these are amazing these are so good at
removing makeup they're really really
soft and nice
I love these a lot you guys will see the
little sister product over here they are
I was thought they were way down at the
bottom but this is like the sister
product this is the yet - cucumber wipes
these are not the same these are amazing
ever moving makeup these kind of warrant
so I use these for swatches and just
while I was doing
make up to like white my hands but they
get to cucumber they just are not as wet
and also the untell leg it's like a lot
more dry where these ones are really
pillowy and soft and very very wet so
great clear movie makeup get the
grapefruit ones not the cucumber ones I
have not tried the blueberry ones I need
to try those ones next I used up the
cons exfoliating renewal wet cleansing
towelettes with citrus and cucumber
these are really nice these are very
good I don't use these to remove my
makeup but they are nice for exfoliating
so in if you want to use it in the
morning just to clean up your face
really quickly if you don't have time to
wash your face at the sink they're just
a very like multi-purpose you can use
them to remove makeup but they are a
little abrasive but I like those a lot I
would definitely repurchase oh my gosh
I'm just gonna go through all the
cleansing wipes because they're all here
at the top I'm a simple sensitive
skincare cleansing facial wipes these
are really great if you have sensitive
skin they have like no scent to them
they're just very very nice you can rub
them all over your eye area without any
irritation and it's a smile it simple
and it really it's okay
highly recommend and another makeup
removing pack that I recommend is the
Neutrogena makeup remover cleansing
towelettes these are not very good for
around the eye area if you are sensitive
they can stain a little bit but these
are nice for the you know like face area
I like these a lot they are very very
soft soft too alright next we used up
the Glade spray in frosted cookie party
we've had this since like last year it
took me forever to go through this
because you guys know I lived in
Manhattan last year so I left it at my
boyfriend's apartment and now of course
we live together so I finally gone
through it but um I was sitting around
in his bathroom in his apartment and I
was like you ever use it so I like to
have these in the bathroom for obvious
reasons they're just those nice little
sprays that you spray oh god there's
like nothing left in here it just like
bubbled out and spilled all over me
gross oh but it's so good you guys and
it's so cute look at little frosted
cookie party like I want to have a
frosted cookie party that is so cute
but anyway these are really nice I like
to have them in the bathroom we
faul scented one in our bathrooms now
but that's more of a winter kind of
spell or scent we used up about the body
work sweet cinnamon pumpkin deep
cleansing can so this is like a cult
favorite for the fall time it's really
really nice it literally just is like
pumpkin cinnamon and spice sugar it just
smells really really good very nice and
fresh very um kind of spicy smelling if
you like kind of spicy scents you like
that one alright so we used up the bath
and Bodyworks aromatherapy Energy orange
ginger hand soap we really really like
this one this is really nice this is not
a deep cleansing formula it's just a
normal soap but it smells so good it's
so uplifting like the scent is so good
especially in the morning it like really
wakes you up
it says boost your energy orange and
ginger essential oils are uplifting to
release tension and sharpen defenses so
we really really love that I get those
ones when they are on sale because
normally they're like seven dollars
Beast not even kidding four theorem a
therapy one so get them when they're
half up this is the bath and body where
it's like cherry Merlot deep cleansing
hand soap this is one of my favorite um
winter or fall oh my god but it smells
so good if you have never smelled the
scent it is amazing it is literally just
an addictive blend of dark cherry black
raspberry and scrumptious Merlot and it
smells so good this is the best on hand
soap for like the winter time I know
it's not right now but we already use it
up okay it's gone I'll have to get more
for the winter um another D club's again
so close you guys we used a lot of soap
this is the marshmallow pumpkin latte
this smells really really good too I
just know I love them oh this one's so
good - so this is a blend of creamy
pumpkin toasted marshmallows and praline
and it smells amazing highly recommend
that one
all right another hands up now okay I
think we're done with the hands ups but
this is the bubble bath from about the
Body Works Signature Collection this is
Twilight woods a really intoxicating
scent for fall seriously makes really
really nice soft bubbles but really
really like a hypnotic blend I think
that's actually how they describe it on
the back it says Twilight woods a
hypnotic blend of apricot nectar mimosa
petals and Tuscan Cypress inspired by
the enticing warmth of woods at Twilight
and southern Idaho but seriously it
smells really maddening to notice you
should definitely check it out alright
let's do some of these candles right
here we went through the autumn
three-week candle from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
this is an amazing scent it's very very
fresh smelling very very similar to I
think we have sweater weather at the
bottom here but sweater weather is very
similar but this one's a lot more fresh
smelling and a little more sweet twist
weather sweater weather is a little more
like woodsy so this is really nice it
says it is a blend of bright red apples
cedar wood and notes of fir balsam so
really really liked that would
repurchase oh this was really good this
is actually a Chesapeake Bay candle and
you can get this brand at Target this is
the home scents in apple wood oh my god
this scent is amazing it smells so good
it is like the woodsy kind of scent you
know like logs like wood logs burning
but with Apple and it's amazing I'm
definitely gonna have to pick another
one of these up so you got that is all
supposed to be with candle but cheaper
and um you know just the prices so much
better it's target sorry but it's true I
love Bath &amp;amp; Body Works but it's true so
this is the sweater weather one this was
the one I compared to autumn it's just a
little more woodsy smelling but they do
smell quite similar so just a heads up
alright oh my gosh okay hopefully
nothing breaks there you I have like
sticky stuff something else now yeah
all right I went through the nature's
bounty optimal solutions extra strength
hair skin and nails argan oil infused
what are these multivitamin supplements
so it looks like that these are nice I
did repurchase these I like these for my
hair and my nails I don't notice like a
huge huge difference honestly my hair
just needs to be cut it's just getting a
little rough right now like I've been
having kind of a rough time with my hair
but oh my gosh I just dropped a few
things hold on
yeah my hair has just been a little
rough lately I did go online and pick up
another supplement from I think it's
called phyto and that is like a hair and
nails supplement as well and that is
from Sephora I'll be hauling that soon
but anyway um these are nice I do like
these I think that I do notice a little
slight bit of a difference and that's
enough for me these ones you take three
of these a day they're really cute
they're like tiny little pink pearls I
did pick these up in the gummy formula
so I did repurchase them but honestly
the companies don't taste very good and
I don't think they have the same stuff
in them because this one has like argan
oil it has all the vitamins whereas that
one only has like biotin in it and I am
a little it's tricky with me for biotin
because I tend to break out with a lot
of biotin side to be careful with those
ones so I am using them now they're okay
but I'll probably go back to using the
actual little supplements instead of
becoming still alright I used up the
only at Target so this is one scent
that's only at Target it's the summer's
eve aloe love cleansing wash from yeah
this is the pH balance dermatologist and
kind of collagen tested this is they
washed for down they're good to clean up
down there ladies but just really really
nice it is pH balanced so it's not going
to irritate you down there I do like
that scent but I recently picked up what
is it like the island whose tropic one
or that kind of scent it which smells
like candy it's my favorite self I like
that one more but this was a nice scent
um I went through a lonely house
Rapunzel honor oh wait is everyone fine
so um this is the Huggies baby wipes I
just like to use these to get off
swatches when I'm doing my makeup I like
to wipe my hand long them things like
that I would like to have one right now
if I could wipe my hands all right oh my
god another deep cutting hand soap all
right this is the pumpkin pecan waffles
oh my god this is one of my favorite
fall scents you guys have to smell this
it smells amazing it is fluffy waffles
sugar pecans and maple syrup just need
to take a whiff of it it's so good you
guys you have to set you have to smell
this um definitely go just just get it
if you like like warmth a good sense you
will love that all right moving on the
BH Cosmetics BH Studio Pro makeup brush
cleaner this was nice it came out like
in a spray form it is one of those that
dries instantly so you can use your
makeup brushes right away so I do I did
like that I would repurchase although I
think I'm going to get what is that one
that's really popular in like the big
blue tub I don't know what it's called
you guys but I think it's on Sephora
calm cold everybody uses it but I want
to try that one out next alright I used
up the Urban Decay chill makeup setting
spray this is cooling and hydrating I
like this one a lot it's probably my
favorite one of all the Urban Decay
setting sprays I used up the sample of
the living proof nourishing styling
cream cut it open so that I could get
all the product out this was really
really nice I actually really like this
my hair was very very nice and smooth
when I use this so definitely recommend
that one used up a sample of the pure
ology smooth perfection cleansing
conditioner this was just okay it's
supposed to be one of those things
please excuse my nails like I said my
hair my nails are having a rough time
lately um but it's supposed to be like
one of those shampoo and conditioner
things so it's like a conditioner that
supposed to cleanse your hair but
honestly I have flat oily hair and it's
just very fine and it did not
clean my scalp properly these are the
Peter Thomas Roth clinical on wrinkle
peel pads I love these I would
definitely repurchase these these are
amazing if you have basically any kind
of skin except for sensitive these will
be too much for you but basically what
you do is you take a pad you rub it all
over your face leave it on for about one
to three minutes and you wash it off and
you neutralize it with water and it's
amazing it's just so good you guys
it has alpha beta and gamma acids in it
exfoliators amino acids it's you know
clarifies firms resurfaces exfoliates it
does it all it's really really amazing
finally recommend very good for clearing
up acne if you have a ready complexion
big pores anything you should purchase
those all right so the Tresemme Fresh
Start new formula no visible residue
volumizing dry shampoo I actually like
this a lot this was good it had a very
nice scent to it so would repurchase the
Bumble and Bumble sample this is the
surf creme rinse conditioner this is
okay I like this for when I braid my
hair and I want a little more texture so
that like the braids really sticks so I
did like it for that I used up you it
was something broke open oh it smells
like black cherry below kind of happy it
was that one actually smells really good
but this is um the Clinique liquid
facial soap cleanser this was just a
sample I don't recommend getting that I
recommend going ahead and picking up the
Cetaphil cleanser if you do want a dupe
for it because that's the same exact
thing this is the blender cleanser solid
by beauty blender I probably would not
repurchase another one of these yes it
is very easy but I have found something
else that cleans my beauty blenders and
sponges just as well this is disgusting
this is covered in black cherry Merlot
but I don't care because it smells so
good
this is the kaplan md cellular
rejuvenating concentrate this is an
amazing amazing amazing amazing little
um
serum highly recommend I think it's like
$700 for okay that was an exaggeration
it's like $160 for a full-size but I
would actually consider getting it
because it's so good I noticed that my
face and my skin just looks amazing when
I use it
and the texture is really nice and
smooth and moisturize us it's great
another great product is the pixie skin
treats glow tonic exfoliating toner with
5% glycolic aloe vera and ginseng I have
to find this I need to find it at a
target I maybe I need to just order it
online my target never has it but I am
definitely going to back up awesome I
used up the clinic clinic smart custom
Repair Serum this was nice it kind of
smelled like processed deli meat gross
but seriously it kind of smelled weird
but it was nice I didn't notice like a
difference as I did with the kaplan md
serum which says a lot because the
kaplan md serum lasted me like four days
because it's so small and that one
lasted me forever the Clinique one but I
didn't notice that it's big of a
difference so I'd rather pick up the
kaplan md one I went through the Olay
Henriksen African red tea foaming
cleanser this is a revitalizing
antioxidant facial cleanser smells like
oranges really really nice I like this a
lot it's foaming um it doesn't remove
like makeup or anything like that so you
definitely want to remove your makeup
first but a very very good cleanser I
rate some samples bright now vitamin c
BB serum hated this smell horrible
it was disgusting I would not use it all
right Paula's Choice was this ultra
light super antioxidant concentrate
serum didn't really notice the
difference again I only had a one day
sample so that's probably why but I've
heard good things I did like the texture
of it
the ormer of itzá Almoravids yeah
budapest this is a cleansing balm I
really like it I would purchase a
full-size of that um Smashbox photo
finish primer water love this I have a
full-size I'm almost out of it I will
repurchase the clevis use from a la cita
love this it's an amazing amazing
amazing amazing moisturizer if you have
very very dry skin or just want to feel
like you were putting precious things on
your face
precious green love it I really should
get to April size of that the do your
dream skim dream skin no capture total
dream skin this was just okay it was
like a very nice smelling gel it was
like blue or purple or something like
that it was pretty but it didn't really
do that much for my skin and the fresh
black th delayed cream I noticed a
difference the morning after I use this
but it was very very greasy and I just
don't know if I want that much grease on
my face at night alright guys that was
it I feel like this went on for a while
I was starting to get a little a little
ADHD ish there by the end which I can
say because I do actually have ADHD but
anyway I was getting a little distracted
but I hope you guys enjoyed this month's
empties stay tuned for next month's um
we'll see I probably won't go through as
much like soap I have no idea why we
used too much soap this month but yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
did please give it a thumbs up I'll see
you my next fun bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
