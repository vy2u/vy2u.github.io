to walk you guys through my night time
skincare routine or just my nighttime
routine in general here in the bathroom
so I already removed my makeup but I
usually just remove my makeup and I go
ahead and use the Neutrogena eye makeup
remover lotion and I use that and then I
rub two cotton balls over my eyes and
then I go in with my facial wipes for my
face makeup so after I do that I like to
just push my hair back get it out of my
face and with this add yellow mist after
I remove my makeup just to kind of give
some moisture back to the skin so let's
spray this I just kind of let it sit
down a little bit and then I will have
it in no I just Pat it in I like it it
just gives that extra layer of moisture
wow this shirt looks so baggy really
bumming out tonight okay next I go in
with my Estee Lauder
advanced Night Repair Serum and I apply
this on my neck and all over my face
you always want to take things down your
neck because that is actually the first
area that you really really age and it's
very visible when you age so I take this
under my eyes - and when my eye lips I
usually use three pumps of this in the
morning
and it not
serums are really what sink into the
skin and repair so it's important to use
this theorem as well as a moisturizer
moisturizers are obviously from moisture
and then the serums are mostly for
repairing then you kind of just want to
Pat it into your skin this is actually
the best way to absorb the product fully
and pay especially close especially a
close special close attention to the
areas where you're prone to wrinkles so
for me right here under my eyes and
right here okay after that if I am
really really breaking out which I am i
go ahead and i use a acne treatment
tonight they're gonna use one of these
Neutrogena acne stress control pads i
like these they have salsa lick acid in
them and they're just super super easy
to use so i just gonna put that on where
i am breaking out just kind of sink into
my skin again normally usually between
products want to give at least three to
five minutes for all of them to sink in
but i just wanted to show you guys this
pretty quickly so after that i believe
with my retinol the current retinol that
I'm using is Neutrogena agents
intensives
line so this is the serum and this is
the moisturizer they work very very well
so I take two pumps of this this is the
Sierra
why the hungry neck I highly recommend
using retinol for any age group really
if you're over the age of 18 and you
start using retinol it really will help
with prevention sun spots wrinkles
things like that take another 2 cups of
that serum and under my eyes and I did a
little too much so I'll take the rest on
my forehead again pain especially dose
attention is not what it is especially
close attention in the areas where
wrinkles show up so I always put
products on my eyelids people always ask
a lot of my friends ask why um a few age
the skin there starts to Sag so you want
to keep that out there you know and ah
it starts to Sag from moisture loss and
also just aging so retinol is really
good for that and then also if your
moisturization so after I apply that
serum you let it kind of sink in a
little bit and then I'm going to go in
with the Neutrogena ageless intensive
deep wrinkle moisture this is the
moisturizer it's a night formula it's
really really light it's not heavy which
I like um you want to be careful with
retinol around the eyes you want to work
your way up well just in general work
your way off with retinol when you first
start using in because you will start
peeling and get a little skin irritation
that's why I also recommend starting out
with a drugstore one instead of a higher
percentage oh you know prescription
my cheeks oh no no sorry he hears
something the cat is playing with the
shower curtain so now I look really
greasy but my skin look it just will
sink this in by morning I really like
this combination again I switch up my
skincare pretty regularly not really
retinol and things like that but like
acne treatments I have a ton of
different ones and you know I like to
trying to think so then you want to go
in and Pat again and then I'm going to
go in with my eye cream yes this is a
very long very long nighttime skin
routine but it works so the eye cream
I'm using today I switch off between the
Shiseido
and the Mario Badescu pneumonectomy eye
cream I'm gonna use this one tonight it
does make my eyes appear like like the
skin around it a little blue which is
not attractive but you just want to take
this rub it and then Pat you don't want
to be swiping and just causing warming
goals and then I take the excess and hit
the eyelid all the way up to the brow
you really should use your ring finger
when you're putting an eye cream but I
have more control with my middle finger
so I use that one have any excess I just
go ahead and hit right here or sometimes
people get wrinkles because if you get
wrinkles from West moisture so the more
moisture you can add in there the more
will plump back up so that is my current
nighttime skin routine I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I'm going to go and
probably get my PJs on now and I'll see
you man in fun right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
