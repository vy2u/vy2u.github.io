to walk you guys through my nighttime
skincare routine or just my nighttime
routine in general here in the bathroom
so I already removed my makeup but I
usually just remove my makeup and I go
ahead and use the Neutrogena eye makeup
remover lotion and I use that and then I
rub two cotton balls over my eyes and
then I go in with my facial wipes for my
face maker so after I do that I like to
just push my hair back get it out of my
face and we go in with this Eddie Ernest
after I remove my makeup just to kind of
give some moisture back to the skin so
let's pray this I just kind of let it
sit there a little bit and then I will
have it in in a few bags and I just Pat
it in I like it it just gives that extra
layer of moisture wow this sure looks so
baggy really bumming out tonight ok next
I go in with my estee lauder advanced
night repair serum and I apply this on
my neck and all over my face
you always want to take things down your
neck because that is actually the first
area that you really really aged and
it's very visible when you age so I take
this under my eyes too and when why I
lips I usually use three pumps of this
in the morning and it up
serums are really what sink into the
skin and a pair so it's important to use
this theorem as well as a moisturizer
moisturizers are obviously from moisture
and then the serums are mostly for
repairing eyelids then you kind of just
want to Pat it into your skin this is
actually the best way to absorb the
product fully it's me and pay especially
a close especially a close special close
attention to the areas where you're
prone to wrinkles so for me right here
under my eyes and right here okay after
that um if I am really really breaking
out which I am I go ahead and i use a
acne treatment tonight are going to use
one of these neutrogena acne stress
control paths I like these they have
salsa like acid in them and they're just
super super easy to use so I just going
to put that on where I am breaking out
hangs phone for normal acne so you're
just going to let that kind of sink into
my skin again normally usually between
products want to give at least three to
five minutes for all of them to sink in
but i just wanted to show you guys this
pretty quickly so after that I believe
with my retinol um the current retinol
that I'm using is neutrogena ages
intensives line so this is the serum and
this is the moisturizer they work very
very well so I take two pumps of this
this is the Sierra
why the Nandi neck I highly recommend
using retinol for any age group really
if you're over the age of 18 and you
start using retinol it really will help
with prevention about sun spots wrinkles
things like that take another two cups
of that serum here and under my life and
I did a little too much so I'll take the
rest on my forehead again pain a special
close attention special clothes that is
not what it is especially close
attention not packed my the areas where
wrinkles show up so under eyes I always
put products on my eyelids people always
ask a lot of my friends ask why um if
you age the skin there starts to sag so
you want to keep that up there you know
it starts to sag from moisture loss and
also um just aging so retinol is really
good for that and then also if your
moisturization so after I apply that
serum you let it kind of sink in a
little bit and then I'm going to go in
with the Neutrogena ageless intensive
deep wrinkle moisture this is the
moisturizer it's a night formula it's
really really light not heavy which I
like that's it so bad right just yeah so
I'm going to take a little bit of this
lie on my forehead and again on my
eyelids I'm you want to be careful with
retinol around the eyes you want to work
your way up well just in general work
your way up with retinol when you first
start using in because you will start
peeling and get a little skin irritation
that's why I also recommend starting out
with a drugstore one instead of a higher
percentage oh you know prescription
so my cheek so now my neck my eyes sorry
you hear something the cat is playing
with the shower curtain so now I look
really greasy but my skin nothing it
just will sink this in by morning um I
really like this combination again I
switch up my skincare pretty regularly
and not really retinol and things like
that but like acne treatments I have a
ton of different ones and um you know I
like they're trying to think so then you
want to go in and Pat again and then I'm
going to go ahead with my migraine yes
this is a very long very long night time
skin routine but it works so that I
cream I'm using today I switch off
between the shiseido and the Mario
Badescu pneumonectomy eye cream I'm
going to use this one tonight it does
make my eyes appear like like the skin
around it a little blue which is not
attractive but okay you just want to
take this rub it and then Pat you don't
want to be swiping and just causing warm
and goals and then I took the excess and
hit the eyelid all the way up to the
brow
um you really should use your ring
finger when you're putting an eye cream
but I have more control with my little
finger so is that one have any excess I
just go ahead and hit right here or
sometimes people get wrinkles and
because if you get wrinkles from West
moisture so the more moisture you can
add in there tomorrow will plump back up
so that is my current nighttime skin
routine I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I'm going to go and probably get
my PJs on now and I'll see you manage
fun bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
