hope you guys are having a really good
day today I'm going to be walking you
guys through my nighttime skincare
routine so I change up my skincare
routine a lot the morning when a lot and
also the nighttime one so recently I
just find that my skin gets used to
products that's why I like to change
them up so recently I did switch over to
a new nighttime skincare routine and
I've been using this for about maybe a
month now and I really really like it
I'm going to stick with it I'm very
happy with the results so far so yeah
actually I think this skincare routine
has taken a few products out of like the
listing that I had in the other one I
was putting a lot of stuff on and now um
I feel like I'm not putting as much on
so but it's still just as beneficial so
I'm really really happy um but other
than that I yeah I am NOT filming this
in my bathroom because I just can't do
the demo as like putting the stuff on
because the lighting is so bad in every
single bathroom that I try and film in
even if i bring my professional lighting
in the camera or the you know lighting
is just not good enough so i'm just
going to be talking you guys through it
today so anyway let's get started i'm
the first thing i like to do at night is
remove my makeup so i have a few
different varieties of things that i
like to use um i don't use any special
one on particular nights I just grab
whatever i'm in the mood for so one way
i like to remove my makeup is by using
um makeup remover wipes these ones are
the acquaint you t compared to
Neutrogena night combing cleansing
tallaght and you get 40 pre-moistened
towelettes in here for like under five
dollars these the equate brand is the
compared to from walmart so with a
really good deal right here like i said
you get 40 of these for like under five
dollars and normally like a pack of
Neutrogena ones will cost you you know
up to six or seven dollars so this is a
really great deal so i love makeup
removal wipes i really like these ones i
tried all different kinds of quite often
however i think that um you know as long
as they really remove the makeup very
well that's what I like I have found
that usually wipes don't remove my I
make
as well as my face makeup but they
always take care of the face makeup so
it's kind of one of those things also
these are really nice if you're in a
rush or if you just can't be bothered at
nighttime so anyway I'm another way that
I do also like to remove my makeup is by
using a micellar water um this
particular one is the Sephora triple
action cleansing water for face and eyes
it's makeup be gone and I have tried a
few micellar waters I really just gotten
into them probably in the past month or
so so I do like them I think it takes a
little longer to remove like a full face
of makeup um but it does do the job so
you know it just depends on what you're
in the mood for if you're in the mood
for sitting in front of the mirror and
removing your makeup slowly and kind of
just sitting there and enjoying it then
this is a nice way to do it it does
remove makeup well and I think that my
seller waters are really like
multi-purpose they can be used for a lot
of different things so that's another
way that I like to remove my makeup and
the third way that I enjoy removing my
makeup or the third way that works for
me is by using an oil I have not tried
like just putting olive oil or coconut
oil on my face but I have tried the
Garnier nourishing like oil cleanser or
something like that so basically what
you do is you put the oil on dry skin
and you work it in and it removes all
the makeup and then you just wash your
face you're not left with any oily
residue or anything and it cleanses and
it also just takes all the makeup off
it's probably my favorite way of
removing my makeup however it is a
little more time consuming than just you
know rubbing on makeup remover cloth or
micellar water on your skin so anyway
the one I'm showing you guys is
something that i showed in my hall
yesterday I have the box for about a
week before so um I have been using this
for about a week this is the bosha
makeup break up cool cleansing oil
really enjoy this it does a great job of
removing makeup I'm not quite sure about
the cooling benefit I don't really feel
that but it really feels soft and it's
easy to get the makeup off I don't feel
like I'm dragging it over my eyes or
anywhere on my skin it just feels really
really nice and probably my favorite way
of removing makeup but it's also
probably the most time consuming anyway
so moving on after I do that I wash my
face whether it be in the shower or at
the sink I always use my clarisonic I
only use my clarisonic at night that's
just what I found has worked best for my
skin I have the clarisonic mia and the
brush head i use is the lux brush from
clarisonic so i really like the
combination of this with this particular
cleanser this is the body shop tea tree
skin clearing facial wash it says it's
suitable for blemished skin intense
daily cleansing removes impurities for
clearer looking skin so I really really
like this product I am about halfway
through and I've already gone and
purchased another gel cleanser I just
kind of noticed while I've been using
this that I love gel cleansers I think
they foam up really well and they're
really really nice in the warmer months
so I really really like this um it's
kind of giving me a break or my skin a
break from benzoyl peroxide and
salicylic acid I do have combination
skin and I am prone to breakouts oh I do
have to use a cleanser at night that has
some kind of acne medication and tea
tree oil is really really really good
for acne and um the scent is very very
strong if you are someone who does not
let the scent of tea tree oil you are
going to hate this do not get it but if
you are someone who has blemish prone
skin or combination skin or even oily
skin you would probably really like this
and it really loud there's up nicely
weighted clarisonic all right after that
I get out of the shower and I dry my
face or you know if I'm just at the sink
I dry my face and I use my peter thomas
roth clinical skincare unwrinkle peel
pads this is a 20-percent complex of
alpha beta and gamma acids it says
exfoliators and amino acids the building
blocks of peptides exfoliates resurfaces
clarifies firms helps visibly minimize
pores fine lines of even skin tone Oh
vitamins a c d e and apt camomile green
tea extracts fragrance free alcohol free
soft pillow pads for all skin types
quite a mouthful um literally not a twix
dry mouth can't even talk um but these
are amazing so basically they're just
these little discs that you run over oh
I can't open it but they're just these
little cleansing pads that you run over
skin and you want to leave it on for
three minutes I usually take it down my
neck area as well so i usually use one
little pad all over my face just avoid
the lip and I
area and then I take one down my neck as
well you leave it on for three minutes
no longer than three minutes three
minutes is the recommended time if you
can actually handle the product like I
said there are alpha beta and gamma
acids in here so these are acids so it's
really going to be eating away and
exfoliating the skin and really cleaning
it so if you leave it on too long you
will get a severe burn so you must wash
it off if you have sensitive skin only
leave it on for like 30 seconds um but I
have worked my way up to three minutes
and after the three minutes is done I
wash it off and then again I just pat
dry my face and then I like to go in
with the other product that is basically
the last product um so this is the
polished choice clinical 1% retinol
treatment I've been using this for about
a month I have tried it before and I had
a really really bad at first reaction to
it I guess my skin just couldn't handle
the one percent retinol however I saw
this on the Polish toys website and now
they have a little duel thing that you
can buy it like a little duo and this is
for people who cannot tolerate the
retinol as much it basically comes with
the clinical one percent retinol
treatment and also the resist moisture
renewal oil booster for dry or very dry
skin so retinol tends to drive the skin
out so it kind of makes sense to add in
an oil or a moisturizer or even top you
know the retinol with a moisturizer
however you need to wait in between um
you know layering products on you need
to give them a few minutes to sink in
especially the retinol but I love this
because it's just so easy and i have not
had any any adverse reaction no redness
no peeling so it's been great so what I
do is I take one pump of this and one
drop of this from my forehead and then I
take two pumps of this and one drop of
and two drops of this for my cheeks my
nose that kind of area so basically i'm
using three pumps in total of the one
percent retinol and three drops of the
resist moisture renewal oil boosters and
it says they have ceramides in argan oil
in here and I just find that it
complements the retinol really well and
I'm still getting the great benefits of
the retinol so anyway that is like the
last thing that I use on my face if I'm
really having a dry skin night I will go
me doing my plane I will go ahead and
apply a moisturizer even on top of that
if I feel like it's going to be a little
sensitive I noticed that if I go on and
off retinol like if I do one day and
then I skip the next do another skip the
next I my skin has to get used to it
again and i start to get like little
pimples so I like to use it every single
night so for that reason if I am having
like a dry skin or sensitive skin night
i will put another moisturizer on top of
these two I make sure that I wait about
10 minutes in between and then I'll put
the moisturizer on top and I make sure
that it doesn't have any like acids or
anything in that no sunscreen just a
basic moisturizer yeah whatever so yeah
the next thing I do is my eye cream
lately i've been using the peter thomas
roth anti-aging cellular i repair gel
literally only been using this for
probably about a week however i'm not
picky with eye creams i could show you
guys a bunch i have a lot that i keep
out on my sink area so basically i have
like this is 801 a mario badescu one and
now this one the reason i like this and
i called this yesterday i'm the reason I
like it is because it's a gel and it
just feels really nice and cooling on
the eyes and it's really easy to you
know tap it it doesn't leave any
coloration no greasiness it's really
really great so right now i'm using that
um but i'm not picky like i said i will
use any eye cream that I you know have
available um so after that I just have
one more thing so yeah my skincare
routine has really kind of downsized a
lot but i'm still getting really good
benefits so i'm very happy but the last
thing i do is use a lip balm I just have
one here to show you guys I have so many
lip balms I still need to do a
collection video on them because there's
that many um but excuse me basically
I'll just use any you know lip balm that
I feel like using one that I've been
doing the past couple nights coupes that
I really really like is the Kerry bran
cinnamon tinted lip whip really really
love this you can get this at Sephora
it's just amazing it smells amazing it's
super super moisturizing it doesn't have
petroleum in it it's not just going to
poke the lips it's really good to help
moisturize them I would save this and my
bite beauty lip mask are probably in my
favorite overnight treatments if I have
like really dry lips but I
make sure that I noise far as my lips at
night so anyway that is my skincare
routine something I kind of forgot to
mention I always take things down my
neck whether it be by retinol or whether
it be a moisturizer or a toner or
something like in the morning I used
toners I always bring it down my neck I
just kind of consider that part of like
my face because you just want to take
everything down your neck it's good to
do so anyway I hope you guys enjoyed
this video if you did please give it a
thumbs up and I'll see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
