my channel happy Wednesday today's video
is going to be all about eyeshadow
palettes that practically blend
themselves this is like a dream for me
because honestly I don't like to spend a
lot of time blending my eyeshadows and I
know a lot of people are like why do you
collect so many palettes if you don't
even like to blend them well you want to
know why is because there are good
enough formulas on the market where you
don't have to spend twenty five minutes
blending out your eyeshadow I'm a very
very everyday friendly kind of makeup
girl so I don't do the winged eyeliner
because I don't know how to I don't do
fake eyelashes also because I don't know
how to and I just don't really give a
 up but for the most part if you are
someone who's very busy like me or if
you're a little on the lazy side you
don't want to have to spend a lot of
time on your eyeshadow these are great
options that I think you're going to be
really happy with them so let's go ahead
and jump right into it to see first
couple ones that I want to talk about
are a specific formula and that is the
lorac Pro formula there is nothing on
the market like the lorac Pro formula as
far as blendability is concerned I do
have the lorac mega pro 3 as well as the
mega pro 2 these are no longer available
so I won't open those up but you can get
the lorac Pro one two and three and this
is the three this is the one I do not
have the two which is crazy because that
one is filled with cool toned eyeshadows
and you would think I would want that so
it will probably be on my list and next
but if there is anyone that I would
recommend to you it is the lorac pro one
this is beautiful you have your math on
the top you have the shimmers on the
bottom everything is created equally in
these palettes which I absolutely adore
so the shimmers and the matte blend just
as easily they feel the same it's
absolutely incredible so this is what
this one looks like you have some jewel
tones you have some nice brow bone
shades some shimmery kind of gold shades
over here and then some smoky tones love
this palette and then if you are more of
a really really everyday neutral
friendly kind of color girl you would
love this one this is the lorac pro 3
the only thing that they did in here
that I thought it was a mistake was that
they did try and do a glitter infused
shade and I'm just like don't do that
please don't do that I hate when they do
this glitter infused every single
brand even Too Faced like all of them I
hate that but they tried doing that with
the shade right here called medallion it
did not work out very well they should
just stick to the mattes and also to the
shimmers I wish lorac would make more of
their Pro palettes because they are
incredible all right the next two I want
to talk about are from the drugstore the
first one is the covergirl true Naked
Roses palette now I think all of them
blend just as easily they have like a
greenish goldish version and then also I
think they have like a smoky version but
this is the one that I liked the most
this is the roses palette and I got rid
of my Urban Decay Naked palette I was
not a huge fan I think these blends so
much better
they were beautiful they have nice rosy
tones to them and again the shimmers are
just as smooth as the mattes in here so
if you are looking for a good eyeshadow
palette from the drugstore would
recommend that also a Physicians Formula
makes these little quads right here that
are impeccable these are the Physicians
Formula mass collection quads and it
this particular one is called Canyon
classics if you are working with a
palette that has a ton of bright bold
colors and you really really need to
pull something in that will help you
know give you a nice matte brow bone
shade as well as a nice out transition
shade and even a liner shade or outer V
shaded these are perfect they do also
have a warmer toned one I have both of
them I like these more than my Urban
Decay Naked basics palette so if you
really want something that's beautiful
and creamy and blendable and matte you
would absolutely adore these and then of
course I have to talk about my violet
FAFSA Pro eyeshadows I love these
palettes so much you guys they have the
same sort of packaging you can see as
the lorac Pro palette now I still do
think that the lorac Pro palette blend
out a little better but the reason for
that is because these guys do have more
like foiled consistencies to them so
this first one here is the direction
metals but this is one of those palettes
where I do feel like the actual foiled
finish does blend nicely into the crease
sometimes you can have a little bit of
issues like I feel like the Juvia splays
palettes are a little more difficult
with those really thick kind of foiled
shades it's harder to blend those into
the crease so for whatever reason these
go on to everywhere on the eye really
really nicely so you can put them on
your lower lash line you can smoke them
out putting the outer V in the crease on
the lid everywhere and they're
absolutely beautiful so I love this one
and I of course love of the Holy Grail
palette the Holy Grail reminds me so
much of the modern renaissance palette
if you are a huge fan of those really
beautiful berry tones and outs with just
more neutral kind of subtle shades you
would love this palette and then I do
also have the Laura Lee palette which is
probably my least favorite out of the
three and that's just because I do find
the shade selection to be a little odd I
feel like there's just so many warm
tones and a lot of these do blend into
each other and look the same but overall
really really nice and if you want all
three of these palettes in one I would
go ahead and pick up the new ride-or-die
palette alright the next one I want to
talk about is from Tarte cosmetics it is
the tartlet in bloom palette now
do not have the original one I know that
they have like a tartlet palette but
this one is incredible these blend
beautifully on the eyes I feel like I do
not talk about this often enough but it
really is a good palette from Tarte so
this is their Amazonian clay um yeah
Amazonian clay formula that was made in
the u.s. it's just so so so good you
guys and I know that Tarte has been so
hit or miss lately but this is one of
the palettes that I would recommend
picking up especially if you just want a
neutral everyday friendly kind of
palette so this is what it looks like on
the inside you do have some luster
shades or shimmers like firecracker
rocket and funny girl and then you have
a bunch of mats in here and they blend
easily quickly and gorgeously and the
packaging is literally like alright
let's go ahead and talk about some Too
Faced palettes that I think blend really
really nicely the first two are there
9pn formula this little guy I was using
last week this is the peanut butter and
jelly palette I love this I think it
blends beautifully especially this
little shade right here in the middle
called peanut brittle so easy to work
into the crease I will say the shape
right here called nuts about you can be
a little tougher to work with it's
Matins kind of firmly pressed but
everything else you can create a really
nice quick warm tone i look with and it
does smell really really good and then
also the Too Faced totally cute eyes
shadow palette I feel like a lot of
people skimp on this one and they don't
want to purchase it because it basically
is just a bunch of jewel tones in here
as you can see but this is an amazing
amazing palette you guys honestly these
blend even better than any of the other
nine pan formulas so really really do
enjoy this if you are attracted to these
shades would definitely pick this up and
then also an oldie but a goodie and I
know a lot of people hate this palette
because it's like fallout galore but I
love my Too Faced the return of sexy
palette I thought it did the beyond of
sexy the return of sexy palette you guys
this is so incredibly good the mirror
keeps falling out of mine but I have had
this for years now these are so light
and airy and easy to blend you do have
Fallout galore so you need to make sure
that you do your eye makeup first and
then put on your face makeup but I love
these I feel like they blend so easily
and it's because they do have that
really light airy consistency or feel to
them so I adore this particular palette
and you guys can see you get like a
little smoky quad or Quint and then you
also get the purple ease and then also
the neutrals this is a really good old
school palette from Too Faced alright
next I do have another little quad from
Charlotte Tilbury now definitely let me
know
you guys would like to see oh I just
dropped one of them definitely let me
know if you guys would like to see a
video all about my favorite quads and
also my favorite trios because I have a
lot of trios and quads from the
drugstore and high-end this little guy
was sent to me for PR and this is the
sophisticate luxury palette and it is
just these four little matte shades
right here
and it is absolutely beautiful now like
I said if you want something very
similar to this or very similar to the
naked basics I would go ahead and pick
up the Physicians Formula one but I have
never felt like shadows especially matte
shadows this soft and buttery besides
like the lorac formula so if you love
that lorac Pro matte formula you would
absolutely adore this it is really
gorgeous very very compact and travel
friendly very very neutral but again if
your like a neutral everyday kind of
girl then you would absolutely love this
I feel like it would be perfect for a
work environment and then I also have
this little guy here from Too Faced that
I have to mention I forgot to talk about
him one of the best 9pn palettes as well
besides a totally cute 4 blend ability
is definitely the natural matte palettes
this literally blends itself you can
literally take this shade right here
which is called strapless which is one
of my favorites blend it together with
u-shaped chocolate cookie and you are
good to go like you just go back and
forth like two times and it's done you
guys can see I've made quite some dents
in some of the shades in here I don't
even know if you can tell but this is
beautiful everyday friendly absolutely
gorgeous I still love the natural eye
palette as well but the natural matte
there's something about these that are
so creamy and so buttery and so
luxurious and finally I have a little
palette here from bareMinerals that I
want to talk about bare minerals is one
of those brands that really doesn't
excite me all that often I'm going to be
talking about this brand of my next you
know brands that are boring me kind of
video but this is what it looks like
this is called the bare minerals ready
eyes shadow 8.0 formula the 8.0 is
impeccable that formula is amazing I
know they have the 2.0 they have the 3.0
go for the 8.0 this is called the power
neutrals palette and the shades are so
cute like the names are boss lady
and payday and like it does boardroom
all these cute little names but this is
what it looks like of course the shades
in here are very basic and neutral kind
of like bare minerals it has basic and
neutral but oh my goodness these are
soft they are creamy they are blendable
the mattes in here feel very similar to
the shimmers there
nicely pigmented but not overdone really
really good palette you can get this on
the sephora.com
website so anyway guys those are my no
fuss favorites for eyeshadow palette
like I said I really don't like to spend
a lot of time blending and there's
nothing wrong with that that is totally
a ok if you are also like that then you
know I definitely recommend going ahead
and picking up one of these palettes let
me know what you think down below also
let me know if you have some no-fuss
favourites that you want to share and
yeah that's pretty much it I guess I
will see you guys tomorrow for my review
and demo and swatches in comparison on
the new our rack locate from Anasazi of
Beverly Hills see you guys then pipe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
