my channel today I have a little bit of
a different video for you guys I'm going
to be talking about fall 2017 and makeup
trends now if you watched my video
yesterday you probably overheard and me
talking about the fact that I don't
really follow a lot of trends I used to
when I was in high school and also
college I definitely followed like hair
style trends as well as fashion trends
but never ever for makeup I've always
just done what I like however I will say
I was very intrigued by some of the
stuff that I was seen in photos from the
New York Fashion Week runway and I
thought it would be cool to kind of
incorporate some of those into like my
everyday routine so I thought I'd go
ahead and share with you guys what were
my favorite look said that I saw so
let's go ahead and start with lips the
first thing and that everybody was
rocking was a glossy lip and I am
totally into this everybody's been
talking about velocity lips in these
sort of videos and it is just it's so
true like every single one of the models
was wearing a glossy lip it doesn't
matter what color it is as long as it's
glossy and it looks juicy and beautiful
on the lips and that is very very in
right now another thing that I noticed
was kind of this 1920s ask shape for the
lips now and that's kind of if you were
to take concealer and kind of cover up
like the outer part of your mouth you're
left with this little like heart-shaped
lip thing and I used to actually shape
my lips this way when I was in college
if I can I'll go ahead and insert a
photo if I can find one I don't know if
they didn't have photos I'm doing my
lips like that anymore but I used to do
this all the time now the reason why I
did this was because it gives us really
pouty appearance and it's kind of like
dull like you know like like you have a
little dull mouth now I don't think this
is the trend that I'm going to follow I
really like lining my whole entire lips
now or just applying a lip color all
over my lips now and I'm not really that
great with lip liner anymore back in
college I was because I was using it
everyday but I don't really have that
many of my collection anymore but those
were the two things that I was seeing
the most when it comes to lips a very
very glossy lip as well as the little
1920s as kind of heart-shaped lips if
you will
alright let's go ahead and move on to
eyes the first one I wanted to talk
about is definitely not everyday
friendly but this was all over the
runway it's two toned eyeshadow now I
don't mean like one color on your lid
and one color in your crease I mean
literally you have
Green shadow over here and silver shadow
over here and now I know that there are
people that can pull this off I've seen
Jay kiss like here on YouTube do some
beautiful beautiful looks with different
colored eyeshadows on each eye I don't
think this is something I'm going to
incorporate into my everyday routine but
maybe you'll be fun to do for Halloween
or something like that now the more
wearable one that I was noticing on the
runway was definitely the smoldering
dark grey kind of muddy green smokey eye
now if we're so photos that I'm
inserting those are a little more our
bum guard yeah those are a little more
avant-garde if you will because of
course it's coming straight from the
runway they don't do a lot of blending
on purpose they just want it to be kind
of like okay there's the makeup now I
feel like if I dig into my Nubian to
palette from dubious place I will be
able to recreate some of those looks and
I really like that it's not like emerald
green colors or jewel tones it truly is
a dark dark smoldering smokey eye with a
little bit of green and a little bit of
gold so I feel like this bottom row here
from Julius place from the Nubian -
palette is gonna be great
I'm gonna go ahead and try and recreate
some of those looks but I yeah those
only two eyeshadow looks that I was seen
the most from the runway we're
definitely two toned eyeshadow as well
as the dark smoldering dark green kind
of smoky I love it all right now let's
go ahead and move on to something that I
feel like a beauty influencers have
really influenced as well as makeup
companies this is not something that was
really necessarily seen on the runway
but I think everybody's been talking
about the fact that colorful highlight
is going to be in for fall and winter
2017 so I have the Aurora glow kit right
here I think this would be great if you
wanted colorful highlights and you do
have more like a medium to deep
complexion and this would be awesome but
if you do have more of a sphere to light
complexion I would highly recommend the
moon child okay now if this will work
for any sort of complexion and if you
are very fair complected want to go for
the aurora that's totally fine as well
though whatever your little heart
desires but and this has just that
beautiful pastel sort of vibe going on
it's very pearlescent but you get that
little shift of color which is very very
in right now and then as far as the
aurora is concerned these definitely can
be blended more into
like an everyday sort of neutral natural
look they might look very very dark in
the pan but I promise you I have even
worn Orion before and I wore that to
work and I didn't have any issue so
colorful highlights are very in right
now and that's not necessarily because
of the runway it's more sort just
because of beauty influencers and also
just makeup brands releasing so many
colorful highlights but I'm totally into
the color highlight trend so I am down
with that one all right and then the
other thing that I was noticing it was a
demi matte skin on the runway and now
again I feel like a little bit of this
might be because of beauty brands
they're releasing a lot of Demi matte
foundations currently kind of like the
hooter beauty the new pro or is it foe
filter foundation I'm not getting that
cuz they're not cruelty free by also
linkage away it just released like a
demi matte foundation so basically what
I was noticing on the runway is these
models have really gorgeous looking skin
you can see a little bit of freckles
popping through but at the same time it
looked very perfected it wasn't overly
glossy their skin wasn't overly glossy
but I also wasn't overly matte where it
looked dry or flat it was just right in
between and it was like a nice solid
medium coverage on the skin so I think
that is definitely going to be in this
year and I'm totally I'm digging that
okay I like a nice medium coverage
lately I have been going for more sheer
to light coverage but I think I can
definitely go ahead and get on trend
with the demi mapped coverage and
finally guys the last thing I want to
talk about is one feature face enhancing
now and this is really interesting I'm
gonna go ahead and insert a photo of one
of the models and people always talk
about okay if you're gonna do a dark lip
do not do a dark smoky eye or if you're
gonna do a dark smoky eye do not do a
dark lip if the thing is is that they're
basically kind of flipping that around
and basically you enhance one area of
your face whether that be your eyebrows
whether that be your eyes or your actual
lips and then the rest you leave pretty
much completely natural now I know a lot
of people are not going to be into this
as you can see the model here I feel
like she had a little bit of brow
filling in she definitely was wearing
some concealer probably a light
foundation a little bit of a glowy skin
but not overly glowy you know kind of
like that did be matte thing going on
and then she just
that beautiful dark lip and it's
velocity and it's gorgeous and it really
brings emphasis to her other features
naturally it doesn't even look like she
was wearing mascara maybe like a clear
mascara or something like that but I
love the look of this so I am definitely
gonna go ahead and try and play this out
maybe fill in my brows a little bit do a
little bit of clear mascara or maybe one
a very light coat of a brown mascara and
then do a really glossy dark vampy lip
but I think that is a really cool trend
and I am I'm very excited so anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for joining me and I will
see you guys tomorrow for a very
exciting review on a new i shadow
palette from urban decay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
