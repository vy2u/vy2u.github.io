today's video is going to be a theory
requested video somebody requested that
I do a video on my favorite summertime
perfumes now I have a very large
fragrance collection I will link my
fragrance collection video down below if
you would like to check it out but I
have a lot of different perfumes a lot
of different body mists body sprays
things like that but I do tend to reach
for a certain sort of smelling you know
perfumes during the summer time so I
really like stuff that smells very
fruity I like very citrusy sense during
the summer time and I really like just
floral scents so let's go ahead and get
started the first one that I want to
talk about is from the brand and the
soft and this is called the solid
fragrance in the shade and not the shade
you know I talked about too much makeup
when I say shade in these scent Zazou
this is what it looks like and this is a
blend of lemongrass and jasmine I have
it on right now it smells absolutely
amazing if you love the scent of jasmine
you would absolutely adore this little
fragrance I wish they did have a spray
version I believe I got this in my
glossy box what you do is you just kind
of put it on to your pressure points you
rub together you can put it behind your
ears wherever you want but I do feel
like solid fragrances stay on the body a
lot longer and this particular scent is
just so nice like I said it smells
exactly like jasmine so if you are a big
three act like a big fan of the Jasmine
sort of sense you would absolutely adore
this and it does have a little bit of
lemongrass in there as well which gives
it a little bit of a tang alright so the
next story I want to talk about are from
the brand Pacifica Pacifica makes
amazing freakin perfumes everything is
made from like recyclables which is
awesome they don't have any lids on them
because they're trying to be better for
the environment and not waste a bunch of
stuff and yeah I think these are like
fifteen or twenty dollars on the auto
comm website the first one that I love
during the summertime is the Brazilian
mango grapefruit this literally smells
just like mango grapefruit I mean it's
just the two of those combined it's
amazing it really smells sweet and I
just love the actual fragrance it's just
so incredibly sweet all I smell in here
is mango and grapefruit so if that
sounds appealing to you you would love
this one I also really enjoyed the
Malibu eleven
but last time I wasn't Malibu Malibu
lemon blossom I do have a body miss that
I like to pair this with that I will
show you guys in a second but this is an
amazing scent there's a little bit of
Robina in here and then it really just
smells like lemon and a little bit of
sea salt like a beachside really really
nice perfume or really really nice
fragrance you definitely should check
this one out from Pacifica and then the
last one from Pacifica that I love to
use during the summertime is the
Tahitian gardenia this is a dupe for the
Marc Jacobs modern waar perfume which is
one of my all-time favorite perfumes
it's beautiful its sophisticated
and it just smells like gardenia this
one just smells straight up like
gardenia it's really beautiful if you
really do like that overpowering smell
of gardenia you would love this it
reminds me a lot it's one of those
fragrances if you don't know what
gardenia is it's one of those floral
fragrances where it's like when you
smell light lacs and you instantly know
it's lilac that's kind of like gardenia
you smell it and you instantly know it's
gardenia I don't know how else to
describe it but it just smells like pure
gardenia it's beautiful and very very
floral e perfect for the summer time
alright so the next one that I love
during the summertime and pretty much a
year-round is the versace bright crystal
i have a that i've described this scent
it's basically like Barbie's perfume or
like Elwood's like her perfume this is
something she would wear it just smells
so bright and funny it's got a really
expensive like base to it like that
makes no sense first of all it's
expensive but what I'm trying to say is
how's a very luxurious like high-end
perfume fragrance like those are the
under notes basically or at the
undertones and then I feel like on top
of that you get this mixture of verbena
you're getting lemon blossom you're
getting a little bit of Mandarin oil
you're just getting these really bright
notes and it just smells so good
this particular fragrance just makes me
happy when I'm wearing it and I just
feel very bubbly and cute when I have it
on I swear to you sometimes scents can
do that I believe in aromatherapy and I
really do feel like this is an uplifting
scent I love this one perfect for the
summertime
the next one is from Coach you guys know
I have a lot of these coach perfumes the
ones that have like the little ribbons
on them and think it's like that I think
I have seven in total again like I said
I will have my fragrance collection
video linked down below but this
particular one is
called the coach poppy flower block
blossom yes coach poppy flower blossoms
say that ten times fast
anyway this is a wonderful wonderful
fragrance you guys it smells really
really good
I believe there's a little bit of freixa
in here and also a little bit of lilac
it just smells like freesia and lilac
and mixed together with a little bit of
like an expensive perfume base again
you're getting that sort of Coach
signature scent and it just smells
amazing I really like the wear time on
this Coach one and also on the Versace I
feel like these wear all day long these
as you the LA stock perfume is really
really good as well since it's a solid
perfume I would say you do need to
reapply these particular ones the
Pacifica ones you do need to reapply
these throughout the day but the
strongest wear time I would say are
definitely like the Versace and the
coach and it's probably because they're
damn expensive it should last all day um
but anyway yeah this is really just a
blend of like lilac and freesia it
smells amazing really really good
perfume and then this one also is really
nice this again is from the Coach line
and this one is called beep Coach poppy
citrine blossom this one smells like
green tea I believe it has notes of
verbena in its lemongrass and also I
can't remember what the other one was I
should have just like looked up all the
notes but I'm trying to remember just by
smelling them what is smells like to me
basically is freshness lemongrass and
also green tea mixed together I'm gonna
layer it on top of the other one it
smells so good this is what I've been
wearing all week you guys I love it it's
just so fresh and nice if you really
really like those citrusy sort of
perfumes you would love this one so that
is the other one that I love now I am
going to talk about a few of body mists
that I absolutely adore during the
summertime the first one I've been
hearing this week with this particular
perfume and this is the Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works pleasures white tea and ginger
body splash this smell is pretty much
exactly like that perfume it just has
this really really nice scent to it
I feel like ginger and like lemongrass
and white teeth are very very fresh and
kind of bright like citrusy sort of
notes and I just feel like this
particular body mist it's wonderful it
pairs beautifully with a lot of the
other perfumes that I shared with you
guys just now and then I have a body
mist that I use every single year during
the summer
this is from Victoria's Secret it is
their fragrance mates that their
fragrance mist in mango temptation you
guys can see this is very well-loved I
have about this much left if this is so
sweet smelling oh my god I'm going to
stink after this it's not spraying all
of these on me but you guys this is the
epitome of summer for me this smells so
good I know a lot of people are obsessed
with love spell and secret charm and all
these different scents from the
Victoria's Secret line but mango
temptation is the best one in my opinion
there's another one to you that smells
really good it's called pear glass a I
believe or something like that I do like
that during the summer time as well but
this one Trump's them all all right and
then I have one final body mist I want
to talk about it is not summertime
without this particular body mist um
this is the body shop Satsuma body mist
this smells like you literally just cut
oh my god it smells like you just cut
open oranges that's exactly what this
smells like it smells like oranges and I
don't mean like oh it kinda smells like
oranges it literally smells like a fresh
orange like you just cut one open I
recently did pick up the body shops
which is this called Vineyard peach
cream body scrub and I like the peach
scent from the body shop but nothing
Trump's their Satsuma that this is the
best fragrance that they have I swear to
you if you love a citrusy scent you have
to check this out so I absolutely adore
that so anyway those are some of my
favorites like summer perfumes that n
body mists and I guess just fragrances
in general that I like to use during the
summer time thank you so much for
joining me guys and I will see you
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
