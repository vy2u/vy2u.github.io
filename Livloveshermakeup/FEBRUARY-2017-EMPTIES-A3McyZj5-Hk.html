my channel today's video is going to be
my February 2017 empties so if you are
interested in seen I feel like the white
focus is completely off right now hold
on come on camera you could do it oh
jeez it looks so yellow anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed this video let's go
ahead and jump right into it what was I
gonna say oh yeah if you're interested
in seed the products that I used up this
month and also a few that Tom used up
then please keep on watching alright so
the first item that we have here is from
the Sephora collection this is the
supreme cleansing oil with cottonseed
and this does have 6.4 fluid ounces for
around at fifteen dollars that's what it
retails for um the sephora.com website
this is fabulous the only reason why i
would not repurchase is because the
Sephora collection does tests on animals
and i'm going cruelty free if you are
not cruelty free I would recommend this
I think it's beautiful
you put it onto dry skin you massage it
all around and then you rinse off with a
water and it completely will rinse your
makeup off so really really good product
right here but like I said I won't
repurchase another item I won't
repurchase was actually sent to me for
PR this is from Aussie it is the total
miracle dry shampoo 7 miraculous
benefits in every single bottle I do
like the smell of this but I do feel
like it makes my hair a little bit tacky
and kind of sticky which I'm not a huge
fan of so I would not personally
repurchase but it really does give kind
of the benefits of like having a hair
spray so it will hold your actual hair
style and also it does help with oil
alright so the next item is be simple
micellar cleansing water this is my
all-time favorite cleansing water I'm
not quite sure if simple is a cruelty
free brand I need to look that up I
found kind of like mixed opinions on
that but yeah this is a beautiful
beautiful micellar cleansing water I
like that it completely removes my
makeup it doesn't sting my eyes it's
really really nice product if it is not
cruelty free that is okay because
Pacifica also makes a really nice
cleansing water called the kale tonic I
think Caleb cleansing tonic yeah and I
do really like that one so that's
totally okay but yeah this one is really
really good would recommend alright I
did use up this little Burberry Eau de
Parfum spray right here this is one of
my all-time favorite fragrances would
not repurchase though because I'm
fortunately Burberry does dust on
animals and it's very hard to find
fragrances that are not tested on
animals but it smells really good if you
are not cruelty free it's a very sexy
and sophisticated sense that I think a
lot of women would like alright we did
use up both
and I used up these Charlotte Lacroix
products so these were also sent to the
for PR the first one is the red T serum
this is for all skin types we really
really like this I would repurchase this
with my own of money and I would buy it
for myself I really liked the
consistency of it a lot of a serums are
very slimy feeling this one was like a
gel consistency absorbed into the skin
almost immediately and I really did like
what it did for my skin so I thought
that was great I would repurchase that
and then for Tom we probably would
repurchase these Charlotte Lacroix
activating night creme he really liked
this it didn't make him break out it
does have Argan stem cells in it and a
Charlotte Lacroix is a cruelty free
brand and they are pretty much all
natural ingredients very very short
ingredients list as well so he really
liked that and we would probably
repurchase for him alright I did go
through one of my la vanilla be healthy
deodorants I like the scent right here
which is called pure vanilla right now I
have the vanilla grapefruit one these
are fantastic you guys if you are
someone who does deal with an autoimmune
disease I would highly recommend cutting
out aluminum products so if you have
aluminum and you're putting it right
underneath your armpits where you have
all those glands and things like that
it's just not healthy for your body my
lupus doctor or my rheumatologist I
should say really really recommended
that I stay away from anything with
aluminum so I would highly recommend
this it's not an antiperspirant it is
not going to help like keep you wetness
free if that makes sense but it is going
to help with like how you smell
throughout the day and things like that
so it is good it did take a little bit
of getting used to but I do love it now
alright I did use up this Bath and Body
Works winter candy apple antibacterial
hand gel maybe or maybe would not
repurchase I'm still looking into Bath
and Body Works a lot of people when you
first type in like is bad the Body Works
cruelty free it basically says no we are
not cruelty free but I've been doing
even further research and and they look
like they are or they're transitioning
to go and cruelty free so still
undecided on that if they are still
currently testing on animals will not
repurchase even though you guys know I
love Bath &amp;amp; Body Works but if they are
transitioning then maybe I will continue
purchasing their products I haven't made
my mind up yet here we have these really
crows water balancing this this is one
of my all-time favorite facial mists
would not repurchase it really does
tests on animals however I will say that
the last three times that I've used this
I feel like they have changed up the
ingredients because I have been getting
rashes on my face now that is very very
strange it has happened with the
last two bottles and this has been like
my all-time favorite facial mists of
life for pretty much over a year and a
half now so very very strange just be
careful if you aren't very sensitive I
don't know what's going on it feels like
the fragrance is a little more
overpowering that it used to be it's a
very very strong rose smell which I love
yeah I don't know I've been getting
rashes the last two times so I'm gonna
have to probably go back to my Mario
Badescu one I think my vanessa is pretty
brave all right here are viciously no
facial accountants would not repurchase
this a doe does tests on animals these
are just obviously facial Cotton's but I
just don't want to purchase from the
brand so I'm not going to repurchase
this but I have heard that there are
plenty of cruelty-free dupes out there I
will let you guys know when I find one
they are really good very very soft and
like just so much softer than a normal
cotton pad or cotton ball I just have to
say it alright I did use that this
little talkest and moan and perfume
spray this is what I brought when we
traveled to Hawaii it smelled amazing
taka
I believe it's actually cruelty-free
which is awesome and oh the fragrance is
just so nice you guys it's a very very
beachy scent and I really do it like it
all right moving on I did use up this
little Sephora
I'm waterproof eye makeup remover this
was extremely extremely oily did not
like this would not repurchase so yeah
did not like that
it was just too oily I know that those
waterproof eye makeup removers have to
have some oil in them but that almost
like the kind of oil where it's like
this thin greasy layer left on your skin
after which I really don't like alright
here we have the essence all about Matt
fixing compact powder at love essence
love this particular powder would
repurchase already have repurchased um
let's see here here we have the title
brightening enzyme water cream from
Sunday Riley this was just a little
sample I am looking into getting a
full-size of this I saw they also do
having new moisturizer Coffee CEO I have
not heard very good reviews and the fact
that they put on vitamin C is like an
open container like that is super stupid
in my opinion but for some reason Sunday
Riley is claiming that it can still be
used and it will still absorb into your
skin but usually when you're using a
vitamin C product you need something
that's sealed in a little better not
just something that's exposed to the air
like that I'm oh I'm a little rants but
anyway a long story short this is
fantastic really does help with
hyperpigmentation it does have let's see
here
hyaluronic acid alpha are bitter rum and
enzymes whatever that means
it's really good yeah all right so next
I did use up the it cosmetics brush bath
um this is a really really nice spot
cleaner I would repurchase this it
cosmetics is a cruelty-free brand
however they were currently are not
currently they were previously bought
out by L'Oreal but they do not test on
animals themselves and to me that is
cruelty free so I would repurchase it is
a little bit on the oily side but it's
not something that drives me absolutely
not so yes would repurchase that and I
love the packaging let's see here I have
some more bath and Bodyworks hand soaps
like I said unsure about Bath and Body
Works at this point we have the winter
citrus wreath which is a beautiful
balsam wreath accented with fresh citrus
and gingerbread latte which is let's see
here warm Gingerbread vanilla latte and
whipped creams of those smell amazing
here we have a Glade cancel I got this
in my pop sugar must-have box last month
and this is coconut beach woods it
actually smelled quite good and Glade
has like this new fancy packaging it
smelled a lot like a bath and Bodyworks
Campbell is really nice if you're a used
up a candle called bergamot woods this
is from the DL C company which actually
is a cruelty-free candle company however
I do find that this did not have a very
strong scent throw so I would personally
not repurchase that I am going to go
ahead and decant this and keep the
little container here at probably store
some makeup brushes in there I did use
up this little a little Estee Lauder
revitalizing supreme a global anti-aging
creme this is a beautiful beautiful
beautiful anti-aging creme if you were
not cruelty-free I do think it's
something that you might like
but Estee Lauder does huge amounts of
animal testing so I cannot support them
alright let's see here three week
handles tis the season from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works one of my all-time favorite
candles spiced apple toddy also smells
incredible marshmallow fireside this one
is absolutely beautiful as well I
actually used up two of those and then
finally the last candle is another his
the season so anyway guys those are all
the empties that I have for February
2017 I would love to know what you guys
used up it down below what you really
liked what you really didn't like and
yeah that's pretty much it I will see
you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
