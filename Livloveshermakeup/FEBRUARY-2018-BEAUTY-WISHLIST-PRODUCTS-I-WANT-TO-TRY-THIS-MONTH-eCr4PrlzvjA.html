my channel today I am walking you guys
through my February 2018 a beauty
wishlist these are products that I
really would like to pick up this month
and they have caught my attention they
are drawing me in they will have an anti
haul going up for you guys sue and
probably in a better week or so where I
talk about products I won't be buying
this month but yeah let's talk about
some products that are on my wish list
that I most likely will be purchasing
the first one is from Becca cosmetics
this is brand new and I haven't really
been on Instagram but I have been
checking once a day just to make sure I
can keep up with trends post so I did
see that Becca cosmetics is coming out
with a Parisian highlight and this looks
absolutely stunning you can see that it
does have the Eiffel Tower imprinted
onto it you also have little stars
around it the only thing that's kind of
confusing me is that the photo that
Becca release at first is the photo that
the beauty vlogger in collaboration with
this product released look very very
different to me the Becca's photo looks
very very peachy with a lot of gold
reflex in it and then this one looks
more of like the pinky base with a lot
of gold sheen to it so either way I am
quite interested in it if I do pick up
the other two highlighters that I'm
gonna mention in this video maybe I'll
pass on this one
but you guys know I love Becca cosmetics
highlighters I recently did a video
showing you guys my Becca singles I have
them all stored behind me there is no
longer any room left on the little tray
behind me so maybe I'll leave this one
off the wish list there are other
highlighters that I'm more interested in
but still I wanted to talk about this
one and I might end up purchasing it
we'll see alright guys let's move on to
a new product from tatcha so I'm not the
biggest fan of Tosh of skincare it's not
that I don't think they're good products
I just personally feel like they're very
very expensive for what they are now it
looks like Tasha is getting into a
makeup now and I am interested and I
would like to at least try out one of
their makeup products so this is the new
what is it called the silk canvas filter
finished protective primer it is fifty
two dollars which is very very expensive
so I'm gonna see if I can use some sort
of coupon code when I picked this up
whether it be on the toxidrome website
or wherever else this is going to be
sold it looks like it's already
available but it says that it blurs the
look of pores fine lines and uneven skin
tone it prime
was silk powder for long-lasting
flawless makeup and it protects the skin
from makeup pollution so I like
everything that's kind of going on with
that I don't really have like a bald
primer where I kind of rub my fingers in
it and then just kind of tap it on where
I want to I thought this would be nice
for just kind of priming areas where I
know are very troublesome throughout the
day so areas where my makeup tends to
crease or where I have big pores or
underneath my eyes so I'm interested in
picking this up I know it's a very very
expensive but let me know if you guys
want a review on that let's move on to a
new foundation from cover FX this is the
new power play cover FX power play
foundation is that right yes power play
foundation this is a high-performing
along wearing a modern matte foundation
now that does kind of scare me a little
bit I'm not into matte foundations very
much right now but a lot of people were
saying it's more like right in the
middle so a little bit satiny a little
bit matte and it looks like they are
releasing 40 shades right off the bat
which is great it says design for women
on the go and delivers color true
all-day wear with powerful shine control
they are vegan and cruelty free and they
will be a $44 a piece here in the US
which is awesome so I am definitely
thinking of going ahead and scooping one
of these up let me know if you guys want
a foundation of Friday on this but it
looks very interesting to me love the
shade range looks really good the
swatches look great so I'm excited for
that alright guys up next we have yet
another highlight now this one is really
calling my name
although I do personally feel like this
might not be the best color for me when
I am cell tanned and this is the new
over a cosmetics pillow talk highlighter
I love the over cosmetics highlighter
formulas they are like a powder finish
but really really beautiful they never
emphasize fine lines and texture or
anything like that in this area or even
my pores when I take it down to the
apples of my cheeks but that's what I'm
to do with my highlighter they look
beautiful on the skin they give that
blinding sort of effect without being
like a big Chalet sort of highlight so
it never looks like they're sitting on
top of the skin you really can buff them
in and really make them look like one
with your skin so I'm very excited for
this and the only thing that's kind of
inching me away is the fact that this
does seem to have a really reflective
white base when I'm self tan it really
doesn't look good on my skin it just
really really doesn't the self-tanner
that I use which is the hemp subdeacon
the self-tanner but that one tends to
pull a lot of all of the undertones so
if you guys have
notice that my skin tone looks more warm
or more like all of your more cool tone
it just depends on if I'm wearing
self-tanner or not so I'm not quite sure
if this is going to be great when I am
wearing self-tanner but when I'm not
wearing self-tanner this is totally the
kind of highlight I would go for it
looks like it's kind of cool tone it's
got a little bit of pinky iridescence
going on so I am very much interested in
that highlight as well all right guys
let's move on to the watermelon pink
juice and moisturizer this is a new from
a Gallo recipe so I believe I believe I
have tried out the glow recipe
watermelon sleeping mask I think I
returned it just before I'm pretty sure
I returned it in fact I think I did talk
about it and one of my beauty returns
videos so that was an interesting
product because I just didn't feel like
it gave enough moisture to my skin I
really did try to get it to work but
after about two weeks of using it I
noticed it was just not doing anything I
had only used it three or four times
before I returned it to see you guys
know always get people up my ass about
returns but it was just one of those
products I didn't really notice a lot
going on however this guy right here
even though it is claiming to be a
moisturizer I have different I have
different ways of how I want to
personally use this I would like to use
this as an emulsion I feel like it would
be really nice because it looks like
it's sort of like a jelly a buoyant
consistency but it still gives a little
bit of moisturizer which is what I look
for with emulsions and what I look for
with essences and now it's very hard to
find cruelty free essences as well as
emulsion so I'm thinking of purchasing
this let me know if you've tried it out
it does say it is good for normal oily
combination and sensitive skin and I
will say when I tried out the mask it
was very cooling and nice on the skin so
we'll see how this goes again if I have
a really not so great feeling about it
like it's gonna be too close to the
watermelon glow sleeping mask obviously
won't purchase it but it is on my radar
and I'm thinking of using it as an
emulsion and finally guys we have the
Emily Z a beautiful golden sand dunes
highlight and this is going to be
available on February 14th it is a
collaboration with Anasazi Beverly Hills
you guys know I'm obsessed with them and
I can't see him obsessed with emrys's
she's beautiful she's hot I do follow
her on Instagram so I feel so weird ever
don't like she's hot but you've got hot
so I do follow her on Instagram and
she's a beautiful girl and I love the
way she does her makeup I know some
people feel like she's a little
aggressive I
I've seen some of her like snapchat
rants and things like that but I mean
she's who she is nothing I could do
about that so I can't say that I admired
her a bad bitch behavior it's not
something that really personally rubs me
the wrong way but I know that it does
rub some people the wrong way so they're
not going to support this collaboration
I love anasazi of Beverly Hills and this
looks like the beautiful beautiful
perfect gold champagne color I'm excited
to try out this formula here because it
does look very different and very new
for Anasazi of Beverly Hills incredibly
pigmented gorgeous packaging so if I
were to put all three highlighters that
I talked about in this video in like a
categories of like what I'm gonna buy
first and what I'm gonna buy laughs I
would say amber easy highlight then
pillow-talk and then the Becca
highlighters so anyway guys those are
the products on my beauty wish list for
February 2018 as always these are just
on my wish list that doesn't necessarily
mean I'm going to purchase all of them
it's just what has kind of caught my
attention and is on my radar so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video let me know
down below if you have any products that
you put on your wish list are you gonna
buy any of these guys that I mentioned
in this video and I guess I'll see you
guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
