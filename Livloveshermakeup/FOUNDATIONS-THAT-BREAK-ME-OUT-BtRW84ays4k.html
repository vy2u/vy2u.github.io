was super high-pitched anyway welcome
back to my channel I hope you guys are
having a fantastic Saturday I know I am
so far I slept all like 10 a.m. which is
great so anyway I hope you guys are
having a good weekend so far I am here
to do a viewer requested video today and
I'm super super excited because you can
probably tell I feel like I'm gonna blow
up and confetti skin a pop out all over
but anyway I'm super excited she
requested that I go ahead into a video
on foundations that break me out and I
thought that was a great video idea
because I actually have six foundations
in my collection then make me break out
like elbow okay
like really really really make me break
out and it's so funny because the only
reason I hold on to them is because I
have found a secret ingredient that I
put on before I put these foundations on
and it completely combats the breakouts
so I will share that secret ingredient
at the end so if you're watching this
video and you're like why would you hold
on to foundations then make you break
out it's because I have found something
that really helps combat the breakouts
um anyway before we get into this I do
want to say there is a foundation in
this video that I'm sharing with you
guys that is one of my top 5 Holy Grail
foundations and I will be making a video
in the next like week or two about my
top 5 top 5 series for my favorite
foundations I want to see if you guys
can guess which one it is down below so
let me know in the comment section down
below and I think that's everything that
I wanted to say let's go ahead and get
right into it I'm gonna share with you
guys the foundations that make me break
out alright the first one that makes me
break out is the cap on the locket
tattoo foundation the shades that I have
are like 42 and light 44 I mix these
together to get my perfect shade I think
this just makes me break out because
they have a very thick heavy texture to
them so they kind of sit on the skin
they're ultra ultra pigmented great if
you have like oily or combo skin for the
most part just because like people with
oily or combo skin tend to have a little
more texture or breakouts this really
really covers well okay but the
only thing I don't like it that
times I feel like it's plastered on my
face and then my skin starts to get
irritated and my t-zone where I have
lots of oil production because they do
have combo skin starts to go crazy and
over produces sebum or oil and then
those oils start making the breakouts so
this is the worst foundation that makes
me break out the second one is the Mac
Studio sculpt SPF 15 foundation my shade
is NC 15 and this makes me break out
like crazy you guys I don't know what it
is this is the one foundation that even
when I use my secret ingredient I still
do get a little bit of breakouts so I
don't know if I would ever repurchase
this I don't think I will
and honestly I have heard so many
horrible things about Mac Foundation's
breaking people out you guys know I'm
already not the hugest fan you just I'm
not the biggest fan of mac cosmetics
okay I do like their blushes I hate
their lipsticks I'm not a huge fan of
their eyeshadows sorry just being honest
but I can't say that I'm really a huge
fan of their foundations either although
this foundation sticks beautifully on
the skin and hydrates it really starts
to bother my hormonal acne and absolute
not like that so that is the second
foundation that makes me break out
the third one is from hard candy this is
the hard candy glamoflauge invisible
camouflage foundation in the shade 930
porcelain this is about a shade lighter
than me I need to get a shade darker but
anyway this is a beautiful kind of like
Demi matte gorgeous sort of satiny
finish foundation that I really really
enjoy but there's something in there
some sort of ingredient I feel like it
has a little bit of oils or something in
there that just bother my skin so yeah
that makes me break out another one that
makes me break out is the elf flawless
finish foundation with SPF 15 sunscreen
my shade is porcelain and I'm not quite
sure what it is in here it has a
beautiful beautiful finish this is a
gorgeous foundation but there's
something in here that does the
irritates my skin it makes my breakout
the next one I really wish didn't break
me out because this is like a beautiful
beautiful foundation which by the way
it's not one of my top five I didn't
just give away it's not one of the top
five but it is a beautiful foundation it
is the Estee Lauder Double Wear stay in
place makeup in the shade one and one
I've renewed beautiful beautiful really
gives the kind of coverage that the cap
on d1 gives without feeling like you
have plasters of like I don't know
Cement on your face I really love the
don't get me wrong I love the Kat Von D
but this one is just like eight more
like light version but it still gets the
same coverage really really awesome
product I don't know if it's just
because it is a little heavier on the
skin that it makes me break out for
whatever reason it does and then the
last one I want to talk about is the
L'Oreal visible lift blur foundation I
really love this foundation it's
beautiful on the skin and the she I have
is called 201 the light ivory really
really beautiful on the skin but you
just failed with silicones and that
makes it super easy to blend like
literally you can blend this in with
your fingers okay like it's gorgeous you
really can blend it quickly but I don't
know I'm starting to think it is some
sort of silicone ingredients in here
that makes me sensitive but I don't know
if it's that because honestly I love
silicone primers dimecaco and all that
kind of stuff have a lot of those
ingredients in my makeup and or in my
primers at least and those never make me
break down so I don't really know I
don't really know if it's like the
doméstico nor silicones in here that
makes me break out but it makes me break
out and oh the last thing I want to say
before I tell you guys the little secret
ingredient the last thing I want to say
is that I do plan on printing out a list
of all the ingredients on these
foundations and trying to Kim point
exactly what it is because I wonder if
they all have something in common that
would be very interesting all right now
on to the product that helps me from
breaking out with these products so it
is Seles Dilek acid I know that sounds
like a really really basic bitch
seriously fellas Solek acid
I have hormonal acne you know I've
talked about it a lot I did it along my
jawline and my cheekbones and things
like that and normally benzoyl peroxide
is the answer to my prayers when it
comes to those kind of big like cysts
and things like that but salicylic acid
if I wear a cèlle silicic acid products
before before putting on pretty much any
of these foundations
I will admit the Mac one I still kind of
do tend to get breakouts with which
again there's probably why you won't
repurchase but all of the other ones if
I use these cells to look acid product
before putting them on I swear to you
know write doubts
it just completely stops them in their
tracks so you can use salicylic acid in
plenty of different forms I have this
cover effects madam
I'm primer with anti acne treatments in
it this has I believe 0.5% salicylic
acid in it the oil minimizing clean
toner from Olay is really nice as well
if you have sensitive skin stay away
because it's highly fragrance but I
believe this has witch hazel and 1%
salicylic acid in it
also the oil-free acne stress control
toner from Neutrogena is great - this
one has 2% salicylic acid in it and if
you prefer to just go in with like a
lightweight gel this Shiseido Ibuki
multi solution channa is a great option
as well so if I use these and then I put
on these foundations
it's just compacts the breakouts which
is absolutely awesome so I hope you guys
enjoy this video on foundations that
break me out even if salicylic acid
doesn't help you with foundations that
make you break out hopefully you can at
least stay away from some of the ones
that I showed in this video so thanks
for joining me guys
and I will see you tomorrow for my
finals and how to rails</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
