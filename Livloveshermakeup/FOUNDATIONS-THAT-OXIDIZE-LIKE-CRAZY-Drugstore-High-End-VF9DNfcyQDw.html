my channel today's video is going to be
all about foundations that oxidize like
crazy this is a viewer requested video
so I am extra excited to go ahead and
fill it for you guys
and ya know let's go ahead and jump
right into it I have some drugstore and
also high-end foundations here to share
with you guys foundations that oxidize
are not necessarily a deal-breaker for
me I do have two that I am going to
declutter and I'll save those for the
end for you guys but the other ones are
really good so please don't feel like
I'm trying to bash this particular
product or any of these foundations in
fact some of them are my favorites like
the Urban Decay all nighter even though
it oxidizes like crazy it is a favorite
of mine so please don't think I'm trying
to bash them it's just one of those
things that is very very annoying no
matter what sort of skin tone you have
this skin tone you have you've probably
dealt with a foundation or some sort of
makeup product changing colors
throughout the day oxidation can happen
very very rapidly within five minutes of
applying again kind of like this guy
right here or it can happen throughout
the day
basically oxidation just occurs when a
bead makeup that you are wearing on your
face comes in contact with the air so
normally obviously foundations are kind
of stored in packaging like this where
they are not exposed to the air they're
not exposed to sunlight they're not
exposed to the wind we put them on our
face we go outside and suddenly they
change so they can change in texture
consistency can change they can change
in color the most frequent thing that I
notice is that my foundation will go
very very pink or very very orange so
anyway now let's go ahead and jump right
in so the new foundations that
definitely oxidize like crazy so the
first one this is the worst culprit as
far as oxidation is concerned in my
collection this is the Urban Decay all
nighter waterproof long-wearing liquid
foundation
I do Worthy shade 0.5 and I did a first
impressions on this I will go ahead and
link it down below you can literally see
this oxidizing on my face I put on you
know the products on like the left side
of my face and as I was working on the
right side of my face it darkened up
like two shades I would say by the end
of the day I am 5 shades darker when I'm
wearing this foundation and I feel
worthy shades 0.5 which is the lightest
out of I believe like 20 or 24 so if you
are going to pick this up I would highly
highly recommend if your various are
complected go ahead and use the white
mixer but if you are not very complected
and you do have the option of choosing a
lighter shade I would go two shades
lighter alright the next one I want to
talk about is from the drugstore it is
be Neutrogena how
being that liquid makeup this does have
broad-spectrum SPF 20 sunscreen in it
and I do wear the shade at classic ivory
number 10
I find that Neutrogena has a really
shitty shade selection as far as their
foundations are concerned I feel like a
lot of foundations from the drugstore
need to work on their shade selection
but there are plenty of high-end brands
that I also need to work on their shade
selection so I feel like they really
cater to the in-between or the middle
skin tone kind of shades a lot of their
lighter shades and their darker shades
just don't work and I just find that all
their foundations go very very yellow on
me it does apply point yellow on my skin
but then it starts to darken up
throughout the day I definitely have to
mix it with a white mixer but it's
unfortunate because a lot of white
mixtures will change the finish of the
foundation so this is a beautiful
beautiful finish very very similar to
like the NARS sheer glow which I have
tried a sample of this is very similar
so I never ended up picking up the NARS
sheer glow but unfortunately when I do
mixes together with a white mixer it
completely changes the center so it's
unfortunate I can never get this to work
the way I want it to work and I have
gone through three bottles of this I
know I rarely talk about it on my
channel but that is because I just can't
get the shade to work so anyway that is
definitely something I would recommend
picking up a shade lighter and another
one that I would recommend picking up a
sheet or two lighter in is definitely
the Clinique beyond perfecting
foundation plus concealer now this was
kind of a funny story so I thought be
second to leg a shade which is called
0.5 breathe I should have just gotten
0.0 which is called linen a lot of the
people as a clinic counters when I got
this about a year ago they will tell you
because this is so hot heavily pigmented
it will go on darker than your skin tone
and then lighten up throughout the day I
noticed that but then I noticed this
starts to oxidize very very pink on my
skin so I should have gotten the
lightest shade I believe the lady at
clinic and trust me they are right it
really does go on to your skin quite
dark and then it will lighten up for a
little bit but then it goes dark
throughout the day for me personally so
this is something I would also recommend
getting a shade or two lighter in
alright next is the covergirl clean
matte BB cream now they don't have a
very good selection to begin what they
think they have like eight shades but
the lighter shade is called 5/10 layer
and this is a really good BB cream
American BB cream I should say it has
very good coverage very similar to what
you would find overseas that good kind
of coverage I feel like a lot of baby
creams are from the drugstore have
really crappy and
is like they feel like they're like a
like not even a secret they just feel
like they're er a like tainted
moisturizer like no coverage to their
whatsoever but this one is really really
good
it does go on a little dark and then it
seems to go like rapidly just get darker
and darker throughout the day so I would
highly recommend picking up a shade
lighter if you are going to get this but
it is beautiful very very good coverage
and if you do have oily skin I would
recommend this one and then finally the
last few that I want to talk about are
the ones I am decluttering and I'm
really sad to see this one go this is
the elf flawless finish foundation with
SPF 15 sunscreen I wish they made a
shade lighter in this the shade I do
wear is called porcelain and I love
everything about this I love the finish
of it I love the wear time I love the
bottle of the gorgeous its frosted glass
bottle it has a pump this is like a
luxurious foundation you guys I'm not
even kidding
else is cruelty free I want to love this
product but no matter what I do if I mix
it with this white mixer foundation I
have a Mac one that I don't really love
but I even if I mix it with that one or
any other that I try and play around
with I cannot get this to stop going to
yellow throughout the day if that makes
sense it just gets darker and darker on
my skin I have tried powdering
throughout the day really trying to
lighten it up with really really like
white powders it just doesn't work which
is such a shame because it is beautiful
so if you can get your hands on this and
you can go lighter in shade selection I
would highly recommend picking this up
it is a beautiful foundation and then
finally on also decluttering this one
this is the Maybelline Dream velvet soft
matte hydrating foundation I did pick up
two different shades the two lightest
one was called like warm ivory which was
0-5 and this one is number 10 of
porcelain ivory this goes so crazy pink
on my face throughout the day it is
absolutely ridiculous I cannot get it to
work even with a white mixer I tried
everything and then the warm ivory one
or the warm porcelain goes way to yellow
tone so that's really unfortunate I do
notice that is a trend with Maybelline
foundations for me personally but yeah I
would recommend picking up one shade
lighter if you do want to pick this up
and you have the option of going lighter
in shade selection so anyway that is it
as far as the foundations oxidize like
crazy for my skin I hope that this will
be helpful for you guys the next time
you're in the drugstore or at Ulta or at
Sephora maybe you can remember okay
Liz said that those oxidized I should
get a shade lighter definitely let me
know down below is any of these oxidized
on you if
oxidize on you of course we are all
different and in different products
react differently on different skin
tones or different skin types I should
say
but yeah I would love to know if you
guys have a list of foundations that
oxidize for you please let us know down
below so that we can learn something as
well and yet that is pretty much it I
will see you guys tomorrow so look at
the week and my 30k subscriber giveaway
