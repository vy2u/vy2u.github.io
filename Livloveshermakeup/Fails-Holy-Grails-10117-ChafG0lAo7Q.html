my channel I welcome back to my place
and have a BIOS where I share with you
guys the products I have been loving
this week and the Parsee products I have
not been a living now I'm going to look
like a hot mess it's because I kind of
have a hot mess ok I just got back from
a gig this morning flying back from LA
and I don't know it's just kind of like
I was on the plane you know cookie when
you get off a plane I was on the plane
we went out we did some shopping today's
92 degrees here it's super super
hot for whatever reason and yeah I don't
feel I don't feel so hot I also woke up
with like 10 at milling and big
zits all over my face so it's just been
a great day a great day anyway let's go
ahead and took her to the bails and holy
grails I'm gonna start with the fail for
the week it is a product that was sent
to me for PR and this is from the brand
of cosmetics now they are more of like a
luxury and cruelty-free skincare company
and this is their a firm antioxidant
firming a serum I have been using this
on my decollete as well as my neck area
and I actually do like it for that
however for the face this is not
anything special you guys I feel like
there are way better serums out there
for a better price
I definitely feel it like it firms a
little bit but I also said that I was
supposed to be slightly illuminating and
hydrating and I did not notice that
whatsoever so that is the feel for the
week would not recommend to you guys
that are much better serums on the
market even ones that you can pick up
that are cruelty free at the drugstore
you guys should do a video all about
drugstore skincare I think that will be
up next all right now let's go ahead and
jump into the holy grails the first one
is my Becca a Jaclyn hill champagne
collection face palette I know you can't
purchase this anymore but I love
it it's a great palette I really really
enjoy it and as you guys can see I'm
actually working on panning this guy
right here which is champagne a pop now
I saw that they are coming out with a
2017 holiday palette that you guys know
I will be scooping up and reviewing for
you but I just love this palette you get
one of the luminous flush solutions then
a luminous flush blushes you get
to move the mineral blushes as well as
Prosecco pop and champagne pop crescendo
pop even though I'm self-tans right now
is still a little too like a yellow tone
to me it's kind of like a stripe of
yellow but if you mix the two together
it looks absolutely beautiful and I just
really have been enjoying champagne pop
now that I'm a little a tan so I'm
thinking of going ahead and purchasing a
full-size of champagne pop as well but
yeah that has been my go to face palette
the whole entire week of the next life
you have
smash or basically like a face peel here
that I have had in my collection for a
while I purchased this back when I lived
in New York it says that the shelf life
still has like another 6 months so I
need to use this up pretty quickly but
it is from Alba Botanica this is called
be good and clean a fruit acid detox
fusion it is a pore purifying it horror
purify you mini peel it is an oil-free
gel and basically you put it on your
skin you leave it on for 1 to 6 minutes
depending on how much your skin can
handle I used to be able to do the full
6 minutes when I had more oily combo
skin about right now I can only handle
about 1 minute of this it really starts
to tingle and I just feel like it really
really kind of frees my pores I feel
like no matter what products I put on
after this they really sink in properly
and also it really does help with like a
little bit of breakouts it helps with
just clearing up congested skin in
general and I really do like that it
exfoliates as well so I have been
enjoying this this has definitely been
like a top 5 in my collection as far as
face masks are concerned alright guys up
next I have some products here that were
also set to a PR these are from at the
depth of Scarlett brand I don't know if
you guys have heard of this but this is
basically like a subscription a pallet
service that you can get that's cruelty
free every single month so this
particular one is called edition at
number 4 and now I did not go into this
with high hopes because my friend Keeley
here on YouTube I'll go ahead and link
her channel down below I remember her
talking about how she did not like the
eyeshadows in these particular palettes
and this particular edition number 4
came with like a little double ended lip
product I do not like this whatsoever in
fact I don't like any of the lip
products in this particular palette but
I do enjoy the eyeshadows which I
thought was interesting so to each their
own right but this is what the actual
lip product looks like beautiful
beautiful color this is kind of like it
a beagle aussi a lipstick you guys can
see full hot pigment here okay
really really beautiful overall but I
will say even with the lip liner which
is right there and this believes outside
of the old light lips a little time like
a lot so I mean if you're somebody who
really really is self-conscious about
having lipstick I bleed all over your
teeth throughout the day bleed upside
the lip line this is going to do that
I'm already really bad with applying lip
product so this was just a no-no for me
and then inside of the palette which is
actually really well made and beautiful
you do have a two of a little lip
products right here I felt the same
exact way with these I just felt like
they were too humectant and too oily and
I know that's really interesting because
I'm usually
one who really appreciates a very creamy
moisturizing lip product but these did
not work for me however on this side of
the palate which could we just give a
little appreciation for having a
separate flap here for the lip
product like yes let's do that
but over here as you guys can see we
have a blush we have a highlight we have
three eyeshadows I really like the eye
shadows I think the eye shadows are
incredibly pigmented and they are
blendable they're dark they're smoky
they're very very pretty I especially
love this shade right here which is
called New York it's kind of like a dark
grey shade with a little bit of like a
silver sheen running through it so I've
been very very happy with that
particular shade and then I also have
been using adorable which is the blush
down here and working that into my
crease they've been playing with this as
well as the cap on be saint and sinner
palette this week if you guys never
check my description box you know that
i've been mixing these two palettes
together and i have been pretty happy so
i love the eye shadows in here the
highlight is just okay it's called pinot
grigio it's just kind of a patchy little
patchy a little more firmly press but
the blush and the eyeshadows are really
really good so that is the subscription
service and like I said not a huge fan
of the lip products of the eyeshadows in
here if you ever find one of these
palettes and it's just eyeshadows I
would recommend picking up I think it's
pretty darn and good all right speaking
of eyeshadow palettes Kat Von D's things
in center has definitely been a favorite
I had one hell of a week trying to get
this review up but I was able to
do an exercise I give same so much
day anyway I had one hell of a week
trying to get this review up I finally
got it up late last night so I'll go
ahead and throw that review up in the
cards for you guys but 20 more different
eyeshadows in here a variety of
different finishes really really enjoy
at this palette I would give it 4 out of
5 stars
like I said I'll go ahead and link at
the review above but that has been
something I've been reaching for quite a
bit up next we have a two-faced
sweet peach creamy peach lip oil right
here so I have three of these I think
I'm going to declutter two of them but
I'm gonna keep this one this one is
pop-it-on peach it's definitely kind of
smells like really really sweet peach
rings or peach candy I really like the
way it looks on the lips I'm not much of
a nude girl you just don't look good on
me I know everybody loves nude lipsticks
or new lip gloss with all that kind of
stuff I'm not really a nude girl I love
like a red lip or a berry lip but I have
to say this looks very pretty on me it's
a very neutral it cares together if
you're doing more of like a smoky eye
look so I do enjoy this it's very very
comfortable it does smell quite
artificially of peaches like I said but
I think it's very comfortable and
beautiful on the lips you do have to
apply throughout the day but it's not
anything extreme so I've been enjoying
that I also have been enjoying my Steel
of smudge to waterproof eyeliner and you
shave damsel I know it kind of weird to
bring up like an eyeliner because it's
such a silly little thing there are so
many good eyeliners on the market but
this is a deep chocolate brown color it
has like a more of a cool tone going on
here and it's just beautiful it stays on
the waterline all day long I forgot how
good these steal a smudge stick liners
are if you didn't know Stila is now
cruelty free they stop selling in China
and distributing there which is awesome
so I would highly recommend you guys
check these out I think they're really
really good quality up next we have the
charts rainforest of the sea aqua
stealer this has been one of my favorite
favorite concealers of life forever no I
know a lot of people say I wish it on to
face and I always on Tarte but hey
listen if they make good products I will
mention that okay I don't hate the
brands I'm just saying there are certain
products from them I don't like but
there are definitely products I do enjoy
from them and this aqua Cielo aqua
sealer is absolutely fantastic so I'm
gonna go ahead and also maybe try out to
the rainforest of the sea foundation I
tried that out when I had more combo
oily skin when I was living in the
Midwest and I did not like it but now
that I'm a little more dry I was
thinking of giving it a second chance so
I think I will do like a first
impressions second-round on that
particular foundation but this is
beautiful very very light on the skin I
hear someone who wants more a light and
airy kind of coverage and you really
want something that's a very luminous on
the skin but this is a great great
product so I really enjoy this a lot and
finally guys do have a mascara here I
know that is kind of more first
impressions wise when it comes to this
guy I have been using for four days in a
row it's all I have on my eyes today I'm
not wearing eyeliner or not wearing eye
shadow just one coat of this it is the
market Jacobs The Velvet noir mascara
now I will talk about this when I do a
my follow up hall for the Sephora
holiday 2017 makeup and skincare sets
that I picked up if this is an
incredible mascara this is like the more
wet version of the Too Faced better than
sex I think I have just found one of my
all-time favorite mascaras of life and I
know that sounds so silly I'm not that
kind of person that loves first
impressions cuz I feel like it's nothing
without a follow-up but four or five
days in a row now using this absolutely
incredible great volume it doesn't flake
throughout the day I really like the
consistency this is the limited edition
packaging for holiday 2017
would highly recommend you guys check
this out so many white guys those are
cocktails and holy grails I will have
another video going up after this in
about an hour so I hope you guys will
enjoy that one as well but I yeah that's
pretty much it
I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
