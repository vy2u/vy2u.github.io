welcome back to my petals and how to
grails where i share with you guys the
products that i have been loving this
week and obsolete products that i have
not been loving so before we get started
if you were curious my hair is just
super super Gracie which is why I
haven't pulled back like this I was
gonna pin up my little bits back my
little one is this called my bits my
little flyaways I was gonna pin them
back but they're just looking really
gross today so this is why my hair looks
like that but anyway let's go ahead and
get into the fails and holy grails they
sale for this week has been is this
combination right here this is the
Revlon Colorstay whipped creme makeup in
the shade 110 pair together with the
Bobby Brown extra SPF 25 tinted
moisturizing balm in the shade alabaster
tint I tried to use this this week as an
actual face primer and I just don't feel
like it peered very well with this it is
a very humectant and very thick
moisturizing balm and I feel like it
it's just so weird because it doesn't
give enough coverage for me to wear it
as my actual base but I feel like it
actually breaks down the coverage of a
heavy duty foundation so it's so so so
overly moisturizing and too greasy on
the skin and I just feel like it really
made a V Revlon Colorstay look very very
sheer on my skin this week so normally i
would say this particular foundation
definitely has medium to full coverage
and this looks like it was like a sheer
foundation on my face this week so i did
not like that i do like this by itself
and i don't i just don't really like
this the reason why I'm I keep reaching
for it honestly is because this is a
product that I am trying to use up in
2016 so that's really the only reason I
feel like this is a very good foundation
on its own but this really kind of made
it kind of very crappy so anyway um
let's go ahead and get into the holy
grass because those were that was the
only technically fail so the first holy
grail is this little guy right here as
you can tell from the thumbnail this is
the trader joes spiced cider it
basically is just I was in the state
applesauce it's apple juice mixed
together with spices and it tastes
amazing I really like it Tom loves this
cold I like to heat it up and it's just
super super good if you do not have a
trader joes in your area I'm sure that
like your local grocery stores has some
sort of cider that you can pick up and
also you can get like little k-cups on
Amazon that are just cider and you can
put ice in if you want it cold but that
has been such a yummy treat and I just
love this time of year the next um Holy
Grail has definitely
then my lorac mega Pro 3 I have had a
lot of fun creating different looks with
this this week like I said in look of
the week yesterday a my favorite way to
use this particular palette is to mix
and match the cool tones with the warm
tones and just kind of go back and forth
I'm creating an eye look I do think it's
beautiful but i will say i feel like
this is a very very basic palette and
you can get a lot of looks out of it but
i do notice that some of the colors like
up here that are very similar to each
other or some of the colors down here
that don't really change that much in
tone i do feel like they can start to
muddle together on the eye but the
actual pigmentation the way that these
blend on the eye and just the
formulation in general is beautiful so
this has definitely been a holy grail
for the week the next Holy Grail has
been this little face scrub here this is
from Garnier this is part of the clean
plus line this is the balancing daily
exfoliator this is specifically for
combination skin it does have grapefruit
and also pomegranate in it so it's a
really nice scrub to use in the morning
it kind of wakes up your senses and it
smells good and I do feel like the
grapefruit really does purify the t-zone
and then the pomegranate is supposed to
soften the dry areas on your face
because if you do have combination skin
you tend to be a little more dry on the
cheek area and I am starting to get dry
so I have been enjoyed this quite a bit
in the morning for washing my face I'd
have really been enjoying this mascara
combo this week the YSL babydoll mascara
combined with my Sephora outrageous curl
mascara these both have like rubber
bristle wands and they just really build
up length and especially volume so the
two of these together have been like a
lifesaver really good enjoy though it's
just love the way my lashes have looked
that sounds so cocky but i need it i
just think they've looked really really
good i also have been loving these two
lipsticks here from a two-faced these
are the la creme lipstick formulations
in the shades a sugar daddy which is a
nice kind of like nudie warm toned color
and normally I don't love like a nude
warm tone color on my lips I I'm wearing
it today I feel like a nude warm nudes
kind of washed me out I do have a strong
cool undertone so they don't look as
good on me but I do feel like this color
is pretty darn good so I have been using
that and then also this particular shade
which is called pink chocolate and pink
chocolate is just a beautiful kind of
like mavi brownish color so there is
pink chocolate so I've been enjoying
both of those I definitely have
enjoying pink chocolate a little more
than sugar daddy but still they are
beautiful very creamy on the lips of
very comfortable to wear I would say
they're very comparable or comparable to
like the bite beauty la creme lip sticks
or not the lip creme lipsticks those are
low prom lipsticks the new a moose Boosh
lipsticks are you moving on I have also
been loving my baby lean instant age
rewind dark circle eraser treatment in
the brightener version if you don't want
to go out and buy like the Urban Decay
color correctors or something like that
I swear to you this does like the same
exact thing it is so good at cancelling
out blue tones underneath the eyes it
also just brightens the skin and as
someone who does pull a very strong cool
undertone I think the pink is very very
nice so I've been enjoying this a lot
this week and I didn't feel like I can
wear that underneath foundation and also
on top of foundation which is awesome
now because that little combo that I
talked about at the beginning was not
working out very well as my base this
week I have been reaching for my
covergirl plus ol a CC cream quite often
and this is something that is in my
current project pan video I started
right there and I am working my way up
it is beautiful i love this product to
death it is what i have on today just
two pumps of it all over my face I feel
like it really camouflages any sort of
redness and a color correct but I also
gives just the perfect amount of
coverage it looks very very natural on
the skin so I've just been absolutely
adoring that i've also been loving this
particular perfume now i do have there
are a few cons with this this is the
nirvana bourbon from elizabeth and james
it smells so good you guys is just such
a wonderful wonderful kind of false
scent it really smells woodsy and a
little bit like vanilla it just smells
so good and i have just been wearing
this by itself usually i do like to pair
two fragrances together like a body mist
and also a perfume because i feel like
that does help it to wear longer and
then that way you save more perfume
because you're pairing it with a body
mist but i do not have anything in my
collection that can really pair with
this very nicely because this is just
such a unique and beautiful woodsy scent
but you guys the where time on this is
not strong at all like I spray it and I
smell it and then it immediately I feel
like it just kind of dissipates so it
does not have a very long wear time and
I don't feel like the fragrance is super
super like thick if that makes sense so
it's not something that you smell
immediately like you have to be very
close to me
to actually smell this on my body so you
do have to use quite a bit of it which
sucks because I feel like I'm already
making a dent in this and I've only had
it for about two and a half weeks but it
is a beautiful fragrance I don't know if
I would repurchase it because like I
said I feel like the scent just
dissipates immediately on me and it's
not very strong but it is really really
nice and we just love the overall sense
so I've been enjoying that I of course
have been enjoying my essence all about
Matt fixing compact powder this has been
a favorite setting powder of mine for
years now it's beautiful it is
completely white I would not recommend
this if you do have like medium or tan
skin tone because this does show up
quite white on the skin but if you are
already super super tasty than it would
work for you it's beautiful I do feel
like it keeps me nice and matte and you
can easily either use it just in your
t-zone or you can set your whole entire
face it's a good product i also have
been loving my wet and wild mega glow
highlighting powder in the shade
precious petals my friends sent this to
me absolutely beautiful rose gold
highlight here it does darken up on my
skin it is not lighter than my skin but
it doesn't mean that your skin can't
glow with this and they have made this
permanent so you could get this on the
wet and wild website so there it is you
see that it literally just makes your
cheeks look wet and I have to say I have
been so incredibly impressed with these
wet and wild highlights that have been
releasing I feel like those are very
good quality i also have been loving
these little nip + fab skin Dragon's
Blood fix cleansing pads these do you
have hyaluronic acid which hydrates the
skin they have cells the like acid which
helps to decongest the pores and ousted
dragon's blood which is some sort of
planned and that's supposed to comfort
and restore hydration to the skin kind
of like um hyaluronic acid but anyway
this is what they look like I got these
at Ulta and they have the most
interesting sent you guys I don't even
know how to describe the Sun and I can't
tell if I love it or hate it i think i
love it i think i love it it's the
weirdest thing if you have these take
away with them and tell me what they
smell like cuz i cannot for the life and
me describe the scent but this is what
the pads look like as you guys can see
I've used about half of them they're a
very very thin soft pad and I have
really been into using pads like this
for toning my face so last week I was
using the first a beauty facial radiance
pads and those are a little more thick
and they do they're a little more
abrasive but these are so soft and
pillowy and they just are so incredibly
saturated with products so if you do
want to use these
like your nighttime treatment or if you
just want to use them like a toner like
I have in the morning first of all you
need to use sunscreen because they do
have salicylic acid but one pad because
they are so saturated will completely
cleanse your whole face which is awesome
so I've been enjoying those quite a lot
I've really been trying to pull out like
my little cleansing pads a little more
because they feel like they've been
sitting around in my collection and
sometimes they do start to dry out so I
recommend storing them upside down
alright the next item or i should say
the next two items i've been loving art
from glam glow these are both mass one
is an overnight mass this is the glam
glow dream duo overnight transforming
treatment this is what it looks like it
is a two-step system one side you have
like a serum and then the other side you
have your seal which kind of seals
everything in one side smells like
bubble gum and the other side smells
like lemon pound cake I like the
combination smells very good I feel like
glam glow products always smell good but
anyway this is an overnight mask it's
beautiful and I like to use overnight
mask I've talked about this before but i
like to use them when i'm just too lazy
to do my skincare at nighttime and
although right now i'm just using like a
two-step skincare system at nighttime i
still feel like sometimes if I just
don't want to like use my peter thomas
roth like unwrinkle pads and then go in
with my sunday riley products because i
will say one thing that i have noticed
mmm sorry guys like a little scratch on
my throat today one thing that i haven't
noticed with these sunday riley products
is that they have to completely sink in
before you can go in with the next one
or they don't work as well so i feel
like it does take about 20 minutes for
me to actually get my skincare on it
nighttime because I like to let um
either my Martian mattifying toners
think in first or I let the lunar oils
thinking before I go home with good
genes and I do feel like it takes a
little longer even if it's just a
two-step system so what I like about
this is that you can go in immediately
with the seal so if you are someone who
just doesn't take your makeup off right
away when you get home and you know it's
twelve o'clock at night and you don't
want to wait for those extra steps
during your skincare routine i love
using an overnight mass so this is a
really good one and then also i have
been loving my glam glow thirsty mad
hydrating treatment this was something i
was considering decluttering to my
friend who has dry skin because i just
haven't been reaching for it i haven't
had the best of luck with this
particular one but right now my skin is
getting drier and i have been in love
with it
and it smells like almond and coconut
and it's just very very hydrating and
beautiful so I've been using that every
night on my skin and then i would say i
used this probably two or three times
this week I do notice you have more of a
difference with hydration and also just
like radiance boost in the skin I
radians busty benefits when you do use
it consecutively or consistently but for
me I just used it like two or three
times when I wasn't in the mood to burn
on skincare at night alright and then
the final item this is the final item
yes the final item that I have been
adoring this week is my elf blush
palette in the shade light this is what
it looks like these are those little
pans that you can actually pop out and
interchange with the bronzer palette or
even the illuminating palette which I
love you do have kind of like a bronzy
shade here a light cool tone pink shade
hear more of a mommy tone and then like
a reddish color this particular shade
the darkest one has been at my favorite
this week I've used this in look of the
week as well I feel like it goes really
nicely with those lip colors that i was
using so there are the lip colors and
then there is the cheek color it has
just the tiniest bit of golden shimmer
in it but I don't feel like it actually
translates onto the cheeks but a
beautiful color really like those for
fall and yeah that is the guys those are
all of my fails in how the Grails I hope
you guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for joining me and I will have my
15 k subscriber giving giveaway going up
