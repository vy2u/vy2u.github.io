welcome back to my channel Oh welcome
back to my Bridals and Hannah BIOS where
I share with you guys the products I
have been loving this week and of course
the products I have not been loving you
know originally I wanted to post my
Tarte toast a review for you guys today
but I'm gonna go ahead and do that
tomorrow I have an early flight this
morning from LA back here to the Phoenix
Arizona area and yeah basically I'm
pretty darn tired I had a gig last night
and I'm just not really feeling doing a
whole review video lately I've been
trying to go ahead and edit clips
together for review videos as well as to
do inserts and stuff like that which
takes a little more time not anything
too time-consuming but just a little
more time and I'm just I'm not feeling
it today I'm really really tired so I
just want to do my typical I wouldn't
take video today but anyway that's
pretty much it let's go ahead and jump
right into it I will happy Tarte toasted
review going up for you guys tomorrow I
want to start with the products though
that work fails for me this week the
first one is from Sunday Riley this is
the blue mood at tranquility cleansing a
bomb if you guys keep up with me on
snapchat I talked a little bit about how
this has just been kind of aggravating
for me it's just not really my favorite
cleansing balm I feel like I kind of
wasted my money when it comes to this
but I'm not gonna return it cuz I can
say it's half gone I don't return
products that are out gone I would never
do that but anyway this is what it looks
like on the inside it now this is
basically a balm for taking off your
makeup so you would take this on to a
dry skin you would rub it all over of
rinse it and then go in with a double
cleanse just to make sure all of your
makeup is properly removed off of your
face now but this actually has
exfoliating beads in it and I wasn't
really expecting that I am someone who's
a little rough with my skin when I apply
my makeup I do it very quickly when I
take my makeup off I do it very quickly
I'm just somebody who does everything
and very quickly and when I do things
quickly I feel like sometimes I'm a
little more abrasive and harsh on my
skin I don't think that this is nice
around the ice in the eye area
especially with those beads in there so
I've been going in with Mike Burt's Bees
cleansing oil around the eye area so
it's just one of those things where it's
like I'm only using it for face makeup
it's extremely extremely expensive and I
got this only two weeks ago and I'm
almost done with it so
this is just not the money in my opinion
I feel like you can use avocado oil
coconut oil anything else or even the
Burt's Bees cleansing oil whatever you
want to use and it's much cheaper and I
feel like it does a better job so yeah
the blue moon tranquility cleansing balm
from Sunday Riley is just not for me I'm
happy I tried it out because I really
have been very curious about this
product but I do not like it
are you moving on guys I do have enough
makeup blur stick now this was recently
sent over to me from milk makeup and I
really don't like this either I thought
I was gonna go ahead and give it a shot
because so many people say it's so good
and it's comparable to the benefit
Porefessional
I don't purchase the benefit
professional anymore because benefit
does test on animals but this is nothing
like that it's this stick form and I
always feel like with milk and makeup
sticks that you have their cooling water
stick it's just not the most hygienic
thing in the world because you're
directly rubbing this on to your face so
if you have acted breakouts or if you
just have you know some skin problems
and things like that it can be a little
problematic over time maybe you want to
go ahead and wipe it off after but then
you're wasting product if this doesn't
really fill my pores all that well I
feel like it just made my skin or rather
dry for someone who does have normal to
dry skin so I didn't like this I didn't
notice a significant increase in
longevity with my makeup throughout the
day and nor did it really blur my pores
that well I would much rather go for my
Smashbox photo finish primer so I did
not like the milk makeup blur stick I
know a lot of people with more combo
oily skin I do enjoy this but I'm gonna
go ahead and declutter this to my friend
all right now let's go ahead and get
into the holy grails for the week the
first two are little pallets right here
so the first one I have is the toilet in
bloom but like I said I will have my
review on the toasted palette going up
for you guys tomorrow I will do
side-by-side swatches of this one and
that one I will insert photos for you
guys so you can see that tomorrow but
and this is what it looks like on the
inside this is one of my favorite
formulas from Tarte I really only like
tea with tarts ice shadow formulas the
rain bars of the Seas the first second
edition and then this guy right here or
the tartlet Edition or formula these are
really really beautiful and I just feel
like a lot of Tarte eyeshadow palettes
aren't that creative quality but I love
this palette and I really am enjoying
the toasted today I just have this shade
right here which is called jetsedder
all over my lid as well as my lower
lashline a habit in my crease this is a
really nice palette for like one
I shadow look so if you want to do that
this is a great palette for that I feel
like they stay on all day they do crease
a little bit on my eyes but I just think
it's beautiful quality smells great and
beautiful beautiful packaging so I've
been very happy with my Tarte letting
bloom I also have been loving my Becca a
play scape a place key glow a place key
glow face palette this is what it looks
like on the inside
you have a selection of you know
highlighters in here as well as they
blush and bronzer I've gotten into this
bond I of bronzer right here it's called
a Bondi bronzed Bondi a few viewers
telling me it's not Bondi its Bondi so
this is bronze Bondi I really actually
been enjoying it it's quite dark for me
but I've been kind of chiseling out my
cheekbones with this I've been loving
the winter berry blush that's what I
have on today it's when I'd be wearing
it every single video this week if
you're curious about my blush and then
today I have opal layered together with
rose quartz as my highlight if you guys
have these in full sizes or this pilot
try layering the two of those together
they're great now a lot of people are
saying this is not the same formula as
their full sizes when I compare the
ingredients they look pretty darn
similar I think what's going on here is
that they're actually pressing these a
little more firmly just because a Becca
shimmering skin perfecter press are very
very well known for shattering and I
think a lot of people would want to take
this for travel so I think the only
thing that's really different here is
that they just press these a little more
firmly but that's what Becca does when
they do their face palettes and honestly
this is good Bobby so I am very very
happy with that up next I do have three
different lipsticks here from a
two-faced these are actually the la
crema lipsticks I recently rediscovered
these in my collection the first one I
have here is pink chocolate now I think
I'm gonna go ahead and declutter this
one it's a beautiful beautiful color
don't get me wrong and I was wearing
this quite a bit this week but I feel
like after a while these like creme
lipsticks start to flatten out quite a
bit and then the little points at the
top isn't as nice and delicate sand I
don't feel like I can really get around
my lip line properly this definitely
starts to go outside my lip line I
already apply of my lipstick pretty
crapoly and I have a flutist so during
the day while I'm practicing and things
like that this just looks worse and
worse so the pink chocolate shade
although the formula is beautiful and I
would recommend these la crema lipsticks
if you like more of a tinted
moisturizing balm but still like a
little bit of pigment there I think you
would enjoy these but this shade right
here I would stay away from however
taffy and sugar daddy I have sugar daddy
on today which is a really nice and
neutral shade kind of like a your lips
but better with a little bit of a mauve
tone running through it this one I am
wearing today I love this shade and I
also really do love the shade at a fee
and tapia is actually a cool tone pink
I'm not really someone who reaches for a
lot of cool tone things shape so it's
interesting for me to like this but I
feel like if you're gonna go for these
la creme lipsticks definitely go for the
lighter shades just because I feel like
they do start to wear throughout the lip
line are outside of the lip line
throughout the day and it's just a nicer
to have lighter shades because it's not
as obvious so anyway really been
enjoying those it looks like I will be
making a cut in this video after all my
sd card just filled up but where was I
okay i talked about the la creme
lipstick so next up we have a two
products here from becca one of them was
sent for PR this guy right here and then
this guy purchases my own money and this
is the Becca under-eye brightening
corrector and this is B a full coverage
concealing crap in the shade praline now
last year I actually declutter this out
of my collection obviously not this one
this was recently set for PR but I had
purchased this about two years ago with
my own money from Ulta and on at my more
combo to oily skin last year this just
slipped all over it slid all over it was
too happy too moisturizing but now that
I have more normal dry skin
I'm loving the formula right here these
are very very similar formulas obviously
the pink one is a little better for
underneath the eyes and then this guy is
just great for spot concealing I do not
like wearing this underneath the eyes
though this particular one because I
feel like paired together with the
corrector it's just too much there so
humectant they're so creamy they're very
very long-lasting but they really you
can feel the product on your skin so if
you're not a fan of heavy products on
the skin you're not going to like these
but I don't mind as long as I'm pairing
it together with a lighter foundation if
I were to pair these together with like
the full coverage a Becca concealing
creme that would be problematic because
that would just feel like I have a
hundred pounds of makeup on my face but
I do enjoy the two of these and I have
been blending them in with this tiny
little micro sponges for elf I recently
picked up the precision a sponge trio
for the second time I do like it
the bigger sponge and the smallest
sponge in the trio aren't that great but
I love this little medium-sized sponge
now I was never a fan of the micro
blender from Beauty Blender I just felt
like it was way too tiny you
have to hold it with like two little
fingers and this is the perfect size and
it's great for blending in those more
thick sort of correctors as well as
concealer so I've been enjoying that
up next we do have two skin care
products the first one is from the
ordinary this is the lactic acid 5% I've
been wearing this every single night on
in my face and I've been carrying it
together with an oil so I will put a
full dropper full of this all over my
face it's really nice before exfoliating
as well as decongestant at the skin I
really do enjoy it and then I go in and
I apply like a marula oil on top but I
make sure that this sinks in immediately
or I mean I make sure it it sinks into
the skin before I apply the oil but I
really do like this is a great product
very very similar to these Sunday Riley
good jeans in my opinion and then during
the day time I have been loving my drunk
elephant sea forma day serum this has
just been my go-to serum you do have to
go ahead and pair this together with a
sunscreen because this has a whole lot
of I believe it's glycolic acid in here
right no I'm sorry it's LM sorbic acid
yeah so it's got vitamin C and all this
kind of stuff in here it's a really
really good day serum it does have
marula oil infused into it so you have a
really nice kind of barrier it's not
like that
typical slimy serum that just sinks in
right away you have to give this a few
minutes but definitely follow up with
some sort of a sunscreen follow up with
the sunscreen every single day after do
your skin care you guys always wear
sunscreen but I really been enjoying
this this is nice for evening out
hyperpigmentation on the skin and so
really good for breakouts so I've been
loving that and finally guys I have two
last products here and they are both for
the eyes the first one is the earth
Decay 24/7 glide-on eye pencil in the
shade muse and then this guy right here
which was the Smashbox x-rated in
mascara I recently purchased a full
sides of this during the Ulta 21 days of
beauty event a character price showed it
in my haul or not but I kind of got it
last minute it's a really really nice
mascara very very wet formula kind of
similar to the Urban Decay perversion it
is a natural bristle one it's super big
so I recommend kind of twirling it as
you go on your lashes but and this is
all I have on my lashes today just one
coat and I
think it's amazing so really good
mascara right here before I break into
the full-size I'm just using up my
little hundred point torque here from
Sephora and then I have the Urban Decay
24/7 glide-on eye pencil in new as you
guys can see I've used a lot of this
it's starting to shorten up quite a bit
but it's a beautiful dark cold tongue
smoky Brown color and it's just nice for
the waterline these used to be my
all-time favorite eyeliners for the
waterline I had I think 20 for like 30
you know what might have been thirty six
of these in my collection at one point I
had every single color of the Urban
Decay 24/7 glide-on eye pencils let me
know if you guys haven't been watching
Mia for the past two years and if you
saw this and like my first makeup what
was it not makeup declutter video my
makeup collection video I think I had 36
of these these are my go-to eyeliners
not all the same color at every single
color from the line but these are just
really really amazing to me however now
I'm really in a 2 in the it cosmetics no
tub waterproof gel liners I know I said
that I was gonna be a little you know
kind of staying away from it cosmetics
because I don't feel like their
foundations especially happy very the
broadest shade selection but if you guys
didn't see it they are coming out with
new shades of foundation I'm very proud
going cosmetics so anyway guys Madison
for my fails in holy grails I hope you
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me on this beautiful sunny
Sunday Saturday it's myth Saturday
afternoon and I guess I'll see you guys
tomorrow for my review swatches in
comparison on the new Tarte toasted
palette 5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
