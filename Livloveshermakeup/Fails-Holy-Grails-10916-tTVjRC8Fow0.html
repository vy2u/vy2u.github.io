welcome back to my vitals and how to
read where I share with you guys
the products that I have been loving
this week and after the products that I
have not been loving so there really is
only one product that I haven't really
been in love with and I don't want to
call it a fail because I feel like it's
between a fail and a Holy Grail mainly
because I'm not quite sure how to use
this I've actually been getting
questions on how do you use this and I
don't really know so this is the Kevin a
quad sensual skin enhancer and this can
technically be a foundation a
highlighting product a concealer
whatever you really want it to be but I
do find this very very difficult to work
with the sheet that I wear is sx20 - and
this is what the outer packaging looks
like and then on the inside you just get
this very very thick product here so if
you do know how to use this you guys not
not a makeup artist or anything like
that so if you do have any sorts of tips
or tricks on how to use this please let
me know down below because if I cannot
get this to work in the next couple of
weeks I am going to go ahead and
declutter it so that was basically if
they failed for the week other than that
everything has been really really good
so let's jump into is the Holy Grails
the first viewer actually sends from
backup Bath &amp;amp; Body Works that was the
same back in body where I stood Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works of this is crisp morning air
and this one is golden autumn day these
are the deep cleansing hand soap
formulation but I think you can find
these in sprays and possibly candle form
so Chris morning air is a blend of soft
pine fresh juniper and juicy pear this
smells amazing if you like those really
really fresh scents during the fall time
like the scent autumn you would
absolutely love this one and then golden
autumn day is a mixture of sunny
mandarin autumn leaves and blonde woods
and this one smells very fresh as well
but it has a little bit of citrus I love
citrus if you guys been watching me for
a while you probably know that so I
highly recommend checking this scent out
if you do love citrus we've had those in
the kitchen the entire week and I have
been over washing my hands like
literally on purpose so I can smell them
which is probably why I have eczema my
wrist currently anyway moving on the
next Holy Grail has been from soap &amp;amp;
Glory and I have a funny story behind
this this is the face soap and clarity
vitamin C facial wash this is very very
high it has like
hi you soo content in it and yuzu is
basically a tropical fruit that has
vitamin C in it so it's kind of like
oranges or clementines or lemons or
whatever and vitamin C is really really
good for brightening the skin it now
with facial facial washes facial washes
with facial washes you know you're only
keeping it on your skin for you know 10
15 20 seconds so you're not gonna get
like a huge like brightening kind of
thing going on here but I still think
it's a really really good decent wash my
only problem is is that the actual
little beads in here are not jojoba
beads so they don't dissolve on the skin
I thought they would but they don't they
are ones that obviously are going to be
discontinued like into 2017 so if you
want to get this particular product just
know that it probably will be gone in
2017 but my funding story behind this is
that I was at Walgreens and it started
pouring rain and I had picked up a
prescription and I was waiting for the
rain to stop before I got in my car and
drove because I'm a nervous driver so
anyway I like was just waiting looking
at the clouds and whatnot watching the
rain like pound down on the building and
I was like okay why don't I just go look
at the makeup aisle or the skincare
aisle so I have been basically avoiding
that entire aisle the whole time I was
there and I walked in and I saw this I
did not know that they sold soap and
glory now at Walgreens which is awesome
so I ended up picking this up and you
guys I bought this for two dollars I had
so many points at Walgreens that I ended
up eating this for two dollars now you
do get 350 ml or eleven point eight
fluid ounces for about $12 for the full
size so it's definitely worth it it's a
gel so it really little goes a long way
but I thought that was funny that I got
that for two dollars Wow
I just talked about that for like three
minutes but anyway that's a really nice
product I've been using it in the
morning to kind of just clear up any
residual skincare from the night before
and I really have been enjoying it
alright the next favorite is from
Maybelline this is the superstay better
skin skin transforming foundation this
does have titanium dioxide sunscreen in
it which is a physical sunblock which I
do prefer for my skin the shape that I
wear is number 10 porcelain and I love
this um I do feel like it goes on a
little streaky if I use it with a brush
it but I feel like it's very very nice
if I do apply it with a damp sponge so
if you have dry skin I would probably
stay away from this just a little bit
because it does tend to cling to dry
patches but if you are a combo or oily
skin I think you would love this alright
moving on it the next
I'm gonna talk about is actually a
supplement Tom got me a double pack of
these these are the the new trawl
advanced sleep melatonin ten milligram
and maximum strength sleeping tablets so
if you guys didn't know I am someone who
burns both ends of the candle so I go to
bed very late and I wake up very early
so it's never good I probably get about
five hours of sleep a night which is not
enough but yeah he recently got me like
a dual pack of these and they're really
good they do have vitamin b6 and calcium
in them as well and then some melatonin
and I believe some magnesium which does
help you to kind of calm down at
nighttime and what they recommend is
taking one of these 20 minutes before
bedtime and I swear to you in 20 minutes
I'm drowsy which is amazing so really
really have been enjoying those I also
have been enjoying my Bobbi Brown Bobbi
to glow shimmer brick palette I love
this this is probably my favorite
highlighting palette that came out this
year for the holiday season
I wear this as the blush I wear this as
a bronzer and then I wear this as my
highlight and I have the blush on today
and the highlight you know technically
depending on what your skin tone is
these these could all work as actual
highlights on you but for the most part
I really do like that they're pigmented
enough to go on as a blush it's what I
have on my cheeks today and I think it's
beautiful just for reference I'm between
an NC 10 and NC 15 when I'm not
self-tanning
I haven't been self-tanning lately so
yeah this is basically at my skin color
it does get lighter and lighter as you
know the winter goes on but I really do
like that this can be a blush and a
bronzer it's so cool I feel like these
are really really beautiful on the skin
I like the formulation and they just
last a long time alright another item I
have been loving will come is no
surprise it is my Kat Von D and metal
matte eyeshadow palette today I have a
really natural look going on the only
two shades that I'm wearing our bone and
also glitz so bone and then the glitch
shape there
I have glitz all over my lid it's a nice
pinky champagne color I just tapped it
on with my finger and then bone is
beautiful if you do have fair skin and
you want to set underneath your eye or
even like your eyelid area really good
color but I've been playing with this
all week I love the color selection I
think it's so beautiful these are very
easy to work with yes you do have to
spend a little extra time blending if
you're gonna do like a really vibrant
pop of color kind of like yesterday
after look of the week I did like a blue
eye shadow look yes technically that
stuff takes longer and you will be you
know doing your May
for about 20 or 30 minutes but today I
put together this whole look in probably
about 10 minutes so really really nice I
love this eyeshadow palette I think it's
beautiful definitely something to look
into and then I also have been adoring
up my bite Beauty match a retractable
lip pencils these are from the 2015
holiday collection but right now they do
have a set out and that is retractable
lip pencils in this particular form in
different colors so these shades that we
have here are kool-aid which is a
beautiful kind of reddish color I bought
this in shop and swatch my stash this
week it goes on so beautifully because
it does have a little bit of a berry
undertone so it's perfect for fall we
also have torte which is that you know
your lips but better sort of rosy shade
it's kind of like a rosy nude it has a
piece of fuzz on it
gross I think I bought this on Friday
and then also we have the shade cafe
which I bought yesterday in look of the
week and this is what cafe looks like
it's a nice nudey kind of color it means
a little more on at the warm tone side
very very beautiful and then today I am
wearing the shade aubergine which is
just a beautiful kind of very purpley
color and you guys know I'm really into
very very comfortable lipsticks and I
love everything from bite Beauty I
recently did pick up their new gloss
that they came out with it's like a
gorgeous gold metallic sort of thing and
I will be doing us a for a haul and show
you guys that products but let me know
down below if you want a review as well
alright moving on I have been loving
this fragrance pairing this week they
are both from Victoria's Secret the
first is the coconut passion Oh -
Twilight spray this is what it looks
like and then also I have been pairing
it together with the pink of warm and
cozy body mist I feel like these two are
made for each other I really like the
scent of vanilla combined with coconut I
feel like it can go either way it's
something you can wear during the summer
time it's something you could wear
during the cooler months it's just a
wonderful pairing and these just smell
so freakin good together so that has
been my fragrance pairing for the week I
also have been pairing together two
mascaras that I really have been liking
today I have on kind of like double
layers I think I have three layers of
mascara on today but I've been period
together at my Lancome Hypnose drama
with my NARS audacious mascara I
definitely need a full size of this
actually need a full size of both of
these they are beautiful they both have
a very wet formulation but I feel like
they define and they also give a lot of
volume so if you were into that you
should definitely check out the two of
those
another supplement that I have been
loving is my ecological formula Mauna
Lauren I don't know if you guys watch
Ellis for living here on YouTube but she
is always talking about Mauna Lauren and
I went ahead and I picked some up and I
had a head calls about four days ago and
I've been popping one of these every
single night before bedtime and it's
almost completely gone
it didn't get super super severe and
horrible I really thought it would and I
was going to be out like this whole
entire weekend but I am feeling
incredibly good so this is a 300
milligram supplement you can take two of
these a day and now this is a derivative
of a Gleek coconut oil so if you are
allergic to coconut oil you cannot use
this but it does have lauric acid in it
which is something that you actually get
from breast milk when you are a child so
it's very very good for you this is
currently the only supplement I am
taking because of my lupus I have been
on this special program where they've
been injecting me with shots every month
and I'm not supposed to be taking
anything else so I'm not taking my hub
nutrition supplements right now or
anything else besides Amano Lauren and
melatonin at nighttime if you guys were
curious all of those like hum
supplements and stuff that I do have
around I don't want them to go bad so
I'm gonna send those to my friend
Rochelle because she's been interested
in kind of like beauty supplements but
yeah those are the two that I've been
taking currently and these are really
really helping me alright moving on I
have also been loving my NYX color
correcting concealer palette I talked
about this in my concealer declutter
yeah and color correcting declutter
video I love this this is probably one
of the best color correctors I have as
you guys can see I've hit pan on quite a
few shades here I love them because
they're very creamy very blendable they
never like adhere to dry patches on my
face I don't feel like they make you
know my fine lines and wrinkles stand
out I think they're beautiful so I
really do like those I also have been
enjoying at my two primers from the balm
I really liked the primers from the balm
cosmetics highly recommend checking
these out I got both of these on
HauteLook for Half Price the first is
they put a lid on it eyelid primer it is
silicone based as is the timebomb face
primer so I really like the both of
these and I have not decoded them so I
will be holding onto those the next item
I have been loving is this model
launcher brows in the shade taupe I got
this in either my boxycharm or glossy
box it's kind of like a dupe for the
Anasazi of Beverly Hills brow definer
so it has that little triangular shape
right there
this actual color comes off a lot more
warm than well now it's not looking form
at all but it comes up a lot more on the
warm tone side than the cool tone side
which is kind of interesting because I
do have actually hair naturally and I
have like an Ashley complexion it's a
little more cool toned but this actually
looks really good in my brows I just
haven't filled in in the front of my
brows today really like the way they've
been looking and it does have a spoolie
on the other end so it's really nice to
kind of comb through but this makes it
insanely like amazing and quick to put
your brows on so I really do like this
product and I would be using that next
week as well first shop and swatch my
stache the next two items I have been
enjoying are these lip balms here so the
first is from pharmacy this is the lip
bloom in the scent or the taste the
flavor strawberry basil I've been using
this during the daytime
I really really like this I need to do a
lip balm declutter you guys I'm really
nervous to let go of lip balms but I
feel like a few of them are starting to
go bad in my collection so maybe I'll
sell that this week but anyway I love
this pharmacy lip bloom very very nice
during the day it does have a little bit
of a sheen to it so it's very pretty on
the lips and it's not sticky or tacky so
I've been wearing that during the
daytime and then at night I've been
loving my creme de Rose lip balm from
Dior I really do love this one let me
show you guys how much I love it because
I have hit some major pan on this baby
and as a flutist I highly recommend
checking this out I use this at
nighttime it rubs off all over my flute
head joins up with a few more Oh flutist
and you do want to get this don't wear
it during the daytime when you are
practicing but it's beautiful at night
I'm very very hydrating it smells like
rose and I just really like it alright
moving on the next item I've been loving
is my Smashbox
I wish sharp waterproof Cole liner in
the shade Raven I have a pretty thick
layer of this on my tight line and also
my waterline today I love the
formulation on these I feel like they
really really define the eyes especially
the shade Raven I feel like they really
define the eyes it really makes them
look nice and sharp even when you're not
wearing a lot of eyeshadow like I said
I'm wearing two eyeshadows today mascara
and then just the eyeliner and I feel
like my eye area looks very sharp and
defined so I really do like these Kohl
eyeliner pencils from Smashbox and they
are our sharp just like the name says
they're always on point
moving on the next item I have been
loving is this amore Pacific moisture
bound rejuvenating eye treatment gel so
I do have a little bit of a complaint
about the amore Pacific line my
complaint is that their products are way
too heavily fragrance way too heavily
fragrance I can smell this eye gel on my
eyes 10 minutes after I've applied it
which i think is ridiculous now the
actual scent is kind of powdery it's not
like a bad scent but it is crazy like
how long you can actually smell this on
your face so if you do have sensitive
skin I would stay away but the amore
Pacific line is really great if you do
have more mature skin or very dry skin
and I even like it for my combo skin
that tends to get a little more dry
during this time of year but it's a
beautiful beautiful kind of gel creme I
wouldn't call it just a gel I would call
it a gel creme been loving this it does
have a little bit of silicone in it I
believe because it's so so smooth and
easy to blend but a really really good
product enjoying that a lot and then I
do have a body butter that I have been
loving oh my god this is the Josie Maran
be comforted
whipped argan oil ultra hydrating body
butter in the scent apple crisp but this
is something that is currently in my
project pan of the video oh the scent on
this you guys if you love the scent tis
the season from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works during
the holidays you would love this it
smells identical identical it just
smells like apple and cinnamon and like
a little bit of cranberry it smells so
good and I love it like I said I've been
over washing my hands because of the
good smelling hand soap that we have in
the kitchen right now and I do get
eczema all over my wrist and this has
been amazing it's super super oily like
I'm not gonna lie super super oily but I
do think it is helpful for those areas
that are super dry on your body so not
something that I would personally put
all over my body I just concentrated on
the really dry parts so it's gonna take
a while for me to get through this but I
really do enjoy that and recently or
yesterday I should say I picked up the
Trader Joe's pumpkin Body Butter so
that's gonna be the one I'm using this
week a very excited for that as well and
then the last item that I have been
loving this week are these facial
radiance pads from first aid beauty
these remind me a lot of the pixie glow
tonic so if you are a fan of those
highly recommend checking these out they
have the pixie clone akin pad form and
also they have them in like cleansing
pad form and also just like in a toner
form if you want to just put it on a
cotton ball
or a cotton pad but these are amazing
they do have a little bit of glycolic
acid in them I have been using them in
the morning instead of my Peter Thomas
Roth unwrinkle peel pads so you do need
to go ahead and follow up with a
sunscreen if you are using these during
the daytime because it will make you Sun
sensitive but these exfoliate tone and
brighten the skin and they are just so
nice the only thing I have to say is
that they are quite textured the actual
pad so what I like to do is apply them
in a circular motion that way I can
really really exfoliate the skin but
these are really wonderful I feel like
they help with breakouts and they do
kind of brighten the skin instantly so
anyway those are all of the items that I
have been loving and not so loving this
week I hope you guys enjoyed this video
thank you so much for joining me and
I'll see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
