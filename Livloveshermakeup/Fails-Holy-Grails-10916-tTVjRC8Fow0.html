welcome back to my vitals and how to Rio
where I share with you guys the products
that I have been loving this week and
after the products that I have not been
loving so there really is only one
product that I haven't really been in
love with and I don't want to call it a
fail because I feel like it's between a
fail and a holy grail mainly because I'm
not quite sure how to use this I've
actually been getting questions on how
do you use this and I don't really know
so this is the Kevin a quad sensual skin
enhancer and this can technically be a
foundation a highlighting product a
concealer whatever you really want it to
be but I do find this very very
difficult to work with the sheet that I
where's sx20 to this is what the outer
packaging looks like and then on the
inside you just get this very very thick
product here so if you do know how to
use this you guys know not a makeup
artist or anything like that so if you
do have any sorts of tips or tricks on
how to use this please let me know down
below because if I cannot get this to
work in the next couple of weeks I am
going to go ahead and declutter it so
that was basically if they fail for the
week other than that everything has been
really really good so let's jump into is
the Holy Grails the first teamer
actually sends from back a bath and body
works okay back in body where I should
bath and body works of this is crisp
morning air and this one is golden
autumn day these are the deep cleansing
hand soap formulation but I think you
can find these in sprays and possibly
candle form so Chris morning air is a
blend of soft pine fresh juniper and
juicy pear this smells amazing if you
like those really really fresh scent
during the fall time like the scent
autumn you would absolutely love this
one and then golden autumn day is a
mixture of sunny Mandarin autumn leaves
and blonde woods and this one smells
very fresh as well but I has a little
bit of citrus I love citrus if you guys
been watching me for a while you
probably know that so highly recommend
checking this sent out if you do love
citrus we've had those in the kitchen
the entire week and I have been over
washing my hands like literally on
purpose so I can smell them which is
probably why I have eczema my wrist
currently anyway moving on the next Holy
Grail has been from soap and glory and I
have a funny story behind this this is
the face soap and clarity vitamin C
facial wash this is very very high it
has like a high view content in it and
you do is basically a tropical fruit
that has
and see in it so it's kind of like
oranges or clementines or lemons or
whatever and vitamin C is really really
good for brightening the skin it now
with facial facial washes faisal washes
with facial wash is you know you're only
keeping it on your skin for you know 10
15 20 seconds so you're not going to get
like a huge like brightening kind of
thing going on here but I still think
it's a really really good decent wash my
only problem is is that the actual
little beads in here are not to hope
abid so they don't dissolve on the skin
I thought they would but they don't they
are ones that obviously are going to be
discontinued like into 2017 so if you
want to get this particular product just
know that it probably will be gone in
2017 but my funny story behind this is
that I was at a Walgreens and it started
pouring rain and I had picked up a
prescription and I was waiting for the
rain to stop before I got in my car and
drove because I'm a nervous driver so
anyway I like was just waiting looking
at the clouds and whatnot watching the
rain like pound down on the building and
I was like okay why don't I just go look
at the nikah pile or the skincare aisle
so I have been basically avoiding that
entire aisle the whole time I was there
and I walked in and I saw this I did not
know that they sold soap &amp;amp; Glory now at
walgreens which is awesome so I ended up
picking this up and you guys I got this
for two dollars I had so many points at
walgreens that I ended up getting this
for two dollars now you do get 350 ml or
11.8 fluid ounces for about twelve
dollars for the full size so it's
definitely worth it it's a gel so it
really little goes a long way but I
thought that was funny that I got that
for two dollars wow I just talked about
that for like three minutes but anyway
that's a really nice product i've been
using it in the morning to kind of just
clear up any residual skincare from the
night before and i really have been
enjoying it alright the next favorite is
from maybelline this is the super-state
better skin skin transforming foundation
this does have titanium dioxide
sunscreen in it which is a physical sun
block which i do prefer for my skin the
shade that I where is number 10
porcelain and I love this um I do feel
like it goes on a little streaky if I
use it with a brush but I feel like it's
very very nice if I do apply it with a
damp sponge so if you have dry skin I
would probably stay away from this just
a little bit because it does tend to
cling to dry patches but if you are a
combo or oily skin I think you would
love this alright moving on is the next
item
about is actually a supplement Tom got
me a double pack of these these are the
the neutral advanced sleep melatonin 10
milligram and maximum strength sleeping
tablets okay so if you guys didn't know
I am someone who burns both ends of the
candle so I go to bed very late and I
wake up very early so it's never good I
probably get about five hours of sleep a
night which is not enough but yeah he
recently got me like a dual pack of
these and they're really good they do
have vitamin b6 and calcium in them as
well and then some melatonin and I've
released some magnesium which does help
you to kind of calm down at nighttime
and what they recommend is taking one of
these 20 minutes before bedtime and I
swear to you in 20 minutes and drowsy
which is amazing so really really have
been enjoying those i also have been
enjoying my Bobby Brown Bobby to glow
shimmer brick pallid I love this this is
probably my favorite highlighting
palette that came out this year for the
holiday season I wear this as the blush
I wear this as a bronzer and then I wear
this as my highlight and I have the
blush on today and the highlight you
know technically depending on what your
skin tone is these could all work as
actual highlights on you but for the
most part I really do like that they're
pigmented enough to go on as the blush
it's what I have on my cheeks today and
I think it's beautiful just for
reference I'm between an NC 10 and NC 15
what I'm not self tanning I haven't been
self tanning lately so yeah this is
basically at my skin color it does get
lighter and lighter as you know the
winter goes on but I really do like that
this can be a blush and a bronzer it's
so cool i feel like these are really
really beautiful on the skin I like the
formulation and they just last a long
time all right another item i have been
loving will come is no surprise it is my
Kat Von D metal matte eyeshadow palette
today I have a really natural look going
on the only two shades that I wearing
our bone and also glitz so bone and then
the glitz shape there I have glitz all
over my lid it's a nice pinky champagne
color I just tapped it on with my finger
and then bone is beautiful if you do
have fair skin and you want to set
underneath your ID or even like your
eyelid area really good color but I've
been playing with this all week I love
the color selection I think it's so
beautiful these are very easy to work
with yes you do have to spend a little
extra time blending if you're going to
do like a really vibrant pop of color
kind of like yesterday after look of the
week I did like a blue eyeshadow look
yes technically that stuff takes longer
and you will be you know doing your make
for what 20 or 30 minutes but today I
put together this whole look in probably
about 10 minutes so really really nice I
love this eyeshadow palette I think it's
beautiful definitely something to look
into and then I also have been adoring
my bite Beauty match retractable lip
pencils these are from the 2015 holiday
collection but right now they do have a
set out that is retractable lip pencils
in this particular form in different
colors so these shades that we have here
are cool a which is a beautiful kind of
reddish color I board this in shop and
swatch my stash this week it goes on so
beautifully because it does have a
little bit of a berry undertone so it's
perfect for fall we also have torte
which is that um you know your lips but
better sort of rosy shade it's kind of
like a rosy new to has piece of fuzz on
it grows I think I bored this on Friday
and then also we have the shade cafe
which I born yesterday in look of the
week and this is what cafe looks like
it's a nice nudey kind of color it means
a little more on the warm tone side very
very beautiful and then today I am
wearing the shade aubergine which is
just a beautiful kind of very purpley
color and you guys know I'm really into
very very comfortable lipsticks and I
love everything from bite beauty I
recently did pick up their new gloss
that they came out with its like a
gorgeous gold metallic sort of thing and
I will be doing us to for a halt and
show you guys that products but let me
know down below if you want to review as
well alright moving on I have been
loving this fragrance pairing this week
they are both for victoria's secret the
first is the coconut passion o de
toilette spray this is what it looks
like and then also I have been pairing
it together with the pink born and cozy
body mist I feel like these two are made
for each other I really like the scent
of vanilla combined with coconut I feel
like it can go either way it's something
you can wear during the summertime is
something you could wear during the
cooler months it's just a wonderful
pairing and these just smells so freakin
good together so that has been my
fragrance pairing for the week i also
have been appearing together two
mascaras that i really have been liking
today i have on kind of like double
layers i think i have three layers on
mascara on today but i've been peering
together at my lancome hypnose drama
with my NARS audacious mascara I
definitely need a full size of this
actually need a full size of both of
these they are beautiful they both have
a very wet formulation but I feel like
they define and they also give a lot of
volume so if you were into that you
should definitely check out the two of
those another supplement
I have been loving is my ecological
formula mana Lauren I don't know if you
guys watch L is for living here on
YouTube but she is always talking about
mana lauren and i went ahead and i
picked them up and i had a head cold
about four days ago and I've been
popping one of these every single night
before bed time and it's almost
completely gone it didn't get super
super severe and horrible I really
thought it would and I was going to be
out like this whole entire weekend but I
am feeling incredibly good so this is a
300 milligram supplement you can take
two of these a day and now this is a
derivative of a gleek coconut oil so if
you are allergic to coconut oil you
cannot use this but it does have lauric
acid in it which is something that you
actually get from breast milk when you
are a child so it's very very good for
you this is currently the only
supplement I am taking because of my
lupus I have been on this special
program where they've been injecting me
with shots every month and I'm not
supposed to be taking anything else so
I'm not taking my hub nutrition
supplements right now or anything else
besides a mono Lauren and melatonin at
nighttime if you guys were curious all
of those like hum supplements and stuff
that I do have around I don't want them
to go bad so I'm gonna send those to my
friend Rochelle because she's been
interested in kind of like beauty
supplements but yeah those are the two
that I've been taking currently and
these are really really helping me
alright moving on I have also been
loving my NYX color correcting concealer
palette I talked about this in my
concealer declutter yeah and color
correcting declutter a video I love this
this is probably one of the best color
correctors I have as you guys can see
I've hit pan on quite a few shades here
I love them because they're very creamy
very blendable they never liked adhere
to dry patches on my face I don't feel
like they make you know my fine lines
and wrinkles stand out I think they're
beautiful so I really do like those i
also have been enjoying at my two
primers from the bomb i really like the
primers from the bomb cosmetics highly
recommend checking these out I got both
of these on hautelook for half price the
first is they put a lid on it eyelid
primer it is silicone based as is the
time bomb face primer so I really like
the both of these and i have not too
cluttered them so i will be holding on
to those the next item i have been
loving is this model launcher browse in
the shade taupe i got this in either my
boxy charm or GlossyBox it's kind of
like a dupe for the Anasazi of Beverly
Hills brow definer so it has that little
triangular shape right there
this actual color comes off a lot more
warm than well now it's not looking for
Matt all but it comes up a lot more on
the warm tone side than the cool tone
side which is kind of interesting
because I do have actually hair
naturally and I have like an Ashley
complexion it's a little more cool toned
but this actually looks really good in
my brows I just have it filled in in the
front of my brows today really like the
way they've been looking and it does
have a spoolie on the other end so it's
really nice to kind of come through but
this makes it insanely like amazing and
quick to put your brows on so I really
do like this product and I would be
using that next week as well first off
and swatch my stash the next two items I
have been enjoying are these lip balms
here so the first is from pharmacy this
is the lip bloom in the scent or the
taste and the flavor strawberry basil
I've been using this during the daytime
I really really like this I need to do a
lip balm declutter you guys I'm really
nervous to let go of lip balms but I
feel like a few of them are starting to
go bad in my collection so maybe I'll
felt that this week but anyway I love
this pharmacy lip bloom very very nice
during the day it does have a little bit
of a sheen to it so it's very pretty on
the lips and it's not sticky or tacky so
I've been wearing that during the
daytime and then at night I have been
loving my crème de rose lip balm from
Dior I really do love this one let me
show you guys how much I love it because
I have hit some major pan on this baby
and as a flutist I highly recommend
checking this out i use this at night
time it rubs off all over my food head
join so if you are a flutist and you do
want to get this don't wear it during
the daytime when you are practicing but
it's beautiful at night i'm very very
hydrating it smells like rose and i just
really like it alright moving on the
next item I've been loving is my
Smashbox I wish sharp waterproof kohl
liner in the shade Raven I have a pretty
thick layer this on my tight line and
out so my waterline today I love the
formulation on these I feel like they
really really define the eyes especially
the shade Raven I feel like they really
define the eyes it really makes them
look nice and sharp even when you're not
wearing a lot of eye shadow like I said
I'm wearing two eye shadows today
mascara and then just the eyeliner and I
feel like my eye area looks very sharp
and defined so I really do like these
kohl eyeliner pencils from Smashbox and
they are always sharp just like the name
says they're always on point
moving on the next item I have been
loving is this amore Pacific moisture
bound rejuvenating I treatment gel so I
do have a little bit of a complaint
about the amore Pacific line my
complaint is that their products are way
too heavily fragrance way to have Li
fragrance I can smell this I gel on my
eyes 10 minutes after I've applied it
which i think is ridiculous now the
actual scent is kind of powdery it's not
like a bad send but it is crazy like how
long you can actually smell this on your
face so if you do have sensitive skin I
would stay away but the amore Pacific
line is really great if you do have more
mature skin or very dry skin and I even
like it for my combo skin that tends to
get a little more dry during this time
of year but it's a beautiful beautiful
kind of gel creme I wouldn't call it
just a gel I would call it a gel creme
been loving this it does have a little
bit of silicone in it I believe because
it's so so smooth and easy to blend but
really really good product enjoying that
a lot and then I do have a body butter
that I have been loving oh my god this
is the josie maran be comforted whipped
argan oil ultra hydrating body butter in
the scent apple crisp but this is
something that is currently in my
project pan of the video oh the scent on
this you guys if you love the scent tis
the season from Bath and Body Works
during the holidays you would love this
it smells identical identical it just
smells like apple and cinnamon and like
a little bit of cranberry it smells so
good and I love it like I said I've been
over washing my hands because of the
good smelling hand soap that we have in
the kitchen right now and I do get
eczema all over my wrist and this has
been amazing it's super super oily like
I'm not gonna lie super super oily but I
do think it is helpful for those areas
that are super dry on your body so not
something that I would personally put
all over my body I just concentrated on
the really dry parts so it's gonna take
a while for me to get through this but I
really do enjoy that and recently or
yesterday i should say i picked up the
trader joe's pumpkin body butter so
that's gonna be the one i'm using this
week a very excited for that as well and
then they last item that i have been
loving this week are these facial
radiance pads from first aid beauty
these remind me a lot of the pixie glow
tonic so if you are a fan of those
highly recommend checking these out they
have the pixi cloten akin pad form and
also they have them in like cleansing
platform and also just like in a toner
form if you want to just put it on a
cotton ball
or a cotton pad but these are amazing
they do have a little bit of glycolic
acid in them I have been using them in
the morning instead of my peter thomas
roth unwrinkled peel pads so you do need
to go ahead and follow up with a
sunscreen if you are using these during
the daytime because it will make you
stun sensitive but these exfoliate tone
and brighten the skin and they are just
so nice the only thing I have to say is
that they are quite textured the actual
pad so what I like to do is apply them
in a circular motion that way really
really exfoliate the skin but these are
really wonderful i feel like they help
with breakouts and they do kind of
brighten the skin instantly so anyway
those are all of the items that i have
been loving and not so loving this week
i hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for joining me and i'll see
you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
