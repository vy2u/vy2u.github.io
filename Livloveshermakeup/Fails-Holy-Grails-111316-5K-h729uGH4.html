welcome back to my finals in town a
grails where I share with you guys the
products I have been loving this week
and of course the products that I have
not been loving now there are no fails
this week so let's go ahead and just
jump right into all the good stuff shall
we the first item that I have been
loving is from sunday riley this is the
good genes all-in-one lactic acid
treatment so this last lupus flare i was
going to safe lupus flare up the blast
lupus flare-up that I dealt with I
actually was left with quite a bit of
hyperpigmentation darkening up my
already there acne scarring things like
that and I really do love this lactic
acid treatment from sunday riley this is
what I've actually been using every
single night instead of alternating
between the UFO oil and also the luna
oil I've just been using this alone and
I really think this is the best product
for lightening up hyperpigmentation from
sunday riley so this has been really
really nice like i said i've just been
left with a little dark spot I'm just
kind of like just acne discoloration it
feels like my acne scarring has just
darkened up I've gotten a little bit of
melasma I never know if these things are
going to be permanent or if they will go
away but right now I just like to think
that they are permanent and I try and
treat them with certain products so I
have been loving this little guy right
here i also have been loving this unani
illuminated milk cleanser this is a very
very gentle cleanser I actually got this
in this month's of glossy box and it is
absolutely beautiful it is very very
performant fragrans which is strange
because it's supposed to be a milk
cleanser which you think would be nice
for those of you who do have dry or
mature skin sensitive skin i would say
way if you do have sensitive skin but
it's a beautiful milky consistency i
have been trying it out with my pareo
mini luna and i will say that should
making me purge like my skin is breaking
out all over the place right now but i'm
pretty sure that that's just a normal
thing because when i first started using
my clarisonic my skin purged for like
two to three weeks so I'm used to it I'm
okay with it but yeah I have been using
that with my little luna for rail mini
and I love it it's very very nice if you
do have more mature skin or dry skin you
would like this because it removes any
residual skincare but it's not going to
strip your face of oil so this has been
a lot of fun to use another skincare
item I have been loving is from paula's
choice this is the resist moisture
newell oil booster for dry or very dry
skin I've been putting two or three
drops of this into my moisturizer in the
morning I've been switching up
moisturizers and I just love this I
think this is a great little product
right here i also have been loving my
two little two-faced eggnog latte and
gingerbread cookie palettes these are
just fantastic i'm so happy with this
little set today i'm wearing gingerbread
cookie all over my eyes and on my cheeks
but this is what the eggnog latte
palette looks like you get six different
eyeshadows with a beautiful beautiful
peach cobbler blush I think these are
nice they're very easy to blend you
don't have to put too much effort into
them they're not like the chocolate bar
palettes but they are probably the best
holiday eyeshadow palettes they came out
with the Christmas in New York
Collection from to face so here is
gingerbread cookie and I foiled winters
dream all over my eyelid today I've been
loving doing that and then I am wearing
the shade gingerbread as my actual blush
or my bronzer so I think these are great
little palettes really have an enjoying
plane with those I have actually been
enjoying using my Becca backlight
priming filter so it is very late I
cannot tell where I am right now because
if i were to smack the product down to
like one line i feel like i'm a little
lower this is going to be in shop my
stash this week as well i'm trying to
use this up by december first I've been
surprised by how much I have been liking
it this week I think it pairs really
nicely with the foundation I've been
using so this has actually been a holy
grail for me this week even though it's
something that I'm kind of getting sick
of and I want to be done with but I do
think it pairs really nicely with the
Anasazi of Beverly Hills stick
foundation these shades that I where is
called porcelain and I think this is
just a fantastic stick foundation
definitely stay away if you do have dry
skin if you have like oily skin or
combination skin I think you would love
this I think you would enjoy stick
foundations in general but they
definitely have a little more texture to
them and they do are they are definitely
a little more dry because it's not
technically a liquid foundation so just
be aware of that before you purchase
this definitely meant for those with
combination to oily skin in my opinion I
have been enjoying this little fragrance
pairing here the pacifica Persian rose
perfume paired together with the care
berry body splash from bath and body
works they smell really good together
they're kind of like a similar kind of
sweet scent the Persian Rose has a
little bit of lemon in it and then this
one is pear and strawberry so those
smell great together really been
enjoying that I also have been loving my
soap &amp;amp; Glory clean on me Clint a crane
clarifying shower gel this is what it
looks like the scent on this is just
absolutely astonishing like I want a
perfume like this I do have like they're
pink body mess which smells kind of
similar but they need to release like a
long wearing perfume in the scent
because I don't even know where to begin
with this then it's like it's musky kind
of smells like a clone but then it
smells like a perfume it is absolutely
beautiful and I've actually been shaving
my legs with this this week so this is
actually really nice it is quite creamy
I don't feel like I get any cuts or
nicks on my legs when I am shading them
so I've been enjoying that a lot i also
have been loving this little mascara duo
right here so i've been pairing by NARS
audacious mascara together with my wet
and wild max volume plus mascara this is
going in the empty bin right after this
video it is now completely used up but
this is a very wet mascara this is a
very dry mascara I really like what it
does for my lashes so sometimes it's fun
to kind of do it wet mascara with the
dry mascara it will give you a lot of
length but also a lot of definitions so
if you do like a little more colombi
lashes I do like that peering together i
also have been enjoying the Catrice
cosmetics prime and find a mattifying
powder this is waterproof this isn't
something that I have been loving but I
do think it's a good product I would
still rather repurchase my essence
cosmetics all about Matt fixing compact
powder over this one if you didn't know
Athens does own Catrice cosmetics and I
just think this powder is better for me
in general but this has still been
something that I have been enjoying this
week so this is a good one I do think
that it is pretty darn waterproof I
noticed that I only start to get really
really oily towards way at the end of
the day like yesterday we went out and i
did not get oily until after i want to
say eight o'clock at night and i put
this on like very early in the morning
so anyway that has been a good product
this week it's not my all-time favorite
but it's still good i have been loving
mixing together my Kat Von D locka
concealer creme in the shade white out
together with my it cosmetics bye-bye
redness neutralizing cream this one's
out like a dream even though it is a
thicker consistency and you would think
that it wouldn't it gives a lot of
coverage but blends beautifully and this
I'm trying to use up in 2016 I'm almost
done it and this is really nice paired
together with this this is too dark for
me and this is obviously too light for
me so the two of them together are my
perfect match really have been enjoying
that I have also been loving my Urban
Decay 24
glide on eye pencils in the shades Roach
and 0 I will say I've been reaching 40
way more than Roch Roch is the brown one
and then zero is that nice kind of shiny
black color I have that on my waterline
today I love the way these we're on my
waterline I do start to get a little bit
of muddiness in like the inner corner of
my eye towards the end of the day for
for the most part these we're incredibly
incredibly well and if you do have very
very oily eyelids or just oily I area in
general I recommend taking a q-tip and
lightly wiping down your waterline area
very lightly try not to irritate your
eye too much but just kind of pick any
sort of like water or I guess tears that
you have on your waterline before going
in with this because then it will go on
really nicely I notice that if my eyes
are really watery I really have to go
back and forth quite a few times to get
this on so highly recommend doing that
if you have very very like watery or
oily eyes I guess you could say but
definitely don't do it if you're
super-sensitive I have been loving my
elf makeup mist and sent with a low
green tea cucumber and vitamins a c and
e for setting in my makeup but also
foiling my eyeshadows like I said I've
been burned this winter's dreamshade a
lot this week and I've been foiling it
to put it on because that technically is
a pressed at glitter so I have been
enjoying this quite a bit um and then I
have been loving my lime crime lip
velveteen unfortunately you guys right
after i did shot my stash on monday i
realized that the other say that i had
picked out for the week which was called
riot had gone bad so these have a very
sweet kind of cupcakes smell to them so
you know when they go bad but this shade
right here which is called salem i have
been enjoying wearing this week I think
I wore it twice and it's beautiful it's
a nice chocolatey brown color and a lot
of you were giving me compliments on
this so I really do like that and then I
have been wearing at this little guy
this is what I exchanged out for the
riot shade this is the NYX mega shine
that lip gloss in the shade of beige
even though it's a pinky color it's what
I have on today very creamy very very
moisturizing actually for a lip gloss
and it actually gives a lot of pigment
so I've been loving that what else have
I been loving i also have been loving
this little tart highlighting palette
right here i feel like i've been loving
this for quite some time now this is
definitely better than the new tarts
highlighting contouring palette that
they release this is the skin twinkle
rainforest of DC lighting pellet and i
love this i have been wearing the shade
moonlights pretty much all week on my
cheekbones and then i do like to take
this shade of sunlight with this one
right here down the bridge of my nose
all my keep this vote and then on my
so really like the glow that I get from
this hopefully you guys can see that on
camera I think it's beautiful the
setting powder in the middle is not my
favorite it's a little too yellow tone
to go underneath my eyes but it still is
quite silky if you kind of gouge off
that top layer which does get a little
bit of hard pan so that is pretty much
everything that I've been loving this
week I hope you guys enjoyed my weekly
favorites thank you so much for joining
me and I will see you guys tomorrow for
shop and swatch my stash it will be an
all drugstore and makeup edition so I'm
very excited are you guys I'll see you
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
