channel welcome back to my piles and how
to Grails where I share with you guys
see products I have been loving this
week and of course see products I have
not been loving let's go ahead and start
with the two fails now the first one
that I have here is the a cosmetic
superhero mascara now I have had a
love-hate relationship with this ever
since I purchased it recently I did go
ahead and put some saline or I'm sorry
some eyedrops in here and the reason why
I did that was because I felt like it
was a really really overly dry formula
it reminded me a lot of lip the Too
Faced better than sex after your leave
it sitting out for a good three months
or so and now after I put the eyedrops
in here it got even gloopy err I mean it
just got horrible okay this really
really started to just take a turn for
the worse if I don't say so myself um
you guys can see as I close up the
packaging here there's literally product
seeping out and this is gonna be
something and I just need to go ahead
and toss because I clearly ruined - the
formula there are some mascaras where
you can like wet them up just a little
bit and things work out well but this
was not one of them I don't really love
it when it's just out of the packaging
normally and I don't really like it when
I add saline or eyedrops in there so I
think for me personally the it cosmetics
superhero is just not the one for me
honestly I feel like this makes my
eyelashes a little too clumpy and that
is saying a lot for someone who loves
 clumpy lashes okay so that is
the first meal for the week of the
second fail is this guy right here and I
really really didn't want this to be a
fail it's the NYX hydro touch primer I
initially really really love this but I
have noticed I've been using this for
three weeks straight now because I
brought it on my trip to Hawaii every
single time I would wear this at night I
would wake up the next morning with
little rashes on my skin I think I am
sensitive to the fragrance level in here
it honestly kind of smells like that
Nivea post-shave men's balm or whatever
it was called a very very strong kind of
cologne like scent and you know what my
skin is just not reacting well to it so
I'm gonna go ahead and finish this up
and then I'm not going to repurchase
it's just not worth it if something is
and you know making your skin look like
trash you know what I mean so though the
NYX hydro touch primer I love everything
about it except for the harsh scent
alright let's go ahead and talk about
two products that I have just been
liking this week they're not anything
that I would repurchase but I also don't
hate them
the first one is from drunk elephant it
is the unbrushed sheer physical daily
defense a broad-spectrum SPF 30
sunscreen and this is a 20% zinc oxide
sunscreen now I did use this when I was
in Hawaii as well so again this is a
product I have been using for about two
to three weeks now and I just really
can't stand the white cast on this now
I'm pretty fair complected okay I only
have one layer of self-tanner on but
this is even incredibly noticeable on my
skin and that's a very normal very
physical sunblock like titanium dioxide
or zinc oxide to have that thick kind of
feeling and so well is that very very
white kind of cast on the skin so I know
that making tinted version of this I
think I'll go ahead and purchase the
full size because this is the first
physical sunblock that I have found and
it really isn't too heavy on the skin I
love a physical sunblock I really don't
do well with chemicals some blocks of
the ingredients in there so I think I'll
go ahead and purchase a full-size of
this in the tinted version it really
does leave a white cast so that's one of
the only reasons I don't like it if I do
mix it together with foundation actually
looks pretty darn good so I will finish
up this little deluxe eyes that's just a
product I've been liking this week and
then also for the light category I have
to put in the key phase TV it's the Too
Faced hangover RX three-in-one
replenishing as setting a spray so this
is just something that I love how it
feels going on to the skin I mean it
really feels good it makes your makeup
look beautiful initially I think I saw
the tail on earth Italia I cannot say
her funky name the Tayla the teyla I
think that's what it is I think I've
seen her talk about how this initially
makes your skin look beautiful and it
will take away any sort of powdery nasur
cakiness that you might have had with
your foundation I have 100% agree it is
silicone free alcohol-free and oil free
but I still prefer the Smashbox
photo-finish setting a primer or setting
spray slash primer there's just
something about this it's not so much
the scent the scent is great it smells
like coconut milk but I honestly have
been using this for probably about two
and a half weeks straight and I'm almost
done with it
I feel like I need a lot of this at
least a good sixth phrase on my face to
set my face in all day so it's just not
worth it for me money-wise I would
continue to purchase these Smashbox one
which Smashbox has recently gone cruelty
free in the past three or four months so
that's
exciting but yeah the two-faced one I
like it but I won't repurchase it now
let's go ahead and get right into the
holy grail shall we I have a little lip
combo here that I have been loving this
week this is actually like a nude lip
combo I'm not a nude girl okay but this
is the park at Princess Amazonian clay
butter lipstick from Tarte I've been
wearing at this appeared together with
the caress lip butter initiated jasmine
or in these scents Jasmine now it
doesn't actually smell like jasmine I
love the scent of jasmine like which it
smells like jasmine but it doesn't but
as you guys can see the tart spark a
princess is a really really nice kind of
sheer formula but it has that peachy
kind of undertone going on there these
match beautifully and when I feel like I
need a little bit a little more moisture
on my lips during the daytime I'll just
go ahead and dab a little bit of this on
top so I really like the crows lip
butters on caress is the cruelty-free
brand I know some people are like oh
they are but yeah they are so if you're
ever interested in looking into their
lip butters I would recommend the
Jasmine one it smells more like honey
than jasmine but it is a very very
pretty color I'm not usually a news kind
of girl but I really do like that one I
also have a little combo here of bronzer
and blush they have just been looking
 fantastic this week in my
opinion this is the ticket to Brazil a
bronzer from a wet and wild it's from
their color icon line this is a funny
bronzer because if I'm too pasty or I'm
too if I'm feeling very very fair you
know what I mean and I don't have any
self-tanner on this looks straight-up
orange on my skin but right now when I'm
kind of in-between with just one layer
of my hem self-tanner on it I feel like
it really looks pretty there's a lot of
shimmer in here but for some reason
paired together with the elf one dollar
blush and flushed it looks amazing you
know when you just put on a bronzer and
a blush combo and the blush is into
shimmery and the bronzer really really
like melds with your skin that's kind of
how I feel about the two of these so I'm
really happy that I picked these out
this week I did kind of shot my stash on
snapchat with you guys kind of chose
these out and they're beautiful together
now the elf one dollar blush in flush is
super super pigmented you have to tap
off your brush in fact I've been going
in and picking it up with my brush and
then dusting it off on the back of my
hand and then going in and putting it on
to my cheeks because it's so pigmented
but also there is a little bit of a
purple hue in here so be very careful
because it can kind of make your skin
look slightly inflamed if you put too
much on so if you've ever had like
really bad rashes before and your skin
turns kind of purple that can happen
with that particular color so just be
aware of that a little goes a very long
way up next I have been loving my tart -
rainforest of the sea skin twinkle
Volume one lighting palette I did try
out the volume - I hated that one but
the original one is really good now I
don't like the setting powder in the
middle and feel like a super super
pointless but if this is the shade
moonlight this one is sunlight if you
want that really really a natural glossy
looking highlight without reaching for
something that's gonna be like wham bam
you know I'm a beacon for a light for
the DM astronauts in space this is a
really really beautiful highlighting
palette they are true powder highlights
I love the way they go onto the skin
would highly recommend you guys check
this out that is the Tarte
it's getting at twinkle lighting a
palette in the volume one version sorry
I just like go to the mirror to check it
was still recording you guys alright
guys moving on we have the two phase of
Born This Way ethereal setting powder
you know what I love this I love this I
know initially when I tried it out in my
try testing out my subscribers favorite
makeup video I talked about how I
probably wouldn't repurchase this but it
looks amazing if you just want to go in
with like a pump of a BB cream or CC
cream or tinted moisturizer so today I'm
I have half a pump of the Urban Decay
one-and-done setting and no
Jesus Christ what does it call one done
hybrid complexion Perfector in the shade
light on and I just put that on it's
kind of like a cream to powder I don't
know if I would repurchase that for my
diet dry skin that one but I did set it
in with this today so I love if you go
in with something very lightly I'm like
this week I've also been reaching for my
armani luminous silk foundation i'm
trying to use that up i've had that in
my collection for a while if i take just
one pump of that and then set it in with
this it looks really good now if i go
ham and i like to use my heart-shaped
tape and i really conceal under my eyes
or i go in and i really really go heavy
with the foundation i'm talking like
really full coverage foundations like
the back of altima coverage complexion
crime or something like that this really
doesn't look that good it just looks
very basic but if you take this with a
fluffy brush and you just kind of buff
it all over your skin not tap it in like
I normally do but kind of Buffett or
just kind of swipe it onto your skin
with a really really light up concealer
as well as foundation it looks fantastic
so I have been loving the Too Faced Born
This Way at the real setting powder
really enjoy that and finally
have some products here from Coastal
Scents now these are recently actually
sent to me for PR the first was actually
a brush a bundle now these are the only
brushes that I've really tried out from
them this week there were a few eye
rushes but I haven't tried all of them
yet so I will keep you guys updated on
those probably on that snapchat if you
guys follow me on there when I kind of
unboxed everything but this is a
foundation brush it comes any brush sets
and this is a powder brush and this is a
chiseled kind of blush brush now I will
say the eye brush does feel a little
flimsy to me in my opinion I know that
Coastal Scents really does those a very
very cheap kind of brush pack so if you
want to pick one up and you want like 15
brushes for like $20 I think it's a deal
but honestly if you can buy them
individually I would definitely check
out their face brushes this guy right
here
applies foundation beautifully it's very
very densely packed but it's super soft
now it's not as soft as the synthetic a
wet and wild brush but what I like about
this is it covers more surface area so
if you're someone who likes to buff in
your foundation quickly in the morning
you would enjoy that and then this guy
right here like I said I've been using
my Too Faced Born This Way setting
powder to pick that up and kind of do a
stroking motions on to my face and then
this guy have been using with the elf
blush now it picks up a lot of product
like I said this is incredibly pigmented
so maybe this is better for bronzer but
I have been enjoying that little pink
asset that they sent over and then also
I haven't enjoyed the revealed matte
palette so if you've been curious about
my eye makeup this week it has been this
eyeshadow palette now when I first got
it and I unboxed it on snapchat I was
like you guys come on like look at all
those both colors on the top really
really do look similar and I'll let you
let me tell ya you know if you have a
very deep complexion I feel like a lot
of these are gonna look a little ashy on
you but if you do have like a sphere to
light complexion or even a medium
complexion and these are really nice
dark colors we're kind of building up on
the eyes I'm not someone who reaches a
very like relatively you know a lot I'm
a somebody who reaches a lot for super
super dark black and brown colors like
these kind of colors down here because I
find that they just go on too pigmented
and then I up and I have to go in
with concealer and cover my eye up so I
actually like that these are buildable
the reason why Coastal Scents actually
sent over PR was because I was recently
talking about their revealed one in two
palettes which I would still recommend
over the revealed matte palette but I
was talking about those in a video
saying that I really do enjoy those eye
those more than the naked palettes those
are products that I bought with my own
money that have made it through of
numerous D clutters in my collection but
I'm happy that they sent this over I
think this is an interesting palette I
have been enjoying it just know there is
a lot of similar color variation going
on here but I've been pairing that
together with my touch of glam Beauty
chroma shadows this week and I've been
I've been enjoying that look so anyway
guys those are my girls and all the
girls for the week I would like to know
down below what products have been
working for you this week what products
have not been working for you love you
know and I guess I'll see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
