happy Sunday I hope you guys are having
a wonderful day so far and this is the
fourth video yes the fourth video that
I'm filming on Thursday I'm doing a
bunch of pre filming for you guys so I'm
sorry if I look a little rundown now but
like I said we're four videos and anyway
welcome back to my channel welcome back
to my brail sinhala trails where i share
with you guys the products I have been
loving this week and of course the
products that I have not been loving so
let's go ahead and start with the fails
there is only one and it is from the
amore Pacific brand this is the future
response age defensive serum this week I
was trying out a 500-point perk from the
amore Pacific line I liked all the other
products that were in the 500 point perk
but I felt like this really weighed down
my skin even though I'm starting to get
a little more dry this time of year I
did not like this whatsoever so this is
not something I would purchase in a
full-size now the other items that came
in the kit that I actually really do
like are the amore Pacific treatment
cleansing foam this is very gentle and
beautiful especially in the morning just
removing like residual skincare and
things like that I also really did enjoy
the age defence creme and this is a
beautiful beautiful consistency really
nice as well if you want to drop in a
few little oil boosters and then this is
my all-time favorite I really want a
full-size of this this is the amore
Pacific treatment enzyme peel so this
actually comes in powder form this is
what it looks like and it comes in
powder form basically you wet your hands
and your face and you massage this in
for about 30 to 45 seconds you can use
it up to three times a week and it is
just beautiful I feel like it kind of
does what my Peter Thomas Roth
unwrinkled peel pads do where it kind of
takes off that gunky layer on the top of
your skin it's just really a nice
products and this is something that I
would purchase any full-size like I said
I do have a mask here or a treatment
that I have been using this week as well
that I really have been enjoying and
this is from Biore this is the freer
porous charcoal pore minimizer so I
don't really notice a difference as far
as like pore size is concerned when I
use this but I do notice that it helps
with breakouts and it does help me to
not be as oily so what you do is you
take one pump of this and you massage it
into your skin kind of let the enzyme
peel you leave it on for about two
minutes and then you rinse it off and
it's beautiful you do want to put this
on when your skin is damp and I think
this would be best if you have more
combo to oily skin if you are more dry
or mature skin I don't think you would
like this but it is a nice treatment
just kind of removing that top layer of
oily residue and gunk enos alright two
items I have been loving from Dior are
the creme de Rose lip balm and outs of
the creme de apricot or creme apricot
fortifying cream for nails these are
both beautiful and this is the creme de
rose
I'm lip balm I have hit a lot of pan on
this BB it is so moisturizing and
gorgeous it has been saving my lips this
week I was gonna say month who is the
week's I've really been enjoying that
and then they fortifying cream for nails
is more like a sell I talked about this
in my follow-up haul on Thursday but it
is really really beautiful and it has
been helping my nails and my nail beds
quite a bit so yes I've been enjoying
that as well alright moving on I have
been loving my elf tone correcting
powder and cool this week and this is
what I've been using to set my whole
entire face in this is one of my
all-time favorite setting powders it is
beautiful you get four different colors
in here and when you mix it together
especially if you do have a really cool
tone complexion this is just beautiful
on the skin I love it the actual
consistency on the pattern up against
awesome see but they actually it's so
finely milled you guys know what I need
it is so finely milled and beautiful and
really just not even visible on the skin
so I really have been enjoying that I
also have been enjoying my wet and wild
cover all primer and also my Maybelline
master prime eyeshadow base and this is
my all-time favorite eyeshadow base if
you are curious I wear the shade of 510
or 515 the lightest version it has a
little bit of a pinky undertone and
released a nice satiny finish it keeps
my eyeshadow on all day without creasing
so I love that and then the coverall
primer from Wet n Wild is really cool it
goes on really sticky and tacky at first
but then it does dry down to a powder
finish beautiful beautiful products
really have been enjoyed matte I also
have been loving my two L'Oreal True
Match super blendable blushes in the
shades rosy outlook and also this one
right here which is called innocent
flush I have rosy outlook on my cheeks
today it is a beautiful nice cool toned
rosy color with silver iridescent
running through it and then this one
which is called innocent flush is more
of a warm toned or neutral toned Kichi
Coralie color and this one has sulphur
iridescent running through it as well
these are very very blendable and creamy
on the skin I highly recommend checking
those out as far as fragrance is
concerned this week I've been loving
my Nirvana and James no Nirvana and Ava
my Elizabeth and James Nirvana bourbon
perfume paired together with my Pacifica
Persian rose perfume I wore this last
week as well I paired it together with
my pure berry body splash from Bath and
Body Works but these two together really
remind me of the bourbon and rose from
the Elizabeth and James line so they
paired together really really nicely
this one has a little more lemon in it
and rose but they really smell good
together so I've been loving those I
also have been loving my L'Oreal
infallible Pro matte foundation you guys
the shade that I wear is 101 classic
ivory this is so beautiful oh definitely
ultimately one of my all-time favorite
ultimately definitely one of my all-time
favorite foundations you guys it's
gorgeous on the skin I feel like it
gives a really nice Demi matte
appearance it's not like a super super
matte on the skin it's like Demi matte
and it's just beautiful I love the
consistency of this I love the feeling
of it on my skin it never looks cakey
it's beautiful you can layer this really
nicely as well and this is a very good
shade match for me it does have a little
more of a pinky undertone speaking of a
pinky undertone I've been loving my
Maybelline instant age rewind dark
circle corrector this is what it looks
like this definitely has a strong pinky
undertone this is my favorite one out of
all of them I do find that the fair
version is just too dark on my skin so I
really love this one beautiful
underneath the eyes there is something
magical about this formulation it really
helps to kind of cancel out blue tones
but also really house with like
under-eye like fine lines and things
like that so I really enjoy that as my
under-eye concealer I have been enjoying
pairing together my covergirl clump
crusher mascara with my L'Oreal
telescopic carbon black mascara these
pair really nicely together
this is definitely more of a base
mascara it has a little more of like a
chunky wand and a little bit more of a
dry formulation here is what the actual
one looks like it kind of looks like the
rollerball lash rate is it called a
roller lash it a roller lash from
benefit and then this one right here
which is the telescopic carbon black has
a very dainty precise wand that really
gives a lot of length so been enjoying
the two of those together I also have
been loving loving loving my Revlon lip
butters in the shades raspberry pi
wasn't a pink mica so out of it already
it's super every pie and also pink
truffle pink truffle is a little more on
the rosy gnudi brownish side and then
this one which is the one I have on my
I've been bringing it all day so you
really can only see the like a little
bit left that is on there but this is a
really nice purpley pink color so I've
been enjoying those I also have been
loving my soft soap body scrub in the
coconut butter version you guys the
smell amazing I've talked about this a
lot oh my god it is a exfoliating body
wash you can get the chocolate version
you can get a strawberry version or you
can get the coconut version highly
recommend checking this out when I
travel to Italy with my mom I've used
this as like my three-in-one product as
my body wash I've used it to shave my
legs I used it to do pretty much
everything it is an absolutely amazing
like product and it smells incredible so
I have been loving that as my body wash
this week and I also I think it's nice
because this time of year people like
your skin starts to get a little more
dry it's nice to have an exfoliating
body wash to kind of remove that top
layer of dead skin I also have been
loving up my covergirl true naked roses
palette this week this has been giving
me just really really nice quick eye
shadow looks in the morning these are
very soft and blendable and creamy and
they are quite powdery that was one
thing that I do have to say they are
quite powdery nude you get a little bit
of Fallout but if you want to throw
something together super quick in the
morning this is a great way to do it I
really like the tones in here the darker
shades do tend to get a little more
smoky on the eyes maybe a little more
cool toned then you would think you look
at them they're a little more ashy I
guess you could say but they are
beautiful on the eyes really really love
this shade right here and this shade
right here so been enjoying that palette
I also have been loving my wet and wild
and mega glow highlighting gold bar in
the shade I believe it's called
Goldilocks I took off and be packaging
so you can't actually see the name I
hate that wet and well does that the
second you take the sticker off the name
is gone but this is what the actual
shade looks like it is beautiful you
guys it is just a true gold color it
goes on so nice and metallo sized and I
am wearing it today and even though I am
fair complected I still feel like this
gives me really nice glowy skin so I
think this is a keeper and the final
item that I have been loving this week
is from Maybelline this is the master
drama by eye studio eyeliner pencil in
midnight master this is really really
creamy and easy to use
I love it I've been just closing my eyes
and doing my tight line at my waterline
at the same time it honestly is
beautiful and the shade is very similar
to Urban Decay's of zero so anyway
those are all of the items that I have
been loving and hating this week I hope
you enjoyed this video thank you so much
for joining me and I'll see you guys
tomorrow
