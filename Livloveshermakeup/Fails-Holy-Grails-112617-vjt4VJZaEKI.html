channel welcome back to my files and how
to grow so we're actually really guys
see products I have been loving this
week and of course see products I have
not been loving this week let's go ahead
and jump right into the fails I actually
have three here so I shocked my stash on
Instagram as well as on snapchat this
past week and I chose that some
different products in my collection that
maybe I hadn't tried or I haven't been
using for a while but one of them was
from Mac and this is the blush in the
shade a sunbath this is what it looks
like and I really said in that video in
the shop my stache video I said you know
I really don't know if I like this
anymore I don't reach for it very often
and I have to say you guys yeah I'm
gonna go ahead and let this go I'm gonna
be decluttering this I just don't need
this in my collection I know my friend
Rochelle would probably really enjoy
this it's her kind of color for blushes
or is it her kind of color I still think
she would like it and this is just a
beautiful burnt kind of crispy color as
you guys can see it has a little bit of
gold and terra cotta colors running
through it but I have to say I don't
find a macca blushes to be anything
special and I actually found that I have
an exact dupe for this in at my
collection and I prefer that product it
is from lorac it is from their unzipped
Kika palette and one of their shades is
just absolutely identical to this now
like I said I'm not a huge fan of the
maca blush it formulas I have gone ahead
and declutter quite a few of them over
the years but the one thing that I will
give that credit for is I love their
shade selections I for their blushes I
feel like they choose that really really
good beautiful intriguing shades but
this guy right here is just gonna go
because I have something better alright
moving on I also have this little guy
here from covergirl this is obviously
again like the Mac product not a cruelty
free product but these were in my
collection before I decided to go
cruelty free if this is called the ink
it's liner in the shade of violet ink I
got this as some sort of a little like
sale product probably about what over a
year ago I had never reached for it and
I tried it this week and I hate
it it is horrible it is so dry I do like
the color it's this pretty kind of
violet color with a little bit of a blue
undertone but this is horrible I can't
even get it onto my goddamn waterline
was probably the worst eyeliner I have
ever used I was gonna use it in my 12
pounds of Christmas project pan video
but I don't even want to use it I just
want to throw it away so
no for that guy right there and then
finally I have this product right here
from a meet a a makeup this is the lick
and lick and keep chin lip and cheek
tint and it is a beautiful kind of
reddish shade and initially when I put
this on I thought it looks really really
a nice I'm scared to swatch it cuz I
feel like it's gonna stay all day the
weird time on this is pretty damn good
because it is a cheek and lip tint but
you guys this is actually very very dry
and it just kind of dries down to this
crumbly feeling on the lips which is
very strange for a lip tint so it's not
my kind of product I'm gonna go ahead
and let it go alright now let's go ahead
and jump into the Holy Grails guys the
first item I have here is the cap on D a
metal matte palette I adore this I know
that they are coming out with apparently
a volume too to this palette as well as
a mini one and I'm not quite sure if
I'll pick up the mini but the volume -
Hallie yeah and this is a beautiful
palette as you guys can see you have the
metal crush formula on top and then on
the bottom you actually have the matte
formula from Kat Von D there blendable
they're beautiful they do take a little
more effort but it's not anything super
super time-consuming in my opinion I
love these especially the metallics on
the top so I've been getting a lot of
use out of that baby up next I have been
loving this pairing right here it is the
wet and wild photo focus foundation
paired together with the wet and wild
photo focus concealer I have it on today
I just drop the concealer but
the shake I'm wearing the concealer is
light ivory and the shade that I wear in
the foundation is porcelain this is way
too light for me so what I like to do is
go ahead and mix it together with my NYX
Pro Foundation and mix her in warmth but
I will take one spatula full of this all
over my face if you have dry skin you
guys a little goes a long way with this
foundation if you overdo it you are
going to get emphasis on pores and dry
texture and stuff like that or just dry
patches on your face so what I recommend
is less is more with this foundation if
you do have dry skin but it has an
incredibly long aware time I hate the
scent of it it smells like
but you know besides that it has a great
wear time I feel like it's a really
really good at reasonably priced
foundation so I have been enjoying a
couple of products from the wet and wild
photo focus line up next I have the elf
hydrating water essence right here I've
been getting back into this this week
it's just a beautiful product
I love essences and this is just
something I have been using probably for
the past three and a half weeks straight
I didn't mention it last week's fail
some holy girls I forgot to so I thought
I would today it's beautiful it's
basically
wait liquid kind of lotion what I'd like
to use this for is going in after I use
a my toner especially if I strip my skin
a little too much of this we'll just go
ahead and put that moisture barrier back
on to my skin before going in with my
serum and I like to take a little bit in
my hands I rub it together I press it
upwards into my neck as well as all over
my face even underneath my eyes I get no
irritation from this and it gives a
really really nice solid layer of
moisture before going in with the serum
next I do have my contour palette as
well as my highlighting palette that
I've been loving this week and this is
her IV Y Beauty it's the highlight and
contour palette and I think this in a
boxycharm months ago before I went
cruelty free it really is gorgeous I had
never cracked into it before which is
why when I was shopping my stash I was
like I should kind of check that guy out
you have a highlight number one
highlight number to highlight number
three highlight number one and highlight
number two are perfect for setting the
under-eye area and then I've really been
reaching for contour number one and
contour number two it shows a lot my
cheekbones this week it's a really
really good product but these are very
pigmented so you have to be quite
careful and then up next like I've been
loving my sweets blow kid from Anasazi
of Beverly Hills this has been hiding
somewhere in my collection because I
have not been able to find it for a
while but I have to say it my all-time
favorite shade in here currently this
week has definitely been a sassy grape
usually when I'm super fair complected
it is marshmallow because that's the
only true highlighting shade for me
these are eyes safe so you can go ahead
and put them on your eyes a butterscotch
does have a little bit of glitter flecks
in there so just be careful around your
eye area but sassy grape is amazing now
that I have a little more of a tan I
love it on my skin I'm wearing it today
I think it's beautiful it gives off this
beautiful silvery pink kind of
iridescent with a little bit of purple
mixed in there as well I'm just I'm
really into this shade right now so that
is the honest doffy of Beverly Hills
sweets glow kit and then I can actually
have a product here that was actually
sent to me for PR from Dermalogica and
this is called the clear start breakup
clearing all over toner and now
originally I thought this was for the
face and I kind of just started using it
on my face and I didn't think it was
anything as spectacular but then I
realized a breakout clearing all over
toner you can use this anywhere on your
body if you guys follow me on snapchat
you know that I'm constantly talking
about how bad the pimples are on the
back of my goddamn back I don't know
what it is but I just have these big
painful sets on the back of my back
and I also get them on my neck as well
as my chest area I have been using this
and I don't see a significant difference
but I do notice a little bit of a
difference I've been using it for eight
days straight and what I do is I spray
it on to my chest my neck and my back
after I get out of the shower when my
hairs like up in a towel and I have been
enjoying it I believe it does have some
witch hazel in here maybe a little bit
of tea tree oil because I can definitely
smell those two ingredients but overall
this is pretty good I feel like I'm
gonna need to go to the dermatologist
and get some sort of a supplement or
something that's gonna help to clear
everything up at the end of the day just
because that's really really bad on my
back but this is pretty darn good and
using it for eight days straight and I
do notice a difference and then finally
guys I have your product here from
Charlotte Tilbury this is the cheek to
cheek swish and pop blusher in first
love this was sent to me for a PR
probably about eight months ago I call
it the boob blush because it looks like
a nipple and a boob I don't know why I
just I'm such a child anyway this is a
gorgeous color so I wanted to use that
one with the maxim bath this week and
this was definitely the one I was
reaching for the most often it may look
a little mundane as far as the color is
concerned because that outer part is a
little more of like a topi kind of
greyish color but it does have a little
bit of Sheen to it and the peachy
interior is just really really nice when
you look at the two of these
side-by-side you would think you would
want to reach for this guy but you know
what no I was reaching for this baby all
week it's easier to blend in the Mac
blush it goes on beautifully and it does
stay all day so anyway guys those are my
girls and pull the girls for the week I
hope you enjoyed this video thank you so
much for joining me and I'll see you
guys tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
