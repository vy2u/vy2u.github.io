my channel and welcome back to my
battles and had a great over I share
with you guys new products I have been
loving this week and of course the
products I have not been loving let's go
ahead and start this off with the fail
there is only one for the week I haven't
been wearing a ton of makeup this week
the past couple of days I've been
wearing a little more eye shadow and
stuff like that but for the most part
and this whole entire week I've been
doing a little more of it defined brow
with a bold lip as well as pretty
minimal eye makeup like literally just
mascara and some white eyeliner on my
waterline but I have to say this NYX
eyebrow pencil in the shade at taupe is
incredibly deceiving so I picked this up
on Tuesday I did haul it and I've been
wearing it in a couple of my videos I
can already tell this is not the product
for me no I do like the applicator and
the little brush here is really not that
bad either I feel like it really helps
to push up the little brow hairs over on
the outside of my brow but overall this
is just incredibly incredibly warm toned
I actually have it paired together in my
brows today with the Anasazi of Beverly
Hills brow pencil in the shade blonde
and that one is even more topi or cool
toned then this is now lately I have
been using a Nevada conditioner to kind
of like darken up in my hair color
because I can't color it right now
because of the scarring on the back of
my scalp and you know it's giving me a
little more of like a chocolatey vibe to
my hair however this guy right here you
know my eyebrows I do not die and I do
not put any tinted conditioner in so
they're still pretty naturally actually
blonde and this is just way way way too
warm tone so that is definitely the feel
for the week and the NYX eyebrow pencil
in the shade at taupe all right moving
on guys I have two foundations here from
Burt's Bees that I have been loving this
week again this guy picked up on Tuesday
I am wearing it today I have two pumps
of it all over my face it is the
goodness glows liquid makeup in the
shade that I wear is one zero one zero
ivory which is the second to legacy aid
I could probably use a step down from
this guy right here and I'm not even
self tanned right now I have a little
bit of self tanner on but not too much
so I think I need a little bit of a
darker shade this does not oxidize
throughout the day which is really nice
if you do have incredibly pale skin and
you're looking upright cruelty free
foundation from the drugstore this is
nice now if you do have oily skin or
combination skin I cannot see you liking
this I only
gets on my driest dry as the days where
I'm having like dry patches I notice if
I use too much of this foundation I do
get weird separation throughout the day
and I don't know if that has to do with
the really really natural ingredients
list or not but I will say that this is
just one of those products that for me
it looks beautiful on my skin but only
if I use one to two pumps now the Burt's
Bees BB cream with noni extract I
absolutely love this I've been wearing
this all over my face today and I don't
use concealer when I go in with this
it's not really a BB cream it's more of
a CC cream it's got that greyish kind of
tone to it this is a really nice a dupe
for the dr. jart BB cream in my opinion
so if you love that and you're looking
for a cruelty-free alternative from the
drugstore and this is great it has SPF
15 and I do wear these shade light so
yeah I've been enjoying the two of those
this week and the next item that I have
been really loving is my Becca afterglow
palette my friend Meg recently sent this
to me she was not getting a lot of use
out of hers and we are YouTube friends
so I trust her with kind of like lately
used makeup she said that she barely
ever used this and I have been using it
like crazy so I'm so happy to have it in
my life the shades that you have in here
are wild honey mineral blush as well as
flower child which is one of my
favorites
you also have taupe has shimmering skin
perfecter press as well as rose gold and
moonstone I rose gold and moonstone
mixed together on my cheekbones down the
bridge of my nose today and I am wearing
flower child as my blush this is a great
little palette I wish they would bring
this back because I always regretted not
picking it up but now that I do have it
I'm very very happy it's super travel
friendly and sleek as well alright guys
I do have a couple of lip products I
have been a rocking this week I have
been loving a purple lip and how I've
been getting that really really juicy
glossy purple lip is by using the NYX
intense of butter gloss in the shade it
very strudel I got this in the mix lippy
advent calendar and it's just so
cool I mean it's incredibly pigmented as
you can see but it makes your lips look
super super juicy if you are someone who
has very very perpetually dry lips like
I do I think you would enjoy this a lot
or just the NYX intense butter gloss
formula in general and then I have also
been loving my Charlotte Tilbury the
queen lipstick this is technically a
matte lipstick but I feel like it's more
satiny it's just the perfect like a
bright fuchsia with a little bit of
maybe like a purple running through it
so that it's not overly bright it makes
my teeth look really really nice
white and when you do pair it together
with really really minimal makeup and
say you do just mascara and white
eyeliner and then you put this on the
lips it looks really really cool so I've
been loving those two lip products right
there I also have been loving my it
cosmetics hello lashes mascara I got
this one it was on sale for $10 at Ulta
and it was just such a great deal I like
this for the days where I want a minimal
kind of looking lashes where I don't
want them too clumpy I do like the
little ball at the end here I know I
talked about the wet and wild last
renegade and how like that constantly
poked me in the eye this is the perfect
size and I really give me chuffing on my
own saliva this is the perfect size and
I really do like it the rubber bristle
one as well here and I just feel like I
can get into all my lower lashes without
poking my eye I could use the little
ball tip as well and then it really does
give me a nice amount of length so it's
not a trifecta mascara I do prefer the
lacs renegade but I still really enjoy
this especially when I am wearing a
minimal make-up or what I'm having
minimal makeup days and finally guys I
have two different skin care products
here one is from skin diva and the other
one is from the ordinary these brands
really kind of remind me of each other
the Ordinaries grande active retinoid 2%
emulsion I recently picked up from
Sephora love this this is great
if you are very very sensitive to
retinols or retinoids in general and you
notice that you get a lot of breakouts
or a lot of dryness from using them I
would highly recommend you look into
this it has a lot of ingredients that
help to bind it together so that it does
not irritate is the skin and it is a
fraction of the cost of the Sunday Riley
luna sleeping night oil the luna
sleeping night oil definitely gives me a
little more moisture but I really do
like this I've been using one pump every
single night I don't use it around my
lip area so I avoid this kind of area
right here and I do avoid my eye area
but everywhere else it's really really
nice and then during the daytime I have
been using these skin diba vitamin b5
serum with hyaluronic acid now this was
recently sent to me for PR I have to
write out quite a few products from skin
diva and they're one of those brands
that's super super popular on Instagram
but I feel like they kind of get a bad
rap because they actually have really
good products for a really really nice
price like I said they're pretty similar
in price to the ordinary and the
products that they have like they're
freulich acid serum as well as their
what is that Matrixyl 3000 serum I
really like all of that now
only problem with mio is hyaluronic acid
right now you know if he didn't know
hyaluronic acid pulls moisture from the
air into your skin I'm living in the
desert especially during the wintertime
there's not a lot of moist air or
humidity hanging around here but I still
do notice that the vitamin b5 gives a
nice amount of hydration to my skin so
I've been enjoying that as well so
anyway guys that is it pretty short and
quick little fails and holy grails here
I hope you had a wonderful weekend and I
guess I will see you guys tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
