my channel welcome back to my files and
how the Greco's where I share with you
guys the products I have been loving
this week and of course the products I
have not been loving now actually we are
going through at my weekly favorites for
the past two weeks and yes there are
only favorites I really haven't tried
anything out - the past two weeks that I
have been horribly horribly disappointed
with so if you're interested in seen of
the products that I have been loving
then please keep on watching so the
first one I want to start with is from
Becca this is one of their lush
lip color balms this particular shade is
called home into place so now it is the
one I have on today and this is
basically like a my lips but better sort
of color but I have a little more of
like a pinky hue to it it's quite
pigmented it's a glossy it's comfortable
it tastes good and this has just been my
go-to lip product for the past two weeks
so the first so holding around for the
week is the Becca a lush lip color balm
in strawberry slices alright up next I
do you have two body mists here I've
been really into body mists which
normally I'm not I like a strong perfume
but throughout the day while I'm at work
I like to go ahead and take a body mists
with me pack it in my purse and then
spritz throughout the day so I can kind
of continue the scent of my perfume if
that makes sense so it doesn't die down
and I don't have to reapply because
let's be honest a perfumes are very
expensive and if you'd use as much as I
do I feel like you go through them
pretty quickly so the first body mist I
have been loving is from hemp so my
friend Rochelle recently sent this to me
it is the go she orange lemonade citrus
twisted hydrating herbal a body mist and
the second one is the body shop Satsuma
body mist now this one smells like
lemonade and a little bit of like berry
and this one right here smells like
straight-up citrus would highly
recommend both of these and this one is
vegan
this one is cruelty free they are both
absolutely fantastic I love the scent on
them and of course as always a must-have
now base
I have to go ahead mmm spray it alright
guys moving on I have a my favorite
foundation for the past few weeks that
this is the Josie Maran vibrancy
foundation fluid I currently wear the
shade at dynamic which is way too light
for me so I have been mixing it with my
NYX Pro Foundation mixer in the shade
warms aka pfm o 6 and this is basically
the product that I've been using to
darken up my foundation so that I don't
have to exchange shades or I don't have
to actually like toss away the shades
that don't fit me this works really
really well so I
the Josie Maran vibrancy foundation
fluid I've been talking about it for
years ever since it came out so I feel
like apps not coming out of my nose I've
been talking about ever since it came
out it's absolutely fantastic it gives a
really nice amount of coverage you can
do half a pump and get kind of like
sheer medium coverage very very natural
and skin like or you could do with three
pumps and you can get full coverage it
still remains pretty glossy on the skin
so you do have more complex wiggly skin
I would definitely recommend going ahead
and setting in and with a face powder
but this has definitely been a favorite
I love this a bit alright moving on I
have two skin care products here the
first one is from Pacifica and it's
leaking you know this is the seafoam
complete face of wash it removes makeup
cleanses and tones the skin I have been
using this as a double cleanse I did
pick this up and Target recently I had
my eye on it for a while
this is 100% vegan as well as
cruelty-free it smells amazing if you've
ever tried the underarm deodorant wipes
from Pacifica which I'm obsessed with
they smell like coconut milk like very
very strongly of coconut but like a
sweet coat now I was like a coconut
cupcake you know what I mean I love it
and this smells exactly like that so if
you're thinking Oh cruelty-free and
vegan it probably doesn't smell good it
probably doesn't have a good consistency
you are wrong it smells amazing
and it does have this nice jelly boyens
kind of consistency to it now I don't
feel like it really removes a lot of
gunk and debris from my skin so I use it
as a double cleanse um but yeah I think
this is around ten dollars at Target
when I highly recommend you guys go
ahead and check it out and they have a
bunch of different cleansers that are
new to choose from so really enjoy that
another item here from target is the
pixie glow tonic I'm sure you guys have
heard of this this is such a great toner
it is a five percent glycolic acid
exfoliating toner and it's just
absolutely fantastic it's got this nice
interesting sort of lemongrass and
plastic sort of scent I don't even know
how to describe used to hate this time
and the more I use it the more I love it
it's got a nice interesting fragrance
there you go it's strong its
in-your-face it's a little pungent and
if you hate it you're gonna hate it but
I do feel like the scent dissipates once
you put it on a cotton pad and then put
it on your face I've been using this in
the morning as well as the night I just
make sure not to follow up with any sort
of retinols or Ajay's or anything like
that
we love mixed together with this and
basically they contract each other so
you don't want to do that if you do want
to use this I would recommend just using
it with a regular CRM something that
doesn't have a J's or retinol in it and
then at night time go ahead and just
follow up with an oil or some sort of
moisturizer but it's beautiful so great
for so many different kinds of skin
types I feel like if you're combo oily
you're gonna love this because it really
takes care of oil as well as the
breakouts even if you have dry skin kind
of like me it's great because by colic
acid exfoliates so what highly recommend
this lovely pixie glow tonic up next I
have my Tarte de leche toasted palette
as well as my tart let in bloom palettes
I've been playing with these for two
weeks now I just absolutely am in love
with the formula on the new toasted
palette if you would like to see my
review on this I'll go ahead and throw
it up in the cards but it's gorgeous
they're very soft very buttery very
creamy and smooth the Matteson here are
and then the shimmers I really do love
reaching for my tartlet in bloom and the
shimmers in the toasted palette are
pressed a little more firmly but I'd
still like to mix the two of these
together and this one right here which
is the in bloom obviously has more cool
tone shades in here which I am more
drawn to you but lately I've been loving
kind of like a warmer I look because of
the toasted palette so really have been
enjoying those too
okay up next like do you have my Anasazi
of Beverly Hills a blush kit in radiant
- this has been my go-to for the past
two weeks I very very rarely I've been
pulling in a different blush today I do
have a different blush on but seriously
for the past two weeks this is all I've
really been reaching for there are two
shades in here that are a little more
cool tone and then two there are a
little more warm tone they layer
together beautifully none of them are
matte so if you do like a very matte
blush you're not going to like these but
they look gorgeous on the skin they're
silky they're finally melt they're
buttery and easy to blend so I've been
loving that and then finally guys I have
two highlighting palettes here that I've
been reaching for a lot - one is from
the drugstore and one is high-end and
this is the Wet n Wild mega glow
highlighting palette I did a review and
swatches on this so I'll also go ahead
and throw it up in the cards if you're
interested I don't love every single
shade in here and I do find that these
are maybe a little more glittery than
their full-size highlighters that they
sell from the mega Glo collection so I'm
not a huge fan of this highlighter but I
do love the three right here they're
very very beautiful very wham-bam in
your face and very very similar as far
as like blinding
lights are concerned to the honest
Athiya beverly nose blow kids they may
not have the same texture and they may
not really go on to the skin the same
but you get that blinding blinding sort
of look this guy right here is the
Anastacio beverly hills sugar glow kid
and i have to say i feel like i'm
preferring my wedding wild over there
sugar glow kit the sugar glow kid tends
to have a little more like mundane
colors in it I'm not obsessed with every
single one in there but then again I'm
not obsessed with every single shade in
the wet and wild so it's just been fun
kind of layering these together playing
with different kind of shades and I feel
like if you really want to experience a
good highlighting palette but you don't
want to pay $40 this is a great option
so anyway guys those are my weekly
favorites for the past two weeks I hope
you enjoyed this video thank you so much
for joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
