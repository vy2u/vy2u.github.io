my channel and welcome back to my pals
and how to grails where i share with you
guys the products that i have been
loving this week and of course the
products that i have not been loving so
let's go ahead and jump right into it we
are going to start with the sale for the
week so that we can end things on a
happy note the only fail for the week is
this little mini brush set right here
from Charlotte Tilbury so recently
Charlotte Tilbury did reach out to me
and send me some products in exchange
for an honest review on my channel and I
have to say I pretty much love
everything that they sent me but this
right here it wasn't like a no no a
no-go so this is what the actual
packaging looks like I love the
packaging it's just a little mini clutch
kind of like the size of my hand if you
open it up and you do get four different
brushes in here so again the packaging
on the inside is adorable but it's not
always about the packaging right guys so
it's about the brushes and I feel like
two of them are just okay you do have
these two little mini smudger brushes
right here which are pretty good but
then this guy right here which is a
blending brush and also the blush brush
I just feel like they are very scratchy
on my face Charlotte Tilbury is
definitely a little more on the pricey
side so I feel like if you're gonna buy
their products you should buy something
that's going to be worth your money and
I just don't feel like this mini brush
set is now I have never tried they're
full sized brushes so I don't know if
those are any different but yeah would
not recommend that alright let's go
ahead and get into the Holy Grail so the
first one is from Marc Jacobs this is
the genius gel supercharge foundation
shade that I wear is ten ivory light I
have been loving this this week first of
all I feel like this is aesthetic goals
I love the way that this packaging looks
it's just so sleek and beautiful in this
particular shade matches me really well
right now I thought for some reason it
was gonna be a little light but it
actually does darken up and oxidize
about half shaded down so I do really
like it I think it's beautiful
if you do tend to have more like dry or
combination skin where you are a little
more dry this time of year I think you
would like this a lot it kind of goes on
with the coverage of a water foundation
so anything from sheer to light coverage
but it's beautiful overall really really
do enjoy it and it builds nicely on top
of itself so you can build a few layers
alright the next item that I have been
loving is from the freemen a feeling
beautiful line this is the golden green
brightening mask this is a meant for a
dry skin earlier in the week I was
definitely having more dry skin but it's
starting to get a little more oily and
combination and congested
the end of the week because it is that
time of the month at TMI I know anyway
this is supposed to hydrate and brighten
the skin you do get six fluid ounces a
product in here for like five dollars on
the ulta.com website it's really really
good it's just a nice thick kind of
jelly let me show you guys the
consistency it's a really thick kind of
jelly it reminds me a lot of the Peter
Thomas Roth Roe stem cell bio repair gel
mask I just put a huge thick layer on my
face and I feel like even though it
doesn't brighten like crazy it
definitely does hydrate my face so if I
need a little boost of hydration I just
put that on leave it on for about five
minutes and then rinse it off and I'm
good to go
all right the next item that I have been
loving is from Too Faced this is the
chocolate bonbons palette now although I
have been a little disappointed in
two-face lately with some of the items
that they have released I have to say
their chocolate bar palette um the first
one the second one and this one are just
such a good quality I love their 9 pan
palettes to face still remains to be my
favorite high-end brand I've just been a
little disappointed with some of their
newer releases lately but if this is
what the chocolate bonbons palette looks
like on the inside
today I'm wearing the shade mocha in my
crease and then I have satin sheets all
over my lid and I just really liked the
way it turned out I do like more cool
toned shadows so I feel like you'd get a
nice a mixture of those in here and also
I really do enjoy some of the pink
colors in here like totally fetchin also
cotton candy and of course the shade is
sprinkles so those are a few of the
colors let me show you guys some
swatches it's just a beautiful palette
overall and I would recommend going
ahead and picking it up so there are a
few swatches for you guys the next item
that I have been loving is from the
Pacifica brand which I really love their
brand this is the kale water micellar
cleansing toning so this is kind of like
half toner half micellar cleansing water
it does have glycolic acid in here which
is really good for oily and blemish
prone skin so I have been enjoying this
like I said I've been breaking out a
little market EMI at that time of the
month so this has been really really
good I am thinking of doing a compare or
beware on this versus the pixi by petra
skin treats what's it called a glow
tonic I feel like they are very very
similar but you get way more product in
here so definitely let me know if you
want to see that video but yeah I have
been enjoying that a lot this week I
also have been enjoying the Charlotte
Tilbury scent of a dream perfume like I
said they
sent me some of their products and this
was one of them that I really ended up
liking so I love the bottle first of all
I'm a huge fan of perfume I have a
really large perfume collection I will
go ahead and link my video down below if
you would like to check it out but this
smells really really unique I've only
been wearing this by itself this week I
haven't been layering it with any sort
of body mist it smells kind of spicy and
sophisticated which normally is not my
kind of scent I am all about like those
fruity kind of bubbly more I don't know
just like sweeter kind of sense but for
some reason I really do like this I feel
like a woman when I'm wearing this I
don't know it's just really really a
nice scent so I have been enjoying that
I do wish that the wear time was a
little longer I feel like it starts to
wear off in about 3 to 4 hours so you do
have to reapply but still really good
product I also have been loving my
maybelline superstay better skin at skin
transforming powder in the shade and
number 10 at porcelain this is a little
dark for me right now but I have hit pan
on this and I just really enjoyed this
powder it is very very finely milled and
I have been layering this together with
the by Terry hyaluronic hydra powder
this week so this was also sent to me in
exchange for an honest review from octa
Lee and a by Terry and I just think it's
fabulous you guys now I am somebody who
is a huge fan of the buy buy pours
translucent powder as a finishing powder
this is from a cosmetics if you are
curious I have to say the by Terry is
even better um it just looks beautiful
on the skin I feel like if you do have
combination or oily skin you can go
ahead and set your face in like I did
with the Maybelline powder and then go
ahead and either like buff this into the
buffing technique or you can go ahead
and just stipple this onto your face as
your finishing powder and even if you're
breaking out even if you're having
texture it will make your skin look nice
and smooth so I really do like this it
never makes my skin look dry it is
something that I am definitely going to
be purchasing with my own money it is
very very good alright I also have been
loving the pixie makeup fixing mist this
does have rosewater and green tea in it
this is one of my all-time favorite
setting sprays you guys I just think
it's so nice you definitely can foil
your eyeshadows with this you also can
use it as a primer water kind of like
the smashbox one and i just feel like it
comes out in a really really nice mist i
don't know if you guys can see that
sometimes the nozzle does get clogged so
just run it underneath hot water but for
the most part this is really really good
and it smells amazing you guys know I
love anything green tea and ro
all right another item that I have been
enjoying is the immediate diamond heart
based primer in the illuminating version
this is the illuminating soft focus I
need to figure out if this is a
cruelty-free brand or not but this is
gorgeous I love I just love the
consistency I love the way that it kind
of blurs my imperfections it does have
kind of a peachy color to it and I just
think it looks great on the skin I do
feel like it helps to you know make my
foundation wear longer throughout the
day I don't even know if you guys are
gonna be able to see that but I really
just like what it does for my face so
yeah I would like to purchase a full
size of that if it is cruelty free
alright the next item that I have been
loving is my clear pore cleanser / a
mask from Neutrogena I have purchased I
think probably 32 of these look in the
past eight years I'm not even kidding
this is something that I have been using
for years for years for years I do need
to find a different option after I empty
this one adds because Neutrogena does
test on animals but this is the benzoyl
peroxide 3.5% um you know acne wash so
this is absolutely fantastic you can use
it as a mask or just as a cleanser like
I said when I am breaking out I feel
like benzoyl peroxide is really really
good for my breakouts that and glycolic
acid so this has definitely been a
favorite two more products that were
sent to me from Charlotte Tilbury that
again I have been loving you probably
saw me quite a few times this week are
wearing this baby this is the Charlotte
Tilbury matte lipstick in the shade the
Queen I do not feel like this has a
matte formulation to it it really is
more like a satin kind of color but I
wore this in two Maya 2016 shittiest
makeup video or whatever paired together
with some pink eyeliner I mean pink
eyeshadow on the bottom I thought it
looks so cute together and I just love
this shade it's beautiful it almost
borders on that kind of red color and I
just think it's it's really good I
really really like the way that this
sits on the lips
another item they have here is the lip
cheat what is this reshape and resize
lip liner in the shade pillow-talk I am
not usually someone who uses lip liners
I'm just not that big of a fan but I am
wearing this today a paired together
with my lorac lipstick in the shade
beautiful better sort of colors a little
more on the peachy side there very
creamy very blendable and I feel like it
does make your lips look a little bigger
when you do outline them like I said I
usually don't do that so that was kind
of a new
for me this week but I have been
enjoying that speaking of another
lipstick like I said I am wearing at the
lorac alter-ego highly pigmented
lipstick today in the shade as you can
see a beauty guru this is just a
beautiful pinky purpley lilac color they
don't offer this anymore but I'm sure
you could find another color similar to
it with their alter-ego collection but
it's beautiful love that has a satin
sort of finish to it really really great
and I also have been enjoying my Kat Von
D Alchemist holographic palette so today
I am wearing the shades blue sapphire
and pink opal paired together so blue
sapphire and pink opal I love a nice
Bluegreen pinky highlight I think it
looks awesome
a lot of people aren't into that but I
am so I think this is a great little
palette really really fun to work with
very similar to the moon child palette
from Anastasia Beverly Hills so you
definitely don't need to have both but
this is just a nice one to play with
and I do feel like these go onto the
eyes a lot better which I've been doing
that a little bit this week as well kind
of patting it onto my lid I also have
been loving these two mascaras here the
first one is the balm cosmetics matte
lash this is a black mascara really
really loved the definition and volume
this gives to my lashes it is a very
goopy kind of formula so if you do not
like what mascaras you would not like it
but I am thinking about purchasing a
full size of that and also I really do
love the benefit they're real this has
been a favorite for years and years and
years but it is so so so beautiful and
finally you guys and they last night and
I have been loving is my balm cosmetics
down boy blush so this is can be a
eyeshadow or a blush it's just a
beautiful cool toned kind of color I
feel like it's been pairing together
beautifully with some of those pink
eyeshadows in the chocolate bonbons
palette and also in the holographic
palette from Kat Von D this is what it
looks like and I'm wearing it together
paired with this lipstick and I love it
so anyway guys those are my fails and
holy grails for the week I hope you
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me and I will see you guys
