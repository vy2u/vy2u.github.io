welcome back to my files in holloway
hills where i share with you guys the
products i have been loving this week
and of course the products that i have
not been loving we are going to start
with the ones that i have not been
loving there is actually only one and
we're going to do that so that we can
end things on a good note so anyway this
is the lancome juicy shaker initiated
cherry symphony this has been the fail
for the week I just find that this is
not moisturizing enough for me this time
of year also the where time on this is
incredibly poor like incredibly poor
especially for a lip oil so this is what
the actual applicated applicator looks
like I do love the scent and let the
little sponge tip I like the way it
looks on the lips I do like the color I
just wish it would wear a little longer
and also I wish it was a little more
moisturizing alright let's go ahead and
get into the stuff i have been loving
the first one is from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
this is the aromatherapy sleep night
time T body wash and foam bath so I have
pretty much every single cent within
this collection as you guys probably
know because I showed these a lot I just
like to kind of switch around the sense
every week but this is a soft and
soothing soothing blend of cedar wood
and orange essential oils that help calm
and comfort like tea before bedtime I'm
a huge tea drinker and this really does
kind of smell like chamomile tea like a
little bit of jasmine so I really really
have been enjoying that it is going
everywhere I really have been enjoying
that as my a bubble bath at nighttime I
do have another shower product this is
from OGX this is the intensely
invigorating plus eucalyptus mint body
wash a little ghost such a long way with
this if you were looking for like a good
bang for your buck would highly
recommend checking out these oh gx body
washes you can usually get them for like
buy one get one fifty percent off at
Ulta but anyway this is a experience of
invigorating cooling blend of eucalyptus
mint tea tree oil and out so just a lot
of eucalyptus you guys like honestly the
scent of this the smells like Noxzema
products like it's super super strong in
the eucalyptus department but i will say
i have been using a body scrub this week
that has been leaving a little bit of an
oily residue on my body so what I've
been doing is going in and using a body
wash after because i don't like that
oily residue and i notice that this like
within one little swipe like
even if I'm using like a little loofah
or not it completely takes off that oily
residue so I do think this is a
fantastic body wash it really does rinse
you clean so although I'm not a huge fan
of the scent I will say it works very
very well the next three items I have
been loving are actually food-related
these are called crazy cups I'm Tom and
I ordered these on Amazon I am a huge
coffee drinker but I don't like the
taste of coffee so I really look for
flavored coffees now I do find the
flavored coffees usually aren't that
flavored like they just don't really
taste they taste like coffee they don't
really taste like the actual flavor so I
was looking online for the best like
flavored coffees and everybody was
recommending crazy cups so the first one
that I have been loving this week is the
spiced gingerbread I actually drink this
plane like that is crazy for me you guys
normally I'm huge with creamer and sugar
and all that kind of stuff but I've
actually been drinking this one plane i
also have been loving the pumpkin
vanilla creme this one I do add a little
bit of my international delight pumpkin
pie spice creamer in with and then this
one right here is called frosted oatmeal
cookie and i also have been enjoying
this I like this one with a little bit
of almond milk and sugar so those have
been really really awesome we have been
enjoying them quite a bit they do have
some really weird flavors like peanut
butter and jelly sandwich which Tom and
I are like a neither of us is going to
drink that so we think that next time we
order we'll just go ahead and get like a
specific pack of them like either the
gingerbread or the oatmeal cookie things
like that alright the next item I have
been loving this week is the gosh
cosmetics CC cream this is an
illuminating foundation and this is what
I have been wearing absolutely all week
and I love this I love the way it looks
on the skin you guys it has very very
sheer coverage but it's just the most
gorgeous finish ever and it still
definitely shows stuff through like
right now I'm on my period and I
definitely do have like a little bit of
breakouts and some acne scarring showing
however it just makes your skin look
beautiful and it makes it look like skin
so I really don't mind that it doesn't
have that much coverage I think it's
fantastic and I have been pairing that
together with my Too Faced Born This Way
a naturally radiant concealer this has
been a favorite of mine for quite some
time now the shade that I where is very
fair and I'm thinking next time i'm
going to try the urban decay naked skin
concealer if you guys can believe this i
literally have not even
tried that concealer that I know
everybody talks about it and for someone
who's so obsessed with their color
correcting fluids you would think that I
would have tried that out but I haven't
tried it yet but I've heard this one
he's quite similar but that one gives
maybe a little more coverage but has the
same sort of consistency that's what my
friend just told me so I'm going to try
that one out next but I loved the way
that this paired together with the gosh
cosmetics CC cream this week and if
you're wondering where you can get gosh
cosmetics I bought this when I was in
New York at walgreens so I do know that
is sold in Canada and I'm not going sure
if it's just like an East Coast thing
right now in the US but this is a great
brand I really do you like it and then
I've been wearing very minimal eyeshadow
this week I've been very I've been
wearing very minimal makeup in general
but I have been reaching for my tarts
double duty beauty young wild &amp;amp; free
eyeshadow palette this is the perfect
pocket palette in fact i did a video
called pocket palettes where i showed
this particular palette so i will go
ahead and leave that video down below if
you would like to see my favorite little
pocket palettes that fit in the palm of
your hand but this is what it looks like
on the inside it's got some really
really nice neutral colors but this is
actually really fantastic quality and
very comparable to the tartlet in bloom
and just the regular tartlet palette and
i really do like how this goes on to the
eyes basically does smells very lightly
a vanilla and the two shades that i have
mainly been wearing this week are these
two right here so this one is called
weekend it's more of like a topi kind of
light brown shade and then simple life
is this one I've been tapping that all
over the lid and then going in with a
lot of mascara so speaking of mascara my
combo this week that I have been wearing
is the wet and wild max volume plus
mascara para together with my neighbor
lean the falsies push-up drama a lot of
you been wondering which mascaras I've
been wearing this week it's the two of
those combined together this one has
more of a dry formulation and I think
the other day on snapchat I said both of
them are dry and they're not this one is
dry this one's wet and I like the weed
that they define my lashes i also have
been liking this little guy right here
this is a shade tara organics this is
called the rose hips black soap i
purchased this on amazon probably about
six months ago and i do recommend if you
do open one of these up use it
completely don't like interchange
between products because these do go bad
pretty quickly this is a hundred percent
natural but this is an anti acne
anti-aging wonder soap african black
soap is amazing
the skin if you are someone who cannot
tolerate a lot of benzoyl peroxide
salicylic acid glycolic acid AJ's things
like that I would definitely look into
african black soap but this one also has
rose hips in it which is very nourishing
and beautiful so if you do have maybe
like aging skin that does deal with a
little bit of acne or you're like me
you're like in your mid 20s and you
still get the occasional break outs but
you also want to do some anti-aging I
would highly recommend this checking
this out it's beautiful does smell kind
of weird it does come out completely
like dark brown or black kind of like
charcoal but it really does work well
and if you do have I feel like any kind
of skin type could use this if you do
have sensitive don't leave it on for too
long but what you can do is wet your
face put a pump of it on and leave it on
for a few minutes and it will actually
like the enzymes and there will eat off
the dead layer of the skin so a very
cool product I've been enjoying that I
also have been enjoyed my tart to drink
of h2o hydrating boost this is kind of
what I would describe as a moisturizing
primer I really don't feel like this is
just a moisturizer on its own it is very
very much filled with dometic own and
silicone it has that really really
creamy touch to it it definitely has a
little bit of a citrusy scent more so on
the grapefruit side than like lemon or
lime but yeah this is what it looks like
the actual consistency kind of like a
gel creme but like i said it definitely
has some silicone in there so if you are
someone who really doesn't you're not
that into skin here or you're in a hurry
in the morning this is a great item to
use to moisturize and also prime your
face from makeup and then on the days
where i have been doing like full-on
primer i have been using mine a poline
baby skin instant pore eraser this is a
fantastic dometic own / silicone primer
from the drugstore i really like it i
feel like i only have a point B tiniest
little bit laughs that you might you
might actually see this in my empties
this month but yeah this is a great
little primer been enjoying that I also
have been loving my bow show charcoal
poor pudding this has black and white
charcoal in it and what you do is you
actually take it you mix it together and
then you put it on your face this has
quickly become one of my all-time
favorite mass ever you guys I love the
scent of this I don't know what it is it
doesn't even smell good okay it smells
like a mixture of legs I want to say
like cement and maybe like chlorine
very weird sense but sense that like I
like up so it's got kind of a weird said
thing going on here but this was a
deluxe I sample that I got from typing
in a code on the sephora.com website
probably one of the best deluxe sized
codes that I've ever typed in because
this has lasted me forever I will
definitely be purchasing a full size I
did recently see a kit um on sephora.com
for both ship products and this have
like a full size of this in there but it
all says it also have like a full size
of the bosha luminizing black mask which
I hate and then also I couldn't remember
the other one but there's a few mass for
 that I really like and a few
that I don't like but yeah this one is
very very good highly recommend checking
out if you do have problem skin larger
pores maybe combo to oily skin the next
item I have been loving is this 3 wood
candle right here this is so beautiful
love this packaging this is chestnut in
clothes this is new to me this year and
the reason why I've been loving it this
week is because I did finish it off this
week it is a beautiful scent you guys it
is a mixture of roasted chestnut clove
buds pine cedar wood and velvety moss
and it has a really nice kind of smoky
woodsy scent to it so if you were into
that maybe if you have like a guy that
lives with you or if you are married or
if you have a boyfriend that lives with
you this is a very nice like manly kind
of scent even Tom requested that we burn
this in the bedroom which he never
request that so it smelled amazing and
obviously the packaging is adorable so
I've been loving that and the last item
that I have been loving this week is my
hourglass ambient lighting edit palette
this is the 2015 version so not the
surreal life version the one that came
out this year this is last year's
version and I swear every time I am sick
when I'm not feeling well when I want to
get my makeup done in a hurry I reach
toward this it is such a beautiful
multitasking palette you do get two
different blushes in here you get mode
exposure and also luminous flush and
then this bronzer right here is called
luminous bronze light you do get dim
light which is an ambient lighting
powder right here you get diffused light
which is a beautiful beautiful kind of
yellow toned ambient lighting powder and
then in the middle you have iridescent
light which is an ambient lighting
strobing powder and you guys know how I
feel about those droving powders so
anyway these are beautiful i would say
for blush this week the past couple days
and what i'm wearing today is all three
of these i just take a brush and i swipe
through there and I put it on my cheeks
I love the way that looks and then I
like to buff everything out with dim
light and then I
to use these two to highlight with so
beautiful beautiful palette really
really like these I feel like you're
really into if you're really either into
the ambient lighting formulation or
you're not you either see benefits and
like differences on your skin or you
don't I'm one of the people that loves
it so anyway that is that guys that is
my fails and holy grails for the week I
hope you enjoyed seeing my weekly
favorites let me know down below what
you have been loving and what you have
been hating and I will see you guys
tomorrow for shopping swatch my stash
