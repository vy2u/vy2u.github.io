channel welcome back to my pals and had
a griot so where I share with you guys
new products I have been loving this
week and of course see products I have
not been loving now after this video is
a filmed I will have a little insert
that I'm going to be talking about as
far as my project pan is concerned I am
currently doing a project pan I'm a
little behind on this but it is are they
12 pans of Christmas and project pan
with a bunch of different youtubers and
project planners here in the community
so in the description box actually you
know what in a pinned comment I'm gonna
link all of their channels down below so
that would be the first comment that you
guys see at the top of the comment
section and I would love you guys went
over and showed them some love because I
was very very appreciative that they did
include me in this clap but without
further ado let's go ahead and talk
about the products that I love this week
of course the products I didn't like and
then we will get into the project pan
stuff there were no fails for this week
I actually have been really enjoying
everything that I shot my stash for the
first three items I have here are
actually a brushes so the first one that
I've been enjoying is from Luxy this is
the large angled of 504 brush I have
been using this with my bronzer splash
of blush it's kind of like a mixture
which I'll show you guys in a second I
just love the way I can pick up product
here because these are really nice and
densely packed and bristles in here and
I love just stippling it right onto my
cheeks it fits the apples of my cheeks
really nicely and I just like the
contour going on here so I do enjoy that
brush I also have been loving this Real
Techniques of blend and blur brush now
and they did go ahead and send me a PR
package featuring all the new blend and
blur brushes I am NOT a fan of the
smaller ones I don't know what it is but
they're just too densely packed I have a
hard time contouring with them I have a
hard time using the eye one but I will
say the large body one and the
foundation one are perfect these are
beautiful do not go and spend $180 on
those artista brushes when you can pick
something like this up at the drugstore
they're fantastic I actually put the
foundation right on top of the bristles
because these kind of bristles because
it is such a densely packed mermaid kind
of brush they do not soak up or eat up
of the product so you can just apply it
directly to your skin it puts on
foundation beautifully the only thing I
worry about is that I feel like I kind
of tug at my skin a little more when I
use brushes like this but you know what
these are great I absolutely love the
way my foundation goes on I do prefer
sponges still I love my
techniques miracle complexion sponge but
this is definitely the best of feast
brush in my collection currently even
over like my Sigma f80 so really have
been enjoying that and then here I've
been loving this little tart to
double-ended brush I've got to this I
think in the Nicole conceal EO
collection or maybe it was last days
last year's holiday collection I've been
using this with my highlight this week I
like this little tiny side here for
going down the bridge of my nose on my
Cupid's bow as well as on my chin and
then the bigger side I love dipping in
and just kind of going ahead and putting
a strong strobing kind of freaking light
on my face I don't know how else to
describe it it's really really nice it's
very soft and for a while here I didn't
really know what to use this brush for
you can you office Li can be used for
multiple things but I really do like it
for a highlight alright guys as far as
setting powder is concerned this week I
have been loving at my Kat Von D luck a
translucent setting powder I did talk
about this in yesterday's video so I'll
go ahead and throw that video up in the
cards if you would like to check it out
this really makes my foundation last
absolutely all day long and I really do
enjoy it with multiple different
foundations but I prefer the most with
like a lightweight foundation so today I
am wearing the Armani luminous silk
foundation I obviously purchased that
before going cruelty free I have about
one layer I think a pump and a half of
that on my face today I applied it with
this brush and then I go in and I kind
of stipple this powder on I don't like
the press version of this locket powder
but I wish this wasn't so messy I'm not
a huge fan of like really really really
messy loose powders like this usually
but I will say this is great for baking
it is nice to just dust all over the
face and lock that foundation and all
day long so I have been loving my Kat
Von D lock-it like I said I wish I could
find a press version that I bet you know
what liked a little more I didn't like
the press version of this it just didn't
feel similar to this one at all but
attack yeah anyway long story short I
enjoy it moving on and this is the
highlight that I've been loving this
week it is Prosecco pop it is from Becca
desertion rescan Perfector press I've
been adoring this like I said I go in
with that tart brush to just kind of
pick it up and then I put it right on
two of my cheekbones I love the color of
this it definitely leaves me a little
golden some of you've been saying it
looks like your highlights a little dark
for you this week but I feel like mixed
together with the blush I have been
using it's been really really nice
so the blush that I have been using is
from natee oh this is that the Volusia
and bronze in the shade sunkissed my
friend actually sent this all the way
from Australia to me so thank you so
much mag that was a very very sweet of
you this is a cruelty-free I believe
drugstore brand that you can get in
Australia and I love swirling it
together with this little brush right
here and then just stamping it right
onto the apples of my cheeks mixed
together with Prosecco pop it leaves
this beautiful golden glow so I've been
loving the two of those together as far
as setting my face and is concerned this
week in the wet and wild natural finish
setting spray ah this is a the
rediscovered love you guys this is
honestly mmm yes it smells so good it
smells like cherries this is honestly
one of the best setting sprays in my
collection it has such a powerful mr. as
you guys can see so you do want to hold
it a little like further away from your
face but it is such a good setting spray
I wish that you could get a bigger size
because I feel like I go through this
very quickly but I have been loving that
and I do find that a prolongs aware of
my makeup up next we have the Marc
Jacobs velvet who our mascara this is a
special holiday 2017 at packaging you
guys know and this has quickly become
one of my favorite mascaras all I've
really been doing this week is wearing
eyeliner with mascara or just mascara
today all I have in my eyes is just
mascara one layer of this I'm good to go
it gives you the trifecta lashes it
gives you volume that gives you length
as well as definition and then finally
guys the last item I want to talk about
this week was actually sent over from
Michael Todd at beauty this is an
interesting little tool it's called the
sonic sonic clear yeah a sonic care
sonic clear petite this is obviously
kind of like a dupe for a Clarisonic and
I have to say I really been enjoying
this if you guys didn't know Clarisonic
brush heads are not cruelty free so I
have had my Clarisonic with the clip the
Clarisonic brush head on there the luxe
cashmere version for probably over nine
months now it's obviously gunky and
dirty and I can't use it because I'm not
going to repurchase a non cruelty free
brush yet I'm just not gonna do it so I
have been waiting for a cleansing device
that's kind of like the Clarisonic I did
a comparison between the Luna 400 and
the Clarisonic and if you guys watch
that video which I will go ahead and
throw up in the cards if you'd like to
check it out I talked about how I prefer
my Clarisonic so I was using all these
little silicone brush kind of cleansers
and little different tools for a while
there
I have been wanting to find a
cruelty-free dupe for a Clarisonic and I
have to say this is basically the same
thing the only thing I will say is that
the brush hood here is a little scratch
here I'm going to see if they have
different replacement heads but honestly
this is fantastic if you're looking for
a cheaper alternative to the Clarisonic
and out something that is cruelty free I
would definitely suggest a little
Michael Todd Santa Clara petite it does
have three different levels of settings
here and I usually leave it on the first
one just because like I said the brush
head is a little bit on the scratchy
side and I notice that my skin starts to
feel a little bra and chapped but
overall and very impressed with this and
so happy I found a cruelty free
alternative to the Clarisonic and if you
guys are curious and this is the
cleanser that I've been pairing with it
this week I for a wild thought that this
was breaking the outs but it turns out
it's not this it was actually a makeup
product I was testing out this week and
this is the ko green tea spinach
vitamins age prevention cleanser I'll
talk about that other product Robley in
next week's fails and holy grails the
one that was breaking me out a little
bit I found a way to make it work and I
do like the product but we'll talk about
that next week but yeah this is the age
prevention cleanser I'm loving this from
the youth to the people line I'm loving
all of the products from the youths of
the people line if you're looking for an
awesome cruelty-free and vegan skincare
brand would highly recommend you guys
check that out so anyway guys now let's
go ahead and jump into the project pan
shall we alright guys now let's talk
about my intro and my update on the
twelve pounds of Christmas I chose out
twelve different products that I want to
use up by Christmas I've actually been
working on these products since the end
of October and that is when the
collaboration started I'm definitely Way
behind than all the other ladies like I
said I will have their channels link
down below as well as their update
videos if they have any but I have been
working on these products I want to get
through them I do project pans once in a
while I have a whole entire playlist
dedicated to project pans but I wouldn't
necessarily call myself a project pander
you know like I don't do it very very
often and I do feel like you know I
purchased a lot of products so usually
project panners like to kind of minimize
their collection and things like that
but I still think it's important to use
up products that you do have so anyway
let me show you guys everything that I
have been using I will have inserts here
as well so the first item is the Beca
first light priming a filter I'm gonna
have a little insert close up here so
you guys can see where I started and
where I am now
I think this is an absolutely beautiful
primer if you do have more combo oily
skin but it's just not working amazingly
for me right now so I would like to use
that up by a December what 24th 25th up
next we have a non cruelty free of
products and I feel like it's very
important especially if you have
transitioned into a cruelty-free
lifestyle to make sure that you do use
up those other products that are non
cruelty free some people declutter them
I feel like it's a waste to just toss
them a lot of people say why do you
still show products like that already
still use products like that because I
purchase them before growing cruelty
free it doesn't make sense for me to
just throw them away that's just not
fair it's not fair to the animals it's
not fair to me it's just not fair but
this is the l'oreal colour riche a bulb
i've had this in a project pan before
again i will do an insert here so you
guys can see how much product i have
left there really isn't too much left
but it's a really really comfortable
bomb and it's just something that i
would like to see myself get through i
am able to get through lip products
pretty darn quickly so we shall see
about that up next i happy to face
hangover RX 3 and 1 we're punishing
setting spray I just don't love this and
I feel like I have other setting sprays
in my collection that I do enjoy more
kind of like the one that I just showed
the wet and wild photo focus natural
finish setting sprays so I'm about
halfway through this one and I hope to
be able to finish that up
up next we do have some mascaras here
the first one is the L'Oreal telescopic
carbon black of this is definitely
starting to go bad so I want to finish
that off here is the Bobbi Brown smoky
lash mascara this is also really really
it nice I'm gonna have a natural bristle
wand very very densely packed bristles
in here but it is starting to dry out so
I would like to use that up and then
this is the Laura Mercier extra lash
sculpting mascara it has kind of like a
death whan this thing looks like a damn
medieval torture tool but I just feel
like this is starting to get a little
goopy and it needs to be something that
I use up so those are the 3 mascaras I'm
working on here we have the L'Oreal
visible lift color lift a blush in the
shade rose gold this is a beautiful
blush you guys can see I started to hit
pan so I have been working on this I've
been using it as an eye shadow as well
as a highlight as well as they blush
topper I'm not a huge fan of cream
product so I really want to see myself
use this up it is a beautiful product
but obviously not something I would
repurchase
up next we have the bare minerals or
sighs total cleansing oil oh my goodness
I purchased one of these probably about
three months ago and I actually brought
it back to the store I returned it to
Alton because I hated it
and then my mom was telling me all about
a cleansing oil that she had found that
she loves she said she had a double and
she didn't remember what the brand was
so she said can I send it to you I said
oh sure I opened it up and I realized
it's the bare mineral oil obsessed total
cleansing oil this stings my eyes I get
an allergic reaction from whatever
fragrance is in here kind of smells like
rosemary or something like that so what
I've been using with this guy is
actually going ahead and using it to
remove swatches so I do want to see
myself finish this up obviously I can't
return this one since my mom bought it
but I did go ahead and make some
progress on this guy really nice for
removing swatches no problem with that I
just can't use it on at my face up next
we do have the elf hydrating a bubble
mask that this is what it looks like and
I can't really show you guys where I am
with this I don't really know where I am
with this because the lid here and the
cap it's very confusing I don't know how
much product I have left but I'm not in
love with this I like it but I'm not in
love with it so I'd like to go ahead and
use that up before it goes bad your is
the L'Oreal infallible Pro matte
foundation you really really can't see
where I am on this product because I did
shake it up by accident but I started
right about there and I've made it to
here so let's see if I can finish this
up it's a beautiful foundation obviously
not cruelty free but you know what I
should enjoy it I do like it and I want
to finish it up and enjoy it here is an
it cosmetics bye bye pours poreless a
finish airbrush powder initiated
translucent I do enjoy this it's a
beautiful powder but I have six of these
open in my collection right now so let's
see if we can go ahead and get through
that and then finally guys the balm
cosmetics put a little niche eyelid a
primer I am currently a right about
there as you guys can see I would say I
have maybe a third left of this product
so this one will be tough but we'll see
if I can make it through so anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed my fails and holy
grails and my update on my Christmas
project pan thank you so much for
joining me guys and I will see you
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
