welcome back to my things and how do I
use where I share with you guys the
products I have not been loving this
week in the products of course i have
been loving mr. badger is here with me
today because a lot of you have been
requesting to have him in more videos
now he is super super antsy as you guys
can see all of you yes he's very very
antsy as you guys can probably see so
I'm going to go ahead and put him down
or at least put him next to me in a
Sephora box please don't eat anything in
there um but yeah let's go ahead and get
into the weekly favorites and the non
favorites so the first item that was
definitely not a favorite this week is
from the SD edit by Estee Lauder this is
called the pink peony overnight water
pack I don't know how a product can be
such a little piece of honestly I
think this does absolutely nothing for
my skin I don't know what is going on
here it basically is just this really
really thin pink kind of gel if you guys
can see and I honestly feel like it does
nothing for my skin so I don't feel like
it hydrates I don't feel like it does
anything overnight for my skin so this
is definitely something that I would not
purchase in a full size nor would I
recommend to you guys the second fail
for the week is this advantage by
jessica live skinned or liebeskind this
is an illuminating face highlighter in
the shade rose gold so and this is what
it looks like and honestly you guys this
just has a very very chunky thick kind
of consistency to it it drives me crazy
kind of like this little guy so this is
what it looks like and I just feel like
it's very chunky it's very very thick
and it doesn't look good on the skin it
really emphasizes a lot of texture and
fine lines and I just don't like putting
that on as a highlight in this area so
what I've been doing this week is
actually putting it on as a blush topper
and I actually think it looks a lot
better that way so I don't really know I
think it looks good as the blush topper
as a highlight it's not good whatsoever
i may try it as an eyeshadow all over my
lid but i think i will have to foil it
quite a bit and the final field for the
week has definitely been my alta plush
drama Volume Mascara if this is what it
looks like I just feel like the
formulation on this is very strange I
feel like it doesn't pick up the product
evenly on the actual brush so this is
what the brush looks like I feel like
it's very very wet towards the top a
little dry towards the bottom definitely
not my favorite mascara I will go ahead
and use it up but i don't know i had to
layer another mascara on top today to
get this to work all right I didn't have
a fragrance pairing this week I have
been loving so let's go ahead and get
into the Holy Grails and that is the
clean warm cotton rollerball pair to get
with the victoria's secret pink warm and
cozy body mist this is what the two of
them look like I have oh my god I have
the clean warm cotton unlike my pressure
points and then I just sprayed this and
missed it it all over my body misted it
I've missed it all over my body it's
absolutely beautiful I love this
fragrance pairing this really does smell
like warm fresh laundry and this just
smells like coconut and vanilla so the
two of those go together really really
nicely I do have a product here that's
in between a fail and a Holy Grail and
that is the honest hacia Beverly Hills
lip gloss in the shade of fudge so I
like this color I think it's absolutely
beautiful but I find even when I wear a
lip liner that this goes outside of my
lip line so if you guys have any sort of
recommendation on what I can do with
these anastacio Beverly Hills lip
glosses please let me know as far as
like where time is concerned and also
just like keeping it inside of my lip
line because I have a really really hard
time all right um I do have another
product here that I have been loving
it's actually a little duo here these
are skincare items so these are the
Neutrogena hydroboost water gel with
hyaluronic acid and the hydro boost gel
cream for eyes so this is an eye cream
as you guys can see this is a facial
moisturizer I have completely used that
up so you will see that in my January
2016 empties because our I'm sorry 2017
empties because I did already go ahead
and film my empties for December but yes
this is a beautiful beautiful light
wheat sort of moisturizer I feel like
it's very similar to the clinic Moisture
Surge extended thirst relief gel creme
they actually do have a gel creme
version of this so if you are very very
dry get the gel creme if you're more
oily go ahead and get the water gel and
then the eye cream is just a very very
basic but it works really really well
I've been using that in the morning and
at night and I really do like it alright
moving on the next item I have been
loving is the studio makeup on the go
eyeshadow palette in the cool down
version so this is really really
beautiful i love a lot of the shades in
here i will say these matte shades down
here this one and also this one are a
little on the chalky side and there's
definitely a lot of fallout with these
more metallo sized finishes but they're
beautiful beautiful colors so anyway let
me show you guys some swatches that is
what they look like I just highly
recommend using something they're really
really has a lot of like a tacky base to
it so use a glitter glue or something
like that go ahead and you
a setting spray and really really foil
these onto your eyes if you're gonna you
know want to put it on your lid but
overall they're beautiful i feel like
they blend pretty nicely the darker
shades definitely are a little harder to
blend but they still look really nice on
the eye so i have been enjoying that
palette i also have been enjoying the
combination oh my god are getting all
sniffily thanks a lot mr. badger anyway
I have been enjoying this little
combination right here this is the estee
lauder double wear stay-in-place
foundation in the shade ivory one-on-one
I've renewed and also the bios Anthony
nourish our precious rose face oil I
loved the two of these together somebody
was saying yesterday in my look of the
week video that they love mixing their
Estee Lauder Double Wear together with
almond oil so try a mixing together your
estee lauder double wear with an oil
this time of year it's beautiful really
love the way the finished looks i also
have been enjoying these two little eye
liners or eye pencils so the first is
the smashbox i wish our poor waterproof
kohl liner in the shade storm it is just
a slate gray shade and i think this
looks absolutely beautiful on the actual
water line i am really falling in love
with the smashbox always sharp kohl
eyeliner pencils i just think they go on
really nicely sometimes they do feel a
little too sharp and they stab me in the
eye but then again i think i'm just too
aggressive when I put my actual makeup
on and then this is the bobbi brown
long-wear cream shadow stick in the
shade of shadow and i tried putting this
on my waterline this week it actually
kind of got stuck on like my lashes and
stuff like that but it's beautiful if
you do want to hit underneath your lower
lash line or just all over your eyelid
as an actual cream shadow alright moving
on I have also been loving my tart is a
blush palette from Tarte to this is what
it looks like the shade that I have on
today is called love which is that this
one it's just a beautiful really really
neutral kind of basic a blush color I
mean tart tart is very basic and a
neutral so anyway all of the shades in
here are beautiful the only one that
really stands out on the cheeks in my
opinion is this shade right here but
it's a gorgeous gorgeous palette you
guys really do enjoy this I think that
this was a limited edition but if they
ever bring it back I would highly
recommend checking it out i also have
been loving my steel of aqua glow
perfecting base so this is something i'm
trying to use up by march i think yeah
and it's just beautiful i love the way
that this goes on it's very cooling it
kind of has like a sticky or tacky base
to it so that when you're applying it
it's QC mr. badger is gonna kill me
when you're applying it really does um
you know have your foundation adhere to
your skin nicely but then it does dry
down to eight powdery finish so i really
like this i think it's a beautiful
beautiful primer and i would highly
recommend checking that out and let's
see here i also have been loving this
little guy this is the laura geller
baked highlighter in you shade portofino
so when you look at this it actually
seems like it has a more golden or
yellowy undertone to it however when you
actually put it on the skin I have it on
today it really gives off a silver
iridescent which is really interesting
and now I wasn't wearing this when I was
on stage this week just because I
thought it looked a little too shiny and
with the lights coming down on me I just
thought it made me look a little oily
and I want to be as mad as i can when
I'm on stage but I do think it's
beautiful really really nice and
lightweight it definitely doesn't
emphasize texture or fine lines like
that vintage rose gold highlight does so
I have been enjoyed that quite a lot
Anna the last item I have of course been
loving is my essence all about Matt
fixing compact powder I know I talked
this to the ground like I know I talk
about those all the time you guys but I
really do love it I have hit some baby
pan on this little guy it's just a
wonderful wonderful Matt's face powder
so anyway those are my fills in holy
grails for the week you definitely let
me know down below what you have been
loving and hating and I will see you
guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
