channel I'll welcome back to my pals and
had a bio so where I share with you guys
the products I have been loving this
week and of course the products I have
not been loving let's go ahead and just
jump right into the fails there are
three for this week and the first one is
actually a concealer I tried out a while
ago before obviously NARS decide it
should not be cruelty free anymore this
is the NARS creamy concealer in the
shade Chantilly I actually returned to
this but recently one of my friends from
New York one of my friends that I had in
school when I was in conservatory sent
this over to me and it was so sad
breaking the news to her that these are
not cruelty free or that NARS no longer
cruelty free she is actually a hughes
and huge enthusiast when it comes to
vegan and cruelty-free makeup and she
didn't even know which is really sad but
anyway she did send this over to me for
me to try out now that my skin is a
little more on the dry side and you guys
I still hate this I don't know what it
is about the NARS radiant creamy
concealer but I don't find it very
radiant I don't find it very creamy in
fact I feel like this has a very moosie
texture to it and it's awfully drying on
the eyes so for me this is just not the
concealer for me I'm not a huge fan
whatsoever I know a lot of people rave
about this but I have never liked this
so I will be going ahead and
decluttering that baby
alright guys moving on we have the it
cosmetics secret sauce moisturizer thank
god this is in a deluxe size because I
can't even use this on my face there's
something about the consistency of this
that totally freaks me out
it's very slimy and I feel like there
are we too many claims on this
particular moisturizer
I hate when brands have a lot of claims
on a moisturizer or any sort of skin
care product because then you're
expecting some sort of result and this
really doesn't do that much it really
sits on top of the skin I can't get it
to properly absorb into my skin in the
first place and honestly it's not that
great at moisturizing I would much
prefer using something like a hobo oil
like this one which I will talk about in
a minute so yeah be clinically advanced
miraculous anti-aging moisturizer secret
sauce from it cosmetics is really not
that secret or saucy oh hey honey
alright guys let's move on to the
origins ginseng refreshing eye cream
this is the last fail of the week I had
a little deluxe eyes at this
unfortunately origins is not a
cruelty-free brand I know they seemed
like they would be but they are not but
anyway I used to love this refreshing
eye cream
and I had more combo ailee skin but I
hate this now I hate it I actually feel
like this strips a moisture out of my
under eye area again these two products
right here really just don't look good
on my under eye area so I am going to go
ahead and let this baby go I tried using
it up because I had the little deluxe
eyes but there's probably only one use
left maybe I'll finish it off but you
guys will for sure see that in an
empties video alright guys now let's go
ahead and talk about the good products
this week and the Holy Grails the first
one is from Stila this is the perfect
mean perfect cube pallets in medium /
tan it is what I have on my eyes today I
have been pairing that together this
week with a nice teal luck glitter and
glow in the shade of gold of Goddess
I've started to hit some pan on this as
you guys can see but I love this palette
I love these palettes you guys these are
amazing a for travel you get two
different blushes and then you do get
five different eyeshadows I love the
medium / tan version and the deep / no
the medium / tan version and the tan /
deep first and version because I'm
really really drawn to these rose gold
and warmer kind of eyeshadows so this is
definitely one of my favorite so they
are a little harder to blend so I did
want to let you guys know that
especially these two shades right here
but I did work that lighter kind of
Brown cool tone shade into at my crease
today on my lower lash line I took this
guy as my transition of some all over
lid shade is a little too dark for that
but it is a great transition and then on
my lid like I said I went in with the
Stila glitter and glowing gold goddess
you guys know I'm a huge fan of these
and like I said I'm starting to have a
little pan on this one so I would
definitely a repurchase some of the
Stila glitter and glows are better than
others and this is one of the good ones
so just want to let you guys know all
right I have a perfume favorite for the
week it is this baby right here this is
the Elizabeth and James of bourbon
perfume one of you told me and actually
a friend sent over a little list of
cruelty free and vegan perfumes I had no
idea they were cruelty free and vegan
but they are this is a great brand
really really love their perfumes I love
Nirvana white I love Nirvana black I
also love rose scent mixed together with
bourbon so I'm so happy that this is a
cruelty free I had no idea that
Elizabeth and James was it's very hard
to find cruelty free perfumes to be
completely honest but yeah I've been
loving this this week it smells very
woodsy very a very aromatic and kind of
you know if you're burning wood that's
kind of what this smells like so if
you're into scents like that you would
definitely enjoy this all right as far
as foundation is concerned this week I
have been going for a my Smashbox
Studios skin 15 hour we're hydrating
foundation and they shade it that I
personally wear is called one point one
it is maybe just a tinge darker for me
I'm usually when I have two layers of
self-tanner on which I currently do
right now it looks pretty darn good but
you may be able to see a little bit of
discrepancies between my face and my
neck currently but this is a beautiful
foundation I cannot believe it's so
hydrating yet it lasts all day long I'm
so happy I picked this up if you do have
normal to dry skin I would highly
recommend you look into this so I have
been loving the Smashbox Studios skin at
foundation up next we have the Cape
Blanca Hoba oil now this was actually
sent over a for PR and originally it
came in this huge bottle and I kind of
thought there should be used all over
the body or in the hair on the scalp or
something like that because of my lupus
scarring on my scalp I haven't really
been able to use anything except for
oils on there and the prescription
shampoos and conditioners I have so I
did start by using this on my scalp as
well as my hair but I quickly
transitioned this over to my face I've
actually been using this as my
moisturizer all week because I wasn't
happy with that eye cream I wasn't happy
with this face cream so I've been using
about a dropper full of this on my face
and my neck and my décolleté I do a
blend it in with this product right here
which is the Michael Todd sonic hair
eraser Pro both of these are the two
products that were sent to me for PR
this little guy right here I still need
to use a little more I feel like this is
one of those tools that you have to use
for a while to kind of see if there are
any sort of differences but I will say I
love the way that this makes it the oil
sink into my skin this is a really nice
lightweight oil reminds me kind of like
sweet almond oil so if you do have more
combo oily skin I could see you liking
this and it's working for me as far as
dry skin is concerned and then the
little tool like I said this is one of
those things you put it on to your skin
and it starts to vibrate the point of
this is that it actually pushes the
product further into your skin you
probably noticed with serums as well as
oil sometimes they just don't absorb
properly so what you do is you kind of
go in circular motions all over the skin
I immediately see that I'm a little
flush which is good that means that
there is blood flow going to the front
of my skin or the blood flow increasing
in my skin which is really good for
building collagen and all sorts of
things but I don't
any sort of dramatic results yet but
again I feel like this is a tool I need
to use for a few more weeks so I will
continue to use that guy but so far when
it comes to absorbing oils quickly that
does a great job I feel like I can go
immediately in with my makeup after
applying this with this little twirl
right here
alright guys moving on we have a
lipstick here this is the NYX butter
lipstick in the shade root beer float it
has been on my lips always long I'm
obsessed with this color this is like my
perfect your lips but better a Mavi sort
of shade I need a full-size of this
lipstick it goes on beautifully the only
complaint that I have is it does start
to travel outside the lip line I'm
already really shitty of putting my
makeup on especially when it comes to
lipstick I mean I put it on pretty
sloppy today because it's so we can I
have a little more time to get ready but
and this is definitely a beautiful
beautiful shade I love the formula I
just need to make sure I find a good
eyeliner to pair it with not an eyeliner
fucking lip liner and a parent with are
you guys up next moving on we do have
two cleansers here this one is actually
an exfoliating cleanser and this one is
just a true cleanser I've been using
this to double cleanse this week it is
the Ola Henriksen the truth no I'm sorry
the clean truth foaming cleanser so this
is the one that kind of smells like
orange creamsicles it's supposed to be
nice for brightening the skin I just
really like the consistency of that it
comes out and it's a true foam and I
feel like it's really nice nice for that
double cleanse so if you go in with a
cleansing oil and then you need a double
cleanse I think that's not gonna strip
your skin or exfoliate it too much or
dry your skin out this is really really
nice so I think I want to go ahead and
purchase a full-size of this one or the
red tea foaming cleanser and then right
here we have the be fine food skincare
exfoliating cleanser with brown sugar
sweet almond and oats now I posted a
picture of this on Instagram and a lot
of you were telling me that you got this
in your past empty bag and I'd have to
say this is one of those products that I
have actually been using since I was a
sophomore in college now obviously not
this particular tube but I have been
testing this out for a very long time
I'm not quite sure if they're cruelty
free statuses but this has been sitting
for over eight months in my collection
but I did recently just open it back up
so you know I mean it's really really
nice the thing about this is that it's
almost like food grade you literally can
eat it but it kind of comes out in this
thick consistency is sort of sticky it
depends on how much cleansing properties
you want or how much exfoliating
properties you want they recommend
getting your face a wet and then taking
a small amount if you rub it together
the little granules of the brown sugar
will start to melt and dissolve and then
it turns into
foaming cleanser so on the days where
you want more exfoliating you can kind
of leave your skin a little more dry and
then on the days where you just want the
true cleanser you can really really
dampen it up and it will just
immediately turn into that really soft
beautiful foam but if this really makes
my skin feel clean I loved it when I had
oily skin way back in college I was
super oily and had a lot of cystic acne
and then I also really liked it when I
had combo oily and now when I have to
ride this is just a really a really good
exposure so would highly recommend
looking into this especially if they are
cruelty free and finally guys the last
item I have here is the beach and matte
baked hydrating of bronzer this is from
Laura Geller I feel like I've been
talking about this a little more
recently it's kind of become my go-to
bronzer over my moremore butter bronzer
that's definitely my all-time Holy Grail
but I've been reaching for this guy a
lot the shade I have is called sunrise
fair and it just really blends in nicely
when I do have a layer two of self
tanner on so yeah I've been enjoying
that and I just kind of go around the
outer perimeters of my face of where the
Sun would naturally hit so anyway guys
and those are my fails and holy grails
for the week i'll let me know down below
what your feels and holy grail sorry for
the week and i guess i will see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
