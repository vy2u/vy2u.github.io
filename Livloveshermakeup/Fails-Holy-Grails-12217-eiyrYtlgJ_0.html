welcome back to my battles and contrails
where I share with you guys the products
I have been loving this week and of
course the products I have not been
loving so we are going to start with the
fail if you are curious as to why we're
tilted this way this week it is because
or today I should say it's because Bell
fell off of the wall and I need to taper
back up so anyway the feel for this week
is the iconic class mega volume at
lacquer mascara from butter LONDON
I do not think the formulation of this
is that special nor is the wand to these
little ball part or the ball tip really
has been poking me in the eye all week
so I have not been enjoying this at all
but yeah let's go ahead and talk about
the good stuff shall we the first one is
from only Henrickson this is the Greece
relief facial water it purifies and
mattifies the skin if you use this
exactly the way that they tell you to it
really does work you basically spray it
onto a cotton pad and then you go in
circular motions it will completely
completely mattify your skin so I have
been loving that a lot because I have
been kind of greasy and then I've been
dry and then greasy again and then dry
has been all over the place so that has
been helpful I also have been loving my
NARS Velvet Matte skin tint as this does
have broad-spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen in
it
I rarely shared shade the shade Tarun
wave a late zero or zero one and it's
just so beautiful you guys it has a
really nice Demi matte or semi matte
kind of appearance to the skin so or it
leaves that appearance on the skin so I
really do enjoy this and has nice medium
buildable
almost like full coverage so I've been
enjoying that I also have been loving my
Dior what is this Dior skin nude air
Luminizer in the shade zero zero one
gorgeous gorgeous packaging and although
this isn't a true highlight on my skin
aka it is not lighter than my skin tone
it still gives me a beautiful glow it's
a nice nude color with a little bit of a
peachy iridescent in it alright actually
I do have another fail I have to add in
here so like I said I've been going
between being really oily this week and
also really dry and I just feel like
this in general didn't work for my skin
this week it is the I like apricot
whipped moisturizer so this is what it
looks like it is all organic ingredients
it smells really good it's cruelty free
but I feel like I can only use this in
the summer time when I am at my earliest
so it just doesn't play well with like
other mattifying products I feel like it
really really doesn't give me enough
moisture so although I do like it I just
feel like it's not
good one for me this week all right I
have also been loving the skin at diva
100% pure hyaluronic acid this is
literally just a hyaluronic acid that
you add into your moisturizer and also
into your serums and things like that so
when I add this into here it still
doesn't give me enough moisture but
mostly what hyaluronic acid does is it
binds the moisture that you already have
on your face into like your face does
that make sense so if you have a
moisturizing cream it will go ahead on
top of that bind that moisture in so
this was actually sent to me for like an
Instagram brand now I usually say no
when people ask me for PR through an
Instagram brand just cuz like I don't
know they they seem a little Shady
honestly some of the companies seemed
slightly shady to me and when they sent
me everything I was like okay guess I'll
try it so I still have to try out the
vitamin C serum that they sent me but
honestly this is really good they are
cruelty free vegetarian and non-gmo it
reminds me a lot of the Paula's Choice
hyaluronic acid booster and this is
cheaper so anyway I did want to go ahead
and put that out there I have been
enjoying that I also have been loving
the Olli Henriksen ultimate lift a gel
this is an eye gel or eye cream that I
actually feel like does something a lot
of i jealous and eye creams don't do
that much except for moisturize the
under eye area I don't feel like they
firm or brighten some do but for me
personally I just feel like the majority
of them don't now I do have like 13 open
in my collection right now but I
definitely don't think you need to have
an eye cream you can just use the
moisturizer and bring it up under
underneath your eyes and also on your
eyelids the one that you're using every
day but this is really really nice
it really firms and kind of it's like
elastic on your eyes so it really just
kind of goes like it and I really like
it so yeah I have been enjoying that I
also have been loving my Clinique what
is this cheek pop in the shade peach pop
so I did choose this one out for shop my
stash this past week as well as a blush
from Physicians Formula I prefer this
one hands-down even though it is more
warm toned it's so beautiful
it's kind of sheer on the skin but you
really can build it up and it has a
gorgeous glow to it so I've been loving
that I also have been loving the Queen
howleen and mint julep mask oh my god I
love this stuff is great you do get
eight grams of product see here it says
that it helps with pimples blackheads
and enlarged pores I only notice that it
helps with pimples but it really also
helps with mattifying the skin so again
if you are an oily beast you might want
to pick this up I think you can get it
for under $5 at Walgreens I would just
hit myself
I also have been loving my YSL Bethany
on Deb this is the pop order glossy
stain in the shade 5:22 dewy red now I
will not be repurchasing from YSL since
they do a test their products on animals
but I have to say I love their lip
products so I'm looking for some dudes
if you know of something that is kind of
like this where it's like that glossy
stain please let me know because I
really do love this color and I just
love the formulation as well alright I
do have a hand cream here this is the
Crabtree &amp;amp; Evelyn I think I got this in
a glossy box like five months ago it's
called the La Source ultra moisturizing
hand therapy it smells like the beach
and I feel like it just gives the
perfect amount of moisture to the hands
so I have been enjoying that a lot this
week and like I said it smells
absolutely amazing alright and then I
house also also also have been enjoying
the muttered renaissance palette from
Anastasia Beverly Hills even though I
haven't been feeling very good this week
I will say I have used a shade in here
every single day that I was wearing
makeup so whether it's tempura or
Vermeer and Primavera on my lid or I
really want to get smoky and put like
real gar and love-letter together it's
just beautiful and I will be going ahead
and doing a tutorial for you guys on
that like charge of rainforest of the
sea volume 2 palette and very soon and
also I know you guys like the look that
I put together with this so I will also
do that but yeah just so so so gorgeous
I'm sorry that I didn't get to look at
the week this week like I said I haven't
been feeling that great but this is an
amazing palette probably my favorite of
the year you know what it is my favorite
of the year even though it's 2017 now it
probably will remain to be my favorite
for the year
alright I also have been enjoying the
Clinique take the day off cleansing balm
now Clinique does tests on animals so
I'm not gonna get a full-size of this
but I wanted to show it out so that one
of you could recommend something that is
similar I'm sure there is something
similar on the market what I really like
about this is it takes your makeup off
in a really really gentle way kind of
like a cleansing oil but this is
different from a cleansing oil it just
feels really bomb like it feels
luxurious and I like this because it's
fragrance free so please let me know if
you know of a cruelty free option I feel
like the balm cosmetics
take the day off they have something
kind of similar to that I think there's
also called take the day off it's not
possible maybe it's not I don't know
what I'm thinking of but both of my mom
and I use this currently right now it's
amazing I'm taking off even waterproof
eye makeup and we both want to switch to
something cruelty free so let me know
down below if
and finally the last item that I have
been loving is from it cosmetics it is
the you sculpted palette I do have it on
today I don't know if I'm that great at
contouring if you really can see a
difference in like the shape of my face
but I love this shape right here which
is called soft contour I think it does
an amazing amazing job at just giving a
really nice nice like natural look to
the skin if that makes sense so although
I won't be using this in shop my stash
this coming week I did use it today and
I think it's beautiful so I hope you
guys enjoyed my weekly favorites and
fails I really can't speak today I'm
filming this so late at night
um but yeah that is pretty much it I
will see you guys tomorrow thank you for
joining me like I said</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
