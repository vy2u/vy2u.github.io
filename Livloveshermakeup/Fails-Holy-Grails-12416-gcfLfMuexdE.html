welcome back to my pals and Holograms
where I share with you guys the products
I have been loving this week and of
course the products that I have not been
loving so we're gonna go ahead and start
with the fail after using this for an
entire week this is definitely I think
this is a fail I actually I'm pretty
darn sure it's a fail this is the two
feet of magic chocolate chip palette to
fit mitt I can't speak to faced Matt
chocolate chip palette so I'm just not
loving this has been like the center of
my attention all week this one and the
white chocolate because I was
trying them out for shop my stash I've
been using them for look of the week and
then on top of that I was reviewing them
so hmm
got something on my lip anyway so they
have kind of been the center of my
attention the whole entire week and
honestly I mean ago I haven't declutter
this two of my friend that I work with
she's really deep beautiful chocolatey
complexion and she did pick this one up
she really likes it and I just think
I'll give it this to her as a backup
because I just don't like it you guys I
I think that it's good quality and it's
nice but Too Faced has released much
much much better matte like eyeshadow
palettes their natural matte palette is
way better than theirs easier to blend
it's not that I don't like the colors
because I actually think the colors are
even better than the original chocolate
bar palette my issue with this is just
the fact that some of them are very hard
to blend and very scratchy and I don't
like spending a ton of time blending my
eyeshadows I just don't so that has been
the fail for the week as far as holy
grails are concerned I have been loving
my white chocolate palette and I do
stand by this I think this one is
definitely the star out of the two and
this is what it looks like I would
recommend this to those of you who do
have a sphere to light complexion it
feels like a medium to deep complexion
this is not gonna show up on you however
they bat chocolate chip pallet wood so
if you don't mind spending the extra
time blending could pick this little guy
up but I do prefer this one it's
beautiful it's got some really nice
pastel like colors in there and it shows
up perfectly on my skin tone so I've
really been enjoying that very beautiful
quality very very nice soft shadows I
also have been loving this new L'Oreal
micellar cleansing water it says it's a
complete cleanser that removes makeup
dirt and oils it also purifies and
mattifies the skin they have three
different versions they have a sensitive
skin version and normal skin version
than a dry skin version and then they
have this one too which is normal to
oily so this is the one that I picked up
I really do like this you get quite a
large amount of product in here 13.5
fluid ounce
for around seven dollars I believe at
the drugstore and I think it's a really
good product if you aren't quite oily I
would recommend checking this one out
because it does not leave any sort of
residual anything on your face so you're
not gonna feel oily you're not gonna
feel like there's something there it's
gonna leave you squeaky clean I will say
I don't love it around my eye area I
noticed that it makes my eyelashes fall
out quite a bit like it is very very
harsh in that area so I would recommend
if you do want to get it for it removing
eye makeup get the sensitive skin
version but this is really nice it just
kind of wiping down your face quickly
especially if you do have combo to oily
skin it gets rid of all the grime and
yucky mess so I have been enjoying that
I also have been enjoying my tuned it
plus fab exfoliating glycolic fix over
night purifying gel and a scrub this is
all i've been using on my face at night
time i go in with the scrub first and
then i've been using the overnight gel
at nighttime and this is a really really
really finely milled scrub but it really
like micro terms the hell out of your
face and the glycolic fixed overnight
gel has 4% glycolic acid in it by the
way this has 3% and this is very sticky
and tacky but it does wonders for my
skin I've had my period this week and I
really haven't had super bad cystic acne
anywhere normally I get like a lot
around my chin and jaw area but only had
one all week so this has been a really
really nice product to try out I also
have been loving a my Becca Jaclyn hill
champagne collection of face palette
this is one of my all-time favorite face
palettes of life it is beautiful I love
the packaging it's just like aesthetic
goals like for sure
beautiful mirror and then you do get two
highlighters in here and three blushes
two of them are kind of like a satiny
matte finish the amaretto shade and also
Pomplamoose and then you have this
little guy right here which is rose a
spritz and that's beautiful beautiful
luminous flush blush so the two
highlighters you are getting are
champagne pop and Prosecco pop I have on
Prosecco pop today I think that these
can still work for you if you do have a
very fair complexion but yeah this is
just a beautiful beautiful palette so
there the there are the two highlighters
this is champagne pop and there is
Prosecco pop I just really really love
this palette I have been in love with it
since I purchased it and if they do
bring it back again for like the third
time then I would highly recommend
checking it out
alright I also have been loving of
course my wife's olive oil
this week they are so beautiful these
are the Philippines and oils in the
shades cherry my chef Lee
I also crush me orange and of course
this one which is called pink me love
pink thing love is mark like a lilac see
purple color crushed me orange is
straight-up orange and then cherry I my
chef Lee is more of like a pinky
watermelon color I love them I feel like
they are quite pigmented for a lip oil
they go on nicely they smell heavenly
they taste really good and they do
moisturize my lips so those have been
great I also have been liking this
little duo here oh just pulled my hair
the L'Oreal infallible Pro glow
foundation in the shade 2:01 ivory
paired together with my Too Faced Born
This Way naturally radiant concealer in
the shade very fair these have a very
similar finish and consistency to them
so they blend very beautifully together
and I've been using a damp sponge to
apply them I think they're great would
highly recommend checking those out
together I also have been loving Am I
Satsuma shower gel from the body shop I
told you guys the scent just makes me
happy and it truly does it's just so
uplifting and wonderful I use it at
night I use it in the morning
I just want to lather my body in this I
will see the actual shower gel I don't
feel like cleans me amazingly well so I
would recommend checking out like their
spray or even their lotion or body cream
before this one but it's still really
nice having enjoying that another a bath
product I have been loving is the
ultimate e peach nectar shower gel
bubble bath and shampoo the part that
I've been loving about this is the smell
again really really nice like kind of
fruity scent I've been really into
fruity scents even though word smack in
the middle of winter basically but yeah
this is the beautiful fruity kind of
scent I said yesterday in my weight not
yesterday Friday in my follow up haul
that doesn't really work that well as
the shampoo bubble bath or shower gel
you guys like it's okay as a shower gel
it's okay it's a bubble bath it doesn't
make the biggest most luxurious bubbles
it doesn't really work as a shampoo but
I just like the overall fragrance and if
you do take a really really quick bath
it's nice because you get to go in and
you get to get out and you don't have
all these residual bubbles all over you
that you have to rinse off so that is
why I personally like it the next item
that have really been enjoying this week
is my why I sell baby doll mascara
I've just been wearing one layer of
mascara this week which is very very
weird for me but it's a really nice
sticky tacky kind of drier formulation
it has my kind
one that I like which is a rubber
bristle wand it is very very flexible as
you guys can see and I love the
packaging so this has been something
that has been really really great and I
definitely will purchase another one
once I run through it and finally the
last item that I have been loving is
from tree hat so this is the bare
moisturizing shave oil you guys this is
the best shaving cream shave oil you
will ever use in your life it is not
oily whatsoever even though it is an oil
it says achieve the closest shave
possible with tree hut shave oil I
believe I got this in my PopSugar
must-have box like three or four months
ago and recently oh I just dropped
my micellar water sorry guys uh-huh but
anyway recently I pulled it back out and
it's just the best thing ever it smells
amazing and it says it helps to improve
the contact between your skin and razor
for a safe shave without Nicks and I
swear I have not gotten a single Nicks
I even so I get wax down there so TMI I
get wax down there and once in a while
if I want to like touch up in between
waxings I'll go ahead and like use a
razor down there but I cannot find a
single like shaving cream or anything
that actually doesn't Nick me down there
except for this so that's kind of
amazing it just sprayed water everywhere
we are a hot mess Express today anyway
that is everything you guys those are
all the products I have been loving and
hating this week for sure let me know
when you have been loving and not liking
it this week and I will see you guys
tomorrow for shot my stash bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
