a my channel I'll go back to my bridles
and how the Greco's where I share with
you guys see products I have been noting
this week and of course the products I
have not been loving let's go ahead and
start with the fail this is actually a
body scrub from the Ulta beauty brand
they recently released these different
kind of scrubs like a seaweed scrub and
they had a brightening scrub as well as
this detoxifying charcoal body scrub it
was a little worried when I first got it
because I'm already not really a fan of
having to clean out my tub or my shower
after I use a body scrub that's super
super gritty but if this guy is not too
gritty actually you don't really feel
like it I really exfoliated my body all
too well what I don't like about this is
that it completely completely up
my tub so as you guys can see it's this
darker gray kind of color and it's just
hella messy I mean if you get a little
bit of this and it dries on the side of
the wall you have all these like dark
splotches all over your bath and it's
just really really annoying it does kind
of smell like a black licorice and lemon
mixed together which again I'm not
really that big of a fan of I hate the
scent of black licorice in fact I hate
black licorice in general but it does
have a hobo oil as well as sweet almond
oil and sesame oil so it does annoy stur
eyes quite nicely but I didn't feel like
it was a very good scrub and I
definitely would not repurchase that now
let's go ahead and get into the holy
grail skies the first one is the by
Lafosse Pro a ride-or-die palette this
is what it looks like on the inside you
have a huge mirror as well as a ton of
ice shadows now I'm just gonna go and
put it in front of my face you can see
everything it's beautiful I can barely
fit it into the frame so to be
completely honest cuz you have so many
shades in here but you have a ton of
finishes in here you haven't done in
different colors so you basically get
whatever you want I've been a little
more experimental with my makeup this
week or whether it be wearing a really
really dark smoky eye or something
that's like really red toned like this
and taking it up really really high kind
of in this area and over in this area
I've been a little more sloppy or messy
with my makeup application but not like
sloppy in a sloppy way it's more
purposeful so I've been trying different
blending techniques and things like that
so I actually really do like this
palette although I do find it incredibly
incredibly overpriced I haven't get a
lot of use out of it this week
another products I've been loving this
week paired together with the
ride-or-die palette
the Urban Decay perversion mascara it
just gives such a nice wet clunky
looking lashes and I feel like when I am
being a little more experimental and I'm
kind of going crazy with the eyeshadow
this is just a really nice pairing now
if you don't like wet formulas and you
don't like natural bristle wands this
isn't not going to be the mascara for
you it does have a little bit of like an
oily slick kind of feel to it and it
does kind of rub off throughout the day
I wish they would come out with a
waterproof version of this I don't think
they have one but I wish they would but
this is just a really great mascara it's
something that really kind of chunks up
my lashes in a nice way and I do enjoy
it alright I also do have a facial
cleanser here that I've been enjoying
this week so I have definitely been
breaking out the past couple of weeks
it's not as bad in this week but this is
the body shops tea tree skin clearing
facial wash I've been using this to wash
my makeup brushes as well as wash on my
face I really do like it I love the
sense of tea tree oil I know a lot of
people don't but I find it incredibly
incredibly soothing for whatever reason
it kind of smells like freshly cut grass
and mint combined if you've never
smelled tea tree oil before it's a very
very strong punch and smell so if you
hate it this is probably not gonna be
the right cleanser for you but I
recently got this little guy 8.4 fluid
ounces of product on the ultra calm
website for eight dollars which was a
steal and this is just really really
nice I do enjoy it and this is the
second time that I have repurchased that
little travel-size there they do also
make a bigger versions of that facial
wash so if you are someone who is very
prone to getting a breakout even if you
do have dry skin that is a nice one to
add into your collection now right here
we have the under eye brightening
corrector from Becca I've been getting a
lot of use out of this this week I
really do like this for my dry skin if I
do have a lot of Blues or just like you
know really really dark colors
underneath my eyes I have been getting
enough sleep I will go ahead and I will
take a little bit of this I warm it up
on my finger I tap it in and then I
blend it in with a damp sponge I feel
like it's really really nice before
going in with concealer and before going
in with foundation and it does give just
a little more brightness to the eye area
and then I do have two different lip
products here as well that I have been
loving this week so the first one is
from colour-pop if this is the
colour-pop lippie stix in me shade could
see it now twisty is beautiful too what
I have on my lips today like I said I've
been
more experimental with my makeup this
week and I have been enjoying appearing
together cool-toned lips with warm eyes
as well as warm tome lips with cool eyes
so this is what the shade Tootsie looks
like I love the way that this Aware's on
my lips personally and I really do like
the colour-pop lippie stix formula and
then here is the cremini a Musa Bush
lipstick from a bite Beauty this is like
a true a weird kind of baby poop kind of
color a lot of people were saying that
they did not like this color on me this
week but I personally really do enjoy it
I have been usually mixing this together
with other and loose boosh lipsticks
however I have just been wearing it by
itself this week I feel like as long as
I'm self tanned it does kind of
complement my skin just a little bit and
again it's a little more of an unusual
color and I've kind of been into that
and then finally guys I have my Becca
luminous flushed blushes in the shades
Camellia as well as foxglove now when
you swatch these side-by-side you really
can't see that much of a difference this
one right here is called camellia which
is like a ballerina pink like baby pink
with a ton of shimmer in it and that fox
Club is gonna look basically the same on
camera but this one has a little more
purpley undertones now because I do pull
a cool undertone I notice immediately a
difference when I get this on to my
cheeks anytime I get inflammation or a
breakout things like that I get more
purpley kind of breakouts or purpley
inflammation rather than like
straight-up redness on my skin like if I
were to look at the redness it's more
purple than red and so for me I find
that anytime I put on some sort of a
purple eyeshadow or a purpley blush
especially on my cheeks it's even more
purple so although these do so watch it
very very similarly in my opinion they
do look different on my cheeks but those
have been the two blushes that I have
been wearing all week so anyway guys
that's it for my fields of holy grails
please let me know down below what are
your top 5 products for the week did you
have any fails I would love to know and
I guess I will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
