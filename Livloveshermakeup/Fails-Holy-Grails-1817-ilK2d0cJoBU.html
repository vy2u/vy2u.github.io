my channel welcome back to my rails and
how to Grails where I share with you
guys the products I have been loving
this week and of course the products I
have not been loving as you can probably
tell from the thumbnail we have a lot of
products that I haven't been loving this
week and before we get into it if you're
wondering what's going on with my outfit
this is Tom's shirt I just put on a cute
necklace so what Abby is like casual
looking but we are going out for date
night tonight so I know I look a little
weird I just haven't put my outfit on
yet so that's why I happy heavier face
makeup on with the with the boyfriend
shirt but anyway let's go ahead and jump
right into it guys the first item that I
have here that was definitely a fail for
the week is from pur cosmetics this is
the 4 in 1 pressed mineral makeup with
broad-spectrum SPF 15 and the shade is
called porcelain so this was actually
sent to me in exchange for an honest
review from pure cosmetics and also octa
Lee it came completely broken like this
as you guys can see which normally that
wouldn't really bother me but what
bothered me was the fact that mr. badger
actually got into this so because it
didn't have a lid on it he was able to
jump into this product and scrape it up
which is a little too bad but before he
scraped it up I did get to try this out
I really don't like this product it is
extremely extremely yellow toned very
very flaky and dry looking on my skin it
doesn't feel very soft to the touch even
before he put his claws in there so this
was not something that I liked at all I
would not recommend and I really liked
octa Lee because you can give your
honest opinion and in my honest opinion
is that this sucks so did not like that
I also did not really like it this
little guy here this is new from the
drugstore this is the Maybelline Color
tattoo eye chrome it's been out a little
longer than some of the other products
that I picked up for my what's new at
the drugstore video next week but the
shade is called 500 gilded rose and I
used this yesterday in my look of the
week video it looks very very pretty
when you do tap it onto like your lid
but it really creases on me and even the
Maybelline Color tattoos in general
creased on me so I kind of decluttered
all of those so this is not something
that I would recommend if you do have
more like drier eyelids and my eyelids
used to be extremely oily now they're
very very dry and this is just not
something that I think is that great it
does last all day and will give it that
but it definitely creases on me so I
don't like that I also have not been
liking these two new covergirl brow
products that I picked up again you will
see these when I do my what
new at the drugstore video this is the
easy breezy brow shape and defined a
brow gel this is just really really
weird it goes on super super white and
it kind of leaves like a strange white
cast on your eyebrow so I don't like
that I prefer like my Milani brow
shaping wax and then this is the
covergirl what is this called brow plus
liner powder this is extremely dark even
though it is the shade of blonde it just
makes my eye like my eyebrows look
really really weird so today I didn't
use any of the products I'm talking
about I did more like date night makeup
so I'm not using any of these products
but you probably saw me wearing this
this week and it looks strange
it makes my eyebrows look really really
dark and just not that great so did not
like that either alright let's go ahead
and talk about the holy grails for the
week the first one is from the brand of
rituals I actually got this any glossy
box probably about 4 or 5 months ago
this is the gingko Secret ginseng and
gingko biloba Karin hand bomb so I've
been dealing with extremely dry skin
especially around my wrist area this has
been pretty much like hearing that it's
been really really amazing I absolutely
love it the only thing I don't like is
the scent so it has a really like
strange perfume II kind of scent to it
like a natural perfume he sent I don't
really know how to describe it but it's
not my cup of tea and also I feel like
when you are dealing with severely
severely dry skin you should probably
stay away from products that do have
fragrance in it because that will just
further the irritation that you already
have so this is something that I have
been enjoying just don't really love the
scent I also have been loving up my NYX
color correcting concealer palette again
used this yesterday in look of the week
I've hit pan on pretty much every single
shade in this palette it is well loved
and this is definitely something I would
repurchase when I do finish it up I like
it because it they're very very creamy
they never look dry on the skin and
they're beautiful and you can put your
foundation on top of this without the
colors actually peeking through the only
one that I don't trust all that often is
the green shade this sometimes will peak
through a foundation especially if
you're wearing like a water-based
foundation like I did this week so just
be careful with that one but overall
really really beautiful would highly
recommend that if you don't want to pick
up like the urban decay Cutler
correcting fluids moving on like I said
I have been loving a serum foundation if
you think my nose anyway I have been
living a serum or water foundation this
week this is the Stila aqua glow serum
foundation this is the first year I'm
foundation I ever tried out I have a
review on my channel the shade that I do
wear is called fair it's B
on the skin very very hydrating if you
do want a nice kind of hydrating
foundation I would highly recommend
checking this out you can probably see
yesterday and look at the week as I was
pulling putting it on pulling it on as I
was putting it on it gives just a
beautiful beautiful natural glow to the
skin so this is something that I would
recommend for those of you who do have
dry skin it's beautiful and they do have
a decent shade selection so anyway have
been enjoying that I also have been
loving my ELF lip balm tinted this is
what it looks like I have two different
shades this particular one is called
berry it just gives a really really nice
tinge to your lips I'm not someone who's
really that crazy into lip products
anymore I used to really like full on
color and now I'm just kind of like oh I
like more natural looking colors so this
is what it looks like it has a jelly
sort of consistency to it very very
moisturizing easy to put on it tastes
good these are awesome very very much
like an underrated product so I would
highly recommend checking those out I
also have been loving my two Korres oils
so the first one I have here is the wild
rose vitamin C active brightening oil
which I purchased probably about a year
ago on the Sephora calm website it's
taking me forever to get through this
and then this one is the karez black
pine active firming sleeping oil this
one was actually sent to me from
octillion Korres as well in exchange for
an honest review so I have been liking
both of these I prefer the rose oil a
lot because or much more I should say
because I do like rose I'm a big fan of
rose I feel like it is brightening it's
very soothing on the skin I never feel
like I get extra irritation from this
whereas this guy over here does have a
strong scent to it now it's more like a
layering oil you can put this on top of
any sort of moisturizer and layer it
nicely this one I like to mix into
foundations I like to mix into actual
moisturizers I feel like I get more
moisture from this but if you are more
combination to oily skin I would
recommend the black pine of firming
sleeping oil it's really beautiful like
I said you can put on your nighttime
moisturizer and then put that on top for
just a little bit of extra firm this and
just hydration to your skin but the one
that I would recommend the most is the
rose oil alright I also have been loving
at the hard-candy baked bronzer in the
shade tiki this is what it looks like I
know not everybody was into my more like
warm toned cheek look this week but this
is basically what gave me that really
really warm toned look so it's beautiful
I really like the way it goes onto the
skin I like that opalescent not
opalescent it's like a yellowy golden
color it just looks amazing
the cheeks if you do have a very fair
complexion like I do this is great as an
actual blush topper so I've been
enjoying that a lot I also have been
loving my bike beauty agave lip mask
I've been having some like psoriasis on
the outside of my lips and this has been
practically the only thing that has been
kind of saving me so this is an amazing
product it is vegan it's cruelty free it
is food grade you literally can eat buy
beauty products so I think that's
awesome I mean I'm not saying you should
but it does taste good if you get it
into your mouth I also have been
enjoying the covergirl so lashing at
mascara this is in the blackest of black
shades I think it's called like yeah no
I'm sorry extreme black is the shade but
this is really really interesting I love
what it does for my upper lashes you
guys I think it's awesome I really like
this part of the wand but the little
ball part at the bottom is just a little
too big and when you're trying to get to
your bottom lashes like I have poked my
eye so many times this week using this
little blonde so it's not necessarily
something I would repurchase and I don't
know it's covergirl cruelty-free someone
let me know down below I feel like maybe
they're not so I wouldn't repurchase it
anyway if they are cruelty I mean if
they aren't cruelty free but yeah I
don't know I just feel like this gives
nice definition to the upper lashes but
for the bottom lashes you're gonna need
to go in with something different if
you're someone who likes to put your
mascara on really quickly which I deal
alright I also have been enjoyed my alba
botanica good and clean fruit acid detox
fusion this is a pore purifying mini
peel this is an oil free gel it does
have let's see here a 6% of alpha
hydroxy acids in it this is really nice
I've been using this kind of as like my
face mask this Yod this week so it
doesn't have any parabens fat elates or
synthetic fragrances it is a hundred
percent vegetarian ingredients and if
you didn't know alba botanica is cruelty
free so this is a really really nice
kind of thing it's non comedogenic
hypoallergenic dermatologist tested if
you want a peel but you don't want like
the Peter Thomas Roth peel pads where
it's like an extreme amount of acids
this is really nice I feel like this
would work for those of you who do have
sensitive skin who want to get off that
top layer of dead skin you're supposed
to leave it on from 1 to 6 minutes
depending on your skin type after about
3 minutes I have to wash it off because
I really feel like I'm getting bread in
the face and a little tingly but it's
beautiful I feel like it takes off that
top layer of dead skin and I just like
what it does for my overall complexion I
also have been loving the origins
ginseng refreshing eye cream so last
week
in my fields in a Holy Grails video
travel edition I talked about how I did
not like the facial mist or the scrub
cleanser I got four different products
from the ginseng line in a little kit
that I bought on Sephora in the sale
section so we have the ginseng eye cream
we have the moisturizer and then those
two other products which I said I didn't
like last week I like this one and I
like the moisturizer but if there's one
thing that I would recommend from the
ginseng line from the collection it is
this guy right here this is the
refreshing and you know refreshing eye
cream that brightens and deposits the
skin so I really like it I think it's
beautiful it's not something you want to
use at nighttime because it really does
have a little bit of a sheen in it and
it's just meant to kind of brighten up
your skin but what I like to do is
actually take it all the way down and do
like a triangle and I just feel like it
gives an overall nice appearance to my
skin so I have been enjoying that quite
a bit and the last item that I have been
loving is my pur cosmetics buff
collection eyeshadow palette this I got
in at my glossy but I'm sorry No my
boxycharm last month it is really
beautiful I used this yesterday in the
look of the week I've been wearing a lot
of like pinky tone to I looks and my
favorite shade in here is Mojave I can't
believe I said mo Jobbik yesterday in
the video it's so funny because it's the
Mojave or Mojave Desert which is like
located in I believe Nevada and
California I think I've actually been
there and yet I still said mo choppy so
anyway that is my favorite shade in the
palette is just a beautiful beautiful
kind of rosy shade or right there as you
guys can see I also really like the
shade desert sand dust they're all
really really gorgeous Mirage is
beautiful as well they're very very nice
very very pigmented I love the way they
go on the eyes very blendable the only
thing I don't like is that they are kind
of powdery but I prefer this over the
naked 3 so anyway guys that is it for my
fails in holy grails I hope this video
was helpful I hope you enjoyed it thank
you so much for joining me and I'll see
you guys tomorrow for shot my stuff bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
