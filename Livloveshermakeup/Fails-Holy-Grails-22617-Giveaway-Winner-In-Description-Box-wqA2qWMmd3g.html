welcome back to my files in hella Grails
where I share with you guys the products
I have been loving this week and of
course see products I have not been
loving we are going to start with the
little for the week this is the
fail it is from Maybelline and it is
called the dream brightening creamy
concealer this is a real little piece of
 to me okay the shade that I where
is number 10 fair apparently this is the
lightest that skin colors go ah
according to maybelline but this is what
it looks like it is just one of those
little crayon concealers I do have a
swatch on the back of my hand right here
to show you guys I feel like my arms
look a lot tanner than my face right now
I don't know why I feel like I have like
the rest of the channel my body from
Hawaii but my face tan is gone but
anyway here is the swatch as you guys
can see it goes on quite nicely I
actually think it looks quite pretty a
kind of like that has a little bit of a
yellow or salmon e undertone to help
conceal blue tones underneath the eyes
but this looks horrible underneath my
eyes if I blend it in with a sponge it
looks horrible a brush it looks horrible
everything looks horrible ok so for
Bieber sleeve is just really really
clogging to dry patches even areas where
I tried to spot conceal it did not work
for me if you are really really oily I
do think it would work for you but if
you're a dry combo normal skin I would
stay away all right now let's go ahead
and get into the holy grails the first
one is actually a moisturizing body
lotion this actually reminds me a lot of
like a moisturizing body gel this is
from the ulta beauty collection the ulta
beauty collection is cruelty free which
is awesome this is the nectarine rose
moisturizing body lotion it does claim
to have shea butter aloe vitamins A B 5
C and E I don't think it's all that
moisturizing but I just love the scent
of it you guys it is absolutely
beautiful if you really like that tennis
tennis of nectarine I think you would
really enjoy this and then also the
sweetness of Rose now I only wear this
in the morning because Tom claims that
it makes him give them a headache like
it's a very very strong kind of
overpowering scent but for me I'm all
about that life I love it you guys know
I love everything rose and i like that
it does have that cooling effect it's
been helping with my leftover sunburn on
my back and on my shoulders so I really
been enjoying that I also have been
absolutely loving my Too Faced
semi-sweet chocolate bar palette this is
my all-time favorite chocolate bar
palette that they have ever released it
has a lot of warm tone shades in here
and I are basically just been wearing
warm tone smokey eyes the whole entire
week some of them were a little more
defined and some of them were more
subtle but this is just beautiful it's a
very very everyday work friendly I'm a
teacher if you guys didn't know
teach music and this is great for work
it's also just great for going out you
really can do everything with this
palette so you have lots of warm tones
over here my favorite shades are
definitely butter pecan bonbon and
caramel I love the shade peanut butter
as well and the nougat is great as a
transition but then you do have some
cooler tones over here so if you do want
to go ahead and work those into the
outer V or on the lower lash line you
can kind of smoke it out a little bit
and get a really nice night look so love
this palette it smells amazing I just
wish the two phase could be a little
more consistent and release more pallets
like this alright moving on the next
item that I have been loving is my
makeup geek kathleenlights highlighting
palette now if you guys saw my initial
initial name initial review on this you
would know that I wasn't really that in
love with it I feel like I was not using
the right brushes so all of you have
been asking me how am I getting this
glow on my cheeks this week it is this
highlighting palette it's not so much
the blushes I'll show you guys those in
a second it is this particular shape
right here this is the one that I've
really really been using and I've also
been using this one so this is the
makeup geek kathleenlights highlighting
palette the shade in the middle is
called starlight and then this one is
called night light this one right here
is called sunlight haven't been using
sunlight as much because this is
definitely darker than my particular
skin tone but I really really really
love this metal shade you guys this one
is just beautiful starlight is kind of
like a silvery lilac color and then you
do have a night light which is that more
like warm toned gold now when I swatch
them you guys can see they're pretty
darn sheer so what I've been doing is
actually picking these up with my Sigma
f-35 tapered highlighting brush I'd go
right in I do not tap off any excess and
I just put it onto my cheekbones a lot
of you have been saying it's overkill I
don't know I feel like I am just like a
beacon of light for the astronauts in
space that's what my friend meg says all
the time I love it I really really think
it's a beautiful glow it's different for
me I just wanted to try something fun
and different this week I've really been
liking it so yeah that has been this
particular palette just don't tap off
the excess just put it right on it and
then kind of blend it in circular
motions so it looks more skin like but
yeah that is just how i've been getting
this glow and I really really have been
enjoying it and then a lot of you have
been curious about the blush this week
that I've been using this week as well
so this week this week this week it is
the lorac unzipped cheek palette they
are bringing this back it does retail
for $25 I think they're bringing it back
in the summertime so at the top you do
have two different matte shades
underrated is a butyl
beautiful neutral kind of pinky color
perfect for an everyday look and then
you have unashamed to this one I was
wearing with the nightlight highlight
the other day and a lot of you were like
I love that cheek combo and then
unapologetic is like a dupe for max son
Basque really really gorgeous and then
unimaginable is also really really
stunning so that is what they look like
today I am wearing a different blush I
did my makeup in a little bit of a hurry
so I'm wearing the what was it holiday
2016 a palette from our glass but these
are beautiful really highly recommend
checking these out especially picking it
up when it comes back in stock so been
loving that I also have been doing
something a little different this week I
have been baking my face I never thought
that I would be the kind of person to
bake my face because I just I I just
can't be bothered but I have been baking
and I've been using the translucent
locket powder and this is from kat von d
i really really like baking you guys I'm
gonna be doing a hacks video for you
guys talking about hacks to actually
work on half of my face I'm going to be
doing the hacks and then on the other
side i'm not so you guys can see the
kind of hacks that I like to use like
you know putting oil into your
foundation baking doing a different kind
of things about is getting everywhere
but I have a bunch of different things
that I've really been enjoying their
kind of like makeup hack so I'm gonna be
doing that video for you guys but yeah
I've been baking I just take a damp
sponge a kind of tap in there and put it
underneath my eye and then right here i
have smile lines mostly probably because
i'm a fluted that also i smile a lot so
I like to bake around this area I feel
like it really really seals in those
fine lines and wrinkles and also just
helps who don't get as oily throughout
the day so been loving that I feel like
baking is like a real thing I mean I
always knew it's a real thing it was
just like do I really want to try that
and now I'm really happy that I did
alright the next item I have been loving
is from milk makeup this is the cooling
water stick I know everybody is
obsessed with excuse my language but
 obsessed with that blurring
stick everybody's been talking about
lately I don't know it looks like that
what's a little gimmicky to me but I do
love this this is really really nice now
you can get something very very similar
elf makes like a moisture stick that I
think is basically the same exact thing
but this is basically just a moister
stick that you can rub onto your face it
has a little bit of tackiness so I find
it is absolutely perfect for going ahead
and just like I don't know using as a
base because it does have that little
bit of tackiness so it really adheres
your foundation so yeah I've been liking
that a lot it's also nice for going
underneath the eye area too
cloud any sort of puffiness that you may
have in your skin in the morning alright
next i have been loving my revlon
colorstay brow pencil in D shade blonde
now I feel like I've been talking about
this for weeks and weeks and weeks now
and shot my stash but I have been doing
my rounds a little differently this week
today I actually didn't do anything
really different I just filled in the
front part of my brow the rest of the my
brow that you guys see is just my
natural brow but this week for the most
part I have been over filling my brows
again I'm just trying to do things a
little differently I feel like I have
all of this makeup in my collection and
I'm like why don't you do something
different once in a while you know I had
kind of fallen into the trend of just
doing what I'm comfortable with and it's
not so much because I don't want to wear
like a bold brow or like a bold
highlight it's just that I don't like to
spend a lot of time doing my makeup but
I've been taking that extra time this
week and a lot of you have been
complimenting me on my makeup so I
appreciate it but yeah I spoolie out my
brows and then I start to fill them in
from the top and I will go ahead when I
do look at the week next saturday i will
show you guys how I've been doing that
but yeah that is the revlon brow pencil
in the shade blonde i also have been
loving this de right shampoo so i am
wearing it today or an happen in my hair
i have not washed my hair in four days I
know I'm disgusting it's not really
don't want to I just have been so
incredibly busy but this is great I do
you think even if you have dark hair
this would work for you i was using this
when we were on vacation as well I just
sprayed around my hairline where I get
the most oily I leave it for like two to
three minutes and then I really really
kind of massage it in and it just takes
care of the oil it really kind of looks
like you just washed your hair I feel
like four days is a little a little too
much but like after two days you can use
this and it looks like you just washed
your hair which is great all right I
have been layering mascaras this week a
lot of you have been asking a how i
layer mascara i literally just put one
on and then I put the other I try and I
always go in with the second one before
the first one drives so what I've been
doing this week is using the Lancome
Hypnose drama is my first layer this is
a beautiful wet mascara and that I've
been going in with a dry mascara this is
1 i'm not in love with it is the
superhero mascara from it cosmetics I
find this flakes almost as bad as like
the two-phase better than sex mascara on
me personally so paired together with a
wet mascara actually really really helps
so after this after i put this on I go
immediately in with this and I find that
it doesn't flake as much throughout the
day I think it's a beautiful beautiful
combination really makes the
just look nice and full so really been
loving the two of those together oh so
also have been loving the soap &amp;amp; Glory
face soap and clarity vitamin C facial
wash it has a yuzu in it which i think
is like an orange it's some sort of like
fruit that is the vitamin C that you get
in here this is just wonderful you guys
it makes me feel squeaky clean and
sometimes I just want to feel squeaky
clean so I've been using this in the
morning I also i've been using it at
night yeah it really doesn't smell that
good it smells kind of like a chemical
chemical like orange you know what's not
like a chemical orange guys and a little
bit of mint eNOS it doesn't smell great
but it makes me feel very very fresh and
clean so I've been enjoying that it's a
facial wash would not recommend if you
do have dry skin it's going to strip
your skin but if you do have combo or
oily or normal scam you would like it i
also have been loving the Maybelline
Dream cushion fresh-faced liquid
foundation on the go i hate to recommend
this since maybelline obviously tests on
animals but this is a beautiful
foundation and i know a lot of you have
been giving me a little bit of flap or
slack for talking about products or kind
of like telling you guys if a product is
good even if it's not cruelty free but
the thing is is that a lot of you are
not cruelty free and i'm not gonna lie
to you guys and say oh I hate it just
because I want you to go cruelty-free I
will always tell you guys um when I
really like a product and if its cruelty
free or not but this particular one is
not there have been a few products that
I've shown in this video that are not
but I just want to put it out there i'm
not an extremist I'm never gonna push
something on my channel I'm never gonna
try make you something that is something
that you have to decide for yourself
just because I'm cruelty-free does not
mean I am going to be trying to push
other people to do it if they want to
that's great but this is the beautiful
foundation I'm not just gonna pretend
that it's not just because it's not
cruelty free anyway long a lot of the
longueville ranch but this is what the
actual foundation looks like again at
maybelline seems to think that this is
the lightest that skin goes this machine
is called porcelain it is too dark for
me but I will reserve this for the
summertime it is cruelty free so i won't
repurchase but it is probably the best
cushion foundation that i have found so
far so I really have been enjoying that
I also have been enjoying the glam glow
thirsty mad again Glanville does test on
animals but this is a beautiful
beautiful hydrating treatment really
nice if you do have dry skin I'm going
to enjoy every little drop of this and I
do hope that they eventually go
cruelty-free it looks like they are
actually in the works of going
cruelty-free which is awesome all right
and the last product I really have been
loving this week you guys is from NYX
Cosmetics it is the slide on glide on
stay on and definitely a turn on
eyeliner in the shade of bronze this is
so freaking beautiful i was about to
drop the f-bomb again i'm sorry it is so
freaking beautiful you guys it just has
this gorgeous gorgeous sheen to it and a
little bit of like a reddish undertone
if you have blue eyes you need this it
is absolutely stunning on the waterline
smudged out on the lower lash line if
you can do winged that's awesome you
should do it with this yeah I just
really really enjoy it I feel like it
does have the where power and thus where
time where time staying power yeah we're
time and staying power of the Urban
Decay 24-7 glide on eye pencils so
anyway guys those are the products that
I have been loving this week and of
course hating this week I hope that you
enjoyed this video definitely let me
know down below what your weekly
favorites and feels have been and I will
see you guys tomorrow for shot my stash
