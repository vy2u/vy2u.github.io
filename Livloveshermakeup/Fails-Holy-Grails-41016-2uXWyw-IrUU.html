and how the rails this is my weekly
favorites on Sundays this is the video I
do every Sunday where I share with you
guys the products that I loving and the
products that i am not loving yeah the
products I really don't like that our
total fails so let's go ahead and get
started with the fails there is just one
this week it is this a vmail active
naturals clear complexion these are
daily cleansing pads with point five
percent salicylic acid in them they are
supposed to help prove a break out and
gently exfoliates for clear I was going
to say younger looking skin even looking
skin with soy extract so the reason I
picked these up was because I thought
they were going to be similar to the
rock resurfacing discs which I'm
obsessed with I am obsessed with I use
those as the second step in like my
makeup removal at nighttime and I'll run
a pad over my face and then rinse with
water I thought these would be similar
they are cheaper that's why I picked
them up they are not because they have
that salsa lick acid in there they
really make my skin feel very very tight
and then on top of that I just feel like
the pads are not as nice they are dual
textured just like the rock one so you
have a soft side and then like a crispy
your side or an exfoliating side um but
i swear to god i feel like i've been
using these for ever and i still have
like 10 left i'm so disappointed oh you
do get let's see here 28 3 point 25
inches self-folding dual texture pads
and I can't believe 28 I feel like I
should have been done with these a
really long time ago do you ever have
that product in your collection or
you're like how are you not empty okay
like that is how I feel about these
cleansing pads so yeah I'm just not a
huge fan they definitely would probably
work as like a cleanser in the morning
but what I like to use these for again
is to remove my makeup at night time
after I go in with like an oil or
something like that and they're just not
good they're just not good at that they
do smell really nice but I just I'm not
a fan alright moving on let's talk about
some things that I have been loving this
week the first is this bath and body
works deep cleansing hand soap this is
the wild honeysuckle sent you guys oh I
love this and i love the lilac blossom
sense that they come out with during the
springtime i just love the smell of
honeysuckle and
and this is a beautiful blend of fresh
honeysuckle free shaft freixa friscia
friscia frische freesia and white blood
anyway I really really enjoyed this
scent I think it really really smells
amazing and I love the deep cleansing
hand soaps I feel like they really help
get all the gunk and grind off of my
hands alright what else have I been
loving I've been loving these blushes
this week and it's so buddy these are
the little toothpaste 16 hour of the
16-hour yeah long-lasting 16-hour
blushes I have five of the six shades I
am waiting on the one shade called baby
love to be like not sold out anymore at
sephora i didn't even get my hands on it
during the vib sale which i'm so pissed
about but i am waiting on that last one
it's constantly sold out but i really
really love these blushes i have every
single shade except for baby love like i
said this one is i will always love you
which is kind of like a Mutie peach
color and then the one I'm wearing today
is your love is king which is a
beautiful berry and if you put it on
with like a light hand gorgeous like
flush to your skin and then I have love
hangover which is like a warm tone sort
of like watermelon color and then I have
justify my love which is a beautiful set
sort of like um I don't know cool pink
cool tone pink with a little bit of
silver shimmer and then the last one is
called how deep is your love which is
like a hot coral shade so I really
really love these I just feel like I
don't know I just feel like I should
have baby love I feel like I shouldn't
show those unless I have baby love I
heard baby love is like the best one out
of all of them too and of course that's
one that's how we sold out so that's
kind of depressing but it is what it is
all right moving on the next thing I've
been loving is my morphe of Jacqueline
he'll collaboration palette this week
I've been wearing this on my eyes I
really like the colors in here they're
really really nice lots of warm tones my
favorite shade is definitely this orange
one right here like yeah yes yes yes
love that really really beautiful and
yeah I've just been having a fun time
playing with all of these colors this
week really enjoy that I do think morphy
has good quality products there's that
orange once watched by the way it almost
goes on like a foil I shadow but i'm
going to leave a video down in the
description bar like a link to a video
on the morphe brands that a girl here on
youtube did it's very very interesting
and very educational I'm the linked up
below
you guys should go watch it alright the
next thing I have been loving let's talk
about a little bit of skincare the
benefit puff off this is like a little
eye cream that comes with this cooling
tip applicator and if you'll say good
when you're like rubbing it on your skin
it feels amazing it definitely helps
with puffiness and how they like pig
sort of color to it that's a little bit
like your ad S&amp;amp;C that's not a word
iridescent see I'm making it a word yeah
all right it's a really really beautiful
though I really love it I feel like it
really brightens my eyes up and it
definitely helps with puffiness for
lipsticks this week I've been wearing
these two wet and wild lipstick these
are in 903 see just peachy which looks
like this let me go ahead and swatch it
for you guys these were such an
incredibly long time you do need to go
ahead and like moisturize your lips
before you put them on because they can
be a little drying but they wear forever
and then the one the other one is called
purty persimmon and that one is right
there so we have pretty persimmon which
is the one I have on my lips today and
then this one is just peachy really
really beautiful very opaque they last
literally all day I only have to like
reapply maybe once a day maybe like they
last forever really really enjoy those
four primers this week I've been loving
my wet'n'wild coverall primer for my
face I really really enjoyed this primer
I don't feel like a lot of people talk
about this it's not going to fill in
your pores or fine lines it doesn't have
a genetic own sort of feel to it all
it's going to do is prolonged where of
your makeup and I have been working
really really long hours and to like you
know the late night time hours this week
so this has been really really helpful
it really does keep my foundation and my
makeup staying like on my face all day
looking really good so I've enjoyed this
quite a bit and then as far as I primers
go I've been loving my Too Faced shadow
insurance glitter glue primer it's just
one of my all-time favorites you can do
it with the elf glitter glue primer that
was also very good but I just have this
little one and I'd be quite a dent he's
about Eddie as far as eyeliners go this
week I've been doing kind of like brown
or coppery ice I guess like on my
waterline so this one is from Nexus is a
slide on glide on stay on and definitely
a turn on eyeliner in
el 16 golden bronze which looks like
this this is such a beautiful color if
you don't have this you need it like I'm
sorry but none of the Urban Decay 24-7
glide on eye pencils like mimic this
sort of color it's beautiful on the
waterline especially if you have blue
eyes and also these smashbox always
sharp waterproof kohl eyeliner in the
shade sumatra love this a lot like a
really really beautiful just super super
deep dark cool toned chocolatey brown
color there it is so really really been
enjoying those on the waterline in the
tight line as far as mascara is
concerned i've been using this little
clinique this little sample size of the
bottom lash mascara which we really do
like it's basically like the maybelline
lash discovery yeah i would say the
maybelline lash discovery is definitely
a dupe for this it has a really tiny
little mini wand easy to really get into
like those base lashes and also be lower
lashes and then i have been topping that
with my covergirl this super sizer which
is just my favorite drugstore mascara i
love the wand on this thing is totally
twisted and weird looking but it really
really gets in there and pulls the
lashes up it's absolutely beautiful I
absolutely absolutely absolutely adore
that can I say absolutely any more
absolutely alright moving on I have been
loving this tata indigo susan triple
recovery cream in the morning and then
i've been putting on this bobby brown
extra face oil on top so these are
basically just my moisturizers so the
tata indigo cream looks like this it
actually has a purpley blue tone to it
so if you have rosacea or sunburn or
redness this will actually like counter
ass to the redness in your face it's
really really cool it's basically like a
color correcting face cream really
really enjoy it I don't love the scent
on it kind of smells like rice bran oil
or like rice or something not that I
don't like rice I love eating rice but i
don't really like the small wood on my
face oh so yeah it's really really nice
though it really has a soothing sort of
quality to it i don't feel like i have a
lot of redness in my skin after I apply
it and it moisturizes very nicely it has
a beautiful texture to it as well and
then I have been applying about four to
five drops of this Bobby Brown extra
face oil on top and this smells amazing
this smells like um what is the aveda
products like really really just
gorgeous like woodsy sort of like
aromatherapy sort of
I love this if you have sensitive skin
this set actually might irritate your
skin a little bit but I really like this
it does put a little bit of extra
moisture into my skin and I just pack
that in on top of the taja cream alright
for foundation this week I have been
wearing my Laura Geller baked liquid
radiance foundation which I really enjoy
in the shade porcelain it does pull a
very strong yellow undertone I am cool
undertone so I just kind of counteract
it with like a lighter powder but I
really do enjoy this it gives your skin
a very radiant beautiful glow and then
if you set it in with powder it just
makes it look completely like math and
poreless and beautiful so I really
really do enjoy this a lot and then for
dry shampoo this week I've been loving
this the true original dry shampoo this
one is Ben fruity floral like God knows
Kassim you guys really really smells
good like really really smells good
loving this it does leave a little bit
of a white cast in my hair as you can
probably tell but I don't really mind I
don't really care if people think I have
white or gray hair so I really just like
it because it sucks up all the oil I'm
on like three days without watching my
hair which is unheard of for my greasy a
scalp uh I really do enjoy this I love
the scent on it alright moving on for
highlighter this week a lot of you have
been asking what I've been wearing and
it is this it is the new Urban Decay
afterglow eight-hour powder highlighter
in the shade aura and it's so funny I
just picked up one of these in the shade
sin for you guys for the 7000 subscriber
giveaway by the way that's coming soon I
have a few items that I'm still waiting
on but anyway this is the after glow
powder highlighter in the shade aura
which is a beautiful iridescent pinky
purple shade and it looks just so
stunning on the cheeks it doesn't really
pair that well with warm colors i feel
like i've been wearing a lot of warmth
on my lips and my eyes and I thought
sometimes it looked a little strange
when I was watching back to my videos
this week but I still think it's
absolutely stunning if you were to wear
this was like a cool toned I look like
that would be gorgeous and I'm trying to
make a dent in this ok I really really
enjoyed that by the way it's one of
those kind of like baked chill a sort of
formulas not completely big to lay but
it's a little it's got a little bit of
grip to it so i highly recommend getting
a really dense brush and buffing it into
your skin
or also will look like it's just sitting
on top of your skin all right for toner
this week I've been loving my Neutrogena
oil-free acne stress control
triple-action toner with 2% salicylic
acid I use this a week before my period
during my period and week after my
period because that is one I deal with
texture and lots of break out some
things like that and this just clears it
up right away I only use this at
nighttime I don't wear it during the day
it doesn't irritate my skin a little bit
but it gets rid of all the clogged pores
and disgustingness alright moving on I
have been loving this body washing no
I've talked about this before oh such a
note gasm like so much so much doge
album okay it just smells so good this
is the correct passionate spell fine
fragrance elixirs passion fruit and
fiery orange rose body wash this is
heavily heavily sentence sentence
scented and very very fragrant highly
fragrance that's what i should say i
really really enjoy it it just fills up
the whole like room like your whole
bathroom will smell like this and at
first I was like why are you wanting to
use this Olivia like this is in a very
spring scent but it kind of is I mean
it's passion fruit and fiery orange rose
but it has like a mix of like sandalwood
or something in there so it makes it
kind of like a musky scent it's really
beautiful i highly recommend checking
this out seriously it smells so good and
I got no idea you could use that you
could also use it as a bubble bath so I
did that a few times this week but for
the most part i was using this baby
right here for my bubble bath I think I
talked about this literally like last
week or the week before this is the bath
and Bodyworks japanese cherry blossom
bubble bath and i've been loving this
because this is the time of year where
all the cherry blossom trees are
blossoming and when I lived in New York
every single year the first week of
April or the last week of March I forget
when they bloom but the first week of
April or the last week of march i would
go to the brooklyn botanical gardens and
see all the cherry blossom trees so this
has just kind of been like a reminder of
that I don't know that was always a lot
of fun so I really really have been
enjoying this this week and let's talk
about like breakouts on the chest and
back area can you tell like why I'm
wearing like a shirt that like wraps up
my neck today uh I never using this shea
moisture african black soap problem skin
facial wash and scrub this has cameroon
extra and tea tree oil in it so it helps
to clear and balance blemished oily skin
i normally use this on my face however
i've started you
my body it's leaking all over it's so
disgusting the so gross so gross but
anyway I have been using this on like my
neck and my chest and my back because
this is the time of year where I start
to get pimples on my chest on my back I
don't know if you guys get those I do
especially during the warmer months so
this has been combating that problem
really really enjoyed this a lot and
then I have a hair mask that I have been
loving this is the new garden a whole
blends I am loving this line I mean I've
only tried to products to deep
conditioners this one is the avocado and
shea butter and then the other one is I
believe royal jelly love that one love
this one another nose gasm smelled
amazing very comforting scent it's like
baby like a baseball like a bit it's not
like baby powder or something like that
mixed with like perfume very comforting
scent really like that a lot um but
anyway I have been using this and I just
feel like my hair has been looking
really good I mean today it's not
because again there's like tons of dry
shampoo in there whatnot but for the
most part this makes my hair so
manageable when I get out of the shower
and that's a huge thing to me I very
long tangley hair so I need that I
really really need that and this
definitely give that to me so I've been
enjoying that and then the last and
final products I want to talk about is
that it I feel like they didn't have
that much this week interesting I
normally have like 20 minutes worth of
stuff to show you guys but anyway this
is the last item this is the redken
frist dismiss sulfate free shampoo
that's what did not come out right frist
dismiss sulfate free shampoo this is
like the best like foaming sulfate free
shampoo I've ever used in my life
honestly I normally don't go for soft
big three shampoos because they don't
lather you know when you see those
commercials like the herbal essences
commercial where she has like a whole
pile of foam like on her head she's
lathering that's what I want that's what
I strive for okay this does not really
do that but it still foams up really
nicely which surprises me I do like that
it's all fate free because I know that
that's better it doesn't strip the color
from your hair if you do diet but I will
say I feel like sometimes it wastes my
hair down a tiny bit but I feel like
also help me with frizz so I do like it
I can get the good product and it does
help it like humidity protection and
stuff like that so I'm sure I'm going to
be reaching for this a lot during the
summer alright guys that is my friends
and fellow rails for the week I hope you
guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for joining me and I will see you
guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
