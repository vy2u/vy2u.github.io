channel Oh welcome back to my files in
how to grow where I share with you guys
new products I have been loving this
week and of course the products I have
not been loving let's go ahead and start
with the fail there is only one and this
was sent to me for PR it is from pure
cosmetics it is a bear at all 12-hour
four and one skin perfecting a
foundation and the only reason why I
really don't like this well first of all
it feels very heavy on the skin it's
really only a foundation that I would
personally wear when I'm on stage
because I don't think it's a very
everyday friendly I like something a
little lighter but second of all this
has absolutely no wear time whatsoever I
did go ahead and try it out with three
different primers this week a makeup
extender the Beca first light priming
filter and also the Smashbox
photo-finish which is a silicone based
primer and I just cannot get this to
where it will a long time on my skin so
please let me know down below if you
arrive any recommendations on how I can
get this to wear a little longer
throughout the day but yeah overall it
just wears very very poorly it starts to
really gather around my nose pores it
gets a very dry in this area which
normally I'm very oily there but then I
also do get oily around my nose and my
chin it just kind of makes me look like
a complete mess at the end of the day so
unfortunately this just did not work for
me I did go ahead and apply it with an
oval brush and I think that works a lot
better and then I damp sponge or any
sort of buffing brush like a lot of you
recommended but I just can't get it to
wear on my skin so that is definitely a
fail for the week let's go ahead and get
into a holograph now shall we the first
one is from Mario Badescu it is the
facial spray with aloe herbs and
rosewater I love this facial mess and I
really like I feel like when I'm not
using this I forget how much I love it
and then I purchase it again and I'm
like I love it I love the smell of it it
kind of smells like a chlorinated pool
what's like a little bit of like rose
water in it I don't even know how to
describe it but it smells really really
good it feels nice on the skin I do
truly truly feel like it does moisturize
my skin and if your skin is very red and
irritated and like your cheeks feel hot
or you're a little flush this is a
really nice way to cool down your face
so been loving that I also have been
loving my lorac unzipped gold palette
this is what it looks like I did get
this during the Ulta 21 days of beauty
event which I will do a haul for you
guys next week and this is what it looks
like on the inside and I really really
enjoy it I feel like this formula is
very very similar to the pro formula
it's not the pro formula but it's very
similar the only two shades I have a
hard time blending out are these guys
right here it probably has to do with
the color but out
that they are a little chalky err now
these more foil shades over here or the
shimmers you do have to go in with a
glitter glue or definitely foil your
brush before putting them on your lid or
lower lashline but overall really really
nice look so I can create with this very
soft and pretty on the eyes so I've been
enjoying that a lot I also have been
loving my Noxzema ultimate clear anti
blemish pads I don't use these very
often because I find them very very
harsh on the skin they're just these
tiny tiny little pads right here and
they smell like a ski but they literally
smell so strongly of eucalyptus like I
just cannot stand it if you have ever
smelled anything from Noxzema you know
what I'm talking about but these little
pads are super super textured and I do
find them to be a little harsh and then
on top of that these do have I believe
1.5 or 2% salicylic acid in them so you
have to be careful but I do think that
they have been helpful for me this week
because I have been dealing with like
little tiny breakouts around this area
which is where I tend to get my hormonal
acne and I don't know I've been enjoying
them a lot so I've been loving those I
also have been loving this little guy
right here this is the fruit pigmented
pomegranate oil anti-aging lipstick from
100% pure this was sent to me for PR and
I just really liked it I you guys know
that I've been talking about the 100%
pure line for a couple of weeks now I
really have kind of gotten into their
brand because they are vegan they are
cruelty-free they have really really
good ingredients the only thing that I
don't like about this is that it starts
to get very very waxy on the lips after
a while and I feel like it starts to
move outside of my lip line another
thing that I want to say is that 100%
pure is super super pricey but I do feel
like their products are worth it so I
really do like this lipstick and this
particular shade is called a Fox Club if
you are curious I also have been loving
this little lip butter here this is from
Korres it is the jasmine lip butter and
I feel like I'm gonna be emptying this
out pretty darn soon but this is a
really really nice kind of tinted lip
butter it's very very moisturizing on
the actual lips and it looks really
really nice and gives a little bit of
like a soft focus sort of nude glow it's
not something that's absolutely
beautiful and it's kind of like the
wrong shade for me but I do wear it at
nighttime and I do find it nice and
hydrating without being like you know to
the point where you wake up and you feel
like you have sticky lips this just
sinks in right away so I've been
enjoying that a lot I also have been
loving my fragrance pairing for the week
of the two that I have been pairing
together are these Charlotte Tilbury
scent of a dream with the Victoria's
Secret paired bliss a sugar
parent casaba melon of body mess this is
the really really kind of sour smelling
spray I know that sounds strange but the
casaba melon and there really does make
it kind of tart and sour smelling and
the scent of a dream does have a really
really strange undertone in it but it
does smell really good
this was also said to me for PR if you
were curious and I would describe this
scent as being very very sophisticated
and kind of like I don't want to say old
ladyish because it doesn't smell like an
old lady it just kind of has that
interesting powdery perfume with a
little bit of like a sour undertone but
it smells amazing it's very hard to
describe the scent but I really do enjoy
it so I've been pairing the two of those
together this week I also have been
loving my two Illamasqua what are these
powder blusher zenit the matte finishes
in the shades and naked rose which is a
beautiful cool toned color as well as
this one right here which is called
tremble and this one is a hot warm toned
Coral they are so beautiful on the
cheeks I love the way they go on I
literally do not have a single blush in
my collection that blends like those or
that feel that's soft and creamy to the
touch and also just like blend out on
the cheeks beautifully with a brush so I
absolutely adore those and then I do
have two products here from YSL that
I've been loving I do love why Estela
you guys they know that they test on
animals so I no longer will be
purchasing from them but they really do
make some beautiful products and the
first one is the baby doll mascara this
is what it looks like it is absolutely
stunning I have been carrying this
together this week with the Urban Decay
perversion mascara and these two pair
really really nicely I've had a lot of
you asking me this week of what I had on
my lashes I would recommend going in
with this one first and then going in
with the perversion and normally I do
like to apply the like natural bristle
one mascara first and then the rubber
bristle wand but I would go with this
one first and then this and they just
look really really good I noticed if I
go in with the urban decay first it
looks a little clumpy but these are both
really beautiful and then of course my
bias self left taste and oil in the
shade a peach me love I absolutely adore
these they are beautiful they smell
absolutely incredible they do leave a
stain behind on your lips and they are
very very moisturizing
I am currently wearing the Physicians
Formula lip oil in the shade a pink
right now and that one's also really
beautiful and cruelty free but there's
something about these why I sell
products that just is like it screamed
luxury and I really really love it
alright next I do
my two Abeka bronzers these are the new
sunlit bronzers I really really been
enjoying these this week as well I do
have the shade Bali sands on which is my
all-time favorite and I just have a tiny
dusting on that right on right now I did
go ahead and put my makeup on with you
guys on snapchat I'm filming this on
Saturday if you're curious but then I
did go in with just a little bit of this
on the outer perimeter of my face after
I got off of snapchat just because I
felt like I needed to bronze a little
bit I feel like it's very everyday
friendly it gives a really really nice
natural Sheen to the skin and it's just
so so so beautiful so that is what it
looks like and then this shade right
here is Capri Coast and I do like to
kind of contour with this one I did a
comparison video against the Physicians
Formula Muro Muro butter bronzer so I'll
go ahead and throw that up in the cards
for you if you're interested I
definitely don't think you need to
purchase these if you already have those
and they work for your skin tone but
they are a nice addition to my
collection and finally the last item
that I have been loving is actually a
nail product I never talk about my nails
cuz my nails look like but right
now we've been looking pretty darn good
and it is because of this this is called
the perfect formula pink and gel coat it
says strong nail care beautiful
brightens and strengthens the nails I
found this in some sort of subscription
box I think it was in like two months
ago maybe like a boxycharm or something
like that and basically it's just this
like clear and liquid that has a little
bit of like a pink tint to it it smells
absolutely god-awful and it takes
forever to dry but what you do is apply
it a couple times during the week and
actually hardens your nails and
strengthens them and it gives them a
little bit of a shine just to make them
look a little healthier so I really like
that I'm not someone who wears nail
polish on the daily so this is just a
nice way to make it look like I do have
healthier nails and I do actually feel
like they are healthier when they have
this on because it's protecting them
from like the environment so anyway
those are all my fails in Halle Grail so
for the week I hope you guys enjoyed
this video thank you so much for joining
me
Happy Happy Easter you guys I hope you
have a wonderful day and I will see you
guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
