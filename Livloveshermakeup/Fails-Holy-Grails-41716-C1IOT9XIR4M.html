my channel and welcome back to my files
and halle grails where I share with you
guys the products that works for me this
week and the products that did not work
for me this week let's go ahead and
start with the product that did not work
I haven't swatched right here this is
the Anasazi of Beverly Hills brow pencil
in the shade taupe I am so unimpressed
with anastacio Beverly Hills brow
products I got rid of my dip brow I got
rid of like my brow powder and this
pencil is really no exception I would
definitely return this if I didn't get
it for half off during the also 21 days
of beauty event this is nothing special
and I don't want to say that I don't
like the anastacio Beverly Hills brand
because I literally have only tried
three products from the brand I've never
tried their liquid lipsticks and I have
never tried their eyeshadows so I'm not
sitting here saying I hate Anasazi of
Beverly Hills I'm just saying their brow
products which I feel like they are the
most known for are just kind of crummy
in my opinion I don't feel like this is
anything special it does have a spoolie
on one end and then the pencil on the
other I do like the actual shade of the
taupe color however I just feel like
this is a very dry formula and I just
don't think it's anything special so
that was definitely they fail for the
week let's talk about some challah
grails i have two holy grail food items
i went through three boxes of these this
week i get these at a place called pic
and SAV which is a grocery store like in
my area and it's the only place that I
can find this brand this is the Philly
swirl swirl poppers assorted swirled
Italian ice flavored squeeze up to so we
have cotton candy cherry melon and
orange dream and these taste like ice
cream even though they don't have dairy
in that I'm an on and off again vegan I
was raised vegan and right now I'm on a
vegan kick so I'm not really eating
anything with dairy in it and these
taste like dairy they taste like ice
cream but they're not there are only 68
calories for like pop and you can get
them in popsicle for more in little
squeeze up form like these little tubes
they are so good you guys like I am
obsessed with these in love just yes
I've been all about that life this week
all right the other food item i have
been loving is this coffee right here
this is the starbucks French Roast k-cup
I normally don't like a dark roast
coffee I am like definitely a blonde
roast kind of girl like I like my
starbucks beranda blends like that's the
only coffee I really drink but this
french roast is so good it's not to like
acidic tasting one of the reasons i
don't like um you know like dark rose
copies is because I find them very
acidic this one is so nice because it's
a very like round and kind of mellow and
it tastes very like nutty it's super
super good highly recommend checking out
the starbucks french roast if you can
alright moving on I have been loving the
be joyful shait and vitamin E shower gel
from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works this is actually
like technically a Christmas sent as you
guys can see it's like a little present
on the front but listen to what it's
supposed to smell like sparkling
clementine golden mango frosted jasmine
winter melon and shimmering sugar now
let me take away all those little fancy
names in front of them you have
Clementine mango jasmine melon and sugar
that smells like a very very spring-like
sent to me and I don't know what it is I
feel like this is just one of those
scents like I I associate it more of a
spring and summer than with Christmas so
anyway I've been using that as my body
wash I love these body washes these let
go like a little goes a long way they're
very thick I find them actually quite
moisturizing again that has definitely
been a holy grail for the week as far as
mascius concerns I have been in love
with my glam glow um gravity mad love
this this is an amazing amazing firming
treatment it is one of those peel off
mask and it actually does peel off
correctly I would say you can get the
whole mask off in about two to three
like peels which is really really good
because sometimes you get those like
peel off mask that literally you have to
sit there for hours like peeling it off
it does come with a little brush I
highly recommend using this because this
is the very very thick formula it's
beautiful though I'm almost finished
with it why can't I open anything like
literally there we go yeah every time I
try and open something on camera it's
too tightly closed but anyway this is
what it looks like and it comes in this
beautiful kind of white luxurious
formula and I actually turned silver on
your face it smells like coconut it's
amazing super super thick formulas you
guys can see so I highly recommend using
the brush because it's really hard to
get off of your fingers and also it's
hard if you want to wash it off you have
to really peel it off so you
put a really thick layer on your skin
let it sit there for about 20 to 30
minutes and then you peel it off amazing
really love it all right for a bubble
bath the sweet i have been using my body
shops glazed apple back jelly this is
another one of those products that's
kind of like a holiday sent however it
really just smells like a green apple to
me so I've been using it as my bubble
bath this week I'm almost done with the
container as you guys can see I've had
this for about maybe like six months now
i really really enjoy it anyway it's
just this really gooey like bath jelly
and you take a little bit of it you put
it under warm running water let warm
running water and then it creates really
soft luxurious bubbles like I say every
week soft luxurious bubbles but really
it creates some really awesome bubbles
it's very fragrant I love it that has
been awesome all right let's move on to
some hair product I have been enjoying
this biosilk silk therapy original
paraben-free made in the US this is just
a hair serum I remember using this when
I was in high school and hasn't changed
it all it still has the same scent it
literally brings me back yeah it has the
same scent it's amazing it's very
similar to the chi silk therapy or I
mean wait this one's so therapy the chi
silk infusion it's a really really
beautiful hair serum makes your hair
super super soft I did braid my hair
overnight last night and I put this over
my braids and I just feel like it came
out really nicely I didn't heat stylet
or anything I normally don't keep style
my hair but I feel like it makes the
cuticle just kind of like point downward
so it looks very nice and sleek and I
really really enjoy this is a fantastic
product and then the other hair products
I've been loving is my Pantene pro-v
moisture mist detangler really like this
I have very very tingly hair my hair is
quite long and it just tangles up like
if the wind blows the wrong way it
tangles up so I need this I love this
and I really really enjoy the scent it
smells like candy and on top of that um
I don't seem to have any issues with
Pantene products i know a lot of people
that actually do i've never had any
issues it doesn't strip my color it
doesn't you know break my hair off i
really really enjoy it and I do feel
like there is some extra moisture in
hair which is great love you alright
moving on let's talk about some makeup
so what I have been doing it for like
foundation and like my base
sweet is using my Revlon nearly naked
foundation in the shade 110 I brave
paired with my tart rainforest of the
seat aqua sealer in the shade fair love
the combination of these two together
the Aqua sealer is really really
gorgeous it's a beautiful really really
lightweight almost like I don't want to
say oily formula because that sounds
wrong but it's a very water like sort of
formula and it sits on the skin
beautifully the shade fair really
matches me well and I put it underneath
my eyes on my eyelids just kind of like
highlight all over my face so that is
what I've been wearing on top of my
foundation as for the foundation the
Revlon nearly naked is beautiful the
only thing i don't like about this is
the fact that it has no pump and it just
gets all gunky and gross at the top
there as you guys can see but this
particular shade 110 ivory is a really
really close match on my skin tone up a
little bit of pink tones to be
completely honest it pulled a little bit
of a pink clit cast on my skin but it
still is really really beautiful and it
looks like skin which I really enjoy for
primer this week I have been loving my
new it cosmetics number 50 serum
collagen veil anti-aging primer I don't
like this one as much as I like the
original pink formulation I think that
one just goes on better it's a lot more
hydrating on the skin this one has a
little more of a tackler base but then
it sets into kind of like a powdery
finish really makes my makeup lasts all
day long it's really really wonderful so
I've been enjoying that and i also have
been enjoying my stay don't stray um
light / medium I primer from benefit I
think it's like a two-in-one concealer /
I primer I put this on my eyelids
underneath my eyes it really really
helps my eyeshadows not to crease then I
really have been enjoying this speaking
of eyeshadows I've been using my tartlet
in bloom palette this week I really
really enjoyed this palette I feel like
you can get some really gorgeous natural
looking eyes with it like you can kind
of play it up and go a little smoky or
you can just do what I did today and
just play with a few colors it's
beautiful the packaging is stunning you
to get a huge mirror here and you get a
gorgeous arrangement of um shades in
here you get a few lustre shades which
are my favorite favorites in here my
favorites are definitely firecracker
rocker and funny girl these are the
three lustre shades i am wearing two of
those today
I have let's see your firecracker in my
crease and then I have funny girl on my
lid these are just beautiful I really
enjoy the luster shades and then I feel
like you get some gorgeous transition
shades in here as well like this whole
row right here is amazing so really
really been enjoying this palette this
week as far as bronzers concerned I've
been loving my new Laura Geller beach
mat baked hydrating bronzer in the shade
sunrise fair this is so pretty like it's
just a gorgeous little cushion and I
love the shade a lot of people have been
telling me that it seems to look very
similar to the Physicians Formula butter
bronzer in the lightest shade there it
is swatched and I need to get my hands
on that I have been very indecisive with
it like I cannot decide if I want it or
not but I think I'm finally just going
to go ahead and get it and see if it is
a Duke because I love the color of this
it's very very natural especially if you
have a fair skin tone like I do it's not
something that's going to look to orange
on your skin it's not going to make you
look like a contoured your face it just
gives you a beautiful like dusting of
color alright for blush this week I have
been loving my rose powder blushes from
Milani in the shades coral cove 05 and
also tea roses 08 i'm wearing tea rose
right now it's gorgeous it just pairs
with everything it's a very neutral sort
of color I really really enjoy it and I
mean look at that packaging and then
coral PO is definitely a little brighter
it really gives you a gorgeous blush to
your cheeks I feel like a lot of skin
tones could use this but if you do have
a fair skin tone I highly recommend the
shade because there's something so
beautiful about it it just looks like
you were out like I'm hyper for a run
alright moving on for a highlighter this
week I've been going a little more
natural with my lorac illuminating
highlighter in the shade moonlight so I
think it was last week or the week
before I was using the shade daylight
which was like a bomb in your face
highlighter I feel like if you have the
light source highlighters and the two
that are kind of like pinky or neutral
tones are a little more natural-looking
on the skin than the two that have kind
of like a gold or yellow tone to them
this one just doesn't have the same sort
of pigmentation it doesn't show up like
wham-bam in your face but that's okay
because I haven't really been into the
like you know seeing my highlight from
outer space as my friend Meg would say I
haven't really been into that this week
so this has been really really nice the
shade moonlight is just a dusty kind of
pink color and it may look like it's
super pigmented right there but when you
blend it out it actually is quite
natural and beautiful so if you are
someone who doesn't like a super super
heavy highlight i would highly recommend
the illuminating highlight from lorac in
the shade moonlight alright for eyeliner
this week I've been loving these two
babies right here we have the Urban
Decay glide on pencil in perversion
which is a matte black I've been brain
that on my waterline as well as the next
slide on eyeliner in brown perfection
these just stay on all day long they're
absolutely fantastic I just dropped the
next one and the next one is definitely
a do for the Urban Decay formulation
like these fight on I pencils the slide
on glide on turn on definitely whatever
it's called those are definitely the
same court kind of formulation as the
Urban Decay one so if you want a cheaper
alternative definitely pick those up
alright for lipstick this week I've been
wearing my lorac anniversary 20th
anniversary lipsticks in the sheath
hotshot and beauty guru I'm wearing cop
shot right now I have been wearing it
for quite a while so I feel like it's
starting to fade but it's a beautiful
bright kind of fuchsia pink color and
then the shade beauty guru is kind of
like a dusty lilac it's actually really
gorgeous and a lot of you were asking
what I had on my lips this week when I
was bringing this so there is hot shot
and beauty guru how funny is that beauty
such a silly name alright moving on the
last two things that I want to talk
about are at the mascara combination
that I have been wearing this week I've
been peering my miss manga rock mascara
from L'Oreal with my L'Oreal telescopic
carbon black mascara i love this miss
manga rock mascara i love the original
miss manga mascara as well it really
just gives crazy definition to your
lashes crazy crazy definition it's got a
really spiky little wind i love the way
it makes my lashes look it can give you
a little bit of a clumpy appearance so
if you aren't into that then I high Lee
would not recommend checking that out
but the L'Oreal telescopic is this
really slim little brush here and it
just gives wonderful wonderful length to
the lashes not a whole lot of thickness
or definition but a lot of length I
II that the wand bends like that but
anyway really really love those two
together I've been putting the I was
missing see L'Oreal one they're both
from l'oreal i have been putting the
miss manga rock one on first and then a
layer of the telescopic carbon black on
top alright guys those were my feels and
holy grails for the week I hope you
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me and I'll see you guys
tomorrow fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
