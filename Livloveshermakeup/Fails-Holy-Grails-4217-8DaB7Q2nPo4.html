channel and welcome back to my files and
Halliwell's where I share with you guys
the products I have been loving this
week and of course the products I have
not been loving there is only one feel
for the week and we are going to go
ahead and start with that it is the
illamasqua powder blusher in the shade
ambition so you're probably wondering
why the hell I'm holding this up I
actually love the illamasqua powder
blush form formulation I have talked
about these before I mean my favorite
blush formulas video which I'll go ahead
and throw up in the cards for you guys I
think these are beautiful I think the
matte finishes are the best for the
actual line but this particular shade
which is called ambition does have a
mauve shade to it or a pop undertone to
it with a little bit of gold glitter in
it and for some reason I really do think
this is starting to go bad now not for
some reason I've had this in my
collection for about 3 or 4 years I
scooped this up all of my Illamasqua
powder blushes I scooped up when you
could still purchase them at Sephora so
I got this way back in the day and it's
just going onto the skin a little more
chunky it's very very hard to blend out
which is so unusual for this particular
formula so I think that you know it's
not really the product itself I think
it's just going bad and yeah I'm gonna
be avoiding that in my collection and
decluttering it the next time I do a
declutter so anyway let's go ahead and
jump into the Holy Grails the first Holy
Grail is actually a combo right here
it's what I have on my face right now
it is the Urban Decay Naked skin ultra
weightless definition liquid makeup in
the shade 0.5 mixed together with the
Becca shimmering skin Perfector liquid
in the shade moonstone these are so
beautiful together they both do pull a
little bit more of like a warmer
undertone but they are absolutely
stunning on the skin this has really
really nice weightless kind of coverage
it's probably I would say light to
medium coverage you can kind of build it
up to almost a full medium but it's
really really beautiful you guys I love
the way that this looks on the skin and
I find that the Becca just gives a
little more Sheen to it and it just
makes it look a very very skin like like
extra skin life so really been enjoying
the two of those together I also have
been loving my humps blushing grapefruit
and raspberry creme even shower
hydrating body lotion I heard from a few
of you that this did not work for you on
this scent is great on mine they were a
few people were saying that there's like
smelled a little bad or something
the center
- absolutely perfection it smells
amazing I have noticed that this does
help to moisturize my skin but it's not
something that leaves me feeling slimy
or greasy or anything like that and yeah
I think it's really beautiful it
definitely is comparable to the Nivea
in-shower body lotions but I do think
that the Nivea ones give me just a teeny
bit more of moister but I did go for the
heavy one because this is vegan and it
is cruelty free so I really been
enjoying this that is what it looks like
and yeah I would highly recommend this
if you're looking into an inch our body
lotion I find that these are
particularly nice during the winter
months when the skin does tend to get a
little more dry alright moving on the
next item I have been loving is my
maybelline superstay better skin skin
transforming powder in the shade at
number 10 at porcelain so I really love
this it's not something I would
repurchase because Maybelline does test
on animals but this is what it looks
like it does lean a little more on the
yellow tone side I use this yesterday it
might get ready with me which again I'll
go ahead and throw up in the cards if
you would like to see it and you can
definitely tell that at least a little
bit of a yellow color on my skin so I
usually do go and follow up with like
the silica powder or some sort of
finishing powder that has sort of like a
white cast to it just because it is a
little darker than my skin but it's
gorgeous I feel like it almost is the
finishing powder it leaves the skin
looking very very smooth and if you are
breakout prone this does have cells
tillich acid in it which is fabulous so
I've really been enjoying that I also
have been enjoying this little fragrance
pairing right here this is the
Victoria's Secret endless love which is
a let see here a blend of apple blossom
and yin-yang this is a fragrance mist
paired together with this where I don't
even know what this is from is John F
Day I think I got it in like a boxycharm
or something like that this is just a
rose perfume the two of these smell
absolutely incredible together and
almost out of this and the reason for
that is because I've actually been
wearing this fragrance duo for about two
to three weeks now so it has definitely
been a favorite I just love the way that
this smells this smells like you just
got out of the shower it reminds me of
like those Herbal Essences like shampoos
and things like that so I really love
endless love and then this is really
really nice I do kind of feel like it's
more of like a fragrance mists bottled
in like a perfume packaging it doesn't
seem to have like that really nice like
kind of perfume the undertone to it and
it really doesn't last a long time but
the two of them mixed together are
absolutely fantastic
alright the next item I have been
is from a meaty makeup this is the
active I liked corrector so this is
basically a skincare item but it does
have a little bit of a yellow tone to it
so on the days where I want to do really
really light color correcting I have
been using this and basically I have it
on today I think you can kind of see a
little bit through the foundation a
little bit of the yellowness but as long
as I put it on first I don't have any
issues I seem to love everything from
this a meet a makeup line that I get in
my boxy charm and my glossy box and all
that kind of stuff so I'm gonna go ahead
and double check on their cruelty-free
status but I really like this and I
really like their soft sokka's primer as
well alright moving on the next two
items I have been loving again are
appearing these this is this is a
Charlotte Tilbury full fat lashes
mascara which was sent to me for PR
paired together with the L'Oreal
voluminous at feline at mascara so this
is a natural bristle wand I think it is
quite pricey you guys and I don't know
if I would recommend purchasing it for
that price like I said it was sent to me
for PR but this is what the wand looks
like kind of reminds me of like the
L'Oreal voluminous wand now I've never
even tried the L'Oreal voluminous but
would I look at the one side by side
that's what it reminds me of it gives
very very nice fluttery soft lashes so
if you are into that kind of look you
would absolutely adore this and then the
L'Oreal voluminous feline is a really
really nice kind of spiky wand and it
does have a rubber bristle want you guys
know I love pairing together a natural
bristle wand with a rubber bristle one
if you want to go more natural I would
go with the natural bristle but if you
like those spiky lashes look a little
bit of clumpiness like I do you would
like this as well so it kind of has a
little twist in it and then they have a
really a really wet formula to it so
I've been enjoying those two and I have
those on today I think it definitely
looks a nice and defined but not overly
clumpy so really been enjoying that I
also have been adoring on my NARS Velvet
look lied in the shade bound I know a
lot of people don't like these but they
are perfect for me I do not like drying
liquid lipsticks I don't like regular
lipsticks sometimes I really just like
something that's like a hybrid between a
lip butter mm-hmm excuse me a hybrid
between like a lip butter and a lip
gloss and that is exactly what the NARS
Velvet lip slides are I don't find them
incredibly long wearing but this
particular shade is gorgeous and very
very creamy you guys kinda reminds me of
just a really nice moisturizing lip
gloss and I do plan on picking up a few
more shades during a V
vib sale which I will have my
recommendations as well as my wishlist
video going up next week for you guys I
think the sale actually starts on the
18th but yeah this is absolutely
beautiful and the only thing that I wish
that they would do is kind of open up
the shade selection more I feel like I
have every single color like this in my
collection already so I would like to
see them come out with some more shades
but yeah bound is a beautiful beautiful
kind of your lips but better shade and
then I also have been adoring on my
Becca shimmering skin perfecter pressed
in the shade rose quartz so this is what
it looks like you guys know I love at
this highlight I have it on on the inner
corner of my eye today as well as on my
cheekbones and I'm bringing a little
more subtle today let me show you guys
what it looks like when you blend it in
and that is what it looks like it is so
beautiful it definitely it's a little
darker than my skin I am currently self
tanned a few of you we're asking what
kind of self tanner I use I have a lot
of backups of the Jerkins natural glow
like the mousse stuff and that is in the
shade if they're too light so that's
what I've been using but yeah this is
what the shade looks like absolutely
stunning it even though it is a little
darker than my skin tone it still
doesn't you know it doesn't mean that
you can't give your skin a glow with a
highlight that's darker so I have that
on today I love it it's beautiful very
very nice nice kind of natural ethereal
glow but you really can build it up if
you want to because those Becca
shimmering skin perfecter press really
can be built up and then finally the
last three products I have here our skin
products our skin care products the
first is the Korres vitamin C active
brightening oil this is the rose oil I
also have this skin diva 20% of vitamin
C plus II for like acid serum this was
sent to me for PR and then finally I do
have my Sunday Riley title brightening
enzyme water cream so what I have been
doing is in the morning I've been taking
probably about three to four drops of
the Korres oil and mixing it together
with the title of brightening enzyme
water cream from Sunday Riley and I've
been wearing that throughout the day and
then at night time I've been going in
with the skin diva serum and then going
in with this all three of these products
are really nice for brightening up the
skin they're very good for
hyperpigmentation after this last
flare-up I was left with some dark spots
on my face so I just wanted to see if I
could kind of combat that and I seem to
be having a little bit of luck so anyway
that is it guys those are all of my
favourites for the week I hope you
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow for shopping spots my stash bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
