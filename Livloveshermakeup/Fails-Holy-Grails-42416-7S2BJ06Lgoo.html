welcome back to my basement on the rails
where I share with you guys the products
that have been working for me this week
and the products that have not been
working for me this week so let's go
ahead and start with the fails I have to
the first one I was really disappointed
with because I wanted to get a full size
of this before I tried the product you
know that's like one of those things i
highly highly recommend trying out a
product and like a deluxe size before
you go and purchase a big one I mean I
know sephora has a good return policy
but I was about to buy this in full size
and I hate it anyway this is the coda
Levi no source creme sorbet moisturizing
sorbet for face now I should have known
it says creme sorbet I for some reason
thought this was just gonna be like
sorbet on my face boy I'm jealous sort
of formula i was going to sink in really
quickly i thought i could pair this on
top of my peter thomas roth 3% retinoid
serum and i thought it would be great
but honestly it's the weirdest thing
it's a very very thick like moisturizing
sort of cream and then you put it on
your face and you're like where did it
go I do have combo skin so I have an
oily t-zone and then I am dry on the
outer perimeters of my face especially
my cheek area this did nothing for my
cheeks like there was no moisturization
there whatsoever it was the strangest
thing so that was definitely a fail I'm
gonna let my boyfriend go ahead and
finish that off because I'm not
interested in it alright moving on if
the second fail is the ultra flesh such
a weird name ultra flesh it's not flash
its flesh ultra flesh the gold standard
black out mascara I'm pretty sure I got
this in some sort of a subscription box
it's a little deluxe I sample I've been
trying to get through my little deluxe
ice samples of mascaras because I have
what like 20-30 the mascaras that are
open currently I want to get through
these little ones so that you know they
don't dry out really quickly I thought
this was going to be great it's got the
kind of one that I'm super interested in
its super super spiky it's a rubber
bristled brush I just thought this was
gonna be great it does nothing for my
lashes truly nothing whatsoever so I'm
going to go ahead and toss that in the
empties bin right now which by the way I
have so many empties for the month you
guys it's like disgusting i'm looking at
the bin right now it's disgusting I both
dude a picture on Instagram it's like
going to implode and explode all over
the place I don't know how I use up so
much every month but anyway let's
go ahead and get into the Holy Grails
the first one is why do I have a piece
of hair just like hang in there oh oh
the First Holy Grail is this perfume
right here I have not been pairing any
fragrances this week because this
perfume stands on its own like it really
really is very very strong in fragrance
and actually lasts all day long this is
the coach poppy blossom perfume I love
these little coach perfumes I have quite
a few of these in different um I was
going to say different shades different
sense obviously someone has like a
little pink bow one has a little green
one and they're all different this one
is the poppy blossom it smells amazing
very very reminiscent of poppies I guess
you could say I'm pretty sure I've
smelled puppies before and they smell
similar to this also you have that kind
of luxurious like powdery sort of I
don't know how to describe it you know
what I mean like Coach fragrance mixed
in there but yeah it really does smell
like flowers really really adores and I
make fun that packaging that packaging
though alright moving on as far as
masking is concerned this week I've been
asking every day because um this
particular product by the way the Kota
Lee the creme sorbate was really making
me start to break out on my forehead as
well and that's I'm pretty sure it was
that product um anyway so I have been
masking every single day I've been
exchanging likely not exchanging can I
speak I have been alternating between
these two masks the first one is the you
now me dermo defense face mask this is
for sensitive skin this is beautiful i
think i got this in my glossybox this
month beautiful really really thick
clear jelly you put it all over your
face you can wear it out you can wear it
as the nighttime moisturizer you can do
whatever you want with it it's amazing
really really beautiful definitely calms
down inflammation and redness and
irritation in the skin and then I've
been alternating it with the Kota Lee
instant detox mass which is pretty much
in the exact opposite of this product it
really goes in and pulls the gunk out
and like cements your face completely
like your face feels like cement you
guys know what I mean
it just is a very very like detoxing it
dries down completely like a clay mask
and it pulls out all the impurities
really really fantastic and I kind of
have been enjoying just alternating a
different mask each day that's been a
lot of fun alright let's talk about some
makeup I've been enjoying this little
Hello Kitty charmi kohl eyeliner kids I
love this this is so cute did I swatch
it no it's watch the eyeshadows i'm
going to show you guys in a sec but this
is such a cute little kids i believe i
got this for maybe ten or fifteen
dollars at sephora these are actually
really really nice they do not transfer
that much throughout the day i'm
surprised i'm wearing a black one right
now and i did use this one yesterday in
a little spring tutorial that i put
together oh my god one just dropped out
anyway there's some really nice shades
in here they're very nice on the
waterline there are very very creamy
because they are a Kohl eyeliner however
I don't find that they transfer leg down
to my lower lashline throughout the day
so I'm kind of surprised because
normally a Kohl eyeliner will do so it
will be like way down here at the end of
the day but these have not seemed to do
that so I have been quite happy with
those let's talk about a hair product by
the way let me talk about my hair
favorite for the week besides this
product I have been enjoying this kind
of crazy like lioness sort of hair um so
how I do this is basically when my hair
is damp when I'm out of the shower after
I washed it I just put my hair into
tight braids like right down there so
one here one here and then I wake up the
next morning and my hair is nice and
like pretty like this and it kind of
looks like a wave or like a crimp my
only complaint is that i don't know how
to french braid my hair so i can't go
from the top so the top of my head is
flat and then it gets wavy and the
bottom the ends are still straight so
that looks kind of strange if you guys
know a really easy way to like think
about how to french braid your hair let
me know because there's something so
complicated about it like i just can't
do it every time I look at like a
picture or a video I'm like what what is
that so
that's what I've been doing I've really
been enjoying just having my hair wavy
this week and then I have been enjoying
my OGX ever straight brazilian keratin
therapy anti-breakage serum I love the
oh gx serums their penetrating oils all
of those kind of oils or serums that
they have are really really good i
recently picked up some new ones that
you guys will see in an alcohol but this
one has coconut oil keratin proteins
avocado oil and cocoa butter in it I
just love this serum it's really really
fantastic if you have very very dry hair
and you really want it like smooth the
cuticle i highly recommend that one and
if you just kind of want to like repair
your hair i recommend the coconut milk
one that's what that one's really good
as well but what i do is after my hair
is in braids i will take a little squirt
of that i'll rub it between my hands
warm it up and then put it over the
braids and it just kind of seals the
cuticle in and it makes it look nice and
soft and shiny all right let us talk
about it he has hope that I had been
loving it so yes i did go and do another
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works haul I did not halt it
on my channel I'm sorry you guys I had a
really busy week this past week which is
why I haven't really been posting
multiple videos a day and this coming
week will also be really really busy
I've actually been doing I'm going to be
doing quite a bit of pre filming so I
did not have time to film the hall that
I did but I did pick up I think six or
eight new deep cleansing hand soap some
candles you know all the whole oh all
the works the works um anyway this is
the nectarine Sun tea deep cleansing
hand soap this has sweet Sun tea and
right next ArenaNet you guys Oh God well
knows Gaza like literally it smells so
good at for a minute I kind of forgot
what like some tea was but you can
actually make some tea like it's where
you put the tea outside and then like
the Sun like makes it for you that
sounds so weird you guys know what I
need my mom and I used to do this all
the time when I was a kid we would bring
the tea outside and then like this done
like cooks at a relative's I'm making no
guns right now anyway Sun tea and
nectarines this smells amazing it's just
so good it's just it's amazing i highly
recommend checking out this fragrance i
have this in the guest bathroom right
now but i'm going to move it into the
kitchen so i can smell it every day
alright moving on let's
about what I've been wearing as like a
base this week on my face I've been
talking about these quite a bit but the
chart to BB Amazonian clay tinted
moisturizer with broad-spectrum SPF 20
in the shade ivory has been just amazing
um it gives very very light coverage so
I have been I feel like something's on
my lip you oh okay anyway it gives a
very very light coverage so if you want
like heavy-duty coverage or you want
like the coverage from like the it
cosmetics CC cream this is not going to
be the product for you it does have a
little bit of a yellow undertone one of
my wonderful subbies did tell me that
there is a lighter shade than this
called fair so maybe I will look into
that one when I get through this one but
for the most part I think this will be
okay for me during the warmer months
when I get a little bit of a golden glow
or tan tan anyway I really do enjoy it
it's a very beautiful on the skin it
gives just enough moisture but it
doesn't leave me greasy very very light
coverage but it's still really really
pretty so I've been enjoying that and
then on any areas that I need to kind of
camouflage darkness or little spots I've
been going in with my hard candy glama
flage heavy duty concealer in the shade
ultra light this is a very very heavy
duty very thick but it's it's an amazing
product all right let's talk about the
eyeshadow palette that I've been loving
this week I do have three swatches here
on the back of my hand because those are
my favorite shades in this palette this
is the forever 21 21 this thing is huge
Oh be forever 21 21 eyeshadow palette I
really been enjoying this I do love this
I really do I know some people probably
don't believe me but I really do like
this palette there are a few shades in
here this blue shade this one and this
one that look amazing they're almost
like a foiled I shadow look how
beautiful those colors are they are
absolutely stunning I've been enjoying
taking those on the lower lash line just
for a pop of color really really quick
and easy in the morning loving that have
been all about that life and I
have been enjoying this thought so too
by the stopped same soft soap soft soft
bodies grab but this is a three in one
product I remember traveling with this
product yes I remember traveling with
this product to Italy with my mom about
three years ago and I used it basically
as a body wash I used it to kind of
moisturize my body and then I also used
it as a scrub it smells again or cast me
it just smells so good okay it smells
like coconut frosting it's just so good
seriously if you've never tried this
particular body wash / exfoliator you
need to it's really really good it's
more of a body wash than an actual like
scrub but it's such a good product my
god it smells good alright moving on
let's talk about an eye cream I've
really been enjoying these two right
here so the first one is from the balm
cosmetics this is the time palm skincare
I perfection gel with Brazil nut and
white tea this has a really really great
consistency to it it's actually super
thick and kind of goopy but it really
really is nice underneath makeup so i've
been using that in the morning and then
at nighttime i've been enjoying the eye
cream from Kota Lee this is a very very
light weight eye cream so this would
actually be really really good in the
morning the reason i like to use this
one in the morning is because it has a
really sort of six silicon e texture to
it and it really makes your um concealer
glide on nicely I don't feel like it's
worth while wearing it at nighttime but
this one I feel like would be really
nice during the day if you do have oily
or combo skin just because it sinks in
immediately like immediately after
applying it so that is a fantastic
product right there the reason why I can
still have my hair kind of like wavy or
curly after like so basically i'll put
my hair in braids and then i will like
wake up the next day i'll wear my hair
down and then the next day i always wear
my hair up in a pony because i have fine
flat hair that gets greasy and
disgusting really quickly I have to wash
my hair every other day but I've been
using this product and it has been
keeping the wave or the curl so the day
after I washed it I can actually throw
it up in a pony and still have wavy hair
I hope some of that made sense anyway
this is the living proof perfect hair
day nightcap overnight Perfector so I
swear this is an amazing product it's
basically
like a leave-in conditioner and styling
cream and it really just holds that wave
or curl until the next day so I can
still have way to hear because I am the
kind of person where I'll have my fair
down and it will be wavy and the next
day it's gone it's just straight again
so I really been enjoying this too set
in my baby crave baby cream baby tinted
moisturizer or whatever this is baby
tinted moisturizer and my concealer I've
been loving my it cosmetics bye bye
pores loose translucent powder I
normally use this as a finishing powder
but I have been really really enjoying
it to actually set my makeup in it looks
very natural on the skin and I just like
that it doesn't give any extra coverage
I've been into really really natural
coverage on my face this week and
probably next week I've just really been
all about that life but this is what it
looks like highly recommend this more as
a finishing powder than a setting powder
but if you do need to use it as a
setting powder it definitely works well
alright let's talk about highlighter
I've been loving this and this was a
recommendation from pretty much all of
you everybody was like you need to get
the laura mercier mag radiance baked
powder highlighter in 01 and i am so in
love it looks like a little moon it's so
beautiful and glowy it just looks like
you have like water on your skin it's
like the sun is beaming off of your
cheekbone it's beautiful I mean I can
imagine this looking absolutely stunning
I'm so many different skin tones like
it's just it's beautiful absolutely
stunning so blushes this week I talked
about these a little bit I've been using
my Urban Decay afterglow a tower
highlighter in the shade fireball I was
wearing this yesterday in my tutorial
it's a peachy color with a beautiful
purple iridescent and then today I am
wearing Snapdragon from Becca which
looks like this it is a hot coral color
love it it just has a beautiful
beautiful sheen and bling to it and i
also have been enjoying Tigerlily from
the luminous blush line and these are
the newer blushes to becca they're
beautiful they have all different kinds
of shades like some really nice pink
colors like foxglove and i can't
remember the other one but they're
really gorgeous love the formulation
love the way they vote on the cheeks
alright let's talk a little bit more
about skin care I have been enjoying
using this touch of polished gentle rice
ensign
powder in the morning to cleanse my face
it is like the lightest most amazing
facial scrub ever it basically doesn't
really scrub your face if you have very
very sensitive skin and you do want to
exfoliate your face I highly recommend
checking this out what you do is you
open it up and as you can see this is
literally just powder in here hopefully
you guys can see that it is powder so
you get your hands wet you get your face
wet you pour about half a teaspoon into
your hand rub it together and then it
turns into a foam on your face and it's
so nice I swear to you Tasha has some
really really kick-ass skincare like
products in general everything that I
tried from them I have enjoyed so this
is definitely a winna winna chicken
dinner in my opinion and then let's talk
about some lip products I'm sorry I know
I have a lot of favorites this week you
guys but I'm going to join these two lip
products here I have this one on my lips
right now this is the new bite Beauty a
moose Boosh lipstick in the shade sorbet
it's a beautiful your lips but better
color and then I also have been enjoying
my YSL the left engine oil in the shade
cherry my chef Lee it's beautiful leaves
a gorgeous kind of fleshy pink color on
your lips alright let's talk about
moisturizing in the morning i have been
using the milk makeup holding water
stick i recently picked this up from the
vib sale love this really really
lightweight if you do have oily or combo
skin this is a fantastic fantastic
little quick cooling moisturizer to rub
on your face in the morning but because
it wasn't giving enough moisture to my
cheek area i did go in with about half a
dropper full of the korres Wild Rose
vitamin C brightening oil this is what
it looks like it does have rose petals
on the bottom I've done like a first
impressions on this product it is
beautiful again if you have oily or
combo skin and you are interested in
trying out oils I highly recommend
checking out this Korres one first all
right as far as primers concerned I've
been loving my Smashbox photo finish
foundation primer in the lite version
really really nice does have a silicone
II sort of slipped to it but not as much
as the original Smashbox photo finish
primer so that's the one that's clear
this one is the white one really nice if
you do have oil air combo skin okay
almost done sorry guys let's talk about
it cosmetics because they recently
released this gorgeous gorgeous
contouring palettes that I'm obsessed
with I've been wearing just the top rope
here pretty much all week I've been
using the mat highlight right here to
set underneath my eyes and on my eyelids
they light contour I've been putting
around the outer perimeters of my face
towards my forehead and then the soft
contour I've been going into like the
hollows of my cheeks gorgeous gorgeous
gorgeous seriously buttery amazing just
oh this is amazing amazing contour
palette i recently reviewed it really
really enjoy that and then at the
mascara that i actually did like this
week was the lorac cobra mascara so I
didn't like the other one the ultra
flesh or flash or whatever it isn't
stuff a weird name but the Cobra mascara
is nice I thought I was going to get a
little more oomph with my lashes with
this particular product but it doesn't
really give that much oh it's kind of
just a natural mascara and I have been
wearing very natural makeup this week
like on my face so I thought oh whatever
that's okay we can do the natural lashes
it does have a little bit of a curved
wand like a cobra head but for the most
part is very very basic it will not
clump up easily which is great it
reminds me a lot of the Maybelline clump
crusher mascara so it is nice if you do
like natural lashes okay is that
everything I feel like I just talked for
like 25 minutes that is everything guys
those were my fails and holy grails for
the week I hope you enjoyed this video
I'm sorry it's a little long but there
were a lot of products that i enjoyed
this week thank you so much for joining
me and i'll see you guys tomorrow for
shop and swatch my stash bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
