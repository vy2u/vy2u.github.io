channel and welcome back to my vegas and
hold of rails where i share with you
guys the products that works for me this
week the ones i really loved and then
the ones that did not work we're going
to start with the fail because the fail
with a big one and I'm so upset about
this I believe I got this in either my
glossybox or my boxy charm I think it
might have been my boxy charm this was a
product that i got this month in my box
each arm box or GlossyBox and this is
the clarks botanicals anti puff eye
cream do you see how giant this thing is
I had such high hopes like literally I
love I creams and I was just like yes
like have a pump you get so much product
in here you get let's see here is 0.5
who announces or 15 ml which actually
isn't that much now that i read it out
loud but it just seems like such a great
deal like you got so much product and i
was really excited for it like
especially because it was supposed to
help like with puffiness around your
eyes it did nothing and it burned the
hell out of my eyes like literally
underneath it burns like a nearby lash
line my eyes were bright red every
single time i used it so i'm going to go
ahead and just toss this in my empty I
don't even want to like give this to a
friend because I'm scared that it will
do the same thing to them it says apply
gently to the eye area morning and
evening and you can also apply to smile
lines and forehead frown lines I don't
know it made my face burn off so yeah
that's gonna go my empty bin oh right
now that was the only fail for the week
thank goodness let's get into some of
the Holy Grail so I have a few bath
items so the first one is the fastened
body works aromatherapy energy lemon
zest body wash and foam bath this is a
product that I am trying to use up
before June first like my use 6 by
summer sort of challenge video and I'm
super super excited because I am making
some progress now I didn't start with
this completely full but oh my gosh it
smells so good look like I know me knows
it smells so good you guys it smells
like ginseng and just like happiness and
citrus and i just love anything with
lemon or or
jenna i just love it it is an
invigorating blend of lemon essential
oil and ginseng that provides a
pick-me-up so I've been using that as my
body wash this week and then another
item i have been loving that it's also a
body wash but a like a shower gel and
bubble bath it's one of those three and
one products from philosophy this is the
fresh cream shampoo shower gel and
bubble bath love the scent of this I
don't know why I got listen like a
little like holiday sort of sets but it
never smelled like the holidays to me it
smells more like spring to me it just
smells like fresh whipping cream or
something like that really really nice
you can use it like I said as a shampoo
you can use it as a shower gel you can
use it as a bubble bath I have
personally been using it as they bubble
bath this week and I have been loving it
now let's talk about masking because
there are two really really good ones
that I have tried this week they are new
to me these are the bozhe charcoal poor
pudding intensive wash off treatment
which technically is a mask and also the
origins by all grains filming deep
cleansing mask with green tea spirulina
and spinach I did a review and demo on
this particular one I will link it below
in the description bar if you would like
to watch it but this stuff is amazing
too so i purchased this for like you
know i don't know like 26 thirty-six
dollars on the safaricom website but
check this out this was one of those
little codes that you type in this was
like free this thing is huge I mean I
personally think it's a really really
big for a like deluxe size sample this
is 25 ml or 0.8 for fluid ounces so what
this is is it's kind of similar to their
um actually you know what I have it
right here they're bosha revitalizing
black hydration shell has the same sort
of charcoal send and it leaves your face
really really dark and kind of like gray
looking it smells really really good
kind of like peppermint if you have
sensitive skin I would not recommend
using this so basically it's like a dark
color and then like a light color and
you mix them together and you activate
it on your face and you can leave it on
there for as long as you want i
literally left it on for like five hours
the other day on the phone with my
friend like she was like I hear we're
gonna wash
mask off and I was like never but it's
really really nice so basically you just
put it on dry skin you leave it on like
a mask I don't know why they don't call
it a mass they call it a intensive wash
off treatment I feel like it's a mass I
feel like the reason they don't call it
a mask is because they have a product
very similar to this which is the
charcoal origins charcoal like mass
which I'm actually not a fan of I really
really prefer this one and when I go
through this I am going to go ahead and
purchase a full-size because this is
really really good it just tightens up
your pores I feel like it helps with
breakouts got a little bit of glycolic
acid in there really really nice for
evening out the skin texture and tone as
well and then the by all greens is
basically just a foaming deep cleansing
mask it's amazing I really really like
it it's a two in one product so you can
actually use it to wash your face or you
can use it as a mask I've kind of using
it more as a facial cleanser but I
cannot speak facial cleanser like after
I remove even after i remove a mask I
know that sounds crazy like after I
remove this product right here at the
poor pudding I'll go in with this I know
it sounds like a lot and it kind of is
you don't want to use this too often i
would use this every other day don't we
sit every day just because it really
really can tighten up the pores quite a
bit to the point where you're just like
squeaky clean and I'm one of those
people I almost mask every single day
I'm not every other day for sure but
almost every single day so I can't use
this everyday but I can use it every
other day love love love all right let's
talk about like my toner that i have
been using i've been using these little
first aid Beauty facial radiance pads
the exfoliates tone and brighten the
skin so you can use them as a toner
they're basically just a little tiny
discs and you just run one over your
face it has a small amounts of glycolic
acid in it so again it's going to help
with like acne uneven texture spots
things like that and also I just feel
like it really helps my skin to not be
so congested I've been dealing with some
really congested skin this week so I
really really enjoy these I put them you
know all over I swiped them I so like
them or still eat them all over my face
and neck and decollete before I put on
like my nighttime treatment and also my
moisturizer and also in the morning
before I put on
my Hungarian water offense all right
moving on ok so I did talk about this a
little bit the OSHA revitalizing black
hydration shell mrs. a state product
that I am trying to use by a June first
I really really enjoy this just has a
really nice kind of tingling like I
don't know I don't want to say
exfoliating like properties to it but
it's not very very moisturizing I use it
as a daytime moisturizer you're
technically supposed to use it as a
nighttime moisturizer it is cooling and
yeah it has oh I think it may have a
little bit of retinol in here as well so
make sure you wear your sunscreen if you
wear this during the daytime like I do
but it says it gives ultralight
hydration and it refines texture it
brightens the skin helps with clarity
all that kind of stuff I feel like it
really really does if you have oily or
combo skin I think you would love this
stay away if you have dry or aging or
sensitive all right and then at night
time for my moisturizer this is another
product that I am trying to use up by
June first this is the Vichy ID alia
skin sleep it's basically like aids skin
smells so good you guys smells like
floral just amazing this it's a
beautiful little light pink color can we
just talk about this little parking
ticket anyway this is a really really
nice lightweight kind of gel mask
moisturizer you can use it either way
it's got a really really thick like a
buoyant it's very the texture is very
like a buoyant buoyant weight is the
word come on why can't I say it I want
to say buoyancy but no boy into the word
anyway it's got a really nice texture to
it I feel like it just glides onto my
skin super super nicely at nighttime and
it doesn't make me break out very very
light on the skin again oily or
combination skin girls or boys would
love that alright moving on because oh I
already tossed it in the empty bin
because that like puff cream or whatever
did not work for my eyes at night I'm I
went in with my royal apothic t-ball
this is a firming eye treatment it's
like a tried-and-true of mines got a
really really nice texture to it very
very creamy very luxurious luxurious I
just cannot say today very luxurious and
i have used pretty much like all of this
app which is amazing because i have a
lot of products and yeah a very very
good eye cream alright moving on to this
little pile over here then loving my
Urban Decay color correcting fluid
I'm just obsessed I'm just obsessed with
these are like my little babies they
look like little Easter eggs I mean
they're just so cute and I can't go a
day with just using one of them like if
I'm going to use one I have to use all
five of them so you have a green one to
counteract redness you have a pink for
brightening you have the yellow to you
know correct any solidness and also the
lavender to like lift fine lines and
wrinkles the peach for you know
hyperpigmentation they're amazing best
color correctors out there for sure all
right as far as blush goes this week
I've been loving my new tortise of blush
palette it looks like this beautiful
beautiful packaging and the shade that
I'm in love with is this one right here
it's called laughs and normally I
wouldn't wear a shave like this like
during the spring and summer months but
I have been loving this it's a beautiful
kind of plummy peachy red color with
tons of golden shimmer in it and I'm
just all about it like it translates so
beautifully on to the cheeks and I were
in it today I was wearing it pretty much
all week I really didn't wear any other
color in that palette I'm just obsessed
with that live shade but yeah you get
some really really nice gorgeous colors
in here I did do a review on these
recently so I will link that below in
the description bar as well who another
skincare item that I forgot about the
only henriksen grease relief cleansing
cloths oil-free poor finding botanical a
chase and eucalyptus you can use these
to kind of tone your face after you wash
it if you're really oily or combo skin
or you can do what I've been doing and
if i'm lazy in the morning and I don't
want to wash my face I just like one of
these all over my face and then I take
one um down it like my neck area and
also my decollete as well they are dual
textures that they have like an
exfoliating side and then a soft side
they smell really good I feel like
they're so great for acne like texture
all that kind of stuff these are a does
best all right moving on the elf high
definition under I setting powder I had
this in my collection and I really just
didn't reach for it often whatsoever i
have been loving this underneath my eye
area it's beautiful I feel like I almost
don't even need to go in with concealer
because it kind of Britain's and it does
have little flecks of glitter in it but
there
not noticeable it just makes the under
eye area look very beautiful I take it
all over my lid as well but loving that
and as far as highlights goes this week
I've been loving my new lorac
illuminating highlighter in the shade
and daylight this is a beautiful sort of
i don't even know this is like a yellow
it's like a true yellow it's not like a
moonstone like becos moonstone it's a
little more yellow than that gorgeous
gorgeous it has like a opalescent white
sheen to it is just gorgeous like on the
cheek seriously it is a little darker
than my skin tone but it just makes my
skin look like it's glowing and
illuminate it and pretty I'm not wearing
it today I'm actually wearing one of the
Laura Mercier the new highlighters which
I do not like um I will talk about those
tomorrow but and this is the making my
skin glow a week I love these definitely
check these out if you guys are curious
by the way I've been asked when I rather
have all of these or the new Urban Decay
hi layers I'd rather have all of these
and I do have all these and all the
Urban Decay funds but I preferred these
ones I just feel like they go on so much
better like onto the skin you can just
dust them on with like a fan brush or
like literally like your fingers like
they're so buttery and creamy I feel
like the Urban Decay ones have a little
bit of grip to them so you really have
to buck them into the skin but yeah
these are beautiful alright moving on my
lip combo this week has been the same
for the entire week wait no okay well
I've been loving is the revlon
colorburst matte balm and also the one
in honey but that's in my purse right
now let's say a product i'm trying to
use up in 2016 but I've impaired these
two together I'm not today because my
lips are a very very chat today but this
is the pot beauty stains day in petal
pout and this just gives a really nice
like pinky fleshy color to the lips and
then I go in with the Revlon color book
colorburst matte balm in the shade 205
elusive which is a gorgeous kind of mavi
color but we're pink we're pink then
loft you see that really really
beautiful love it they smell so good
they smell like the tarts out lips
urgences lips or chances I think you
guys know what I mean they have like
that minty smell I really really love
those and I have also been peering
this with the shade honey as well like I
said but I think that one you might
purse all right let's talk about like
foundations this week so i just did a
first impressions follow up review on
this little baby this is the Rimmel stay
matte liquid mousse foundation really
enjoying this very full coverage I do
have it on today I really like the where
time on it I think less is more with
this product so if you do have like dry
skin bullet you know what if you have
dry skin just stay away but if you have
oily or combination skin go ahead and
just put like one even layer on it will
give you enough coverage and I love that
shade by the way 010 like porcelain it
doesn't pull too much yellow or too much
big all right and then the other
products I've been loving that I'm doing
a first impressions follow up review on
tomorrow is the NARS velvet matte skin
tint this has broad spectrum SPF 30 this
is definitely kind of like a lighter
version like compared to the Rimmel stay
matte this is super matte this is more
of a demi Matt but this is lighter on
the skin it has a little more like sheer
coverage but I really really enjoy it
out of the two I would still pick my
Rimmel if like I wanted an everyday like
flawless face because I feel like you do
have to build this up quite 8-bit if you
really want it to look like I have
perfect skin so yeah I would choose the
Rimmel one but this one is a very very
nice I am joining it I'm not alright for
bronzer this week I've been loving this
wet and wild color icon bronzer with SPF
15 in ticket to Brazil now this is like
scary liked you see it's like very
yellow and orange e but it's just
gorgeous it's got these little fine like
a micro shimmers in it and if I dust
this all over my face it just looks
beautiful almost like my face is like
highlighted not bronze and I feel like
it's not muddy on my complexion don't be
scared of that color I know it looks
like a really really orange but it
really looks beautiful and translates
very very well on to and the skin all
right I've been loving oh my god this
Bobby Brown vitamin enriched face base
this is like a am I think this is an
amazing amazing primer this is what it
looks like it smells like lemon cake
very very moisturizing it doesn't have
like a silicone e slip to it it's not
going to fill your pores or anything
like that but it will prolong the wear
of your make
and it will nourish your skin it will
hydrate its I smell like freakin lemon
cakes so yes I have been loving that and
I think I need to get a full size of
that during the Sephora sale alright
moving on let's see here I've also been
loving the belief the true aqua bomb
this is like their little gel
moisturizer I've been trading this off
with the bow show revitalizing black
hydration gel like going back and forth
just because this one doesn't have as
much moisture and also it's kind of like
a treatment since I had the glycolic
acid in there so if my skin was a little
more like do ride in the morning this
week I would go in with the belief I
really enjoy this a lot it's just a
really nice thick gel creme and has a
lovely scent to it it really really is
nice if your combination or oily skin it
will not weigh your skin down something
I'm talking about here it will not like
leave oil on your skin no residue
nothing like that if you do have dry
skin I would recommend don't they have
another one that's like the true
moisture bomb or something like that I
don't know I think there's a more like
hydrating version that you could check
out but i really really love this one
wait a minute that's not right there's
hl1 and then this is the i think this is
the happier one it's not that heavy so
if you do have dry skin maybe look for
something different but i really really
love that product and then let's talk
about eyeliners a lot of you were asking
earlier in the week when i was doing
really colorful eyes what i was wearing
on my eyes so I was wearing the Urban
Decay 24-7 glide on eye pencils in these
shades accuse which is a gorgeous like
kind of starry night sort of color it's
a beautiful blue with tons and tons of
silver shimmer in it and then also a
vacancy same line same brand and this
one doesn't have any glitters in it but
it's a beautiful like bright teal I've
been wearing those on my waterline so we
have vacancy and then that one is what
the cops a hughes so accuse and vacancy
oh really really gorgeous love the way
that these stay on my waterline they
never smudge they're so freaking hard to
get off I mean I love it it's absolutely
absolutely wonderful for mascara this
week I've been layering two little
babies here I'm trying to get through
these little deluxe sized babies so that
i can start like I don't know I feel
like they're all open to my collection
right now and I'm like these are going
to dry out
so anyway I have been layering the Urban
Decay perversion mascara with the
Lancome Hypnose drama really really
liking this I can really play it up big
and make them look really really like
lucious or I could just do them kind of
natural like today and I really really
loved the combination of those two
together definitely the Urban Decay one
first and then the Lancome I don't know
why would the Lancome is just not a very
good like a base if you're going to
layer your mascara it does not make a
very good base alright for concealer
this week I'd be loving my new amazing
concealer hydrate concealer underneath
the eyes I haven't been getting a lot of
sleep and honestly this has just been
saving my butt I don't know why I
smelled it doesn't smell like anything I
think I'm thinking of the I'm still
thinking I'm dreaming of lemon cake but
anyway this is a wonderful wonderful
concealer is new I did you a review on
it i guess i will link that below as
well sorry there's only so many videos
linked below but my shade is called fair
and it's a beautiful color it brightens
it's enough to like highlight my actual
skin tone which is great it's a very
very light and i love the packaging like
come on it's like Barbie packaging right
there but very very blendable very very
creamy easy to wear underneath the eye
it does not crease whatsoever it's just
not crazy it's amazing and especially
when you set it in with that L high
definition under eyes setting powder I
guess she is not going anywhere alright
guys we're almost I promise the last two
things I want to talk about are probably
my favorites of the week the first is
the glam glow super cleanse daily
clearing cleanser and mud to foam so so
obsessed with this my skin has been
purging a little bit and I heard that
that is common and I know that's kind of
common with glam glow products honestly
when I first started using their mass my
skin purged a little bit but my skin's
been purging a little bit but I don't
care this is so invigorating it feels
great if you have sensitive skin or like
dry skin stay away again this is for the
oily or combination girl / boy is
honestly if you have dry skin or
sensitive skin for small percent very
very minty licorice she and those are
actually skin irritants like I'm
surprised that they put peppermint
leaves in here because that's
technically a skin irritant but it
doesn't bother my skin it seems to help
inflammation little pimples even though
technically it is making my pores kind
of purge right now I still feel like I'm
getting all the gunk off of my skin at
night time and it says it's for a
problem skin it helps the skin
imperfections pori finding mattifying
and clarifying i definitely feel like it
mattifies just an amazing amazing
cleanser I'm like over the moon with
this baby so I've been using that at
night time you're supposed to just apply
like three or four pumps on to dry skin
I actually prefer to apply it like on to
wet skin so after I'm in the shower and
I kind of washed my face like just with
water I will go and then I'll put that
on I just feel like it's easier to kind
of blend yeah I do let it sit there you
know on my face for a little bit because
technically it is eight mud to foam and
it doesn't really like lather up into
like a full-on like the bubble bath sort
of foam but it is quite nice and it just
feels really tingly and awesome and I'm
so obsessed I'm so obsessed alright and
then the last product that i havena
joying this week is what you guys have
been asking about what was on my eyes
earlier this week along with the Urban
Decay um well this is urban decay too
along with the Urban Decay 24-7 glide on
eye pencils it's the Urban Decay a vice
reloaded palette a lot of you been
asking if I would go ahead into a
tutorial I was wearing a lot of let's
see here gold mine acid rain asphyxia
just like really really awesome like
purpley Goldie green colors also on UVB
like love that really really gorgeous
colors in here and yes I will be doing a
little kind of spring tutorial using
these colors because i think this
palette is perfect for spring like the
colors in there absolutely absolutely
amazing you do get a lot of fallout so
be careful I don't know a lot of people
say they don't get fallout with that
palette but honestly it's like fallout
Caloris like color all over my face so
uh huh anyway I hope you guys enjoyed my
fails and how the Grails for the week
I'm sorry this was such a long video and
I will see you guys tomorrow but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
