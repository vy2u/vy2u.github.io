my channel and welcome back to my files
and how to raise where I share with you
guys the products I have been loving
this week and of course the products I
have not been loving and now if you did
watch my stuff shop my stash my shock
pen prank my shop my stash video I can't
say that I'm a shot miss dash video on
Monday then you probably saw that I
picked out a bunch of makeup products
that I absolutely adore so i have no
makeup to talk smack about today all
we're going to be talking smack about is
this little guy right here this is the
skin iceland's solutions for stress skin
Icelandic relief I cream with glacial
flower extract this does nothing you
guys it does nothing okay a lot of the
products that I have tried from the skin
Iceland brand I've been very unimpressed
with I find that they are very harsh on
my skin which is funny because it says
for you know stressed you know sensitive
skin these really give a cooling or
tingling sensation and a lot of people
are not going to like that underneath
the eye area but on top of that this
does not have any sort of illuminating
properties it does not have any sort of
color correcting properties and the most
of all it does not actually moisturize
the under eye area so this is something
that I find completely useless if you
did get this in your subscription box i
think it was boxy charm or GlossyBox
like i did i would recommend you know
dried it out but truly it does nothing I
don't even feel like it makes a good at
base for makeup so this was definitely
the feel for the week did not like that
let's go ahead and jump right into the
holy grails the first two are my
fragrance pairing for the week you guys
know I do like to try out a new
fragrance every single week because i
have a huge perfume collection i will be
going ahead and filming that for you
guys soon but my two little fragrances
for the week have been at my tory burch
perfume which i got from toms or
relatives for christmas paired together
with the bath and Bodyworks PS i love
you fragrance and miss this smells like
a high-end perfume if you are looking
for a fragrance mist and you don't want
to spend you know big bucks on a perfume
that actually smells like a perfume this
one is really good and the to those pair
together beautifully alright the next
item I have really been loving is my
Armani luminous silk foundation I have
been pairing this together with my wild
touché éclat primer this is really
nice in silicone base and the two of
these go together absolutely beautifully
like I said I did do a get ready with me
yesterday did I say that yet like I said
I'll throw it up in the guards if you
want to watch it but the two of these
you could see instantly when I was
putting it on they just looked so so so
beautiful on the skin so I've been
loving the two of those paired together
I do where they shade at number two in
the Giorgio Armani luminous silk
foundation if you are curious i also
have been loving my L'Oreal infallible
Pro matte 16-hour powder now this should
be more like in the like pile it's not a
holy grail but it's also not a fail and
the reason for that is just because of
the color I think it mattifies the skin
it gives a beautiful beautiful
appearance of the skin and it really
does help me to stay completely matte
pretty much all day usually don't even
have to touch up when i use this but
this particular shade right here is
called porcelain and it really is dark
even when i'm self hand which i have
been this week I feel like it's just
kind of bothersome that this is so dark
so that is why I'm kind of putting it
into the light category instead of a
Holy Grail or a fail but a blush right
here that I have absolutely been adoring
is the NYX blush in the shade of
cinnamon now I know they don't make it
this particular formula anymore they
have a new formula that is supposedly
better it has like a smooth surface to
it but I've gone through I think six or
seven of these since I was in high
school this used to be my go-to blush it
is really really beautiful if you have
tan skin if you have fair skin no matter
what this is what it looks like okay
it's a little scary looking about what
you do but blend it out on the skin it
is really really beautiful and it just
gives a gorgeous gorgeous light flush to
the actual face I'm sorry if you can
hear cars down there they're having some
sort of like motorcycle race alright the
next two items that have also just kind
of fallen into the light category again
i love them separately but paired
together just didn't really work over
the lancome hypnose drama paired
together with the L'Oreal telescopic
carbon black mascara these are just not
meant for each other both of them are
very very wet formulas the Lancome
Hypnose drama does have a natural
bristle wand to whereas the L'Oreal
telescopic carbon black does have a
rubber bristle wand but I feel like the
two of these just cannot pair together
nicely because they are just too wet so
it really really starts to clump up the
eyelashes you guys know I love me some
Colombia eyelashes but not when it's
literally like I have one lash you know
like one lashawn my whole I that's how
clumpy they got so I would recommend
using these separately they're just a
little too wet for each other but this
one right here was really great i did
use that yesterday it might get ready
with me another item that I really
loving this week it's my glam glow glow
starter mega illuminating moisturizer in
D shade at nude glow i did use this on
camera yesterday in the get ready with
me so that you guys could kind of see
what it looks like on the skin it is
absolutely beautiful and I've really
been into my glam glow products lately
it doesn't smell like bubblegum and like
lemon pie or something mixed together
has a really really nice fragrance to it
I do feel like glam glow does really
nice fragrances but they do do
fragrances so if you are not into that
then you're going to have an issue with
any sort of glam glow products but this
is beautiful it's not going to give you
a huge amount of hydration if you do
have dry skin I would recommend going in
a prior with like a nice really really
heavy weight moisturizer and then going
in with this but it is definitely better
than like the Becca backlight priming
filter in my opinion it actually does
kind of prolonged aware of your makeup
and it actually gives a glow to your
skin that does not look artificial and I
really do enjoy that so I've been loving
that baby right there another second
care product that I've really been
enjoying it I did not think I would
enjoy is this one hundred percent pure
retinol restorative overnight a ball now
this was sent to me for PR recently I'm
one hundred percent pure has been
sending me quite a bit of their products
to try out today are vegan they are
cruelty-free I really stand by what they
do as a brand however a lot of their
products aren't quite pricey like I'm
not gonna lie to you guys but this is
what it looks like at first I was like
this is a really small containers like a
$45 cream or like I got the ball and the
reason why it is so small is because you
only need the smallest amount so it
comes out in a balma formula and then
kind of like the pharmacy bomb the
firming overnight sleeping a balm you
kind of rub it into your skin and it
turns into an actual retinol oil now if
you have never tried a retinol oil they
do feel a little heavier on the skin and
when I first started using this I was
like there's no way in hell I'm going to
like this I felt like it was super super
heavy Tom tried it out she was like I
hate it it does also have like avocado
oil in it it has an avocado butter it
also does have like some girl sunflower
seed oil vitamin C it just has a lot of
like heavy oils in it and Tom didn't
like it but the more that I used it this
week the more I saw difference in my
skin a lot of you were saying yesterday
in my get ready with me video that my
skin was looking a lot brighter and you
know I'm like two weeks out of a lupus
flare-up I've had a lot of discoloration
a lot of scarring and a lot of back
breakouts and from using this for a
whole week every single night I feel
like it's cleared up my skin so this is
actually something that i do think works
i should have shown it in my skin care
products that actually work video but
i've been enjoying that a lot and i need
to keep continuing to play with it i
also have been loving my urban decay
naked skin color correcting of fluids
the three shades that i have here are
pink yellow and lavender i like to use
the shade lavender to kind of color
correct any sort of salamis in my skin I
you see shade yellow to color correct at
my eyelids and then the pink underneath
my eyes really really good products
right here really even enjoy those and
then I do have two full single shadows
here that I've been loving this is the
palladium crush metallic eyeshadow in D
shade eclipse I do also have the shade
is xenon which you guys remember that
show do you guys remember xenon well was
she she lived in like outer space or
something about anyway there's a really
cute shade as well that has like a kind
of goldish greenish tint to it and these
are just beautiful you guys these are
such a good single eyeshadows from the
drugstore and so are these l'oreal
infallible now the or l'oreal infallible
zoo crease a little bit on my eyelid so
if you do have really mature lids or
very hooded lids they kind of can like I
don't know they tend to ball up on the I
basically but these are really really
nice these ones will not fall up they
have more of a domestic own feel to them
but these are both gorgeous this
particular shade right here is called
Amber rush and they paired really really
nicely with my peanut butter and jelly
palette from to face this week so I love
this palette it's one of my all-time
favorite nine Pam palace that they have
ever released it is more warm toned as
you guys can see and my favorite shades
in here are peanut butter peanut brittle
and I also really love this one right
here which is called bananas now I did
not use bananas all that often this week
but I really enjoy using extra creamy
all over my ayah I use a spread the love
as my transition usually going with like
bananas on the lid and then peanut
brittle in the crease is just a nice
quick beautiful warm tone smokey eye so
I have been in story absolutely adoring
that palette another pilot I've been
really really crazy about and I'm always
like I've always been crazy about this
palette is the Beca jaclyn hill
champagne collection face palette a few
of you were asking last week why exactly
i don't watch jaclyn hill it has
absolutely nothing to do with what any
kind of drama or whatsoever I just can't
watch her because she's very hyper like
I am and she makes me feel a little bit
out of my skin it's just like personal
preference and nothing against her
whatsoever so don't
worried about that but this is what the
inside of the palette actually looks
like i have to or i guess in here you
get two of the satin or kind of like
matte blushes they describe it as in
these shades Pomplamoose as well as a
bit as well and amaretto and then this
one right here is called rose a spritz
spritz why can't I speak Rousey's
Francis which is one of their luminous
flush blushes and that we have two of
these shimmering skin Perfector press
which are both permanent now this one
right here which leans a little more
yellow toned is Prosecco pop and this
one is champagne pop I do prefer
champagne pop just a little more because
it has that beautiful peachy iridescent
but this is a beautiful palette I adore
this it is amazing if that ever comes
back scoop it up and then the final two
items I have been loving are the tart
striking lipsurgence lip creme a lot of
you been asking like what has been that
really nice kind of ma be peachy color
that I've had on my lips this week it is
this baby right here look how pigmented
and beautiful they smell really good
they're pretty long wearing and they're
just very very comfortable on the lips
and then I have also been adoring my
next slide on eyeliner in the shade of
golden bronze I talked about it in
yesterday's video and on Monday if you
have blue eyes you need this I put it on
my waterline it's a very very silky nice
kind of pencil it has a small amount of
iridescent or shimmer to it and it's
absolutely beautiful for light colored
eyes so anyway guys those are all of my
fields and holy grails for the week I do
hope you enjoyed this video thank you so
much for joining me and I will see you
guys tomorrow for shop and swatch my
stash featuring a bunch of new products
