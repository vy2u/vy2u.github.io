channel happy sunday welcome back to my
Bubbe's and how the Grails where I share
with you guys the products I have been
working for me this week and the
products that have not been working for
me this week so let's go ahead and start
with the fails so I have technically
three and I just want to put it out
there right away it's not the products
that were a fail it's the combination of
the two of them together so that was the
kat von d foundation paired with my tart
wipeout color correcting palette I just
felt like I had cement on my face all
week combining these together so in the
color correcting palette there's a few
shades in here that are really really
creamy and kind of heavy like this
particular shade this particular shade
and then also at that contouring shade
right there and then the ones here the
yellow the green and also the orange are
super super slick and oily and for some
reason wearing this underneath the cap
on deep foundation was just like too
much like I just felt like I had
literally cement on my face so um yeah
it's not so much that these products
alone are fails because I do like these
products I don't really know why I was
reaching for the kat von d loc a tattoo
foundation this time of year I do mix my
colors like 42 with like 44 to get my
perfect match um but I don't really know
why I was wearing these even at this
time of the year because honestly this
is a very heavy duty foundation library
heavy duty coverage and I just can't I
felt like my skin couldn't breathe all
week pretty much so today I'm not even
wearing that foundation I actually
swatched it out swatched it out I so
walked it out for the Sephora ethereal
natural finish foundation my shade is
number 10 ivory I really like this
because it's pretty much like a serum
foundation so it's very lightweight on
the skin so anyway yeah that color
correcting palette paired with those kat
von d tattoo foundations just made my
skin feel so slick and like heavy like I
felt like I had like ten layers of
makeup on basically so i will not pair
those together anymore but now let's go
ahead and get into the holy grail so the
first holy grail is definitely this
particular perfume and body mist paired
together so this is the DKNY yes DKNY be
delicious fresh
some perfume I actually use this up
completely I can't get the tiny little
amount at the bottom there I can't seem
to get that out let me see okay there it
is maybe I can get probably one or two
more uses out of this particular product
but then it will be in my empties but
anyway I've been enjoying this
particular perfume paired with my bath
and bodyworks holiday traditions
cranberry twinkle fragrance mist I don't
know these two just pair really really
nicely they have really sweet undertones
and I like the way that they went
together the next item I have been
loving this week is the elf Matt magic
mist and set because i was wearing those
really heavy-duty like face products i
really like this on top because it
helped me from getting too oily
throughout the day so this is really
really nice I love that as a setting
spray definitely prolongs the wear of my
makeup as well and then in the morning I
have been loving my pixie skin treats
glow tonic exfoliating toner with five
percent glycolic acid it has aloe vera
and ginseng in it as well this is such a
nice toner you guys I really really love
it I guess I don't really love the smell
yeah it's the smell and also the price
that turns me off from this product you
only get 3.4 fluid ounces of product in
here and I think this is like fifteen or
eighteen dollars at target which is
really really expensive but it is hard
to come across a drugstore toner that
has glycolic acid in it and honestly my
skin really loves like colic acid most
skin types do except for sensitive if
you have dry skin it will help to
exfoliate your skin if you have
congested oily combination skin like me
it will help with breakouts is just
really really nice so i would probably
repurchase i just wish i could find
another toner from the drug store that
has cyclic acid in it if you know one
please let me know down below but yes i
have been enjoying this quite a bit this
week the next item i have been loving is
my Laura Mercier body bath this is the
crème brûlée honey bath so I normally
saved this for special occasions even
comes with this little like honeycomb
thing where you swirl it and then you
put underneath the bad waters the whole
experience is just really magical
normally I save this for special
occasions but I was thinking about it
the other day and I was like why why
save it for special occasions if I love
it I should just be using it so yeah
I've been using this for about three
weeks now which is why you have not seen
me swap out any sort of bubble baths but
anyway it smells amazing
you guys just like creme brulee
seriously so nice and it makes a really
luxurious bubbles so yeah I am almost
through that little container I will
swap it out for this week because I'm
kind of getting sick of the scent now
just because you guys know me I like to
switch up all times anyway I
haven't enjoyed that a lot and I'm not
going to be withholding products for
myself anymore like if I know that a
product so good and I'm like oh I should
only save it for special occasions I
think that's just stupid if I love it
i'm gonna use it alright the next item i
have been loving is this mask this is
what I've been asking with this week so
the kat von d locket tattoo foundation
does tend to make me break out a little
bit so i've been wearing a salicylic
acid treatment underneath um that
particular foundation and then this week
i have been using a therapeutic sulfur
mask to help any sort of breakouts i
might get so this has vitamin c and
copper in it it is from the acne free
brand you can get this at the drugstore
and its really really nice it smells
horrible it smells just like sulfur but
sulfur is so nice like it's very nice to
decongest pores it's really nice if you
do have breakouts if you have tried
salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide and
you have had no luck with treating your
acne I highly recommend checking out
sulfur really really good mask and also
it helps like calm down your lymph nodes
and stuff like that my boyfriend's all
me that I was feeling kind of sick
because you guys know I had a lupus
flare-up about we can have her two weeks
ago and I would bring this mask all the
way down my neck and it helps to just
helps with like swollen lymph nodes at
that my sense I think that's what he
said something like that all right as
far as highlighting goes this week I've
been peering two products together the
first one is the illamasqua beyond
powder highlight in the shade oh my god
and I will have a follow up review
coming up on this product soon but this
is what it looks like it's just a
beautiful sort of I don't even know it
reminds me of like a gold yellow sort of
highlight if that makes sense it's more
yellow than golden which i think is
really beautiful on fair skin and then I
have been topping it with the Loreal
infallible Pro contour and highlight
palette in 813 light so I've been going
in with this particular color which is
pretty much an exact duplicate just has
that beautiful sorts of
loi yellow glow to it so I really
enjoyed that and i have been using that
contouring shade as well to contour my
face this week this is such a nice
highlighting palette if you have very
very fair skin and you don't want to
bronze your face you just really want to
contour this particular contour in here
from the 813 light palette is super
super ashy and cool toned and really
really nice for chiseling at those
cheekbones girls alright moving on
another a bath product that I have been
obsessed with this week is the soap &amp;amp;
Glory flake away so soap &amp;amp; Glory was on
sale I think about two or three weeks
ago at Ulta literally it was like
everything was half off and now I
believe everything is buy one get one
fifty percent off i purchased some more
stuff because i really do like the brand
and it's funny for some reason i thought
that this brand was phasing out of
stores but now alta carries it so that's
great but anyway flake away is amazing
it's a really really good scrub this is
like comparable to the shave sugar
scrubs honestly the scent is obviously
what I'm so obsessed with the flake away
scent is the same as the clean on me and
also like the hand food sent which is
just that like patchouli and like I
don't even know I think its a mix of
bergamot patchouli and some sort of like
flower it's very very nice it's kind of
like a unisex sort of scent I really
enjoy it but that is what the actual
script looks like you guys will probably
see this in my empties for the month i
think that's coming up next week or the
week after really really nice grub i
like that it doesn't leave me too oily
and it's the scent that I'm crazy about
very comparable to the shade sugar
scrubs like the fragrance level and also
the consistency so I really really do
like this um the shaker scrubs are
definitely cheaper I think this is
fifteen dollars but again if you get buy
one get one fifty percent off it's half
the price so yeah really really loving
that let me know if you guys want to see
a top five series on like my favorite
body scrubs I think that would be a fun
video to film alright the next item I've
been loving this week is the I like
apricot whipped moisturizer I've been
using this in the morning I've been
really enjoying these skincare items
I've been using in the morning so this
is so so so nice you guys it's smell
things actually like apricot like total
novice Gotham like literally it smells
so so so good I really like the
consistency as well it's a very very
thick but it blends in completely and
sinks in super super quickly on the skin
so I've been enjoying that and then I
have been tapping that with the BIOS on
sat the nourisher precious rose face oil
and I got this I believe in my glossybox
for the month I take one dropper full
and just Pat it on top of my skin on top
of the moisturizer and the reason I do
that is because oh my god you guys hear
that my knee just cracked ol lady over
here alright anyway the reason I do that
and I tap it in is because first of all
it's easier to press an oil into your
skin then rub it because when you're
rubbing it is just like oh my god is
going everywhere so it's easier to press
it into the skin and second of all I
like to combat my oil with oil now this
doesn't work for everybody but it does
personally work for me I have combo skin
that gets very oily during the
summertime and putting on oil on top of
my RDO oily skin actually helps to
combat the oil so I do like that and i
did not i have been enjoying this week a
lot has been at my cosmetics feel the
moment primer god i forget how amazing
this product is i actually had a
subscriber the other day comment in the
comments section talking about how she
uses this every day and she just uses
the smallest amount and it makes her
skin feel so baby soft and it really
does the same for me and honestly a
little goes a very long way i don't even
use the dropper i just take what's on
the outside of the dropper i like run it
down like my hand and then i just put it
on my skin it smells so good it's so
luxurious and it moisturizes so well so
i highly highly recommend this all right
and the next item i have been loving is
the nail polish I'm wearing I feel like
red and pink do not go together it's
shirt so weird it like sticks up in the
back of it anyway I feel like red and
pink don't go together very well so
today's outfit it's not really that cute
but anyway this is the SE madison ave
Hugh nail polish I love this color to me
this is the perfect pink color it is
like a muted hot pink and then it has
tiny little silver iridescent shimmers
in it it's amazing i really really love
this nail polish alright moving on the
next item I've been loving is my BH
Cosmetics studio pro HD
brow pencil in the shade blonde it has a
spoolie on one end and then a
retractable pencil on the other I really
like it because this shade is a very
very Ashley even though it's a blonde
and you would think it would be more of
like a warm color it's actually very
actually so now I'm curious to see what
the taupe color is like as far as
eyeshadow is concerned I've been loving
my little Physicians Formula quad in the
shade classic nudes this is classic news
yes classic nudes love this this is just
a little Matt quad these are so worth
that they are definitely a do for The
Naked basics 1 &amp;amp; 2 pallets um there is a
cooler version that I believe is called
Canyon classics or something like that I
both of them that they are so lovely
probably the best Matt drugstore
eyeshadows I have found so far and then
I have been going in with my wet and
wild comfort zone palette which I love
you guys is such an amazing palette you
guys can probably see the shade that I
have been really crazy about this
particular one the definer shade and
also this a brow bone right there so
been wearing that all week really love
this palette honest a really really good
quality for the drugstore alright for
mascara I have been pairing two mascaras
this week the benefit they're real and
I've been topping it with the covergirl
super sizer ran out of the copper girls
super sizer yesterday so this is going
to go the empties bin right now so today
I'm just wearing the benefit they're
real this is one of my all-time favorite
mascaras it's beautiful i love it got
really pokey wand totally up my alley
really really enjoy that product for
lipsticks this week i've been wearing
two of my colour-pop lippie Stix these
are the mat formulas in the shades
tootsie and cookie I have to see on my
lips right now you guys the mat
formulation on these lippie Stix is
really incredible they feel almost like
a satin finish like not even like a
matte finish they're very comfortable
they do rub off onto my flute head joint
so they're definitely not transfer proof
but I do like the colors i think color
pop has some amazing color combinations
i will be doing a video soon on my color
pop must-haves but here we have to see
which is more cooler toned and then we
have cookie right there which is
definitely more of a warm nudie town so
I like cookie the most i do have
naturally like cool undertone so this
vibes with me a little better
but cookies outs are really really nice
for eye primer this week I've been
loving my L'Oreal magic decrease eyelid
primer in the shade 895 it's got sort of
a color correcting tone to it a little
bit of a peachy salmon II yellow color
really liked it it does work really
nicely for me one of my friends Tiffany
said that she heard that this starts to
like break up after a while I've had
this for about three or four months I
haven't had any issues with the formula
but if something does go wrong I'll let
you guys know so that you can steer
clear of this one but so far i really
really do love this for eyeliner i have
been using two of my new make up forever
aqua extra large eyeliners in m80 which
i have on right now which is a plum
color and m10 which is a black i
recently did a that's her upside down i
recently did a review on a little kit
that i got with these these are really
nice they glide on very very creamy and
easily however I will say do you prefer
my Urban Decay 24-7 glide on eye pencil
I just do all right and then the final
products that I want to talk about that
I've been loving this week is actually a
lip balm this is the blistex anti-aging
treatment deep renewal lip balm so I
have with these smallest amount of this
left I'm just going to keep using this
until I use it up I only be tiniest
amount last but honestly this is so nice
for putting on your lips putting on
areas like fine lines that you want to
like see land before putting on your
makeup it's just like a really awesome
product it has SPF 15 in it so I have
been enjoying that a lot anyway those
are my bangles and holy grails over the
week I hope you guys enjoyed this video
thank you so much for joining me and I
will see you guys tomorrow for shop and
swatched my sash bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
