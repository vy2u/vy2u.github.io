happy weekend happy sunday i hope you
are all having a really good time so far
a good weekend it's been super super
warm and wonderful here so i've been
enjoying my weekend but anyway welcome
back to my channel in today's video I
have my face and hauled whales for you
guys where I share the products that
have been working for me this week and
the products that have not been working
for me this week so let's go ahead and
start with the fails the first one are
these olay daily facial cleansing cloths
and emilynoel83 here on YouTube talks
about these all the time and i'm pretty
sure i didn't get the version that she
talked about because i think she has a
normal skin and she normally gets like
the sensitive version I personally got
the deep cleaning version and these are
just so harsh on the skin they're super
super crispy so basically you open up
the package and you have all of these
little cloth here that are actually dry
and you get them wet and then you just
lather up all over your face to remove
your face makeup and I'll see your eye
makeup and honestly I just feel like the
little bead things that are on here are
just super super abrasive I don't like
rubbing this around my eye area I don't
like rubbing it on my face I really feel
like I'm pulling and tugging and I have
been trying to get away from makeup
removing wipes in general because I
really do feel like they pull and tug at
your skin for like removing makeup but
for the most part those just are really
really abrasive they do remove makeup
really well to be completely honest one
little sheet here one little cloth will
remove all of your eye makeup and all
your face makeup even when you're
wearing a super heavy duty you know like
coverage foundation and even just heavy
eye makeup and waterproof eye makeup but
I don't think it's worth it if it's
pulling and tugging at your skin so I
will use the pack up maybe I can find it
for just like removing face makeup
instead of my eye makeup I'm not quite
sure but yeah that has definitely been
up feel this week is just too harsh and
abrasive on my skin and then the second
fail is the tachi luminous dewy skin
miss now this is a fail as far as
setting my makeup is concerned I do like
it as just a facial spritz to kind of
set in my skin care but I really don't
think that this taschen luminous dewy
skin mist is good for setting makeup I
know a lot of people spray it on after
makeup for a really
luminous effect but it will actually
break down your makeup throughout the
day it's really should just be used as
like a skin best um because honestly it
has illegals in it so it will eventually
just break down your makeup I don't feel
like it uh you know makes my makeup a
lot of any longer throughout the day it
really just makes it disintegrates off
my face so that has definitely not been
a favorite and it's really just because
i have been using it as a setting missed
but i really should just use it as a
skincare missed all right let's go ahead
can get into the holy grails the first
is the nail polish i have been wearing
this is the illamasqua nail varnish in
the shade venice and this is what it
looks like and it's just a beautiful
dark turquoise color I really really
like this and i have been wearing this
now for I think four days and it's
definitely starting to chip but the
illamasqua nail varnishes go on
extremely opaque in one coat and I just
love the way the colors look they're
super super bright and nice for the
spring and summertime alright the next
Holy Grail has definitely been my viola
Foss pro I shadow drenched metal
palettes I love this I've been wearing
it all week I have it on my eyes today
the shades that I'm wearing our
confession in my crease and then I have
kisses on my lid and then I put
confession again on my lower lashline I
just think this palette is so stunning I
love the quality of the eyeshadows I
love the colors I love the pigmentation
the blend ability I love everything
about it so this has been a lot of fun
to play around with this week alright a
bath item I have really been enjoying is
my bath body works aromatherapy stress
relief eucalyptus tea luxury bath you
guys know I love these luxury baths I
have them and I think every single
fragrance that you can get from the
aromatherapy line this one's really
really nice because it doesn't smell
super super herbally I mean all of them
do smell like herbal obviously because
of stress relief or a not stress relief
but just like the aromatherapy fragrance
but the eucalyptus t1i just got on my
lip don't eat it Olivia don't eat it um
anyway the eucalyptus tea scent is
really nice because it has a little bit
of like a florally or like you know kind
of like tea scent to it so I like it
during the springtime and these are just
so luxurious honestly if you want really
really nice soft bubbles that also just
help to moisturize your skin I
they recommend checking out the
eucalyptus t luxury bath or just the
luxury bath in general from the
aromatherapy line at Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
all right I have some tees I want to
talk about and it's so funny I feel like
I'm constantly talking about teeth in my
face and holy grails so let me know if
you guys want to start seeing a monthly
t favorites video called tea time with
live where I basically talk about my
favorite teas of the month because i
really like tees and so does tom so
recently we placed an order on amazon to
get like a variety pack of all these
different tea k-cups and there's a few
here that i want to talk about so the
first one is from harney &amp;amp; Sons this is
the tropical green tea and this is an
exotic of green tea blend I have been
loving this this tastes really really
good iced and it's just sweet enough to
the point where you don't need to put
like stevia in or I will mix and honey
on the weekends when I'm not doing a
vegan diet and then when i am on my
vegan diet monday tuesday wednesday
thursday friday i will just use this
with some agave nectar but it tastes
really really good and I personally
really like a lot of my beverages cold
so I make most of these iced but they
are all really good hot as well and then
in the variety pack we got some of these
skinny girl tease and I was talking
about these in my video yesterday my
look of the week video I really really
like these um let's see here we have
peach bellini which is a green tea blend
with like a peach bellini flavor and
then this one is sangria hibiscus and
this is in an herbal tea blend and then
we have a mojito mint which is in a
green tea base and then the last one is
called cranberry Cosmo and this isn't a
white tee base so I believe this brand
was made by someone named Bethany from
like the Real Housewives of New York or
something but i really like these
they're all natural zero calories super
super good ice to the point where you
don't eat just tweeting them whatsoever
so i really like those and i did
actually go ahead and place two orders
on amazon to get a full pack of the
sangria hibiscus and also the mojito
mint I love the taste of mint iced tea
especially during the spring and summer
I think it's so refreshing and this has
a little bit of spearmint in it as well
and then
sangria hibiscus reminds me a lot of the
tazo passion tea but I has a little more
flavor to it so I really like that as
well so those I've done really been
favorite I have another bath item I want
to talk about this is the otx intensely
invigorating eucalyptus mint body wash
this has eucalyptus mint and tea tree
oil in it and I really love this a
little goes a long way it's just a
really thick nice and gel I don't feel
like it overly dries out my skin
whatsoever and the tea tree oil in here
helps keep like my back and shoulders
and chest area really clear a brit clear
of breakouts I've had my period this
week so I do tend to get little um brake
pads on my face and also on my body so I
really really do like this it smells
mostly of eucalyptus so if you don't
like that then don't get this it really
doesn't smell that much of mint so yeah
just wanted to point that out let's see
here as far as lips are concerned this
week I've been loving my Maybelline
matte lipstick in the shade ravishing
Rose this is just a beautiful kind of
cool toned pink color and if you do have
a very very fair complexion like I do it
really just looks like that baby doll
sort of Barbie color pink on your lips
and its really really nice and then also
i've been enjoying the tart wonder
lipsurgence lip cream i'm wearing this
today I love it it's just like this
beautiful sort of hot coral shade I'll
show you guys what it looks like and I
feel like this looks so different on so
many different people I have a friend at
work who actually has this color and it
looks so much darker on her for some
reason but for me personally it just
looks like this hot coral shade I love
how it looks with my skin tone a really
really nice product and I do love the
tarte lipsurgence formulas I love the
mint eNOS and I also just like the
consistency and the easy application you
know it's just a crayon so it's super
easy to put on all right I have a
cleanser here that I want to talk about
that I've been using in the morning this
is the first day beauty skin rescue deep
cleanser with red clay it says it
removes excess oils unclog the pores and
purifies the skin I really really like
this my skin feels like squeaky squeaky
clean after I use this and I think it's
really nice because during the spring
and summer months I do tend to get a lot
more oily
in my t-zone and this has definitely
been combating oil throughout the day on
my skin so I have been enjoying that a
lot as far as the lushes are concerned
if you guys saw yesterday's videos or
mondays video you would know that I have
been obsessed with my the balm of the
lashes so here we have frat boy I've
been loving this color it's just a
beautiful matte sort of quarreling color
and then we have down boy which is a
cool town pink this is the one I have on
my cheeks right now I really really love
this and then the last one is hot mama
which has a ton of shimmer in it it's
really really reminiscent of narsus
orgasm really really beautiful color and
I just love the wearability and the
blend ability of the bomb blushes to the
touch they're not super super creamy and
soft like they're in stain blushes but
they really do wear all day and I think
that's incredible alright let's talk
about primers I have been enjoying my
Stila stay all day a primer or not stay
all day I'm sorry the aqua globe primer
this just comes in a little stick form
like this it's just so nice during the
warmer months because it's cooling and
it doesn't leave any excess like
hydration on your face which I know some
people might like but for me with my
combo skin during the summertime I don't
want that i just want like a makeup
extender and this does the job and then
i've been loving up my Maybelline master
pine long lasting I shadow base in the
shade of 5 10 I love the way that this
goes on it gives a little bit of
luminosity and shame to the eye area and
it really helps with i would say it
helps like a little bit with creasing I
still do get pricing on my eyelids with
any primer but it really does help a lot
with creasing and I find that my
eyeshadow stay very vibrant all day long
it's been very helpful to use and care
with the violet boss palette this week
alright let's talk about the moisturizer
I have been wearing on my face in the
morning it is the cetaphil moisturizing
cream you guys do you say cetaphil or
cetaphil I always thought it was
cetaphil until I saw the commercial and
they were like cetaphil and I was like
I'm sorry but like I don't think that
that is what it should be called I
always thought it was cetaphil but
anyway this is what it looks like it's
just a really thick white moisturizing
cream and it's so funny this was my
go-to moisturizer my freshman and
sophomore year of college this was all I
used and
skin looked so nice and I've been using
it this week and I have had my period
and I feel like it just gives a really
nice amount of moisture it's super thick
but it doesn't leave your skin feeling
Gracie and I just love the way that it
preps my skin from makeup so that has
definitely been a Holy Grail this week
and then I have been going in with an
oil on top of that and I'm trying to get
through some of my deluxe ice samples
that we'll be going bad soon so the 1
i've been using this week is the nude
pro genius rescue oil with omega three
six and nine i really like this i've
been using for pumps of it I like that
the deluxe I sample has a little pump
too I think that's great and really easy
to use with oils but this is a very very
liquid like oil and it sinks in really
relatively quickly and I definitely
think it has been helping combat the oil
on my skin because you guys know I
talked about it last week I enjoy
combating my oil with oil during the
spring and summertime so I've been
loving that let's talk about my
fragrance pairing for the week I've been
pairing these two babies together the
first is the Stila creme bouquet perfume
this is such a beautiful scent it
reminds me a little bit of the viktor
and rolf flowerbomb but a little more
powdery it definitely has that sort of
like a baby powder scent to it but it's
got like a creaminess like the vanilla
and baby powder and then it has that
floral scent I just tasted it again I do
this every week you think I would learn
anyway it's just a beautiful beautiful
fragrance smells like baby powder mixed
with flowers and I have been pairing
that with the bath and Bodyworks sheer
freixa body splash and you guys have you
heard the bath and body works is
bringing back I think eight or ten of
their old like signature fragrances this
is one of them they have cucumber melon
out right now on the website they're
going to have plumeria and all of those
are really really good old sends like
country apple that they used to have so
stay tuned for that this summer if you
want to pick up some of these old sense
but yeah these pair really really nicely
together the Stila and the sheer afrasia
all right as far as highlight is
concerned this week i've been using one
of my favorites this is the hourglass
ambient strobe lighting powder in the
shade brilliant this has quickly become
one of my top five highlighters I love
it I think it gives a beautiful glow to
the skin and i have it on today I just
wearing a light dusting this week but
you can build this up on the skin it
never empathizes your pores or texture
it just goes on so beautifully it
actually kind of air brushes your skin
it's amazing really really love that and
then as far as concealer is concerned
this week I've really been enjoying my
amazing cosmetics concealer in the
hydrate version and I just love this so
much the shade i have is ivory and I
find this super super humectant and
moisturizing I did a whole review on
this I really think it's an awesome
product and come on look at that like
Barbie pink packaging it's beautiful
it's so creamy and blendable that you
can just like blunt in and with your
fingers which is what I've been doing
this week and they final I know that I
want to talk about this week are Maya
mascaras I've been peering these two
together really like the outcome I have
it on today and I just do one layer of
each the first is the Physicians Formula
captive booster I'm sorry sexy booster
cat-eyed collection mascara it's got a
huge wand but this makes a really really
nice base mascara it really plumps up
the lashes and thickens them and really
kind of preps them for having like a
layering mascara on top the laura
mercier extra lash sculpting mascara and
black onyx is so inky and black and
amazing the one kind of scares me but
honestly this kind of wand is right up
my alley and I really like the way that
it just thickens and defines and also
just lengthens my lashes so those are
all of my fails and holy grails for the
week wait i forgot one item and it is
the cover girl al a CC cream you
guys know I talk about this all the time
it's always a Holy Grail I only have
about this much left and they have
discontinued this item but I don't care
i've been using it this week i love it
it's an amazing product my shade is 105
ivory and that is it those are all the
products that i have been loving and
hating for this week i hope you guys
enjoyed this fails and Holly granules
and I am going to go ahead and film my
shop and swatch my stash for tomorrow
for you guys so if I'm in the same
outfit that is why I have a busy week
coming up with lots of gigs so I'm doing
a bunch of pre filming but yeah I'm
gonna go film that now and I really hope
you guys had a great weekend bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
