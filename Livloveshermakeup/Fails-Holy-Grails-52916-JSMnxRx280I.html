welcome back to my miles and have a
great so where I share with you guys the
products that have been working for me
this week and the products that have not
been working for me this week I look
tired and that's because it's morning
out when I'm filming this um I took a
five hour nap earlier and I'm just
really wired I know you don't look super
cute right now I'm like a little like
shaggy dog but um it is what it is
anyway before we get into this week's
favorites and not favorites of video i
just want to say really really quickly I
did shop my stash on Monday with you
guys it was the pretty in pink version
and I was so excited to use those
products honestly I didn't get to like
half of them this week I think there was
one day where I wore all of the products
that I shot my stash for so I am NOT
going to be showing like half of them
because I mean if I only used it like
one day out of the entire week i just
don't really think it's worthwhile to be
like oh I loved it or I hated it because
I don't really know I couldn't really
form an opinion on it and the reason for
that is just because I was having shows
this week and i was using makeup that I
know works for me when I'm on stage if
that makes sense so they were items that
were not in my little shop and swatched
my stash drawer so I do apologize if
there was like I don't know a pallet or
something that you saw on Monday that
you really wanted to see my opinions on
I will go ahead and try and pull those
particular products into another shot my
stash of video sometime soon so that i
can give you guys my thoughts but yeah
we don't have too much to talk about
because like i said there's only a few
makeup items that i really was using
like consecutively but let's just get
right into it the first item i want to
talk about that is they fail for the
week is the herbivore rose hibiscus
coconut water hydrating face mask so i
just i know i'm like the scent of this
it's okay i do like the fact that it is
quite hydrating I like that it's not too
sticky on my face but honestly I think
there's alcohol in here it stains my
eyeballs it tastes like alcohol and it
does make me break out now it only
really made me break out like the first
two days I used it and then the
breakouts subsided but I was getting
like big pimples and like random
is it might amount like that so yeah
this was definitely the feel for the
week i will use it up completely but i
would definitely not repurchase if there
is alcohol in there alright so let's
talk about the Holy Grails the first is
the bath and body works aromatherapy
stress relief eucalyptus tangerine body
wash and foam bath I have been using it
for exactly that body wash and also as
my bubble bath it says eucalyptus and
citrus essential oils help clear your
mind to support focus I thought this
sent would be kind of strange but
honestly it smells really really good
it's a little tart and kind of sweet
from the tangerine and then the
eucalyptus is very calming so I've
enjoyed that products a lot this week
the next item I have been loving is the
Urban Decay a one-and-done naked skin
hybrid complexion Perfector this is what
I have on my skin today that's all that
I'm really wearing as a base and I just
use two pumps of this it is a little
dark on me the shade is light with all
gummed up on the cat and the cat that's
super super gross what did I say on the
cat on the cat on the cap it's all
gunked up but it is a little dark for my
skin tone so I do use like a powder to
really kind of lighten it up but I
really like this product i have been
using this on the days where i was on
stage i've been using this as my primer
and then on the days like today where I
just was like at home just hanging out
then I have just been using two of this
two pumps of this two of this the whole
tube guys I use two tubes a day no two
funds to this and I basically have just
been putting that on with a like Sigma
what is this brush right here Sigma
Brown kabuki f82 brush this has been a
favorite as well so yeah I really
enjoyed this it basically have very very
minimal coverage is kind of like a
tinted moisturizer and a little bit of a
BB cream combined it does dry down to me
like Demi matte finish so it is quite
nice but it doesn't give tons and tons
of coverage it's just what I have liked
on the days where I don't have shows
because I feel like my skin can breathe
all right I have another foundation that
I have also been enjoying and i have
been using again the sigma round kabuki
of 82 brush i have been spraying it down
with the pixi by petra make up fixing
missed and then i have been going in
with the covergirl Ready Set gorgeous
fresh complexion oil-free foundation in
the shade 105
really like this I do not have to touch
up my teeth on throughout the day when
I'm using this product so a really
really nice foundation when you do kind
of sheer it out with like the makeup
fixing this and also a brush it gives
you sort of like light to medium
coverage nothing crazy but it just feels
really really nice on the skin it
doesn't feel heavy or cakey and I do
feel like it does build quite nicely in
areas that you want to build it in so
like I said I have been enjoying that
sigma brush and what I do is I just buff
at the foundation or the one-and-done
Prefecture in circular motions and then
areas where I want a little more
coverage i will just stipple it on
alright i have also been loving my it
cosmetics bye bye pores this is the
translucent and transparent version and
i just love this for using be buffing
technique especially when I'm on stage
and if you don't know what the buffing
technique is it's basically where you
put on your foundation and you're you
know color correctors everything and
then you put on your contour your blush
your highlight and then you go in with a
loose powder and a buffing brush and you
buff in circular motions and it just
makes everything look like streamlined I
don't even know how to describe it it
just makes sure that there are no harsh
lines on your face like where you can
see blush and then contour and things
like that everything just looks
beautiful I learned that from Wayne Goss
he's amazing and it really does work
really really well and your face looks
perfect like in photos just amazing so i
love that i also have been enjoying my
to face with hearts bronzer in the shade
of sweet tea this looks really really
beautiful when you are on stage in front
of like a bunch of bright lights a lot
of people were complimenting and saying
my skin looked a very dewy and glowy and
i like to just take a really really
fluffy brush and just dip right in there
tap off the excess and put that on the
outer perimeters of my face I feel very
glowy and pretty when I use it and it's
gonna be like a favorite bronzer of mine
for the summer probably all right and
then to set in those two bases i have
been using my ELF tone correcting powder
and cool because both of these do run a
little dark on my skin and like on dates
days like today I didn't really go in
like contour or you know tons of blush
or anything like that I do want to make
sure that I kind of
chin up the base so anyway I have been
using this and you guys know this is a
favorite of mine loving that I did shop
my stash and pull out all of my Urban
Decay color correcting fluids for the
week but i really only ended up using
two so the two that I really really
loved this week where the lavender shade
which looks like this and normally I
don't use this nearly as much as i did
this week this is really nice for like
lifting solemnis and like yellow tones
in your skin and I don't know I feel
like I wasn't getting enough sleep and
my skin was looking a little yellow and
kind of like jaundice and sick hoping I
don't even know but I like to just apply
this leg above my eyebrows under my eyes
right underneath my jawline it's really
really beautiful and I just I really
really love this I have like a newfound
love for this particular lavender shades
and then I do go in with my foundation
and then I top it with the urban decay
naked skin corrector in the shade pink
this is basically like a brightener /
concealer it's amazing it's so beautiful
underneath the eyes you can put it down
the bridge of your nose on your chin in
you know a little like what's it called
tree shape on your I never know what
people do like some people go in and
they literally will do like a star on
their forehead I just don't be it's like
a little tree anyway I really really do
enjoy this this is probably one of my
all-time favorite um color correctors
out of all the brands even like just the
Urban Decay color correctors I love the
pink one in the yellow one and I guess
the lavender one the most alright moving
on I have been loving my bath and body
works aromatherapy energy orange and
ginger body mist I haven't been doing
any sort of like fragrance pairings this
week just because I've been really busy
and I got a little run down after all
four shows not gonna lie of the little
run down and I wasn't feeling so hot so
I don't know I just feel like this
particular mist is super nice and
especially when you don't want to be
bothered to do tons of makeup or to like
get yourself completely ready and like
to you know perfume pairings this is
just nice it smells really really good
and orange and ginger essential oils are
uplifting to release tension and sharpen
the senses I do feel a little more alert
when I use this so yeah I've been
enjoying that a lot i have been a little
fatigued this week which is kind of
unusual
me alright so moving on the next item I
have been loving is the Beca jaclyn hill
champagne collection face palette I've
been using this when I was on stage this
week and it's just gorgeous you have two
shimmering skin Perfector xin here in
the shades Prosecco and champagne pop
you have to mineral blushes in
Pomplamoose amaretto and then a luminous
blush in the shade Rose a spritz I have
Rosie spritz on today and then I do have
it talked with champagne no sorry
Prosecco pop at the blush topper so I'm
champagne pop and Prosecco pop are
definitely darker than my skin tone so I
like to use them as blush toppers and I
was getting a lot of compliments on
stage people were saying my skin looked
married like oh you know like really
really glowy so I think it is probably
because of this I just really really
love this palette and it is definitely
worth the 52 dollars in my opinion so I
have really really been enjoying that
and if I did want to go in with a little
extra like bronzer instead of going in
with the two-faced one because that
doesn't really build up color that well
I will go in with the amaretto shade
right there and just kind of dust that
all over my face to kind of lightly
bronze or contour it's actually a little
rosy toned and it looks beautiful on
fair skin as like a contour bronzer
alright I'm moving on I do have a blush
here that I did shot my stash with this
is the wet wild fergie center stage
collection blush in the shade brush with
danger I love the way this looks it's
just a cool toned pink color with like a
milky undertone and it just makes you
look so fresh and innocent and useful
and cute and I just want to pinch my
cheeks what I have this on honestly it's
just really really pretty color I love
anything cool tones pink not so much on
the lips but definitely on the cheeks
all right there is a primer that I did
shot me stash with that I have been
loving I wore this for a pretty much
late I think two of my shows and then I
wore this today as well this is the
shiseido glow enhancing primer this is
just a little deluxe size sample as you
guys can see this is beautiful and I
almost don't want to check at the price
or put it in my love's list on these
Sephora website because she sado is a
pricier brands they are mostly known for
their skin care they're kind of like it
cosmetics like their makeup products
that they do have actually have like
skin care in them
so I do trust the brand I think they're
fantastic but I'm sure this is very
pricey but it's very very um sort of
tacky feeling I feel like your base just
adheres to it really really nicely and
it really does enhance the where time on
your foundation but not just that it
smells really good and it actually is
quite moisturizing so you're rubbing it
in it feels moisturizing then it gets
tacky and then you start to see this
beautiful like silver sheen so I don't
know I just feel like this is like a
gorgeous like three and one product if
you have dry skin and you really want
some luminosity i would highly recommend
checking this one out alright and then
the nest I know is to see last item this
can't be oh my gosh ok this is the last
item this is the Maybelline master
conceal camouflaging concealer in the
shade and number 10 fair this is my last
favorite for the week I have been
enjoying this a lot it's so beautiful
underneath the eye area I don't use it
to cover like acne scarring or pimples
just because I don't think it's that
great with coverage I don't think it
really conceal things that great even
though it is a concealer it's just
beautiful underneath the eyes if you
need a really really quick little wash
of color underneath there and i like
that it does have a little bit of a warm
undertone in it because it cancels out
any sort of blue tones so yeah I have
really been enjoying this this has
definitely been a favorite for the week
and I feel like this video is so short
like what's happening i feel like i
should grab random stuff and be like
this anyway i hope you guys enjoyed this
video thank you so much for joining me
but i'll say isn't holograph yield and i
will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
