welcome back to my files and how the
rails for the past two weeks so last
weekend I did not make a fails in Holy
Grails video because I was not feeling
well so I thought I would just share
with you guys my fails in Holy Grails
for the past two weeks because I have
not changed anything I was not feeling
good so the last thing I wanted to do
was you know shop for new makeup or pick
out new haircare stuff like that so I
kept it really simple for the past two
weeks and I am eager to shop of my stash
now because I feel like I've been using
the same things forever but anyway let's
go ahead and get right into it I'm going
to start with the fail so they first
fail is the origins clear improvement
active charcoal masks to clear the pores
I've never liked this I have a deluxe
sized sample of this and like ten little
mini like sample sizes I'm gonna have to
give those away or something because I
honestly just don't like this mask I
have been using another mask that I
really been enjoying this week that's
the Peter Thomas Roth Irish more masks
you guys can see I used up this little
container for the past two weeks I use
that little container up and I tried
using it this math and literally I've
used this like every other day and
practically like it's like practically
full you guys see that it looks like I
haven't used anything which really
irritates me because a little goes a
long way with this product but I really
don't like it I know a lot of people
compare this to the glam glow super bud
treatments I don't think they're similar
in any way shape or form every time I
use this and I have like active
breakouts or something like that it does
nothing for my pores they really don't
like it I do prefer the origins pore
pudding over this so I don't know what
it is this really just doesn't do
anything for my skin I feel like it
actually makes it kind of itchy maybe I
have a little bit of an allergic
reaction to some of the ingredients in
here but this was definitely not a
winner winner chicken dinner if you know
what I'm saying so that's easy first
fail the second sale is okay it's not
just this hand sanitizer it's this
overall scent from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
this is the Honolulu Sun antibacterial
hand gel it's just the Honolulu Sun
fragrance in general I will not purchase
this in like a deep cleansing hand soap
formula or god forbid like a 3-bit
candle there's something about the
combination of this particular fragrance
and I
last night on these oh I read last night
on the Bath and Body Works website it's
a mixture of lime and coconut and I
sometimes can't handle lime and coconut
together they just are very like
overwhelming for me for some reason and
this was like the most overwhelming hand
sanitizer ever like just the scent
I couldn't even use it on my hand so I'm
actually gonna put this in my empties
bin I really tried to use as much as I
could but it's just one of those sets
that gave me an instant headache and
sometimes I do like coconut and lime
combined together but it has to be very
very subtle I hate coconut and lime
combined together when it's super super
like strongly fragrance and the only
reason I got that particular scent was
because it came in like a little bundle
of hand sanitizer pack so I switched
that out for the golden pineapple luau
so that's a little nicer I do enjoy that
one but anyway that was definitely a
fail um I definitely don't recommend
checking out that fragrance from Bath
and Body Works if you don't like coconut
and lime together because that's like
the most overwhelming coconut and lime
fragrance ever alright and in the last
fail for the past two weeks have been
this dr. jar to be V Meath plus
contouring bronzing cream contour thing
so this came in a little kit I am trying
to use this product and the other two
products up in 2016 the corrector shade
and the highlighting shade I really
really enjoy and I'm going to mention
those as Holy Grails but I don't like
this product it stains my sponges so bad
I can barely get this product out of my
sponges and then on top of that it tends
to lean a little to a sheet like I
sometimes wish there was maybe a little
more of warmth to it I can't use it
around my forehead or anything like that
it easy cream products but I just feel
like it looks very muddy on my skin of
course they will finish it up because it
is a product I'm trying to use up in
2016 but this is kind of a fail for me
so I do not like that alright those are
all the fails for the past two weeks now
let's get into the Holy Grails the first
Holy Grail is the soap &amp;amp; Glory clean on
me cruelly a quick clean on me crazy
clarifying the shower gel this is what
it looks like I feel like I've used a
lot of this product already like that
much and I've only had this for maybe a
week and a half now
I did a Ulta haul last week and
literally the day after I did that home
I got this I got this
and I also got the flake away scrub in
the mail and I was like of course I did
my fall and I forgot to mention these
products but anyway right now like soap
&amp;amp; Glory is like half off on the ulta.com
website so you can get like this body
wash for like eight dollars and fifty
cents which is a great deal you do get
sixteen point two fluid ounces in here
which is amazing but it's the scent that
I'm obsessed with it smells exactly like
hand food if you've ever smelled the
soap and glory hand food hand cream this
is exactly what it smells like my
boyfriend said it smells kind of musky
and manly and I also think it smells
very perfume me so it's kind of like a
unisex sort of scent really love this
and I do like that it is kind of creamy
and clarifying like I really feel like
it rinses me clean it's very nice really
really enjoyed that a lot and then these
seconds Holy Grail is actually a laundry
item these are these snuggle scent
boosters there's 56 in here this is the
cherry blossom charm scent so this is
new I get them in these huge tops like
this because I like to throw one or two
packs into my laundry every single time
that I've washed my clothes um Tom is
very sensitive to fragrance so he can't
use any of these I was really surprised
I've been sick and have like I've been
dealing with a lot of rashes on my body
I have lupus so when I get sick I get
lots of like skin you're taping like
stuff going on on my face and body these
do not irritate my body whatsoever
sometimes you can have a reaction with
like the laundry and then like the stuff
you put into it like maybe it makes you
itch II or something these don't do that
at all and they're so cute they're just
these little pink pods and they smell
amazing the cherry blossom charm scent
is so so good so I highly recommend
checking these out I also like the unnie
UNSTOPABLES like the in wash scent
boosters but I like these because
they're in little pack forms and this
one and the iris blue breath Lilla I
cannot speak iris blue bliss scent or
something like that also smells really
good alright moving on as far as
highlighting this week I have really
been enjoying my wedding while two mega
Glo illuminating palette for the past
two weeks that keeps saying to last week
you guys know what I did for the past
two weeks I've really been enjoying this
this is in the shade 320 Kat mark pink
and wet and wild recently kind of
reformulated this you get a lot more
product in here and I have been liking
this for highlighting but I put it all
over my blush so it's more of a blush
topper and the reason for that is
because of that little dark strip right
there it has a little bit of like a
reddish sort of plummy color to it and
it just is a little dark as a highlight
for me so I have been using this as a
blush topper all over my blush really
really enjoyed that for setting in my
makeup the past two weeks I've been
loving the elf illuminating mist and set
I've been wearing a lot of like
illuminating like tinted moisturizers
and products and primers and things like
that so I really really do enjoy this I
feel like it does prolong the wear of my
makeup and I feel like it also kind of
hydrates your skin and just leaves a
beautiful finish overall speaking of
primers I have been pairing my ambient
light correcting primer from hourglass
in the shade luminous light with my NYC
City proof 24 hour istick primer I love
the two of these together they have a
very similar sort of finish I love the
NYC because first of all it's just like
a jumbo cram like this and you literally
just kind of paint this onto your eyelid
and underneath your eye if you want to
it definitely helps with creasing it's
super lightweight and if you do have
oily skin or really oily eyelids I think
you would love the formulation of this
and then I like the ambient light
correcting primer because this kind of
blurs imperfections it sinks in
immediately again really nice if you
have combo or oily skin it just sinks
into your skin immediately and it does
leave a beautiful sort of luminous glow
to the skin without being like super
super in-your-face so I've been enjoying
that I have been enjoying this little
food items here this is the celestial
Seasonings green tea this is the green
tea cake cup I've been enjoying green
tea I just basically put it in I'll put
it like in a mug make it normally in the
Keurig and then I just add ice into it
and I've been loving green tea so this
has been really really delicious this
week I don't know what it is sometimes
green tea can upset my stomach if I
drink it just alone same with black tea
but for some reason this particular K
cup is really really nice it's not too
overpowering and I don't feel like I
need to sweeten it at all so I've been
loving that I do have a fragrance here
from Bath and Body Works that does not
give me a headache and that I've
actually been obsessed with and this is
a long time obsession every single
summer when they released the island
margarita scent at Bath &amp;amp; Body Works I
have to get everything
Island margarita I have the 3-wood
handle right here and also the deep
cleansing hand soap right here the
three-week handle honestly smells the
best but this comes in pretty darn close
it smells really good as well we have
this in the kitchen right now it is a
tropical it is a tropical I cannot speak
a tropical blend of Mandarin lime and
white nectarine and seriously this is
like the freshest most amazing scent
ever if you want something that's not
overpowering but smells like I don't
know like lime and freshness and
nectarines you have to get this there's
like no warmth in there no like
sandalwood or coconut or anything like
that the cans I have burning right now
is called Fiji white sands in the Beauty
room that's like a really really kind of
like sandalwood vanilla sort of musky
scent this is like the other side this
is a very fresh scent so I really really
like it it says it has sunny lime in its
sweet mango juicy plum fresh salted rama
it just smells so dang good you guys so
I really really love this fragrance you
can get it in any sort of form but I
highly recommend the three-way candle
alright so moving on let's talk about
what I've been wearing as my base this
past couple of weeks so you guys know
I've been liking the hourglass what does
it call the hourglass luminous light
primer and then I have been topping it
with my Neutrogena Healthy Skin glow
shares illuminating tinted moisturizer
for the past two weeks I know I keep
saying the past week but you guys know
what I mean I really like this a lot at
the shade I have this ivory to fair
number 10 it has broad-spectrum SPF 30
in it
it smells like sunscreen it feels like
sunscreen it's a little oily I feel like
the glow that you get is coming from the
sunscreen however I think this is really
nice it's a very light weight it doesn't
cover everything you guys can probably
still see little patches on my face
today where I have like stuff that I'm
dealing with but for the most part I
really like it I think it's beautiful
and it gives a very very minimal like
coverage but I have been enjoying that
the past couple of weeks so this has
definitely been a Holy Grail
another Holy Grail or yeah well this
came as part of the little trio that I
was talking about the little dr. jart
trio so I don't really like the
contouring one but I do like this
highlight and the neutralizer I take the
neutralizer which is kind of like a
yellow cream I put that underneath
eyes to block out any balloon tones and
then I go in with the highlighting shade
which is really really light which I
enjoy if you do have fair-skinned and
you're looking for a cream highlight so
this is wonderful I put it on the bridge
of my nose you know in the little
triangle what's this I dude this looks
like a square I did in the little
triangle underneath my eyes on my
eyelids anywhere I want to brighten and
I really do like it
both of these are all three of them
actually have broad-spectrum SPF 30 in
each one so I feel like this is awesome
like you're really getting a lot of Sun
if you're wearing it those products and
then like I said I've been going in with
this which have SPF 30 so I feel like my
skin has really been protected during my
lupus flare up which is good because I
get even worse like rashes and stuff
like that if I'm in the Sun alright for
my brows I've been loving the models Co
more brows in the shade light / medium
this is very similar to the benefit
gimme brow but I like it a little more
because it's a little more ashy I
naturally have a cool undertone in my
skin so Ashley colors just look a little
better than warm colors do and I really
like it it has the same sort of wand as
the benefit gimme brow but I find that
it pulls too much product when you just
take it right out of the packaging so I
do like to wipe the excess off on a
tissue but I like how it gives a really
natural looking brows gives a little bit
of like fibers or extensions in there so
kind of lengthens your brows thickens
them up without looking artificial
alright and then for mascara I have been
pairing up my Dior / curl iconic / Carla
iconic / curl mascara with my Tarte
lights camera lashes I'm trying to get
her some of my deluxe eyes and mascaras
because they're already open and I have
so many on my collection so I almost I'm
done with this one this is the Dior you
guys can see it has a really big sort of
like caterpillar II that's like a
caterpillar wand like it's really big I
feel like it only works well on the
upper lashes it really does curl them
nicely but the lower lashes like this
thing is huge it's hard to get in there
you kind of have to go under and pull
this way so I only like it for the upper
lashes but I think it's really nice
paired with the Tarte lights camera
lashes which is a really wet formula and
I just like the way that they stack on
top of each other so those have been
favorites for the past two weeks I've
been wearing one eyeliner
for the past two weeks on my waterline
and my tight line and that is the urban
decay 24/7 glide-on eye pencil in the
shade mugshot this is a beautiful pinky
taupey color and I don't know I just
really love this color I think it would
be beautiful if you did like a wing with
it if you know how to do a wing or if
you did I mean you really could do
anything with it I just like putting it
on my waterline I feel like it gives a
little bit of definition without being
like boom stark white or stark black so
I really do like that start black does
that make sense
start white or like really really vivid
black for my lips I have been enjoying
these a lobbies have been such a
lifesaver because my lips have been so
chapped these are these Sephora brush
balls I love these I am wearing the
shade today which is called 6:02 2a
which is a bright vivid kind of reddish
orange mandarin color and then I also
have been enjoying this pinky shade here
which is 601 5a and this is kind of like
a blushing rosy sort of color really
really beautiful and then the last one
I've been join is the plum shade which
is 603 2a and I really like this one as
well it pulls a little more purpley
tones so I really love the three of
those they're very very comfortable to
wear on the lips they're kind of pricey
these are like twelve fifty apiece at
Sephora but honestly I'll probably end
up collecting all of them because you
can wear them like well I was going to
say goodbye then when you're practicing
your flute if you play flute like me you
can wear them when you're practicing
flute they don't rub off on the head
joint they're very comfortable to wear
if you have extremely dry lips they're
comfortable so I really have been
enjoying those and then let's talk about
my fragrance pairing for the past two
weeks I've been loving up my Viktor and
Rolf a flower bomb this is just like the
epitome of spring in a bottle for me I
love this I was so depressed the other
day I tried putting on a little bit of
my Marc Jacobs modern wah and I ran out
of it I was like don't you hate when you
run out of like a really expensive
perfume it's like they're so expensive
but anyway Flowerbomb is amazing I have
almost gone through probably half of
this it just smells like powdery flower
flowery flowery powdery floral leave
scent I don't I don't know how to
describe it it's so good it really is
beautiful some people say it kind of
smells like gram
I have never noticed that what this
product I think it just smells are
really really beautiful so I've been
enjoying pairing that with my I got it
in my mouth you know I have been
enjoying pairing that with my
strawberries and champagne body mess
from Victoria's Secret I think I've
talked about this it's like I want to
choke on this there's something like
literally like Oh Olivia why are you
spraying that anyway this is the
strawberries and champagne fragrance
mist from Victoria's Secret I like the
two of these together they have the same
sort of undertone and they just go
really nicely together so I've been
enjoying that now let's talk about some
skincare items so before we do that let
me talk about my eye shadows and blush
for the week for the past two weeks past
two weeks guys this is the perfectly
perfect hue I and cheek palette from
Stila in the fair / light shades so you
get two blushes in here five eyeshadows
really really neutral and natural I
bought all four of these pallets I love
them they're so compact and gorgeous I
really love this cool toned pink blush
right here enjoying this color right
here from my lid really really beautiful
this look good one this one good one so
I've been using that for my blush and
also my eye shadows and then a for my
lips
oh god because they've been so freaking
chapped at nighttime I've been putting
on my creme de Rose lip balm from Dior
oh it smells so good and you guys can
see I have hit some major pan on this
baby I really really like this it's got
a thick sort of petroleum texture to it
but it really makes sure that like you
wake up with really nice soft lips so
they're not dry at all they're just very
very soft and nice feeling so I do enjoy
that and then since my skin has been
somewhat sensitive I haven't been piling
tons of skincare on it but I have been
enjoying my Mario Badescu facial spray
with aloe herbs and rosewater very
calming very nice on the skin I have
only the smallest amount left but I
really like this I feel like any time my
skin was getting itchy or I don't even
know just like Raschi I would spray this
on and it would calm down instantly so
I've been enjoying that a lot and then I
also have been enjoying this Mario
Badescu eye makeup remover gel this is
the non oily version this is
good if you want something that's not
going to sting your eyes and something
that is not oily and going to blank you
momentarily you definitely need to check
this out it's so good it just comes out
like this you just pour it out to em and
then I rub it all over my eyes I take a
cotton pad rub it off so so so good it
does not leave any sort of residue like
any sort of residue whatsoever on your
skin so I really have been enjoying that
from Mario Badescu and then the last two
items I want to talk about wait the last
three items the first one is this little
brush map from Real Techniques I've been
loving this this is like so good at deep
cleansing your brushes you're supposed
to use this little area for your eye
brushes this for your medium brushes and
then this for your big brushes I use
this one this little area here for the
small brushes and then the other ones I
just swirl all together I love this
though this really really helps to deep
clean your brushes it's really nice and
it really helps you not to use too much
like cleanser if that makes sense so you
only need the smallest amount and then
you basically dip your brush in there
swirl it around rinse it off really
really awesome enjoying that product a
lot and then like I said I really have
been loving my Peter Thomas Roth Irish
more mud black purifying mask really
enjoy this I feel like it decongest my
skin without leaving any sort of
irritation or redness or leaving it
feeling tight it's really just
absolutely lovely and then also at
nighttime I've been loving my origins
drink up intensive overnight mask
I've been masking a lot and not really
putting on any serums or toners because
my skin has been so sensitive but I do
like this one it really does quench like
the thirst in your skin it quenches your
skin's thirst I cannot speak it quenches
your skin's thirst so if you are very
dehydrated and you just need to kind of
calm inflammation down on your skin this
helps a lot so I've been enjoying that
as well anyway those were my fails and
hub rails for the past two weeks I hope
you guys enjoyed this video thank you
for joining me and I'll see you guys
tomorrow for shop and swatch my stash
