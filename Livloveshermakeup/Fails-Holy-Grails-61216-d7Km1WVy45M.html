this video I am sharing my friends and
how the grounds for the week so if you
are interested in seeing the products
I've been hating this week and the
products I have been loving again please
just keep on watching alright so we are
going to start with the fails as always
the first sale is a big fail and a lot
of you were asking about this product
after I hauled it last week in my
Sephora haul this is the two-faced
mascara melt off cleansing oil for
waterproof mascara this is what it looks
like and I was all about this product I
actually think the formulation is
beautiful i think it's a wonderful
product however you guys it's the
application of this product a lot of you
were asking for your first impressions
and I knew right after using this the
first time that I just could not go any
further with this product I will be
returning it to sephora the thought
concept behind this is that you take
this little mascara wand and you go
ahead and you quote your lashes you
leave it on for about 10 seconds and you
rinse off with water well you guys where
do you think all that leftover mascara
is going it's going right back onto the
wand and I did not realize it until I
was actually doing it and then I took a
closer look at my wand it was gunked up
with tons of little mascara crumbs and I
thought that was so gross I don't think
it's worth it to have a product like
this and then have to wipe it off before
inserting it back into the tube and I
just thought how can you think about
like all the discussing little mascara
crumbs that are going back inside the
tube I thought that was really really
gross and it was so funny the night
after i used this um like the next day
my friend Meg Bernardo commented on the
video and was like wouldn't you get like
the excess mascara on the one and that's
exactly what happened so I can't get
passed out I think that's just really
really gross so I will be returning this
to sephora so that was definitely the
first fail for the week the second field
for the week was this L'Oreal infallible
Pro matte 16-hour powder now it's not
the actual formulation of this I think
it's beautiful my issue is the shade
this is the lightest shade I go like
this because it's really not light at
all I've been wearing self-tanner the
past couple weeks and this is still too
dark on my skin I don't know if you guys
watch the look of the week yesterday or
knotts about I used this and you can
literally see when I start to apply this
at my foundation and my face just start
to darken up like intensely like a lot
and I just don't like that so overall
the formulation is nice it does keep me
really really match you guys know the
lore'l Pro matte foundation is actually
my Yesi lore'l lore'l Pro matte
foundation is one of my all-time
favorite foundations and this powder is
beautiful it keeps me really not but
unfortunately the shade is just too dark
so I wish they did offer a translucent
or transparent a version of that and
then the final fail is kind of in
between a fail and a Holy Grail it's not
a product that I hate is not a product
that I love I just like it and either
see covergirl super sizer fibers at
mascara I did review this if you guys
saw the video the other day it was
called I think reviewing new drugstore
makeup that was up a few days ago and
yeah this is just okay it's definitely
nothing amazing and i think the original
super sizer is so much better than this
but i'm wearing it today just have one
coat of this on my lashes it's nice like
i said but I would not go out of my way
to repurchase this product all right
let's go ahead wait no I'm sorry and
there is another fail we had for this
week and then the other item that I have
not been liking at all is actually this
Lancome base so I was pairing this with
the mascara and I have tried the mascara
without this space so I know it's not
the base that's making this bad it's
just this is just a product I like I
don't hate it or love it but this one I
actually do hate this is the Lancome
what is it called exactly super
enhancing mascara base I feel like this
did nothing for my lashes I'm really
used to using a really gloopy kind of
thick um lash primer if that makes sense
I love the Urban Decay subversion lash
primer but yeah this did nothing I don't
feel I could put any little fibers on my
lashes it didn't help with thickness or
length it really did nothing so that was
definitely a fail as well all right for
fails for the week that is quite a bit
so let's go ahead and get into the holy
grails the First Holy Grail was
definitely my lorac pro 3 palette I have
been loving this it's just so beautiful
you can put together such quick awesome
looks with this like literally these
shadows are just so beautiful i love
these lorac Pro formulation they're so
easy to blend they're beautiful aiya
shades terracotta pink nude blanc and
light gold on today this look literally
doesn't me like three minutes to
complete I just think the shadows are
beautiful
let the pigmentation is amazing and the
formulation is amazing so that has been
my first holy grail for the week my
second Holy Grail has actually been a
dry shampoo powder so I know that I've
just been throwing my hair up like this
recently and for those of you who don't
follow me on instagram I did make a post
yes I still I'm chopping my hair and
dyeing it I know that my new growth is
really really horrible right now which
is why I've been throwing my hair into a
messy bun every day because when I wear
it down it's so much more noticeable and
it looks absolutely horrible so that is
why I've been wearing it in a messy bun
for like literally the past month if
you've been curious it also looks
strange if I wear it in like a ponytail
you just can see the new girl that looks
horrible but anyway yes I am getting it
cut and colored unfortunately my
hairdressers father had like a massive
stroke and she hasn't been back into the
salon yet I do not trust anybody else to
first of all take off like 10 inches of
my hair and then let alone bleach it so
I will be waiting for her to get back
into the salon so hopefully i'll get my
hair done before july but yeah anyway
doesn't ride to talk about that quickly
but i really do like this product it's
really nice the only thing i don't like
about it is that it will believe a
little bit of residue like on your
forehead if you don't wipe it off after
but this is the Stila hair refresher in
the creme bouquet scent and I actually
talked about the creme bouquet sent in
the perfume version of a few weeks back
I really like the scent it's very
powdery but very slowly and I just
really like this powder it basically
volumizes your hair it puts a little
texture in it's not so much like the
bumble and bumble preta powder that has
a lot more texture to it but this
definitely helps with oiliness and
grease eNOS and it just gives a little
bit of volume and freshness to the hair
so I've been loving that this week the
next item I've been loving is my josie
maran argan enlightenment in luminizing
veil this is a beautiful highlighter
probably one of my all-time favorite
highlighters it is darker than my skin
so sometimes it can be used as like a
blush topper but I love it it's just
that golden glow like right onto the
cheekbone I think it's absolutely
stunning it's a beautiful beautiful
color and once you kind of blend it out
on the skin it really just looks like
this beautiful soft focus kind of glowy
effect and I just think it's absolutely
stunning I love the color of this and
even
does have like large sparkles in it it
doesn't show up on the skin and it
doesn't make your skin look textured
actually the formulation of this reminds
me a lot of the hourglass ambient strobe
lighting powders which are one of my
all-time favorite highlighters as well
so highly recommend checking this out if
you have the chance all right I have
also been loving my tart um let's see
here confidence creamy powder foundation
in the shade fair neutral I've been
using a really really light weight
product for my base this week which is
also a fail oh my god we have five fails
I'll get into that in a second but I've
been using that this week and it just
hasn't been enough coverage for me so
I've been following up with this
particular foundation really love it
it's beautiful it does give a nice
amount of coverage and if you really
buff it into the skin it looks beautiful
so anyway you guys yeah it looks like we
actually have five fields for the week
which is a lot but the bare minerals
complexion rescue tinted hydrating gel
cream has not been doing well on my skin
this week this has been breaking up like
a mofo like literally within four hours
this is broken up on my skin i am using
it in a current project pan video and i
don't have too much left hopefully i
think i was like right here and i may be
like right here right now so i know i
can get through it but goodness this
really breaks up on my skin I think it's
because the actual broad spectrum um
yeah the broad spectrum SPF 30 in there
is titanium dioxide which is a physical
sun block which was really damn greasy
so that has definitely been a feel for
me this week as well it's just a little
too oily for my skin sorry forgot that
one was a failed not a holy grail but a
Holy Grail that I have been loving is
the lorac take me to 10 Tico palette
this is beautiful you get to matt
bronzers on the top and to shimmer
bronzers on the bottom I've been wearing
a lot of this shade right here which is
called tan Antonio and I've been using
this as my blush this week I think it
pairs beautifully with the josie maran
argan enlightenment is luminizing veil
it's just like this really bronze pretty
look on the skin and i have been using
self tanner this week which by the way
that is also a favorite the Jergens fair
/ light self tanner i've been loving
that i've been using that for about
three weeks now and I really
nice light glow that I have on my skin I
did exfoliate my skin my light in the
shower so I don't know if it's showing
up completely right now but I think that
this is a beautiful palette and it's
just been complimenting my whole little
tan thing very well so yeah I've been
enjoying that the next item I have been
loving is a skincare item this is the
josie maran pure argan milk intensive
hydrating treatment I've been using this
as my moisturizer and you know oil
basically in the morning and you guys
know I do like to comp at my oil with
oil so normally elko and with a
moisturizer and then go in with an oil
on top there's no need for that when you
use this product this is a moisturizer
plus oil built into one and it's not too
oily so I really really enjoy this and
that has been definitely a favorite this
week I have to sort of concealing and
highlighting products that I've been in
loving they benefit dandelion shy beam
love using this to highlight my face the
only thing i don't like about it is it
has a really flimsy little wand or
applicator but for the most part this is
beautiful for color correcting and
highlighting the face and i have been
loving my L'Oreal visible lift blur
concealer I'm gonna be sad when i use
this up this is also in my project pan
my shade is 301 fair this is just so
beautiful it has this gorgeous satin me
at texture to it it covers like pimples
and things like that very well but it's
honestly it performs the best when you
wear it underneath your eyes so I really
have been loving that let's see here I
have a perfume that I have been loving
it's actually a little deluxe I sample I
don't know if you guys have noticed but
I have been trying to incorporate more
of my deluxe I samples into like my life
basically so when i'm doing shop and
swatch my stash you probably see a lot
of little mini like mascaras and things
like that I just have so many and I'm
trying to use them up so I have like a
whole plate filled with small deluxe ice
samples this one happens to be a spray
which I feel like you never find with
these little tiny bottles but anyway
this is the clinic happy perfume and it
really does make me happy this was the
first perfume I ever had as a young girl
this was the first one I ever got it was
from my grandmother she bought me a
bottle of this and i love it it just
makes me happy the scent is beautiful
and i definitely need to go ahead so i'm
trying to students let myself um but i
definitely need to go ahead and purchase
a both sides of this because it's just
such a happy smelling perfume
it brings me back and it does remind me
of my grandmother we did pass away on
Halloween so I miss her a lot anyway
moving on I have a few primers here that
I've been loving the first is the Beca
backlight priming filter god this stuff
smells good it feels really good on the
skin it gives the beautiful luminous
glow to the skin and I do feel like it
does prolong the wear of my foundation a
little bit now if you're working with a
really oily products like this it really
builds nothing but for the most part if
I'm using just a normal like satiny or
matte foundation I do feel like it
prolongs the we're a little bit I mostly
just like it for its luminosity and also
the sense though and then for eye primer
I've been loving my benefit Air Patrol I
talked about this a lot it's just so
beautiful it has a color correcting sort
of consistent not consistency a color
correcting sort of tone to it it
definitely has a yellow base it's really
nice it's got a wonderful silicone
applicator as you guys can see the super
squishy and soft and I feel like if you
do have dry skin or aging skin this is
such a good eyelid primer to try out
because it's not going to cause any
dryness around your eyes so I really
have been enjoying and loving that I do
have a face mask this week that i have
been using actually for the past like
two or three weeks it is the
charcoal poor pudding one of my
subscribers was acting me hey have you
tried the boat show charcoal up or
pudding and then he just reminds me to
go and kind of soup um I'm gonna say
stop and swapped my stash it reminded me
to go shop my skincare stash and I did
pull it out this is one of my favorite
mass from bow show to be completely
honest this is just a little deluxe I
sample that I got from typing in a code
on these so for our website but this is
awesome I'm not a huge fan a lot of
bosha masks I love their makeup break up
quote lensing oil I really like their
facial washes but for some reason I feel
like they're charcoal mask is not that
great I never really liked their um
black luminizing peel-off mask but I do
like this one and I like their drink up
hype I'm intense with hydration mask
this one is cool you have a mixture of
charcoals here so you have a black
charcoal and then white charcoal you mix
them together they turn into like a
great gray look basically great color on
your face it feels really tingly it
feels invigorating I am all about that
bigger
life and it kind of tingles on your face
it definitely helps with pore size and
oil and congestion and things like that
i have had my period this week so I've
been just having big cystic pimples this
has definitely helped to kind of calm
those down and definitely helps to
remove excess oil so i really like this
if you do have oily or combo skin i
highly recommend checking that out I
have to lip products or three lip
products i should say that i have been
loving the first is the let's see here
rep on super lustrous lipstick in the
shade 450 gentlemen put it up gentlemen
prefer pink this is what it looks like
it's a gorgeous pearl color and i'll go
ahead and squash it for you guys it's
just so pretty i read it on my lips
today i love the way it looks it's super
lightweight the revlon super lustrous
formula is one of my favorites from the
drugstore for sure and i also have been
loving my teefies melted liquefied long
wear lipstick in melted peony this is
just one of those like go to lippies for
me i feel like it looks beautiful on
everyone and i just love the shade i
have noticed i've had this tube for
about a year and is trying to get really
really runny like the consistency so i
have to really shake it up but there is
melted peony so really really beautiful
it does dry down mat and yeah I've been
enjoying that a lot this week all right
now the other lippy I've been enjoying
is actually like a treatment so I've
been using this at night this is the
Cary Grant whip whip and this one
happens to be in the radiant color so I
have I think five of these liquids i
love these Cary Grant lip whoops I rave
about them all the time I think I have
two in my makeup collection or yet no
I'm sorry I three in my lip balm
collection including this one and then I
carry one in my sleep bag and one in my
purse this radiant color is sort of just
like a light pinky shade I'll show you
guys it doesn't really you know show up
with that much color there is if you
guys can even see it um this is the
peppermint sent it smells so so so good
you guys I love these Cary Grant lips
they are free of petroleum and anything
bad they really really coat the lips
nicely and they moisturize insanely well
so I've been enjoying that Libby Olaf's
this week I do have a hand cream here
that I've been crazy about you guys do
anything crazy about soap &amp;amp; Glory lately
I have just been enjoying so many of
their products I love their original
pink scent and this
food hand cream has the original pink
sent it does sink in relatively quickly
and it says it has shea butter macadamia
oil and marshmallow whatever that means
so that's really fun and I've been
enjoying that a lot let's see what else
am I missing anything oh yes I have
let's see here one more I don't know two
more items to talk about the aero skin
care the first is the oly henriksen
invigorating night treatment I've been
using this at night time again my skin
has been very textured and oily this
week I only have the smallest amount
left of this it really doesn't smell but
I don't know why it sniffed it oh you'll
probably see that in this month's
empties but I love this it is an
overnight hahax exfoliator and restore
pastor basically so you're getting your
alpha hydroxy acids and things like that
and you're really really lovely
overnight treatment especially if you
have combo or oily skin it can dry out
your skin if you do have dry skin so
definitely stay away but really really
good if you want to help with texture
and pores and breakouts basically all
right and then I do you hike or in today
I cannot see I have been loving my Urban
Decay 24-7 glide on eye pencil in the
shade faint this has been pairing so so
so beautifully with my lorac pro 3
palette you guys it just has those
gorgeous like topi tones in it so this
goes really nicely it's a light taupe
color and it is completely matte
beautiful on the waterline and then
final item that I've been loving this
week is this facial spritz and it's
actually buy the brand spritz ok this is
the breathe deeply minty relief for your
lungs and mind it is a facial spritz
that is cooling stimulating soothing
balancing purifying and invigorating and
boy is it invigorating you guys it
smells like eucalyptus and mint I love
eucalyptus mint anything i just love
especially in the morning like waking my
skin up love it so what I've been doing
is setting in my skincare in the morning
and at night I sprayed all over my neck
and my ear than my face and I just love
it it's amazing so I really been
enjoying this I actually got this in my
popsugar must have box which um for the
last month which was made it came so
late I got it like two weeks ago so it's
been sitting behind the interview of my
videos of you spot a pink box or if you
spot a pink box in my thumbnail
it had been sitting behind me and I did
like what I got in that box I didn't
unbox it because I got it so late but
yeah this was in there and I really have
been enjoying this which is great
because the one that I used up before
that one which was the herbivore bros
hibiscus hydrating coconut milk no
coconut water facial spray I did not
like but anyway been loving that and
yeah I feel like I had a lot of fails
for this week but I had a lot of
products and made me very happy as well
so I hope you guys enjoyed my fence and
how the graph use and i will see you
guys later today actually i have a
review going up on the young wild &amp;amp; free
pellet from Tarte alright guys I'll see
you then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
