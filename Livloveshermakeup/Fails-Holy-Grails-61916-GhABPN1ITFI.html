this video I have my feels and how the
rails to share with you guys where I
talk about the items I have been loving
this week and the items that I have not
been loving this week so we're gonna go
ahead and start with the fails as always
I have two skincare items here this week
there have not been working for me at
all
the first one is the glam glow youth
cleanse now you guys know I love
products from glam glow like a lot but
I'm just not into this one I just don't
feel like this is anything like the
actual mud treatment like the treatment
mask and I really like the youth mud
treatment mmm sorry I have something in
my throat anyway I really like the youth
mud treatment but this is just nothing
like its little sister or twin products
I felt like it didn't exfoliate my skin
at all and it's not something that I
would purchase any full-size so that is
a first sale for the week the second
fail for the week is from dr. Brandt
this is the dr. Brandt pore dermabrasion
pore perfecting exfoliator I really like
the consistency of this I really do feel
like it microderm the hell out of my
face I like to descent as well however
it did leave a residue on my face which
I thought was strange because I tried
using this before I would mask and it
just felt like my mask wouldn't sink
into the skin I tried using it in the
morning before my morning skincare but
again nothing would sink in after I
would use this so I would not personally
purchase a full size with this either
all right let's talk about some items I
have been loving this week the first is
my fragrance pairing for the week I have
been loving my Victoria's Secret total
attraction perfume paired with my soap &amp;amp;
Glory original pink body spray this one
has more of like a masculine scent and
this one smells really really sweet like
candy so when you pair them together
they actually smell like a high-end
perfume and I'm all about that life I
think they smell amazing I really have
been enjoying those alright I have been
loving my Too Faced love flush 16 hour
blush in the shade Baby Love this week
this definitely looks a little more
peachy on my particular skin tone but
this is the only blush I have been
wearing this week and I think it's
absolutely flawless and gorgeous and I
have been pairing that with the Wet n
Wild color icon bronzer with SPF 15
sunscreen in the shade 7:39 ticket to
Brazil and I've been loving this as well
so
is what it looks like it looks like it's
very orange and yellow we and it kind of
is but honestly and it's so finely
milled and it feels so nice on the skin
basically and it blends out so nicely
that I really really do like it if you
use this with a really really light
hands I think if you have fair skin
tones you would absolutely love this I
feel like it bronzes the skin up
beautifully it doesn't have chunks of
glitter in it it definitely has glitter
but it's like finely milled and it's
just a really beautiful color and I kind
of feel bad because on Monday and Shop
and swatch my stash I was like I know
I'm gonna hate this but I actually love
it so it's just one of those items like
don't judge a book by it's cover because
that has been awesome for me this week I
also have been loving my laura geller
bait gelato swirl illuminator in the
shade peach glow this is absolutely
gorgeous it is darker than my skin tone
but it's really really gorgeous it gives
me a lot of glow I have it on my
cheekbones today and I just think the
shade is absolutely stunning so this has
been a winner winner chicken dinner for
me this week as well I feel like the Too
Faced blessed be wet and wild bronzer
and then that's illuminator paired
together to succour just on the skin and
I just love the glow I have been getting
alright I have been loving at my Peter
Thomas Roth unwrinkle peel pads I
realized that last week I stopped using
these and I was having started ad break
off last week so I think the reason I
was breaking out so badly was not only
because of my period but also because I
wasn't using these so I am back to using
these twice a day they have a 20%
complex of Alpha Beta Gamma exfoliators
in them these are amazing what you do is
you apply them all over the face in the
morning and at night and then you wash
them off after about 60 seconds to 3
minutes depending on your skin type so I
leave them on for 3 minutes since I had
combo to oily skin and then you
neutralize the actual peel with water so
you can use them in the morning because
they won't make you Sun sensitive since
you do rinse the actual acid off of your
face but I love these so good for
decongest seeing the skin absolutely
absolutely amazing products I also have
been loving my ELF magic mat and mist
and set I think this is just so nice
it's so like refreshing during the day
to just spray this on your face but not
only that I really do feel like this
keeps my makeup nice and matte
and it does keep it in place all day
long I'm a big fan of drugstore like
mist and sets or drugstore extenders for
your makeup and I really think that the
elf ones are good so I've been loving
that I have some more skincare items I
have been loving so at nighttime I have
been pairing the two of these together
and this is the Kate Somerville derma
quench liquid lift retinol advanced
resurfacing treatment but this is
basically like your resurfacing
treatment foam that you put on your face
it literally sinks in in like 10 to 15
seconds it's amazing and I have been
pairing that with the pharmacy
what is the slave tide firming night
ball I really like this it isn't like
gel to oil center so it's kind of weird
you put your fingers in there and then
you rub it together on your hands and it
turns into an oil Tom is currently
making his way or working his way
through a full-size of this and I really
have been liking my deluxe eyes so I
really like the two of those together I
feel like you don't get a lot of residue
with this since it sinks in so quickly
so you can go in with the firming night
balm immediately after and they just
pair really really beautifully together
I do have some lip Perry's speaking of
Perry that I have been loving this week
and the first is the NYX soft matte lip
cream in the shade Istanbul paired with
the NYX butter gloss in the shade apple
streudel so the two of these together
are super super beautiful it's what I
have on my lips right now this dries
down matte and then this one has a nice
curly sort of glossy finish really
really pretty together I also have been
enjoying the Revlon just bitten kissable
balm stain in the shade of rendezvous
paired with these smashbox lip gloss in
the shade Coraline the two of these
together or coral and Coraline I don't
know I think it's Coraline but they're
really really pretty and I just love the
two shades together they give you kind
of like an orange pouty lip very very
beautiful together
and let's see here I have a lick whipped
body creme that I have been obsessed
with this week this is from the brand
philosophy this is the amazing grace
whipped body creme so I feel like
philosophy has a lot of sweet scents and
I love like their pink frosted animal
cracker they're what is it it's not
Island margarita some sort of margarita
senior vida margarita body wash but
honestly the amazing grey scent is so
beautiful it's a very perfumey scent
very sophisticated I love it and this
particular formulation is beautiful as
you can see I have almost used it up
completely I probably will be done with
this by the end of the month so you'll
probably see it in my empties video next
week but it's a beautiful beautiful
product it smells amazing
it leaves my skin feeling really moist
but not oily so I really have been
enjoying that at nighttime as far as
eyeshadow is concerned this week I have
been loving my NYX ultimate eyeshadow
palette in the brights version paired
with my makeup revolution ultra
professional eyeshadow palette in this
flawless matte version so these are
really bright I've been popping these on
my lower lash line I love the blend
ability the consistency the pigmentation
super super good quality and then I love
this makeup a revolution palette as well
this is absolutely beautiful you get
tons and tons of neutral shadows in here
brow bone colors so many transition and
blending shades just really really
beautiful if you really enjoy very very
neutral eye looks you need to get your
hands on this palette and I think it's
under $10 at Ulta so that has definitely
been a favorite for the week I also have
been enjoying my two Urban Decay 24/7
glide-on eye pencils in the shade
delirious which is the purple and
vacancy which is that beautiful teal
color I think that these pairs so nicely
with the next ultimate eyeshadow palette
I wear these on my waterline and then go
in with this on my lower lash line you
get a nice pop of color without looking
too in-your-face and crazy so I have
been enjoying those a lot let's see here
I have a hand cream I've been loving oh
my god that smells so good this is the
Andersen Lily Manhattan Beach Beach
butter hand cream this is the number
five sent in it's part of their coastal
collection I actually got this in my
glossy box last month it smells so good
you guys oh my god I can't even describe
the scent it smells like verbena and
like the beach side and sea salt it just
smells so good this is probably going to
be my go-to hand cream for the
summertime but it's really beautiful has
a lovely consistency sinks in really
really quickly as well so I've been
loving that and so my base this week I
have been pairing my smashbox
camera-ready BB water drops in the shade
fair with my Tarte trade pours of DC
aqua sealer in the shade at fair as well
these are both
serum or water foundation / concealers
they're very lightweight on the skin
they leave a beautiful finish this one
has more of like a tobacco cone feel to
it so you can actually blend this in
with your fingers I've just been wearing
one dropper full on my face this week it
does get very light coverage I would say
literally sheer - light coverage I mean
it's like literally it's really really
light coverage even lighter than a BB
cream but it's beautiful on the skin and
you do get the broad spectrum SPF 30
sunscreen in there to protect your face
and then the Tarte rainforest of the sea
aqua sealer I'm a huge fan of I think
it's beautiful on the skin I like to put
it underneath my eyes on my eyelids down
the bridge of my nose on my chin it's
really gorgeous for highlighting and it
has the same sort of consistency as the
Smashbox products alright as far as like
priming my face goes this week I have
been loving my Garnier five-second flirt
skin renew skin smoother this is one of
those products I've been trying to get
through for a while now and I'm almost
finished with it oh my goodness it just
popped out um I'm almost finished with
it this is so nice if you do have combo
or oily skin I think if you have dry
skin this may actually overemphasize
certain areas on your face and it may
kind of build up or not build up it may
ball up on your skin but if you do have
combo or oily skin this is so nice it
feels very similar to the pore fessional
so you could put it in your t-zone to
kind of just get like a nice base going
on there but yeah it's a beautiful
product I've been applying it all over
my face really keeps me matte throughout
the day so I have been loving that I
also have been loving the cocoa butter
formula with vitamin E swivel stick from
Palmer's I've been using this as my lip
balm this week it smells so good like
straight-up cocoa butter yeah just has
that really nice warm scent it looks
like a big like Elmer's glue container
but my lips have been really really good
this week and not super chapped at all I
think that the warmer weather is giving
me a little more or a little more oil in
my skin which in return is making my
lips a little more moist I know this
weird oily lips right but I really think
that just like the air and things like
that are a little more moist this time
of year
so I haven't been having superb added
like dry lips and I feel like this is a
really nice lightweight bomb it wouldn't
be amazing if you have super super dry
lips even though it does say it soothes
chapped lips I don't really think it
would do that but it's just a nice foam
to have an everyday bomb to wear
underneath your lip ease and things like
that let's see here what else oh my
mascara combination this week has been
on fleek in my opinion I loves me some
clumpy lashes so I have been loving
these smashbox
x-rated mascara wearing that on the
bottom paired with my voluminous miss
manga rock mascara from l'oreal the two
of these have a really rekt clumpy
formula i really like it i think it
makes your lashes look really defined
and pretty some people are not into that
look so i would stay away from either of
these if you don't like that but yes
they both have a really slick wet
formulation and they build nicely and
they definitely make your lashes look
very very defined i would say alright in
the morning i have been let's see here
moisturizing my face with the drunk
elephant to be Hydra intensive hydration
gel and then going in on top of it with
my josie maran 100% pure argan oil i
really do like this drug elephant
intensive hydration gel it's not the
best products from the drunk elephant
line or brands in my opinion i think
their vitamin c serum and also their
virgin marula oil are fantastic however
this is just okay however it is
something that i'm going to pick up in
full size because i think it's really
nice for the summer time especially for
those of you who do have combo or oily
skin it gives you just the right amount
of hydration it's cooling it doesn't
leave a constant like residue or weird
consistency on your face it's really
really beautiful and there is a product
at the drugstore that is very similar to
this it's called the Dr Lin hydrating
gel it's around seven or eight dollars
for a nice little tub of it now you
don't get a pump like you do with this
particular product um but you don't have
to like dig your fingers in but it
really has the same sort of consistency
and the same sort of effect on the skin
the reason I'm not going to pick up
another tub of that anytime soon is just
because it does have peppermint oil and
a few skin irritants in it so I didn't
want to get that one but I do think I
will pick this particular product up it
also has a vitamin b5 in it so really
kind of enriches your skin and
I just really like it so I'm going to
purchase a full-size of that and then
like I said I've been following up with
happy dropper full of my pure argan oil
this is a really wonderful moisturizing
oil from a josie maran you can use it in
your hair on your skin and I like to
combat my oil with oil during the
summertime so I've been enjoying this a
lot again only using about a third or
half a dropper full because if I use
more than that it will be too oily on my
skin that is not the light version it's
just the regular version all right what
else let's see here I think I have one
of our identity are good to go yes the
last item for the week that I have been
enjoying is the glam glow super mud
clearing treatment although I haven't
been loving the actual cleanser I think
this is amazing it really really is good
at decongestant your pores and breakout
it's just such a nice product if you do
have oily or combo skin so I've been
loving that alright guys those from a
fails and how the rails for the week I
hope you enjoyed this video thank you so
much for joining me and I will see you
guys tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
