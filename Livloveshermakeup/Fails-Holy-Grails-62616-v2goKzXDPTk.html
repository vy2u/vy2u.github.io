welcome back to my friends in jalapeños
where I share with you guys the products
that have been working for me this week
and the products that have not been
working for me this week so let's go
ahead and start with you know what why
don't we start with the Holy Grail
today we're gonna go with happy note
we're gonna start on a happy note
alright so the first item I've been
loving this week is my Too Faced peanut
butter jelly time peanut buddies a time
palette I love this thing it is so
awesome I've only had one bad eye look
this week and it was yesterday when I
attempted to use these shade of jamon
which has like a lot of chunky glitter
in there and then I over blended it and
it looks like someone punched me in the
face but overall I think this is a
beautiful palette I will be doing a
tutorial with it coming up in the next
couple of weeks so stay tuned for that
beautiful beautiful pigmentation warm
colors for the summertime love it
alright and the second item I have been
loving this week is the Peter Thomas
Roth The Rose stem cell bio repair gel
mask if you've been watching me for a
while you probably saw my top 5 series
on my face masks this is one of the top
5 it's a beautiful product
I've you store it in the refrigerator
and then I put it on my face they say
you can use a small layer as a
moisturizer it is quite tacky I like to
put just a big glop of it all over my
face leave it on for about 10 to 20
minutes and then rinse it off it's
absolutely stunning on the skin you guys
I feel like if you have dry skin aging
skin combo skin whatever you could use
this the biggest thing that I noticed
with it is that it softens my skin make
it feel it's like a little baby ass like
so nice and soft so really loved that
product I think that's right am I have
been loving is the covergirl clean matte
BB cream for oily skin the shade I have
is 510 fair I will have a first
impressions follow-up review coming up
on this product pretty soon it's just a
beautiful beautiful product it gives
great coverage my only complaint with
this is that there is no sunscreen in
here this is a BB cream a beauty bomb
they're supposed to be sunscreen so that
is kind of concerning
I just I didn't see anything like it
literally in the ingredients list I just
see a whole lot of DeMatha Kong but I
like the coverage I like the color I'm
just concerned as why you know I don't
know why I call it a BB cream if there's
nothing in there because the point of a
BB cream is that it's going to give you
a little bit of coverage and also sun
protection so that's kind of strange but
I happen to enjoy hearing that with the
Too Faced Born This Way naturally
radiant concealer in the shade of very
fair this is beautiful
the eyes I have two layers of it on
today you can you know use one or two
depending on how much coverage you need
it's beautiful really really love it
underneath the eye area it gives a very
satiny sort of glowy appearance to the
skin and I don't feel like it settles
into fine lines or wrinkles at all the
very fair shade is perfect it's like a
perfect color match for me and it's just
a beautiful product so I've been
enjoying that a lot I also haven't
enjoyed my soap Inglourious had food
sugar crush hydrating hand cream and
this is a blend of lemon and line and it
smells like brightness smells like you
have sprite on your hands and I really
like it I like the scent a lot so I do
like soap &amp;amp; Glory you guys know I've
been purchasing a lot of their stuff
recently not that they are on the alte
comm website and I think that this is
probably my second favorite scent from
them I'm next to clean on me or the
original pink like you know fragrance
from that so really enjoying that I'm
for highlighting this week I've been
using my tarts exposed highlight I love
this it's beautiful you can go really
heavy-handed with this like I did last
week and get super glowy skin I like to
use like a tapered highlighter brush for
that but for this week I've been using
it with a fan brush and just getting a
beautiful nice dusting of color along my
cheekbones it's stunning really really
highly recommend and I will be picking
one of those up for my 10,000 subscriber
giveaway all right the next couple of
items I want to talk about are lip
pairings so the first lip carry I'm just
like I liked it but I don't love it but
I still wanted to mention it it is the
urban decay matte revolution lipstick in
the shade in 1993 which is just a brown
color paired with the two-faced lip
injection glossy in the shade milkshake
so I feel like at this particular
plumping gloss although it does plump
but it doesn't give a lot of color I
felt like it just kind of broke down
this particular product so it looked
kind of like chunky and weird on my lips
so wasn't my favorite but the actual
combination looked very very pretty and
this shade looks very nice velocity
however I will say my favorite pairing
has definitely been my lime crema lip
velvetine in the shade Riots paired with
the Too Faced lip injection in bait
alert I have that honor right now this
has been my go-to this week a riot is to
say beautiful your lips but better color
and then babe alert is a warm coral so
really really enjoy that pairing and I
like the way that those two-faced lip
injections do plump up my lips although
they don't give a lot of color they do
plump alright ninis item I have been
I've only been using for a few days but
I'm obsessed and this is the fresh
Umbreon clay purifying facial toner and
I think this needs to go on the loves
list - it's so so so good and normally I
don't buy toners that are high-end I do
have one from nude it was Sakura fight
toning water I wouldn't repurchase it
was good but it wasn't amazing
that's $26 but I think that's really
expensive even like the pixi by petra
one that's super expensive I usually
just like to get drugstore toners
because you go through them so quickly
but I would definitely consider
purchasing this it makes you so freakin
matte and I think during the summer time
I would love it you do give it a good
shake at first and it does have like a
grayish color to it but I do like it a
really nice product
all right I've also been loving on my
tony moly kiss kiss lip balm in honey i
do prefer the blueberry wine but this
one still smells pretty good it kind of
smells like baby powder and honey and
it's just a really nice like thick
petroleum lip jelly and i like to wear
this at nighttime it really hydrates my
lips nicely and it leaves them
beautifully soft and then in the morning
I've been using my my fun side grape
soda
lip balm from lip smackers I feel like
lip smackers is really like underrated I
don't feel like these are great at like
hydrating your lips overnight but I feel
like underneath the makeup they go on
really nicely and they do prime well so
I've been enjoying that and I mean it
smells like grape soda I want to eat it
right all right and then I also have
been loving at my GLAAD low blow starter
mega illuminating moisturizer in the
shade nude below I'm going to be doing
it get ready with me video and I'm going
to share with you guys how I get glowy
skin even if I'm combo or oily skin this
is one of those products that are so
stunning if you do have come or oily
skin you can Glo with this without being
greasy or oily it actually has a really
really light kind of buttery like
consistency it sinks in almost
immediately and I think it's just
beautiful if you do have a dry skin or
aging skin I would recommend maybe going
in with like I don't know like argan oil
on top of it it might not be
moisturizing and not for you or you
could mix oil and but it's just
beautiful it smells like bubblegum
bubble gwandma
but not like bubblegum and it just
leaves a gorgeous kind of like
appearance to the skin and honestly I
would I would just wear this like I'm
like today where I'm really lazy I would
just wear this like it's so beautiful it
doesn't really cover anything but it
gives kind of like a soft focus effect
speaking of soft focus effects the
unbeaten makeup diamonds hearts based
primer in the illuminating version is
amazing this is a makeup aware extender
and also sort of like a smoothing primer
in one I love the way my skin looks
after applying this like literally I
could just apply this and put powder on
and it would look okay it really kind of
just blurs imperfections on your skin
and it really does make your makeup last
all day it didn't help with this
particular product which I will talk
about in a second but it definitely kept
on any car burger love BB cream alright
the next thing that I have been loving
are these two blushes blushes blushes
from Mac and also from tarts
the first one is sun bath from Matson
from Mac not matte from Mac this is a
sheer tawny shimmer blush and I like
this a lot I think these look beautiful
pair together and the other shade is
Tarte Amazonian clay 12-hour blush in
the shade seduced from their new Nadia
newest collection so this one definitely
has more of like a babi undertone and
this one's a little more warmer they
look a beautiful pair together that is
what I did today highly highly recommend
checking those out and then for brows I
have been enjoying this little
combination here I've been having really
sparse brows this week and I'll talk
about another product I've been enjoying
this week in a second but this is the
studio 10 Brown lip perfecting liner so
one side is like a highlighting pencil
fail but this side is the Holy Grail so
this is a really nice pencil it's kind
of dry but it's also moisturizing so
it's not going to slip and slide all
over but it's not gonna be super hard
like oh my god like I can't get it on
you know what I mean and then I have
been sending that in with the Milani
brow shaping clear wax which is one of
my favorites this thing is almost done a
really really good product if you want
to set your brows in without moving the
product sometimes when you use the gel
you can move what's underneath it the
Milani product doesn't do that so that's
awesome let's talk about some products
also for the brows and eyelashes so I've
been using my rapid brow again I
normally just will touch up and use this
when I need to but I have been using it
this week because my brows have been
looking a kind of shitty so I've been
using this I do think that this works
and it is worth the money
just my own opinion but yeah really nice
product I feel like it does kind of help
to thicken up what you already have I
don't know if it helps to make new like
eyebrow hairs actually grow but it just
makes them look thicker and denser like
over time and then I also have been
using mcCargo cosmetics lash activator
night and I will talk about why I've
been using this I've been using this
every single night which is crazy
normally I only use like lash
accelerating or nourishing products for
my lashes I only use them about once a
week because I've already built up you
know like that the length I want and
things like that and like I said one of
the fails for the week was really really
bad and made a lot of my eyelashes just
kind of disappear and fall out and
horrible so I've been using that every
single night it really kind of nourishes
your eyelashes it does leave them a
little crispy so you do want to use it
at nighttime but it's a good product and
it really does help with the health of
your lashes and also with thickness and
also it does help them grow alright and
now we're going to talk about the fail
so the first one would be Neutrogena
Healthy Skin the liquid makeup with
broad-spectrum titanium dioxide
sunscreen SPF 20 it has an antioxidant
blend it's in the shade classic ivory
listen this is the beautiful foundation
it looks absolutely stunning on the skin
don't get me wrong I just can't wear it
this time of year I held off on it and I
said oh I'm going to save that for
summer because it just it's a shade
darker than me that's so stupid do not
save your makeup like don't be like I'll
save it for the wintertime or the fall
or this or that just use it because I
can't wear this I'm just too oily during
the summer time to actually wear this so
I'll pull it back out during the fall or
winter and maybe just mix it with a
white mixer foundation and the second
fail has been the Becca ultimate
coverage concealing creme in the shade
praline I just don't like this any more
it really just does not give me a nice
looking skin it's very very humectant
and it's somehow now is just oily on my
skin but it's also dry it used to be
beautiful and I don't know if it's
because I'm just getting older I'll be
24 soon I don't know if it's just
because like the texture on my face is
getting different or I was more dry or
oily last time I used it but I love this
when I was like 18 and 20 and now I'm
just not into it I will declutter this
it might take clutter series in October
and then the last product and I don't
even have it to show you because I put
it in my empties been already
there's a huge piece of it is the
Tarte lights camera lashes mascara man I
really wish I had not tried that out
this week I tried removing it with
everything you guys that's that
stays on if you really don't mind like
the condition of your lashes you want a
mascara to stay on you can check that
one out but you really really just took
a lot of my lashes this week and the
reason it took my lashes was not because
of the formulation it's just because
it's so waterproof so I guess it is the
formulation it's so waterproof and I
just couldn't get it off I couldn't get
it off I would wake up every morning and
I would have excess residue of products
like residual makeup underneath my eye
and I was pulling and tugging and my
under eye area looks like crap this week
and my eyelashes look like crap I tried
with coconut oil I tried with I was
gonna say coconut milk maybe that would
work too I tried coconut oil
I tried be two-faced at mascara and melt
off I tried that again it didn't work
for that I tried the Mario Badescu and
non oily makeup remover gel I tried
makeup wipes nothing I can't get the
 off so I did toss it and today for
the first time I went ahead and I used
something else I should have done this
like halfway through the week I just
wanted to keep trying it you know but
this is the Physicians Formula sexy
booster cat eye mascara and I do it like
this one it's from the cat eye
collection and it just feels like a nice
volume to the lashes because I didn't
want to put anything too heavy or thick
on my lashes today cuz I'm scared
they're just gonna break off more so
that was really really disappointing I
hate that product do not get the lights
camera splashes if you want to have nice
eyelashes alright guys well thank you so
much for joining me uh oh I was gonna
say shop and swatch my stash now thank
you for joining me from the frozen
haunted rails and I will see you guys
tomorrow for shop and swatch my stash</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
