thank you so much for joining me I hope
you were all having a fantastic sunday
as usual this video probably won't be up
until real late tonight because I just
woke up from a nap and it's like 5 or 6
p.m. when I'm filming this right now so
if my eye makeup looks a little smudgy
or if my hair looks like a mess it's cuz
i just woke up from a nap and I just
wanted to say really quickly that is
what I have been doing for the past two
to three days I've just been sleeping in
and resting and that's pretty much all
I've been doing so I know a few of you
were a little concerned because I've
been a little m.i.a please don't be i
really do appreciate you guys giving me
a little bit of time and space i
honestly have not been on any sort of
social media outlet I've not been
watching videos I've not been making
videos I have not been answering
comments I'm not been on snapchat I have
not been on Instagram I haven't been
anywhere and I really have just been
hanging out and just kind of sleeping in
and just giving myself what I need it if
that makes sense really just kind of
nurturing myself I'm not sick or
anything like that I just have not been
feeling great so that's what I've been
doing the past couple days I just wanted
to put that out there in case you guys
have been worried but I will be back
tomorrow for shop and swatch my stash
and of course we are filling this video
today while my hair is like real hot
mess over here hot messy um but there
was something else I wanted to say oh
yes I'm miss talking to you guys so
please let me know down in the comments
section when you guys have been up to
this week and I would love to get back
to you guys and we can have little
conversations alright so let's move on
to the pails and how to Wales the first
I know I'm going to share is the fail
for the week this is the bath and
Bodyworks know nope this is the soap and
glory orange gasm wait orange orange add
some orange awesome zesty fresh and
revitalizing body wash so I picked us up
at Alta and I was really excited for it
I love the clean on me body wash this
was like eight dollars and fifty cents
such a great deal when I sniff it like
this when I just open the cap and take a
good whiff of it it smells really good
when I'm putting it on in the shower it
smells like a rubbing grass all over my
body I mean literally it's tues st and
to revitalizing i want more orange in
and just less like grassy notes so I'm
not really a fan of the sentence I would
not repurchase but the formulation is
nice so I will use it up completely now
let's talk about some of the Holy Grails
the first one is definitely this toner
I've been loving this this is the nude
purify toning water it has cardamom and
cinnamon cinnamon in it yes I'd say
that's right cinnamon and cardamom yes
and those are really really nice for
like anti-inflammatory like they have
anti-inflammatory properties than them
so if you do have congested skin oily
skin problematic skin break out prone
skin you would love this toner it does
have a pump which is great super super
easy and I just put it right onto a
cotton pad to rub it all over my face
and that's what i've been using in the
morning and at night time and since i
have been so busy and just exhausted
pretty much the whole week / the whole
month i have been going in this week
with just overnight masks so I haven't
been doing a whole big thing on you know
like skin care routines at nighttime I
basically have just been using the
purify Tony water and then I go in with
one of these overnight sleeping facials
/ masks so the first one is the origins
drink up intensive overnight mask this
helps to quench your skin's thirst it
smells amazing i love the consistency
and it is very very humectant and
moisturizing it just locks the moisture
into your skin you wake up and your skin
looks absolutely beautiful and I feel
like when you don't get enough sleep you
just look like 10 years older than what
you are you know what I mean like you
really just look kind of Haggard and
everything just looks really over it
overly emphasized like fine lines and
wrinkles underneath your eyes and
everything just looks a lot worse so I
feel like when I am really tired the
best thing I can do is just pop on an
overnight mask and leave that on
overnight and then the other little
overnight mask that I have been enjoying
I actually got in my support play box
last month and I know I didn't do an
unboxing for that but i will be doing
one this month but this is the Korres
wildrose advanced brightening sleeping
oil and i wanted to see if i had it over
here you guys know have a huge fan of
the vitamin c brightening oil so this is
the same sort of sense I feel like it's
really nice on this
in if you have really really dry
dehydrated skin i recommend the origins
one but this one is so nice if you do
have like combo or oily skin it's
beautiful and I feel like my skin does
look a lot brighter and just like more
even toned when I wake up in the morning
so I'm gonna enjoy those at night time
for my skincare routine I do have a body
wash that I have been enjoying so after
I wasn't really enjoyed this I kind of
switched to this one and then I started
using this at my shaving cream this is
the rituals sensation organic rice milk
and cherry blossom foaming shower gel
sensation so this is basically just a
foaming body wash and like I said I've
kind of been used to get to shave my
legs it smells amazing like really good
you I just got like water all over me
it's been in the shower but it smells
really really good it's got a really
nice sort of cherry blossom fresh scent
to it and I really really have been
enjoying this a lot the next item I have
been enjoying this also kind of skin
care related is the Jersey Shore spa
anti-aging lip and hand polish in the
vanilla bean sent so i actually got this
where did I get this that was weird i
was like and i believe like my january
epsy bag or something like that it's
really really beautiful it smells really
nice kind of smells like a chai latte
like spicy vanilla or something like
that it smells really good I like the
oils in there it really helps to kind of
get all of the dry skin off of your
hands and your lips but then it also
like leave some moisturize so I'm
enjoying that a lot this week actually
keep this in my shower and as far as
foundation is concerned this week I have
been loving a mine ours velvet matte
skin tint with broad-spectrum SPF 30
sunscreen I've just like a nice light
layer of this on my skin today and the
shade that I am in is a Terran lab a
light 0 so this is what it looks like
and I just loved the Demi matte finish
that this leaves on my skin I think it's
really beautiful and I do love that it
has lots and lots of sun protection in
there as well and i have been carrying
that with this particular concealer that
i never reached for this is the cover
girl Ready Set gorgeous concealer this
is in the
lightest shade which I believe is called
fair and I just never use this I never
really liked to be like doe foot
applicator but honestly it just deposits
the smallest amount of color right where
you need it I don't like this for
covering blemishes I only put it right
underneath my eyes and on my eyelids and
I feel like it gives a little bit of
brightness without looking super cakey
and overdone so I've been loving the two
of those pair together the NARS Velvet
Matte with the covergirl Ready Set
gorgeous which I'd just opened and got
all right cap oh but I really like the
two of those together they give a very
beautiful sort of satin me look to the
skin I do have a foot cream here that I
have been obsessed with this is the
Bliss ala lys plus peppermint foot
patrol like I said I've just been very
tired which means that my feet have been
very tired from just walking around very
very achy sore feet I love this it has a
chaise in it it's got exfoliating at
properties and softening properties like
shea butter and things like that in it
as well and glycerin and what I like
about it the most is that it has tea
tree oil in it and if you have never put
tea tree oil on your feet you really
should because it just feels so nice
it's very very good at relieving tension
and like muscle aches in your feet it
just feels really really good so I've
been enjoying this a lot I just put you
know two big globs of this on my feet
and then I rub it in and put sauce on
overnight I do have a mascara that I've
been wearing all week it's been my Urban
Decay perversion mascara love this
beautiful beautiful formulation it has a
huge natural bristle wand and a really
really wet slick formula so if you are
not into that you probably wouldn't like
this but I like the way that this layers
and builds on its own so really really
good mascara I have been obsessed
obsessed with my pharmacy lip bloom oh
my gosh so the one that I picked up is
in strawberry basil it smells really
good it's just got a beautiful glossy
consistency to it I just love this I
would just like put this on my lips all
day long and I like that they haven't
been super super dry and horrible so I
use this during the day I use it at
night
and like i said i have these strawberry
basil sent really really good products
really been enjoying that a lot and then
the final product well the final two
products i want to talk about the first
is the body shop Satsuma body sorbet
I've been obsessed with this it smells
so good and I love the body sorbet
formulation because it is a lot lighter
than just a normal like lotion or a body
cream and the Satsuma sent it just makes
me happy if you love anything citrusy
you need to smell the Satsuma sent from
the body shop it's absolutely amazing
and then the final item i have been
loving is the NYX baked blush +
illuminator in the shade fetish I have
this on today all you need is a tiny
little bit like on the apples of your
cheeks and it looks amazing so those are
all mobiles and Holly grails for the
week I know I didn't have that many but
again I've just been kind of a basic
bitch this week kind of like last week
but I hope you guys enjoyed this video
thank you so much for joining me and I
will see you guys tomorrow for shop and
Squatch my stash bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
