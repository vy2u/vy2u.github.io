Wales I'm sharing about my weekly
favorites breathe you guys this week
that really didn't come out right I'm
showing my weekly favorites with you
guys today
there we go I said it all right and I'm
also gonna share the products that did
not work out for me so let's start with
those because they really suck the first
one is the origins Maximizer this is a
skin optimizing mask primer I will be
doing a video called products I'm
returning which I feel like is gonna be
controversial I saw my friend Kristin
Kay do a video like that and I actually
still have all the products that I want
to return and literally going to film a
video show you guys the products that
returning deli tell you why I'm
returning them and then go over turn
them and I feel like it might be kind of
controversial cuz people will be like
why would you share something like that
but I think it's helpful let me know
down below if you think it's helpful I
will be making a video on that and this
is one of the items they will be
returning this just doesn't work it's
supposed to be am like optimizing mask
primer so basically you spray this on
your face which by the way it burns your
face off it had alcohol in it so
weirdest thing you spray on your face
before you put your mask on it's just
supposed to help with the absorption of
the mask that you put on top it did
nothing it just did nothing I spent like
$22 for a bottle of alcohol
alright moving on the second item that
did not work out for me this week is
actually a makeup product it is the
chart smooth operator Amazonian clay
finishing powder it's just a little
deluxe sized sample that I got when I
ordered some of my rainforest of the sea
collection I will I mean I will use this
up I just don't I will not repurchase
this I mean I don't even think I
purchased this this was like a free item
with the stuff that I bought but I will
use it up I just don't like it because
it's not the bye-bye pores from it
cosmetics that is amazing is the best
silica powder ever if you guys watch my
declutter series you saw the eye
decluttered every single like setting
powder that had like silica in it or
like HD powder like the NARS one that
elf one I do cluttered all of them
except for the it cosmetics cuz it's
that good so yeah that's just that that
one does not compare alright now let's
talk about some stuff that I've been
loving this week the first is the tree
hot shade sugar scrub in the marula and
Jasmine scent girl this smells so good
it smell amazing can never open this
piece of crap ah okay I can't open it
just take my word for it it smells
really really nice I've used it I think
three times this week which is a lot but
I've been using it on my feet especially
because my feet have been looking just
horrible like really ugly so I've been
using it on my feet on my hands it
smells amazing and I love the
formulation about the shade sugar scrubs
so that it's my first holy grail the
second holy grail is the bubble bath I
have been using I love this this is the
Bath and Body Works bubble bath this is
the carried away scent can we just take
a moment look at that packaging like yes
I just want to be carried away by
balloons and flowers I want that all
right it's a carried away is a whimsical
blend of luster raspberries white
jasmine and whipped vanilla inspired by
the way love sweeps you off your feet I
love it it really smells good and it
thinks really soft luxurious bubbles I
feel like I see that every single week
but literally it makes a really really
nice soft luxurious bubble so I really
really love that all right and then the
next thing I've been loving is my
fragrance duo for the week off so guys
let me just yeah yeah yeah all right so
it is the Victoria's Secret strawberries
and champagne fragrance mist paired it
with the versace bright crystal perfume
I don't know if I've talked about this
pairing before but I think I said if
Barbie were to wear a perfume it would
be this one I'm not even kidding like it
smells like Barbie but she would love
this duo okay it smells so good you get
a little bit of sweetness with the
strawberries and champagne and then you
also get a little bit of bubbliness from
like the champagne in there and then the
Versace a bright crystal just smells
like just smells like Legally Blonde
Barbie you know anything like just I
don't even know it just smells amazing
it's so bright and fun and flirty and
cute and it's just amazing the two of
those together aren't amazing how many
times can I say it me me all right oh my
god I've been loving this st. Ives
blackhead clear in green tea scrub and
clears blackheads and calms redness it's
got salicylic acid in at 1% which is
pretty darn good I love this this is
really really nice it kind of microderm
to your face so if you are looking for a
scrub that has really really small
exfoliating beads that will actually
really like buff away dead skin and
actually texture on your skin I highly
recommend looking into this one it has
the same sort of formulation as the pink
grapefruit and like mandarin orange one
as well so if you like that like you
know particles like if you like the
small little exfoliating particles
one you would love this one and this one
just has green tea in it it smells
really good love it it is green but yeah
super cute let that alright moving on
I've been loving my Neutrogena
hydraboost water gel with hyaluronic
acid this is one of my all-time favorite
moisturizers my god like literally do I
just have to tighten everything to the
extreme where I cannot you can open it
oh my god okay I can open it it's
amazing it has hyaluronic acid in it
it's got a really bouncy liquidy formula
to it so if you have oily skin or condo
skin you are going to love this because
it will not leave your skin oily or you
won't have any residue on it whatsoever
I highly highly recommend checking this
out if you do have oily or combo skin
I've been wearing that in the morning
I've been wearing this hoping glory hand
food this is the sugar crushed hydrating
hand cream I am NOT dealing with as much
like what is it I don't want to say
psoriasis like eczema sort of psoriasis
dryness on my wrist in hands so I have
switched back into like my heavily
fragrance not so hydrating hand cream
this does hydrate a little bit but it
sinks then immediately I've been
carrying around in my purse and it has a
like lemon-lime sort of scent to it and
I love anything lemons limes
speaking of lemon lime and my favorite
little lip product this week has been
this lip smacker in the sprite formula
yes this is sprite and sprite is my
favorite um it really does smell like
sprite it smells like lemon lime and
it's bright it's my favorite soda so I
love this and you know what I feel like
lip smackers are so like not talked
about on YouTube these hydrate your lips
insanely well so I love that I also have
been loving at night I'm wearing my
Shiseido Ibuki multi solution gel which
helps with roughness on your skin it
does have salicylic acid in it and don't
know how much but it's got a lovely
amazing consistency of like this gel
that kind of just forms back into itself
so if you push it it just kind of like
it conforms back into itself it's really
really lightweight I love it on my skin
it's been helping with fine lines it's
been helping with texture it's been
helping with breakups it's been helping
with everything so I have been wearing
this and then topping it at nighttime
with it the first date beauty ultra
Repair hydro front sleeping cream I love
this from first aid beauty really
luxurious texture really really
moisturizes my skin and it's just a
fantastic product
love those too but for eyeshadow this
week I've been loving my Stila trust and
love gift set this was a limited edition
palette that was released during the
holiday collection holiday season
holiday collection holiday season and
you've got a mascara in here a lip gloss
I don't have those in there this week
but then you have 12 gorgeous eyeshadows
I've been wearing these all week they're
beautiful they're very very luxurious
like the texture is like so buttery and
soft
I love these three shades right here
paired together they're just beautiful
and today I am wearing that sheet right
there in my crease I have that on my lid
and that on the inner corner and then
this as my transition shade which is
like the perfect transition shade is
just amazing and I just really love this
palette I feel like it gives very very
natural beautiful like dawn makeup and
not like overdone is that make sense so
yeah I've been really really enjoying
this just gorgeous 12 gold gorgeous
couch 12 gorgeous shades in there
alright sorry guys I'm a little hyper I
did have a latte today so sorry if I'm
just talking super fast alright moving
on I love this pixi by petra makeup
fixing this this has rosewater and green
tea I use this as a primer after I put
my primer on and then I also use it as a
setting spray
it's got soft focus effect to it so
there's a little bit of like gleam I'm
not gonna say shimmer and glitter
because there's no shimmer or glitter
but a little bit of a gleam to it it's
just absolutely love lovely it says all
over setting mist prolongs makeup and
from it moving melting or setting and
also protects the skin and yeah it has
like a soft focus sort of look to it
really really cool love this and I'm
almost through with it I would
repurchase and then I've been loving
this for removing my eye makeup I want a
full size of this this is the chlorine
floral eye makeup remover I thought
because this is so heavily fragrance
that it would irritate my eye area but
it doesn't at all what I really like is
that it has the consistency of like in
my cellar water so it's not going to
leave any oily or greasy residue on your
eye area a really really awesome product
I really want to get a full-size of this
I'll have to go onto my loves list after
this and put that on there alright
actually I've been loving the YSL this
is the pop water glossy stain in the
shade dewy red I love this so much it's
luxurious look at the packaging it
smells like roses it just leaves a
beautiful stain on your lips I put it on
about five hours ago and now the stain
is just there but it's super glossy and
beautiful and I just love that color and
then the other lip product I've been
loving this week is the it cosmetics
agenda snake watt which is just one of
those your lips but better sort of
products it basically just heats up on
the it heats up on your lips it's very
hard to describe the pH like basically
heats up on your lips and then it turns
like a pretty pinky pouty color I don't
really know how to describe it I feel
like the big claim it looks different on
everybody I feel like it looks similar
on people I think there is like a base
color in there somewhere but it just
makes a beautiful pinky peachy little
baby lip color
alright moving on I have been loving my
formula 1006 deep down detox ultra
cleansing but masks like I said I have
been carrying this with the origins
Maximizer and yeah that really does
nothing but this does something I really
love this umm if you are somebody who
has like breakouts and you want to
decongest your pores without drying your
skin this is amazing I've used a lot of
it up I feel like I don't even have that
much left maybe like this half but it's
amazing it really doesn't dry down too
much to the point where you can't move
your face kind of like some mud mask
and it will completely decongest your
pores pull out the crap but it doesn't
drive down completely so it's amazing I
love it and I think you can get that for
under $5 at Ulta and then the next thing
I've been loving is my bare minerals
skin longevity vital power infusion I
feel like I talked about this last week
as well I'm sorry I just can't stop
talking about it it's so good this is
what I've used in the morning as my
serum it's just got the best consistency
ever it is so liquidy and milky and
amazing and hopefully you guys can see
that it's so lightweight if you have
oily skin or combination skin you would
love this it's kind of really
unoffensive smell kind of like lemon
juice it's just amazing like literally I
think everybody would love this it
moisturizes my skin but not to the point
where it's going to leave me greasy or
oily so I really love that as far as
foundation goes again
this is a repeat from last week my Josie
Maran vibrancy foundation fluid this has
quickly become one of my favorite
foundations of all time it is so good
the shade I have is dynamic it's got
argan oil in here it's just luxurious
got a nice pump beautiful little trippy
bottle I love it it's just amazing so
yeah this has definitely been a favorite
and then underneath that foundation I
have been going in with one of my
correctors this week and I've been using
the Smashbox color correcting stick in
the look less tired dark shade or the
orange cream shade it looks like this
and I have been using that underneath my
eyes in the morning before I put my
foundation on and that is what it looks
like a color corrects any blue tones
that you have underneath your eyes and
then I'll put my foundation on and then
I've been going in with my benefit
dandelion shy beam this is a matte
liquid highlighter it is beautiful
because it's got this pinky peachy sort
of color to it so it kind of color
corrects it's not like it's a concealer
or anything like that it does come like
this it has a little bit of a flimsy
little applicator I don't really like
the applicator but a really really
beautiful color and it really does
highlight the face so I put that
underneath in the little triangle I put
it on my chin I put it down my nose I
put it on the what is this little kitten
spot yes I put it on the key thirds ball
I put it everywhere and it's beautiful
it blends in really nicely it's almost
like a correcting product so yeah the
shy beam from dandelion I have been
using that on top of my foundation and
then I have been using my one of my
favorite eye creams ever this is the yes
to grapefruit dirt dark circle
correcting eye cream in the morning but
having lots of dark circles this week
haven't been gained enough sleep at all
all right as far as eyeliners are
concerned I've been loving the NARS
larger than life long wear eyeliner in
via veneto this is super creamy super
blendable and I am wearing it today but
it just not like transfer on my
waterline whatsoever so I love it I also
have been loving my NYX eye and eyebrow
pencil and SPE 906 white and I've been
wearing that when I look really tired in
the morning on my waterline for
contouring my face this week I've been
loving my Too Faced cocoa contour kit
they did recently release a darker shade
of this so if you are really really deep
dark skinned but you can definitely get
that new one that looks like it is
really nice and chocolatey but I have
been using mostly this shade right here
which is called medium cocoa to contour
my face it's beautiful a little Ashley
perfect love it so yeah I've really only
been using that one shade in there but I
do love that kit and then I want to say
oh my gosh one of my subscribers
Alessandra I believe that's how you say
her name she told me she sent me a video
on Instagram of her kind of life she
basically wiped off the top layer of her
what is this skin twinkle lighting
palette from Tarte so this was like a
new item that came in the Tarte
reinforce of this tea collection and
that middle shade right there was just
horrible like it was so gross and now
it's so buttery and smooth because she
told me to go ahead and kind of get off
the top layer so you guys can see like
I've got like a hole in that thing like
I really got in there and now it's so
smooth and creamy and amazing so if
you've got a bad batch like I did I
heard some people didn't but if yours
has a weird like layer on the top go
ahead and do what Alessandra did and
just like to take off the top layer
thank you so much for that by the way I
love you girl but she recommended I do
that and yeah I'm loving this palette so
I've been highlighting with moonlight
and sunlight this week I put moonlight
on first and then sunlight on top and I
do that all over the areas where I wanna
highlight especially the cheekbones love
it absolutely beautiful and then as far
as blush is concerned I've been loving
my Lancome blush some teal palettes if
you have never tried these they're
amazing they have a blush a contour and
also kind of like a highlight in there I
don't really use the contour of the
highlight but the blushes are amazing so
this particular one is called 1:26 and
nectar lace and then this one right here
is called 3:23 rose flush these are
beautiful blushes just absolutely
gorgeous so I've been loving those and
then I've been going in all over my face
after I'm done with my makeup and using
my Too Faced no filter selfie powders
and a lot of you have been saying that
my skin looks very glowy this week it's
because I've been using the totally
toasted shade right there and I just put
it all over my face after I'm done with
my makeup and I won't really want to
glow like I know
and very pale but I like to glow so
that's my way of flowing without being
too overdone and then as far as mascara
a lot of you have been asking to what
I've been wearing this week it is the
Maybelline the falsies push-up drama
just two coats of this amazing love this
and then for primer I've been loving my
Too Faced hangover RX all over my face
and my benefits Air Patrol eyelid primer
those are both really really nice and
hydrating and just lovely on the skin my
skin has felt a little irritated this
week so those are very calming and just
feel very good and they do prolong the
wear of your makeup for setting
everything in I've been loving my
essence all about that fixing compact
powder I have already a pan and I got
this a week ago I mean the last product
that I have been loving is my Olli
Henriksen ultimate lift HL I feel like
this is one of those eye creams that
actually does something and I have tried
so many eye creams and I'm like and they
don't really do anything different than
what a regular moisturizer would do for
your face but I have so many that I need
to go through so I'm like alright I
might as well use them up this is
amazing it's got a very very thick
sticky tacky gel so I recommend using it
at night plus I also does have I believe
a little bit of a chase in there so you
don't want to wear it during the day
unless you wear sunscreen but it's
amazing I just feel like my eyes look
like lifted like I got a little eye lift
or something in the morning like it
looks amazing my eyes don't look super
puffy not tons of dark circles just been
loving this this is a really good eye
cream I will purchase a full-size of
that when I am done with it alright guys
so those were muffins and the holograms
for the week I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and I shall see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
