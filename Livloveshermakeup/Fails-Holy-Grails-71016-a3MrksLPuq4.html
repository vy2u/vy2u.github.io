welcome back to my Bridal sinhala
granules where I share with you guys the
products I have been loving this week
and the products that I have not been
loving this week I am makeup list today
I was just not in the mood to put on
makeup today or yesterday for that
matter so anyway I am barefaced what
other announcements do I have nothing
else to say so let's go ahead and get
into the Bilson moly growls we are going
to start with the failed as usual since
they like to end things on a happy notes
the first fail for the week is this
Oprah pressed powder oil control so this
is an oil control pressed powder this is
what it looks like you guys this thing
is complete like complete I
got this in my I think it was last month
yeah last month boxycharm box and you
guys I was like okay it's just gonna be
an oil absorbing powder it's going to be
completely transparent and just like not
chalky and beautiful but it's not it's
completely white it is chalky it's gross
it makes your face look even more whites
and you guys know I've already pale as
hell like the last thing I wanted to
look even more pale and on top of that
you guys it's just so chalky it has a
rough consistency to it I felt like it
actually had little bits of micro
shimmered in there which ended up making
me look a little greasy err than usual
and it was just a bad powder so I'm
going to have to declutter that and just
let that go because that powder was a
total fail alright a second um mascara
or the second item I haven't been liking
is this mascara it is called the
emoticon allowed icono me de la no
mascara it's not that I don't it's not
like I hate this like hate hate hate it
it's just isn't really that great of a
mascara I got this in one of my
subscription boxes again the last month
and it has a nice wand again if you've
been watching me for a while you know
that I don't really like these natural
bristle wands I do prefer a flubber wand
because I feel like I really can get
into all the little areas that I need to
and normally they're a little more pokey
and spiky and they create more spider
lashes which I personally like but this
was just okay I've used it as my base
mascara this week but it was nothing
impressive and I will probably go ahead
and let that go at some point because it
really wasn't that great and then the
final fail for the week is the Smashbox
photo finish foundation primer light
I used to like this a lot and it's not
that it's not a good product it's just
this one has gone bad it completely
smells like Elmer's glue like it just
the scent is off the texture started to
separate so I'm gonna have to go ahead
and declutter this as well but overall
it is quite nice if you were looking for
one of these Smashbox primers and you
want one that is good for combo to oily
skin but you still want a little bit of
Dometic hone and slip like you know so
that you can rub it onto your face and
it just goes on really nicely I would
highly recommend checking that one out
alright let's go ahead and get into the
Holy Grail so the first Holy Grail is
the soft soap coconut butter a body
scrub I love this this stuff smells so
good you guys they also have a
strawberry one oh my god it just smells
like coconut frosting like it's so good
I really really like this I remember
when I traveled to Italy I brought this
as my three-in-one product as my body
scrub I used it to moisturize kind of my
body like you know like a moisturizing
body wash and then also what else did I
use it for Oh shaving like it's great
it's just a great three-in-one product
this is what it looks like like I said
you can get the strawberry one as well
it smells really really good I just love
this I've been using it as a body wash
and also a scrub this week and it
definitely has been a Holy Grail the
next Holy Grail has been this little
Vaseline lip therapy this is a tiny
little tub of the rosy lips version
which is for soft pink lips and I love
this stuff now if you are not a fan of
petroleum jelly obviously you don't want
to get this little Vaseline tab but I
love this one it smells really really
faintly of roses it has a beautiful pink
color to it so it does make your lips
look kind of rosy and pink and I just
feel like Vaseline really does lock in
the moisture overnight and of course
that's because it has petroleum jelly in
it I don't wear this during the day I
just wear it at nighttime if you do want
something that's similar to petroleum
jelly like the same sort of consistency
and it will do the same thing without
having petroleum jelly you can pick up
the Alba Botanica lund petroleum jelly I
swear it's like the same exact thing if
you are sensitive to petroleum jelly or
for some reason you just don't want to
use that ingredient but I really like
this one I have the little mini rose one
and I also have
the cocoa butter formula they're both
amazing all right as far as blush is
concerned this week I've been loving
might artist blush palette it is a clay
blush palette if this is the outside
packaging you guys probably remember me
doing a review on this my favorite color
in here is this one right here it's
called lib and it's just absolutely
gorgeous that has been my go-to color
all week it's a bright coral you also
have laughs which is a gorgeous kind of
Mavi nude color with tons of glitter in
it and then you have love which is just
basically a nude blush here and then the
last one that you have is dream which is
like a cool toned pink moppy color I
love this palette I love the formulation
I think it's absolutely stunning and
very very compact and easy for travel so
really have been enjoying that for my
lip piece this week I have been loving
liquid lipsticks and I shouldn't say
that I've been loving liquid lipsticks
because guys in general I don't really
love liquid lipsticks but I have been
putting glosses on top of these liquid
lipsticks and I feel like they've made
them a little more wearable for me
personally so the first one I've been
loving is the Kat Von D Suspiria liquid
lipstick it is just a beautiful purple
color and I have been layering that with
these stealin lip glaze in the shade
Glory and a lot of you were wondering
what my lip combo was when I was wearing
that purple lip this week it has been
this combo I love the way that the two
of those look together you guys just saw
those so stunning very juicy it looks
they can't like grape soda on your lips
I love it and I also have been enjoying
my NYX liquid suede a liquid lipstick or
cream lipstick in the shade Dashon Rose
which is a hot hot hot pink color and
again I like to top that with glory or
just put any sort of clear balm on or
even like a lip oil just so that the
formulation is a little more comfortable
for me to wear alright I'm moving on for
my brows this week I thought a
combination that I really like actually
I feel like this really makes my brows
look thick and even though it makes them
look slightly disheveled it just makes
them look very thick and nice and to
shovelled I hope you guys know what I'm
doing today so I've been enjoying using
my Maybelline brow drama cram pomade in
the lightest shade and then I have been
topping that with this brow gel that I
got in my boxycharm last month this is
the brow gal by Tania crooks this is the
clear water-resistant eyebrow gel
I really feel like this locks in my
brows all day but at the same time what
I like to do with this is push my brow
hair up and I feel like it just makes my
brows look very um not really maintains
but it makes them look a lot thicker so
I really begin to that look this week
really been join that a lot I do have a
concealer here that I have been loving
it is the Maybelline master conceal by
face studio in the shade number ten
affair I love this underneath the eyes
you guys especially because I have been
using color correctors this week but
also this is great because this
particular shade runs a little more on
the yellow tone so it really helps to
cancel out any dark circles I've been
enjoying that a lot and the foundation I
have been loving is the Laura Mercier
candle glow soft luminous foundation in
the shade shell so let me know if you
guys would like to see a whole video
dedicated to my favorite water
foundations or like a top 5 series on my
favorite serum or water foundations this
is one of them it's a beautiful
beautiful lightweight consistency and it
goes onto the skin really nicely I know
a few of you were asking me if I'm going
to pick up the new face and body water
foundation from wait these the body is
from Mac but I think makeup forever just
came out with one the answer is no I'm
not gonna get that just because they do
have so many water and serum based
foundations but this is one of my
all-time favorites again let me know if
you would like to see a top 5 series
video on maps because they're very very
nice and lightweight to wear during the
summer time especially if you do have
copper or oily skin and this one is just
beautiful it gives a really really nice
soft sheen to the skin and I feel like
it has a very satiny finish to it so I
really really do love this my only
complaint is there's not a whole lot of
coverage in there but again with the
serum foundation or a water foundation
you're not getting tons of coverage now
I have been using some color correctors
this week these were the first color
correctors I ever tried out these are
the Becca backlight targeted color
correctors
and they used to be my favorite because
again they were the first ones I ever
tried out I still think they are really
really nice you guys but I definitely
have new favorites and when my declutter
series rolls around in the fall and they
ends up getting rid of these but it's
not because they're not good it's just
because I don't
like I need 27 color correctors in my
collection but the first raid I was
using was papaya this is absolutely
stunning underneath the eyes to cancel
out dark tones but you do need to
sometimes follow up if you are wearing a
very lightweight foundation you do need
to follow up with a concealer over it
now if you're just wearing like a medium
to full coverage foundation you actually
don't need one it really really covers
nicely but it just depends on how much
of this you use but I've been using that
underneath my eyes to cancel out blue
tones and then I really like the violet
shade now the violet shades of color
correctors some people are like they're
so pointless but they're really nice for
filling in fine lines and wrinkles and
also just for brightening the skin so
you can put them underneath your brow or
on top of your brow bone really really
beautiful I personally really like this
one and I do find it very very
brightening and then the last shade was
pistachio pistachio have been a
lifesaver for me this week I just got
out of the lupus flare up and I've been
left with a lot of redness and I really
like this one because it's not too dark
green it really is that nice creamy
pistachio color so I've been enjoying
those color correctors quite a bit
although they aren't my favorite color
corrector they have been really good for
me this week all right
I do have a primer here that I've been
loving for my eyes it is the stay don't
stray in the light flash medium shade
from benefit I am falling more and more
in love with this every time I use it
this is what it looks like and what I
like about this the most you guys is the
fact that it has a duo foot applicator
now it used to just come out like in a
pump but this literally I feel like this
helps with creasing and things like that
it's not too tacky it's not too DeMatha
cone-like or silicone like and but it
just doesn't dry down tacky or sticky
ever but I think my favorite part is
that it actually conceals the under eye
area and also like your actual eyelid
but then it makes sure that like you're
you know shadows don't crease it alter
out the day it's just a really cool
invention and it's kind of like a two in
one product and it really has been one
of my favorite primers this summer so I
have been enjoying and loving that a lot
let's talk about a bubble bath that has
been a lifesaver this week so when I do
come out of a lupus flare up and when
I'm in a lupus flare up I can't be using
too many products that are heavily
fragranced and a lot of my body washes
and like bubble baths and things like
that are super heavily fragrance but I
have been using the Mario Badescu
seaweed bubble bath
this is what it looks like it's so
calming on the skin you guys it says our
fragrant and moisturizing two-in-one
shower gel and bubble bath refreshes the
skin with an invigorating blend of
botanicals so this is what it looks like
and it is just so beautiful on the skin
it just smells really really nice and
lightweight it has algae extract in
there it has let's see here sesame oil
it's got carnation oil it's got ginseng
it's just really beautiful on the skin
it doesn't irritate my skin and it
doesn't make nice and bubbles so I've
been loving that as far as masking is
concerned I've been loving at my glam
glow youth my to tingle exfoliate
treatment I just love this mask you guys
know it is one of my favorites from glam
glow this is what it looks like I love
the smell - it smells like green tea but
this is what the actual mass looks like
if you do have sensitive skin you
definitely should stay away but if you
have aging skin or dry skin or oily skin
or combo skin I think you would really
like this you put it on it definitely
starts to tingle on your face and then
when you're rubbing it off or when
you're actually rinsing it off you um
you know massage in circular motions
because there are fully aiding beads in
here and it really really microderm to
your face my face feels so soft like a
little baby vibe after I use this so I
really love this product let's see here
a mascara I have been liking this week I
didn't like the oak econo Milano or
whatever it's called I can never say
that name I swear to God the I Kona
Milan out mascara I didn't really like
this one but I did a parrot with my
Laura Mercier extra lash sculpting
mascara in the shade of black onyx and I
love this like this is the kind of one
that I like I know I showed you guys
this before but like this big like pokey
thing it looks like some sort of
medieval torture tool this is the kind
of mascara wand that I like so I have
been enjoying that a lot this week for
highlighting I have been using my violet
Voss highlighting powder trio this is
what it looks like it's a little pallid
this thing is getting so dirty and used
up but you have three highlighting
shades here as you guys can see and
they're very very beautiful you can use
the two darker shades as blush Stoppers
if you do have very fair skin like I do
but this shade right here called moon
gleam is so so so beautiful on fair skin
let me go ahead and swatch it for you
guys I just love it it's so beautiful
and I like to buff these into the skin
there is moogly
and then this shade right here is called
star glow and then this one is unicorn
luster so they're all really really
beautiful very heavily pigmented in my
opinion and I think they look gorgeous
on the skin so there is moon gleam then
we have star glow and unicorn luster
unicorn luster like how cute of a name
is that
alright let's see here okay let's talk
about a moisturizing product so in the
morning I've been putting on a
moisturizer and then an oil the
moisturizer I've been using is actually
from my glossy box from last month this
is the talika photo hydra de face
specific hydration gel this is what it
looks like you guys this stuff is the
fit okay it's really really nice if you
do have combo or oily skin it sinks in
incredibly quickly and I really like
that it has a nice little bit of
fragrance to it as well if you do have
dry skin or sensitive skin or aging skin
this is not going to be enough hydration
for you and also I think a little bit of
fragrance in there might irritate your
skin if you are sensitive but if you
have combo or oily skin and you want a
nice lightweight moisturizer that's more
of like a gel creme consistency and it
really does kind of lock the moisture in
I think you would love this product and
then I have been using half a dropper
full of the Korres Wild Rose the vitamin
C active brightening oil on top just to
combat my oil you guys know I like to
combat my oil with oil so this is what
it looks like this is one of my all-time
favorite oils I want to say really
quickly this is more of a clarifying oil
or a treatment oil it's not like argan
oil that's going to moisturize your face
this is really going to help brighten
the skin so I just wanted to put it out
there I got a lot of questions of people
asking oh can I get this for dry skin
and the thing is is this really truly is
more of a brightening oil or a treatment
oil so it's more for people who probably
have conv or oily skin who deal with
like hyperpigmentation and things like
that alright I have a little eyeliner
here that I've been loving I'm almost
used this up completely I think this is
one of my favorite black eyeliners of
all time this is the Sephora black
eyeliner crayon in the shade is 0-1
moire or black this is what it looks
like and it's just a beautiful little
crayon it keeps breaking I cannot
sharpen this thing without like half of
it falling off but I swear to you it is
like the richest darkest black that I've
ever put
my waterline and it actually wears a
significantly long time on the waterline
alright guys and they last item that
I've been loving this week is the eyes
lips face the elf I should say I think
it's called the 18 shadow palette this
is what it looks like so you have a big
mirror and then these are the colors and
a few people were telling me this is
still on the website and it is called
the 18 shadow palette it really doesn't
like have a name on the back so I have
no idea but it's absolutely beautiful
you're getting like or just like foiled
eyeshadows in here and I just love the
way that these look on the skin so there
are a few swatches on the back of my
hand
really really beautiful you get some
math you get some like I said oiled or
luster shades in here and this has been
a really fun palette for me to play
around with I am excited to dig into my
Laura Lee by Lovaas palette next week
but I do like doing this thing where I
switch back and forth between a
drugstore palette and a high-end palette
because it really lets me and allows me
to get into some of my drugstore
palettes that are really good quality so
and that is the last item that I am in
loving this week I hope you guys enjoyed
my fails in Holly face thank you so much
for joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow for shop and squash my stash
