welcome back to my finals in Hana
Greco's so where I share with you guys
the products that I have been loving
this week and the products that I have
been hating this week so we are going to
start with the fails and always the
first fail is this dr. jart um BB mate
contour bronzing stick that has
broad-spectrum SPF 30 in it it's a
lovely lovely texture and consistency
but the color just looks so darn muddy
on my skin you guys now the reason I
continue to use this is because it is an
item that I am trying to use up in 2016
but I just can't get this to look
natural on me I think it's almost too
cool toned warm toned I'm not quite sure
it's weird it's like a muddy color so it
has sort of like an ashy undertone but
then it also leans a little more maybe
he's just a little too neutral for me
I'm not quite sure what it is it blends
out beautifully you guys I really think
it is like a nice consistency but the
second that I get this on my face I'm
like oh God like I don't even know it
has orange tones in it it's got gray
tones in it it just looks very unnatural
and very unflattering on my particular
skin tone so that is definitely the
first fail and the first item that I
have not been liking this week alright
the second feel for the week has been
the masks that I have been using I feel
like this does nothing for my skin you
guys this is the origins out of trouble
10-minute mask to rescue problem skin
this is the weirdest thing ever so this
has sulfur in it but to mask the actual
sulfur smell they put in a scent that is
literally identical to what's it called
the Vicks VapoRub like that strong
eucalyptus scent that's exactly what
this smells like it's just this white
thick mask that you put on it never
dries down I don't feel like it does
anything for my skin I don't feel like
it hydrated it I don't feel like it
helps with blemishes or anything like
that this is just a really really crappy
mass so that has definitely been a feel
as well and those were the two
disappointing products for the week
alright let's go ahead and get into the
holy grails the first two has been my
mascara combination this week a lot of
you have been commenting and saying that
you really liked the way my lashes look
this week so it has been the little duo
that I've been wearing has been the
covergirl super sizer fibers as my
bass mascara and I have been topping
that with the Maybelline the falsies
push-up drama I think it's the
Maybelline falsies push-up drama that
really is giving me the definition that
you guys have been seen on my lashes
this week because it has this really
really spikey pokey little wand and I
just love the way it defines my lashes
you guys this is definitely in my
opinion a dupe for the Laura Mercier
extra lash sculpting mascara which is
one of my all-time favorite mascaras it
does heavy very oily and wet formulation
so if you don't like that you probably
wouldn't like this but it's very very
nice and I like the way that it defines
my lashes alright I have been having a
fragrance pairing this week that has
been on my favorite the first is the
Victoria's Secret such a flirt perfume I
literally have maybe two more uses of
this perfume as you guys can see there's
like the tiny is a little bit at the
bottom but this is a really really nice
sweet smelling perfume so I have been
pairing it with my bath and Bodyworks
pleasures Pure Barre body splash this is
what it looks like and this is a blend
of strawberry and pear it smells amazing
and the two of these together smell so
good
they just smell very very sweet and
fruity and delicious together been
loving those together I also have a
skincare item here that I have been
enjoying at nighttime and this is a
toner from let's see here Neutrogena
this is the oil-free acne stress control
triple action toner it has micro clear
technology and 2% salicylic acid I have
been using this at nighttime and I just
loved what it's doing for my skin I feel
like it really helps with those little
bumps that you get underneath your skin
you know those really tiny little bumps
like along your jawline and on your
foreheads that you feel like you just
can't get rid of I feel like this really
really helps at nighttime I only use it
at nighttime because it is quite drying
if you have sensitive skin I would stay
far away it has a very very strong scent
and on top of that it definitely does
tingle and it has 2% salicylic acid
which might make you sensitive but yeah
I like using at nighttime I like this
add I don't use it in the morning
because it does have salicylic acid in
it which will make you Sun sensitive but
it's been a really really good one I
have three lip products here that I have
been loving and these are all items that
I'm trying to use up in 2016 the first
is the Revlon just bitten kissable balm
stain in the shade honey which looks
like that I'm wearing that on my lips
right now I
of the easy-like use of this or yeah I
love how easy it is to use basically is
what I'm trying to say I love how easy
it is to use it smells really really
good it reminds me of a charts lip
surgence is quite a bit and I feel like
it's fade on the lips relatively well
and now this one on the other hand the
color riche of balm in the shade 218
rose elixir from L'Oreal doesn't really
stay on the lips that long but it's very
very comfortable to wear and I probably
am going to bring this up to the cabin
there it is it's just a beautiful wash
of color and shine onto the lips and I
really really like it I think it's a
very very comfortable and these color
riche balms are actually really really
nice and then the third item is the NYX
butter gloss I can't open it open
alright the mix of butter gloss in the
shade tiramisu which is beautiful and I
feel like it pairs with these two lip
colors really nicely so there we have
the Revlon then we have the rose elixir
and then there we have tiramisu from NYX
so really really pretty neutral kinds of
your lips but better colors and love all
three of those and I have really been
enjoying using those this week all right
I have a body wash that I have been
loving it is actually a holiday scent
and this is the Bath and Body Works Shea
and vitamin E sour gel in the be joyful
scent now this actual scent notes in
here are Clementine mango jasmine melon
melon and sugar so it actually smells
very very sweet and like fruity you know
kind of like summertime scent however
the way that they like word the actual
names like sparkling Clementine golden
mango frosted jasmine it just makes it
seem like it's a wintertime scent but
honestly every time I smell this I'm
like it just smells like fruity reminds
me of summertime so I really have been
enjoying this a lot this week I love
this particular formulation of body wash
I feel like it's really nice not overly
drying a little goes a very long way and
actually it's very like cool feeling in
the shower it's very jelly like so I
like it a lot
alright I have a foundation that I've
been loving it is the Stila aqua glow
serum foundation in the fade in the fade
in the Shea
fair what was I trying to say in the
fade share in the shade fair it's
beautiful you guys I love it it is a um
you know water foundation or a serum
foundation so it has a really really
thin consistency to it not a whole lot
of coverage but I think it looks
absolutely beautiful on the face I am
wearing it right now I just love how it
really really kind of looks like skin
but it still gives you a little bit of
coverage this is probably the one serum
or water foundation that I have it
really can kind of build up like
coverage on the face but for the most
part I've just been wearing one layer at
this this week and what I do is I just
take one dropper full onto the back of
my hands I like to apply it with a damp
sponge and I just think it looks
beautiful on the skin so I really really
been enjoying that I also have been
enjoying my Bobbi Brown
extra SPF 25 teaching moisturizing balm
in the shade alabaster but this is
beautiful
it has a very strong scent and you have
to keep this away from your eye area
because it definitely stings but this is
a really really nice primer or tinted
moisturizer it is a very humectant and
very moisturizing so you would love this
if you have dry skin and I have been
enjoying it as my primer this week I
have been enjoying the dr. jar to be
teammates highlighting stick which looks
like this so it's the same formulation
as that contouring product except that
this is the highlighting version if you
have very very fair skin this is going
to show up on you it's super super super
pastel like pink really beautiful to
highlight your face with and I just love
the consistency on this it has a really
nice color unlike its brother product
which is that a horrible horrible kind
of contouring product it's like that
weird yellowish color but anyway I
really like that a lot I also have been
loving my violet boss Laura Lee
eyeshadow palette it's what I have on my
eyes today I think it's stunning
I have this shade in 1988 and hissy-fit
on today and I just absolutely adore
this eyeshadow palette you guys I think
it's beautiful stunning just really
really gorgeous and let's see here at
the last two items I have been loving
this week are the Clinique ablating
illuminating powder in the shade 0-1
nude glow
pair together with my ambient strobe
lighting powder in incandescent light
and you guys these are just so stunning
together
I like the formulation a lot on both of
these I think they're very similar here
is the Clinique one and here is the
hourglass the two of these together just
give beautiful amounts of light to your
face without looking glittery or chunky
or overdone and actually I have one more
product do more products sorry totally
forgot about my blushes but my blush is
this week that I've been loving are the
gosh multi color blush in pink pie which
looks like this this is a product I'm
trying to use up in 2016 and I also have
been loving the Physicians Formula happy
booster in the shade warm this gives a
gorgeous gorgeous coral effect to the
cheeks so anyway those are all of my
fails and how the gray Ellis for the
week I hope you guys enjoyed this I
don't feel like I had too many but these
were the products that I shot my stash
with that I thought were really good or
really bad some of them I left out
because they didn't really impress me or
they didn't really you know they'd
either I didn't hate them but I didn't
love them and just liked them so anyway
I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for joining me and I will
see you guys tomorrow for shopkins watch
my stash bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
