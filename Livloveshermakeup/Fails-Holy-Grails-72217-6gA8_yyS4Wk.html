channel welcome back to my brush hills
and how the rails or I share with you
guys the products I have been loving
this week and of course the products I
have not been loving I have been doing a
sales and holy grails on my channel for
well over a year now it is a weekly
series where I share the products that
I've been loving and some products that
I have not been loving it does go hand
in hand with my shop my stash series as
well as look at the week I did get away
from doing those series for a while but
they will all be making a comeback as
you guys are curious the reason why I
got away from them was just because of
the move and honestly there were other
videos I wanted to get up first but yeah
we're about to build Holy Grail so let's
go ahead and start with the product that
did not work for me this week this is be
a benefit gimme brow
I found this as I was unpacking at the
Beauty room and I do wear the shade
light you guys this is just way too
 messy for me I don't think I
have enough scale to use this okay I
really really like pencils that are a
little more on the moist side and I
really like the thought concept behind
this I think that if you wipe off the
actual applicator with a tissue you
really could get these nice sole almost
a messy looking brows that are very very
natural like you just have a nice full
brow but unfortunately it's very goopy I
don't like the fact that I have to wipe
off the applicator because I'm just
wasting product and I do feel like the
shade is a little too dark for me so I'm
going to go ahead and declutter this
because I'm really just not feeling it
so yeah that is the first item as it is
a fail let's go ahead and talk about the
Holy Grail shall we I want to start with
you at different palettes here from
colour-pop I will be doing a get ready
with me for you guys either tomorrow or
sometime in next a week using these so
the first one is be giving more pressed
powder highlighting palettes and the
second one is be yes please I shadow
palette so both of these are sent to me
by my friend Brittany we are makeup
swapping buddies so basically we swapped
makeup back and forth and she surprised
me with these so originally I had no
intention of getting this yes please
palette you guys know I am not much for
like warm toned eyeshadows I pull a
strong cool undertone I love cool toned
eyeshadows but these are actually really
good quality you guys I feel like they
are even smoother and kind of softer to
the touch within the Amanda steel
palette which was sent to me from
colour-pop for PR a couple of months ago
that was a palette I changed my mind
about these are even better I did end up
picking up the fender all sub palette as
well so I'm going to go ahead and do a
little side-by-side comparison for you
guys but I really
you like this and I will do it get ready
with me and honestly it's good quality
you guys and then as far as the
highlighting palette is concerned I've
been loving as these two shades right
here this cool tone peak and then this
gold right here I have a little more
color so I can actually pull off the
gold but there they are swatch they are
actually a lot more subtle than I
thought they would be and I think they
look absolutely beautiful on the skin
the pink shade is called
upgrade and then bigger and better is on
the bottom very soild consistency very
reminiscent of the Nicole Garoppolo kit
so if you missed out on that would
highly recommend you check that baby out
all right the next item I have here is
from 100% pure this is their brightening
a serum so this was sent to me in
exchange for an honest review from octa
Lee as well as a hundred percent pure I
really enjoyed this I feel like if you
have very very sensitive skin and you
still want skin brightening properties
in a serum this is a good way to go it
is vegan it is cruelty free if it's
something I would personally purchase in
April side with my own money
maybe we'll see I want to see if it has
even more brightening properties but as
you guys can see this is a very very
small tube so I haven't noticed the
biggest difference but I do like that it
sinks into my skin immediately I do like
that there is a little bit of
brightening going on and I like that
it's all natural so I have been enjoying
that I also have been enjoying my Bumble
and Bumble pressed a powder this is
equal parts of dry shampoo and style
extender in one and now this is nothing
I've had in my collection for well over
a year unfortunately bumble bumble does
tests on animals so I would not
repurchase but when I use this and
working through my hair it gives it
volume it gives it a little bit of
texture which I normally had very fine
of flimsy hair so I don't mind a little
bit of texture it does leave a little
bit of a sticky and tacky residue which
I'm not the biggest fan of but it is
really really good it's kind of like a
hair spray and dry shampoo in one so I'm
going to join that a lot I also happen
to join this combo right here of my it
cosmetics your skin's a better CC
illumination cream indie shade fair
pairing together with my torture shake
tape in the shade fair I feel like the
two of them looks so pretty next to each
other though there so this guy right
here really has a nice amount of
coverage for a CC cream I still prefer
the original one over this one this one
does have glitter infused in it and you
will notice that if you are in direct
sunlight I do not like this and I lived
in Milwaukee because I felt like they
made me look very very oily but here and
now that I do have more normal to dry
skin
I definitely don't abandon um that I
definitely don't mind a little bit of
scene that again
so anyway side would be of the battery
it's like running low on my camera but
anyway I do not mind the actual scene
that this kids to the skin now what I
really like is pumping one pump of this
onto a damp sponge or onto a brush of
buffing it all over my skin and then
taking three drops of this guy
underneath my eyes and on my eyelid and
I love the combination of a CC cream and
a full coverage concealer it just looks
so good if these are a little too light
for me currently but I really do enjoy
them now because they are cute like I
have been going in and actually
basically set in my face bronzer the
past couple of weeks and I have been
loving my Becca sunlit bronzer in D
shade of Bali sand this does have a
little bit of a glow to it a little bit
of a shimmer very similar to the bronzer
I have on today which is the Physicians
Formula where more butter bronzer in the
shade bronzer and I actually have been
having to go in and put bronzer all over
my face because that's how light those
products are currently I definitely got
a little bit of a tan but I really enjoy
these definitely no need to pick up a
nice unlit bronzer since either like $32
the Physicians Formula will give you the
same sort of thing but if you are
sensitive to fragrance would highly
recommend going with those guys alright
next I do have a perfume here that's
most amazing I have been loving
this is called the rose perfume from
Jean SA so I believe I got this any
subscription box you guys can see it has
been very much well loved I just really
liked it it's a super super sweet rose
scent there is no like baby powder
undertone and there is absolutely no
really strong spicy undertone so I've
been enjoying the hell out of that and
finally guys but the last item I have
here to share is see Tasha polished a
gentle rice enzymic powder this has been
a favorite for like three weeks now
I really am considering getting a full
size of this like I said my skin has
completely changed now that I am living
down in the desert and what I notice is
that this really goes on and nicely and
I really like that it gives a little bit
of a scrub without irritating my skin so
it literally is a little powder as you
guys can see what i do is i dampen on my
hands with water
of course them into the palm of my hand
I mix it together and then I apply it
all over my face and I just think it's
great a really good option if you do
have more sensitive skin I'm not even
that sensitive but I really really enjoy
it
so anyway guys
on my fields and holy grails for the
week let me know down below what
products have been working for you and
what products have not been working for
you and I guess I will catch you guys
tomorrow
