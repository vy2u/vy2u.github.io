today because why the hell not um anyway
today's video is going to be my vitals
and how to Grail where I share with you
guys the products I have been loving
this week and I also share the products
that have been complete and utter
so let's go ahead and start with the
fails the first one is the schmidts and
natural deodorant in the bergamot and
lime sent this is what it looks like it
smells amazing it helps with wetness
protection it helps with your Bo you're
probably like why the hell don't you
like it you guys this has I believe
orange orange seed oil yes it also has
bergamot oil and also let's see here in
vitamin E oil in here and I swear to you
it stains your clothing it leaves you
greasy underneath the armpits and stains
your clothing and I can't get the stains
out so this has to go I'm going to pass
it on to my mom when I am up at the
cabin which by the way I leave tomorrow
there has been a few schedule changes i
have a rehearsal that popped up tomorrow
morning at 9am so i will be leaving then
and if you guys are curious i have a two
week break so you might not be seen as
much as me as you would like i tried to
make as many pre filmed videos as I
could but yes I will be up at my family
cabin and I will be filming when I'm up
there as well alright moving on is the
next item that was a feel for me this
week was the I'm really up close and
personal I'm sorry guy but did not even
realize that happened alright the next
item that has been a fail for me this
week has been the bhcosmetics flawless
brow gel in the shade blonde I used to
love this stuff I'm basically it's just
a brow gel that you put onto your brows
and it has a little bit of iridescent so
it kind of makes your brows look fuller
because there's like a little bit of
Sheen going on there for some reason I
really just didn't like this this week
so i don't know if i will declutter this
in the fall alright let's go ahead and
get into the Holy Grails the first holy
grail is definitely this little paring
right here you guys will see this in an
upcoming video called my favorite summer
perfumes this is the coach citrine
blossom puppy citrine blossom perfume
and I have impairing that a wiki Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works white ginger and white notin
know what tea and ginger bodies flash
that this is what it looks like it
smells so good I'm just spray some right
now don't open your mouth you don't obey
you up
okay it's okay this smells so good you
guys it just smells really really fresh
like green tea and just freshness and
just happiness so I've been enjoying
that a lot this week and the next item
that I have been loving this week is the
honest hacia Beverly Hills glow kit in
the sweets version this is like my new
BAE you guys I'm totally obsessed with
this it's so beautiful this is what it
actually looks like you just have some
gorgeous gorgeous colors in here I love
the pigmentation I love the way they sit
on the skin like they don't even sit on
the skin they just kind of blend in
nicely beautiful absolutely love that i
also have been loving the coastal scents
revealed 2 palette this is basically a
knockoff or a dupe for the naked 3
palette which you guys know i did not
like and I got rid of and I really like
this one and people ask me why did i get
rid of the naked 3 it wasn't because of
the colors I like the colors a lot it
was just the actual texture in the
formulation I just prefer this I really
like those pinky tones you can see on
the upper row you get a lot of those and
then on the bottom row you get some dark
smoky color so those are nice for like
liner shades and also just going like
you know in your outer v things like
that in the next four items I have been
loving are these Smashbox color
correcting sticks we have don't be dull
which is a purple we also have look less
tired light we have look less tired dark
and get less red so we basically have an
orange creamsicle shade we have a peachy
shade and we have a green shade and a
purple shade and you can do whatever the
hell you want with these sorry i'm
tossing things on the floor because
there's not a room on my music stand but
anyway you can use those for whatever
you really want you can use a purple one
to kind of lift fine lines and wrinkles
to kind of brighten the skin cell
illness in the skin yellow tone things
like that and then of course the orange
ones i like to put underneath my eyes
alright then moving on i did find a
deodorants them have been laughing i
ordered this after the schmidts one girl
it smells so good this is the lava nila
so this is also a natural deodorant this
is the healthy deodorant in the fresh
vanilla lemon scent and if you guys are
curious my rheumatologist or my like
lupus doctor basically recommended that
i find something with no aluminum in it
because there have been known cases of
getting more flare ups when you have
aluminum like in your body and a lot of
like products that you put on to your
body especially like in the area of your
armpits definitely can like kind of seep
into the glands so i really want to
find one that I liked like I said I
didn't like the schmidts but this one is
amazing it has a really nice cooling
sensation it definitely doesn't leave me
greasy under the armpits and i love the
vanilla and lemon scent together so that
has been definitely a Holy Grail and the
next is a ambient lighting blush from
our class this is in diffused heat this
is beautiful it really looks like you
just went out for a run and you come
back in and your cheeks are just like
you know like I said looks like you went
for a run which I didn't but it looks
like it but the next much I've been
loving is the Palladium at blush in the
shade toasted apricot this is beautiful
as well I actually love the formulation
on this very very smooth very very
creamy very very buttery if you have
never checked out the brand Palais do
you probably should alright I have to
lip oils here that I've really been
enjoying a lot of people actually don't
like these but i recently picked them up
they are the Physicians Formula organ
wear lip oils in list see here that
let's see here liquid gold and pink
these are very nice I've been putting
them on top of liquid lipsticks and it's
very interesting because although they
are oils they haven't been breaking down
the actual product so they're very
pretty they leave your lips very soft
and moisturized and also they leave you
with a very glossy finish and speaking
of liquid lipsticks I've been wearing my
Oprah Manny collaboration lippies this
week in the shade charmed which looks
like this a nice MA be your lips but
better shade and also Aries which is a
beautiful kind of nudie color it leads
more on the peach side or warm side but
it still looks good on me so I like that
I normally don't look very good in nude
lips so I really do like that all right
I have two eye creams here that I have
been loving the first is actually in I
gel the second isn't eye cream so I have
been using the peter thomas roth
anti-aging cellular i repair gel at
night time it is just a clear jelly and
you put this on underneath your eyes on
your eyelid be careful with this one you
do not want to get it anywhere actually
like near your lashline because it does
sting quite a bit but i love this it's
very cooling it's very hydrating and I
do feel like it kind of lifts and firms
my under eye area so that is been it
that has been very nice alright the next
item is the Olay 7 CC eye brightening CC
cream should I say that right CC eye
brightening CC cream that's right ok so
this is what it looks like this is a
beautiful little eye cream it has a
little bit of a tint or your ad essence
to it and a little bit of a peachy tone
so it actually helps to cancel out blue
tones which is awesome has a very things
like ol a sort of scent and I really
really like this in the morning because
i feel like it helps to cancel out blue
tones under my eyes so that i don't have
to use as many color correctors and also
on top of that i just feel like it
really makes my concealer glide on
nicely so i've been enjoying that
speaking of concealer the concealer i've
been loving this week is the Too Faced
Born This Way naturally radiant
concealer in the shade very fair this is
so beautiful and it matches me perfectly
when I have a tan which is weird like
you would think like very fair that
would be when I met my feylis but no
it's a little dark when I met my
playlist but right now I'm self hand and
it matches me perfectly beautiful
beautiful finish to this if you have dry
skin or you don't want a super heavy
concealer underneath your eyes I highly
highly recommend that one I have to face
mask fear that I have been loving this
week the first is the Michael Todd
pumpkin pie pumpkin yeah pumpkin no
pumpkin a nutrient-rich facial map it
says that moisturizes and nourishes the
skin I don't know about that
moisturization but this has glycolic
acid in it has a little bit of salicylic
acid and I'm telling you right now this
will clear up breakups break up to break
out like overnight and cannot be I'm
thinking too bad this little clearer
breakouts like overnight it's really
nice it smells like pumpkin pie and it
does have a little bit of like
exfoliating particles on there if you
have sensitive skin stay far away from
this product girl say far away because
this is going to be way too much for
your skin it does give a little bit of a
slight tingling sensation I do I have
started to actually mask every single
day and I remember the first day I use
this like it was burning around my eyes
and around my nose as well and I was
like what the hell um but anyway after
you start to use it a little more I was
using it everyday
notice the skin texture like on my face
it's been looking a lot nicer I'm not
even wearing makeup today and I think it
looks good and also it does help to
exfoliate the skin so I've been enjoying
that a lot and then at nighttime I've
been getting real lazy I've been quite
busy so what I like to do when I am lazy
and also at nighttime when I just don't
want to put on a whole face of skincare
I go in with an overnight mask because
if you're gonna at least put something
on your face at least wash it and then
put something on and I think an
overnight mask is perfect for that so
I've been loving my origins drink up
intensive overnight mask my skin have
been just a little dry and dehydrated
and kind of like also think I don't
really know it's been looking kind of
crappy so I really really been enjoying
that it has a gorgeous smell to it like
guava or like candy I don't even know
but it really moisturizes nicely it does
leave the skin a little tacky only to
use a small amount if you have oily or
combo skin like i do but i have been
loving it alright i also have been
loving these two primers this week the
first is the l'oreal magic decrease base
primer eyelid primer in the shade 895 it
has a little bit of a yellow tone to it
which is great for color correcting the
eyelids really really enjoy this I love
the way that my eyeshadows went on this
week when I was using that I also have
been loving my hourglass ambient light
correcting primer in luminous light I
like these a lot however I have found a
product that is similar and cheaper it
is the emit a diamond heart based soft
focus illuminating primer damn i
remember that i have been enjoying that
a lot more than this one they both go on
and they have like a slight you're in
essence to the skin like your
adjustments to the skin they give a
slight iridescent to the skin and
luminosity however they drive down so
quickly and if you have combo or oily
skin this is a good primer to use during
the summer time it will not hydrate your
skin and it will definitely not make you
only so i do enjoy that and i also have
been loving my tarts BB Amazonian clay
BB tinted moisturizer what the heck i
mean i thought there were just BB creams
and tinted moisturizers here we have a
two in one but this really does have
good coverage for a tinted moisturizer
so it's more like a BB cream it does
have broad spectrum SPF 20 and the shade
that I where is ivory this is really
really nice beautiful quite hydrating
without being oily and I do feel like
you can build up the coverage so I've
been enjoying that
I have been legging these two little
shadow sticks here I'm wearing on my
waterline this week they go really
nicely with that revealed 2 palette the
first is the sumita beauty champagne
eyeshadow pencil and there is no name on
either of these but this is what it
looks like it's a beautiful kind of mavi
iridescent color and i also have been
loving beef chili pom pom that is such a
cute name to say two-in-one eyeliner and
shadow again no name but it has a
beautiful rosy color to it looks really
nice with those rosy colors in the
reveal two three or two wait revealed
three no reveal to ya alright the next
thing that I have been loving is my
mascara combination i have been using
the Maybelline lash discovery mini brush
mascara which looks like this tiny tiny
tiny adorable tiny adorable little watch
really then enjoyed that a lot and then
I've been pairing it with my Urban Decay
perversion bigger black or bad or
mascara this is a great mascara very
very wet formulation probably not the
best for the summer time but it's still
great I really like the way that
volumizes and it's just a good product
really really enjoy that alright and
then the last product that i have been
loving this week is my honest hace of
Beverly Hills perfect brow pencil in the
shade taupe now I included this as a
fail a few weeks ago but I started using
it a different way so what I do is I put
brow wax on first and then I go in with
this and it seems to just glide on a lot
nicer the actual pencil tends to be a
little dry which is nice because you
really can get precise with it and not
make mistakes but for some reason I just
didn't like how this was working so like
I said I like to put the wax on and then
I go in with it and then I just take the
spoolie on the other end and then I
brush them out so I've been really
enjoying that all right guys those are
all of my petals and how the rails for
the week let me know down below what you
guys have been loving and if I am a
little behind on comments it is because
I'm just getting ready to go on my trip

everything like that but I hope you guys
