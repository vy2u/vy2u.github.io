welcome back to fails and holy grails
where i share with you guys what has
been working for me this week and what
has not been working so let's start with
the fails because I like to end things
with a happy note alright so the first
two things that have not been working
out for me are both shower baths air
products their hair products I don't
know what I'm saying
there are hair products the first one is
the Garnier Fructis grow strong mass
this is a four decline treatment I
really wanted this to work I recently
picked it up at Target but it makes my
hair feel like straw and I think it
might have some keratin like protein or
something in it and I know that if you
use too much keratin or too much protein
in your hair it can actually cause more
damage and lately I have been using deep
conditioners as my hair conditioner
every single time I shower so I feel
like this would be better as like a
reconstructing treat to Rivet
reconstructing treatment like once a
week or something like that kind of like
my Kevin Murphy one the angel mask that
I really like so yeah this was no good I
will just be using it as a like once a
week deep conditioner but yeah it's not
work for me very well I feel like it
just made my hair feel really strong
like and it's so sad because it smells
so good and I love this in a squeezy too
but I think it's just one of those
products you want to just stick to for
strengthening your hair not so much
softening alright and this is the second
product that did not work for me this
week is the main entail and body this is
actually for horses this is a horse
shampoo and it has 32 fluid ounces of
product and here you get a huge amount
for under $10 and I used to love this
when I had virgin hair this is not the
same bottle I've probably gone through
six or seven of these like in the past
five years but I remember when I was a
senior in high school I really wanted to
grow my hair out and strengthen it and I
used this and I absolutely loved it but
that was when I had virgin hair and I
wasn't bleaching the out of it
so it works a lot better and I just feel
like now it doesn't lather very well I
don't think it has sulfate in it which
is probably why sorry it does have salt
paint in it but it doesn't lather very
well and I don't like that I really like
something that lathers up it does clean
your hair but I just want to feel like
I'm cleaning my hair as I'm cleaning my
hair if that makes sense so anyway it
did not work for me think what I'll do
with this is go ahead and mix it into
other shampoos and that is how I will
use it from now on
alright let's get into a my Holy Grail I
have so many products you guys I'm sorry
if I'm reaching over here they're all
around me
Circle so anyway the first um Holy Grail
is actually like a food item so I've
been loving my I don't know if you guys
have you I hope you do
you should definitely need a Keurig if
you do not have a cure a Keurig it's
like amazing I really love using these K
cups from Starbucks these are the firaon
de blend Bowl on droste this is my
favorite cake up or just my favorite
like coffee to drink in the morning I
really don't like dark roast I don't
love the taste of coffee I've used a lot
of creamer and that leads me into the
second thing that particular coffee
mixed with this Coldstone international
delights sweet cream creamer is amazing
it tastes like you're dumping ice cream
into your coffee every single morning
like it's smells really good it tastes
really good it's honestly amazing so if
you can find this Cold Stone Creamery at
Target that's where I got mine
definitely pick it up alright the second
thing that I have been loving is the
bath and Bodyworks aromatherapy stress
relief eucalyptus spearmint luxury bath
I love these luxury bath from Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works this scent is amazing it was
a very very calming I've been having
kind of a stressful week and this was
just very calming kind of opened up my
sinuses a little bit I really really
love it and it makes a really really
nice soft luxurious bubbles in your bath
as far as body wash body lashes body
lotion goes I've been loving this
Victoria's Secret hydrating body lotion
I recently got this in my pop sugar
must-have box and it is the coconut milk
scent it smells so good like I feel very
sexy when I'm wearing this it just
smells so good you guys it smells very
very similar to the warm and cozy I
think that's what it's called
yeah warm and cozy body mist from
Victoria's Secret so if you like that
scent you would probably absolutely love
this body lotion I feel like it hydrates
really well and it sinks in right away
so I've been loving that from
moisturizing my body in the morning I
have been cleansing my face with the
Peter Thomas Roth row stem cell bio
repair cleansing gel this is amazing if
you have sensitive skin or dry skin or
aging skin you'd probably love this it's
just really really nice I was thinking
about putting sugar in it to make it
into a scrub in the morning because
usually I prefer scrubs but honestly
this is amazing all by itself I feel
like it takes off any sort of residue
that I might have
from like the night before like the
products I used on my face and it's just
so luxurious and nice and soft at
nighttime I have been using my oil-free
acne stress control triple action toner
from Neutrogena I have my period this
week and I've just been breaking out so
this is the main thing it has 2%
salicylic acid in it so it really clears
out your pores and it works really
really well in my opinion it does have a
very strong scent but I can get past it
if it is being ready getting rid of my
pimples alright the next product I have
been loving is the Korres Wild Rose
vitamin C brightening oil I've been
using this as my moisturizer in the
morning it's amazing it's a very
lightweight oil if you have oily skin or
combination skin you would probably
adore this and then I have been loving
my bare mineral skin longevity vital
power fusion in the morning this is like
the best serum ever I am definitely
getting a full size of it
it is on my love's list at Sephora
currently it is so nice it has the best
like thin milky texture it hydrates your
skin without leaving breast of you it's
just absolutely amazing so I've been
using that in the morning and I also
have been loving and using my Clinique
all about eyes this is just an eye cream
that reduces dark circles and puffy eyes
and it's really really nice it's so easy
to blend like onto the eye area it
doesn't tug or anything like that it's
wonderful alright and then the last
skincare products I have been loving
this week is the new to purify tawny
water this has cinnamon and cardamom in
it so if you have cardamom cardamom yes
cinnamon and cardamom in it so it's
cardamom cardamom so if you have
sensitive skin you will not like this
it'll probably irritate your skin but if
you have oily or combination skin you
would probably really like it I like it
a lot it has a pump which i think is
awesome and this is just a very very
good decent toner alright moving on as
far as hair care products code that I
haven't like hey I've been liking my
brioche EO ro Sarco milk reparative
leave-in conditioning spray I didn't
like this at first I only like this
depending on what products I'm mixing
with it when I mix it with the Pantene
pro-v
ultimate BB creme this is a beauty balm
for hair it works really really well but
sometimes if I mix it with other hair
serums it doesn't work very well however
I really really
like it with this Pantene one and this
is a very nice product as well I've been
using that on my ends this week really
mix them nice and silky and soft and
because I've been using that Garnier
Fructis grow strong treatment on my hair
and it was drying it out I felt like the
Pantene was like it went in and saved
the day
alright moving on the next product that
I've been loving is actually my
fragrance duo for the week I've been
loving my Victoria Secrets pear glass
say this is a sugared pair and casaba
melon cents this is a body mist I've
been carrying that with my Marc Jacobs
mod waar which smells like mod noir
which smells like gardenia and I've just
been loving this scent spring is coming
up really soon it is literally like 65
degrees here in Milwaukee today and I
just love it the way that these two
smell together so that has definitely
been my favorite as far as the nail
polish goes this week I one of those
people I'm like well if you don't want
to put a dark nail polish on at least
put like a clear nail polish or
something on so I've been loving this
Sally Hansen hard as nails nail polish
in the shade 140 cold as ice it's like
an iridescent yellow color and you're
usually supposed to wear this as like a
topper for any kind of nail polish but
I've been wearing it on my nails this
week and I just think it gives a nice
glow to them it does tinge them a little
yellow which is kind of weird but when
the light hits it right it just is like
a beautiful iridescent rainbow and I
really enjoy it so it will no make that
and now let's get into makeup so the
first thing I've been loving is my Too
Faced semi-sweet chocolate bar palette
you guys know I am doing the one month
one palette challenge and I have been
using this the whole entire month and I
have really been getting into this
palette I love it you get such a nice
arrangement of cool and warm tones and I
just think it's lovely it smells great
and I just say it's great all right as
far as blush is concerned I've been
loving my NYX blush in cinnamon which is
just a bright orange color you need to
be careful with this one not to use too
much when you apply it and I also have
been loving topping it with my Mac sheer
toned shimmer blush in this shade
sunbath sounds a lot S's in these shades
sunbath this is beautiful and I don't
feel like it's super super sheer you
guys know I don't like purchase a lot
from Mac I'm just not a huge an acts fan
but I do think they have beautiful
blushes so this is the matte one and let
me swatch the next one so you guys can
see them next
to each other I've been pairing those
together and I've just been getting
really nice glowy warm cheeks so there
is the cinnamon and there's max Sun bass
and I think they're just absolutely
beautiful so I'm in love it goes
together and then for my eyebrows this
week I've been really enjoying my Revlon
brows fantasy in dark blonde
I like this pencil it does make my
eyebrows look a little darker than they
actually are but I really like it
it glides on really really nicely it's a
very very creamy the formula is great
the only part of it that I don't like is
like the step number two which is the
gel I feel like it'll leave my eyebrows
with like a weird like white consistency
on them it's very very strange it just
doesn't dry down very well so I only
like the pencil part of this this is a
fail this is the Holy Grail
all right moving on as far as primers go
this week I have been loving my balm
timebomb face primer this is from the
balm and this is really nice it is a
silicone like primer but it's a very
very lightweight so if you don't like
the heavy oops if you don't like the
heavy consistency of a super super
silicone II primarylike you want a
silicone primer but you want something
lightweight you would probably like that
one from the balm and then as far as
eyeshadow primer is concerned I've been
using my Urban Decay eyeshadow primer
potion and then enjoying that a lot I
also have been using this Urban Decay
itses discontinued but I've been using
it on my eyelid this week it is the
Urban Decay heavy metal of glitter
eyeliner I really like it it's in the
shade baked which is a beautiful gold
color so really enjoy that
and then as far as foundation is
concerned foundation and concealer I've
been loving my Laura Mercier candle glow
soft luminous foundation my shade is
shell I just love the consistency of
this it's beautiful on the skin it's
definitely not full coverage it just
gives a beautiful glow and I feel like
less is more with this product
definitely less is more it starts to
look a little cakey if you do more than
one layer so less is more and then as
far as concealer is concerned I've been
loving my torch rainforest of the sea
aqua sealer this is so beautiful you
guys it just gives such a gorgeous like
a amount of coverage like you can put it
underneath the eyes you can build it up
it doesn't get cakey it's so so
beautiful in this game so I've been
loving that and just got all of that in
I've been
loving my Rimmel stay matte long-lasting
pressed powder in the shade zero zero
one transparent you guys can see I have
hit pan at this is just such a nice
matte powder and it but as far as
highlighting its concerned feel like
I've been talking too much already I've
been loving my hard candy baked bronzer
in the shade 129 tiki this is a baked
bronzer but it really shows up as a
highlight on pretty much everybody's
skin tone it that is what it looks like
it's a beautiful golden color I have it
swatch to right there and I feel like it
just goes so nicely with the blushes
I've been wearing this week you get so
much product and it's just so so so
beautiful on the skin all right before
mascara this week I've been loving my
urban decay lash primer and this is the
subversion lash primer this is my
all-time favorite lash primer and then
on my top or upper lashes I've been
wearing at my Physicians Formula sexy
booster cat eye collection mascara in
ultra black look at the packaging o best
packaging ever this has a really really
big wand and it's just a volume Isis the
lashes really really nicely but I only
like it on my upper lashes because the
wand is so freaking big like I poked my
eye out every time I'm trying to use it
on the lower one so only on the upper
ones and then on my lower lashes I've
been loving my wet and wild max volume
plus mascara this is just wonderful I
have the beautiful beautiful wand and I
feel like it really gets into like the
little tiny crevices around your
eyelashes because I kind of have like a
what is it like hourglass shaped long
sort of things so it's kind of thicker
towards the bottom and then thinner
towards the tops top so you really can
get in to those little aware lashes so I
really have been loving that for these
lower lashes and then I've been loving
this bite Beauty dual ended lipstick
this week on the shade is fig and date
let me show you big it's a little more
cool toned and then date is a little
more warm toned I'm wearing date today
let me go ahead and swatch them for you
guys so there is date just a beautiful
peachy nude color and then here is fig
which is a little more it's definitely
like peachy nude but a little more pink
so there they are together we have fig
and then in date really really pretty
love these love the formulation they
just stay on the lips so nicely and
they're so great
and so easy-to-use they're just
absolutely amazing I want to make sure I
put them on the right cap so I know
which is which
all right and then the last product that
I have been loving this week is the NYX
slide on glide on definitely a turn-on
whatever eyeliner these already do for
the urban decay 24/7 glide-on eye
pencils if you like those you will love
these this shade is called SL 16 golden
bronze you guys look at this color like
this is so full lip and gorgeous it is
right there can you guys see look how
beautiful that is it's gorgeous on the
waterline and the arm what's called
again waterline and the tight line it's
gorgeous on the waterline and the tight
lining the wearing it like that all week
and I just absolutely love it so yeah
those are all the products that have
been failed in Holograms for the week I
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for joining me and I will
see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
