welcome back to my piles and how the
rails where I share with you guys the
products that I have been loving this
week and the products that I have been
hating let's go ahead and start with the
hate the first one is from Clinique this
is the pep start hydrochloride this was
so thick and dometic own like like too
thick it kind of reminds me of the
Smashbox what is it the purple primer
like the one for your pores like I can't
work with that for whatever reason is
started to ball up on my skin and I feel
like this did the same exact thing so I
did not like that I felt like it was
just too thick too much on my skin i
also have not been liking this ofra
silicone primer gel I feel like this
does nothing for my makeup as far as
like keeping it on my face all day i got
it for like four dollars and ninety-nine
cents off of hautelook it doesn't have a
scent or anything but it's really weird
because you would think something called
Silicon primer gel would kind of like
blur and fill in your pores and fine
lines however this just felt like a I
don't know gel moisturizer and it really
didn't do that much for my skin so I'll
probably go ahead and declutter that
when i start at my declutter series in
October alright moving on let's go ahead
and get into the Holy Grails the first
one is the josie maran vibrancy
foundation fluid the shade that I where
is called dynamic and I am wearing half
a pump of it on my face right now I love
this foundation it is my all-time
favorite foundation I think it would be
beautiful for all sorts of different
skin tones and also types they have like
25 different shades and also this is
great for dry skin combo skin oily skin
if you do have really oily skin you want
to make sure you're using kind of a
mattifying primer and then make sure you
do set everything in but for the most
part this is an amazing foundation I
love the way it looks on the skin look
like I said I wearing half a pump today
I keep looking in the viewfinder because
I didn't do my brows today I feel like I
look a little kooky but anyway I think
it looks absolutely stunning on the skin
and you can either go really light with
it or you can build it up to full
coverage all right I have two products
here from peter thomas roth that i
wanted to talk about the first is the
pumpkin enzyme mask this is an enzymatic
dermal resurfacer you have chemical
exfoliants and also physical exfoliation
here so you're getting a double whammy
it smells amazing just like pumpkin pie
super super good and the reason why I
pulled this out was because one of you
sent me a snap and showed me what you
got from that so for a VIP event like a
week ago and you had
gotten this so I pulled mine out for the
week and I've enjoyed it also I wanted
to touch on the unwrinkle peel pads hmm
excuse me hmm have something on my
throat anyway I wanted to touch on the
unwrinkled field bathroom peter thomas
roth a few you were asking since i
started using sunday riley products at
nighttime you were wondering if i still
use these the answer is yes i still use
them in the morning and at night time i
leave them on for three minutes and then
i go ahead and I rinse it off of my skin
this does have glycolic salicylic and
lactic acids in them a lot of these
sunday riley products also have those
plus retinol in them so people were
curious if this was just too much for my
skin the two of them paired together but
the answer is no I have still been
loving these these are a Holy Grail Holy
Grail product for me all the time
alright the next item I have been loving
is my little mascara duo for the week
the first is the covergirl clump crusher
that has been layer 1 and layer 2 has
been benefit they're real mascara these
are really nice together like I said
today I have a little more natural
makeup on today I'm not wearing any sort
of eyeshadow but I feel like my
eyelashes look nice and defined but not
overdone not clumpy I feel like these
pair together beautifully if you do have
the two of these at home I would highly
recommend pairing them together and let
me know what you think alright so the
next item I have been loving are these
sephora yuzu cleansing wipes now you
probably have heard me talking about
these all the time recently because i
did pick up all five flavors or all five
all five flavors all five flavors are
all five cents on the sephora calm
website i will say these two right here
are my absolute favorite they are a
little pricey I feel like they're like
950 750 know maybe they're not that
pricey I think they're 750 for a pack of
30 or now 25 wipes so my favorites like
I said are the rows one and also this
one this one's really nice at toning the
skin use do is very high in vitamin C so
it's really nice for brightening up in
the morning and I've just been taking
one cloth and just running it over my
face in the morning it's been a really
easy and wonderful cleanse and they
smell like lemon you guys know how I
feel about citrus smelling things I love
that so I've been enjoying that point of
it the next item that I have really been
enjoying is the two-faced Coco contour
chiseled to perfection kits this was my
first contour kit that I ever got and it
is still a favorite it does smell
slightly like cocoa powder you do have a
light coat
shading here you have a nice cool tone
shade you have a warm tone shade and
then you have this kind of interesting
glittery highlight over here i would say
these three god I cannot do this in the
viewfinder those three are really really
beautiful i love the way they go onto
the skin very smooth very creamy very
buttery so I've been enjoying that
little kit i also have been enjoying
this little Estee Lauder revitalizing
supreme global anti-aging creme I've
been using this as my moisturizer in the
morning I think I picked up six of these
four 100.5 said so far recently so far
as having some amazing like perks point
Brooks right now so I'm saving mine up
and racking them up but this one is so
beautiful really nice if you do have
comp or oily skin because it sinks in
immediately i also have been loving this
little 100-point burke and this is the
Korres golden crocus saffron it's not
saffron I think it's saffron saffron
what is this it's basically like a
mixture of an emulsion with a serum it's
slightly sticky and tacky on the skin
but if you guys can see it has this nice
like yellow iridescent to it which is
almost why I want to call it saffron it
has a nice beautiful a little your ad
essence to it and it really makes the
skin look nice and firm and also very
very glowy so I've been enjoying that a
lot and it smells absolutely amazing the
next item I have been loving is my Luna
oil this is from sunday riley i did go
ahead and pick up that good genes duo so
uh you have the good genes lactic acid
treatment here and then the luna
sleeping oil i think this was around 82
dollars but so so so worth it so i've
been loving the two of those together
and I take go ahead and pick up the UFO
oil in full size and also the no Martian
toner which I know I told you guys last
week I was like I don't need that I just
need the sleeping oil and the lactic
acid treatment because I'm not super
oily right now but let's be honest I
still get breakouts and stuff so what
I'm going to be doing is switching off
every night so one night like monday
wednesday friday-sunday whatever i'll
use these two together and then on the
off days i will use the Martian toner
and the UFO oil so we shall see how
those go I think those are coming in
tomorrow so I'm super excited to try
them out i also have been loving my tart
CC colored clay I primer this is Newton
e and this is really cool i love how
quick it is you just take the top off
you paint it onto your eyelid really
quickly I like it
because even though the color is a
little bit on like the salmon eat own
side it's like a little darker than my
skin tone it still is really really nice
for kind of color correcting the area so
that is what it looks like very easy to
blend out on the skin I've really been
enjoying that quite a bit alright moving
on i also have been enjoying my benefit
do the Kula so this is a soft matte
liquid bronzer for face I talked about
how i hated this as an actual bronzer
it's super orange and just not very cute
at all however if you do have a
foundation that's too light for you
right now the dynamic shade in the josie
maran is a little too light I have been
taking me be one pump of this with a
third of this mixing it together I don't
feel like this changes the consistency
or the actual finish of your foundation
so it's nice for mixing to darken things
up a little bit so if you had a sample
of that and you didn't like it as an
actual bronzer try using it for that
alright the next item I have been loving
is from victoria's secret to this is a
hydrating body lotion in the coconut
milk sent I was going to say it smells
like milk and coconut but no seriously
it smells like a coconut cupcake smells
really really amazing i'm using this in
my project pan currently i don't feel
like i'm gonna have any issue going
through it it's really nice because it
actually sinks in instantly on the body
so that has been a lot of fun to use
this week i also have been adoring my
Urban Decay advice for college that this
is my all-time favorite probably one of
my all-time favorite eyeshadow palettes
from urban decay it is a little more
difficult to work with but it is
definitely worth it once you come out
with some really really gorgeous looks I
love the tones in here my two favorite
shades are fastball and also flame so
there's fastball there is flame they're
so beautiful on the actual eyes and if
you foil them they look even better so
there are my two favorite shades and i
know i didn't get to look of the week
this week which was sad but i will get
to look of the week next week and we
will be playing around with that
two-face palette that i reviewed
yesterday alright moving on i also have
been loving my Urban Decay color
correcting fluid in the shade peach I've
been using this underneath my eyes it
has been a long ass week you guys i've
been getting probably four hours of
sleep monday tuesday wednesday thursday
friday i was getting about four hours of
sleep on average and i was waking up
with really dark under eye circles so
that was great really enjoyed it i also
have been loving my aqua extra large I
pencil from make up forever in the shade
m80 this is a beautiful plummy color I
feel like these we're pretty
well on the eyes they're not as good as
some of my other eye liner so we'll see
how i feel when declutter series comes
if i feel like i do want to get rid of
them maybe i will but we shall see i
also have been loving my NYX do we
finished long-lasting setting spray I
feel like these knicks long-lasting
setting sprays in the map version and
also in the Douay version are just as
good if not better than the Urban Decay
one so I just wanted to put that out
there I know right now or decay is
having a great deal where you can get to
full sizes for the price of one which I
would definitely pick that up I probably
will pick that up but I just wanted to
say I feel like there are some really
really good setting sprays at the
drugstore and that wet and wild 12 is
absolutely fantastic so I don't really
feel the need to go and pick up a
high-end one all right I've been loving
this elf mineral blush pressed mineral
blush in the shade wanderlust this is
what I have on my cheeks today it is a
beautiful beautiful kind of berry ish
color I just love the way this goes on
these are so smooth and creamy and it
does have a little bit of Sheen to it
like I said that's what I'm wearing
today they are a little powdery because
they are so finely milled and soft but
for the most part that has been a
wonderful blush what I like to do is
really apply it with a fluffy brush so
that it doesn't go on too crazy on to my
actual I was in staying on to my eyes
nope so that I doesn't go too pigmented
on to my cheeks i also have been loving
the Makeup Forever aqua extra large I
pencil in the shade m10 this is just a
jet-black it's what I have on my
waterline and also my tight line today
if i were to declutter one of these it
would probably be the plummy shade i
probably would keep this one because i
love a good eyeliner pencil that's black
alright moving on i've been loving my
urban decay of ice uh junkie no not
junkie i'm sorry this is the black male
lipstick palette today i am wearing
these shades conspiracy paired with
sheer shame and this is what they look
like so that shade conspiracy with all
that one which is sheer shame they look
so beautiful i love that you can create
any sort of lip look that you want with
these they're just absolutely stunning
and I feel like they wear a really long
time they look so pretty on the lips and
I cannot wait to get the gem t palette I
did order that so very excited for that
i also have been loving my makeup geek
kathleenlights collaboration
this is a really really nice lightweight
natural highlighting palette in my
opinion my favorite shade this week has
definitely been the one in the middle
which is called star lights then we have
night light here and sunlight here
they're all really beautiful they do
have a little bit of Sheerness to them
so if you do like a more natural-looking
heilige you would absolutely adore this
palette if you do want to build that
highlight up you can use a more dense
brush but I've just been using it with a
fan brush this week and I've been very
happy i also have been loving my elf
high definition under ice setting powder
this is way better than the kat von d
translucent one in my opinion the locket
powder you do get more in the locket
powder but i will say i love the way
that this looks underneath the eyes it
really really helps to conceal and kind
of fill in fine lines and wrinkles and I
also preps your eyelid for shadow so
this is a really nice product it does
have little like glitter flecks in it
but it's nothing too noticeable I have
been loving my amazing cosmetics amazing
concealer in the hydrate version the
shade that I where is I free this is
just so smooth and creamy and beautiful
on the skin it gives a gorgeous satin
you look really nice underneath the eyes
on the eyelid and anywhere if it eyelids
and anywhere else but you wanna I like
all right girl I love to wrap this up
I've also been loving my Rimmel stay
matte long-lasting pressed powder
initiate transparent I have hit some
baby pan there as you guys can see this
is beautiful i love how Matt it keeps me
throughout the day I really really love
this powder highly highly recommend
checking that out any last two items I
have been loving our number one as the
Milani baked blush in the shade red vino
this is absolutely stunning again use a
very very fluffy brush if you do have a
fair skin tone because it's quite
pigmented but it's beautiful it's got a
little bit of golden shimmer to it I
will watch it for you guys so you can
see I just love the way it looks on the
cheeks and then I also have been loving
my yes to grapefruit dark circle
correcting eye cream this is one of my
all-time favorite eye creams it's
beautiful like i said i have not been
getting a lot of sleep like this week so
this was definitely crucial for me it
really helps to kind of brighten
underneath the eyes that kind of firms
it up a little bit and you would love
this if you do have like oily prone
eyelids if that makes sense because it
sinks in super super quickly so anyway
those Roy fails in holy grails I hope
you guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for joining me and I will see you
guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
