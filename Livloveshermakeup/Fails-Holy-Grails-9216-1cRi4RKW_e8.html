welcome back to my files and how to
write Hills where I share with you guys
any products that I have been loving
this week and the products that I have
been hating I am actually sharing with
you guys two weeks worth of fails and
holy grails because I've been rather
sick this week so I haven't been wearing
a lot of makeup but the week before that
I was wearing a lot of makeup I did not
- he fails in holy grails video and yes
normally I filmed these on Sundays and
today I was going to do those tart
reviews I keep promising them I really
shouldn't make promises that I can't
keep oh those videos will go up on
Sunday you guys and they just combined
the brush and to the actual blush the
brush and the blush the blush palette
and the brush reviews together but I'm
just not feeling it today I really just
feel like I have a small amount of
energy and I want to get this done now
so I can get you guys my fails and holy
grails but I really don't feel like I
have the energy to do two videos so
anyway I hope you guys can understand
let's go ahead and get into the past two
weeks fails and on the rails alright so
let's go ahead and start with the fails
the first one is the Lime Crime Venus
eyeshadow palettes now this is a
beautiful palette it's got gorgeous
pigmentation it doesn't have any fallout
it's got pretty colors but honestly this
looks really strange on the face really
strange on my face it is just not meant
for my skin tone you guys there were a
few videos that I filmed last week and
you guys were like damn girl looks like
you have like pink eye or something
seriously this palette I just can't it's
absolutely beautiful like I said
gorgeous packaging gorgeous gorgeous
colors but these Reds in here for some
reason on my eyes with my skin tone even
with my self tanner they just make me
look sick so I'm going to go ahead and
declutter this I will probably declutter
it to my friend Rochelle I think she
would like this particular palette but
yeah this was a no-go for me so I am
letting go of that and it was a fail for
the week the other fail for the week or
the past two weeks has been this fresh
black tea age delay cream this has
advanced antioxidants it firms protects
and hydrates the skin I've been loving
the serum and I've been loving the
instant perfecting mask but I just don't
like this it's very strange smelling it
smells like cucumber yeah like something
cucumber I don't know I don't really
like it and also it's just so greasy no
matter how much I use even if I use just
the tiniest amount like on my pinky
finger this is still incredibly
incredibly bit incredibly incredibly
greasy and I just don't like it so those
the two fails let's go ahead and get
into the Holy Grails I was gonna say
Foley Grails the hologram all right the
first one is definitely my new
maybelline superstay better skin skin
transforming powder the shade that I
have is number 10 of porcelain this is
what it looks like I really do like the
packaging I just wish that the entire
powder took up this area but this sponge
is actually quite good I like to take it
and dip it in and then just Pat over the
areas that I get greasy throughout the
day I definitely did not think I would
like that sponge but I really do enjoy
it this powder is so finely milled and
beautiful it does have cells so like
acid in it and I just love the way it
goes onto the skin normally when I get a
powder vasilich acid it looks very
chalky and dry and strange on my face
but that is an amazing powder highly
recommend checking that out all right
let's see here I have a few latias here
that I have been enjoying the past two
weeks these are from colour-pop the
first one is the ultra metallic lip in
the shade flitter I was wearing this
last week and a lot of you are
commenting that you loved that lip color
I do think the formulation is pretty
darn good it's not my favorite I'm
wearing the shades zebra right now which
is also one of the ultra metallic lips
it definitely is coming outside of my
lip line which I'm not a huge fan of I
was doing a little bit of practicing
earlier I've been talking I do have a
lip liner on and again I feel like
there's a whole lot of feathering going
on here so I don't think that these stay
very well in the lip line this is the
shade zebra but I do think they're very
pretty colors I like the metallic finish
that they give on the lips but I do
prefer these ultra glossy lips this one
is called Chi code and it's absolutely
beautiful like a burnt coppery dark
brown color really really love that I
would say that I prefer that formulation
over the ultra metallic lips alright I
have a fragrance pairing here that I
have been loving for the past two weeks
my versace bright crystal which is my
signature perfume scent mixed together
with the body fantasy's signature sweet
sunrise fantasy the two of these all
really good together
this is very very fresh smelling and
very like a vibrance and like happy and
bubbly and this one's a little more worn
but it really smells good I don't know
the mixture of those two together I
really really enjoy so been loving that
I also have been loving my Muru Muru
butter bronzer from Physicians Formula
in is the actual bronzer shade this one
is definitely a little more cool toned
maybe a little more about that doesn't
make sense
yeah wait
it's a little more cool tome the other
one is a little more red tone so it's a
little more warm tones but this one is
still really nice I do prefer the other
one like overall I do you think it's a
little better I liked a little bit I
like a little bit of more warmth to my
face but this is really nice
easy to throw onto your face really
quickly I just I'm obsessed with these
or more butter bronzers oh my god I just
dropped it okay I'm obsessed with these
more butter bronzers I think they're
absolutely beautiful if you are someone
who really likes a nice like flush of
warmth or gorgeousness on your face then
you would really really enjoy this they
smell amazing I really highly recommend
checking those out I hope they come out
with new shades I have two little
eyeliners here that I have been loving
the first is actually a cream eyeshadow
but I'm wearing it today as an eyeliner
I like to put this on my lower lash line
this is the beauty for real shadow
sticks 24/7 eyes shadow in the shade
midnight and Marathon it's a beautiful
kind of taupey color and I just love
this on my lower lash line I think it's
so so so pretty and it goes really
nicely with my little hoodie today and
all that kind of stuff so really have
been enjoying at for the past two weeks
and I have been enjoying my the balm
cosmetics mr. right now eyeliner pencil
in the shade Jack again this one has a
little more of like a warm tone to it
but again very very pretty very nice on
the waterline these actually wear an
incredibly long time so been loving the
two of those together what else have I
been loving I've been loving Pacifica
wipes you guys know I'm a big fan of
their underarm deodorant whites that
these are the coconut milk ones right
yeah coconut milk these are amazing
I love these for a days when first of
all I'm sick and I don't want to put
deodorant on I could just wipe one of
these all over my body they really do
help with body odor however I will say
they don't like help with wetness
protection that much you do have to
reapply them throughout the day but
basically they're just these fabulous
little wipes that you take out and you
put underneath your armpit or wherever
you want and I really like that they are
free of aluminum and all sorts of bad
chemicals and things like that so I've
been enjoying those and I also have been
enjoying the Pacifica excuse me oh sorry
because never got super detox deep
purification wipes these have kale
cucumber and then goes steam infused in
and I have no idea what that means but
these are awesome they kind of smell
like a green smoothie like a gross green
smoothie that you would get at Whole
Foods none of those are gross
know what I mean like greenshoe it's not
green smother green juice they smell
like spinach and parsley mixed together
I don't love the smell it still smells
pretty good but these are amazing at
removing oil removing just gross Masson
your face if you're feeling grimy these
are really really nice so I've enjoyed
those as well I have been enjoying my
two-faced love love blushes let's watch
blushes in how deep is your love and I
will always love you you guys know I
love these blushes they stay on the
cheeks forever they're gorgeous this hot
coral shade here is beautiful how deep
is your love and then this one is the
one I'm wearing today this one is I will
always love you which is like a warm
moody peach color I love to way that
this pairs with this particular
highlighter which is the next holy grail
this is the Oprah highlighter in the
Rodeo Drive shade this is new it's
beautiful it's so buttery itself smooth
I just love it it's absolutely gorgeous
and like I said I love the way that it
pairs with that particular blush I have
a skincare item here that I've been
obsessed with this is the bozo cool blue
hydration essence or hydrating essence
I've been really into like the whole
like Asian skin care thing where you
literally put like seven products on
your face in the morning and at night
and I've been putting my essence on
before my serum I literally just spit on
the camera anyway I really really
enjoyed this product I think it's
beautiful I think one dropper full put
it on my face I Pat it into my neck my
decollete I just bathe in this stuff
it's beautiful it really does hydrate
the skin before you put your serum on
and it's like a gel so this is actually
on sale at Sephora right now I did not
actually show you guys when I called
this but it's a beautiful product and it
has yeast filtrate in it whatever that
means but honestly it smells good it
does not smell like yeast it smells
really good it feels good on the skin
and it is very calming so if you do have
a lot of like rosacea or redness or very
sensitive skin you would probably enjoy
this quite a lot you could use it as
your actual serum but I've been loving
that as my essence I also have been
loving the fresh black tea instant
perfecting mask so I've been using two
different masks the past couple of weeks
this is the first one and this is one
that you can just paint on really really
quickly like over your face very quickly
and it just instantly perfects your face
it honestly does and I used to not love
this one that much you guys can see I've
really dug into this little sample I
notlikethis that much I really enjoyed
it the overnight mask and that's like
$92 and that was the one I was going to
pick up but I think I'm gonna get this
one as well it's very similar to the dr.
Brandt that the needle mote needles no
more is it dr. Brandt dr. jart dr.
Brandt dr. jart dr. Brandt needles no
more it's very similar to the instant
perfecting task that they have where you
literally just put it on and it's kind
of like an instant gratification thing
this really fills in fine lines and
pores and it's beautiful just don't
apply too much if you do want to wear it
underneath makeup and then I also have
been loving my glam glow youth mud
tingle exfoliate treatment I recently
got the sleeping mask actually came in
the mail of like yesterday I'm very very
excited I will be doing your review for
you guys on that next week but you guys
know I love glam glow and I love the
youth mud I think this is a fantastic
fantastic mask really good for
exfoliating the skin and honestly when
I'm in a lupus flare up I get a lot of
buildup and greasy Ness and grime on my
face so like I said it really been
enjoying the Pacifica wipes and also
that mask because it really helps to
take off that gross layer of disgusting
yes alright moving on I've been loving
me fresh the black th delay firming
serum I need a full size 4 this is an 82
dollar serum I don't need it full size
but I do like I need it you know what it
means like I need it but I don't need it
it's absolutely beautiful really really
gorgeous I love this actual packaging
because it goes right into the
applicator and then you just squirt it
out it gives you the perfect amount very
very thick very very luxurious if you
have mature skin or dry skin you need to
check out this serum and honestly I
notice a difference in my skin when I
use the black tea of age delay line from
fresh I really actually do I feel like
my skin looks a lot more vibrant and
younger so been enjoying that a lot I
have two mascaras that I've been pairing
together that I've been loving my
positions formula organic wear mascara
this is a really nice base mascara
I've been pairing it with the Maybelline
the falsies push-up drama which is a
very nice defining mascara very similar
to the Laura Mercier extra lash
sculpting mascara which is one of my
favorites so really enjoy that and then
the last two products are the Rimmel
stay matte liquid mousse foundation in
the shade zero one zero porcelain love
this very comparable to the Amazonian
clay the Tarte Amazonian clay full
coverage foundation this shade is really
really good very very neutral a little
light for me
right now while I do have self-tan but
perfect for me during the winter time
great coverage keeps you matte
absolutely all day and I also have been
loving my models comb or brows this is
basically just a do for the benefit
gimme brow really easy to just comb
through your brows quickly and it sets
them in place as well so anyway those
are all of them frozen Holi Grails I
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for joining me I will see
you guys tomorrow
