my channel and welcome back to my girls
and how the Gredos where I share with
you guys the products I have been loving
this week and of course the products I
have not been loving I don't have too
much to share this week but I still
wanted to walk you guys through some
products that really stood out as very
very good to me and some products that
stood out is not being so good so let's
go ahead and start with the fail the
feel for the week was actually sent over
from Olie Henrickson for me to try out
as you guys can see didn't get a lot of
progress on here because this is just
not the toner for me this is the only
Hendrickson balancing for soil control
toner it does have salicylic acid as
well as EJ's in here the reason why I
wanted this was because I did try this
guy out about a year ago I purchased
this at Sephora it's the only Hendrix in
Greece relief facial water it does also
have a little bit of lactic acid in here
goldenseal and hops extract however
these are two different toners
I really thought this was going to be
the repackaged version of this guy but
unfortunately it's not this really
stripped my skin you guys I just do not
have that combo oily skin anymore I feel
like this one is very very delicate and
nice on the skin I don't even know if
they sell this anymore but this is the
toner that I have continued to use even
after moving down here to the desert so
it works for me for all sorts of
different skin types in my opinion what
I like to do is spray it on to a cotton
pad and then rub in circular motions
they recommend you do the same thing
with this toner right here but
unfortunately you guys it's just a way
to embrace it from me toner should not
be taking away from your skin they
should be balancing out your skin so
this definitely did not work out for me
however my boyfriend who does how
competently skin has been using this the
past two nights if he really likes it so
he will be using it alright now let's go
ahead and get into the holy grails I'm
gonna start with some colour-pop
products cuz I have a lot of colour-pop
products I've been enjoying this week
the first three are eyeshadow palettes
so I definitely have been loving this
little guy right here I wore like a pink
tone smokey eye on Tuesday and Wednesday
and so many people were asking what is
on your eyes it was this baby right here
and this is the color pop belle of the
ball palette and it's just a really
really gorgeous little quartet here as
you can probably see so you have this
nice like of
Matt's peachy shade right here that a
little bit of a deeper one you have like
a dark fuchsia pink and then kind of
like a shimmery lilac light pink it's
super super beautiful and basically I
just kind of mixed all these together on
my eyes and I kind of smoked it out so
many of you were asking what was on my
eyes so that is the first one I want to
talk about and then of course also the
yesplease palette you guys know I have
been obsessed with this for quite a few
weeks now but I have really been
enjoying mixing this together with the
color pop I think I love you palette
this week I did a comparison video the
other day so I'll go ahead and throw
that up in the cards if you would like
to check it out but would highly highly
recommend you guys check out these
palettes I think they work together
beautifully in unison or together I
think they're just really really
wonderful it was my first week of back
at school again basically teaching and
I'm not really been enjoying mixing the
two of those together I feel like it's
very neutral and natural looking eye
makeup without being too overdone all
right some other products from
colour-pop that I have been loving are
these guys right here in the colour-pop
ultra blotted lip in the shade Zuma as
well as the color pop brow boss so this
is like five or six dollars it's a brow
product and I really just wanted to try
it out because I was placing an order
for the I think I love you palette the
bellow the ball palette and I thought I
would just toss that in there so I could
get some free shipping now this is what
it looks like you have a little tiny a
little kind of like a micro color and
delayed and not a blade you guys know
what I mean it's a micro pencil
okay a little tiny micro pencil on one
side on the shade I wear is blonde and
it's really nice for just filling in the
front part of your brows which is what I
like to do I like to fill in the tail
and then the front part of my brows the
rest of them are pretty good and then
you talked a little spoolie on the other
side I feel like this is a really good
do before the honest ostia Beverly Hills
brow Wiz except it's a little softer the
thing I don't like about the UH Nastasia
Beverly Hills brow is is I'm putting it
on I can literally see little eyebrows
falling off my goddamn face because it
is just such a dry pencil I feel like
this one's a little more creamy so if
you're looking into a really really nice
kind of like micro precise a brow pencil
this is a very good one
and then as far as the Ultra blotted lip
is concerned if this guy right here is
called Summa and my friend actually sent
this to me my friend ate me so thank you
baby
originally I did not like
I felt like it drag down to this very
very powdery weird a feeling and it
wasn't super opaque you guys can see
there's like a little bit of streaking
going on there but what I like to do now
is just take it and I kind of tap it
onto my lip and then I top it with a
gloss and it's beautiful I love how this
kind of blurs out the lines in your lips
it just looks really really nice on the
lips and it's actually relatively
comfortable if you do pair it together
with a claw so that is the colour-pop
ultra blotted lip into the shade of Zuma
hurry guys I'm moving on as far as
highlight and blush are concerned this
week I basically only been wearing this
little compact right here and this is
one of the Becca Jaclyn hill split pans
now you could get both of these colors
in full size so I thought I would still
recommend it and talk about it so right
here we have flower child which is one
of their mineral blushes it is so
freaking a beautiful if you do have like
a fair complexion a light complexion or
a medium complexion I think you would
love that blush if you're a little
deeper it might look slightly actually
on your skin
however champagne pop is really nice if
you have a light medium and deep
complexion as far as highlighting is
concerned if you're super super fair or
porcelain it might be a little dark on
you right now I'm able to pull this off
as a highlight but this is just a great
pairing right here one of the most
universally flattering beautiful blushes
right here well not really universally
flattering like I said I don't know how
good it would look on a very deep
complexion but I feel like this is just
a really really all together really nice
little eye duo right here and I really
have been enjoying it alright moving on
I have some more lip products here a lot
of you have been wondering what liquid
lipsticks I've been wearing to have that
metallic finish and they are crumb at
the megalast collection the midnight
mermaid collection from wet and wild so
these are the liquid catsuit and
metallic matte lipsticks in the shades
coral crown as well as this one right
here which is called Harper a crush I
really love these I love the way they go
on again if you feel like they're a
little drying you can pair them together
with a gloss but that is what does the
coral crown shape looks like on me it's
definitely a little deeper and I feel
like these dudes write down a little
darker just to give you a little bit of
a heads-up and then her brush definitely
has that perfect like cranberry kind of
hue to it and it's a little deeper
meaning more like a wine color it leaves
on my skin tone so I've really been
enjoying those I find these very very
comfortable and I'm very picky when it
comes to liquid lipstick so I wanted to
go ahead and share those with you
up next we actually have you perfume
here now I know this is not cruelty-free
I want to find a cruelty-free do for it
if it smell so good but this is
the tory burch for you but now my
boyfriend's relatives got this for me
for a my birthday actually maybe for
Christmas like yeah if it goes for
Christmas and it's just a gorgeous
smelling perfume it's very very floral E
but a like also kind of spicy it's just
that perfect mix and you smell very like
sophisticated or at least I feel like I
smell sophisticated when I wear this so
I've been loving my Tory Burch perfume
and finally guys I have a highlighting
concealer brush right here and now I
want to start by saying I love the by
Terry brand and I'm very thankful that
they sent this over to me for PR but
this is not something that I love but
it's also not something that I hate so
this is called the Toshiba loot or to
shoot a highlighting concealer brush
there are so many good things about this
product you guys so many good things one
of the things that's not so great is the
packaging I'm not a huge fan of this
like push down here and then you know
you have kind of had the gross little
brush that probably is harboring a ton
of bacteria or like a little sponge tip
applicator however when you actually get
this onto the skin you're like oh my god
it's so beautiful it reminds me a lot of
the YSL click pen in the tushy cloth
version if you guys have ever tried that
I tried that out a few years ago before
going cruelty free it's gorgeous it's
very much like a second skin and it just
gives really nice brightening properties
and this particular shade right here is
called one porcelain and I love by Terry
like I said I really enjoy that they are
a cruelty free and also just kind of
like a high-end or like a luxury company
I really feel like these products are
very luxury luxurious luxurious
luxurious but I have to say you guys
there is one big con to this oh my god
and that is the scent
this is way too overwhelming this
particular scent is way too overwhelming
I do not understand why you need that
much fragrance in a little product like
this it kind of smells like my grandma's
perfume or something like that like way
back in the day very very dated
fragrance and it's not even like that
kind of center where you smell like
lipsticks and it's like kind of nice and
you have like a little bit of like a
creamy undertone a little bit of
of vanilla sense it's straight-up like
grandma's perfumes that it gives me a
headache it is something that lasts on
my skin for a good 45 minutes like the
fragrance sits there on my face around
my eye area and I just can't stand it I
just can't stand it I love everything
about this this is the kind of concealer
that I would look for in my collection
but I gotta say by Terry like what the
 why why would the fragrance it's
just so completely unnecessary and this
is not something I would recommend to
you guys it's not something that I would
purchase with my own money because of
that and I know that might be a little
nitpicky I'm somebody who can handle a
lot of fragrance but that is not worth
it so anyway guys I hope you enjoyed
this video thank you so much for joining
me for my weekly favorites and I will
see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
