my channel and welcome back to my brows
and holograms where I share with you
guys the products I have been loving
this week and of course the products I
have not been loving I also am sneaking
in a little bit of a review here or not
a review my final thoughts so I thought
I would go ahead and do this first this
was sent to me in exchange for an honest
review from colour-pop as well as octoly
this is the weekend warrior pressed
powder shadow collection from colour-pop
so this is what the outer packaging
looks like I did show you guys this
probably about two and a half weeks ago
I kind of say guys I'm not super
impressed I do like that there is a very
very small ingredients list here and I
do like the names of the shades I think
the outer packaging is cute I wish they
would have popped a mirror in there I
just don't see the point of having it I
just I don't file it if you don't put in
a mirror but that's just me I think what
I'm not impressed with is definitely the
color selection these are just not
colors that I would wear on a day-to-day
basis I mean I'm I'm home for the day
today this is a pre film video that you
guys are seen but you can see on a
day-to-day basis I don't wear that much
makeup I do wear eyeshadows on a
day-to-day basis but like today being at
home I would never like pop on a dark
smoky color like this so nothing against
people who love to wear dark smoky
shades is just this is not really my
kind of color selection also I do find
that the formulation on this seems to be
a little inconsistent these shimmery
shade right here definitely goes on very
very patchy and then the three mats are
also different so this one right here is
quite nice and then this one is here
right through is quite nice but this
shade right here which is like the
burnout shade which is a little more of
like a dark turquoise is not so I just I
don't really like it I don't know if
this is the same exact ingredients that
they are using in the new singles that
they released but for the most part guys
I would say pass on this this is just
not that great alright now let's go
ahead and get into the fails and holy
grails so I actually don't have any
fails this week I have in between
products and I know that I shouldn't
actually be talking about them because
it's all about fails or holy grails but
these are just products that I have been
liking this week I don't hate them I
don't love them but I just want to share
that so let's go ahead and jump right
into it and the first is definitely the
it cosmetics your skin but better CC
illumination full coverage cream I just
don't think this looks that flattering
on my skin I have definitely gotten into
work a little better this week I have
been applying it with a damp sponge or
with my fingertips I definitely need a
really good primer as well as an oil to
combine into this but I don't know guys
it's just not as beautiful as the
original formulation of my
piñon if you aren't going to pick up
one of the CC creams get the one in the
silver tube do not get this one it
actually does have little micro glitters
in it and I don't find that flattering
on the skin no matter what even if you
have dry skin or oily skin I don't think
it looks flattering so although I have
gotten it to work this week and I will
finish it off this is not something that
I would repurchase and if you are
curious I do wear the shade of fair
alright the next item that is just okay
was also sent to me for an honest review
in exchange I'm sorry in exchange for an
honest review from actively as well as
the Korres brand this is called the
instant brightening and illuminating
mask and I just think this is okay
nothing too special I do like the
overall feel that it gives on my skin I
do think it makes my skin softer when I
take it off it's a nice mask experience
but for the most part I do not see any
sort of brightening or illuminating
effects when I use this they do say it's
supposed to give you instant
gratification did not notice instant
gratification the first time I used it
and then I used it for the whole entire
week and didn't notice that much of a
difference I have been dealing with a
lot of hyperpigmentation lately because
I just got out of a lupus flare up and
I'm usually left with some melasma as
well as darker you know parts on my skin
and I just don't feel like this did
anything exceptional if that makes sense
so I would not recommend this especially
because it does cost like fifty or sixty
dollars at Sephora and then finally the
last two products that were just made
for me this week we're definitely the
Physicians Formula Muru Muru butter
blushes I don't like the colors of these
even when I layer them together they
definitely look better when I layer them
I would not wear them on their own by
themselves whatever I think I will use
this little guy right here natural glow
more as a highlighting shade it's a
peachy color with a little bit of a gold
earring essence but the plum rose shade
I don't like this on my cheeks so I
think I'll maybe try these as eyeshadows
we shall see
I think the formulation is beautiful
very very soft and creamy and buttery
just like the bronzers but until they
release more colors I do not think I
will be purchasing any more of these now
a Physicians Formula is a cruelty-free
brand which i think is great from the
drugstore but I just wish they had a
different color selection all right
let's go ahead and get into the stuff
that I have been loving the first item
is my Burberry got hair in my mouth the
first item is my Burberry perfume this
is just the Eau de Toilette for women or
whatever it smells amazing I even find
this for years I feel like a woman when
I wear this fragrance but unfortunately
I do not think Burberry is the
cruelty-free Brown so I will not be I
will not be repurchasing but it smells
amazing
nice kind of like woman in power sort of
sent if that makes sense so I really do
enjoy this I also have been loving at
the bath &amp;amp; Bodyworks aromatherapy stress
relief sandalwood rose body wash and
foam baths as the favorites time to find
you guys it's absolutely beautiful it is
a little more of a mature scent so if
you do not like that typical rose and
kind of like powdery sort of combination
you may not like this but I do use this
when I'm feeling a little down whether
it's physically or mentally I do feel
like any sort of scent that you're in
love with can technically be like an
aromatherapy kind of stuff because it
makes you happy when you're spelling it
so yeah this is beautiful I've always
loved this scent from Bath and Body
Works definitely my all-time favorite I
wish they would make this in three week
handle form I also have really been
enjoyed my makeup revolution vivid baked
highlighter in the shade golden lights I
do notice that this scens can sometimes
look a little chunky on my skin it's so
so so pigmented like really really
pigmented so you do have to be careful
but if you apply it with a fan brush and
you really kind of buff it into the skin
it looks absolutely beautiful so I would
highly recommend checking this one out I
did not like the peach lights or the
pink lights formulas I did feel like
they were different than this one but
this one is very very beautiful just be
careful if you're super dry alright I
also have been loving my L'Oreal miss
manga rack it will not be pre purchasing
obviously because L'Oreal is not cruelty
free and also uh um you know this is no
longer sold anymore they actually
discontinued this but I am definitely
going to be keeping the wand the wand is
what I think is so special I'm gonna be
tossing this in my empties i was a-sayin
my empties video into my empties bin
after this video because it just got so
clumpy and clumpy towards the end here
that I can't really wear it on my lashes
anymore but it was a wonderful mascara I
really did enjoy it and can't wait to
keep that little eye brush alright I
also have been loving my Tarte
rainforest at the seat aqua sealer one
of the reasons why I feel like that CC
cream has looked relatively good on my
skin this week is because of this
rainforest at the sea aqua sealer it's
just beautiful you do have to shake it
up quite a bit before you put it on but
it really has a nice nice consistency
and texture to it very water like it
smells like paint which is disgusting
but it's beautiful so there is the
little swatch of it the fair shades
blends in really really nicely into my
skin tone maybe has a little bit of a
pink undertone but so so beautiful on
the skin and
I'm just someone on a day-to-day basis I
wear more natural makeup so that is
wonderful I also have been loving at
this little guy right here this is a
cognac sponge paired together with my
bozhe detoxifying black cleanser cannot
believe the bozhe is not cruelty-free I
really thought they would be but they
are not but this is amazing it actually
warms up and heats up on your skin and
there are definitely cruelty free
products that you can find that I also
heat up on the skin and I will
definitely recommend one to you guys I
think there's one from the be fine
organic skincare line they have like a
heating cleanser I'm gonna try that one
out next but yeah this is a really
really nice product and I loved how nice
and hot it got when I did put it on with
this little guy right here so this is a
cognac sponge that actually came in my
PopSugar must-have box for the month
it's beautiful it's kind of one of those
things where you can kind of choose how
much exfoliation you want because it's
hard as a rock right now but then when
you run it underneath warm water it
really really softens up so you can kind
of get a half damp or you can get it all
the way damp and then a really really D
night gets nice and soft you just
massage it into the skin it's beautiful
you don't need a Luna you don't need a
Clarisonic you can get something kind of
similar to a cleansing experience with
this so that is really cool I also have
been loving the Josie Maran Argan
infinity intensive creamy oil this stuff
is insane you guys so beautiful if you
are very very dry it does say it has
argan oil in it 100% it has a vitamin E
and also it does have essential fatty
acids if you have extremely dry
dehydrated skin I would recommend this
it's beautiful it's healing and I think
from now on I don't keep getting hair in
my mouth
I think from now on when I do have a
lupus flare up I'm gonna go ahead and
apply this because I do notice that this
helps a little bit with breakouts and it
really helps to calm down the skin so
have been loving that I also have been
enjoying this this is the Brazilian boom
boom cream or here in the US we say bum
bum cream from these sol de janeiro
brands now this was also a product that
was sent to me from the sol de janeiro
as well as octal e brand in exchange for
an honest review of this is a really
cool product you guys it is supposed to
be something that helps to firm up your
body a lot of people say oh it's a bum
bum cream you know if you use it on the
back of your ass if you have cellulite
or things like that
I really don't notice a difference when
I use it on the areas that I do kind of
want to firm up I do have larger upper
arms and things like that a you stirred
around my bosom area I'm very apple
shaped you guys so I kind of carry my
weight in this area the stuff that you
guys see on camera
so I used it in that area a little bit
on my stomach to see if it would help
with a little bit of stretch marks and
even just a little bit of cellulite in
general in that area and then on my
thighs and also on my bum did not notice
the difference whatsoever have been
using it for two and a half weeks
non-stop however it smells amazing it is
a mixture of pistachio and caramel
that's sent like that's aromatherapy
right there I like it makes me feel good
it just smells amazing it's very very
moisturizing and it does leave you with
a little bit of a sheen or a glow so I'm
actually gonna take this to Hawaii with
me and I would consider purchasing a
full size based on the scent and the
moisturization and the glow so although
it doesn't firm I do think it's a nice
product so I have been loving that I
have also been loving the color pop what
is this ultra metallic lip in the shade
fritter so this is what it looks like it
is so beautiful you guys I love this
color it's just like a true rose gold I
don't know how else to describe it it is
a little drying on my lips I have been
following it up with the by Terry Baume
two rows but for the most part it's just
so nice it's so so beautiful the way it
goes onto the lips and when you first
apply it it really really looks nice so
yeah that is the color and it's just the
color is so unique if they were to come
out with like a tinted lip balm in this
color that would be amazing
and finally the last item that I have
been loving that I will not get a
full-size of is the fresh a vitamin
nectar vibrancy boosting face mask
unfortunately fresh is not a
cruelty-free brand that was very very
surprising to me I'm sorry if I sound
like a broken record lately just talking
about cruelty free cruelty free but I do
think it's important for me to raise
awareness about that and kind of tell
you guys which brands are cruelty free
and which are not and unfortunately
fresh is not I was very surprised
because they claimed to be a more
natural kind of skincare brand but yeah
they test on animals so anyway that is
what it looks like it is a beautiful
mask it kind of feels like jelly or
marmalade when you're putting it on your
skin it smells amazing I would just love
if they could make this curl 40 free
that cruelty free so anyway sorry guys
I've been doing pre filming today so I
feel like I'm kind of all over the place
but thank you so much for joining me I
hope that you guys enjoyed this video
and I will see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
