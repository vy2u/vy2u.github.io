channel thank you so much for joining me
I hope you are all having a fantastic
day
I don't know okay I'm probably gonna be
playing with my hair a lot in this page
you hear that that was like my joints
cracking old lady over here alright
welcome back to my channel thank you so
much for joining me I really hope you
guys are having a fantastic weekend oh
geez yeah thanks a kid to show you guys
I'm not excited about this the flow my
nails but I am here to share my faileth
and holy grails for the week yes I am
filming on a different camera I'm sorry
I lost my SD card okay it's like a
little it's like this type of a chick
actually it's like half the size of chip
and I mean who knows maybe my roommate I
don't know what happened to it but I
feel like I shouldn't be blamed for it
being lost because it's so small and
thin and slender I'm just like well of
course anybody's gonna lose that right I
show that type of music too anyway my
boyfriend dad he's like a cyborg he
loves electronics he has like six extra
SD cards however he is sleeping right
now he is a doctor and he was on call
and I don't want to wake him up he was
working overnight all night and he'll
just be mean so I am filming on this
camera please forgive me I will be back
to you know normal schedule I will be
back to filming on my regular camera
tomorrow because it won't give me an SD
card so anyway I make everything by eyes
so what works for me and what didn't
work for me this week I don't have that
much I really didn't use that many
products this week I used a lot of
makeup skincare not really which is
probably why my skin has been acting up
but anyway let's start with the products
that it did not work for me the first
one just discussing so I think did my
nails last night last night
it just chipped right away and it's
annoying because I didn't put a top coat
on it was the elf top coat you know I
don't know much about nail polish so
should I get like that session eat one
or whatever it's called if you guys have
a good recommendation leave it below
because I love this forever 21
nail polish three coats of this is
beautiful it's like a green base
and it has multi colored glitter in it
and it's called green multi collect
litter anyway it is just great with
multicolored shimmers in it it's
beautiful but I mean it chips right away
and I was just so bothered by the fact
that it shipped like not not even within
24 hours I was like I'm not replying
that they have to see the proof so that
was definitely a fail however I'm gonna
try it with like a different topcoat I
don't know if the elf topcoat is
actually that good let me know down
below this type of thing that did not
work for me this week and it's weird
because this works for me I think it
just didn't work with the powder that I
was using or the setting spray this is
the Maybelline Dream velvet soft matte
hydrating foundation my shade is the
number 10 porcelain ivory dis oxidized
like hell on my face this week it was
just straight-up pink and I don't know
what the deal is because I love this
foundation I gave it a great review I
did a whole review on it I mean I was
like this is great it's wonderful
umm I really didn't have a lot of
complaints about it and now I'm finding
out that the shape match doesn't
necessarily work depending on like what
powder I used to set it with which is
strange because I used my Holy Grail
powder to set it with this week and that
is the up tone correcting powder in cool
and this makes all of my foundations
look amazing I love this you can see
I've hit pan yet again I found some like
20 of these so strange to me of course
I'm going to you know hold on to it and
use it with a different powder but it's
either that or maybe the setting spray I
have had setting sprays kind of oxidized
colors on my face before the one I used
this week is the Wet n Wild photo focus
I'm sweating spray and I want to think
that it wasn't this because I'm obsessed
with it I love this so hopefully it
wasn't that and hopefully it wasn't the
elf tone correcting powder that's just
strange because that is like holy breath
okay alright let's talk about some
things that we're holy grails for me I
just stand ready so I'm freaking powder
Holy Grail this one also Holy Grail this
is what I'm wearing on my eyes today and
this is the Stila palette this is the
eyes are the window shadow palette in
the shade body mmm I am loving this so
these are not buttery they are not easy
to
but look at those shapes like can you
name another palette that has those kind
of shades in it like that kind of range
form like that steel gray color to the
bright blue to like that pastel e blue
shade like you can this is a really
unique palette and I love it because it
gives color to your eyes but it's subtle
color like I am wearing um that dark
green shade today and the blue shade
that dark green and that blue up there
you can tell it's very subtle you can
tell there's blue on my eye but not like
straight up you know like super super
blue like Urban Decay blue or something
like that you don't mean it's just very
subtle and I really like it and I think
that's a very special palette like I
said formulation is not my favorite but
that's okay I did use my Too Faced
shadow insurance glitter glue on with a
bee shadow so maybe that's why it wasn't
blending as well because this is the
very techy sticky sticky primer but I
love it because it will make your
eyeshadow stand all day all day long
I've been wearing makeup for about eight
nine hours really early today so yeah um
everything is just in place no pre see
it's amazing I love this it does make
the shadows difficult like it makes them
a little tackier and harder to blend but
holy grail alright let's talk about lip
products this week because you guys have
been commenting oh is that cashmere oh
is that Salem yes I've been wearing the
Lime Crime yeah so what I'm wearing
right now is Salem
I love this color is just a beautiful
like brown color and it works for a lot
of different skin tones I really didn't
think it was going to work for my pale
skin but I like it I like the way it
looks on me so if you think it looks
good on me as well maybe I'm just like
oh yeah it's great great girl and it's
like this second one I have is write it
which is a beautiful your lips a better
sort of shape Kylie Jenner asked really
really gorgeous and then it has mirror
which I got a lot of compliments on at
the past three videos that I got yeah
the past few videos I put up yeah I was
wearing this and everybody was like can
hear on your legs it's a beautiful kind
of gray Toby
color and it looks different on every
single skin tone I think it looks best
on medium skin tones but I think it
still looks pretty on pale skin and I
love the formulations are wearing this
like I said for eight hours I have not
touched this up and it is starting to
wear off around like the inner look you
can see that the inner part of the lip
but I mean the color is still there
it doesn't feel super dry it's really
really an amazing formula let's talk
about illuminators because this Dior one
is it is the Dior skin nude air blowing
Pardons illuminating powder and spheres
are one boy pink I feel bad showing this
because this is sold out everywhere
right now it is so gorgeous you guys
like I did a whole review on the look
like this girl like this is beautiful if
you have fair skin you need this you see
that it's just so L blessing and bright
and beautiful I only have a little bit
on the cheekbones today but it's like a
gorgeous glow and that packaging oh do
you not with your scene or do you or
knows how to do it right like I feel
like theory like you know old movie star
ish when I like to play with their
packaging because it comes in like a
little velvet pouch like okay alright
moving on I have a blush here that I'm
wearing today torrone why there's no lid
for this others this is the jordana
blush in 41 hot raspberry I love this
beautiful the Jordana blushes are
amazing they're really really good is
the beautiful max color
I think it's on 299 399 at the drugstore
I've also been loving my Laura Geller
um baked blush and brighten in Roseberry
this is if I want a little more
luminosity to the skin it has like a
built-in illuminator basically kind of
little gold particles I still put the
Dior one on with this one but it's
really really beautiful kind of rosy
mouth color and then loving this one
which is normally like a blush I reach
for during the summertime is it the
ambient lighting blush in diffused heat
from hourglass it's really kind of a
summery color it's got the yellowish
powder the ambient lighting powder mixed
in with that kind of Coralie shade but
it really makes it look like you just
went on like a run or something because
it's like it just looks like you just
heat heat all right I'm moving on
wild color icon contouring palette that
they be formulated no no no that's not
okay and you got rid of the fur you know
this isn't my favorite this has been
caramel toffee and they have
reformulated this it's sad because I've
made quite a dent in not highlighting
shape but the contouring shade is
beautiful on fair skin I have it all
around the outer perimeter of my face
today and it's like never a noticeable
you know anything it's for fair girls
just got their faces nice and I can't
believe that they changed the
formulation like literally my friend Amy
got it and she's watched it from you
know it's like a dark like orange Iran
see she I mean it looks orange on my
skin tone but it's super warm and it
just the other one is like a banana
shade and I can't even wear a banana
shade rant alright for my brows I was
trimming my brows and I literally took
like a chunk right out of this one can't
tell because I've been using this pencil
but yeah I was just like what did you do
I was like that's what I get for
trimming my brows with my right hand I'm
left-handed I should never do that but
this is the beach cosmetics studio Pro
HD brow pencil I love it it's got a
really micro fine little point on one
side and and it's amazing I love it I've
never tried the I'm Safi one and we
never will because each cosmetics is so
great when it comes to their so I'm
looking to see if there's any more
typically I'm sorry but they are amazing
when it comes to their brow pencils yes
that blonde shade is perfect if you have
kind of like an ashy undertone in your
hair or in your coloring you if your
cool undertone even you would really
really like the BH Cosmetics right
angles yeah I'm not all right
these are swatch right here on my hand
these are the Lancome let's see
drama liquify pencils in the shade coat
desu and I'm today and um play is the
purple one in the coach's job is the
blue one these are so amazing they're
kind of like this deal of how you can't
tell that I'm wearing that purple shade
on my waterline
right now but there's
creamy and soft and they skate all day
on the waterline they remind me of the
Earth Day 24-hour you know
pencils 24-hour 24/7 glide-on eye
pencils those arms like my all-time
favorite so I mean you have to get a few
of these these were 100 point hurts I'd
rather just get the Urban Decay when I
know these are quite pricey
all right before mascara this week I've
been layering two one dry mascara and
one black mascara so Too Faced better
than sex love this it's got a very dry
formula so it's really nice that's like
the first coat of mascara and I have
been topping it with the Urban Decay
perversion bigger blacker batter yeah
perversion mascara really wet formula
beautiful brush it's like a natural
bristle brush I normally don't like
those buttons
alright I'm moving on this little
chapstick right here this would be
Burt's Bees grapefruit osmosis open girl
it smells so good it smells like
grapefruit and I've had him really two
half years have you don't judge me don't
judge me
yes two and a half years um I just love
him so much I can't get rid of him um it
just smells so good and I like that he
started to like dry out after work he
it's starting to dry out after a while
and honestly it's like the best lip
primer ever so if you are looking for
something that will prime or looks like
before you put like a liquid lipstick on
get one of the Burt's Bees chapstick let
them dry out for about two years and
they go all right moving on such a small
pile normally I am talking for like 45
minutes but rather wake up 12 minutes
all right guys I've been used to the
vibe right here this would be glam glow
use my tingle exfoliate treatment
definitely not for sensitive skin it
really does tingle um smells so good
definitely has some green tea in there I
just don't like when the leaves start to
fall off all only in second row since I
can't just like get a formula that will
make the leaves stick to your face not
the point but it's amazing um I really
think it helps just like clear out my
pores it definitely
resurfaces the skin and it smells really
good
I love that all right oh yes okay so I
told you the dream velvet wasn't working
for me this week so I went and grabbed
my covergirl outlast stay fabulous in
805 this is great I remember when this
used to be like the highest coverage
foundation at the drugstore and then
l'oreal infallible Pro matte came along
so this is I would say medium to
buildable coverage whereas the Loreal
Pro matte can be like full coverage so I
know I used to like the obsessed with
this and I'm just like okay
Sony mate that is what I was wearing um
so that was kind of like a fail and Holy
Grail just like me it's just okay
alright and the last thing alright the
last thing is this little guy right here
or began 8.5 2 ounces of the Peter
Thomas Roth glycolic acid three percent
facial wash oil-free anti-aging cleanser
alpha hydroxy acid Pro vitamin b5
elegans although he put all these claims
there but yes this is really good about
three percent glycolic acid it really
helps exfoliate the skin definitely
clears up any sort of congestion and
breakouts all that kind of stuff so I've
been loving that at night and that is
that guys mostly makeup this week I hope
you guys enjoyed this video I will be
back to filming on my camera tomorrow I
know I have to keep like touching to
make sure like everything's still on but
I will be back to building on my camera
tomorrow thank you so much for joining
me and I'll see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
