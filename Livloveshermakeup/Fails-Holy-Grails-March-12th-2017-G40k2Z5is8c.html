my channel and welcome back to my
bridles and how to grails where I share
with you guys the products I have been
loving this week and of course the
products I have not been loving we are
going to start with the fail I really
wanted to love this I got this in a
subscription box a few months ago it is
the hard as you coup lovers baby perfume
I believe this is like the Gwen Stefani
brand or something like that when I
smell it straight from the bottle I'm
like yeah I love that I love it and then
I put it on and I get a massive headache
when I wear this fragrance you guys let
me know if you would like to see a
perfume declutter I probably won't film
that until after I move or something
like that which by the way I will have a
life update coming up soon if you're
curious as to where I'm moving kneeling
meaning as to where I'm moving and
things like that I will let you guys
know but yeah this just gives me a
massive headache and I just can't deal
with fragrances like that so that is the
feel for the week that is the only fail
for the week thank goodness let's go
ahead and get into the Holy Grail so the
first one is Mike Freeman of feeling
beautiful clay mask with mint and lemon
I love this oh my goodness look at the
color of that it's really really bright
on camera this is great it does clear
breakouts and minimize the appearance of
pores it smells super super nice like
tea and I just really really enjoyed the
way my skin looks after I use it I also
have been loving on my Kat Von D of
metal mats palette you guys know I'm
obsessed with this particular palette it
is so beautiful you have some nice
gorgeous off foil shades on the top and
then on the bottom you have a bunch of
matte shades and they aren't just so
good you guys they are really easy to
blend there are only a few shades in
here that I would say are a little
trickier to work with the first one is
definitely ribbon and then also stone is
a little tricky to work with so stone
and then ribbon but the rest of them are
super beautiful very very creamy very
gorgeous I don't think you can get this
anymore but if you did get your hands on
it I'm sure you're happy because it's
amazing
alright the next item that I have been
loving is actually a combination this is
my Estee Lauder Double Wear stay in
place foundation paired together with my
Becca shimmering skin Perfector in
moonstone it's what I have on my face
today I just love the subtle beautiful
coverage that it gets me I feel like
this kind of sheers this foundation out
to a nice level where it doesn't look
too cakey but I also used a little bit
of glow to the skin so if you do have
the two of these I would highly
recommend layering them together or not
layering them but mixing them together
I take about probably a pea-sized amount
of this and then mix it in with this and
I just love the way it looks on my skin
all right I also have been loving this
ponds claret to be three dark spot
correcting cream it says it diminishes
dark spots and evens the skin tone for
normal to dry skin out my friend
Rochelle actually gave this to me and
I'm almost done with it I have really
really been enjoying this I have just
the tiniest amount left I will say the
fragrance is way too overpowering I just
can't even put this on in the morning
because I feel like I'm in a puke like
that's how strong and overpowering the
fragrances but I do like to wear it on
my face at nighttime I don't think it's
very good for normal to dry skin
honestly I think Rochelle told me she
has very dry skin and I think she told
me that she did not think that this was
moisturizing enough for her and I can
understand why because this sinks in
incredibly quickly I think this is
better for those of you who do have more
combination to oily skin it's really
really beautiful and overall I'm very
happy with it so that has been a lot of
fun to use this week I also have been
loving my skin today via post makeup
recovery spray I've been using this as a
setting spray and also just as a facial
mess pretty much all week long this was
sent to me from Scandinavia and octa Lee
in exchange for an honest review
basically PR and I really don't like it
like just as a spray to actually remove
breakouts and things like that I know it
has a witch hazel and like tea tree oil
or something in it but I don't find that
it does anything a special for my skin
after I've removed my makeup so I just
use it as an actual setting spray and
facial mist throughout the day and it
works really really well I like that
it's not filled with alcohol I feel like
a lot of setting sprays are so this is
just a really nice item I have been
loving I also have been loving my
Anastacio Beverly Hills Nicole Guerrero
glow kids I know there are some of you
out there that are having a difficult
time with this you've been saying that
it leaves like glitter particles on your
face I just haven't noticed that and it
really makes me question whether or not
on a Stassi of Beverly Hills is like
sending out the same palette to
everybody because I swear to you I don't
have glitter particles on my face when I
wear this so I'm not quite sure what is
going on there if there are different
palettes going out hopefully not I would
hate to think that on associate Beverly
Hills has turned into one of those
brands but this is a beautiful beautiful
palette I feel like a lot of the shades
in here will work for every single skin
tone the only thing that I have heard is
that if you do have more dry or mature
skin this does cling on to dry patches
and emphasize fine lines and wrinkles I
notice if I over apply it definitely
does but I just like to use this more
subtly because honest
a little goes a very long way with this
palette I also have been enjoyed my to
powder blushes this week this one right
here is a lyrics cinematic what is this
called a color source buildable blush it
is a beautiful beautiful terracotta
shade and then also my illamasqua Kati
blush this is a powder blush now I am
wearing this today honestly it looks
like I'm not even wearing blush on my
cheeks this is a little too light for me
right now when I do have just a tiniest
bit of tan going on so I don't think
that I should be using this like during
the summer time but I want to at my
playlist this looks absolutely beautiful
on my cheeks and it actually is
noticeable I also have been loving this
little mascara combo here the Bobbie
Brown what is this called smokey eye
mascara this is a really interesting
very very basic looking wand but for
some reason you really makes my lower
lashes stand out
I've been pairing that together with my
L'Oreal voluminous feline mascara which
I love the packaging on this look at the
packaging so gorgeous this doesn't do a
whole lot for my lashes when I use it by
itself which is very surprising because
look at that wand you would think that
would give a lot of definition and
length and volume I actually don't
notice that it does however the two of
these layer together give you a really
nice lash look I do have them on today
and I just really liked the way they
looked paired together so I've been
loving those I also have been loving my
it cosmetics feel the moment anti-aging
ultra hydrating sensory waking primer
serum I have to say it fast like that it
is just really really wonderful it
smells amazing this is my all-time
favorite primer of life I've been using
it as an eye primer this week I have
been using it as a face primer it's
beautiful it has a little bit of Dometic
own slip to it I feel like it would work
for dry skin normal skin Combusken and
more like aging skin as well if you are
super super oily you want to use just
the tiniest amount of this but it's nice
it kind of fills in the pores it
hydrates it smells good and it does have
skincare benefits in this little bottle
as well which is awesome so I've been
loving that I also have been loving on
my two little lippies now this one I
don't know this color just kind of
throws me off I'm wearing it today I
don't know if I really look good in a
cool tone pink like lip color but this
is the maybelline color elixir in these
Shane hibiscus Haven this is what it
looks like this is just a really really
pretty lip color I do think that this
formula reminds me a lot of the NARS
Velvet lip glide formulas so if you are
looking from set for something at the
drugstore that is around the same kind
of formula a lot cheaper but like very
very creamy and pretty
the lips kind of like a hybrid between a
lipgloss and a lipstick I do think these
are nice again I just think I kind of
chose a weird color for me personally
but I have been enjoying this Revlon HD
lip color this is not HD whatsoever
now the shade is not honey I know that I
had said this shade was honey at the
beginning of the week I believe this is
called devotion I can't actually find
the name on the bottle but that is what
it looks like it smells like cake it
feels really good on the lips again it
reminds me a lot of the NARS Velvet lip
glide formula so if you want something
nice and creamy and beautiful like that
you would enjoy these as well and
finally the last item that I have been
loving is again and makeup related it is
from laura geller it is the beach matte
baked hydrating bronzer in the shade is
sunrise fair this is what it looks like
I just love this I really really love it
I have been dabbing this pretty much all
over my face this week which I know
probably sounds a little excessive like
who puts bronzer all over their face but
for some reason this just looks so
incredibly natural when it's on the skin
and it does lean a little more unlike
the organ G side but it just looks so
stunning when you actually get it on the
face you know how sometimes you look at
a product and you're like oh my god
you're gonna be orange but then it goes
onto the skin beautifully that is what
this is so anyway that is it guys those
are my fields and holy grails for the
week definitely let me know down below
what you have been loving this week and
what you haven't been loving and yeah I
will see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
