my channel and welcome back to my files
and a degree also where I share with you
guys the products I have been loving
this week and of course the products I
have not been loving now before I get
into my feels and holy grails
today I did want to make a little bit of
an announcement video for you guys first
of all Merry Christmas Eve if you do
celebrate Christmas but also I wanted to
let you guys know I am taking a break
from my channel it's only gonna be a
week-long break I will be back on it
January 1st but the reason why I'm doing
this is first of all to spend time with
friends and family during the holidays
and second of all because I'm going to
get a jump start on my 2 other channels
now you guys know I never complain about
posting usually 6 to 7 videos a week
it's never something that's super super
difficult for me to do even working
full-time but I have noticed that it's
been hard for me to keep up with the
other two channels now one of them I
haven't even posted on but I have
already started the channel that is a
mystery channel if you guys look for
that channel right now you won't be able
to find it because I have not posted my
first video on there yet but the live
loves for music Channel and that one I
did start but I haven't even posted a
video for about a month on there because
I'm just finding it hard to do 9 videos
a week so if the 6 to 7 videos is
totally fine but the 9 videos kind of
hit my limit you know what I'm saying so
what I wanted to do was go ahead and
spend it that week pre filming for the
other two channels so although I will
not be on the beauty Channel I will be
on my other two channels I am going to
go ahead and leave on the community tap
section in YouTube probably on Wednesday
or Thursday when we get back from our
trip from Sedona I will leave a little
note letting you guys know when I have
started the new a mystery Channel and
you can check that one out
it's live loves and mysteries is it live
loves for mysteries no it's just live
loves mysteries and then live loves for
music like I said you won't be able to
find the mystery channel until I post my
first video on there but I will let you
guys know in the community tab section
when I do it a new video will either be
up on Wednesday Thursday or Friday next
week so anyway guys now that I got that
out of the way let's go ahead and jump
into the fails and holy grails there
were actually no fails for the week it
was only Holy Grail so I want to
with the eyeshadow combo of palettes I
have been using this week I've been
getting a lot of questions about my
eyeshadow I have been combining at the
new Too Faced chocolate gold palette
with and these lorac mega pro 2 palette
I love this palette right here it's
probably my all-time favorite cool-toned
palette if you have never had the
privilege of going ahead and trying out
the lorac Pro formula these are some
really really soft creamy buttery
shadows I would say that the shimmers in
here are identical in formula and
texture and all that kind of stuff as
the mattes which is amazing so I've been
using a lot of shades in here
specifically a melon and tangerine I've
kind of been doing in my upper crease
and then I've been taking ash Cabernet
and goshi like in my crease and I really
really like that look of like the cool
tone eye with a little bit of warmth
above the brow or I mean like right
underneath the brow and then I have been
going ahead and using these as little
shadows right here on my lower lash line
as well as on my lid the shades I've
been using the most are chocolate gold
and sassy and classy so I've really been
enjoying both of those palettes I think
they do a really nice job pairing well
together I feel like the chocolate gold
palette definitely is one of those
supplementary palettes you kind of need
to pull in another palette if you want
to create really really interesting
looks because it only has two or three
matte shades in it but I really been
enjoying the combo of those two up next
I have a cruelty-free and vegan perfume
that was recently sent over from my
friend Tony so thank you so much Tony
and this is the sweet cream and honey
perfume you can get these at Aeropostale
as well as that old navy I love this set
it's really really nice usually I'm not
a fan of super powdery sort of
fragrances but I feel like the honey in
here really makes things nice and sweet
so that has been my go-to perfume this
week another item that I have been
reaching for very very frequently that I
have just fallen back in love with is
the cartas blush palette from Tarte and
this has four different blushes in it
and the two that I have been reaching
for the most this week are definitely
laugh and love which are the two
neutrals in the middle they're beautiful
one of them has a little bit of gold
sheen to it and the other one is just
completely matte and gorgeous on the
skin I love all four shades in here but
these are very long-lasting very very
comparable to the full-size Amazonian
clay 12-hour blushes and they look great
on the skin so I've been loving that
little palette here we have a body wash
that I've been getting a lot of use out
of
 love the scent on this this is
from rituals my friend actually got this
in her boxycharm and she said she did
not like the feeling of it it kind of is
like a shave gel so if light comes on in
a gel but then it turns into a foam but
it's a body wash you could also use it
as a shaving cream but this is from
rituals like I said it's called the
happy Buddha sweet orange and cedar
foaming shower gel sensation I cannot
even tell you how nice the scent is to
me I don't know what it is it kind of
smells like orange a little bit of
ginger and obviously a little bit of
cedar and it just kind of gets me into
the holiday cheer so I've been using
that to shave my legs and I also have
been using it to shave my armpits and I
also have been using it as a body wash
it's like a three-in-one so I've been
enjoying that product a lot I also have
two little lippies here and the buck
simmer recently sent over they sent me a
set of I believe 24 of their different
lip glosses and full-on lip creams you
guys have been recommending to these to
me forever and I've been so happy with
them they are so nice if you are not a
fan of really really tingly kind of lip
glosses these are not gonna be for you I
do notice they're a little sticky I feel
like the lip gloss I'm wearing today
which is the Too Faced sweet peach lip
oil that's a lot more comfortable than
these are but I really love the
pigmentation on these I love the feeling
and I feel like they really really stay
within the lip line which is quite nice
so the two shades I've been wearing the
most this week are this one which is
called Jasmine it's kind of like a deep
purple with a little bit of shimmer in
it and you guys will be able to see I
think that these have some pretty good
pigmentation for a lip gloss and then
the other one that I have been reaching
for is called bramble berry she looks
like bramble berry pie hit me in the
spirit as well this one is beautiful and
this one has a little more of a creamy a
formula to it and it kind of comes out
like a bright fuchsia pink but when you
pair it over more muted lipsticks which
I've been pairing together with like
manic NYX a lip lingeries this week and
things like that it really comes out
nicely and it helps any sort of liquid
lipstick that is a little uncomfortable
if this helps it wear a little longer
and also it helps it from looking a dry
and cracki
so thank you so much buxom for sending
those products over I was happy to
finally try out some of their lip
products cuz I know this is what they
are most known for alright guys I have a
my update for you guys on the uLTA
Beauty HD is soft focus a liquid
foundation I did a first impressions
foundation Friday video on this last
week and I have to say I still run it
I've been using it all week I have been
mixing it a little bit with the Smashbox
Studios skin 15 hour where foundation in
the shade at one point one for just a
little bit of extra moisture but I also
have been wearing this alone it's just
absolutely gorgeous on the skin the
shade that I wear is like cool I do
notice that this doesn't wear an
incredibly long time I feel like in the
first impressions video you guys could
see it that it really did wear a good 5
to 6 hours but then after the 8 hour
mark there were some areas where it
started to break up kind of around my
nose area and stuff like that it is a
silicon based foundation and when you
put it on the skin is this really a
really kind of liquidy sepia formula and
I feel like you could kind of see why
you would have kind of you know fall off
your face throughout the day because it
feels very silicone like but it looks
really beautiful initially on the skin
and I feel like if you do have normal
skin dry skin and combination skin you
would get a kick out of this so yeah i'm
so giving that a solid 3 out of 5 stars
very very happy with the uLTA Beauty HD
soft focus liquid foundation up next we
have a product here that was actually
sent over for PR as well this is from
Oprah and this is the makeup fixer
lightness it says it holds blush
eyeshadow foundations and concealers I
didn't even know that this exists did
you guys and I'm so happy that I do it
now I feel like the mister is a little
hard sometimes I really have to push
down on the nozzle but it smells really
good
and this thing right here which is eight
fluid ounces is only sixteen dollars at
Ulta this is a pretty darn it cheap
makeup fixing a miss if you were looking
for a good one that will prolong the
wear of your makeup a little bit even if
it's just one to two hours I would
highly recommend you guys look into the
Ofra makeup fixer I've been enjoying
that a lot
and then finally guys the last item now
I've been loving this week it's my
sweethearts a bronzer baked luminous
glow bronzer in the shade sweet tea from
Too Faced I just love this it gives me a
glow all over the skin I have to make
sure I go in with a very fluffy brush or
it kind of looks like I have like
bruises on my face so I make sure not to
do stamping motions just really nice and
light dusting motions but I really enjoy
it so anyway guys that is it those are
the products I have been loving this
week like I said I will be active on my
other channels in this coming week a bye
and that's pretty much it I hope you
have a happy holidays no matter what you
celebrate thank you so much for joining
me guys and I will see you in January
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
