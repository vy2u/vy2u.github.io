welcome back to my channel welcome back
to my piles and how to gray house where
I share with you guys see products I
have been loving this week and of course
as always the products I have not been
loving if you hear any scratching on the
door it is the ferrets because they know
I'm about to film a shot my stash after
this and they to get to come out and
play so anyway let's go ahead and jump
into they fails and the favourites for
the week I definitely have two different
fails here I know I haven't been on
camera too often this week but I had
been using all of the products for shop
my stash that we would have had it
better have alone respect okay what I
was saying was I have been using all the
products that we shopped at my stash for
last week I just haven't really been on
camera babies are here like I said they
know that they get to make an appearance
in these videos now are you excited yeah
so anyway let's go ahead and jump right
into it let's start with the fails for
the week alright so the first product
that definitely did not work for me this
week was the vintage by Jessica leap
skin smokey eye pencil in jet black as
well as the Urban Decay optical illusion
complexion a primer it's supposed to be
smoothing it has Rosoff and argan oil in
it import perfecting I can see how it
could be poor perfecting because this is
like the thickest silicone based primer
I've ever put on my face but
unfortunately it made of my skin a pill
or it made whatever product underneath
it pills so I tried using this with
multiple different skin care products
I've tried using it with like a thin a
base of just moisturizer underneath I
cannot get this to work so that is
definitely a fail and then when it comes
to the smoky eye pencil I got this in a
boxy charm and I understand it supposed
to be one of those pencils that you kind
of smoke out on your lower lashline or
maybe you do a wing and then you smoke
it out I can't do wing so I
couldn't do that but I did wear it on at
my waterline I do have it on my
waterline right now and it just doesn't
have a long way or time so I understand
it is a smokey eye pencil but if you're
hoping you can wear this on your
waterline I think again bitch because it
will not work
alright now let's go ahead and talk
about some products that really were a
great this week in my opinion the first
one is definitely the dose of color ice
cream palette I am so incredibly happy
with this palette and impressed with
this palette you guys if you're
wondering what shades I have on my eyes
today I have blueberry swirl as well as
cone and double scoop and then a little
bit of bubblegum which is that pink
shade and that one is all over my lid
and this is just a gorgeous palette I
love all the looks that I can get with
I feel like the lavender honey at the
banana splint and banana splint but Nana
split as well midship shades are really
really special if you want something a
little more colorful but then you can go
very neutral and just do like sherbert
and Conan or you can do a really really
deep smoky I have been incredibly happy
with this palette if you can get your
hands on this I would highly recommend
you do so and then another palette that
I have been loving this week is the
urban decay backtalk palette so let me
just take the mirror out here because
it's super annoying but as you guys can
see you have three different blushes or
two different highlights two blushes
depending on your skin tone as well as a
bunch of different eyeshadows here and I
know so many people have been asking for
my thoughts on this I think it's a
little overpriced I also feel like a lot
of these eyeshadows are very very warm
toned would you look at the pictures
remember that video I did all about
makeup the mindfuck to me I feel like
all of the photos that release for this
particular palette looked very very cool
toned and I'm the lover of cool toned
eyeshadows as you guys can probably tell
today with the ice cream palette on my
eyes so I was a little um I'm not gonna
say upset but I was a little taken aback
when I realized how warm these actually
pull on the eyes however I think the
shadows are really good I'm usually not
the biggest fan of Urban Decay
eyeshadows i'm i never liked the naked
palettes or anything like that i don't
like when they do a ton of glitter in
few shades they really only have one in
here which is called curve but shade
attitude what the in 1980 I'm sorry
180 are really really a fabulous in my
opinion I like that you kind of have to
build them up a little bit because these
are colors that you do need to be a
little careful with I really go ham with
these I feel like I don't get that
really really pretty smooth looking
finish I get that very like okay I might
have a head cold or I might be sick sort
of look so I actually do like that you
can build these up there are a few
shades that are a little bit of a mess I
don't love curve and I don't love bear
however I do find that if I take bear
and I pack it on with a damp eyes shadow
brush I really can get it nicely onto my
lid now I feel like the standouts in
this palette are actually the two
blushes and the two highlighters party
foul is this really interesting kind of
dusty rosy champagne colored highlight
that actually looks very very flattering
on fair skin in my opinion and the shade
underneath it which I have right here
which is called low-key reminds me a lot
of like Narses orgasm it's a very peachy
it's very warm and it has that gold
Sheen running through it he's have a
more smooth Dometic own feel to them and
because of that I really feel like I can
buff them on and they look great on my
cheekbones and then when it comes to the
two blushes a double take is definitely
a dupe of for the what is it cap on D at
Lolita eyeshadow and a blush it's single
so if you never got your hands on that
this is so similar and then you
also have this one right here which is
called cheap shot which is a beautiful
beautiful mob with a silver sheen to it
you guys these blushes are impeccable in
my opinion I love the way they go on
they built up really really nicely on
the skin and as you guys can see with
those one swipe swatches they go on
beautifully though when it comes to the
backtalk palette from Urban Decay you
guys expect to be pretty darn impressed
with these face products in here and if
you are a lover of more warm toned berry
shades I know that sounds very very
strange like a lot of people were
arguing is this a warm tone palette a
neutral palette or a cool tone palette I
would say it's more neutral warm but if
you're a lover of those deeper reddish
kind of berry colors that lean a little
more on the warm tone side I think
you're gonna like the eye looks that you
come out with these however they do take
a little bit of building they're not
necessarily the easiest eyeshadow to
blend you have to spend a little more
time on them but overall I think this is
going to be a great palette for travel
and I have been actually really really
happy with it and I will be going ahead
and pulling that for shot my stash this
week so we'll talk about that in a
little bit moving on guys I have another
product here that I have been loving it
is the elf golden bronzer oh my god why
haven't I been reaching for this this is
just absolutely gorgeous I love that it
has these cool tone squares in here and
then you have one little warm tone
Square and then you have a highlighting
square dings I like the amount of Sheen
in here it's not Sparkle it's not
glitter this is what like a six dollar
bronzer and honestly I'm really really
happy that I pulled it for the week so
I've been incredibly happy with my
golden bronzer from elf cosmetics I have
a couple of products here from Urban
Decay again I know that I pulled a lot
of urban decay products but these are
the advice liquid lipsticks and I've
been pretty happy with these um the two
shades that I have been wearing the most
this week have definitely been trivial
which is on my lips right now as well as
this one which is backtalk so kind of
funny that that goes along with the back
top palette I know a lot of people were
saying they do not like these liquid
lipsticks however I don't
any issues with them I can see a lot of
you are not really into first of all to
shade selection a lot of people were
saying the shades are very similar to
one another which they absolutely are
but second of all people were saying
these are way too drying and they start
to kind of show the lip line throughout
the day I don't think these are super
uncomfortable in fact I think these are
pretty damn comfortable for a liquid
lipstick and I'm rather happy with them
I wouldn't say they're my all-time
favorite and they're not like the best
product that I use this week but they
definitely aren't bad and I for sure I'm
not going to be decluttering them now to
be fair these are all colors that are
very similar to my natural lip color
sort of like a your lips but better so
it's very possible that if I were to get
a darker shade or a bright red or
something that would really really show
fading throughout the day maybe I
wouldn't like these as much you can't
really touch them up throughout the day
but I never get that link dried butthole
cracked feeling on my lips throughout
the day so I've been pretty happy with
these if you're not too maybe try
topping them with a lip or even a lip
gloss and seeing if you like him like
that but yeah that is amulets trivial as
well as backed up from Urban Decay and
these are their vice a liquid lipstick
this past week I did try out a mascara
combo that I have never done before this
is the Marc Jacobs velvet noir mascara
combined with the hello lashes from it
cosmetics I love it I absolutely love it
I have it on today this is a natural
bristle wand this is a rubber bristle
wand with a rubber bristle one I go in
with one coat of the Marc Jacobs before
it dries I go directly in with the
rubber bristle bot from this guy and
this is a really really precise
beautiful mascara if you want very very
natural and but to find lashes like very
work-friendly lashes I would like to say
this is a great mascara to have in your
collection but paired together with this
one you're going to get that variable
luminous a look you're gonna get a lot
of length a lot of definition but it's
not gonna be overly clumpy and I'm
actually really fan of the two of these
together so I really have been loving
that pairing I also have been loving my
Smashbox camera ready BB water drops the
only thing that I wasn't too happy about
this week is I am breaking out like
 crazy
break that's all over my chin as well as
all like right here kind of in that area
where I get those hormonal painful
breakouts camera ready BB water drops is
shared
like coverage at most so this definitely
didn't cover exactly what I wanted it to
cover but I went in with a thicker
concealer to really cover up those that
breakouts throughout the week I'm
thinking of going for something a little
more hydrating as well with a little
more coverage for shot my stash today so
we will choose something out but I
absolutely love this it is gorgeous if
you do have dry skin and you only want
like a light tint of a foundation on
it's what I have on today and it just
looks stunning on the skin it really
makes your skin look like skin and
finally some more products that have
been very good to me this week the ciate
hello to illuminating blushes so happy
that I pulled these four shot my stash
as well as mary lou manizer from the
balm cosmetics oh my god you know this
is one of those highlighters where you
look at it and you think it's a basic
bitch because you're just like oh my god
it's just like every other champagne
colored highlight out there but it
really is special I mean I'm looking at
myself right now and I just love that
you know I took the highlight kind of
down to the apples of my cheeks and it's
just like a beam of light like
I'm a little angel it just popped out of
a cloud from heaven or some
I mean it is absolutely beautiful it's
got this gold undertone but it's now
almost kind of neutral it's like a
neutral champagne it looks good on so
many different skin tones and absolutely
it's something I would recommend you
guys check out so I've been very happy
with Mary Lou this week as well if they
glow to you illuminating blushes like I
said at this one right here is baby doll
I even wore the shade all over my lid
the other day at work because they are
eye safe and then right here we have
date night which is what I have on my
cheeks today I love that these have
those built in kind of glowy highlighter
colors so date night definitely has more
mob and kind of very brown mahogany
undertones and then it has this
beautiful gold sheen running through it
paired together with mary lou it really
has just made my cheeks look nice and
plump and full and beautiful so anyway
guys that is it two for fales and holy
grails let's go ahead and jump into shop
my stash hey guys you gonna stop my
stairs with me yeah let's do it okay so
let me show you guys a few products that
I have already pulled earlier this week
the first one is from dose of colors
this was the lipstick that I didn't end
up reaching for this week I did pull
this last week for shop my stash it is
the dose of colors satin lipstick in the
shade parfait I definitely want to give
this a chance since I didn't have time
to play with it I also went ahead and
pulled the it cosmetics brow power which
is supposed to be a universal
pencil as well as the Urban Decay 24/7
glide-on eye pencil in the shade
perversion which is a matte black I want
to wear that on my waterline I was using
a not-so-great eyeliner pencil this week
on my waterline so now want a good one
and then over here I definitely want to
play or continue playing with my Urban
Decay backtalk palette I also thought
that these little guys right here might
look pretty paired together with this
palette ooh these are the wet and wild
liquid cat suit eyes shadows in the
shades let's see here this one is called
it's focusing on the lipstick and this
one is called a pure intention and then
this little pink one right here which I
also think would be pretty all over the
lid is called a mystic dreamer so I
think those are gonna be really really
nice together but yeah those are the
products so far that I have pulled
sometimes I plan ahead and I kind of
know what I want to do for the following
weeks is shot my stash so that is why
I've already pulled at these items now
let's go ahead and jump into the drawers
and see what we should do for primer and
foundation I know for sure that I want a
foundation that has a little more
coverage this week I have been breaking
out like crazy so I'm very tempted to
reach for my Smashbox Studios scan a
15-hour we're hydrating foundation in
the shade 1.1 but now that I'm looking
at my drawer this guy right here is
rather new to me it's the Physicians
Formula cushion foundation I've only had
this for about two months and I really
don't get a lot of use out of it so I
think I should reach for this guy the
shade is light and has SPF 50
broad-spectrum sunscreen so I'm gonna
wear that for foundation and then as far
as primer is concerned definitely gonna
go in with my Becca under eye primer
which I have been using with pretty much
every you know look that I've been
wearing like the past month I just
really really enjoy this and then I
think for eye primer let's see I used
this one last week so I think I'll go
with just the regular Urban Decay
eyeshadow primer potion this week and
then when it comes to face primer mmm
you know what maybe I should reach for
this this is the Bobbi Brown vitamin
enriched face base can you guys see this
I've made a lot of progress on this and
I need to finish it off so let's see if
I can finish that off this if I'm going
with that Christian foundation I think
it would be nice to have a little bit of
a thicker concealer this week I'm
thinking of mixing together my Kat Von D
lock a concealer creme in the shade
whiteout with the
bye-bye redness from it cosmetics this
is just a universally flattering sort of
redness relief cream and it's really not
universally flattering they just pretend
it is there they say it is it is way too
dark for me even when I am self tan
that's why I will mix it together with
this guy so these will be for my under
eyes you set my face I'm thinking I
should finish off my Catrice cosmetics
prime and find mattifying powder I have
only a little bit of this left as you
guys can see I'm currently panning this
so I will use that to set my face I also
will pull the Becca under-eye
brightening setting powder since I'm
trying to use that up for my under eye
and then also hmmm should I pull I guess
I'll pull my Kat Von D locket setting
powder
I really have realized that I prefer my
Too Faced ethereal setting powder over
the sky I was going to repurchase this
but I really do prefer this one so we
will go ahead and use this once I run
out of the Catrice cosmetics this week
alright let's see if there's anything in
the top drawer that I need to reach for
this week this is kind of the drawer
where I have PR as well as products I
haven't tried yet I guess I will pull
these crown brushes this is the 3-piece
Pro brush trio so they kind of look like
the wet and wild brushes I will pull
that and try that this week as far as
highlight is concerned I do have my eye
on a particular product I know I have
these new face candy palettes right here
however I really really want to try out
this J cat beauty highlight because I've
heard such good things about these this
is the you glow girl baked highlighter
in the shade Bella Rose so I think that
would look really really pretty paired
together with the urban decay back to
obviously we have a blush in the urban
decay back top palette so I am going to
skip this drawer this week however when
I open up at the eye shadow drawer I was
thinking since I did get that big PR
package from the hush app I have all of
these bad habit palettes I want to try
out in review for you guys I have a
feeling the Athena palette would pair
really nicely with the back top pallet
kind of as like toppers for my lid guys
yes they are all up in my now but I
thought maybe the Urban Decay palette
would pair nicely with the Athena Athena
for lid colors especially this one like
epic and triumph and cunning and divine
and gleam do you think that would be
nice with the
decay backtalk I think so so let's add
that into the Mex we already have the
liquid eyeshadows from wet-and-wild this
week so not gonna pull any of the Stila
is not gonna pull any of my Becca
cosmetics highlighters let's go ahead
and do with some let's see here mascara
though you know would be nice I think
the Charlotte Tilbury full-fat lashes
mascara would be really nice paired
together where is it where is it where
is it there it is with the MADD lash
mascara I feel like this would be a
really really nice of do the full fat
lashes from Charlotte Tilbury gives very
feathery looking lashes and then this
one defines very nicely so this is a
natural bristle one and then the matte
lash is rubber bristles so let's do that
for left I think that'll do it you guys
take this do not come walking over by my
palette when it's open like this
khaleesi Khaleesi I don't trust her I do
not trust her we're closing that up I
know I know you love to be in mommy's
makeup I know a bunch of you were asking
if I would do a ferrets choose my makeup
video I absolutely will because she
steals my all the time do you want
that yeah so anyway guys that is all
that is everything that I will be using
on my famous week we might have some
glitter on the lids which I think these
are gonna be gorgeous we have a nice
base product here so we're gonna try out
that foundation again from Physicians
Formula we're gonna have really nice
concealed under eyes especially with
this concealing creme this is a great
one and then we will set that in with
the Becca powder we have an extra
highlighter here in case the
highlighters in the backtalk palette are
just not enough for me this week we've
got a nice a mascara pairing as well as
a beautiful lip color so that is pretty
much it thanks for joining me guys and I
will see you tomorrow for miscellaneous
Monday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
