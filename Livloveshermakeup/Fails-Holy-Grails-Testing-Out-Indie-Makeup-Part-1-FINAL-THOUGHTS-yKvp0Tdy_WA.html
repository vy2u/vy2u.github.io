channel welcome back to my friends and
had a rails where I share with you guys
the products I have been loving this
week and of course the products I have
not been loving Before we jump right
into it it's a cold store ok I knew that
if I do to wear lipstick today people
would ask me what's going on with my lip
I have been sick this past week and
every single time I get sick with a
little bit player with a head cold with
anything I do get cold sores it's just
my immune system is very low and I'm
just very prone to getting them when I'm
not feeling good so anyway like I said
today we have my fails in holy grails I
want to share with you guys my favorites
and it fails from the past two weeks
because for this past week I didn't wear
too much makeup since I wasn't feeling
good about last week I did not feel our
sales in holy grails and I thought it
would also be fun to kind of give you
guys my insight on it some products that
have we tested out that I liked and that
I didn't like and I also want to give
you guys my final thoughts on the
products from touch of glamour beauty I
did a video called testing out indie
makeup where I tried out some indie
makeup from an Etsy shop of my friend
Amy sent over some products that I
wanted to give you guys are my thoughts
on it the ones that I really enjoyed and
the ones I did not like so let's go
ahead and jump right into it we are
going to start with the veils the first
one is from Tarte this is a skin care
product from the rainforest of the sea
line and this is called the marina
boosting a myth now this is something
that I used to like that when I was in
Milwaukee I actually loved the deep dive
cleansing gel I really do enjoy the h2o
hydrating boost and moisturizer but
unfortunately I have been noticing that
this dizzying rash on my face after
using it now that citrus in here it does
have some lavender oil and I don't know
what it is is irritating my skin those
ingredients are in every single product
from the rainforest of the seed line as
far as the skin care products are
concerned so I don't know if it's those
ingredients but there's something in
here that when I spray it on my face it
starts to get very itchy and red so I'm
going to stop using this for now the
next two products I have here that are
failed are definitely these guys these
are both of body washes I have
discovered that I am very very picky
when it comes to body washes I really
like something that's super creamy and
gets a nice lather on my skin this guy
right here is the Sol de Janeiro
Brazilian foreplay moisturizing shower
cream gel this was sent to me for PR and
although I love the sentiment it smells
exactly like the Brazilian boom boom
creams I take the consistency of it
honestly feels like a shampoo and I
don't feel like it gets me very clean so
that is something that I have been
incredibly disappointed with and then
this guy
right here which is from wash is called
the comforter shower creams and says
wash away your worries with this
reassuring blackcurrant substr it's a
cuddle in a bottle I love the scent it
kind of smells like blackberries and
raspberries and cream but unfortunately
this is incredibly slimy so this one
feels like a shampoo this one feels very
slimy I think I'm just doing very
difficult I clean I don't feel like they
make me feel clean even when I use a
loofah I just don't feel super clean and
I feel like that's the point of having a
body wash so both those guys right they
are a feel for me and then finally I
have my two fails from the touch of
glamour beauty line and these are two
different highlighters the first one is
called color this is the color meets
sparkle highlighter initiate
kiss-and-tell
and the reason why I don't like this you
guys is just because honestly it's
really a really a glittery I am NOT a
glittery highlight kind of girl it's not
my thing if you love a blinding glittery
highlight you may enjoy this great can
see it's incredibly pigmented these are
handmade cosmetics so it's very cool but
it's just not for me
and then this guy right here is pie in
the sky which is kind of like a little
pizza pie this is not my color it's not
really my formula I'm just not into this
I find it very very chunky and powdery
on the skin she has a lot of
highlighters in my opinion that are
better than this which I will show you
guys in a second although it's very
pigmented and again this would be
beautiful if you do have like a deeper
skin tone is just not for me and I do
have a hard time applying those to
highlighters alright now let's go ahead
and get you to the Holy Grail so first
few are from wet and while this is from
the new midnight mermaid collection
these by the wet and wild color icon
metallic liquid eyes shadows in these
shades aquatic prism as well as
moonlight and majesty is that right yeah
moonlight Majesties so mold like majesty
reminds me lots of violet is vixx Anna
from Eddie Fiola glitter and glow
collection and then this guy right here
is super super beautiful I was wearing
it yesterday I know a lot of people were
into my eye look yesterday I kind of
just flopped this on and they kind of
blunder there really quickly but I
really like these you guys I feel like
they're very very pigmented I will be
doing a full collection review on the
midnight Merman mermaid collection so if
you guys want to see that this week
definitely let me know down below but
here is the shade moonlight and majesty
guys can see they're just super super
beautiful I feel like they're even a
little more pigmented than the Stila
glitter in glows but they don't have
like the chunks and flex with leather so
you're not going to get that blinding
blinding look like
I am wearing one of the Stila glittering
loads right now in the shade Sunset Cove
you can see it immediately and this guy
right here is going to be more of like
an iridescent sort of glow on the eyes
instead of like a sparkly glow but
honestly they're really beautiful
they're very long-lasting and I like
that you can blend them and then here is
the shade let's see here what's 102
sorry this one is called moonlight
Majesties that's the purple one and
again this one's very similar to the
glitter and glow in the shade of violet
vixen that one doesn't have as much
sparkle in it and I feel like this one's
very similar but I really like these I
feel like you can take this tiny little
one you can smoke it out on the lower
lash line kind of blend it out quickly
they don't get too sticky they don't get
too tacky you have some time to work
with them so I really been enjoying
those I also have been loving the Burt's
Bees a BB cream it with noni extract
this particular shade isn't light and I
am wearing this today I also really like
taking a nice blob of this putting it
all over my face it is very very color
correcting I have a great cast - it kind
of reminds me a lot of the doctor jar -
BB cream so if you have tried those
before whether it's like the silver one
or the gold tube or even just a black
tube this one is very very similar is a
kolbe free option and I really enjoy it
don't have broad-spectrum SPF 15 and in
it in here and these are physical Sun
blocks which I do prefer on my sensitive
skin so really have been enjoyed that
and then here are the highlighters from
touch of glam Beauty that I would
definitely recommend to you guys so
although I wasn't a big fan of these
guys right here the color may Sparkle
and the pie-in-the-sky as these four are
the ones I would highly recommend so the
first one is called Purple Haze this is
what I have on my cheeks today I love
this highlighter you guys do you see
this is like the epitome of a perfect
kind of muted a purple highlight I have
it on today and I used a light hand it's
got a gorgeous amount of shine to it
it's not glittery it's not sparkly so
you guys can see here these are a little
more on the chunky side this one is very
smooth and it has that high shine impact
kind of stuff like that beige it all day
formula which you guys know I love and I
love a true kind of purple highlight
that isn't super crazy and in-your-face
but like it's noticeable like you can
tell like I have on a different kind of
color to highlight this is a really
great one and then I also have been
enjoying this guy right here this is
from the Kaleidoscope a collection this
particular shade is called sunburst now
when I did my first impressions I wasn't
huge and very keen on it but I really do
like it it kind of
a mixture of yellow and a little bit of
pink in there and I do feel like this is
a little more on this year side you guys
can see when I swatch it next to the
Purple Haze it just has a little more of
like a I don't know like a little more
of a transparent vibe going on but it
reminds me a lot of the what is it I
think it's called the Portofino
highlighter from mmm who is it from
I guarantee on but there is a Portofino
highlighter that reminds me a lot of
this like updates kind of highlight so I
really like the two of those and then I
also have been loving these 50 shades of
pink again really really nice kind of
cool tone pink shade it definitely has
that really smooth texture to it and it
does smell like candy you guys this one
is actually sentient the other ones are
not but this one smells great so here is
the shade 50 shades of pink super super
beautiful and then the last one that I
have here is called illusion and this is
more of like a duo chrome it's got a
little bit of like a greenish to it
and I really really like this one as
well so these are definitely before
highlighters I would recommend from
touch of glam Beauty there they are
super super beautiful these are just the
ones that go on with any sort of brush
if you want like more of a light kind of
look you can just apply it with like a
lucky 522 tapered highlighter if you
want something more Rambam in your face
you can go in with like a sigma f-35
brush they go on beautiful we really
like the formula on those but would
highly recommend all right the next
product we have here is from hemp this
is the yuzu and star through touch of
summer for bare skin tones SPF 30
feeling moisturizing gradual
self-tanning crap I've been obsessed
with it I picked this up when I did on
my pamper haul I bought this at Ulta I
really like this you guys this is a
vegan cruelty free self-tanner I feel
like those are kind of hard to find
maybe not actually is like a lot of self
tanners are cruelty free but maybe not
vegan this is all being in ingredients
actually smells really really good
my only complaint is that it goes on
smelling really sweet kind of like a
little bit of starfish which is my
favorite fruit by the way it goes on
smelling very sweet so then after a
while you do get that kind of like
burning skin so now I don't know how
else to describe it you know that
horrible self-tanner smell that you get
after the self-tanner has kind of like
gone into your skin you do get that
sense with this but when you wash your
body off like the next day and it goes
away so it's certainly something that I
have been enjoying probably doesn't
begin a self-tanner that I have ever
found and I'm very happy with it
that have SPF 30 in it I think that's
really cool and I would think the color
starts to build within an hour so that's
hot sounds and then next slide you have
a little tart blush here you guys might
have been pretty obsessed with tart
lately and this is one of their
Amazonian clay blushes initiated party
it should not be called partay okay this
should be called like Primrose or
 rose or Primrose okay
this is a beautiful beautiful color now
I do feel like a lot of tarts blushes
tend to look the same I have so many
George blushes so many so many I have
the big Bush book to you I have like a
bajillion of their Amazonian clay blush
palette I have a bunch of their singles
but I have to say this is one of the
most unique and beautiful colors they
have ever come out with it is like a
kinky mob color and honestly if they
have this in a full-size I am purchasing
it you see that it's just such a
beautiful barely there sort of blush
look and that is what I have been
pairing together this past week with the
birth of BB cream or these baby cream I
just like throwing this on really quick
when I'm sick kind of doing a little
color correcting topping on a little bit
of a powder to the streets a little bit
of a sticky consistency and then putting
some of this blush on and I love it so I
am super into that this was like from a
250 points or from Sephora if they still
have it pick it up it's amazing and
finally guys I'm going to give you guys
my final thoughts on these little babies
right here which are the eight eyes
shadows from touch of glam a beauty so
she gets sent to me four different
duochrome as well as four different soil
eyeshadows when I did the first
impressions I definitely would
preferring to these oil eyeshadows and I
still do the duo Chrome's are really
beautiful I get a lot of compliments
every time I wear a lovechild these are
really really nice for wearing it very
very quickly kind of like a one and done
I look so you guys can see these are
very pigmented they're very very pretty
but I do find these a little more
difficult to work with they are a little
more chunky and glittery which you guys
know I'm not super super into but the
soil shades you guys are amazing this
one right here which is called
firecracker is my all-time favorite if
you see this pigment on here I mean it's
just amazing just amazing what she has
done with this formula so I really
really feel like these oil shades on
that stuff that swatch I really do love
the foil shades the duo Chrome's are
pretty good not anything that I'm
complaining about I would definitely
reach for the foils more and those just
once I would recommend you guys but yeah
and that is pretty much it those are my
fails and holy grails as well as my
final thoughts on those products that I
tested out our indie makeup is concerned
I hope you guys enjoyed this video as
always
you so much for joining me and I will
see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
