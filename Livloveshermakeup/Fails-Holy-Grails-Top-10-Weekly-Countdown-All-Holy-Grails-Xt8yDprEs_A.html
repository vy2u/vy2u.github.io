welcome back to my channel welcome back
to my files and holograms where I share
with you guys the products I have been
loving this week and of course the
products I have not been loving so funny
story if you have been watching me for a
while you know that I do one take of
videos I rarely start a video over I
mean it's like the alarm starts going
off in the building or if there's like a
freaking plane zooming by and it's super
loud I will go ahead and start a video
over but for the most part I do one take
videos now sometimes the one take videos
don't turn out the way I want them to
but I feel like it's a very real and raw
way to upload to YouTube and I like that
you guys get to see a multi-faceted side
of me so you get to see me when I'm
feeling really good sometimes me when
I'm not feeling so good you get to see
all the different sides of me and
yesterday was it yesterday no it was the
day before
ok whatever a day or two ago I filmed my
fails in holy grails with mr. badger i
if you didn't know I have a pet ferret
named mr. badger and so many of you
requests that he'd be in more videos now
one thing about ferrets is that when
they first wake up they sleep like 20
hours a day but when they first wake up
they are super freakin hyper and I was
like alright badger like everybody wants
you to be in the video let's film with
you um the video turned out crazy it was
absolutely insane and I was debating
like should I be film that and then I
decided no fuck it I'm not gonna refilm
it let's just put it up we'll see what
happens and uh yeah went over to check
the footage today it was corrupted
I'm gonna tell you how many times I have
some sort of like corrupted file or some
sort of issue I don't even think this
one was corrupted what happened was it
wasn't like playing back on YouTube so I
actually uploaded the footage and then
it said playback error whatever the fuck
that means so it was kind of funny how
that worked out because I was feeling a
little self-conscious about uploading
that one just because um you guys know I
do have severe ADHD and sometimes I feel
very outside of my skin you know what I
mean and on it this particular day when
I had filmed that video I was all over
the place and I was thinking oh I should
probably refill ba ba ba ba ba but the
thing is is that I like you guys to see
all the sides of me you know what I mean
so I I thought you know fuck it I'm
gonna upload it and then
happen the actual playback so it was
just kind of funny I was like alright
this means I need to refill but yeah a
long intro cure two minutes long but
anyway we're going to talk about my
fails holy grails for the week we
actually only have holy grails this week
which is awesome
I didn't really try out any products
that I didn't like so yeah let's go
ahead and do a little top ten countdown
we are going to start with a palette
that has been making me so happy
literally like the past three weeks this
is the Becca Chrissy Teigan at palette I
love I love this so much I feel like I'm
having the same sort of like attachment
and relationship with it
that I did with the Becca champagne
collection one so basically this is what
the outer packaging looks like I have
this on my eyes today let me know if you
guys want me to do and I look aware I
put this together and I also use it on
my face so I could you like a get ready
with me using this basically on my whole
entire face I put the shade sometimes on
my lips like you can put together your
whole entire look with this palette
today I do have this shade right here
which is called beech nectar all over my
lid I have this guy right here which is
called Malibu Soleil I have that in my
crease I have this in my outer-v I have
this on as my blush I have this on in my
crease as well I mean I just have this
all over my face today and I love it I
absolutely love it now any sort of
golden glow that you're seeing is
actually from the new Becca Lite chaser
highlights in the shade of pearl flashes
gold and I will be going ahead and
reviewing at those tomorrow for you but
yeah this palette is amazing I've been
absolutely loving it if you have a fair
complexion don't be scared of this
seriously don't be scared with this
palette is absolutely phenomenal really
been enjoying that alright next I do
have a mascara pair in here so this is
the Maybelline lash discovery mini brush
mascara paired together with the Urban
Decay perversion so today I just have
perversion on umm they paired together
really nicely because when I wear this
on its own it gets a little too gloopy
and honestly I think my eyelids are just
a little too oily this time of year to
be able to pull this off on its own the
lash discovery has a tiny little mini
wand you can also find something like
this from a cosmetics as well as neck so
if you are cruelty free that is a great
option and that's what I'm going to be
going for next but it's a super DT
little wand so basically you can go in
and you can it base just like you know
fill on your eyelashes fill on your
eyelashes you
by a mascara on really really quickly
without thinking about it and you don't
poke yourself in the eye because the
one's so small and then here we have the
Urban Decay perversion really gloopy
thick kind of formula very very much a
wet mascara so if you have super super
oily eyelids you have to be careful I
have also been using the YSL de shock
mascara which is very similar
formulation wise to this one so if you
really like the YSL the shock but you
want any cruelty free option I feel like
this is very very similar they do have a
little bit of different ones but this
one is fantastic so anyway been loving
the two of those pair together I also
have been loving my origins ginseng
energy boosting moisturizer now
unfortunately oranges does test on
animals which is so weird they just
don't seem like a brand that would I
know they say that every single time I
talk about origins but seriously like
origins really like they just don't seem
like they would but they do so anyway
this is the energy boosting moisturizer
I have been loving it and enjoying it
while I have it I will finish it off
obviously would not purchase a full-size
let me know if you have any dupes for
this down below in the comments section
it's a very very lightweight heavy gel
creme sort of consistency great for
those of you with like combo to oily
skin really have been enjoying this and
I kind of like it even more because it
does have a little bit of Dometic own or
silicone in there so it allows you to
kind of put it on and use it as a face
primer in the morning which is awesome
alright next we do have the rainforest
of the sea of volume 3 eyeshadow palette
from Tarte cosmetics I've been loving
this as highlight this week now I do
still use it on my lid I'll go in with
my lower lash line and use some of the
colors in here as well but I mostly love
it for highlighting my favorite shades
in here are definitely heat wave escape
and this one right here which is called
compass which is like a stop gold not
that one this one but yeah this is a
beautiful palette you guys I mean I know
a lot of people have been saying like I
don't like this one as much as the first
or second volumes I agree completely I
did a comparison video on all three of
them which although I hadn't throw up in
the cards if you would like to check it
out but yeah they are really beautiful
on the skin as actual facial highlighter
they're a little more tricky to work
into the crease work into the outer V
work onto the eye in general but this is
a really really wonderful palette for
highlighting so if you can find a small
enough brush to kind of dip in there I
think you would enjoy it I know I have
been loving it this week alright next we
do have a little facial oil this is what
I've actually been putting into my
foundations I've been wearing more full
coverage foundations this week now today
I do
on the Maybelline Dream a cushion which
is a little more of like a light natural
sort of finish what is happening with my
hair it's a little more like a light or
natural finish the what I've been doing
is basically just dropping in two or
three drops that this into the
foundations that I've been mixing which
are the number one spot so I'll go ahead
and show you guys those in a second but
this smells like a Veda haircare product
so reminds me of like the rosemary mint
or like Melba shampoo my mom used to use
the Melba shampoo she has black hair so
it gotta reminds me of that I just feel
like it's a really really beautiful oil
unfortunately Bobby Brown does test on
animals so I wouldn't repurchase but I
really adore this I feel like it's kind
of a clarifying oil as well so if you
are a little more common to oily skin
don't be afraid of using this one to to
your door today one to two drops will
really help to make sure that your
foundation it looks a little more
natural on the skin and not so cakey and
I just I really enjoy it and you know
what sometimes oil does combat oil it
doesn't work for everybody but sometimes
if I am super super oily I will combat
the oil with oil and it seems to work
for me so anybody really have been
enjoying that I also have been loving up
my Too Faced love flush long-lasting 16
hour blush in the shade how deep is your
love a lot of people I have been hating
my blush this week but you know what you
guys and do what you want with your
makeup don't let anybody tell you how to
apply your blush or how to do your
makeup just do you and you know what
I've been putting a lot of this on I've
been putting it on my chin I've been
putting on my forehead I've put some on
my eyelid I don't know what it is it's
just when I see this color it reminds me
of like a beautiful flush of color like
if you were outside running in the heat
or something so yeah I've kind of been
taking my whole face in this I've been
loving it I'm sorry if you didn't love
it but I really been enjoying it this is
a beautiful blush it does last
absolutely all day long and I feel like
this color is really really perfect for
the summer times so let me go ahead and
swatch it for you guys really pretty
isn't it it's just a nice hot coral
flush of color I hope that when I
repurchase this which I'm sure I will in
the future hopefully it's the same
formula it is two-faced but we'll see
yeah I really have been enjoying that
next I do have a product that was sent
to me for PR this is the nerdist skin
care clarifying cleanser for all skin
types this is kind of like an acne based
cleanser so they have like a three-step
system I'm not quite sure about the
nourishing cream that they sent me and I
haven't tried it the sulfur 2% um like
overnight treatment that they gave me
but I tried this one
like it I've been using my drunk
elephant cantaloupe jelly cleanser in
the morning I really gotten into more
like luxurious lathering kind of soft
products on the skin as far as cleansing
is concerned and very much worried that
when I moved to Arizona my skin is just
gonna dry out like crazy so I'm trying
to kind of stay away from like these
salicylic acid benzoyl peroxide kind of
cleansers but this actually has a milky
lather to it and normally when you find
like an acne fighting cleanser like that
it's just not this sort of formula I
don't feel like it strips my skin
whatsoever and I've really been enjoying
it and I really love this packaging so
this is what I've been using at
nighttime and then in the morning like I
said I've been using the cantaloupe
jelly cleanser next I do have a
concealer here that I feel like is very
very similar to the torch shaped a but
this is the Maybelline master conceal by
face studio in the shade at number fair
or the shade ten fair I do have to say
smallest amount of left I will be
updating you guys on my project pan very
soon you guys know I do like to make
sure I'm making the browns for my
collection and I would say having one or
two uses left of this it's got great
great coverage but it still maintains
this nice moistness underneath the eyes
so if you do have more mature skin dry
skin I feel like any sort of skin type
you're really gonna like this and I feel
like the actual coverage that you get is
very reminiscent of the shape tape let
me know if you agree with me on that I
will say the Tarte shaped a definitely
has a better color selection in my
opinion they don't even have that great
of a color selection but the maybelline
one is super super small as well this
definitely leaves a little more on the
yellow tone side which I feel like all
Maybelline face products kind of do but
I've been enjoying that a lot really
really bummed to see that I'm almost
done with this and I won't repurchase
because obviously Maybelline tests on
animals but yeah this is a wonderful
concealer it's a kick-ass drugstore
concealer what can I say alright next we
do have a lip balm that was sent to me
for PR and this is something that I
would repurchase with my own money but
I'm not going to say that you guys need
it so this is a very very personal thing
this is the by Terry Baume De Rose this
is what it looks like it's a glass
frosted container so this was sent to me
from octa Lee in exchange for an honest
review and yeah it smells like rose it
reminds me exactly of the Dior creme de
Rose lip balm except this is $60
the Dior creme de Rosas what like 30 or
40 obviously do your test on animals so
if you want a cruelty-free option the
bite area is a good one but I'm not
gonna say you guys and meet this I'm not
gonna say you should go out and purchase
it because that is a whole lot of
fucking money and for a lip-balm okay
I'm not stupid I'm aware of that now I
am a little different with my lips you
guys know like I've stopped wearing
liquid lipsticks recently because I just
hate the drying sensation I am a flutist
I'm obsessed with my lips like my whole
life kind of revolves around my lips so
this is actually something I would
repurchase for myself but I do want to
say I feel like you can get something a
lot cheaper so I'm not saying you guys
should go out and purchase it but for me
I personally would so if you have the
money to shell out and you do want to
get it I mean it is it is in the Gluck
Sharia 16 more creamy and thick and just
like gorgeous then is a Dior creme de
rose and I have three of the Dior creme
de Rose lip balm I mean those I have
been using a for years now obviously
would not repurchase since they test on
animals but this is a beautiful
beautiful treatment so if you do have
the money and you do want to go for it I
mean I would say yes
I use this nd bite of beauty agave lip
mall a gobby lip balm yeah gady lip balm
before going on stage and I feel like my
lips are so hydrated and plump and they
smell damn good like rose so anyway
really love that and then finally my
all-time favorite product for the week
is definitely these guys mixed together
so like I said I have been using that
Bobbie Brown extra face oil I will drop
a one or two drops into the mixture of
these two so we have the Clinique beyond
perfecting foundation plus concealer in
the shade is 0.5 breeze this is a little
too dark for my skin so what I do is I
mix it with one pump of the covergirl
outlast stay fabulous 3 in 1 now the
Clinique does have a really really
interesting a little applicator as you
guys can see so technically I can't
really mix them if that makes sense so I
go in with one pump of this mixed
together with the oil and then I add
this on top in areas where I want to
touch up more I took it hormonal acne
along at my jawline it is that time of
the month so that is usually where I've
been going this week but my skin has
been so flawless with the two of these
so many of you have been saying your
skin looks so good and I'm pretty sure
it's cuz I've been taking the shit out
of my face but you have really been
enjoying those so anyway guys those are
up my holy grails for the week
definitely let me know down below what
products you have been loving
and I will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
