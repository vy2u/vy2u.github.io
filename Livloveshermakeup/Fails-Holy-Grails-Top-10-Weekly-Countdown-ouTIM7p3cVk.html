channel today's video is going to be my
files and how the rails for the week and
I'm very excited because although it's
Friday and I normally post these on
Sundays I know you guys love fails and
holy grails which is where I talk about
products that work for me this week and
of course products that did not work for
me we are doing this in a top ten style
kind of countdown so the worst products
of the week than going into the best
products and yeah that's pretty much it
if you didn't know I will not be posting
this weekend I will not be posting next
weekends but I will be posting Monday
through Friday obviously this week and
then Monday through Friday and next week
we just have a really crazy schedule
going on right now if you saw my life
updates video which I'll go ahead and
throw up in the cards where you're
moving across the country it has like 12
days so there's a lot going on I still
wanted to get up and fails in Holy Grail
so that's why it's happening today which
is a Friday but yeah let's go ahead and
jump right into it so we're gonna start
with the worst products of the week
these were actually sent to me for PR in
exchange for an honest review from
octillion themselves the first one is a
phone case I have no idea why I thought
I should go ahead and order a phone case
off of octoly that was really just kind
of stupid this is from the brand Gresso
of gray so gr ESS oh they made it sound
like on the website these were really
durable really really nice phone cases I
specifically told them what kind of
phone I have and they sent me the wrong
one so I have an iPhone 7 and this is a
case for an iPhone 7 plus so it does not
fit on to my phone I thought the little
pattern was super super cute a few
little hibiscus flowers and stuff like
that and then as you can see there is a
glitter that comes down off the actual
phone case now the glitter tends to get
really stuck at the top and then it
actually covers up the flowers so so
much so even though this doesn't fit on
my phone even if it did I don't think I
would like this phone case that much
it really feels super super cheap to me
as well and this took forever to ship
here so quite a few complaints there but
I just wanted to say it's really not for
me not happy with that that is probably
the last time I will ever go ahead and
order a actual phone case on the octoly
website alright and then the other
product I really wanted to love because
I have been enjoying this brand a lot it
is from 100% pure this is the blood
orange cleansing balm it is 100% natural
100% vegetarian 100 percent gluten free
as well as 100% cruelty free this is
what it looks like on the inside as you
can see I dug in
I really really tried with this product
you guys I prefer the other leg elf
nourishing oil to foam cleanser which
I'll show you guys in a second some of
the other elf makeup removers that I
picked up this is just way way way too
oily so I'm thinking of using it kind of
as like a foot exfoliator maybe mixing
in some sugar and using it on my feet at
nighttime it just leaves way too much of
an oily residue it says to put it on and
then go in with a cognac sponge or a
washcloth to rub it off even when I do
that with like a damp cognac sponge or
my Clarisonic or my Luna or anything
like that it still doesn't come off it
leaves a very very thick layer of oil on
my skin and I'm not a fan so although I
love the brands although I love a lot of
the products but they do have this just
did not work for me so that is he failed
for the week alright let's go ahead and
get into some of the good stuff for the
week and let's see here 7th place we
have India Palladio matcha blush in D
shade at peach ice this is what it looks
like a very very basic looking and
honestly it doesn't have too much
pigmentation it's barely their kind of
blush but I have been loving this
because what I do is I put this on and
then I go in with a blush topper so
maybe like the shimmering Swan highlight
from pretty vulgar cosmetics or maybe
one of the becca blush kind of toppers
from the Chrissy Teigen palette it's
just a really really nice kind of base
because it doesn't have too much
pigmentation it is matte and if I go
with a blush topper it usually is like a
highlight that's too dark for me so it
gives a little bit of a sheen but yeah
this is a great blush really really nice
kind of base product so I have been
enjoying that I also have been loving at
the first saw a unicorn essence skin
enhancing antioxidant serum now this is
one of those products that's like super
hyped up and a lot of you were like
really is it actually that good and now
I don't use it as a serum I do not think
the ingredients in here are good enough
to be used as a skin serum however as an
actual primer this is pretty damn good
as you guys can see it is pink it does
have sparkles in it it smells like
marshmallows yeah it smells like candy
it smells super super good what I like
to do is just deposit what a full
dropper fill into my hands I like
massage it together like this and then I
push it into the skin within 45 seconds
I go in with my foundation or my tinted
moisturizer my base and you know what to
my makeup lasts all day long so this is
a very very good primer but you need to
go in with your base products right away
so that it sticks and kind of adheres to
the product but I've really been
enjoying this I think it makes a great
primer I
I have been loving my hourglass
modernist eyeshadow pellet in the
obscura version for quite a few weeks
now so this is what it looks like on the
inside and a lot of people do not like
the formula on this it is very very
powdery like when you put your brush in
there it explodes all over the place but
I will say I feel like this is a very
forgiving eyeshadow palette because you
can blend it out to almost nothing so if
you go in with this really deep
chocolatey brown color right there and
you're like oh that's not working
you literally can blend it away you
don't have to wipe anything you don't
have to go in with a makeup remover wipe
or anything like that you can just blend
it away so I find it to be very
forgiving it is very travel friendly as
you guys can see it's a really small
little compact almost the size of my
palm and I do like the colors in there
because their everyday friendly you can
wear it very lightly on your eyes or
smoke out your eyeshadow and I really do
like it alright next we do have two
different skin care products the first
one is the ALP nourishing oil to FOMA
cleanser this is a really really good
cleanser like this guy right here I
think is around 35 or $40 from 100% pure
this is $10 for five fluid ounces if you
want something that's going to remove
your makeup with no oily residue go for
the elf but not saying that this is
something that nobody's going to like I
feel like there are a few people that
would like this particular product but
it's just way too greasy it takes way
too much effort to get off and this is
great because it is like that foam it
gates could basically live just spray it
all over me it is basically an oil and
then it turns into a foam so you put it
on your hands I take about five
different pumps and then I kind of rub
it together put it onto dry skin and
then it turns into a foam you rinse it
off it takes off all of your face makeup
no matter how much face makeup you have
on it we'll take it off I do usually
have to go back in with about two or
three pumps for my eye area but overall
this is really really good and like I
said five fluid ounces for ten dollars
is a freaking steal orange and then the
other skin care products I have been
loving is from Mario Badescu it is the
glycolic acid a toner it says right here
it's very good for combination and dry
skin dry skin because this is a very
good exfoliating sort of product it is a
skin thinner so make sure you do go
ahead and follow up with a sunscreen if
you're going to use it during the
daytime I like to use it at nighttime
it's just so beautiful it helps with
acne it helps to exfoliate the skin it
helps with dry patches it does so much
good stuff especially if you do have
combination skin so I'm going to join
this a lot really helps with breakouts
in my t-zone I tend
very oily in my t-zone during the
summertime so I've been loving that and
now let's go ahead and get into the top
three products of the week the first one
is from Tarte this is the energy noir
lip surgence skin intuitive lip gloss
that is what it looks like and I just
absolutely love this habit on my lips
right now you probably can't even tell
but I am usually not a lipgloss kind of
girl this is what the actual color looks
like it basically just stains the lip so
it actually goes on kind of like this
ashy kind of smoky color and then what
it does is it gives you a little bit of
a purple tint on your lips it's
extremely extremely buttery and smooth
and creamy
I'm pretty sure they discontinued this
which is so stupid this was such a good
product I also have the regular energy
one but yeah I think they discontinued
this formula goodness gracious card I
feel like Tarte it just continues all
the good stuff like why please don't but
yeah this is a beautiful beautiful gloss
if you can find it sometimes I do see it
on at these sephora.com sale section I
would definitely scoop it up it's
beautiful the energy one is a little
more pink tone to this one is obviously
a little more purpley tone but just so
beautiful on the lips and then the
second product number two for the week
is definitely this guy right here I love
this so many people don't like this but
I got this and up and leave a glossy box
a couple months ago it is the immediate
makeup active I liked corrector so
basically I would describe this as being
like an eye cream mixed in with a little
bit of like a yellow tone corrector it
says on the bottom there that it is
anti-aging that is what the consistency
looks like the consistency is a
beautiful if you want something that's
going to be very softening and very very
beautiful underneath the eye area I
would definitely go for this now I do
have on two or three layers of
self-tanner today and I feel like this
blends in with my skin perfectly when
I'm not self-tan it is a little too dark
a little too yellow toned but because it
has that sort of creamy base like that I
cream in there it really is flattering
underneath the eyes it's not going to
settle into fine lines and wrinkles
that's not going to emphasize any sort
of texture it just glides on beautifully
so if you do a more mature skin or even
combination skin like I do you're
starting to get little fine lines and
wrinkles to the very flattering
under-eye corrector and finally guys the
number one product for the week is
actually from Tarte I feel like
is one of those brands where when it is
like the Amazonian clay face products
they really do work well this is
actually e BB tinted a moisturizer I
cannot believe I have been wearing a
tinted moisturizer all week a lot of you
have been complimenting my skin this
week and it's just crazy to me that this
is just coming from a tinted moisturizer
so this is the Amazonian clay BB tinted
moisturizer in the shade ivory it does
have SPF 20 in it which is awesome and
it is a let's see here is it a NAT VI
it's titanium and zinc oxide if you're
curious so it is a physical sunblock
which is really really nice if you do
have more sensitive skin so I really
like this it says it's oil-free
antioxidant rich formulated without
parabens mineral oil phenyl AIDS or
theta lates
I think theta lights triskele and sodium
lauryl sulfate in gluten it's just a
very long wearing for a tinted
moisturizer it feels like absolutely
nothing on the skin I take a pretty
large amount onto a damp sponge I would
say usually about that much or even more
but I'm not going to put on the back of
my hand cuz I'm just wasting it now but
I take a large amount of this and then I
just kind of blend it in with a damp
sponge and it goes on beautifully it
hydrates just a little bit I do feel
like it is the longest wearing you know
tinted moisturizer that I do have in my
collection and the color although it is
a little light for me currently it
blends in beautifully so if you want a
nice lightweight sort of a tinted
moisturizer to wear during the summer
time you don't want something that's
like almost a BB cream like a little
even more heavy than if you would enjoy
this that's what I'm trying to say so
anyway guys those anyway guys are my top
10 products for the week I'm going crazy
did a bunch of pre-filming today so I
just I can't speak but anyway I hope you
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me and I will see you guys in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
