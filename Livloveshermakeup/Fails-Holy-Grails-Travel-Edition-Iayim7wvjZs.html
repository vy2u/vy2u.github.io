welcome back to my bottle sent out of
rails where I share with you guys new
products I've been loving this week and
of course the products I have not been
loving I'm obviously in a bathroom right
now as you can probably tell it is very
echoey there's a towel behind me things
like that I do apologize I am still on a
vacation so this was the best lighting
that I could find in the house but yeah
I'm here to share with you guys my
travel favorites and fails for the least
let's go ahead and jump right into it
there are a lot of fails so let's go how
to get started the first one is from it
cosmetics this is the superhero mascara
I feel like I'm the only person who
doesn't really like this I love the
packaging this is exactly how if I were
to make a mascara this is what I would
want the packaging to look like this is
just a little too dry for me you guys I
don't know what it is I normally like a
very very wet mascara or a very dry
mascara like too faced better than sex
mascara very dry I like that a lot but
this is just way way way too dry
actually starts to flake off and like
release onto my cheek bones throughout
the day I think it looks horrible I
don't like I just don't like that it's
so dry now I do think it gives volume
and it does build a lot of length and it
does give some definition I like how it
looks when you first apply it but
throughout the day this is just not a
good mascara definitely not a favorite
for me
the second fail for the week has
definitely been the origins ginseng
refreshing scrub cleanser this is what
it looks like again I feel like a lot of
people love this I personally did not I
feel like you can get something at the
drugstore for a lot cheaper
um the product that I'm thinking of is
the clean and clear morning burst facial
scrub that one is basically like a
cleanser with a scrub in one and it has
like an orange scent to it
same exact thing it literally is three
dollars and forty nine cents at altos
and you get way more product in there so
I would highly recommend picking that up
instead of this it's pretty much the
same exact thing although origins does
have better ingredients I don't really
see a difference between the two so this
was definitely a fail for me this week
another fail for me again from origins
is the ginseng energy boosting treatment
lotion mist I also did not like this I
was very confused as to what this
product was at first I thought oh it's a
lotion mist for that move that's kind of
like an essence or a toner it's not it
basically is just a facial mess and I do
have a hard time actually noticing a
difference when I use facial mist
sometime
I noticed an immediate difference like
it gives me a lot of hydration to the
face or it gives me a nice cooling
sensation and then other times it just
feels good to put on the skin this is
one of those facial myths that
unfortunately it just feels good to put
on the skin it doesn't smell like
oranges which you guys know I love
oranges and I love that citrusy kind of
scent but I would not qualify this as
being a treatment that actually does
nothing for your skin or like a facial
mist that does something for your skin I
know a lot of people say facial mist
don't do anything for your skin ever but
I notice the difference when I use my
Mario Badescu one and I so miserly
climbs so yeah I'm not a fan of this who
would not purchase a full-size of that
and the last feel for the week it's from
Laura Mercier this is the foundation
primer in the radiance version this was
I believe a 100 or 200 point perk from
Sephora and this just reminds me a lot
of the Becca back like priming filter if
you've been watching me for a while you
know I am NOT a fan of that primer
whatsoever I've been trying to use it up
like for the past four publicly I think
four or five project pans videos which
is ridiculous it's like the product from
hell in my opinion it's just digging
forever to get through so I'm not even
to be on this at least a very very shiny
look to the skin it's not anything like
you have to put foundation on top of
this and the back of one for it to look
natural I feel like if you were to put a
pump of the back on and just go out in
public it looks weird like your face
would actually look super super shiny so
it's just not a very natural looking
primer and I do not think that it
prolonged the wear of my foundation so I
did not like that all right let's go
ahead and get into the Holy Grail the
first Holy Grail has definitely been my
Urban Decay vice lipstick palette this
is what it looks like I absolutely adore
this I have two different colors mixed
together on my lips right now I was just
out shopping with my mom at Target so it
kind of started to wear off but I am
bringing the shades speedball and
Firebird and mixed together and this is
what it looks like and it is absolutely
stunning I wore a little bit of that
green shade on Christmas which I know
like you should wear a red lip on
Christmas but now I wore green lipstick
it was amazing it's beautiful I love
this I think it's so compact and travel
friendly so I really really have been
enjoying that I also have been so
thankful to have my lorac mega pro 3
with me I've been taking so many
pictures of this with my new camera on
Instagram and the reason for that is
because
I forgot all my brow products I forgot
to my highlighter and I forgot my blush
palette at home so I basically have been
using this for eyeshadow blush and also
highlight today I do have on these
shades snow as my actual highlights and
then I have this shade of pomegranate on
as my actual blush so I just kind of
taper together my brush and I kind of
dip in there and then apply it and it
really works well I feel like these go
on beautifully on the cheeks and on the
skin and you wear that you put them but
I've been really really thankful that I
brought this with so yes I have been
loving on my lorac mega Pro 3 a lot I do
not like how dirty this gets but it is
really really wonderful as far as like
applying that kind of stuff is concerned
I have been loving these two little
jewel and des brushes here from Tarte so
I did bring the whole holiday 2016 is
set so all the brushes that came in that
I did bring them but these are the
double-ended ones and these are just so
great for travel so this one is be like
blushed and highlight so there you can
see that I used at the pomegranate shade
for the blush right here it's really
nice it fits right on to the apple of
the cheeks and then this little guy for
highlighting is not too bad it's kind of
like using a tapered like blending brush
but like a tapered highlighting brush so
you just put it right onto your cheek
bones down the bridge of your nose it's
actually very fluffy and not too dense
so it applies highlight really really
wonderfully so I have been enjoying that
and then this guy right here is
foundation and concealer so this is the
foundation side this applies your
foundation so freaking beautifully you
guys I've been using a stick foundation
and basically I just spray it down with
a little bit of setting this and then I
kind of pulled down in downwards
stroking motions and I just feel like it
applies that foundation really really
nicely and then the concealer side is
nice as well you can also use this to
apply your foundation if you want to but
it's really nice for tapping in your
concealer so I have been loving that a
lot and then I also have been loving my
Too Faced hangover RX this is the
replenishing the face primer so although
I have not been loving the Laura Mercier
Vaughn I think this one goes really
really nicely with the actual foundation
that I have been using this week which
is the anastacio Beverly Hills stick
foundation if you're curious so and this
is wonderful it says they have coconut
water probiotics and some sort of skin
revive errs in it whatever it just feels
really good on the skin and I do want a
primer to actually do what it's supposed
to I feel like nowadays all these
primers are
like poor filling or hydrating and
that's all they do like they don't
extend the wear of your foundation but I
actually do feel like this one does so I
have been loving that I also have been
loving my Elizabeth and James Nirvana
rose bourbon a roll-on so I am never
going to travel with like a spray
perfume ever again I don't think I feel
like Rowland's are just perfect when you
are traveling because you literally can
just paint them on wherever you want and
they just go on so nicely this one
actually lasts a lot longer than the
spray version in my opinion I will say I
noticed that the Elizabeth and James
Nirvana bourbon perfume wears off really
really quickly this one stays on really
nicely I don't know if it's just because
it's a little more potent because it is
a rollerball but it's beautiful I have
been loving that a lot I also have been
loving my Ulta micellar water makeup
removing cleansing pad so I have mostly
been using these to remove eye makeup
and also I have been using them to do a
quick cleanse in the morning on my face
they are not my favorite like micellar
product ever I recently did a whole
review on 10 different micellar waters
I'll go ahead and link that down below
if you want to know which ones are my
favorites but this is what the little
pad looks like and I do feel like it is
nice for travel instead of carrying like
a bottle of micellar water with you so
it does remove makeup pretty nicely
they're not like scented or anything so
I do enjoy those and then this little
guy right here I'm right in between I
don't know if I love this or I hate it
it is the dry bar detox dry shampoo it
is that it says absorbs oil oils and
freshens up the hair and I really do
feel like it does but you guys this
leaves like an insane white cast in your
hair my mom the other day literally was
like um do you have gray hairs already I
was like no no I don't like what's going
on here it's this product it really
didn't leave a white cast so if you have
very very dark hair do not use this I
have like a dirty blonde or light brown
natural hair color and this is
ridiculous it really lightens up your
hair a lot so I don't like it because of
that but at the same time I like it
because I feel like it absorbs oils like
no other I am NOT somebody who I've been
washing my hair like crazy lately
because if you guys didn't know I have
some really bad scarring on the back of
my scalp right now from lupus and it
really hurts to wash my hair like
the shower that's what sons are well but
it really hurts so I have been trying
not to wash my hair as frequently just
so that those scars can kind of heal up
and kind of you know just not I don't
want to keep breaking them open
basically I'm sorry I'm Sonny doing I'm
talking about this but this has been
great because I really do feel like it
absorbs the oils and it will make like
four day hair look like one day hair
like it looks really really good so I
love this but like I hate it at the same
time didn't really know where to feature
that one I have been loving the
voluminous butterfly mascara from
L'Oreal I'm trying to get away from
using too many L'Oreal products because
they are so like this brand really tests
on animals very very heavily they're one
of the worst like on the market
basically but this is what the ones it
looks like and this is what I'm wearing
on my eyelashes today I really like the
way it goes on it was just one coat I
feel like it gives really really nice
length and definition and also looks
kind of wispy like a butterfly wing so I
do like this and I will use a nap but I
probably wouldn't repurchase and like I
said I have been loving that anastacio
Beverly Hills stick foundation is just
fantastic something that I've been
really really happy with is this little
guy right here this is my Luna sleeping
at night oil from Sunday Riley this is
what I have been wearing on my skin at
nighttime I did not bring the lactic
acid treatment because normally you want
to mix this together with good genes but
I've just been using this I've been very
happy I was dealing with a lot of dry
skin before I got here so a couple of
days before I would like to even want to
bring the lactic acid treatment because
that can kind of dry out the skin so
this has been beautiful because I feel
like I get the retinol benefits and it
helps take care of breakouts and things
like that but I also does hydrate my
skin so I've been a big fan of that and
the final item that I have been loving
is the body shots that sue my gel lotion
and this is what it looks like it is
amazing it smells just like freshly cut
oranges I won't say that this is
extremely hydrating because it's not if
you were really really dry on your body
this is not going to do it for you but
it smells absolutely incredible you
definitely can check out their body
butters if you want something more
hydrating but I've been really really
happy with that so those are my failed
and holy
Travel edition I hope you guys enjoyed
