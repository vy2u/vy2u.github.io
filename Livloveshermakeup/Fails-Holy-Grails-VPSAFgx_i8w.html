sorry every time I press the button the
camera just shakes welcome back to my
veils and hug rails where I share with
you guys the products that have been
working for me this week that are my
Holy Grail and then I share the fails as
well so we're going to start with the
fails because I like to end things on a
good note there is only one this week
and it is the josie maran argan daily
moisturizer with SPF 47 SPO 47 went over
your head so funny anyway um the reason
I did not like this personally what's
because it has a natural sunscreen in in
just let me say something really quickly
I really do personally like physical
soundblox I think that they're really
nice on the skin if your acne prone if
you have like problematic skin that
breaks out with chemical sunscreens I
think physical some blocks are fantastic
however it's the combination of argan
oil with a physical sunblock in this
particular product that just leaves me a
hot oily mess like I will put this on
and then I'll put on my foundation like
my primer and then my foundation and I'm
just like literally this eats up my
foundation on my skin which is really
hard to believe because this week I've
been loving my clinique beyond
perfecting foundation and concealer and
this is super like heavy duty coverage
and this still will eat up the product
on my skin so I think the fact that it
has the physical sun block which is
already Gracie combined with argan oil
which is already pretty Gracie as well I
think it just is too much on my skin I
would personally out like return this
product but it came in like a little
whimsical wonder set and I love
everything else that I got with that so
I can't actually return it I will use it
I think I would wear it if I went to the
beach or something like that and I
wasn't wearing any sort of face product
but for the most part this was just too
oily on my face and it ate up all of my
makeup so that is my fail for the week
now let's get into the Holy Grail so let
me just go ahead and start with the
foundation I've been loving the Clinique
beyond perfecting foundation + concealer
my shade is 0.5 breezed I didn't call
first impressions on this i did a first
impressions follow up my god this is
just such a good foundation one even
layer of this all over your face just
kind of smell like paint but one even
layer of this all over your face really
really nice full coverage foundation
that's just going to like blur any sort
of imperfections on your skin really
really good price for one fluid ounce
only twenty seven dollars at sephora
which is like extremely excluded
extremely extremely cheap for a high-end
foundation in my opinion so yes I have
been absolutely loving that this week
and I have been pairing it with my mixed
color correcting concealer palette now
one of my subscribers hunger Lena she
asked me on instagram she was like do
you actually like that because she knows
and I think all of you guys know that I
have recently picked up shitloads of
light color correcting products like a
lot of high-end color correcting
products this is really the only drug
store one that I have and I think people
are having a hard time believing that I
like this one as much as the high-end
ones but seriously i love this as much
as I love my Urban Decay color
correcting fluid so I highly highly
recommend they are color correctors plus
concealers built into one and they're
just amazing the only shady don't like
in here is the contouring shade but the
peach shade right here this one right
here oh my god it's so nice like super
creamy wonderful underneath the eyes and
also on the eyelids for brightening and
then of course you have the green for
correcting redness you have the yellow
for brightening purple for you know
filling in fine lines and wrinkles love
this and yes I do love it just as much
as some of the other color correcting
products that i have recently picked up
i think what makes this extra special is
the fact that i also has those
concealing properties so you can use
this to color correct and conceal your
face you don't need to go in with an
extra concealer so yeah been loving that
the next products i have been loving is
my fragrance 20 for the week let's just
go right into that I have impairing my
post Ibaka Brazilian mango grapefruit
yes Brazilian may go grapefruit I bet
you can imagine how are the smells it
smells amazing I've been pairing this
with it be I call in a little away I
Connolly I Connolly I don't know how to
say this man I think if I kona la Leela
Louis it's something i Kona late okay
and this is the body fragrance being
playful lychee this just makes me smell
like a piece of fruit like so yummy I
love the two of these together this is
more of like a fragrance mist and then
this is just a straight-up perfume the
two of these together heaven love
alright moving on let's talk about like
cleansing my face in the morning I have
been loving my be fine food skincare
exfoliating cleanser with brown sugar
sweet almond and
I have loved this product for a very
long time this is the fourth tube that I
have gone through I use this in the
morning it's a really really nice gritty
scrub that turns into a foam on the face
it's like magic it's amazing it really
really helps my skin if you have oily or
combination skin I think you would love
this it's just a wonderful wonderful
product and it really really helps to
prep my skin before putting makeup on so
I love that i also have been loving my
bath and body works aromatherapy will
have an itch in my ear oh god yeah okay
my bath and body works aromatherapy
stress relief eucalyptus T luxury bath I
love these luxury bath like products you
guys know you've probably seen a million
of them I did break the lid I don't know
what happened yes but anyway this one
smells really really good it's a very
nice for spring it's not too heavy of a
scent with the lavender vanilla one or
the chamomile one really really love it
and it's got their kind of sweetness in
it so this has been really nice this
week i also have been loving that just
coconut everything everything coconut
i've been using the trader joes coconut
body butter on my body and right now I'm
kind of transitioning into legged the
warmer months and my skin is starting to
get a little more oily I'm not dealing
with like you know psoriasis or eczema
on at my hands anymore I'm really just
my body's just getting oily okay I'm hot
oily mess okay so I open enjoy using
this just on areas where I'm still kind
of dry like my legs my feet and then
also my knees or like my elbows but this
is amazing if you have never tried this
oh my god it smells like coconut
frosting it has the consistency of
coconut frosting this is so good and
this is like under four or five dollars
at trader joe's you need to try this out
it's the shea butter in it it has
vitamin E oil it's amazing and then in
my glossybox this month I got this I
love coconut and cream super soft hands
lotion oh my god it really does smell
like coconut and cream like vanilla and
coconut mixed together loving this I
just feel like an exotic goddess when I
put this on my hands okay i love it
alright let's talk about my shampoo for
the week so my hair has been feelin a
little dry just like kind of like crispy
and dry and gross so I oh my god I
haven't you think my
Shea Moisture raw shea butter moisture
retention shampoo with seek help and
argan oil for dry damaged hair I love
the Shea Moisture brand and this
particular product really does put
moisture back into your hair and if
you'll find here like I do it puts a
little too much moisture back into your
hair so I find that this can be a little
heavy it doesn't like lather up on your
scalp or anything like that because it
doesn't have sulfates in it and I
normally don't like that it smells a
little strange but I swear to god it
makes my hair look so nice and healthy
and silky probably not today because I
have like six cans of dry shampoo in
there right now cuz I didn't wash it
last night but you get the drift alright
so I really really love it I do
recommend if you are using this and you
do have fine here mix in a little bit of
a clarifying shampoo I personally love
the suave one or the Neutrogena anti
residue just because this can weigh your
hair down a little bit and can leave a
little bit of a residue but honestly so
so good if you have any sort of hair
type you would love this product alright
let's talk about a food item already
drink item you guys know I've been
loving making iced tea lately I love
this SI e green tea super fruity from
the republic of tea i put 10 teabags yes
Jen into my little um I can't I remember
what this is called it's like the fruit
infusing pitcher thing I put 10 tea bags
in there and then I put water in and
then I let it sit overnight and it just
makes wonderful wonderful i love green
tea i love the taste of it it makes
wonderful green tea that has like a hint
of sweetness you do not need to
artificially like sweetness at all it
tastes so good and i just have been so
into ice tea so yeah this is the acai
green tea from the republic of tea i
highly recommend checking out that brand
as well they're like they have some
really really good products all right
let's move on to another hair item I've
been loving my it's a 10 miracle
leave-in plus keratin I've used like
half of this container up and the reason
I'm so obsessed with this one I have the
silk express one I have the original one
and I have this one there's something
about this one and everybody says bells
like literally
every time I see someone mentioned this
they're like this one's the best but
honestly this one is the fact I don't
know what it is but it just makes your
hair feel so much softer and it's kind
of strange because normally when you put
keratin into your hair it's just posed
to strengthen your hair and actually too
much keratin can cause more breakage but
this one just makes my hair feel like
silky soft this is the only leave in
product i've been using all week and i
love it so yeah the it's a 10 miracle
leave-in plus keratin from asking this
week I've been loving my olay henriksen
truth sugar glow polishing mask I've
used pretty much like all of this up I
only have a little bit left it's so good
smells like an orange creamsicle and it
just has this really really gritty
formula that really helps to exfoliate
your skin you put this on dry skin rub
it around a little bit and then you
leave it on for about five minutes it
has honey in here which is like a
natural antiseptic and deceptive you say
that right it helps to like you know
clear the gunk out of your skin and it's
also like antimicrobial antibacterial
and it honestly leaves no sticky residue
on my face yes when you do have it on if
you have like hair that's like these
little baby here is that around there it
will get stuck so put your hair back in
a headband but honestly when you wash it
off there is no residue on your face and
I just love it because it really
brightens up my complexion so that has
been my favorite mask for the week now
as far as cleansing goes at nighttime
like I said that'd be fine i've been
using that in the morning i like using
something exfoliating in the morning to
kind of prep my skin for makeup but at
nighttime i've been using this glam glow
thirsty cleanse daily hydrating cleanser
I completely use this app so I'm going
to toss it in my empties been after this
but you guys oh this is so good and I
loved it so much that i went ahead and
placed an order on so far if you guys
watch the Sephora haul i'll link it down
below but i did a Sephora haul the other
day where i did end up picking up in
full size of the super mud cleanser and
the reason I got that one was because
this one's more for dry skin whereas the
white one or the super cleanse is more
for like problematic acne oily prone
skin and I just think that would be
better for me during the summertime but
yeah this was amazing i would definitely
purchase a full size of this but i think
it would be better for me during like
the winter time but love that top set in
he's been all right let's talk about I
shadow this week because I've been going
very very neutral okay I can already
hear this little thing clicking around
in here one of them already fell out but
I have been going pretty neutral on my
eyes this week I've been wearing kind of
poppy colors on my lips so I've been
loving the bhcosmetics wild child baked
eyeshadow palette now i have made myself
a promise now i don't really know if
it's a promise i'm trying to get myself
to rotate each week between high end and
drugstore palettes because i have a lot
of high-end pounds but i have even more
drugstore pallets so i'm trying to get
myself to go ahead and alternate each
week so this past week i used the beach
cosmetics one this is a palette that is
under five dollars and then this coming
week i'm going to go ahead and use a
high-end palette so i'm trying to go
back and forth but i love this palette
you'd get nine is it nine in here
getting you get nine baked eye shadows
in here and you can probably say you're
really been dipping in certain ones I'm
today I'm writing that dark purple shade
here in my crease and then i have this
shade on at my lid this in the inner
corner and then this again on my lower
lashline so just like three or four
eyeshadows really really pretty when you
use them dry it they look very natural
and shiny on the eyes you can even spray
your brush with like fix plus or i don't
know why i always say fix plus i don't
even have max this fix plus okay you can
spray them with any sort of setting
spray i think i just say that because
everybody always says oh make six bucks
never have tried it go ahead and spray
your brush with any sort of setting
spray but it will make them completely
foil so they go on a lot more pigmented
and smoother and super super shiny but
i've been using them dry this week and i
love them i think you get a nice color
arrangement in here they're just really
beautiful and I like the colors I like
the way they look on my eyes very very
subtle kind of natural look so yeah I've
been wearing that too sweet for
eyeshadows now let's talk about lip
products because i have been wearing
kind of poppy lip colors and everybody
has been asking what i've been wearing
so today i have on well all of them are
the maybelline Vivid's first of all but
today i am wearing the pink pop shade
and this is also the one I
wearing in my review videos for the
tarts items like a couple of days ago
this is so not my color but I told
myself I was like why do you own it if
it's not your color you better use it
okay so anyway this is like not my color
I one of those people I would much
rather wear a red lipstick then like a
nude or light pink color I always felt
like it washed my complexion out it
never looked good on me I thought I look
dead but I have been loving this color
this week and you guys have really been
commenting on the videos where I'm
wearing like the purple lipstick or the
pink one so yeah this is the shade
pinkpop this is from the Maybelline
Vivid's collection and there it is
swatched on my hand just a really nice
light pink shade the second one I've
been wearing is the shade Arab and berry
which is like a purpley pink color it
looks a lot more like scary in the tube
than it is on the actual lips sorry I
just heard my room book come out please
excuse him but anyway this is what brass
and Barry looks like so we have pink pop
and then browse and Barry and then I've
been wearing to kind of orange / red
shades the first one is called vivid
Mandarin and I love this it's like an
orange e pinky red color I don't even
know how to describe it but it's
beautiful there is vivid Mandarin and
then the last one is on fire red which
is gorgeous just like a straight up like
true red color with like a blue
undertone really really love that one as
well so I have just been loving really
really bright lipsticks this week and
that's kind of why I've been wearing
like a more neutral eye but yes I've
been getting asked a lot about the
lipsticks I've been wearing this week
these are the ones all right let's move
on as far as eyeliner goes this week
I've been loving this malli ever color
starlight waterproof liner in the shade
black navy I feel like this really
defines my eyes and it actually makes my
blue eyes look a little more like in
your face like a little more poppy and
make them look very very blue I just
think it gives wonderful definition to
like the waterline and the tight line
it's beautiful really been loving that
as far as mascara is concerned I've been
peering two mascaras this one's a little
more on the natural side this is the
Physicians Formula organic we're just
the original one in the really cute
little fat chubby green packaging love
that
and then I've been hearing that with the
Too Faced better than sex that I've been
just putting on like a little can I
speak yes just been putting on a very
very light coat of both of these and
I've just been liking the kind of
natural lashes this week you guys know
I'm all about the club so that's
probably what you'll be seeing next week
but anyway I really been liking the more
cunning natural lashes this week so I've
been carrying the two of those together
let's talk about face primer because I
have really wanted glowy skin this week
look I've been all about that glow the
Becca backlight priming filter girl yes
got first of all oh my god it smells
like a goddess like literally it just
smells so good it smells like coconut
and like vanilla I love it and then when
you put it on your face it just gives
this beautiful sort of iridescent to
your actual skin like gorgeous like
literally you could wear this just by
itself and just getting gorgeous like
glowing complexion I feel like it
hydrates my skin I feel like it prolongs
aware of my makeup it doesn't have any
sort of like silicone in it so it
doesn't have any slip to it but my god
it really makes your skin look nice and
glowy and I've been all about that glow
alright let's talk a little bit more
about glowing the two-faced I'm
sweethearts bronzer the baixa luminous
glow bronzer and sweet tea has been at
favorite this week I love dusting this
with a really really fluffy brush on the
outer perimeters of my face I mean I
know I'm not tan but I feel like this
week's bee tan makes me feel hands no I
love it it's the perfect perfect color
for those who have fair skin like I do
it just gives a really like lit from
within sort of glow to the skin and I
love it so really really been enjoying
that just kind of doing the little three
shape you know like forehead cheek bone
and then underneath the jaw line not
really a contouring because technically
this has shimmer in it but I just love
the way it makes my skin glow let's talk
about blush because a lot of you have
been asking i have been wearing the gosh
cosmetics multicolored blush in the
shade number fifty pink pie all week
this is a product i'm trying to use up
in 2016 and i have been failing
miserably i've made a little bit of a
dance but you guys I'm super scared like
I already used up a lot of the products
that I am trying to use up in two
thousand
16 which is great but this one like I'm
no better than to choose like a powder
blush next time because these are so
hard to get through but I love this
color it really really pairs nicely with
that sweethearts bronzer and it just
gives me really like flushed appearance
to the cheeks it's right there and I
feel like paired with the bronzer if I
take a little bit of the bronzer on the
apples of my cheeks and then I go in
with that blush it just makes me look
very luminous and glowy so I love that
and I have been using that with my lexy
50 for large angled brush I got this in
my glossy boxes I'm just going to say
this week no I wish this month and I
really really enjoy this it's just super
super soft I like the angled aspect of
it because it really goes right onto the
apple of the cheek and then bring set up
towards the cheekbone love it really
really great and as far as highlight
goes this week i have been using another
luck zbrush this is the luck c 5 12
small contouring brush and I've been
using my Laura Geller baked gelato swirl
illuminator in the shade charming pink
this is one of the newer ones and I go
in with this and then I really buff it
into my skin this is one of those baked
jalaye formulations so you really need
to kind of buff it into the skin for it
to look natural and not just sit on the
skin so I've really been enjoying the
two of those weird together by the way
it got this Lexi brush that my boxy
charm box for them yes okay from lip
balm this week loving this chapsticks
moisturizing raspberry creme like a
smooth damn good love it and then the
final product I want to talk about is
the tacho luminous dewy skin vest I have
technically been setting in my makeup
with this but honestly this is not the
best like setting spray it does have
oils in it which kind of counteracts the
thought of actually setting in makeup
cuz make up our makeup because oil can
actually break down make up this is
filled with oil so what I like to do is
shake it up really nicely and just do a
nice little mist over my face and I feel
like it gets a little bit of a glow from
within after I have applied my makeup
alright guys this is a long ass video I
apologize those were my fails
girls for the week I hope you enjoyed
this video and i will see you tomorrow
