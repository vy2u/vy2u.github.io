happy Valentine's Day I hope you're all
having an absolutely fantastic day I'm
going to say something really quickly
I'm wearing this elf tinted lip balm on
my lips right now in the shade XO red
I've been wearing this for two and a
half hours do you see that look at that
pigmentation I know I've talked about
these before but my goodness this is a
great product my lips have been very
very dry this week and I cannot believe
that this is moisturizing and has that
kind of like opacity to it it's crazy
right all right anyway I'm here to share
my fields and holy grails with you guys
and it is Valentine's Day edition lots
of love in the air no actually there's
two fails but most of them are holy
grails lots of skincare this week and
also lots of hair care not too much
makeup so yes let's just get right into
it the first thing that did not work for
me this week was a hair product this is
the johnsons baby powder I heard of a
lot of people using this as a dry
shampoo it did not work for me
whatsoever it just really wait my hair
down and made it feel very greasy and
strange I didn't like the texture and I
just didn't like the way it looked
whatsoever especially when I was wearing
my hair up and yeah it just did not work
for me so this was the first fail for
the week and the second one I actually
am wearing on my eyes today go figure
and I actually have a tutorial going up
with this palette tonight at eight
o'clock however I just want to say
really really quickly it was because it
wasn't requested tutorial and um I
basically did a collab video with my
friend Amy earlier this week kind of
ranting about this product we both
aren't really a huge fan of these vice
our palates so I will leave that collab
video down below you're interested but
yeah the tutorial that's going out
tonight is using this palette and I do
like the eye look that I created I just
think that it's very unnecessarily
difficult palette to use if that makes
sense but this is what it looks like
beautiful beautiful colors it's just
really hard to blend and hard to use and
I'll talk about that a little more
tonight in the tutorial all right now
let's get on to the stuff that did work
for me this week let's start with this
baby right here this is the gold 12 dual
senses dual senses yeah dual senses
wants and highlights anti brass Muse
conditioner for luminous want and
highlighted hair I've been loving this
ivory
we got my hair done and it was really
really pulling a lot of golden tones I
naturally actually have like a very ashy
colored hair I feel like it was never
visible when I had virgin hair when i
first started filming last year when i
first started my youtube channel last
year you couldn't tell because the
lighting was so bad that it looked like
i just had dark brown hair but in
reality i actually have light blonde
ashley cool toned hair but any time I
bleach it it really pulls a lot of
brassy tones so I've been really really
enjoying this as my conditioner I
believe it all over my hair like I will
put it on my scalp all the way to my
ends and I leave it on for like 15
minutes in the shower and it really just
helps combat any sort of orange and
yellow tones and makes your hair look
really really nice and kind of like that
grayish color which I prefer I would
like to have an ashy blonde color not a
golden my hair exactly pulls more golden
but I would like to make it as Ashley as
hostile so I've been loving that I also
have been loving the jermack silver
brightening miracle leave-in
conditioning treatment this is a five
and one for all shades of silver grey
and blonde hair it conditions softens
brightens as shine and moisturizes so
this is basically just like a leap and
toner you guys can see it actually is
like um lavender toned and it's
wonderful I just feel like it really
does hold down any sort of golden tones
in my hair it helps add detangle and
moisturize and it's fantastic and then
the other hair products I've been loving
is the intense silk Express miracle silk
leave in the smells like jasmine it's
amazing I only spray it from my ear lobe
all the way down to my ends because it
is a very very thick and will weigh down
my fine hair if I put it on my roots but
it's absolutely fantastic and I like
that it's a spray bottle it's really
really easy to work with all right as
far as like face products go this week
I've only been using a CC cream no
foundation no concealer no primer I love
my color cut color girl i love my
covergirl plus ol a CC cream tone rehab
foundation in 105 ivory i don't know why
they call it a tone rehab foundation it
really is a CC cream it's so blendable
and easy to use and I think it's just
absolutely lovely so that has been a
favorite and i have been setting that
even with my essence all about
match-fixing compact powder this is like
a 399 powder you guys can see I
definitely love it
I have hit some major pan it's
absolutely fantastic and I just love how
it keeps my face Matt all day long
another makeup product that i've been
loving is my hourglass ambient lighting
edits palette i love this it's got a
bronzer in here two blushes and three
highlights it's just gorgeous really
really easy to use and I feel like you
can't really overdo it with hourglass
products they're just beautiful on the
skin today I am wearing a dim light at
the highlight and then I'm wearing the
bronzer in the shade luminous bronze
light on my cheeks as my blush and i
love it i think it's very very pretty
alright moving on let's talk about some
skin care at nighttime i have been using
two products that have actually been
making my skin purge and break out but i
love them it is the first one is the
kate somerville derma quench liquid lift
this has retinol in it and i really like
the texture of this it actually comes
out as a foam and it just sinks into the
skin really really quickly and then i
have been topping it with my only
hendrickson invigorating night treatment
this is a overnight restore poster with
a a chaise in it really really like this
if you have sensitive skin definitely
stay away but overall I kind of know
it's working it has been making my skin
purge and I've been getting little rant
and breakouts on my forehead which I am
somebody who normally gets breakouts
like along my jawline it's out of
hormonal acne for me so I know when a
product is making me break out because i
would get little active breakouts on my
forehead however this has even though it
has made me break out a little bit it is
completely smooth out the texture of my
skin so i'm going to continue using the
kate somerville derma quench it this
coming week all right in the morning
I've been loving my only henriksen truth
serum it smells like orange creamsicles
it's so good it has a lovely lovely
texture and it really does brighten the
skin and then to talk that i've been
using two new products from i like
organic skincare i actually found this
on hautelook this brand this is the
apricot whipped moisturizer this is
going to be fantastic if you have oily
skin combination skin it smells exactly
like apricots you guys know I'm huge on
sense oh my god it smells so good it's a
really really thick cream and actually
it goes on the skin completely white and
you really have to rub it in to like get
it to sink into your skin but you guys
this sinks in immediately I mean
immediately so I really really enjoy it
I think I'm gonna
this during the summer time and then the
other products from the I like organic
skincare line that I tried is this rose
hip toner I really like this cuz it's
actually a spray bottle so what you do
is just spray this toner right on to
your face and then you rub it in with
your fingers and that's it like it's
super super easy peasy lemon squeezy and
I absolutely adore it alright what else
as far as body wash goes yeah body wash
goes this week I've been loving this
product right here it is the bath and
body works aromatherapy sleep warm milk
and honey body wash and foam bath I have
not really used it as they bubble back
this week I've been using the same
bubble bath that I used last week which
is the alarm or see a creme brulee honey
bath but this one smells amazing to you
I've been loving anything with honey
milk and honey anything like that it's
amazing this has card in a minute and a
cinnamon essential oil really really
calming love it and it really does make
me feel nice and clean all right on
another cottage I've been loving for
hydrating my body is this little guy
right here from OGX it is the hydrating
argan oil of Morocco lotion sinks in
immediately and it smells really really
good and you get thirty percent more
product free in here I got this at
target the huge day so I really really
love this and then the last product that
i have been loving actually i'm sorry
there's two more this little guy was
covering one of them um this one is from
origins to stay out of trouble
ten-minute ask i've been wearing this
all week or I me not all week but I've
been using it all week I do mask
basically every other day I know I'm
going to get yelled with that from the
comment section but I swear my skin
loves to mask every other day so this
was nice it smells very very strongly of
eucalyptus so if you do not like that
sent you would not like this one but
it's really nice it helps clear up
breakouts and it also moisturizes the
skin so I've been enjoying that as my
math for the week and then the last
product now we're on the last product
that i've been loving this week is the
tony moly tangerine brightening hand
cream comes an adorable little tangerine
packaging like this and it smells like
tangerines it's got an amazing I've god
it's so so similar to the body shop
Satsuma sent if you love that scent I'm
talking to you Tiffany I got my friend
Tiffany into the set so I think she
would like this as well it is so so so
good if you love that citrusy orange
scent this is very similar to that one
but it's lovely it does have little
flecks of like um brightening properties
in there you probably won't even be able
to see but it's so nice and moisturizing
and that scent stays on your hands so
yeah I think that is it i do want to
mention one product i haven't been
wearing it all week but i've been loving
my elf lip glow in perfect pink just for
what i want to moisturize my lips
honestly you guys I haven't really been
wearing lip color this week except for
today but I do like this one so I wanted
to give it a little like honorable
mention so anyway those were my fails
and holy grounds for the week let me
know what your fails and holy grails
work for the week down below and I will
see you guys in tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
