my channel today's video is filmed on my
camcorder because I have a feeling it's
going to be over the 10-minute mark if
you didn't know my newer camera that I
have that I've been recording on does
not record for over 10 minutes at a time
which is ridiculous like when you spend
1500 bucks
you would think and then a camera will
record for a long time but go figure my
$300 camcorder films longer so anyway
let's go ahead and jump right into the
video today I do have my fabulous and
Holub rails to share with you guys but
we are going to be doing fails in holy
grills a little differently now so I
always basically just shared with you
guys the fails and then the holy grails
for the week a lot of you were saying
like if I could only choose two products
out of this whole entire video what
would you recommend and I thought you
know what what can I do to make it
easier for you guys I thought I could do
it in a countdown so basically I start
with the worst products and then I go
down to the best products of the week
and you know like those bottom 5 that
sounds weird and top 5 but bottom 5
products are the ones that I would
definitely definitely recommend to you
so like first place second place third
fourth fifth place those are like the
rider dies I thought this would also be
nice because that way I can also share
with you guys the products that I just
liked during the week and yeah that's
pretty much it so let's go ahead and
jump right into it we are going to start
with the worst product of the week it
holds the top spots because it's the
worst so does that make sense going down
to the best spot I hope that makes sense
so anyway this is the Sally Hershberger
24 karat supreme stylist voluminous dry
shampoo this is the worst dry shampoo I
have ever put in my hair you guys it
seriously please a very sticky tacky
waxy feeling in my hair and it's just
absolutely outrageous in my opinion it
does not get rid of any sort of oil I
think I got this in like a boxy charm or
a glossy box it is the worst dry shampoo
I've ever used so yeah I am never ever
going to touch this ever again alright
let's go ahead and get into the products
that are kind of like I kind of enjoy
them sometimes but for the most part
they're still kind of a fail the first
one is from 100% pure it is the cucumber
juice cleanser now this was sent to me
in exchange for an honest review from
octoly as well as the 100% pure brand
and although I have been enjoying a lot
of the 100% pure products unfortunately
this just doesn't really work that well
for me I use it as a second cleanse so
after I go in with my oil to remove my
makeup there's always just the tiniest
of
of makeup left and five pumps of this
yes you heard that right five pumps of
it does remove that residual makeup but
first of all that is a huge amount like
five pumps you guys can see right here
I've used a lot of this product and I
think I've only had it for about 15 or
20 days I feel like I'm gonna use this
up in a month and that seems very very
quick for a cleanser for me personally
also I do understand because it is a
foam you do need to use more but because
it is a foam you would think that would
be nice for sensitive skin it even says
right here 100% natural 100% vegan
cruelty free made for sensitive skin
this has a very very strong cucumber
scent to it I think it is going to be
extremely irritating for those of you
who actually have sensitive skin and in
my opinion this is not something I would
recommend to you guys if you have
sensitive skin or any sort of skin and
it is not something that I would
purchase with my own money so yeah that
is also kind of a fail for the week
alright moving on we have the original
pink of body spray from soap &amp;amp; Glory
this particular scent is the scent that
they have in the flake way scrub and
also the clean on me of body wash it is
amazing if you have never smelled that
before it is just incredible it's kind
of like a mixture of a cologne with a
perfume it smells really really good in
my opinion but I have to say this has
literally literally nowhere time you
guys it just wears off within 15 minutes
I have been using this for the whole
entire week and I'm halfway through the
bottle I feel like I started up here
like during the week and now it's
literally down here so that is very very
disappointing to me it's not something
that I would repurchase if you love that
scent I mean you could pick it up but
just know that you have to reapply it
all day long so if you are going to get
this I would definitely do it when they
have like the buy one get one 50% off
thing to kind of make it worth your
money but it is an amazing amazing
fragrance I wish they would make this
into like an Eau de Parfum spray that
would be awesome
alright I'm moving on we have the laura
geller eyecare waterproof eyeliner this
is just something that's just okay to me
the reason why I really do enjoy it is
because if you guys can see my waterline
this gives a banana sort of color to the
eye like the actual eye and it's very
very eye opening very very brightening
very beautiful it says it is the I care
waterproof eyeliner in the shade eye
brightener / banana and I really like
the retractable liner
I think it's nice and soft it's very
comfortable to put on
only problem is it's really doesn't have
a lot of pigment to it I feel like my
wet and wild $3 or $1 eye pencil it's
literally called like eyeliner slash
eyebrow pencil puts on that color
smoother and more pigmented than this
does so although I love the shade
because it is not a stark white you know
it has like a little bit of yellow hue
to it and I can't seem to find that
anywhere else like especially at the
drugstore although I do like that I just
don't feel like the pigmentation is
there you really really have to work it
up on your actual you know waterline I
think I had to do six or seven passes
today which is kind of ridiculous so
love it and kind of hate it I would say
that's just kind of falls into the like
category all right let's get into the
kind of better stuff like really really
good stuff the first one is the tart
shaped tape concealer now this is in the
shade fair I only use about two or three
dots underneath my eyes and then one on
my eyelid I've been pairing this
together with a couple foundations I'm
going to show you guys in a minute but
it is a beautiful beautiful concealer
the more I use this the more I like it
do I love it more than my Tarte
rainforest with the C concealer no I do
prefer a natural concealer on a day to
day basis but lately I have been getting
a lot of redness and darkness underneath
my eyes I think I'm starting to get a
little bit of allergies or something
like that I've never been one to have a
ton of allergies but I can tell the kind
of dark circles that I'm getting are
very very just like irritated um you
know sinuses basically so this has been
really really nice I do enjoy it and
like I said it's not the best concealer
in the world in my opinion a little goes
a very long way you do not need to
slather this all the way down to
your nose and in a triangle I know you
see people do that all the time on
YouTube you can do whatever the hell you
want I'm not trying to tell you what to
do with your makeup but I'm just letting
you know if you do purchase this you
don't need to use that much a little
goes a very long way I use two dots of
it today and I completely concealed
everything underneath my eyes which is
awesome so I really have been enjoyed
that this week I also have been loving
loving loving my wedding well to make a
glow highlighting powder it's not in the
top five but it's still pretty damn good
this is what it looks like it is a
beautiful beautiful kind of grayish rose
gold kind of shade that's how I would
describe its got like a grey base but I
have a rose gold sheen to it and you
guys can see it is just so shiny so
beautiful on the skin it is a Baker
should lay a formula I recently did a
video all about my favorite baked chilly
highlights I'll go ahead and throw that
up
cards for you guys but this is something
I would highly recommend even if you do
have fair skin you can use it how I have
been using it what I do is I use this as
a blush topper so after I go in with my
blush I will take the same sort of brush
and then I will put this on top of my
cheekbones and on top of like the apples
of my cheeks exactly where I would apply
a blush and it gives a beautiful
beautiful glow from within kind of thing
going on I did try and rock this out on
my cheekbones the other day just as a
highlight it was too dark you could even
see in the video it was too dark but it
still is a beautiful highlight and I
really really do enjoy it I hope that
they release more shades of this for the
more fair complected princesses out
there like me alright moving on let's go
ahead and move on to this guy I feel
like this is the next in line this is
the tarte color real Amazonian clay
blush palette so this is what I have
been pairing together with you but wild
I've been liking it a little more just
because I love the shade selection in
here this thing completely fell off
which I'm kind of bummed about because
now the product is going to seep into
each other but over here you can see you
have some of these cool tone shades on
blushes and then you have a nice cool
toned highlight and then over here you
have the warm toned highlights and the
warm toned blushes so what I have really
been focusing on this week is the shaded
deco which is this one right here a
really really nice kind of warm hot
coral shade that is what it looks like
there is the shaded deco I also have
been using the shades surreal quite a
bit and surreal is more of like a cool
toned pink shade and I don't know what
it is these warmer toned ones really
have a nice brightening effect on fair
skin and then also the shade concept
which is the one I'm wearing today and
that's a little more of a neutral shade
so these are the three shades I've
really been rocking out this week
absolutely absolutely love them I'll
show you guys at the end which brush I
have been using to apply them but yeah
really really nice palette right here I
love this formula this is the true
Amazonian clay 12-hour formula so it's
super super good and if they still have
this available I would go ahead and
snatch it up alright next we do have the
two foundations I have been loving this
week and I've actually been pairing
these together so one of them is a true
match foundation it's actually a BB
cream but it has I would say the
coverage of a medium coverage foundation
so this is the covergirl clean matte BB
cream in the shade of 510 affair now I
am self tanned this whole entire week I
have been well not the whole entire week
but mostly those are week
have been self-tan I have two layers of
my Jerkins fair / light mousse on that's
the one that I like to use I bought like
six bottles of that last summer so I
have a lot of that left so that is what
I have on this is still too dark for me
even with two layers of self-tanner so
what I have been doing is mixing it
together with more of a glowy foundation
that is a little too light for me right
now this is the L'Oreal infallible Pro
glow foundation in the shade 2:01
classic ivory so this is a little too
light this is a little too dark mix them
together got a beautiful beautiful Demi
matte finish on my skin because this is
completely matte this is completely
glowy and it was the perfect shade match
that's what I have on my skin today it
looks so like goof proof and beautiful I
don't know what it is it just looks
amazing on the skin I feel like this
gives the coverage this gives a little
bit of like a skin quality so if you do
have the two of these I would highly
recommend going ahead and mixing them
together seeing if you like that
coverage I have been applying them with
a damp sponge really been enjoying that
alright we are going down to second
place what is in second place this week
well my sol de janeiro products are so
here are my sol de janeiro products
these were sent to me for PR to see you
guys know this one was sent to me for PR
from octa lee as well as the sol de
janeiro brand a couple of months ago I
talked about it for you guys it is the
Brazilian bum bum or boom-boom cream oh
the smell is literally orgasmic this is
amazing um I really want to go ahead and
pick up the body spray that they
released now I do not notice any sort of
firming or anti cellulite properties
with this I have a lot of cellulite on
my ass and this does literally nothing
for it but it smells amazing
it does have a little bit of a sheen to
it if you are not a fan of a little bit
of a sheen this does give that I brought
this when we were in Hawaii and I just
love the way like I looked on the beach
with like my bikini because it just made
me feel like it was kind of giving an
illusion of like more firmer looking
skin with the sheen so I really do enjoy
that and then recently they did send me
this little guy right here this is the
acai body power cream now this does not
snow that it does not smell nearly as
good you guys it really is a very
perfumey scent and it's a little on the
sour side so if you don't like that if
you're expecting something like this
this is a nice warm scent this one is a
little more sour but you know what this
is still beautiful it does give the
slightest amount of a pink sheen yes you
heard that right and you know
I'm a fair complected girl and I do have
a cool undertone so that is something
that I am living for it gives like the
slightest amount of like this pink
iridescent on your skin it looks
beautiful on my skin personally and then
on top of that this really makes my skin
feel nice and smooth I wouldn't say it
feels like super hydrated and that's
like greasy or anything like that but it
just makes you feel super soft and
smooth again I don't notice any sort of
difference with cellulite on my ass on
but I really do like these creams and I
would purchase these with my own money
and it does still smell good just not as
good as the boom boom crepe and then
they also did send me the Brazilian kiss
at Kapoor Paco lip butter I don't know
how to say that um this is beautiful I
really do like it the only complaint
with this is the fact that it's freaking
huge as you guys can see it's literally
the size of I would say a glue stick
um smells really good again it has a
really nice warm scent kind of similar
to this but it's not the same and I like
it for during the day just to touch up
really quickly it's nice for when I'm
practicing my flute because it doesn't
rub off on my head joint but I also like
it at nighttime the only issue with this
is the fact that it really really is so
big so like when you're putting it on
your lips you can see this is like
literally both of my lips combined the
sides of it so if you have really big
lips I'm sure this will work for you
during the daytime but for me like when
I'm wearing makeup it tends to rub off
my makeup so I don't really know about
that I know it's extremely pricey as
well literally is like $18 which i think
is kind of expensive for something like
this but it still smells really really
good all of these products smell really
good in my opinion and I have been
enjoying all of them layered together
I've been smelling I've been smelling
something awesome alright and lastly you
guys number one number one place had
been at my wedding while to powder a
brush I am obsessed with this I have
obsessed with this you guys this is what
it looks like
and when you get it it does not look
like this it's kind of like this and it
looks like it doesn't have like a lot of
densely packed bristles or anything like
that it's really really flimsy you have
to wash this you have to wash it and
then you have to kind of go like this to
kind of spread out the bristles but I
swear to you it's amazing I used it for
applying powder I used it for applying
blush I use it for applying absolutely
everything on my face I want like ten of
these I did pick up the foundation
brushes well not as impressed with the
foundation brush to be completely honest
that I am in love with this so anyway
guys that is it for Emma face and holy
grails weekly countdown I hope you
enjoyed this new style of fails and
rales I hope you enjoyed this video
thank you so much for joining me and I
will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
