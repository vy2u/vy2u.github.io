channel welcome back to my BIOS and
Hannah Rails where I share with you guys
the products I have been loving this
week and of course the products I have
not been loving as you can probably tell
from the thumbnail it was not a very
good week for me as far as makeup is
concerned or at least any products that
I chose for shop my stash there were a
lot of products that I didn't really end
up loving some of them are just personal
preference like hey I don't really like
the style of that so it's a feel for me
and others just did not go well together
so we're going to go ahead and start
with the fields and then work our way
down a countdown style into the best
products of the week so the first two
that did not work for me this week were
a pairing they are two foundations the
first is the Neutrogena Healthy Skin
liquid makeup in the shade 10 classic
ivory paired together with the chart's
confidence creamy powder foundation in
the shade fair neutral now I did end up
painting a little bit of baby pan on it
this particular product this week which
i think is awesome but unfortunately
these really do not look good together
now these look beautiful separately so
I'm not trying to say that they're bad
foundations because I actually really
love the finish of this and I love the
way that this looks when I buff it into
the skin alone but paired together there
was just something there that was not
working it's like the ingredients we're
not mixing well together I noticed I was
getting extremely extremely oily in my
t-zone and then I was also getting the
you know that area where it starts to
like break up so you were getting like a
little bit of cakiness things were
starting to like fall into fine lines
and wrinkles it was overall just a very
unflattering look and I didn't really
realize that it was happening until I
actually had a show this week and I came
home from the show and I was like holy
 look at my face so unfortunately
those two just did not work for me this
week they were definitely a fail also I
have two little caviar eye sticks here
umm the first one is from Laura Mercier
it is the rose gold caviar eye stick and
then here we have the Bobbi Brown
long-wear cream shadow stick in the
shade shadow now this one wasn't
necessarily a huge fail but this ended
up being a really big fail for me this
week now I understand that these are
cream shadows so I'm not trying to say
that they don't work as cream shadows
because I think as cream shadows they're
pretty darn good I noticed that this
definitely stays put a lot longer on the
lid and on the lower lash line or on the
waterline then this one does this one
has a little more of like a silicone II
sort of slip to it but unfortunately
this ended up giving me a huge amount of
eye irritation I actually woke up one
morning after wearing this on the
waterline which again I understand it's
a cream eyeshadow but I bore it on the
waterline and I woke up with almost like
a bloodshot eye this week so this was
just something that did not go very well
for me and like I said on the eyelid
it's okay but I ended up looking a
little chunky I felt like it was one of
those things where usually with a cream
eyeshadow if you are gonna wear it on
the lid it should be able to dry down
pretty darn it quickly or frequently
fast and I feel like that does work with
the Bobbi Brown but with this one you
can kind of move it around a little bit
and I started to get a little bit of
creasing and clumpiness on the eyelid so
overall although I really liked this the
first two days I wore it unfortunately
ended up being a fail and then here we
have like I said the Bobbi Brown along
aware cream eyeshadow stick in the shade
shadow the only reason I don't really
like this is because unfortunately when
I did wear it on my eyes I would really
have to pull and tug to get this off at
night it is so hard to get off
and I know that that's a good thing but
it's also a bad thing I am gonna go
ahead and declutter out of my collection
I felt like I was ripping my eyelashes
off this week when I was using it so
yeah that was also a little bit of a
fail alright and then we do have two
other products that were a failed first
is the Lancome what is this called base
mascara I do not feel like this does
anything for my lashes now it's
basically supposed to prime your lashes
so that when you go in with your mascara
it looks a little more thicker and
longer I paired this with three
different mascaras now I don't notice
any sort of difference the best lash
primer I've ever tried is the urban
decay subversion that is the one that I
would recommend to you guys this one
does absolutely nothing and then this
guy right here this is very much
personal preference it was a fail for me
because I don't like the way it makes my
lashes look now a lot of you absolutely
loved the way that my lashes look this
week it is the Diorshow mascara I'm
today I'm wearing the Urban Decay
perversion just because I feel like you
know it gives me a little bit of
different definition but I also gives me
that fluttery look this only gives me
the fluttery look I'm not into it I also
found that a flake throughout the day
has a very interesting smell to it it
smells a little sweet but I did end up
getting this in my eye as well this week
it was kind of a hard week for me as far
as makeup is concerned I ended up
getting this in my eye and it stung so
bad like it was it was incredible I was
I was horrible it was absolutely
incredible how much this stuff so
unfortunately this is just not really my
style
if you do like be very very
natural-looking alas you probably would
like it but I guess I'll just put that
into the in-between kind of category
because again not saying it's a bad
product it's just not my style all right
let's go ahead and get into the products
that we're actually good this week the
first two are the Lancome a blush
subtalar palette now I don't love
everything in these palettes I'm not a
big fan of these highlights over here I
feel like they're really really like
barely there kind of highlights but the
blushes in here are gorgeous so this
first one is called rose elixir I'm
sorry rose a flush and it's a really
really beautiful rosy shade with a
little bit of a silvery iridescent to it
so that is what it looks like on the
skin super super beautiful I got this
after glam Life guru or Tati here on
YouTube recommended it and then I loved
it so much that I did end up picking up
the shade and nectar lace and this one
is my all-time favorite as you can see
really really nice orangie beautiful
kind of peachy color going on here and
these are some of the nicest like
palettes I've ever found from Lancome
Lancome is one of those brands where
they are either a hit or a miss for me
there is no in-between with their
products for some reason but these are
really beautiful so I have been enjoying
them quite a bit this week I also do
have a bath product that I have been
loving I've been sharing this on insta
stories as well as on my snapchat it is
the bath and Bodyworks aromatherapy
stress relief stress relief eucalyptus
spearmint luxury bath so it does say
eucalyptus essential oil will clear your
mind while spearmint essential oil
uplifts I love the scent of this I love
the bubbles that it makes really really
nice luxurious soft bubbles and on top
of that yes I feel calmer already on top
of that I really enjoy the fact that
this actually does moisturize my skin
some of these other you know bubble
baths from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works that are
super super fragrance I feel like they
don't have those essential oils in there
they're not as nice during this time of
year where maybe your skin is getting
it's still like a little dry from winter
time this one on the other hand is
really really good I'm still dealing
with dry patches like on my elbows on my
knees on my legs but the rest of my body
is starting to get a little oily but I
really really have been enjoying this
I've been talking about it all week on
snapchat and then here we do have the it
cosmetics naturally pretty eyeshadow
palette so I really have been enjoying
this this week the only thing that I
will say is that these are almost too
soft you guys like to blendable what I
mean by that is that the colors are so
similar and close to each other that
when you get them on the eye it's
Leigha not going to be one of those
pallets where you can differentiate like
which color is where I do have three of
these colors on today and you probably
can't even tell so the first one I do
have on is sheer joy which is that shade
right there I also have warmth in my
crease and then I did take a little bit
of this one which is my all-time
favorite shade which is called soulful
and I just have those on my eyes and
again like I said you probably can't
tell where I place the colors it's just
one of those palettes where it does kind
of start to muddy together but I feel
like if you love everyday natural looks
and you really don't want to spend a lot
of time blending your eyeshadows this is
actually a really fantastic palette so
I'm going to be keeping it in my
collection I just wanted to say I know
that people are really taken by the
colors in here but just know that once
you get them on the eyes it is really
really hard to get them to stand out on
their own like oh there's that shade
there's that shade they just kind of
start to money together but you know
what sometimes that's a really pretty
look and I do still enjoy it so that is
something that I have been liking this
week I also have been loving all loving
loving loving bite arched artist contour
palette I told you guys that this was
something that will got lost in my
collection basically it got trapped
underneath my Alex series 9 drawer and I
recently found it and I'm in love it is
such a good palette from charge like I
said last time in my shop my stash video
of course is a Tarte palette so there is
one falen here that little middle shade
right there is so useless and stupid I
don't like it at all however the rest of
them are creamy buttery beautiful on the
scanner I am wearing the blush today
which i think is stunning it's a really
really nice kind of rosy hue with a bit
of like a cool undertone I really do
like the corrector shade underneath my
eyes I don't apply too much just because
it is very yellow the cream shade is
beautiful and then that contour shade is
really really nice as well so this is a
good quality palette from ATAR do you
guys know that I've been on tarts ass
lately I've been on two-faced ass lately
but you know what this is actually a
good palette again these are more like
old school palettes you know these
aren't the stuff that they're releasing
currently I feel like the that they
are releasing currently is not as good
but some of their old school stuff is
really nice so really been enjoying that
and it does smell like chocolate next we
do have a little skincare pairing here
so we have the chart rainforest of the
sea deep dive cleansing and gel and then
we do have my Luna 4 Rayo mini these go
together really really nicely now I
noticed sometimes in the morning if I
use my loot Luna Froyo mini
with like a cleanser that has like a lot
of cleansing properties to it it strips
my skin and I feel really tight and
itchy and my skin just doesn't feel
right so what I've been doing is pairing
it together with this this does have I
believe a little bit of markussi oil
infused in there I never feel like it
strips my skin the two together are
really nice they get very sudsy and very
very foamy on the face I showed this on
snapchat as well you can see it just
starts foaming up all over the place
it's got a really nice Pleasant citrus
smell to it and I love the cleanse that
it gives me I never feel like my skin is
stripped after using both of these and I
can go for the full cycle on this and I
don't have any sort of issues so really
been loving that skin care pairing this
week and the number 2 spot you guys is
going to my beautiful beautiful barely
there kind of highlights so the first
one is the Clinique uh plating powder in
the shade zero one nude glow this is
what I have on today is kind of like a
blush topper I have it on my cheekbones
I have it here on my forehead I haven't
done the bridge of my nose I pretty much
have this everywhere it's a beautiful
beautiful subtle kind of highlight I'm
not going to swatch them for you guys
because it's barely there like I said
but this is what it looks like up close
and it is just absolutely stunning you
can see there's not the glitter infused
in here when you look at in the pan you
can see little bits of glitter it does
not transfer on to the skin it's one of
those products that's not full pigment
so you really can use it like it's an
all-over powder even if you want to it
reminds me a lot of those hourglass
ambient lighting powder so I've been
loving that this week and then also the
Josie Maran Argan enlightenment
aluminized veil god these have been my
favorite makeup products of the week
again a very beautiful very very subtle
this one leans a little more warm toned
the Clinique one is definitely a little
more neutral toned not too warm and not
too pink and I just really have been
enjoying the out of these and
finally guys the number one spot is
going to a product that a lot of you
recommended to me so this is the
Thayer's witch hazel aloe vera formula
alcohol-free toner in the rose petal
scent I am loving this it reminds me of
one of my all-time favorite toners which
I no longer repurchase because they do
test on animals it's from L'Oreal it's
called the Hydra Fresh toner I always
felt like that's just like balanced out
and neutralized my skin just helped it
you know sometimes I feel like you can
use toners that are super super strong
and harsh or ones that don't really do
anything and the point of a toner is
just to even out and balance the skin
like the pH level I feel like this does
that perfectly for me so it doesn't have
no
all your paraben free satellite free
gluten free under stilled witch hazels
which is supposed to be the best it does
have rosewater it cleanses it tones they
also have a lavender version which is
geared more towards those of you who do
have dry skin or normal skin but this is
a beautiful for combination skin like I
said I feel like it just kind of evens
out my skin it feels really good I feel
like it just kind of balances out the
skin so even if I do go in with a really
really harsh cleanser say I use
something else with like the luna pareo
mini and I feel really tight you know I
can go in with this and then it will
kind of moisturize or if I go in with a
cleanser that really doesn't take off
the kind of grime like when I use this
alone sometimes I do notice it leaves a
little too much behind I can go in with
this and it will also go ahead and
remove that build-up so it's just like
the perfect product perfect toner you
did get 12 fluid ounces at Target for
like $9.99 they are cruelty free would
highly recommend thank you so much to
everybody who told me to pick this up so
anyway guys those are my fails and holy
grails for the week definitely let me
know what yours are down below and I
will see you guys tomorrow for a video
all about brands that excite me so I'll
see you then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
