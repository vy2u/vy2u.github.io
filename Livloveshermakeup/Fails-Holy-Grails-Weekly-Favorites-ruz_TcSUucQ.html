thank you so much for joining me i am
here doing my first sales and holy
grails video this is basically just
weekly favorites I decided to rename and
kind of revamp this series because I was
thinking about how I really just call it
weekly favorites and go one two three
four five six and think about it in like
four years it's going to be like weekly
favorites number 1248 and I'm thinking
that it just it's just not gonna look
very pretty it's not a very cute little
name especially when I've been numbering
it like that and on top of that I
thought you know I usually reserve my
weekly favorites for products that i
really enjoy cuz they're my weekly
favorites but i know that you guys do
enjoy when I talk about products that
didn't work for me and there is usually
one or two products each week when I
shot my stash and I go ahead and I
choose out my products for the week
there usually is something that doesn't
go well with you know it doesn't play
well with the other products that I'm
using that week or something that just
isn't working for me general right now
so I am just I thought it would be nice
to do this little fails and holy grails
that way I can also let you guys know
about products that haven't been working
out for me or products that didn't work
for me that week so let's just get right
into it I'm going to start with the sale
there is only one thank goodness and it
is a big fail this is the l'oreal
everpure selfie free repair remedy mask
you guys may have seen me all this about
a week ago and I remember my first
impression on it I opened it up and he
smelled it and I literally was like oh
my god and you could tell like my
expression on camera it was really
disgusted this smells like a very very
strong like men's cologne after shave
shaving cream whatever it's too strong
you guys it's just too strong on top of
that the consistency of it and you guys
can tell I really tried to use it this
week I really really did i went up i
probably used half at this I just can't
use it it's just too much it's too much
for me the smell is too much and that
says a lot I am somebody who loves
strong sense this is too much it's too
strong and it actually feels like a
shave cream as well so I feel like I'm
putting like shave cream in my hair it's
a very strange consistency as well and I
think that I really did anything
extravagant or extraordinary from my
hair so overall this was my fail for the
week I will continue to try and use it
it's not something that I'm gonna go and
throw away I will be doing a video next
Friday yes next friday on absolute
big-time fails that i will be throwing
the products away i have makeup hair
care skin care i'll be talking about
those on friday but this is one of those
kind of things where it's like yes it
was a fail but not to the point that i'm
going to throw it away i will try and
use it but I mean it's definitely not my
favorite alright so let's get into my
holy grails for the week my first is my
fragrance duo loving this this week my
PS i love you fragrance mist from Bath
and Body Works I've been pairing this
with the coach what is the Scud they
coach friscia blossom I always forget i
have so many of these this is the free
show blossom super cute packaging this
is really nice very very floral e it's a
little overpowering if you don't like
super strong sense you probably won't
like this but it pairs beautifully with
the PS i love you the PS i love you is
such a wonderful fragrance from bath and
body works very very kind of classy and
elegant and just not their typical like
go to sweet kind of things so i really
have been enjoying that fragrance duo my
second favorite here's my little beauty
blender all wrapped up he's dirty so i
don't want to touch him I used him today
um put my dating blender and normally
you guys know I reached for my Real
Techniques sponge before my Beauty
Blender I have been wearing a foundation
let me show you guys the foundation that
I've been loving this is the covergirl
trublend liquid makeup in the shade I
Brie this is a really beautiful
foundation it's got very very nice sheer
like skin like sort of coverage and I
find when I apply it with a damp Beauty
Blender it just gives a beautiful look
to my skin it really looks like skin up
close I'm not Richard what it looks like
on camera but up close if I hold a
mirror up and like wow that looks like
skin not like I'm wearing makeup it's a
beautiful beautiful finish on the
foundation but it looks so beautiful
applied with the Beauty Blender and I
personally in my own opinion i think
that the Real Techniques sponge is a
little denser than the Beauty Blender
and I feel like it gives more coverage
but I really liked that the Beauty
Blender just kind of kept to this
foundation looking very very sheer on my
skin my thought
really beautiful so I love that too well
I also would you guys like to see a
video I was thinking about doing a video
on products that nobody talks about that
are like that I really really enjoy how
would I how would I like what would I
call bad what does it call you know it's
like drugstore gems are not like
drugstore gems but you know what i mean
i think i saw emilynoel83 do a video
like that products nobody talks about
that's what I'm trying to say products
nobody talks about I have a lot from the
drugstore that I feel like nobody talks
about and this is definitely one of them
the foundation is fantastic and I feel
like nobody talks about these um but
yeah I am quite a few from the drugstore
and also high-end that I feel like are
so worth the hype yet nobody talks about
them and there is no hype about them so
let me know if you guys would like to
see a video on that alright my next holy
grail for the week has been this caress
passionate spell passion fruit and fiery
orange body wash oh my god this smells
so good I got this because L is for
living here on YouTube al she talks
about this a lot it's like one of her
favorites I've seen it a lot more
empties videos and our favorites and I
finally picked it up I had never had a
body wash from chris but it's really
nice it doesn't dry out your skin it
just cleans you really really well it's
got a nice thick formula very very cheap
and cheerful and this smells amazing it
is a very very kind of it's definitely
got like vanilla or something in there
to be seductive sent in my opinion so I
really really have been loving that as
far as washing my face at night I've
been loving the shea Tara organics
rosehips black soap facial wash I have
been using these little first day beauty
facial radiance pads at night these have
glycolic acid in them and I would really
enjoy those as well but I don't want to
mix glycolic acid with like benzoyl
peroxide or salicylic acid really just
because my skin has been a little more
sensitive this week so I thought this
was a nice way to kind of clear out my
pores without drying them out so this is
really nice it is really good if you
have like I would say if you want
anti-aging properties but you still get
breakouts this is really fantastic
african black soap is great for it says
the anti acne anti-aging wonder soap so
it's really really good for that it does
have a very natural scent it doesn't
really smell very good at the little
musky but honestly just a great great
great facial wash very very like deep
cleaning obviously say
who cleans yes you can say that I can
speak it deeply cleans my skin so
awkward alright so I should talk about
these magazines of alpha been a Holy
Grail the first day beauty facial
radiance pad these exfoliate tone and
brighten one of these pads all over my
face at night and on my neck that is all
I've been doing for my skincare at night
and normally i'm one of those people I
do like multiple multiple things at once
but when my skin is very very sensitive
I don't like to layer products just
because it makes it even more sensitive
so I've been having a sensitive skin
week and these have been perfect for my
skin at night I'm absolutely love them
really really nice they sink in really
quickly they're just little tiny pens
that you put all over all right as far
as shampooing goes this week I've been
loving my oh gx this is the renewing our
vows oil of Morocco's shampoo mixed with
their argan oil of Morocco miracle in
shower oil so I've been mixing the two
of these together I would say a little
squeeze of this was like you know to
squeezes of this and I feel like this
really really really um Clayton's my
hair but I also Lisa nice and silky and
moisturize so I've really been enjoying
this I feel like you either love or hate
the oh gx brand my hair personally loves
it so I get a lot of products from them
and this in shower body oil is really
cool you can use this on your body you
can use it in your hair you can use it
on you know your skin you could probably
use it on your eyelashes if you wanted
to like it is very very gentle and just
a very very moisturizing and repairing
so love it alright so the next thing
I've been loving before i put on my lip
color in the morning is the strawberries
and cream lip smacker I've yet another
product that I feel like nobody talks
about but that are so so good lip
smackers are really good I feel like
these are put off as one of those
products it's like very very childish
but honestly these really moisturize
well and it smelled amazing the
strawberries and cream sent open guys
still good ass smells like cake just
kind of went to eat it okay but it's
really really good I've been loving that
on my eyes this week all week I've been
wearing my too faced natural matte
eyeshadow palette the video before this
one I did like a little tutorial on this
I just the way the same kind of look all
week it's mostly been heaven all over a
little bit of lace Teddy in my
strapless in my crease chocolate cookie
on the outer be and then honey butter on
my lid love it it's so amazing it's very
versatile and I just I just love it's a
really fantastic little matte palette
all right as far as lip color goes this
week I've been using this Sephora the
beauty of giving back face palette so
this has been my face palette for blush
bronzer and lip product this week so
these are cream blushes but I've been
wearing these on my lips this week a lot
of people have been asking me what I've
been wearing on my lips so today I'm
wearing this deeper darker shade down
here but these are so beautiful I'm not
a huge fan of like cream blushes so I
didn't wear these on my face this week
however I did wear them on my lips and I
thought that the color on all of them
was just really really beautiful and
they did like dry very very match so I
did go ahead and talk them with these
Stila lip blazes in the shade glamour or
glory and glory is a nice deep purple
that's the one I have on today and then
glamour is the kind of reddish pinky
color and I think that they really
taught nicely on top of those cream
blushes how many times can I say top top
tip top but really they looked really
good on top of those and I felt like
these were very kind of drying and Matt
but then the Stila lip like to stay very
very like I don't want to say moist cuz
they're kind of tacky and sticky but
they stay very glossy on the lips though
the combination was nice I'm wearing
glory and that shade today and then the
other day I was wearing a really really
light pink I was wearing that one and
glamour so loving that as far as lip
products go this week that was a lot of
fun to play with I've so many of the
Stila lip places that I really don't use
them a lot I don't find that they wear
really nicely by themselves but when you
combine them there's a little fluff what
was that I thought that was a bug there
was like a little piece of fluff flying
around anyway oh my god there it is what
is that oh geez there's fluff flying
everywhere what's happening alright i'm
sorry i love my train of thought
over they think oh yeah the Stila lip
played this thing we're really really
nicely on top of other products but by
themselves I think they're a little
tacky and they start to go outside the
lip line so I don't like that but anyway
let's talk about as far as bronzing and
blushes go these this little face
palette here has like that ombre bronzer
here which is nice it's very very
shimmery but I've been loving the ombre
blush that's what I'm wearing today is
that gorgeous peachy shade they also
have another blush here and one here in
this palette that are both really really
beautiful so this is a fantastic
fantastic little palette um I'm just not
I don't know I'm kind of scared to use
those creamy blush shades because they
are so creamy I feel like they're kind
of oily and I'm worried that I'm going
to turn oily if I try them out but maybe
I could pair them with the powder shades
I don't know I might try that but anyway
that is the Sephora the beauty of giving
back face palette I've been loving that
this week all right another products
that has been such a holy grail this is
like a ho my god I'm loving this my
friend and Mellie recently did like a
hall and she was talking about all these
products from the drugstore she buys a
lot of new leg wet'n'wild products and
she was talking about this wet'n'wild
photo focused setting spray and she was
saying it's amazing it's very comparable
to the Urban Decay so of course I had to
pick it up I totally trust her
recommendation she knows so much about
makeup and I love this it is so good you
do only get 1.5 to fluid ounces of
product in here but it's amazing it
squirts out a lot at once so instead of
just spraying it directly on my face
that kind of spray it in the air and
then go like this so I'll do five sprays
of this it literally makes my makeup
lasts all day it will look like at the
end of the day when I look in the mirror
it looks like i just applied my makeup
that it's that good so it really really
makes my foundation where along longer I
don't have to powder or touch up as much
especially in my t-zone I am combo skin
so you would think i would have to touch
off all the time but I hurry didn't have
to it was amazing so I love this and
also it smells really good mullet can be
so that is definitely a holy grail for
the week all right masking this week
loving my au lait henriksen truth sugar
glow polishing mask I recently reviewed
this is amazing it's got honey in it it
has exfoliating smells so good exfoliate
particles in it smells like an orange
creamsicle it just
fully aids it brightens your skin it's
really really fantastic so that has been
my go-to mask for I crane in the morning
I've been loving this Olay Total Effects
CC eye brightening cream I've talked
about this a lot before it's really
really nice it's not super moisturizing
or humectants but what I like about it
is that i had a peach undertone so it
helps cancel out any blue tones that you
may have in the morning underneath your
eye area so i really really love that
and also my goodness i talked about this
into my serum video yesterday my skin
care 101 serum video the bare minerals
skin longevity vital power infusion girl
oh my god this is amazing i'm loving
this stuff it is so so liquidy like when
you first pump it out your legos like
gross it like literally runs all the way
down your arm but it is so nice because
you put it on your face and you can tell
there's moisture in there and that it's
doing something because I've end of the
week you can see a difference in your
skin but it sinks in so quickly you just
rub it in and then it doesn't even feel
like there's anything on your face it's
amazing i think all skin types could use
this loving it i already put a full-size
on my love's list at sephora to pick up
all right as far as priming goes this
week i've been loving my lorac behind
the scenes I primer and this one is
older and I'm telling you the older the
better because it was really really
tacky and sticky and I feel like my
eyeshadows have been lasting and like
not creasing as much this week so I've
been loving that and then if you've got
GlossyBox for this week check out this
week this month check out the a meet a
makeup diamond heart based primer the
illuminating one that we got in our box
this is amazing it's a soft-focus primer
it's really gorgeous it doesn't have any
silicone or anything like that in it it
really just kind of gives a soft focus
effect to your skin it really has like a
peachy tone to it so kind of color
corrects a little bit it's amazing i
love it on my nails this week loving
this champagne color this is called
champagne problems from trust fund
beauty I also got this in I think my
glossybox or some sort of subscription
box it's amazing it's a beautiful color
it goes on opaque in one coat loving it
absolutely for eyelashes or just for
mascara eyelash
don't wear eyelashes for a mascara I've
been loving my benefit they're real
mascara this is nice and volumizing it's
kind of like a three-in-one actually
it's fantastic and then I've been going
in with my telescopic carbon black from
l'oreal on top just to add some extra
length so loving that as far as lip
balms go at night my Christian Dior
creme de rose lip balm and I am somebody
who has a lot of lip balms and when I
hit pan on something like this that
should say a lot okay this is coming
from a flute player who is constantly
obsessed with moisturizing her lips it
just smells so good I think it's also
the smell that gets me I love anything
rose but this really is so so
moisturizing on the lips so highly
recommend love it let's see here did I
mention the josie maran pure argan milk
that's what I've been wearing as my
moisturizer in the morning I love it
it's a little less oily than like for
actual oils like her argan oil light or
just for regular formula of argan oil it
still has that oil in there so if you
have oily skin you probably won't like
this but you have combo skin and dry
skin you will it's really really lovely
and it does sink in a little quicker
than the oils I've been loving my lasse
tab this is the delightful Rose hand
cream again anything Rose I'm obsessed
with and this is really nice it has shea
butter in it and then the last two
things are the hourglass ambient strobe
lighting powder in brilliant I reviewed
these I love this this is a very very
beautiful subtle highlight and you
really can build it up quite a lot but
I've been wearing it quite lightly on my
cheeks this week and I don't even know
if it picks up on camera but it's just
beautiful in person it really just looks
like soft focus pretty gorgeousness on
your cheeks I really love it so this has
definitely definitely been my go-to
highlights and then the last thing I've
been loving this week has been something
that I mentioned all the time in weekly
favorites this is the Laura Geller icare
waterproof eyeliner I Brighton are in
like that banana shade it's amazing it
really opens your eyes up you just put
it on your wedding it just gives a
really open eye defect I absolutely love
it so then is it guys those were my
fails and holy grails for the week I
hope you guys enjoy this new little I
mean it's not even a new series I've
just rebranded
the weekly favorites name but anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I will
