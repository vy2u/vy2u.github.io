welcome back to miles and halle grails
where i share with you guys the products
i have been loving this week and they
products that i have been hating as
always we are going to go ahead and
start with the fails the first fail is
from josie maran this is the Nirvana
hydrating treatment mess so I've been
using this for maybe about two and a
half weeks now and I'm just not that
impressed I feel like I have had a
really big batch of bad luck as far as
like facial myths are concerned lately I
really should just stick with the ones
that I know work for my skin like the
Mario Badescu rose water spray and
outside though surely crows water
balancing miss those kind of items but I
wanted to try this out and honestly I
just don't like it I don't like the
sprayer it's kind of cool because you
can hold your finger down and it will
give like and even miss all over your
face but at the same time I just feel
like it didn't really put enough product
onto my skin like I would be like okay
like mon let's do this and also it had
kind of a strange smell I had kind of a
strange taste I don't know how about in
my mouth but it did and yeah i just
don't really notice a difference with it
so this is definitely the first fail
definitely the first item that really
disappointed me this week the next item
that really disappointed me this week
that i'm just gonna toss is this blotter
razzi sponge from Beauty Blender this
does nothing it does nothing I'm not
gonna go any further I'm just gonna say
it does nothing okay so don't get it
alright moving on the next item that was
a feel this week is the locket setting
powder in the translucent version from
kat von d if you saw yesterday's are one
of yesterday's videos which was look of
the week you know that i really only
like to use this underneath the eyes it
is like a powder that you can use all
over your face however this stuff gets
soaked a key so so so quickly like
literally less is more with this product
so for all over the face this is
definitely a fail but when it comes to
actually putting it underneath your eyes
to set in your concealer I think it's
relatively good all right and then the
last feel for the week is from ample I
ample I mascara note the brand is called
new lifestyle company I don't even know
where that is it's made in the USA there
in Phoenix Arizona I don't know I think
I got this in my box a charm it's
supposed to be an amplifying mascara
syrah this just like makes my eyelashes
look so strange and literally like I'll
put a coat of it on and it will just put
like all of them into a clump so that it
literally looks like I have to
it's the strangest thing normally a leg
clumpy lashes but not like to lash
clumps okay I like different kind of
little clump things going on but if it
just looks like i have two lashes that's
like pointless and very strange so i
will be going ahead and decluttering
this for sure and also it was just such
a strange formulation very very oily and
very very wet and kind of just
disgusting a goofy so I would not
repurchase that obviously alright let's
go ahead and get into the Holy Grails
the first two items I have are actually
food related so the first one is from
international delight this is the
pumpkin pie spice creamer this is what
it looks like you guys have probably
seen this at your grocery store it's
amazing it smells so good it tastes so
good and I just dump this in my coffee I
go hardcore I go ham with it I really
just dump a lot of this in my copy in
the morning you guys know I loved the
starbucks k-cup and the verandah blend
which is like they're blonde roast I
really like that very very nice and
mellow but this week i've also been
trying their what's it called breakfast
blend and i like it it's pretty darn
good alright and then the second food
item i have been loving is this Honey
Crisp inspired granola this is basically
just granola with cinnamon and honey and
also pieces of dried honeycrisp apple in
it it tastes amazing I'm really getting
into the fall season right now so very
very excited to have this and also I
think we've gone through two or three
bags that this already in the past like
week and a half so Tom likes to eat this
just like handfuls of it dry and then I
like to put it in my almond milk so and
that is the second food-related favorite
moving on the next item I have been
loving this week are these sephora green
tea exfoliating wipes so i picked up
every single one of these they have like
a rose one they have like a yuzu one
they have a charcoal all this kind of
stuff i really like these ones i think
the coconut water yeah the coconut water
ones are just ok i love the rose ones
and then i need to try the other ones
out but these are actually really nice
so they have one side that's super super
textured and honestly that side is just
a little too abrasive I don't like to
rub it on my face however the other side
is really really nice and I just feel
like these really do mattify my skin
I've been using them to actually cleanse
my skin in the morning so I use these
and then I'll go in with my skincare in
the morning and they're mattifying and
anti blemish I don't know about anti
blemish I
and having my period this week so I have
been breaking out but I noticed that
these do mattify me so if you are
looking for some cleansing wipes that
maybe you want to like bring to the gym
with you or something like that to kind
of um you know get rid of the oils on
your skin those are awesome alright i
also have been loving my Fremen feeling
beautiful charcoal and black sugar
polishing mask this is for all skin
types and it says dual action purifying
mask this stuff is awesome it's
basically just activated charcoal on
your face so what you do is you take
like a glop of it and it smells quite
good it smells kind of perfume me yeah
it smells kind of perfume you which is
kind of strange for a product like this
but that's okay you get a lot of product
you hear six fluid ounces and you put it
on to the palm of your hand you kind of
rub it together and then you put it
directly onto your skin you can't really
like evenly coat your whole face it's
kind of hard to describe this explain
extreme it's kind of hard to explain
like it starts to kind of fall off your
face a little bit because it is so
filled with exfoliating particles
however what I will say is that when you
wash this off your face it gives you
such a baby soft skin very very similar
to the glam glow youth but in my opinion
so if you do want something that gives
you the exfoliation that the glam glow
youth mud does I feel like this does
really really nicely and also the
charcoal in there is really good for
detoxifying your pores alright moving on
I have been enjoying my stila trust in
love gift set for my eye shadow this
week this was a 2015 holiday palette it
came with a sila lip glaze a mascara and
then all of these eyeshadows up here I
think there's like 15 or 20 wait one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven twelve there's 12 not 15 not 20
there's 12 anyway there are some
gorgeous gorgeous shades in here I
really love these satiny textures and
also the max textures or just the
finishes I don't really like the ones
that are like I don't know coated with
glitter in there they're just a little
little ashy and also they're just hard
to blend so i really like these satin
finishes i like the matte finishes
they're very very beautiful and they go
on likely foiled I shadow really been
enjoying that palette this week i also
have been enjoying these two tart
brushes so this is from the tart to
nicole concealer brush set this is the
foundation brush that you're supposed to
use for powder foundation not used it
today so i'm sorry if it's dirty but
you're supposed to use this for powder
foundation however this applies lick
foundation so beautifully like literally
if you want to blend in your liquid
foundation in literally two seconds not
two seconds maybe five seconds maybe
like 20 20 seconds you need this you
literally just go in circular motions
it's so smooth and I talked about it
yesterday in my look at the week video I
was saying how it's really nice because
the product just sits on top of the
bristles it doesn't sink in so you can
apply it to the back of your hand and
then go in and do that so you don't have
to like apply it to your face and then
go in I really really like this it
really applies foundation beautifully
and also the charts air buffer
foundation brush I love this as well
it's just so easy it takes up a lot of
surface area and it basically will pack
on powder or foundation very very
quickly for you so I've been loving
those two items and the next item I have
been loving it's from Bath and Body
Works this is the sweet cinnamon pumpkin
fine fragrance miss you who I can barely
read that it's so tiny this is a fine
fragrance mist in sweet cinnamon pumpkin
it smells amazing just like pumpkins and
cinnamon basically now I'm really funny
I don't actually like this in Wallflower
form I don't like this in cups about a
cake like chef mmm I don't like this in
three with candle forum and then sorry
but I do like it in the spray form so i
don't know i like to wear it as a
fragrance but i don't like my house to
smell like it which makes no sense but
it is what it is going on and the next
item i have been loving is the laura
mercier extra lash sculpting mascara in
the shade black onyx so this is the
mascara that makes my lashes look
absolutely fantastic but when i was
pairing it with that amplifying mascara
serum this week and made them look real
bad but this looks amazing would you
just wear it on its own or you apply it
with like a nice lash primer so i really
really love this you can see the brushes
right up by ali rubber bristol and it
looks like a medieval torture tool
totally love that it gives you nice
spiteri but like thick and defines
lashes so I door that the next two items
I have been enjoying our the glam glow
glow starter mega illuminating
moisturizer paired together with the
marula by john paul selects this is a
hundred percent pure Marilla oil now
this was sent to me for PR so it was
sent to me basically what that means is
they send it to my mailbox I pick it up
I try it out and then I can give my
honest opinions on it so they're not
paying me to talk about this particular
product but
they did send it to me and the reason
I'm talking about it is because I do
like it quite a bit so this is what it
looks like I really like mixing this
together with my moisturizer you guys
know that I do like to combat my oil
with oil so sometimes what I'll do is
I'll go in with a moisturizer and then
I'll take like a full dropper full of
oil and put it on top of my skin before
going in with like my makeup however
this is a very very thick and luxurious
oil very reminiscent of the tarte
maracuja oil so what I like to do is
literally just take about two or three
dropper Foles of this like two or three
drops not drop or Falls have two or
three drops of this and I mix it in with
the dis glam glow glow starter methyl
illuminating moisturizer and I love the
way it looks you guys know i purchased
this particular moisturizer probably
about two or three months ago it smells
so good a smells like bubble gum or like
lemon cake or something but this
particular moisturizer is very very thin
and it doesn't moisturize it it doesn't
voice tries it as well as you would
think it would that's why I'm basically
trying to say it's a very thin
consistency and at least a gorgeous
sheen on the skin however I do like to
go in with an oil or even a thick
moisturizer on top of it during you know
the cooler months so anyway I'm going in
with that oil but like I said I don't
like to put a full dropper full on my
skin because it's a bit too greasy but
if you are looking for a really nice
anti-aging oil that is a good one
alright moving on the next item I have
been loving is from kat von d this is
the locket Kat Von D luck a concealer
creme yes and they shade whiteout so
this is what it looks like this is a
white mixer concealer and what I've been
doing is putting this under my eyes this
week and then I've been going in with
the it cosmetics bye-bye redness cream I
love the way that the two of these mix
together this is obviously lighter than
my skin this is darker so the two of
them mixed together is amazing they
blend out freakishly freakishly well
together and I just really enjoyed this
caring so I've been loving the two of
those i also have been loving my NARS
velvet matte skin tint with
broad-spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen in the
shade at taryn way they 01 this is what
it looks like and I have been using
those tart foundation brushes to buff
this into the skin it looks really
really beautiful you do want to shake it
up really nicely because it does smell
and kind of have the consistency of
sunscreen if you just kind of let it sit
there for a while so definitely shake it
up but it's beautiful it definitely
gives more of like a demi matt
send me Matt appearance to the skin so
if you're expecting something to be if
you're expecting this not something
you're expecting this to be completely
matte on the skin it's not going to do
that but it still is pretty darn Matt
all right I've been loving these two
primers this week this is the Bobby
Brown extra vitamin enriched facespace
this is really nice it smells like lemon
pound cake and I only have the tiniest
tiniest little bit left as you guys can
probably see it's a really good product
I don't think I would purchase a
full-size but I have enjoyed usage I
have been enjoying using it this week
can I talk today tonight it's been a
long day alright so the next item I have
been loving is the put a lid on it
eyelid primer from the bomb this is what
it looks like it's basically just a
really really silicone like primer and I
really like to take it underneath my
eyes as well so this is really nice for
basically priming your underlying as
well as your eyelid so I have been
adoring those i also have been enjoying
my clinique skinny stick Andy shade 03
slim sable this is so tiny and precise
and amazing on the waterline and on
Blake the lower lash line or even just I
don't even know you can put it on your
tight line now I suck at doing my tight
line but I do know how to do my
waterline sometimes so anyway that is
what it looks like a very very nice dark
chocolaty brown color kind of reminds me
of these Smashbox I always sharp out or
always on point eyeliner in the shade
Sumatra I like that all right and then I
have been loving the studio 10 brow lift
perfecting liner I don't like this side
the site is a fail it's like this weird
like yellowy color you're supposed to
put this underneath your brow and it's
super super dry and just a strange color
but the other side is a pretty topi um
pencil and basically I've been filling
in the front of my brows with this so I
have been enjoying that product quite a
bit moving on i also have been adoring a
micro res lip butter glosses you guys I
love these i'm so happy that i picked
this little kit up so basically these
are just really glossy lip butters and
they're very comfortable on the lips if
you guys couldn't tell I've really
started to tell myself only use lip
products that you like and I feel like
these are right up my alley they do come
off a little bit on my flute headjoint
but it's not too bothersome the shades
that I have our pink which is just a
really really nice mid tone pink shade
also peach which is like a bright guava
shade and then
this one is what I'm wearing right now
this one is called natural and I love
this shade this has been my favorite
this week alright moving on I have three
skins care samples to talk to you guys
about so you have been telling me for a
while to look into these sunday riley
brands and i was always just like no I'm
not doing it because i have heard such
shitty things about the way that these
particular products smell but i will say
the scent has not been bothering me
really at all this particular product
may be a little bit but let me just show
you guys what I basically used up so I
dug around in my samples bin and I chose
out three different sunday riley
products the first is the title
brightening enzyme water cream this was
really really beautiful i'm not going to
go and purchase a full size of this
right away but this is a very very
beautiful cream especially for daytime
use and then i did go ahead and find
this little sample of the Martian
mattifying melting water gel toner this
is a really cool product I am on the
fence about it's like as far as buying a
full-size because honestly this is for
very oily to acne prone skin and it is
very very mattifying I don't think that
I need this this time of year because I
am starting to get a little more dry
like my skin is trying to get a little
more dry than oily but this would have
been perfect during the summertime it's
really awesome it basically is just a
green toner gel you can put it onto a
cotton pad or you can put it on with
your fingertips it smells not great like
there's a little bit of like a lemony or
lemongrass sort of scent on top of the
underlying not so great scent but it's
not anything that's super super
bothersome that's one thing that people
always say about sunday riley products
is that they stink i really haven't
noticed it's been that bad so anyway it
doesn't smell amazing but that is what
it looks like really really good for
acne prone skin and you can follow up
with the UFO dry oil and that's one that
i do want to check out but i just think
right now i don't think my skin needs
that so the item that i will be getting
a full size of is definitely this this
is the luna sleeping at night oil it has
retinol and blue tansy in it and i used
up basically a five-day sample tonight
will be my last day to use this level
guys so this is absolutely beautiful and
this is one of those products that I
literally did see results within three
days so i will be going ahead and
purchasing a full size of this i have
tried retinol oils before i do like the
one from peter thomas roth but i noticed
big difference with this particular
product so I'm going to get a full size
of that what I'm going to do is I saw
online there was a set for a hundred
five dollars you get the Luna oil like
half the size of the Luna oil and then
also the good genes which is a lactic
acid treatment you guys have been
telling me the lactic acid treatment is
almost even better than this so what I'm
going to go ahead and do is get that
little duo so that i can use this at
night and then you wait for this to sink
in and then you go in with the lactic
acid treatment on top so like I said I
really have been enjoying these sunday
riley products i don't know if i will
purchase this i don't know if i'll
purchase this yet but i definitely am
going to get the luna and also the what
did I say lactic acid treatment what is
it called good genes alright moving on
and yeah we're gonna finish this up
actually the last two items I want to
talk about are the Anasazi of Beverly
Hills moonchild glow kids I've been
adoring this this week I love this
palette this is so unique and unusual
and special and I've been adoring it my
favorite shade has been pink heart which
I didn't even like this one when I first
got it but it's definitely been my
favorite shade but honestly all of them
are so freaking gorgeous and fantastic
absolutely beautiful really really love
this and then the last item that I have
been loving is from benefits this is the
real cheeky party palette it comes an
adorable adorable packaging you get a
bunch of different blushes or
highlighters or bronzers depending on
your skin tone in here and i have been
it's especially loving the shade right
here called coralista so anyway sorry
i'm looking at my camera really this is
16 minutes long but anyway i hope you
guys enjoyed this fails and holy grails
thank you so much for joining me and i
will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
