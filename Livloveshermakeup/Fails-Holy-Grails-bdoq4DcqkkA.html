welcome back to fails and holy grails
for the week let's just get right into
it I'm going to start with my failed
there is only one and it's a bad one so
this is the vagisil intimate wash this
is the odor block one now I don't have
issues with odor and down there but I
got this one because I knew it would
smell better because anything that
claims to be odor like blocking always
smells better and I'm huge on sense i
love anything that smells really good so
it really really does smell good i just
do not like the formulation of this
nearly as much as the summer's eve
intimate cleansing wash which is what
intimate cleansing wash and cleansing
wash i guess it has got an intimate but
the summer seeds lindsay wash is really
nice it has like a really really sick
formula it is pH balance and he doesn't
irritate me down there this on the other
hand is filled with alcohol and all
sorts of weird like sodium laureth
sulfate but like just some really crappy
stuff i should have looked on the back
before i purchased this because i didn't
like the way it lathered and on top of
that this stun this stung down there and
I'm talking about after i waxed even
like a week after i had wax down there
at this steel stung and i just don't
think that's appropriate and i don't
think it's appropriate to have alcohol
in a product like this that you're using
down there i'm your lady bits so um yeah
this was definitely a fail i will use it
out maybe i'll mix it a little bit with
my summers need cleansing wash which i
really really do prefer but this was
just like an absolute disaster for my
downstairs area just really really stung
and burn and made me itch a little bit
like a stay away from that product so
that was the only film for the week let
me get into my holy grail so the first
one is this swab natural scaly
clarifying shampoo i love this stuff it
is so amazing i have just been not
washing my hair very often this past
week oh no I was really really busy and
I just was like being I don't know gross
and not washing my hair a great other
day like I normally do so i was getting
i don't know i said i was watching a
baby every to every three days and it
was getting so dirty that you could see
like those little gaps like in between
the hair you know when your hair is
really dirty
I said this in the other video too when
you hear is really dirty and it starts
to like gap up like it just that's what
started to happen so I really really
have been enjoying using this swab daily
clarifying shampoo it's one of my
favorite clarifying shampoos it's super
cheap smells amazing yeah it's not so
good and it deep cleanses odd normal to
oily hair without over cleansing so it's
not going to wash out your color it is
safe for color-treated hair and it's
just lovely if you get so much for so
little money I guess and it works really
really well so I've been loving that I
also have have another little Holy Grail
right here this is the Kevin Murphy
angel mask this is a strengthening and
thickening conditioner it is for colored
hair um and yeah it's basically just a
revitalizing treatment it's wonderful I
do get this at my hair salon they refill
it every single time I go and it just
smells so good it's got amazing
consistency I feel like it really does
thick a nap and like plump up the
strands like a pair that i have a very
very fine flat hair and I feel like it
makes it look a little thicker a little
bigger and I just absolutely love it so
this has been really really like my
go-to I think every time I washed my
hair I've used that clarifying shampoo
and then gone in with the deep
conditioner because i really only wash
my hair like toys this all week alright
moving on let's talk about some skincare
items I have been loving that my
Neutrogena oil-free acne stress control
triple action toner I've been using this
at nighttime um I haven't gone crazy
with skincare this week and again last
week I didn't either I've just been
liking a very minimalistic approach to
skincare this week so this is all that
I've been wearing on my skin at night
time I love it it's just having very
overpowering kind of alcohol ease
cucumber ease I'll do it um so it's not
necessarily like a sill wait to smell or
anything like that but it really really
does clear up blemishes and how cells
look acid in it so it also does
exfoliate your skin and I have been sick
I if you guys don't know I do have
bronchitis I know you probably can't
tell right now but two days ago it was
really bad to the point where I could
not even talk which is why I took a few
days off from filming so I don't know
when I'm sick i just don't really reach
for tons and tons of stuff you know I
don't want to pile tons of skincare on
my face I'm just not in the mood
the end of the night I just want to go
to bed you know I just don't feel good
so this has been really really nice and
that is all I've been using on my skin
at night time and then I've been loving
my bozhe makeup breakup cool cleansing
oil I talk about this all the time but
it really has been a favourite this week
I've actually been using it and then
going in with my makeup eraser and
wiping off the oil with the makeup
eraser and i have been loving that
combination so this is definitely been a
Holy Grail the next thing I want to talk
about is the mask that I've been wearing
this week and this is so cool this is
the dr brandt needles no more 3d filler
masks and I got this is a 500-point perk
sample from Sephora and it's just so
cool it's got this really really
interesting like creamy consistency to
it but it's one of those products that
you want to put on like during the day
before your makeup because it is like
that instant gratification sort of thing
I feel like a lot of dr. Brandt's
products are especially his needles no
more products they're basically the
product that you put on it instantly
pumps up fine lines and wrinkles and
this does that as well what you're
supposed to do is take a little bit put
it on your neck to upward strokes up
towards your cheekbones and basically
just pumps things up it firms things up
and it looks amazing underneath makeup
it has a really really interesting
consistency that's a little tacky when
you first apply it and then after a
while it just turns into like a powder
finish on the skin so it's really really
awesome again not something that you
would wear at night time just because it
is one of those instant gratification
products it doesn't really do much for
your skin over time in my experience um
well I would say with my experience of
the regular needles no more I have gone
through three bottles of that and I just
feel like that's one of those things
that you just want to take a little bit
and tap it on the areas that you want to
plump up before like a big event or
something like that it doesn't really do
anything for your skin in the long run
but definitely like in the morning
before I don't know before I go on stage
or show or whatever or just whatever I
want to put it on its really really
fantastic so I enjoyed that mask um the
next thing I have been loving is the
Stila aqua glow serum foundation I've
been wearing this all week I've been
wearing like all like of these stila
aqua glow products always I'm not really
all just like to basically but I
loving this teal aqua glow serum
foundation my shade is fair I've done a
whole review on this I think it's an
absolutely fantastic beautiful beautiful
water-based foundation it is so
comfortable on the skin I have two
layers of it on today it builds really
really beautifully and it's just so
comfortable on the skin and then I've
also been wearing my aqua glow water
color blush in the shade water lily this
is again from stila and it's just a
beautiful beautiful beautiful color look
at that color isn't that key billa isn't
that gorgeous isn't it gal just Carol
its couches yes it's beautiful i love it
i think it just has a gorgeous gorgeous
consistency again it is a completely
water-based so it just feels so good on
the skin and it's so blendable like it's
just so blend of all that is what it
looks like when you completely blend it
out almost not even noticeable on the
cheeks but still really really beautiful
and I have been applying that before I
apply my powder so I'll put on my
foundation put on this blush with a damp
Beauty Blender like right on the apples
of my cheeks and then put my powder on
top so been loving that as far as lips
go this week I've been wearing like my
volleyball chacha pong been a bomb all
of those little um tinted lip balm whoa
tinted lip balm homes from benefit this
week right now I'm wearing cha-cha balm
which is more of a um like peachy coral
a sort of color i also have Posey bomb
I've just been wearing these all week
they're very very comfortable on the
lips again I wasn't feeling very good
towards the end of the week and these
are just really really easy nice way to
get some color on your lips without
looking completely dead so enjoying
those a lot as far as lashes go I've
been wearing my Urban Decay subversion
lash primer topped with the covergirl
super sizer in black and the Sephora
outrageous curl mascara love these the
outrageous curl mascara is amazing it's
got this tiny little wand like that and
it's so chunky and adorable and it just
goes right underneath those lower lash
line like the those lower lash line so
it goes right into the lower lashes
really really easily it's fantastic and
the super sizer is just one of my
favorite drugstore mascaras in general
it's just absolutely fantastic
it's got a really really interesting
different kind of wand but if you are
not new to my channel then you know I
talked about this mascara quite often I
just absolutely love it I feel like it
lengthens the crap out of my lashes and
I really enjoy that alright the next
thing I've been loving is this cream
blush as well this is from L'Oreal this
is the visible lift color lift blush in
the shade rose gold it's absolutely
stunning this is what is on my cheeks
today and it is just beautiful like I
don't even know how else to describe
this I apply it again with a Beauty
Blender and I've just been loving these
kind of cream products on my skin this
week they're very very natural and very
um like they don't look like they're
completely set in like I felt like when
I looked back on some of my videos this
week maybe I look like a little oily or
a little greasy but a lot of people were
commenting that they thought my skin
looked really beautiful and kind of
glowy and I feel like that is because of
cream products so really really enjoying
those and I've been loving this little
elf shimmer palette this is one of the
products I'm trying to use out in 2016
and this is lovely it is also cream and
it just has four different kind of
highlighting colors that are really
really beautiful they are completely
creamy and just easy to blend easy to
work with and again I apply those with a
damp Beauty Blender before I set my
foundation with my powder all right as
far as concealer goes this week I've
been loving my L'Oreal visible lift blur
concealer this is in the shade 301 fair
this is gorgeous underneath the eye area
this will never crease and like cake up
in your eye area it's got a beautiful
formulation I've been even if you have
more mature skin that gets like a little
like creepy underneath the eyes this
will still look beautiful it's just got
an amazing amazing consistency to it so
I absolutely love that and let's talk a
little more about skincare on the where
is poor poor black kid steamed foam
cleanser and pore tightening cooling
foam cleanser from KO lion i've been
enjoying a lot this week not so much the
top one which is the steam foam cleanser
but the bottom one which is the pore
tightening cool foam cleanser I love it
it smells amazing it really really wakes
my skin up in the morning I think it's
absolutely wonderful I guess if I had
to mention another fail for the week
besides that intimate wash it would be
the top half of this little cleanser
because the poor blackhead Steve foam
cleanser really doesn't work on my skin
and it smells like poison so don't like
that one but I love the one on the photo
and then the last thing that I want to
mention that had been a favorite this
week is the Korres wild rose of vitamin
C brightening oil I have been wearing
this every single night before I go to
bed hey on it is beautiful on the skin
so that is the other thing that I have
been topping with my now that I think
about it I have been putting something
on after this I know I said that all I
was wearing with the Neutrogena acne
stress control toner all week but this
is something that I have been putting on
after that and I think it's absolutely
beautiful it's got a beautiful
consistency a little goes a long way and
it is just beautiful beautiful beautiful
on combination and oily skin it just has
a wonderful consistency it sinks in
right away and I noticed definitely
brightening properties along my jaw area
where I have hyperpigmentation from acne
scarring so that has definitely been a
favorite so those were my fails and holy
grails for the week I hope you guys

one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
