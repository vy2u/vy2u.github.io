and welcome back to base in Halle rail I
am combining my fields and Holy Grails
from last week and this week so this is
the combined one the video might be a
little longer than they usually are but
not really because honestly what
happened was last week I was out of town
I was visiting my family and I didn't
have good equipment or lighting to fill
my fields in Holy Grails and I thought
you know what I probably shouldn't do it
I asked you guys what you would like to
see and you guys were like can you just
combine them and I was like that's a
great idea
so I did end up getting back in the
middle of the week
and I really didn't feel like shopping
my stash for new products so technically
I have been using all of the same makeup
hair skin care products for the past two
weeks now there are a few items that I
did switch up and I will tell you
whether or not they were a favorite for
this week or last week when I get to
that but for the most part everything is
the same and I am dying to shop my stash
after this because I am so used to
switching out products on a weekly basis
that I'm literally like um I'm just like
twiddling my thumbs like I'm ready to
switch product out now so let's get
right into it shall we
I'm gonna start with the fails there are
four of them for the past two weeks so
the first one is this pur Lisse daily
lip and nourisher with mango and shea
butter I've been trying to use this for
two weeks now this is like the worst lip
balm I have ever used in my life I don't
know how the lip balm can be so shitty
actually I really I truly mean that like
I really don't know how it can be this
horrible it comes in this nice little
squeezy tube no problem I believe I got
this in my allure Beauty box you know it
you just push and then it comes out I
don't really like the applicator I feel
like the product starts pushing out over
the top and then it gets all messy on
the lips it feels great when you're
putting it on it smells like mango
everything seems fantastic and you wake
up in the morning and you're like what
what just happened like your lips are
actually more dry than they were the
night before and I am very aware of my
with my lips I am very aware of my lips
and I will flutist literally if I wake
up in the morning and my lips are even
more dry I'm gonna freaking notice that
Kay so this was a piece of heat alright
moving on the second fail was also
something that I was using last week
when I was traveling this is the over
list hydrating shampoo
oh my god that's the worst thing that
ever happened to my hair first of all it
smells like sheep second of all um it
just literally there was no lather there
were no suds it did not clean my hair if
you guys watched some of my videos that
I did post last week um the ones that
weren't pre-filmed you probably noticed
my hair looked a little grimy and gross
those were days where I had washed my
hair this does nothing it doesn't lather
up it doesn't Sud up it just literally
made my hair looks so gross and greasy
and it left a film in it it doesn't has
royal jelly fruit extracts and keratin
in it
no no horrible all right the next
product that I did not like was also
something I travelled with last week and
I've been trying to use this up because
it's a nice little 100-point perk and I
wanted to use it up it's taking forever
this is like the product from hell this
is the fresh soy conditioning eye makeup
remover it smells like rape huh which if
you guys eat Indian food that's like the
UM what is that it's like a yogurt sort
of sauce or dip that they use like with
Indian food it smells like Greek yogurt
basically this smell is sort of
offensive to me but not so much it's the
fact that this product just doesn't work
whatsoever it doesn't take off even
regular mascara let alone waterproof so
yeah this was definitely a fail and I'm
gonna continue to use it up I swear it
only have the smallest amount left but
again I don't know because I can't see
past the label and this is the product
from hell that literally just keeps
lasting forever and ever but I will try
and use it up we shall see by the way I
did use up that shampoo so that's going
in the empties babe you guys to see me
rant about that again probably in about
a week or so but as far as the lip balm
goes I'm gonna try and combine it with
other products but seriously how can the
lip balm be such alright moving on the
Sarah May or Sarah B makeup removing
cleansing cloth if you watched my
follow-up haul that I posted right
before this you would have known that
these basically burnt my base box these
are just horrible I could not believe it
Sarah Bay or Sarah B it's supposed to be
a very like not a natural brand but they
are supposed to be for life sensitive
skin you're supposed to be able to use
them dermatologists recommend this brand
I've had really good luck with their
moisturizing like lotion tubs some of
their serums some a lot of their
products are amazing these burnt my face
so bad they did not burn my eye area
which is weird cuz normally makeup
removing towelettes for
I area but not my face this burnt my
face so I don't know what went on with
that it doesn't have ceramides it
removes waterproof mascara I didn't feel
like it removes waterproof mascara but
it didn't burn my eyes but it burned my
face so I don't know what the hell is in
here but it did not work for me so no
all right now let's get into the Holy
Grail so I have a food item that I have
been loving the past week and that's our
that is that our and that is that is
these two little Tazo T's right here
these are so good
the first one is the Tazo flavored
organic peachy green tea and it is the
refreshing blend of green and black
teens with flowery peach and delicate
cucumber notes I have been making these
iced with my little what is it called I
have like this pitcher that's like a
fruit infused like pitcher I like to put
the teabags in there coz they don't like
I don't know they don't separate in
there or anything like that and they
just make great iced tea so this one's
really really good it does have a little
bit of a higher caffeine level I did
have two cups of this before filming
this video so that may be why I'm a
little more hyper than my other video
but it definitely does have some
caffeine in there from the black tea and
in the green tea but honestly so good
you can taste that cucumber you can
taste the peach in there and then you
can taste the green tea I can't really
taste the black tea but seriously good
and then the second one is the taco
flavored organic a bramble wine and by
the way I've got both of these they were
on sale two for eight dollars at Target
this one is jammy notes of strawberry
and black cherry color green
rooibos and green tea this one has a
lower caffeine level which is better I
probably should have tried this this
afternoon but really really good as well
you can really taste the cherry and the
strawberry and it just tastes so good
ice so I really have been enjoying those
four iced tea they're good hot but I
prefer them iced just because they
remind me of the springtime in the
summertime so love those four lip
products for the past two weeks I have
been using my Bobbi Brown University lip
palette it looks like this and you
basically can create any sort of lip
color that you want with this you can
mix and match them you can wear them by
themselves you can do whatever you want
so you get some nice colors in there you
get I feel like it's really really great
for the fall time but today
have this little color mixed with this
one right here so you have some shimmers
you have some neutral colors some nude
some pink some reds a little bit of
everything really fantastic and I love
it all right
as far as blush goes this week I've been
loving my makeup revolution um sugar and
spice palette I posted a picture on
Instagram of the highlighters in here
that are amazing but these are great for
travel that's why I've been using them
for the past two weeks you get a nice
arrangement of beautiful blushes in here
ranging from really neutral to a little
bit like darker fuchsia pinks and then
right here I'm sorry right here you have
those gorgeous gorgeous highlighters
look at this highlighter okay yeah do
you see that amazing so now I've really
been loving that blush palette they're
very pigmented very easy to blend very
creamy freakin baby wipe okay um just
really really good-quality I think
they're absolutely awesome and those
pallets are like under ten dollars and
then I've also been loving the makeup
revolution all about bronzed palette and
again I you know picked this out last
week because I was traveling love it
really have gotten into here especially
these lighter shades over here I like
them for contouring my nose contouring
my face
I didn't contour anything today but this
is a really really nice little palette
all right moving on
last week the only foundation that I
wore the whole week was the L'Oreal
Paris infallible Pro matte foundation my
shade is 101 classic ivory this is one
of my favorite foundations ever it's
amazing it's got great medium to
buildable absolutely full coverage to
like do it like you can really build it
up a lot it's beautiful it does stay
really matte on the skin it doesn't dry
out my combination skin like around my
cheek area but it doesn't make me a Lee
and my teeth um so yeah best of both
worlds and I've used a lot of this up
actually and then for this week I have
been loving my josie maran a vibrancy
foundation fluid so I'm gonna talk about
this a little more I did a first
impressions on this earlier this week I
will talk about it a little more in
depth when I do it my follow up review
it there are a few things that aren't
amazing with this product but for the
most part this is one of the best
formulations of foundation I have ever
tried in my life
it's absolutely gracefully and
beautifully on the skin and I'm just I'm
in love with it I love the formulation
of it so that has been what I have been
wearing this week and I am wearing it
that today all right moving on let's
talk about skincare because I've been
using the same stuff for two weeks now
so as far as serum is concerned I've
been loving my Lancome advanced
genifique youth concentrate to
activating I'm sorry no youth activating
concentrate kind of got it right there
it is and I've been using this in the
morning and at night as my serum and
everything that you see that skincare
wise I've been traveling with like the
little small mini versions because well
they're small and they're mini and
compact and easy to travel with so I
love that I feel like it does good
things for your skin honestly but you
have to use it over time it's not
something that you're going to use in a
week and see a difference you have to
continuously use it I have gone through
I think two or three full sizes of this
this used to be my go-to serum it's very
similar to the Estee Lauder advanced
night repair it does the same sort of
things but it's very gradual if that
makes sense so you're not gonna see
instant results
alright and then at night time I've been
loving the origins high potency at night
immense this is a nutrient-rich night
cream it's amazing it smells very
similar to the Olli Henriksen truth line
which is kind of like an orange
creamsicle scent I really really love it
it's amazing it's got a great
formulation to it and I still have a lot
in here and I've been using it every
single night for the past two weeks
as far as daytime moisturizers go I've
been liking it a lot behind them liking
is the philosophy multi rejuvenating
cream with broad-spectrum SPF 30 this is
going to leave your skin greasy no
matter what you do because it does have
SPF in there but it has a nice fragrance
to it if you have sensitive skin stay
away it's gonna be too much for you I
can say that right away but it does have
SPF 30 in here I feel like it doesn't
waster eyes the skin and I have been
mixing in these little bio songs
revitalizer I think they're called
squalling squalene drops I really don't
know how to pronounce it I've been
mixing 2 to 3 drops of this into my
night time moisturizer and also my
morning moisturizer and I was really
unsure about this product at first so
there it is it's called bioscience they
revitalize their 100% neo and Sons
squalane drops
squ al
and II how do you say that squalane
squalene uh I wasn't sure about this
so squalane or whatever the oil actually
comes from like the liver of like
endangered sharks and I'm just against
that in all forms I don't like that
because the specific sharks that they
get it from is they are like an
endangered species and then on top of
that I just don't like the thought of
putting fish oil on my face um however I
did look up this particular brand and
this is actually a natural I believe
it's like a vegetable it's like a base
from a vegetable or something like that
so it's not from actual sharks but what
it's supposed to be is just a
lightweight oil that immediately sinks
into your skin and puts like a layer of
moisturization over your skin kind of
like a protectant like aqua for
something like that it sinks in very
very quickly and again if that one is
all like a hundred percent sourced from
I think it was vegetables or flowers or
something like that so it has nothing to
do with animals which I like and yeah it
really has been helping to keep the
moisture in my skin basically is what
I'm trying to say all right moving on
OOP a little hair there moving on I have
been loving this Oscar blondie dry
conditioner spray um this is amazing so
what you do with this is you use it like
a dry shampoo except it's the opposite
so it's a dry conditioner so if your
hair is feeling really crispy or
something you can take it and spray it
and it will make your hair nice and some
so I've been loving that been loving
these little me back papaya nectar mini
bath ice creams these are fantastic
they're just little mini back bombs they
were great to travel with they smell
amazing and they are comparable to the
lush ones my fragrance pairing for the
past two weeks has been the Aeryn water
lily Sun which smells amazing like roses
and flowers and cupcakes will no not
cupcakes it smells like flowers but it
makes me think of cupcakes it smells
really really good and lovely and I just
love the scent very very much like very
reminiscent of spring in my
and I've been oh she's great I always do
that oh my god it does not taste that
cupcakes all right I have been pairing
that with my body fantasies Japanese
cherry blossom fragrance body mess and
display this a little lower oh this one
is a strong one so if you really don't
like that Japanese cherry blossom sort
of strong scent you're not gonna like
this
this one is stronger than the one from
Bath and Body Works like I'm singing
that right now and that's a pretty
strong one so that's crazy but those
ones pair really nicely together they're
both very slowly and wonderful all right
a product I used up that I loved was the
NYX matte finish long lasting setting
spray amazing setting spray I use it to
kind of prime my face and then I use it
to lock in my makeup gonna toss that in
my empties fan I also used up with this
chlorine dry shampoo with oat milk I
love this I want a full side of this I
don't feel like you need to get a high
end dry shampoo but this one's really
damn good and I did use it up I really
liked it and it was just very very nice
it didn't leave any residue in my hair
didn't leave it feeling crunchy or dirty
just made it feel really nice and good
and clean all right I also used up under
this blue glow Peter Thomas Roth 24
karat gold pure luxury lift and firm ass
been using this for the past two weeks
love this I would definitely consider
purchasing a full-size of this it really
lifts your skin and brightening it and
kind of pulls it taut
oops I threw it in the trash can't buy
an accident it's okay it's okay I'll get
it later anyway I like that one it kind
of pulls it up makes your skin just look
a little lifted if you have aging skin I
think you would actually really really
like it a lot I put it on my neck area
down my decollete all over my face I
just lift that stuff up okay love it
alright for a toner I have been using
the pixie skin treats glow tonic
exfoliating toner in the morning and at
nighttime it's amazing it's got glycolic
acid in it which helps to exfoliate your
skin asked a hesitancy and aloe vera so
really really good product you do want
to wear SPF if you are wearing this
during the day though but yeah I really
cleans my face nicely and I like what it
does for my skin and then for like
setting in that my skincare I've been
loving this Jun Jacob spa collection
neroli hydrating
it's paraben free preservative free
really really nice little facial spray
right here it's not comparable to
miserly crows water balancing this but
it is better than the tony moly what is
it moisture mist i like this one a lot
very very good moving on a shampoo that
i have been loving this week is the
kevin murphy hydrate meet wash really
luxurious very very nice i may have to
pick up a full-size of this when I visit
my salon next time because they sell
Kevin Murphy exclusively at my salon for
buffing in at my foundation this week
and putting on my powder I've been
loving the Tarte airbrusher airbrusher
air airbrush airbrusher like I feel like
that should that should be the name of
the product cuz it's a brush and a
airbrush is your base I think it's
called the airbrush buffer foundation
broad brush but this is what it looks
like it's amazing it's super super
fluffy really nice II just like this
that's he Ian I love it um let's see
here for hydrating not my Chafee ass
hands I've been loving my skin fix ultra
rich hand cream it's fragrance free it's
lovely it really seals in the moisture
and it was a light nice little travel
size alright for my hair for the past
two weeks I've been loving the Pantene
silky moisture whip love this love this
love this is a fantastic product it's
only 399 at Target I put it from my
earlobe down and it just really really
sinks right into my hair I love the way
it makes it feel and I also traveled
with the it's a 10 miracle leave-in
product last week I have only a little
bit of this left as you can probably
tell it got all worn off there I don't
know what happened every time I put
stuff in my luggage and I pull it back
out it looks completely different I
don't know what happened but this is
great I used to not be able to use this
one it made my hair very oily when I had
virgin hair but now I bleached it on my
hair so it works now and it puts
moisture back into my dry mouth hair
alright for eyebrows this week this brow
drama creme pomade from Maybelline is
amazing I love this you guys know I'm
really horrible with using pomades or
powders I just like a pencil in my brows
if I'm doing anything with my brows and
this one's amazing just for filling in
at the front of my eyebrows use a very
very light hand that's all I want to say
very good products though my color is
the lightest one which I believe is
called ash blonde all right I've been
using this belief Hungarian water
essence this is a fantastic I really
loved this before I put on my serum it
just gives a little bit of extra
hydration to the skin it's not as good
as the cream or lab was that was called
I think was called creme or lab or
something like that I got that from
HauteLook that was a different kind of
aqua essence water fluid that I really
enjoyed a little more than this one this
one literally feels like water but it
really puts moisture back into your skin
and if you have oily skin you would
probably like this a lot you could this
could act as your actual moisturizer all
right for primer this week I've been
loving my Maybelline Baby skin instant
pore eraser and I've been loving this
for this week and last week it's amazing
it's just got a very silicone e sort of
texture to it really good product and
then for eye cream I have been loving my
SK 2 essential power eye cream this was
a little hundred-point perk you guys
I've been using this day and night for
the past two weeks I have not even made
a dent in here if I can open it I highly
recommend if you ever see the little eye
creams like this on the sephora.com
website for a hundred or two hundred
fifty point perk pick it up you guys
because these will last you forever
alright two more items mascara this week
I've been loving my Urban Decay
perversion this was a little tiny one to
travel with for this week and last week
it is a very wet formulation it does get
all over your eyelids but I still like
it
and then for eyeliner this week I've
been loving my jelly pom-pom two and one
eyeliner in shadows so they gorgeous
kind of plummy purpley deep muddy shade
and I've been wearing this on my
waterline and my tight lines all right
is my combined failed and Holy Grail let
me show you this that is my combined
failed and holy grails for the past two
weeks I know it's a long video if you
made it through the end thank you so
much and I will see you guys in
tomorrow's video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
