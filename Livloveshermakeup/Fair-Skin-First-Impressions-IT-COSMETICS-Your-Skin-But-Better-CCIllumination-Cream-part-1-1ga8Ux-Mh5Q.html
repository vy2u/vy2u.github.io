morning this video is going to be part 1
of 2 on a first impressions on this
particular baby right here I woke up and
I was like I want to put this on my face
today if you didn't know it cosmetics is
one of those brands that does have
really good quality ingredients and I
did get my lupus shot two days ago
my skin is acting a little dull and
lackluster and dry and I just thought
this would be a really really nice
product to try out today
so anyway what is it this is the it
cosmetics your skin but better see see
illumination color correcting
illuminating full coverage cream you do
have anti-aging ingredients added in
here as well as a hydrating serum with
an SPF of 50 which is amazing it is a
physical sunblock so it does have
titanium dioxide 9% and also zinc oxide
6.3 I tend to do better with physical
sunblock so if you do have more
sensitive skin you probably will as well
and if you guys didn't know what this
particular brand is developed with
plastic surgeons and dermatologists it
is clinically tested paraben free and it
cosmetics is a cruelty-free brand so
there are five different shades that you
can choose from this does retail for I
believe $38 on the Sephora comm website
I will link it down below if you guys
would like to scoop it up there is 1.0
80 US fluid ounce as a product in here
which is a little more than the standard
foundation the shade that I did pick up
is called fair and this is the shade
that I wore in the regular CC cream I
did like that CC cream and I kind of
missed it I was going to go and pick it
up but then I thought you know what I
can get this one and try it out and see
if it's similar or if it will help with
my more like a dull lackluster dry skin
during the winter time so although I
have tried out the regular formula I've
never tried this one out I don't know if
they're very similar or not but I know
that I love the packaging on this so
like I said there are five different
shades to choose from did I say that yet
I feel like the deepest shade which is
called fawn is not actually that deep
but from what I remember the fair shade
is quite light so just something to
think of and yeah they claim that two
pumps of this foundation will give you
full coverage and it will last 16 hours
on your face so this is what the box
looks like I love it it's just a
beautiful like pink little box and here
is the actual product I love this
packaging I really like that she does
the pump thing I think that's really
really just good and impressive in my
opinion I just really enjoy that I can
pump it out and have control of how much
product is coming out and yeah there is
my shade fair so let's go ahead and just
start priming my face first of all so if
you guys didn't know I did already go
ahead
and put my skincare on of course you
wouldn't know but I'm telling you now I
put my skincare on I'm using a little
more um probably for like sensitive skin
today just because I am a little more
sensitive so I used my simple micellar
cleansing water and then just went in
with a light oil everything has
completely sent in so as always I'm
going to go ahead and apply a primer to
half of my face they want I will be
using today is the Bobbi Brown vitamin
enriched face space I just feel like I
do kind of need this moisture today so
I'm going to go ahead and apply that to
the right side of my face I am taking it
underneath my eye as well and on my
eyelid because I do like to test my
foundations out for the first time
around my eye area to see if they can be
worn or kind of double up as a concealer
because you would be surprised as to how
many foundations actually look really
good underneath the eye and I am one of
those people naturally that I do kind of
take the foundation underneath the eye
all right so on the side that we did go
ahead and prime I will be applying this
with a brush though I will be using my
Real Techniques what is this called
expert face brush and then on the left
side I will be using my damp sponge so
this is the Real Techniques at the end
sponge so let's go ahead and just jump
right into it if I feel like I need to
powder my face I do have a morphe what
is this flat top ooh
powder brush here handy and then I do
also have my ELF tone correcting powder
in cool this isn't super super densely
packed it's just kind of nice to like
dust powder on and then this guy is one
of my all-time favorite powders that I
know and love and trust so I am going to
go ahead and start pumping this out so
here is what the pump looks like I think
it looks really really good I really
like the way that she packages her
things so let's go ahead and start with
about two pumps that is two pumps right
there and I am just going to zoom you in
a little closer so I'm going to go ahead
and take this and dot it on to the side
of my face that I did prime already and
I will take it around at my eye area as
well so I'll probably take about one
pump on the other side and I'm going to
blend that in with the brush so let's
see how it looks I do feel like it's a
good shade mat I don't know if you guys
can see that but I feel like it looks
pretty darn good I was so worried when I
got the original CC cream I was like
there's like five shades I'm sure the
lightest one won't match me but it is
pretty good it's a little more on the
yellow tone side and it does darken up
throughout the day alright so that was
probably about one pump I do feel like
it looks kind of luminous and glowy on
the skin but nothing too crazy it's not
like I put on like my Becca a backlight
priming filter or something and you can
see like a shiny appearance it is kind
of clinging to some dry areas up here by
my hairline and around the eye area it
looks pretty good so far so I think that
looks pretty nice let's go ahead and
take the rest of that and we'll see if
we can build it up a little bit builds
of that coverage I'm really hoping that
this doesn't cling to too many dry
patches I don't notice that the original
CC cream did that much the only areas
that I think I noticed it was clinging
to were around my t-zone which is weird
because I am combo skin so you would
think that those areas would be very
oily but it did look slightly patchy in
that area so I don't know if you guys
can see this but I do feel like this is
filling into my pores here it could just
be the brush so it's quite possible that
it is that we will go ahead and apply on
the other side with a sponge but I think
the color is pretty darn good I think it
looks nice on the skin it definitely is
like it has like a luminous glassy look
to it not too oily looking but it's also
not super super matte obviously so yeah
that is the side that is done and then
here is the side that is not definitely
a little more yellow toned over here but
I think it looks pretty good it did
relatively well around the eye area um I
think it covered and it's not sinking
into any sort of fine lines or anything
like that so we just blend one more time
I'm noticing I'm getting a little bit of
brushstrokes when we built that second
layer there it is around my nose
crevices not too bad either so yeah
let's go ahead and apply it to the other
side now again I am going to take two
pumps and then I will apply a little and
then we can build it up again should put
it on the other hand all right so just
dotting that on
it looks nice over here
I would don't think that I'm really
going to need to set it I will anyway
because honestly for you know longevity
of my foundations I do need to do that
but it looks pretty like it has a very
beautiful natural finish so now let's go
ahead and blend in with the sponge hmm
we shall see which side looks better and
then at the end of the day we can see
which side wore better as well as far as
primer is concerned because my last
video a lot of you were saying that the
side that had primer on it wore a lot
better all right so that is about one
layer I do feel like that went on a lot
more smooth but a little more sheer so
let's build it up or put the other pump
on I should say so we can have even
coverage I like the way it's going
underneath the eye area actually I am
somebody who does take foundation
underneath my eyes like every day when I
do my foundation I'm just not huge on
concealer so I do enjoy when a
foundation looks nice like that oh wow I
feel like I'm getting a lot of coverage
over here now actually it's funny it's
always like a toss up either the sponge
side is always more coverage or it's
like the brush side but I think I like
the brush side a lot more I just think
the coverage looks better I'm not
getting any sort of like dryness here
maybe just a little bit around my
hairline
I was just extra dry when I woke up this
morning but this side it really looks
like I put makeup on this side is just
kind of like oh is that my skin is it
makeup or is it my skin so what do you
guys think so here we have the sided
with the sponge and then over here at
the brush side I think I like it better
with the sponge so I'm going to go ahead
and finish this side off really quickly
and just so that I can give those
finishing touches there's really not a
lot of product like left on here don't
worry but I just think it looks better
with a sponge you know I usually can
tell right away if I'm gonna like a
foundation with a sponge or with a brush
so I vote sponge for this one definitely
good news the actual sunscreen in here
is not singing my eye area
which is awesome so yeah okay so that's
about four pumps on my whole entire face
which is quite a bit of this product but
God the finish is so pretty like it just
looks pretty I don't know how else to
describe it hopefully you guys can see
what I'm talking about it's like there's
almost highlight on your face but there
isn't I just think it looks really
really good so here is an up-close look
at my forehead area as well I do think
I'm going to need to set this in I know
what I did the one layer I probably
could have gotten away with not setting
it in but I'm going to set it in so
we're going to take that morphe brush
and then I will take my ELF tone
correcting powder and you shade cool and
I'm going to stipple this on I didn't
want a brush that was too densely packed
because then I feel like it really does
kind of finish off the face in like a
perfect way so I want something that
will just set it in but not like make it
look flawless and this brush right here
is definitely not flawless from morphe
so I am just going ahead and tapping
this on it is definitely starting to
emphasize my dry texture on my forehead
but like I said I really do need it if I
want it to last for a couple hours a
little bit earlier my face will start to
melt off in a couple hours so I
definitely think it's wearing a lot
better in my t-zone and also on my
cheeks it just looks a little better to
me I don't know what you guys think but
for me yes that's that's what I'm
noticing let me zoom you guys in just a
little closer here so this is what it is
looking like with the powder on I feel
like you can still see a little bit of
that sheen but it looks it looks
relatively good to me I probably should
have put a little more color there on my
nose I didn't really hit up that area
but probably one layer there and then
too everywhere else I definitely think
it gives nice like medium coverage what
I say is absolutely full like full full
coverage now but I think it does look
quite nice so the only area I'm
concerned about is this area where I'm a
little more dry again just gonna cap
over my t-zone and I will be back to do
part two for you guys at the end of my
board day like I said it is currently
thirty little B four or five thirty in
the morning right now as I am filming
this so I will be back to check in with
you guys and let you know how this
particular product wore throughout the
day so there it is again so this is the
side with the damp sponge and then this
is the side with the mmm god brush hair
on my mouth okay this is the side with
the primer and also the brush sponge
brush so yeah that is it I will see you
guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
