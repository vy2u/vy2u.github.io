thank you so much for joining me this
video is going to be unboxing or an
undying on the Ipsy bag for the month of
februari so februari 2016 unpacking this
is my first month getting it see you're
supposed to get um five beauty products
in here for ten dollars a month which I
thought was a really really great deal
so I'm just going to open it up and you
guys to see what my first impression on
this bag is so the first thing I see is
just a little card that's as pretty in
ypsi pink and you can win a one-year
glam bag subscription by sending a photo
of your glam bag goodies two hashtags
I've you're a glam bag hashtag
sweepstakes hashtag it see on Instagram
so that is what it looks like and then I
have heard or I have seen that if sea
bags come in a cute little pouch every
single month and I love stuff like this
I love to reuse the little tiny pouches
like this whether I be carrying around I
don't know makeup in my purse or like
hair accessory is something like that I
think it's adorable so this month is
really cute it's kind of like textured
on the top and almost looks like it's
beaded and I think it's adorable looks
like a little piece of mail it's a
little hard on it and then it says it's
the up here and it is hot pink on the
back and I am NOT thanks so let's see
what's here the first thing I see is
something that I already have my hands
on this is actually the Smashbox new
photo finish primer oil I got quite a
few of these little deluxe sizes I'm
through sephora recently and i actually
really really do like the oil so i am
more than happy to have another little
sample size and again it isn't oil it is
a primer oil but oils go you know a
little goes a long way so I'm super
super excited for that the second thing
I see I've been wanting to try these
interesting ok this is the mr. right now
eyeliner from the ball and i love the
ball and see if i can open that i love
the bomb cosmetics like I think it's
great and totally fantastic i really
really just enjoy that brand a lot and i
have been curious about these little eye
pencils i want to be able to swatch this
please open alright i'm not gonna be
able spot checks i can't open it but
this is the mr. right now pencil in the
shade jack which looks like it's like a
nice like greenish brownish kind of
color and like i said i've heard a lot
about these i heard
they are quite good so yeah I'm excited
to try it out alright the next thing I
see is the naked cosmetics this is the
Sierra Nevada mica pigment this looks
really interesting let's see if I can
take this off alright so this is what it
looks like really cute little packaging
it's like a little acrylic cube and I
don't want to spill all over I'm scared
it's gonna come flying out yes it is
alright so if this is the color it is
actually really beautiful let me go
ahead and get a little bit of fat on the
back of my hand and swatch it that would
look beautiful with like some glitter
glue primer or something like that right
on the lid i think that look gorgeous it
feels really really finely milled so
that is cool and i say to play with that
i don't use a lot of like glitters and
pigments but i think this one looks
really cool alright and then the next
thing I see in here is the Jersey Shore
spa anti-aging lip and hand polish is
all natural the scent is vanilla bean
and it is nutrient dense with anti-aging
ingredients like vitamin E and hobo oil
so this is a nice size product and I
love anything that's for your hands or
your lip so it's actually a lip polish
it's like a it's like a scrub right I
have to smell it too because I'm a big
person when it comes to sense oh it
really smells good and yeah looks like
it literally is like a scrubs toward
formula very interesting my hands and
lips get very very dry during the
wintertime so I think this will be fun
to try out let me see the texture is
very very gritty and there's definitely
some oil in there so those are tons of
good scrub it says our anti-aging lip
and hands polish is formulated using all
natural nutrient dense ingredients that
hydrate and exfoliates leaving eadamson
hands silky soft and moisture rich so
very very cool that's probably the most
exciting thing in there in my opinion
and in the last thing oh my god okay
that was super super weird okay that
freaked me out at first I thought this
was open um but it looks like that's
like the little lid for it this is this
product I felt this was like open there
was no cat but this is the tristique
this is the baby blush stick in Bora
Bora coral cute what a pretty color is
kind of peachy nudie that is what it
looks like and let's go ahead and swash
and swatch
his hand oh it's nice it's not like
super super pigmented but it is really
really pretty nice pretty color alright
so that is everything that is in a my
bag for the month of February's from
Ipsy i would say most excited about the
little pouches probably the lip and hand
polished and also the mr. right now I'm
liner sorry I couldn't open that for you
guys like very tightly sealed but anyway
I hope you guys enjoyed this little
embedding thank you so much for joining
me and i'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
