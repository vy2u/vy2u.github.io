wanted to come on here and share with
you guys a little salt festive tea and
just beverage haul in general this
shouldn't be too long but I did order a
bunch of teas if you guys can see and
you know I love tea so I thought I would
share with you guys what I got but first
of all let's go ahead and start over
here I thought I would also share with
you guys one of my favorite drinks
during the holiday season this is silk
almond milk that's unsweetened to the
vanilla kind with Tazo chai classic
latte concentrate I don't know if you
guys have ever tried this they also have
a pumpkin spice version that you can
pick up this time of year but this it's
just so so so good I love this and what
you do is you mix half of this into a
glass so with any sort of milk or milk
substitute like I said we really like
these silk almond milk and it just
tastes amazing and so so good so I
wanted to mention that and then also
before we get into the teas I wanted to
mention another favorite of Tom and eyes
during the holiday season I don't know
if you guys have ever tried the
Martinelli brand we get this and we also
actually everything here that you guys
see is from Amazon and but anyway the
Martinelli brand makes some really
really fantastic sparkling sighters and
after just apple juices they are US
grown fresh apples they taste so good
and they come in these adorable little
little containers like this like it's
just so perfect and this is honestly
some of the best apple juice I've ever
had in my life I love juice I love apple
juice so really highly recommend
checking these out and also their
sparkling cider czar amazing they're
super expensive on Amazon so I highly
recommend picking them up at like
Walmart or Target but the sparkling
apple cider in the cranberry version
also the pomegranate and also just the
regular apple is amazing alright so let
me show you guys some of the holiday
festivities I picked up so celestial
Seasonings definitely has some new like
holiday teas this one is not new but
this is the honey vanilla chamomile this
is an herbal tea and I really like this
at nighttime it's a beautiful beautiful
tea a very very mild flavor very
laid-back and is just absolutely
delicious so I picked up a box of that
and then here is one of their new
holiday teas this is called the
Nutcracker Suite and it is black tea so
it definitely does have some caffeine in
it it says this blend features rich
black tea made with festive creamy nutty
vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon so I'm
guessing it's gonna taste kind of
similar to like chai it but really
really excited to try that out
and then I picked up one of my all-time
favorites I have been drinking tension
tamers since I was probably I don't even
know I want to say like a freshman in
college this is an herbal tea it's so
good so basically there is a Chinese
herb in here it really really helps with
like headaches and things like that and
it also does have let's say your
peppermint spicy ginger and lemon in
here I do put a little bit of extra
honey or any kind of sweetener in here
just because honestly it's not the best
tasting tea but I swear to you I love
having a like cup of and nighttime when
I'm grading papers and not that grading
papers makes me super super like tense
but you know what I mean it's just very
relaxing and a very nice teach half so I
enjoy that and then I picked one up from
Tazo this is the organic baked cinnamon
apple I thought that sounded perfect for
this time of year it is a rooibos tea I
love red teas so it is herbal base and
it says spiced apple nestled with rich
rooibos for a sweetly indulgent herbal
infusion with other natural flavors and
it is caffeine free I thought that would
taste amazing and then I also picked up
a box of the celestial Seasonings
peppermint I love peppermint tea I
talked about this in tea time with live
this month it is caffeine free and I
drink peppermint tea all the time I
drink it hot too during the cooler
months and then I drink it cold and ice
during the warmer months really really
good especially if you do have kind of
like a weak stomach like I do I always
joke around but honestly sometimes I
wake up I said this in my tea time with
live sometimes they wake up feeling
super sick and I feel like peppermint
tea really calms down my stomach so I
picked up a box of that and then here is
a celestial Seasonings this is a
seasonal favorites tea this is called
sugar cookie sleigh ride this is also
caffeine oh you guys I swear to God not
happened yesterday magic water video -
I'm just choking on my own spit that's
super cute this is called sugar cookie
sleigh ride it is a caffeine free herbal
blend of delightful sugar cookies with
like eight herbal base it tastes amazing
and I absolutely love this tea I did get
it last year and then the final one that
I picked up is also new this is part of
their new holiday tea set and this is
cranberry vanilla Wonderland I love
everything cranberry I feel like
cranberry you can drink all year long
but especially during the winter time I
thought it would be great and I think
that this one would be really good iced
what do you guys think it says this
distinctively it's sweet flavor with
rich crimson color cranberries made our
cranberry vanilla wonderful and herbal
tea a joyous celebration of the season
it is capping free tea so it has natural
botanicals like rooibos and hibiscus
plus cinnamon and a touch of vanilla so
very very excited to try out these new
teas you guys may see some of them in
tea time would live at the end of the
month anyway I hope you guys enjoyed
this little video I am going to go off
and film a bath and Bodyworks haul for
you guys now and I will see you later
tonight bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
