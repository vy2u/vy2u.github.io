vlogging like a vlogging I'm on
my phone again I'm happy Tuesday I just
wanted to make this video before I get
ready and head to work so this is the
last time I'm just gonna address this
okay because now I'm getting a lot of
questions a lot of comments about what
exactly is going on I didn't think that
this would turn into this big
drama okay I know a lot of people seem
to think I love drama but I don't like
drama honeys got a full-time job
I've got other to worry about the
last thing I need in my life is a big
whopping steaming pile of drama okay so
let me just kind of explain to you
anybody who was concerned so I wanted to
start a newest series on my channel
called miscellaneous Monday and I am
following through with miscellaneous
Monday is not that kind of channel where
you come and I'm expecting 18 year-olds
to be watching my videos I want to make
this very very clear my highest age
demographic is over the age of 25
74 % of the people that are watching
this video right now are over the age of
25 25 - I believe 37 is my highest age
demographic so for all of you that we're
leaving comments yesterday saying that
the video was incredibly inappropriate
my bisexuality Q&amp;amp;A was incredibly
inappropriate first of all you don't
have to click on the damn video honey
you knew what he was about what did you
think I was gonna talk about in that
video
it's a bisexuality Q&amp;amp;A of course I was
gonna be talking about sex second of all
my boyfriend watch that video through
yesterday there were no issues I edited
that video which means I watched it back
at least three to four times so people
who are coming into the comments and
saying why are you suddenly posting
content like this Jesus Christ I mean
I'm pretty sure I made it very clear
that this series was coming and that it
was gonna be very open and if you didn't
want to watch that don't
click on the video and I know I'm coming
off as a pissed-off bitch right now and
guess what I am pissed off
I'm pissed off because I think it's
disgusting that there were so many
people that went and flagged yesterday's
video and just because they couldn't
handle the fact that I was talking about
bisexuality come on people get a
life I ended up removing that video
completely after YouTube said that they
were going to do a manual review I'm
guessing is that probably over 50 people
flagged
which was just a bunch of in my
opinion again don't click on a video if
you already know you're not gonna be
happy with the content I know there's
gonna be people with this video that are
like oh you're just you're just so full
of drama I'm unsubscribing and that's
fine but you know what me talking about
my bisexuality me talking about sex
especially when my highest age
demographic is twenty five to thirty
seven if I only cater to eighteen year
olds and I didn't swear and I was just a
little goodie old two-shoes like
a lot of the booty gurus on here honey
I would not be posting that kind of
content I'm not that stupid okay
so yeah I just wanted to jump on here
and let you guys know I will be re
uploading at that video and next Monday
there might be a few little things I'm
gonna edit here and there but for the
most part you know what you're gonna get
when you come to my channel so please
don't come here acting all shocked when
I'm talking about my sex life and if you
can't handle it honey
you can't handle it and I don't mind so
yeah last thing I wanted to say there is
going to be a beauty related content
coming up and later today so I will have
an anti haul going up and then tomorrow
we are doing midweek mysteries so again
if you're not into true-crime and that
kind of stuff this is part of my new
little this is part of a new that I
want to introduce on my channel so that
I don't get bored okay because the
beauty world can be incredibly
incredibly a dry as and boring and
I needed something new so they're still
gonna be five beauty videos this week
like I said anti hell coming up later
today but that these are this is my
final thought on this situation that's
all I wanted to say I'm sorry that some
of you couldn't handle that video
yesterday but it's going back up next
Monday experience with polyamorous
relationships the Monday after that so
yeah if you missed the video it'll be up
next Monday but that's pretty much it
welcome to the new channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
