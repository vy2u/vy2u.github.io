thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having a fantastic day this
video is going to be my introduction to
my finished 6 by summer challenge this
is technically a project pan of video
but I'm not calling it that I'm calling
it a challenge video because I feel like
a lot of people that do project pan
videos have different thoughts about
like purchasing items and things like
that and I'm gonna explain in a minute
why I'm not calling it a project pan
video but I was inspired to do this by
Christine Kay here on YouTube I'm gonna
go ahead and leave her video below and
also her channel she uses up a lot of
products she was the one who inspired me
to do the one month one pallet challenge
and that would really well I really
enjoyed doing that and I thought you
know I should try this out she
encouraged me to go ahead and maybe pick
out a few deluxe size or sample items
that I would like to try out for my
first kind of project pan video and I
was just like you know what I'll do it
so I am very very excited I did go ahead
and pick out six items I have to wait
three makeup items I have a two skincare
items and bath items is that right yeah
one bath item two skincare and three
makeup items and a lot of these are like
halfway done or I've used half the
product one of them I haven't even
touched yet but that's a powder and the
reason that I'm not calling this a
project pan a video on my channel is
because I personally know that a lot of
people that do project pan and videos
don't purchase new items or they kind of
don't want to go out there kind of like
on a no-buy they don't try and purchase
anything in that until they have hit pan
on that particular product or until they
have completely used up but that product
now you guys know i like to review all
the new stuff that hits the market I am
in no way shape or form ready to do a no
buy on my channel or just in general I'm
not interested in that
however I am interested in still using
not products that I have I have a large
collection of skin care and hair care
and makeup and I want to get through
some of these items so I did go ahead
and choose that six items
um like I said I have some skincare some
makeup and I'm gonna show you guys what
they are so the one product that is
like one that hasn't been touched I'm
going to say a full-size most of them
are full-size except for two of them
this is the essence all about Matt
fixing compact powder I have not gotten
into this at all and the reason I feel
like I can use this up is because I
really go through powder quickly and by
the way I am trying to finish up this
challenge by June first that's what I
consider summer so I am giving myself a
good two and a half months to use these
products out all right so that is the
first item I am going to try and use up
the essence all about Matt fixing
contact powder the second item I took
Kristen's suggestion and what ahead and
chose to kind of deluxe size items I
recently went through like a deluxe size
of this and this one is actually
completely full this is the Boscia
revitalizing black hydration gel I
really like this in the warmer months
and I would love to get through this
little sample because it is already
opened up and there is a nice amount of
product in here there is 15 ml or 0.5
fluid ounces so I definitely feel like I
can get through that in two and a half
months all right the next product I have
here is the wet and wild photo focus
setting spray I have used probably a
third of this up and I really would like
to use it up completely so this is what
it looks like and I believe I could get
through that in two and a half months
and then I have another deluxe size skin
care item this is the Vichy I'm ideally
asked in sleep this is a beautiful
lightweight kind of hydrating
moisturizer but it's like a gel I've
used about half of this little container
and I just don't reach for it very often
I have had it for a while and I don't
want it to go bad skincare can go bad
pretty quickly so I would love to use
this up as well and then the next item
you can see I've used a lot of but this
has been sitting around for like a year
and a half in my skincare collection and
it is ready to be used up completely in
my opinion it's starting to it's not
like it smells different
it just doesn't smell as good as it used
to so I feel like it's starting to kind
of you don't want to say it's gone
completely bad because I can tell when
an item has completely gone bad but it
smells a little
different than when I first purchased it
so I would love to use it up this is the
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works aromatherapy energy
lemon zest body wash and foam bath and I
definitely think I can get through this
in the next two and a half months and on
top of that it's a beautiful like lemon
citrusy bright scent for spring and
summer and then the last item that I
would like to use up before June is the
Garnier five-second flirt skin renew
instant smoother this is a lovely primer
that I really like to reach for it in
the warmer months and I've had this for
about a year and a half now and I the
texture I started to change a little bit
now it's not great the again it's not
completely bad I can tell when my makeup
has gone bad because it starts to
literally just smell bad if this doesn't
smell bad but the texture is not the
same as it used to be and I spent a lot
of money on this this was like 17 or 18
dollars at the drugstore so I would like
to go ahead and use that up I would say
I have used half of it so and that's it
the last item I am trying to use that
before June 1st so like I said this is
not really a project pan in my eyes
because it's more of a challenge video
for me to get through some products I
still will be purchasing new items you
will still see reviews on new products
I'm just not at that point yet where I
want to do a no-buy I'm sure at some
point in my life I will do a no buy but
for right now this is what I'm
comfortable with
and yeah let me know down below if you
guys are gonna join me for this little
um finish up so you know finger shops
summer finish 6 my summers challenge and
tell me which products you are going to
use down below and yeah I will see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
