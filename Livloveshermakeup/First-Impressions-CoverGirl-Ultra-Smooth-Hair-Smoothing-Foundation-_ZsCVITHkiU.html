this morning I am going to be doing a
first impressions review my first first
impressions review for you guys on the
new covergirl ultra smooth hair
smoothing foundation + applicator it
looks like this mine retailed for around
8 99 at walgreens and like i said that
is what it looks like and this is the
applicator it's just a small little
rubber like magenta pad so as you guys
can see it already concealed i used my
covergirl Ready Set gorgeous to conceal
any pimples and I used my Maybelline
instant age rewind in the brightener
formula under my eyes and on my eyelids
i will be using my ELF tone correcting
powder in cool to set this foundation
this is my Holy Grail and let's just get
started so on the back of the tube it
actually says squeeze small drop of
foundation directly on applicator and
apply to face in the direction of facial
hair growth interesting I personally
take care of any facial hair that I have
you know on my face but this will be
interesting onna if you can smooth down
hair it should be able to smooth you
know your whole campus so I will just
get started by the way I am in the color
805 ivory so here's someone there 805
ivory this is their lightest shade and
I'm really really hoping that this does
not oxidize covergirl foundations tend
to oxidize on my skin so let's hope that
doesn't happen so I am just going to
like this says squeeze small drop a
foundation directly an applicator and
apply to facing direction of facial
growth so I'm going to take about that
much to begin with I guess just start
applying this
hmm this is not smooth ah not with this
thing ah I can already tell I'm gonna
hate this I don't want to use this I
know and I don't think that that is
something that's good to use it does not
seem to be working all of the actual
foundation seems to get balled up on the
actual applicator so guys I'm going to
go ahead and use my trusted handy-dandy
fingers so I'm just going to take a
little more of that and just blend it
into the skin
it seems to be covering what it should
cover which is nice always nice on a
foundation does that um it's not very
smooth which is funny you would think
that this would be a lot smoother
because of the name but um don't don't
actually feel amazingly smooth when I'm
applying it and I do have moisturizer on
i toned I have my serum on my
moisturizer oh so it's not really
covering and having some hormonal
breakouts it's not really covering those
big uh breakouts what I'm having but
let's keep going um you know like I said
it doesn't feel like it's very smooth
but it is blending into my skin so there
is let's see here one application
good a little closer so with one
application you may little mirror here
it's not very good coverage right here
I'm really breaking out and it doesn't
seem to be taking care of that at all
that's some kind of when stuck in my ear
hold on I when I washed my face my face
scrub gets like dried on my skin after i
use it sometimes okay so it looks very
natural and it doesn't feel like it has
set yet you know what let's go ahead and
do one more layer of this I really want
to see if I can work it up so
particularly where I'm breaking now you
know my forehead my cheeks so
but like I said interestingly enough
this really doesn't feel very smooth I'm
like what the packaging says so that is
kind of annoying I plan on doing a
follow up follow up review on this
product I'm just one of those people
that can't film a video and check
throughout the day and then tell you
exactly how I feel about the product I
need a couple of days to use it so i
will do a polyp review over you guys but
it won't be until you know about a week
of using this i want to you know try it
out which concealer without concealer
putting my concealer on after instead of
before things like that just different
ways of using it so i will have a follow
up review in a little in a little bit
but this is what those two applications
look like so far um does not feel that
great I think I think it looks okay it's
definitely not every coverage i would
call it maybe medium light to medium
coverage yeah i'm not particularly
impressed it did not cover this area
that was like a really bad area from you
right now so yeah I would say it feels a
little sticky it doesn't feel like it's
set yet i'll give it a few more seconds
um but yeah it doesn't feel like it has
even set yet on my skin which is kind of
annoying because i have let it you know
sit there for a while really
disappointed i didn't cover more of this
area because like i said that's a really
troublesome area for me right now i
think i need to blend it a little more
into the hairline because it's looking a
little orange i really hope this doesn't
oxidize carpet girl foundations tend to
oxidize on my skin and turn really
orange so we'll see about that
but um ah not absolutely love with this
it looks a little better as its setting
I guess we will see now since I don't
have all the time in the world I'm going
to go ahead and set it with this powder
so just taking my eco tools kabuki brush
and just setting this
hmm loving the coverage guys not 11 it
now
alright so this is what it looks like
like I said it did not even out my whole
skin texture I still have some stuff
going on there you can still see on my
forehead and breaking out but not too
shabby it looked much better once I said
it it looks very smooth once I said it
so I am kind of happy with that like i
said i will be doing a follow up video
in a couple of days um I just can't be
one of those person people that checks
back and then comes and tells you guys
exactly what I think of it I need a few
days I need to try it with different
setting powders different concealers
things like that so I hope you guys
enjoyed this first impressions and um

date with when I have my you know after

thoughts things like that so I hope you
