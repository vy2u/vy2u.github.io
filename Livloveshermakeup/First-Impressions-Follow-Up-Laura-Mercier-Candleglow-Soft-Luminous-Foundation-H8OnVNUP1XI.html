thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having a fantastic day I am
here to give you guys a follow up of
first impressions review on the Laura
Mercier candle glow soft luminous
foundation I did a first impression
review on this a week ago and I'm going
to link below where that video is if you
guys would like to watch it but I wanted
to come back after a week and let you
guys know if I'm still enjoying this
foundation in that review I did seem to
enjoy it quite a bit and if you guys
watched it you would have seen that I
was really really happy with the
coverage I was really happy with you
know how everything looked on my skin
and now that I have used it for a week I
have been able to you know kind of
decide whether it works really really
well with other products how it wears
how long it wears you know things like
that so I am really really happy to let
you guys know I am still and continuing
to love this foundation I think it's
just really really beautiful it's got a
really really beautiful beautiful finish
on the skin it's got light to medium
coverage and I would say one coat is all
that you need it will give you enough
coverage with one coat and when you try
and build on it it just starts to get a
little like it just doesn't look as good
when you try and build up multiple
multiple coats on the skin and I did see
that when I had applied it in the first
impressions video and if you guys watch
that video you would have seen when I
put the second layer on I was just like
wow it doesn't look nearly as good as it
did when I just put the first layer on
so I think that definitely still is the
case I think that this color shell which
is supposed to be fair with cool
undertones is still a really really nice
for me I could definitely darken it up a
bit if I need to it's a time light for
my skin tone which is actually a really
really nice pace of change because
normally the lightest foundation in any
sort of line is usually a little too
dark for me so it is a nice little piece
of change that this is I've had like
late
than my skintone so I can darken it up
with a powder without any problems
especially if I'm bronzing my face that
day or if I am contouring so I'm really
really overall just very happy with it I
just wanted to come back in and check in
with you guys and let you know that I
have tried it multiple ways I've tried
it now with a Beauty Blender the Real
Techniques sponge I've tried it with
foundation brushes I would say when you
use it with a foundation brush does take
away a little bit of the coverage but I
think it looks absolutely beautiful
applied with the fingertips like I did
in the original video but also with a
damp a beauty blender or a Real
Techniques sponge I think that it just
looks absolutely absolutely gorgeous so
I'm happy to say that this Laura Mercier
candle glows soft luminous foundation
was definitely a success and I just
wanted to come back in and check in with
you guys and let you know that um you
know trying it with different primers
trying it with different application
techniques has been just an all-over
really really good experience so I
really really do love it and like I said
I will link the original video below in
the description bar if you guys would
like to watch it thank you for joining
me
