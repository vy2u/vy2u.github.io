excuse me welcome back to my channel and
welcome back to look of the week where I
share with you guys the makeup I have
been wearing on my face this week I'm
obviously completely bare face and oh
I've Carmex am I know so if it looks
like it's boogers it's not as Carmack's
okay it's very very dried nostrils
anyway today I'm sharing with you guys
obviously the makeup I have been wearing
this week and also yes I'm wearing Tom's
shirt this is what I sleep in so I know
I look like a hot mess right now but
this is how I show up on camera for look
of the week also I wanted to say that
last week I did not do look of the week
I did a first impressions get ready with
me where I tried out five new products
to me so before we get into look at the
week I'm gonna give you guys my final
thoughts on those products so the first
one that I had tried out was this
Clarins instant likes lip comfort oil
initiate is 0-2 raspberry I absolutely
absolutely adore this you guys it's a
gorgeous gorgeous color a really nice
like pouty pink color very glossy on the
lips obviously if the lip oil it's a lot
more thick than any sort of leak oil
that I have personally tried and on top
of that I find it extremely extremely
long wearing and moisturizing so I
really have been enjoying this and I
will be doing a battle of the lip oils
video later this week also let's see
here I tried out to the Sephora
collection outrageous Volume Mascara and
this stuff is the bomb I don't know if
you guys watch the video from last week
but it really made my lashes in two
coats look very very nice and long and
also thick so I really do enjoy this if
you are someone who likes a lot of
length and a lot of thickness I think he
would like this quite a bit that is what
the actual wand looks like super inky
dark black formulation I did tell you
guys that it like broke off here and
it's kind of messy as you can see but I
will say this is a really really nice
mascara very very decent very very good
and I would highly recommend purchasing
that as well as the Sephora outrageous
curl mascara which is one of my
favorites
alright moving on the next two items
that I had tried out to wear these
little guys right here we have the Kat
Von D lock-it to concealer creme e in
the shade whiteout I really like this
underneath the eyes it's very beautiful
it blends out freakishly fast freakishly
it's very very beautiful I think the
white out sheet is great to mix with any
sort of concealer that you have that is
a little darker I personally have been
using it with the it cosmetics
bye-bye redness this week which is what
I did last week as well in the video and
I really really liked it it stays very
nicely on the eyes it does not make your
under eye look cakey by any means and I
just think it's a beautiful shade I do
like that shade now on the other hand
the locket translucent setting powder I
don't really like this it's a very cakey
if you put two layers of this underneath
your eyes who instantly will have like
lines and just like you know it looks
like your fine lines are like deep set
wrinkles yeah I have fine lines and it
made it look like my under eye was like
deep set wrinkles and on top of that I
just think it looks kind of strange it
has a little bit of a tinge of like a
strange color to it also so I do like
you for underneath the eyes but like to
set my whole face noway in how like this
is super super cake face so I think it's
just okay and then the last item that I
have tried out were these Sephora green
tea exfoliating wipes these are
mattifying and anti blemish I have been
using these in the morning
to cleanse my face and then go in with
my skin care which is what I did today
and I really like these now when I did
the first impressions I was using the
abrasive side and I will say I cannot
use this abrasive side it's much much
much too harsh like I can't imagine
imagine anybody using that abrasive side
it's just way way way too harsh but the
soft side is great they don't smell that
good honestly I really like the smell of
the rose ones these don't smell that
good however I will say that they work
and I've had my period this week and I
feel like yes I have some breakouts but
they're not that bad and also it's been
keeping me very very matte so I do enjoy
those alright guys anyway let's go ahead
and just get into look of the week now
so the first thing I'm going to do is go
ahead and put on my primer I will be
using the Bobbi Brown vitamin enriched
face base in this little sample size
right here and I am almost completely
this is almost completely gone so we're
just gonna take a nice little chunk of
that maybe not that much but we'll take
about that much and I'm going to put
this all over my face and I really like
this it smells quite good I would
consider purchasing a full-size of this
however I do think there are better
primers out there and I'll talk about
that a little more in my face I'm holy
gross tomorrow but it does smell good it
smells like lemon pound cake girl I love
cake
pound cake and I love lemon so I like it
alright moving on we are going to go
ahead and put on our eye primer this
week I have been using the balm
cosmetics the the bombs the bombs or the
balm cosmetics is the balm cosmetics put
a lid on it i frame her I hate saying
that I always say that I'm wrong I don't
know what is wrong with me everybody
always corrects me and I'm like I can't
I can't take it it's strange alright so
that is what the eye forever looks like
and I'm just going to go ahead and put
this onto my lids and then any excess
that I have I will actually take
underneath my eyes this is a very very
Dometic own silicone like eye primer so
I don't mind having it underneath my
eyes because it really does help my
concealer to go on nicely because like I
said I do have some fine lines under
there they are starting to show up now
that I am 24 and I barely get any sleep
they are there all right moving on guys
we are going to go into the it cosmetics
bye bye redness neutralizing cream and
basically what I've been doing this week
is using that and then going in with my
foundation since this is a little dark
so and this is what it looks like and I
am just going to take a little blob of
this and basically what I do is I just
put this on areas like around my nose
and also any little pimples that are
like red so right now my chin around my
nose whatever the hell that is on my
eyebrow your god
oh what is that what was that so yeah I
just kind of put it on like that and
then I've been going in with any sorts
of like buffing brush like this this is
the Sigma round kabuki f82 brush and
then I just kind of buff that in and
yeah I don't know what's going on with
my eyebrow there but anyway I like this
because it does neutralize the redness
but it is quite dark so I hate when
brands are like it's a universally
flattering shade and then it's like
really because it looks a little orange
on my skin okay mm-hm
hmmm alright moving on it we are going
to go into foundation the foundation
I've been wearing this week is the NARS
Velvet Matte skin tint with
broad-spectrum SPF 30 my shade is Tarun
wave a light 2-0 I'm gonna give that a
good shake and then I'm gonna put some
on the back of my hand like this and
then I will be going in would find a
Kohl conceal EO this is like the air
buffing foundation brush thing this is
the most amazing foundation brush ever I
swear to you my two tarts foundation
brushes are literally life literally a
life I don't know anything else that
applies my foundation so smoothly and so
quickly other than at my too foundation
brushes that I have from Tarte it's
absolutely amazing and I really like
that it doesn't soak up the product
because the bristles are super super
like packed in there very strongly so
the products it's literally right on top
of the bristles and then you're just
able to like glide it onto your skin and
you would think that this short little
brush would be like hard to hold in your
hand but it's not at all so I've been
loving that and you guys will see that
as a Holy Grail tomorrow as well as the
other Tarte brush huh I see that cur mix
in my nostril I don't like that anyway
so all right
after I have done that I'm going to go
ahead and we were going to conceal
underneath the eyes so I'm gonna take
that Kat Von D lock-it creme concealer
in the shade whiteout and I'm going to
put this underneath my eyes like this
and this stuff is quite thick but like I
said it really blends out easily and
very very nicely and then I do put the
bye-bye redness neutralizing cream a
little bit of that underneath that as
well so we'll take a little more of that
bye-bye redness cream put that
underneath my eyes no my eyelids and
then I will be going in with this morphe
kind of pointed foundation brush and I
am just going to blend that in and it
amazes me how easily these blend in
absolutely amazes me especially that
locket concealer creme because it's so
strange because it's like a very thick
kind of formulation and you would think
that it would take ages to blend out but
it really
really goes quickly and I know a few of
you were saying that too and last week's
video you were like oh my god uploaded
I'm so fast and I was like I know so
yeah I'm just kind of stippling bringing
it down so that this area is a little
more light but I love how it takes care
of the darkness underneath my eyes like
I feel like there's a visible difference
you know what I mean so I really do
enjoy that and then we are going to go
ahead and we are going to set this under
IO right away so I am going to take that
locket translucent powder and I'm going
to take let's see here I've really been
enjoying this little elf brush here I
think I used this last week as well the
elf angled blush brush I'm going to take
a little bit of that tap it into the lid
and then I'm just going to tap
underneath the eye and this stuff is
very messy it flies all over the place
but if you set it in with one coat it
really does look good and it does lock
it in all day I will say that so I like
the way it looks underneath the eyes I
just do not like the way that it looks
all over the face and one coat like I
said is quite enough if you go in with
the second coat it will start to look
kind of caitli so something to be aware
of
because I was not aware of that the
other day and I went in really really
hardcore and I was like oh my undereyes
gonna be set all day long it's gonna
look amazing and I look like so
alright moving on now we're gonna set in
our face I'll be using my Maybelline
okay my maybelline superstay better skin
skin transforming powder in the shade at
number 10 porcelain and I'm going to
take my be you beautifully Foundation
Pro flat kabuki brush I got this on
Amazon I really loved this brush and I'm
just going to go ahead and set in the
rest of my face I've been noticing this
powder does oxidize on me a little bit
which is why I did go ahead and I chose
a lighter foundation that's a little
light for me right now that's NARS
Velvet Matte skin tint in teheran Wave 8
is slightly light on my self tan skin
right now but I still am assessed at
this powder you guys still completely
obsessed a few people were asking yes
obsession is still there it's just so
beautiful and it does have salicylic
acid
it does not dry out the skin at all
which i think is amazing so very very
nice I'm just obviously stippling this
on to the skin to completely set
everything in cuz Mama is an oily beast
and an oily Beast all right moving on we
are going to go into blush mmm excuse me
keep having something on my throat this
morning um I'll be using my real cheeky
Purdy palettes from a benefit I love
this container like this this makes me
excited all right and I'm going to be
taking let's use coralista today so
coralista is right there right there no
right there and I'm going to be taking
this Ecotools kind of fluffy bronzer
blush brush and I'm really packing it on
there and I'm going to apply that
directly onto my skin and you may be
like holy hell like that's crazy but
honestly these are those kind of blushes
that you kind of like layer onto your
skin to look like really nice and
they're not super super crazy pigmented
so you don't actually need to tap off
the excess so I'm just kind of putting
that everywhere I'm not even putting it
on the apples of my cheeks I'm taking it
underneath towards my cheekbones like
underneath in the hollows of my cheeks
just everywhere because I really like
that color to that coral Easter shade is
nice kind of like as an all-over dusting
of color alright moving on we are going
to go ahead and highlight I've been
using my moonchild palette this week
which I'm obsessed with this is the
Anastasia Beverly Hills moonchild
palette and I will be taking my Nicole
concealed fan brush and we are going to
go into pink hearts pink heart has been
my all-time favorite shade this week and
when I reviewed this palette I was like
mmm I don't like pink heart it's my
least favorite shade but it quickly have
become my all-time favorite shade so
anyway just putting that on with my fan
brush
oh god yes that glow it's so beautiful
it's just like a cool-toned
iridescent pinky color and it's quickly
become my favorite shade this week for
sure
love it love nerve love and then I do
like to ooh a little powdery I do like
to go in with this no concealer brushes
well this is like a I don't know it's
more of like an under-eye brush and what
I like to do is just go over the areas
where I did highlight and this kind of
like buffs it more into your skin and
you can use this as bronzer as blush to
set your under-eye whatever but I think
it looks even more kind of like airbrush
when you kind of just lightly buff that
highlight in alright moving on we are
going to go into what should we do I
think we'll do let's do eyeliner so I'm
gonna use my Clinique skinny stick in
the shade slim sable zero three this is
what it looks like I'm gonna put this on
my waterline I know every time I do this
someone's like oh my god she's gonna
kill herself
and yes I probably well one day by
accident just like stab myself in the
eye but hey we did it so I just went
onto my waterline and then we are going
to go ahead I'm gonna take my ELF magic
mat mist and set and just put a little
bit of that onto my skin is starting to
go low like the product is and it's
starting to squirt out and like big big
splashes on my skin but as long as you
let it dry it's okay and we're going to
move on to I think we should do brows so
what I'm gonna do is take my ELF spoolie
and I am going to go ahead and brush my
eyebrows up and then I will be taking
this studio ten brow lift perfecting
liner I'm going to take this topi shade
over here and it actually turns out
looking a lot darker than it looks in
the little like container and I'm just
filling in the front part of my brows
that's pretty much all I've been doing
this week and that's usually what I do
just kind of filling in the front part
you guys know I'm like a no-fuss kind of
brow girl so after I do that I like to
go back in and blend that out with the
spoolie one more time and then I will be
setting it in completely with my
Maybelline clear mascara
I'm just taking this I don't want them
to go anywhere oh I need to pluck my
eyebrows god there's so many little
hairs under there anybody else have like
naturally kind of like blonde hair and
you can barely see when your eyebrows
come in and you're like yes I don't
think I've actually done my eyebrows I'm
like tuna half-month
I feel very lucky alright next we're
just gonna wipe down our lips quickly or
at least I am because I'm someone who
gets crap all over my lips and we are
going to go in with our lip product for
the week so I have been using these
Korres lip butter glosses that are so
comfortable so so beautiful the shade
that I even gravity gravitating towards
mmm nope gravitating towards the most
this week is the shade called natural
which is just a beautiful kind of like
natural color it's like a nudie pinky
color and I'm just putting that on
and I know a lot of you hate when I do
that because it goes over my Cupid's bow
but you guys it goes over my Cupid's bow
anyway because when I start practicing
the goes everywhere not just this
and you sort of lip products so anyway a
lot of people wonder they're like why do
you cover your keepest boats because I
go and then on top of that also when I'm
practicing my lip products move around
so I just can't be bothered because I'm
always playing my flute anyway so my
flow doesn't leave it like that so all
day alright moving on we are going to go
into eye shadow this week I have been
using the seal of trust and love gift
set from the holiday 2015 collection
here are all of the shades that we have
and I'm going to start with this color
all over the lid so I'm going to be
taking my let's see here Real Techniques
setting brush and going into that kind
of matte
pinky white color and I am just putting
that all over my eyelid and also I will
take it underneath my eyes for a little
bit of extra brightness as well and it
will also just make the blending process
a lot quicker and easier which you guys
know I don't like to bet
alright now I'm gonna take my BH
Cosmetics fluffy crease brush I'm gonna
go into the shade right here which is
like the perfect transition shade I'm
going to go in tap off the excess and
we're gonna work that very lightly into
the crease if we can take it down onto
the lid as well and just blending it
back and forests this will also make it
easier to blend to the other shadows out
alright moving on I am going to be
taking my Sigma T for blending a 35
brush and I'm going to take this shade
right here and I'm going to start
working that into my crease definitely
tap off that excess and it's definitely
better to start building this color
because of these shadows do have a lot
of fall out
add that on both sides
yeah these are definitely very very
powdery but I think this is one of my
favorite eyeshadow palettes from last
year's holiday collection honestly I
wish I had gotten that huge one from
Stila if they release a new big one this
year I'm getting it all right then I'm
going back in with that fluffy crease
brush from BH Cosmetics and I am just
going back and forth making sure
everything is properly blended next I am
taking this little brush here from the
Nicole concealed eyo brush set and I'm
going to tap into that darker brown
shade right there has a little bit of
purple again tap off that excess and we
are going to work this into the outer V
I'm just stamping it on and then kind of
working it into the outer crease and I
love this palette because it's just the
perfect like natural eye look like you
just can't it can never look overdone
with this palette is what I'm trying to
say even when you foil these like they
stay relatively neutral on the eyes and
I just love the way it looks back in
with that fluffy crease brush and we are
blending in circular motions this time
and then we're going to tap on a little
bit of lid color which you guys know I
like to do with my finger so we're gonna
go into that white shimmery color right
there take that with our finger and just
tap that on to the inner part of the eye
I love that shade it's like a nice light
yt pretty color I don't know I don't
know how to describe it and then any
excess I like to take on the inner
corner and then one more time with the
blending and I will take a little bit
more of that transition shade on the big
fluffy brush and work it on the upper
part of the crease and then I like to go
in with this Nicole conceal brush again
about sounds like so sponsored and like
Nicole concealing a rash no but you guys
know I bought this is my own money I
already reviewed it and I'm just kind of
going and blending out the upper crease
area alright moving on we are going to
take this little smudger brush again
from the Nicole concealing oset and I'm
going to be taking a matte color that we
went into the crease with I'm going to
take a little
that and we are going to kind of smoke
this out on the lower lash line very
very lightly
and then we'll take that outer-v shade
and we'll do that a little bit on the
outside of the eye as well all right
then I'm gonna go in with my morphe m5
11 brush and blend underneath the eye
very very lightly and since it has no
product on it we will blend the upper
part of the eye again and I'm going to
tap back into that creamy shade that we
went all over the eye with put that
right underneath the brow with the same
brush and that is it for the eye shadow
now we're gonna move on to very powdery
but look at those colors
yes all right now we are going to move
on to a mascara the first item I will be
using that you guys won't hear me talk
about tomorrow I do not like this it's
the ample eye mascara amplified mascara
serum from the brand new lifestyle
company this is what it looks like got
it in I think my glossy box I'm gonna
put one layer of this on to my lashes I
did not curl them but that's okay I've
kind of been like not curling my lashes
lately I don't know why but whatever all
right and I'm just putting a one layer
of that all over them and then I'm going
in with my extra lash sculpting mascara
from Laura Mercier which looks like this
I'm gonna put one layer of that on as
well and I've not been liking the way my
eyelashes have looked this week and I
know it's because of that ample i
amplify whatever mascara serum because
normally this mascara looks bomb on my
lashes and I have not it it just looks a
little too weird and spidery for me and
you guys know I like spider lashes so
that's straight for me to say and I'm
going back in with a sigma brush
anywhere that I have a little bit of
mascara crumbs just blending that out
and that is it guys that is look at the
week this is the eye look and just the
Facebook's I have been wearing all week
I hope you guys enjoyed this video and I
will have a Sephora plus back and body
works all going up about an hour after
this so I'll see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
