channel thank you so much for joining me
I hope you are all having a really
really fantastic Saturday I'm here to
share my first impressions follow-up
review on the Clinique beyond perfecting
foundation plus concealer I did a first
impressions video on this product
exactly a week ago I will go ahead and
link that in the description bar if you
are curious as to where I purchased this
how much it was if you want to see it
applied to my face I will link that
video down below but I'm just here to
give you guys my follow up Lots on the
product I've been using it all week and
I have to say I am loving this
foundation I don't think it's going to
be one of those foundations that I'm
going to be using a lot during the
summer I'm wearing it today I have one
even layer on and underneath it I did go
ahead and go in with my NYX color
correcting concealer palette I used the
yellow color here to kind of brighten
around my face I use the green to cover
redness I used this peach shade which I
have like made a huge dent in underneath
of my eyes to color correct dark circles
and also on my eyelids to brighten it
too bright tin and then I also use the
lavender shade around fine lines and
wrinkles and then I blend that in with
my Real Techniques sponge it is damp by
the way you just want to point that out
and then I go in with one even layer of
this product if you watch the first
impressions video I layered on quite a
few layers of this because I wanted to
see if it was buildable on the skin and
I will say it is definitely buildable if
you can get a lot of coverage out of
this product however I have found that
it wears a lot better if you just do one
even layer all over the skin so I will
go in and I literally take this and I
paint it on my face just one even layer
I have not had any issues with this
causing like breakouts or anything like
that I have been using this applicator
and painting it on my face every day I
have had my period this week and I have
noticed I've had a little bit of
breakouts but for the most part I have I
don't feel like I'm contaminating my
face every single time I go in with it
if that makes sense I could be I don't
know I just haven't had any reactions so
I just wanted to point that out really
quickly but I put on one even layer of
this and
I blend it in with 8d aqua Real
Techniques sponge that still is my
favorite way to apply the product I feel
like it goes on very very string key
when I apply it with my fingers or with
a brush so I highly recommend with this
particular product because it is so
pigmented to go ahead and just apply it
with a real techniques sponge or like a
Beauty Blender or a damp sponge anything
like that but overall I think this wear
is an incredibly long time like they
said I I'm wearing it today and I just
love the coverage it gets you absolutely
can go back in and kind of spot conceal
certain areas I don't like to take this
around my eyes I still do find that I've
been a little bit of a burning sensation
around my eyes which is why I went in
with my NYX color correcting palette
before I put this on my face today and I
will just you know this is basically a
color correcting palette plus concealer
in one so I'll just touch up the areas
that I need to and then go in with this
but yeah I like to avoid this when it
comes to my eye area I don't like to put
it near there because it just has a
little bit of like stinging and tingling
qualities I don't get any irritation
anywhere else so if you do have
sensitive skin and maybe check out the
ingredients in here first to make sure
that you know you're okay with
everything that's in here but overall
I'm just loving this product I think it
gives beautiful beautiful coverage it
does feel heavy on the skin not as heavy
as like the Kat Von D lock a tattoo you
Foundation or anything like that but it
does indeed feel heavy on the skin so if
you were someone who really likes a
knight a nice lightweight sort of
foundation or BB cream or something like
that you are gonna hate the way this
feels on the skin I don't feel like I
have like cement or paint on my space by
any means but I definitely can feel that
there is makeup on my face I do have to
set this in with a really really nice
matte powder or else I will get oily in
my t-zone throughout the day but I do
have combination skin so that happens
most of the time but overall I'm really
really happy with this love the shade
match which is 0.5 breathes there is one
shade that is lighter than this I did
not know that when I did the first
impressions video because the girl at
Sephora told me this was the lightest
shade but to know there is a lighter
shade that is called linen but this one
is a really really nice match for me it
might be a hair darker than my skin tone
however it really blends in nicely and I
feel like during the warmer months if I
do want to wear this during the summer I
feel like this is going to be a great
match so overall I think it's really
really nice it is quite moisturizing on
the skin I think a lot of different skin
types could you
this particular foundation if you have
dry skin I think you would like it if
you have kondal skin I think you would
like it if you have oily skin I do you
think you would like it but make sure
you set it in with a powder so overall
fantastic products you get one fluid
ounce here and it's only $27 on the
Sephora comm website absolutely loving
this if you really want to try out a
full coverage foundation and you don't
want to pay for like the cap on Dee
locket or something like that I find
this one to have just as much coverage
but it's lighter on the skin so I would
definitely recommend checking this one
out first so they hope you guys enjoyed
this little first impressions follow-up
review on the Clinique beyond perfecting
foundation plus concealer I will have my
perfect palette tag video coming up
later tonight and I will see you guys
then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
