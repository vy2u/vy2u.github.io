channel thank you so much for joining me
I hope you are all having a really
really fantastic saturday i'm here to
share my first impressions follow up
review on the clinic beyond perfecting
foundation + concealer i did a first
impressions video on this product
exactly a week ago i will go ahead and
link that in the description bar if you
were curious as to where i purchased
this how much it was if you want to see
it applied to my face i will link that
video down below but i'm just here to
give you guys my follow-up plots on the
product i've been using it all week and
i have to say i am loving this
foundation I don't think it's going to
be one of those foundations that I'm
going to be using a lot during the
summer i'm wearing it today i have one
even layer on and underneath it i did go
ahead and go in with my next color
correcting concealer palette i used the
yellow color here to kind of brighten
around my face i use the green to cover
redness i use this peach shade which i
have like made a huge dent in underneath
my eyes to color correct dark circles
and also on my eyelids to brighten too
bright tin and then i also use the
lavender shade around fine lines and
wrinkles and then i blend that in with
my Real Techniques sponge it is damp by
the way just want to point that out and
then i go in with one even layer of this
product if you watch the first
impressions video i layered on quite a
few layers of this because i wanted to
see if it was buildable on the skin and
i will say it is definitely buildable
like you can get a lot of coverage out
of this product however I have found
that it wears a lot better if you just
do one even layer all over the skin so I
will go in and I literally take this and
I paint it on my face just one even
layer i have not had any issues with
this causing like breakouts or anything
like that i have been using this
applicator and painting it on my face
every day i have had my period this week
and i have noticed I had a little bit of
breakouts but for the most part I have I
don't feel like I'm contaminating my
face every single time I go in with it
if that makes them I could be I don't
know I just haven't had any reaction so
i just wanted to point that out really
quickly but i put on one even layer of
this and
I blend it in with a dr Real Techniques
sponge that still is my favorite way to
apply the product I feel like it goes on
very very streaky when I apply it with
my fingers or with a brush so I highly
recommend with this particular product
because it is so pigmented to go ahead
and just apply it with a real techniques
sponge or like a beauty blender or a
damp sponge anything like that but
overall I think this where it's an
incredibly long time like I said I I'm
wearing it today and I just love the
coverage it gets you absolutely can go
back in and kind of spot conceal certain
areas I don't like to take this around
my eyes I still do bind that I get a
little bit of a burning sensation around
my eyes which is why I went in with my
next color correcting palette before I
put this on my face today and i will
just you know this is basically a color
correcting palette plus and concealer in
one so I'll just touch up the areas that
I need to and then go in with this but
yeah I like to avoid this when it comes
to my eye area I don't like to put it
near there because it just has a little
bit of like stinging and tingling
qualities I don't get any irritation
anywhere else so if you do have
sensitive skin it maybe check out the
ingredients in here first to make sure
that you know you're okay with
everything that's in here but overall
I'm just loving this product I think it
gives beautiful beautiful coverage it
does feel heavy on the skin not as heavy
as like the kat von d lock it tattoo
foundation or anything like that but it
does indeed feel heavy on the skin so if
you are someone who really likes a
nightly a nice lightweight sort of
foundation or BB cream or something like
that you were going to hate the way this
feels on the skin I don't feel like I
have like cement or paint on myspace by
any means but I definitely can feel that
there is makeup on my face I do have to
set this in with a really really nice
matte powder or else i will get oily in
my t-zone throughout the day but i do
have combination skin so that happens
most of the time but overall I'm really
really happy with this love the shape
match which is 0.5 breeze there is one
shade that is lighter than this I did
not know that when I did the first
impressions video because the girl and
sephora told me this was the lightest
shade but no there is a lighter shade
that is called linen but this one is a
really really nice match for me it might
be a hair darker than my skin tone
however it really blends in nicely and I
feel like during the warmer months if i
do want to wear this during the summer i
feel like this is going to be a great
match so overall I think it's really
really nice it is quite moisturizing on
the skin I think a lot of different skin
types could you
this particular foundation if you have
dry skin I think you would like it if
you a combo skin I think you would like
it if you have oily skin I do think you
would like it but make sure you set it
in with a powder so overall fantastic
products you get one fluid ounce here
and it's only twenty seven dollars on
the sephora.com website absolutely
loving this if you really want to try
out a full coverage foundation and you
don't want to pay for like the kat von d
locket or something like that I find
this one to have just as much coverage
but it's lighter on the skin so I would
definitely recommend checking this one
out first so they hope you guys enjoyed
this little first impressions follow up
review on the Clinique beyond perfecting
foundation + concealer I will have my
perfect palette tied video coming up
later tonight and I will see you guys
then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
