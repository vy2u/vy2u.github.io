this video I would quick little first
impressions follow-up review I was gonna
say hall review for you guys on the
covergirl clean matte BB cream for oily
skin I'm going to go ahead and link down
below in the description bar my first
impressions on this so you guys can
watch it you can see the way that I
applied it I applied it with a Beauty
Blender or a damp sponge with sponge bob
whatever you want to call it on one side
and then he brushed on the other side
and yeah if you guys would like to see
you know my first impressions on it I
will go ahead and link that down below
but I was very impressed when I first
used this and after I first used it and
I just continue to be very impressed
this is a beautiful beautiful foundation
now the reason I'm calling it a
foundation and not a BB cream is because
this is not a BB cream this does not
have any sort of sunscreen in here I've
went through the actual ingredient list
and it's just ridiculous oh that people
call them baby creams and CC creams CC
creams are for color correcting and BB
creams were made by plastic surgeons for
people who get like facelifts and you
know facial surgeries basically so that
they could leave the office without
looking scarred and also so that they
could have you know sun protection
because scars really don't do well
without having sunscreen on so that's
why BB creams were invented and I just
find it crazy that they're calling this
a BB cream even though there's no
sunscreen in there because the point of
a BB cream is to have sunscreen that's
like one of the main factor and then the
other main factor is just so that you
know people who do have plastic surgery
can leave the hospital without looking
like they have scars all over so I think
that's really stupid and just ridiculous
I went through with the whole
ingredients list like I said there is
not a single drop of sunscreen in here
so I do find that a little annoying but
overall I think this is a beautiful
product
it definitely has like medium to
buildable almost full coverage and I do
like to apply it with a lot of different
tools I feel like I get lighter coverage
weight yeah I would say I get like
lighter coverage with a really really
damp Beauty Blender however if I have
sort of just like a regular like not so
damp Beauty Blender I get a little less
coverage it works really well with like
a Sigma 3d HD kabuki brush it works well
you can buff it into the skin you can do
whatever you want with it and I
it just looks beautiful and least a
gorgeous finish on the face it is truly
matte all day long I rarely have to go
back in with a powder and touch up
throughout my t-zone I do have combo to
oily skin it gets very oily during the
summer and I think this is just going to
be my go-to product now the little area
where it actually shows like the product
here I don't think that's actually the
product so I thought that that was like
a little window screen I mean it looks a
lot darker than went like I hold my arm
up to it it actually comes out a lot
lighter in the tube so that's just
something that you might want to know I
am personally self-tans right now but I
think that this was a perfect color
match for me five ten fair and yeah I
think this is a beautiful product if you
do have dry skin or aging skin this is
just going to build up and sink into the
areas where you do have fine lines and
wrinkles and also you won't be able to
blend this out very well if you do have
dry skin so if you watch the first
impressions and you kind of found it
tempting I had a few comments in the
comment section in that video or end
people were saying oh I dry skin I
really want to try it out it looks
beautiful because I have oily you know
oily skin and it was gliding on because
of the oil on my skin so I just wanted
to say that if you do have dry skin I
definitely don't think this will work
for you I'm really just gonna use this
during the summertime because I feel
like during the winter this is gonna be
way too matte for me but overall really
really beautiful has an incredible
staying power as well I feel like this
lasts like literally probably eight or
nine hours without having to touch up
with powder so I really really enjoyed
this product I think it was around nine
dollars at Ulta I will link down below
and you guys can pick it up and yeah
I highly recommend checking that out
thank you so much for joining me guys
and I will see you in an hour for a
video on what's it called Oh Battle of
the champagne highlights bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
