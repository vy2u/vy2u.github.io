back to give you guys my update on the
cover girl ultra smooth hair smoothing
foundation i did a first impressions
review of this about a week ago and i
told you guys I want to have a follow up
for any kind of first impression video
that I do about a week later because i
can give you my first impressions but
honestly i need to wear a product for at
least a week to see what my full on you
know experiences with it so basically
I've been wearing this all week and I do
like it more now that i have tried it
with different things i found the best
way to apply this is with a sigma brush
flat kabuki f80 brush i just found that
this gives the best application the
first time when i did my first
impressions i was using my fingers to
apply this product because i thought it
was just gonna be really smooth because
hello it says ultra smooth i thought i
was just going to go on really really
easily and that was not the case really
emphasize my pores it just did not look
like on point at all so um I found the
best way to apply it is with the flat
top kabuki and what I do is I just like
to blend it into the skin I kind of dab
it onto my hand dab it on to these
certain areas on my face and then blend
it in and I just think that gives the
best coverage now you do need to apply
probably two to three coats of this if
you want medium to heavy coverage this
is a very light weight um light coverage
foundation like I said in my first
impressions I hated the little thing
that it came with it came with a little
plastic applicator that you're supposed
to like smooth like against I guess that
the hair on your face which by the way I
think is a complete ski out I don't
think that this is going to cover hair
on your face any kind of if you do have
facial hair find a way to remove it um
this is definitely not going to be the
solution to you know not seeing it on
your face if you have like a little bit
of peach fuzz and things like that this
is not going to smooth that this did not
I really don't find that this has
smoothing properties at all actually in
my opinion so um those are kind of the
leg
negatives about this product but overall
I found the best way to apply it is with
the Kabuki I think um if you do probably
like I said two to three applications
today i'm wearing two applications of
this i think it does build up to a nice
medium coverage the color is on point
which i'm so happy about because
covergirl usually disappoints me and ah
just when it comes to color on their
foundations tend to oxidize really bad
on my skin and I end up looking orange
at the end of the day but this color 805
ivory which I believe is their lighter
shade is like really really a good match
to my skin and I don't have any
oxidation during the day and it doesn't
turn orange so really really I'm happy
about that now I find that this is like
a really small little tube this is only
point 8 for fluid ounces and like I said
when you're using this and building two
to three coats you're going to be going
through this very very quickly I
actually recommend going and picking up
other covergirl foundations like the
outlast is a great one the outlast stay
fabulous get a shade lighter than the
one that you want to pick up because
that does oxidize like crazy but overall
I think it's just better quality it
gives really really nice coverage and
also um I think it's much more smoothing
that this is this just does not smooth I
don't know why they say it smooths it's
not smooth at all it's really hard to
blend I find that's the biggest issue is
that it's just really really difficult
to blend so um those are kind of my
thoughts I like I said think that also
oh by the way um the first time when I
used it for my first impressions I
applied concealer first and then this
like I said this is hard to blend so I
recommend if you are going to use this
go ahead and apply the foundation first
and then put concealer over it because
it's hard to blend and if you're going
to put the concealer first and then try
and
this over the top of it is just not
gonna look good so overall on a one to
ten scale I would still give this
foundation probably a four or a five
it's really not high on my list but I
can build it up to a coverage that I'm
comfortable with and also one that looks
nice once I apply all my powders and
like my NARS setting powder and things
like that it looks okay it's not
horrible color match is good and um yeah
I would give it a four or five I will
use this up I think he will go really
quickly at the rate that I use it like I
said two to three applications on my
face but overall not thrilled with this
product I don't think it helps with
smoothing hair I do have a little peach
fuzz like on my cheeks it didn't do
anything for that if anything it really
really showed more hair and it showed
like the emphasis of my pores and things
like that so anyway those are my final
thoughts on the cover girl ultra smooth
hair smoothing foundation probably would
not repurchase and yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed this we'll see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
