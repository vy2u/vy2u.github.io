thank you so much for joining me in this
video I am giving you guys a quick
little follow up review on the Josie
Maran vibrancy foundation fluid the
shade I have is dynamic and exactly a
week ago I did a first impressions on
this product where I applied it on
camera I talked about where I got it how
much it was I will leave that video down
below in the description bar if you were
interested in seeing how I put it on and
everything like that but I'm trying to
just give you guys my final thoughts on
this product I have been wearing it for
exactly a week now and I'm wearing it
today and I have to say this has quickly
become one of my favorite foundations of
all time which is amazing I just love
the consistency of it I love the bottle
I love the pump I love the shade the
shade is honestly a little light on my
skin which i think is amazing I think
Josie did a really really great job with
finding a really really great color
range for everybody it looks like they
have very very dark deep you know tones
or colors that you can pick up and
definitely this shade dynamic it's
almost too light for my skin it is
probably a shade too light for my skin
and I probably could go a shade down but
I'm just putting been putting like
bronzer on to kind of even out the color
and things like that but overall I think
the shade range is perfect I love the
consistency of this it does have argan
oil mixed in there I think if you have
oily skin you might want to stay away
from this because honestly I have found
that I do have to set this in with
powder I have combination skin I love
the way it sits on the outer perimeter
of my face where I tend to get a little
dry however in my t-zone I have to
continuously like reset that area with
powder throughout the day but I don't
mind because I think it just looks
absolutely stunning on the skin I'm
wearing five pumps of it on my face
today and that definitely gives you full
coverage with this product you don't
need five pumps that's just how I like
to wear it because personally I find
that it just gives a beautiful really
really full coverage look without being
too matte on the skin I still do like
applying it with my damp Real Techniques
sponge or my Beauty Blender that is my
favorite application method I believe
that is how I applied it for the first
impressions that is definitely the
easiest way to apply it I find if I
apply it with a brush or with my fingers
it starts to get a little streaky but
overall it just has the most beautiful
consistency to it I love the way
sits on the skin again I do have to reap
out her in my t-zone and I did try using
this product by not setting it in with a
powder because I love the way it looks
when you first apply it however you do
lose some of that gorgeous like
luminosity when you seal it in with a
powder and I tried using it that way but
I just got too oily because there is
argan oil in this product so that did
not work for me but I do like to just
set it in with a powder the one that I'm
wearing today is the essence all about
Matt and I think it gives a beautiful
finish I like the two of those combined
together the kind of luminous finish of
this combined with the essence all about
Matt gives me a really really nice matte
appearance to the skin without being too
overly matte so I am absolutely loving
this foundation I think if you have dry
skin ageing skin combination skin you're
really gonna love this and I will say
somebody had asked I mentioned in the
first impressions video I was saying it
smelled a little woodsy
like it smells very very natural it kind
of smells like I don't know how to
describe it kind of like spicy smelling
so if you are sensitive you may not like
the fragrance to be completely honest I
do have sensitive skin as well however
it's not overly sensitive but there is a
little bit of a fragrance there it's
nothing overwhelming but just something
to be aware of and yeah I think that's
about it if you have oily skin I think
this is gonna be a little too much for
you there's just a little too much um
luminosity in here and it's not like
it's like you know sparkle or shimmer or
glitter on your skin it's just a very
luminous appearance because there is
argan oil infused in your you want to
make sure you shake it up really really
well before you apply it but I think if
you have dry skin ageing skin or combo
skin you are going to love this
foundation it has quickly become a
favorite and yeah so thank you so much
for joining me for my final review and
thoughts on the josie maran vibrancy
foundation fluid again my shade is
dynamic and I will link the original
video down below are you guys I will see
you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
