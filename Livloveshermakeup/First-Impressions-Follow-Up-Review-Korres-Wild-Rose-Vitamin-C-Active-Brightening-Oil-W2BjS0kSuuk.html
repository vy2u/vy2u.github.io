you so much for joining me I hope you
were all having a fantastic day I don't
really know what's going on with this
little chunk of hair here so please just
ignore it but I have back to give you
guys my first impressions follow up on
the Korres or korres wild rose vitamin C
active brightening oil I did exactly a
week ago a first impressions on this
product where I actually applied it on
my face on camera I talked about where I
got at the price everything like that I
read a little bit about what it said on
the Sephora website I will link that
video below if you want to know all the
basic information on this product but I
am just here to give you guys a quick
follow-up on how this product has been
working for me and I'm really really
excited to let you guys know that I have
been working for me um this has been a
really really fantastic product I have
been using it every single night for the
past six days and I have noticed my skin
is firmer it feels a little more like
taut like a little more tight um the
brightening properties have definitely
been working right here on where I get
discoloration from hormonal acne along
my jaw line and I just have been really
really happy with this oil when I first
did the first impressions you guys
probably saw how easy it sunk into my
skin and how easy it was just to apply
all over my face and I'm really happy to
say that this oil is fantastic in my
opinion I have combination skin I think
this would be a fantastic oil for those
with combination skin and even oily skin
because it has such a light weight
consistency to it it just sinks into the
skin immediately they have the very very
faint Rose smell to it and unfortunately
I did find in the ingredients and
somebody else'll listed um in the
comment section after I had done the
first impressions I said it smells a
little bit like alcohol one of my
subscribers have said yep alcohol is the
fourth ingredient so that was really the
only thing that I have to say that I'm a
little bummed about is why I have a
facial products especially in oil with
alcohol in it I just don't think there's
any need for that and I feel like you
can smell the alcohol a little bit but
overall I've gotten really used to the
smell it's nothing overbearing nothing
overpowering I still don't like the fact
that there's alcohol in it however I do
think it makes it a little bit
lighter oil but overall I think this is
fantastic like I said I have been using
it for over six days now at night time I
think it's definitely just brightened up
some discoloration it's helping with
under-eye circles as well I know that
sounds crazy but in the morning I wake
up and I notice that there's a lot less
blue and purple tones underneath my eyes
I've been playing this everywhere on my
eyelids around my eyes I don't get any
sort of irritation around my eyes my
mouth anywhere really I literally can
put this over my lips and I'm totally
fine I have not noticed any sort of
active breakouts I've just been really
really happy and impressed with this oil
so I will link below where you guys can
pick it up I would say that this is just
a fantastic product you guys will see me
mention this later today in my sales and
holy grails and I'm just happy to say
that it has been working really really
well for me I think it has a beautiful
consistency it definitely has helped
brighten up some discoloration on my
skin and also some blue and purple tones
underneath my eyes and I think that's a
lot to say especially when it's only
been a week that I've been using it so I
am really really happy with this Korres
or Korres Wild Rose a vitamin C
brightening oil I hope you guys enjoyed
watching as this little progression of
first impressions to my follow-up review
AMD I think it's a fantastic product
like I said it will be linked below if
you guys would like to pick it up it is
not an affiliate link but this is a good
one and look how pretty it is with all
the little rose pebbles floating around
in there and one thing I also want to
add is that you get a whole lot of
product in here and I think that's just
awesome so I'm really really happy with
this product happy that I picked it up
and I hope you guys enjoyed it this
