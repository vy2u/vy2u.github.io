video is going to be a quick follow-up
review on the L'Oreal I was going to say
Urban Decay L'Oreal infallible total
cover foundation so I did any first
impressions on this exactly kind of like
a week ago on my channel I actually
posted the video I believe on Thursday
but it was pre filmed on Monday so I
will go ahead and link the first
impressions down below if you would like
to see how I applied this on camera
I did one half of my face with a damp
sponge and the other with a buffing
brush and I'm basically her do give you
guys of my final thoughts on this so
originally when I was filming at the
video I really actually liked it the way
it was going onto the skin I thought it
looked relatively good until I looked in
like an actual mirror basically so when
I'm applying it on camera usually I'm
kind of looking at a small mirror below
me and then also in the viewfinder but
everything in the viewfinder looks like
super super bright so I thought it
looked like it was okay but immediately
I could tell that I wasn't the biggest
fan of this foundation I did leave a
little comment in that video talking
about how it wore throughout the day and
I have to say I'm incredibly incredibly
disappointed with this the shade that I
did pick up his 3:01 a classic ivory I
was hoping that it was going to be
similar to like the pro matte but this
really has a thick mousse like
consistency to it and it actually really
reminds me a lot of the Rimmel stay
matte liquid mousse foundation this is
like literally half of the price this is
about three ninety-nine at the drugstore
you do get the same amount of product it
is one fluid ounce in the shade that I
wears like porcelain and this is a lot
better than this in my opinion I have
always thought that the Rimmel stay
matte was very very similar to the Tarte
Amazonian clay full coverage foundation
and I would in no way shape or form
recommend this for anybody who has dry
skin even if you have like combo skin
that tends to get a little more dried
throughout the day don't get this it's
not similar to the Tarte it's not
similar
I mean it's similar in consistency but
the actual finish of this one on the
Rimmel and Amazonian clay are absolutely
beautiful and do not emphasize any dry
texture on my face I feel like I'm going
to have to reserve these for the summer
time and I probably will declutter one
of them to my friends since they did
send me to by accident but yeah I
purchased this on Amazon I will link
down below where you can pick it up if
you're interested there are twelve
different shades to choose from it is
supposed to have a natural finish which
I really don't feel like it does I feel
like it looks very very caked on the
skin no matter how much you use I've
tried it this week using a very
I tried it on camera with you guys using
a large amount I liked that I got more
coverage with a damped sponge but it did
start to start like crevasse in my nose
basically and also around my fine lines
and wrinkles I just don't like the way
that this wears throughout the day I
have tried it with three different
primers this week at these Stila
aqua globe the BIOS felt russia claw
which is more of a silicon based primer
and then also i tried it with a
hydrating primer or luminous primer
which is the Becca and I just feel like
it didn't look good either way no matter
how I put this on the skin it did not
look good now to be fair I'm having a
little bit of issues with dry skin right
now but I just feel like no matter how
much I moisturize even mixing in oil
with this foundation it just did not
look good on my skin so would not
recommend for those of you with more
mature or dry skin and if you do have
combo skin be careful because this
clings to dry patches so I think that
the coverage is pretty darn good it's
definitely not as good as the pro matte
if you want a really good foundation
with a nice color selection get the pro
matte but yeah this is what the actual
consistency looks like and every single
day that I wore this I really thought
that my skin just looked aged I look
kind of Haggard it got into my fine
lines and wrinkles around my mouth and
my nose crevices everywhere and I just
don't think that it's pretty on the skin
I tried it with lots of different kind
of brushes I do think it applies the
best with a foundation brush kind of
buffing it or pulling in downward
stroking motions on your face I really
like the way it does kind of apply at
first with this tartan on no coal
concealer brush and also any sort of
buffing brush or a sigma tapered you
know what is that the synthetic bristle
brushes things like that the f80 kabuki
whatever I like the way that it first
looks on the skin but throughout the day
unfortunately this really starts to
break down on the skin even if I do set
in my t-zone with like a powder I find
that this is so incredibly drying to the
point where I don't need to actually set
in my cheek area so if you do have
extremely extremely oily skin and you
want a kind of medium buildable coverage
foundation you could check this out but
I would not recommend this for most
people I just feel like the coverage is
very cakey it does start to oxidize a
little bit as you guys can see and I
just don't like the way it sits on the
skin so let me show you how it the
Rimbaud goes on because they do have a
very similar consistency but I like the
shade match of the Rimmel better and I
feel like this
doesn't emphasize pores and texture and
also it has a whole lot more coverage
and it is a better shade match so
overall I would not recommend this
foundation unless you have extremely
extremely oily skin I could not get it
to stay on my skin for 24 hours even my
L'Oreal pro glow lasts longer on my skin
and I'm composting so yeah would not
recommend this got one you guys I don't
think it's a good one I will try out the
new Maybelline cushion foundation for
you guys I know you've been asking but
would not advise picking this up so yeah
that's my quick little follow-up review
thank you so much for joining me and
I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
