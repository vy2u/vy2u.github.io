first impressions follow up review on
these Maybelline Color molten by I
studio duos so they are basically like a
cream product and I did do a first
impressions video on these using these I
put them on my eyes and I'm just gonna
let you guys know today um what I think
of them I've been using them now for
about a week and I've used them pretty
well as you guys can see and I'm going
to let you know if I still have the same
thoughts that i did when i did the first
impressions and yeah so my first
impressions review basically was that um
I'm didn't like love these right away I
really thought they weren't extremely
pig I mean I didn't think they were
payments and I think but I didn't think
that they were easy to work into the
crease or really easy to blend or
anything like that but I now have to say
that I have found that I don't like to
put these in the crease at all i don't
really like to put any cream products in
the crease it's really hard for me to
blend those out so basically what i've
been doing with these is using them as
lip colors and as liners and have really
really like them for that i am using the
pink shade right here all over my lid
today and then i blended a powder
eyeshadow into the crease and then i am
using this plummy color underneath on my
lash line today so i really really like
these for that like juice i like them to
put on the lid I think they look really
good on the lid they stay on really well
they don't crease and I really like them
as um wine artist liners it makes them
really really easy so overall I'm
actually really happy I got these and I
might pick up a few more shades i think
they are worth it um don't expect that
these are going to be super easy to be
blending into the crease or like just
they really because creams are hard to
really blend blend I don't even know why
I keep saying that it's difficult to
sometimes blend cream products into the
crease if you're like me and you maybe
aren't the best at blending sometimes I
find it to be the same kind of like with
my color
shadows it's hard for me to blend into
the crease if you're really really good
with makeup you may not have this issue
at all which is awesome um but I really
found that these just works the best on
the lid for me and also as liners so I
am happy with these i would give these
like an eight out of the ten actually so
i'm going to pick up a few more shades
and yeah i hope you guys enjoyed this
follow up review on the Maybelline Color
molten cream shadow duos if you did took
this video a thumbs up and I'll see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
