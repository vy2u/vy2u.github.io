thank you so much for joining me i hope
you are all having a fantastic day this
video is going to be a quick little
follow-up review on the nerves and
velvet matte skin tint with
broad-spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen that i
actually did a first impressions on a
week ago i will link the original video
down below in the description bark you
would like to see all the you know basic
information on this product and also how
I applied it the shade i have is light 0
taryn way bay and that is what it looks
like and um i will say this packaging is
starting to get real dirty i love the
packaging because it is matt and really
sleek but it's just getting fingerprints
all over it and products stuck to it it
kind of looks like really really warm
down and kind of used up but anyway I
haven't really really enjoyed this
particular little foundation / BB cream
/ skin tint it really has very very nice
coverage if you watch the first
impressions video you saw that I really
like the consistency i thought the shade
match was really nice and i feel like
this does wear an incredibly long time
which is a huge thing for me now it does
not keep me completely matte throughout
the day honestly it is a demi matte
finish i would prefer my Rimmel stay
matte over this as far as like lasting
power and coverage goes if you want to
get this up to like a full coverage
foundation you're going to need about
three to four layers of it is kind of
like light to medium coverage I do find
that it builds quite nicely like that
the layers build nicely on top of each
other but overall this is not a
foundation that I would reach for if I
really wanted like a nice full coverage
sort of look I am wearing it today I do
like the way it looks don't get me wrong
I think it's a very beautiful on the
skin it appears very skin-like but again
I just have other foundations or other
BB creams or tints or CC creams that I
prefer a little more than this one and I
really liked it when I first tried it
out and I still do really really like it
this was one of my holy grails for the
week if you guys watch my fails and holy
grails yesterday but i would say overall
if i were to pick between this one and
like the Rimmel stay matte foundation I
would choose the Rimmel just because I
prefer the cover tickets and I feel like
it does actually keeping that this
actually even though it claims to be
this like a velvet matte skin tint I
don't feel like it keeps me very mad I
do have to
reapply like powder in my teeth on
throughout the day I have combo skin and
I just think it's kind of just like a
basic foundation it just has led to
medium coverage again you can build off
the coverage if you want to but I have
to say I like this it has been a
favorite for me I feel like it's very
lightweight on the skin but if I was
comparing it to all of my other
foundations I don't think it's
incredibly special I will use it during
the summertime of course because it does
give a nice Demi Matt appearance to the
skin but again just you know I was kind
of bummed that I had to go back in every
single time that I was wearing this
including today I had to go back in with
powder and powder out my teeth on since
it claims to be this you know matte skin
tint I do like that has broad spectrum
SPF 30 in here I think that's really
nice i haven't had any um you know
breakouts or anything because of the
actual sunscreen in there it is chemical
sunblock if you are curious but overall
I think it's a good product when I
repurchase know and I think this is
around fifty dollars which i think is
quite expensive so before you look into
this I would look into like the Rimmel
stay matte foundation or if you want
something a little lighter on the skin
look at the it cosmetics CC cream I just
think that that has the same it actually
has a higher SPF in it but I also give
this thing sort of coverage but it's a
lot I don't know it's just a little more
impressive in my opinion v CC cream at
the a cosmetic CC cream instead of this
so yeah I really like the packaging i
like that i have sunscreen in it but i
would not be purchased this is just not
a product that has completely knocked my
socks off so i hope you guys enjoyed
this little follow-up first impressions
on the NARS velvet matte skin tint thank
you for joining me and I will see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
