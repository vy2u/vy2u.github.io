thank you so much for joining me I hope
you're all having a fantastic day in
this video I'm giving you guys a first
impressions follow up a review it
doesn't say that right yes first
impressions follow up review on the
Rimmel London stay matte liquid mousse
foundation the shade that I picked up
was 010 liked porcelain and this claims
to be lightweight and have like shine
control i did a first impressions on
this particular product exactly a week
ago i believe it was exactly week ago
don't quote me on that i think it was
about a week ago and i basically applied
it to my face on camera and i talked
about where i got it and all that kind
of stuff so if you would like to know
like the basic information on this
product i will link that video down
below in the description bar so you guys
can check it out but anyway i'm just
here to give you guys a quick little
follow-up i have been using this product
for a week now and I feel like I have a
really nice understanding of what it's
like so I really really enjoy this I
believe this was around 3 99 or 499
which i think is very very cheap for a
drugstore foundation did you get one
fluid ounce of product in here which is
the standard amount so you're not
missing out on anything and this shade
of light porcelain 010 is really really
nice if you are a fair girl probably
can't tell today I have sunlight coming
in so maybe in like a little tan but it
really doesn't lean too pink and it
doesn't lean to yellow so I really
really like that I feel like a lot of
drugstore foundations especially when
you get into the lighter shades they
tend to go really really pink or really
really yellow so this is a perfect
perfect shade match it is very similar
to the Tarte Amazonian clay full
coverage foundation in the shade fair
beige now let's talk about the
formulation because in that video I did
say I felt like it didn't build on the
skin very nicely and I'll get back to
you the comparison on guitar it's a
foundation in a second but I felt like
this didn't really build on the skin
very nicely honestly this goes on full
coverage in one coat today I'm wearing
it and I kind of shared it out a little
bit I did apply it with a damp Beauty
Blender my Real Techniques sponge and I
just use a really really small amount
and I feel
kind of evened out my skin without
looking too heavy so although this does
claim to be lightweight on the skin I
really don't feel like it is I
definitely can feel that there's
products there however I will say that
this where is so long and it has such
good coverage that I just like I don't
mind I don't mind if it feels heavy on
my skin it doesn't feel super heavy like
the cap on Z lock it tattoo foundation
is not as like cement II feeling is that
10 but this one is just a little heavy
on the skin it's definitely not
lightweight it does help with shine
control for sure I have combination skin
combinations I have combination skin and
I do not find that I have to touch up in
my t-zone throughout the day whatsoever
which is like unheard of because
normally I have to go back in and powder
since I do you get whaley in my t-zone
and dry on the outer perimeters of my
face so it's like one of those
foundations where if you have dry skin
or aging skin you probably want to stay
away if you do want to try it out go
ahead and get a really really nice
moisturizer and a very very hydrating
primer because this is very full
coverage and also it is just it's very
mad it's a very matte not dummy mad very
mad so I think if you do have oily skin
you would love this I know I'm going to
be loving this baby during the
summertime and now let's get back to the
comparison on the Tarte Amazonian clay
foundation I probably should have pulled
it out oh I do have it so here is the
Tarte Amazonian clay full coverage
foundation with broad-spectrum SPF 15
like I said this shade right here from
remotely like porcelain is an exact
identical match to the fair beige um
color in the Amazonian clay full
coverage foundation I was comparing
these when I did the first impressions
because I felt like they were going on
kind of similar they're both kind of
moosie like they have a moose like
quality to them if that makes sense
they're not like liquid so I thought
immediately of this one however I will
say I don't think these are like an
exact Duke are they comparable
absolutely in my opinion this one is way
cheaper and you do get the same amount
of product however I prefer my tart
because I feel like I can build the
coverage on this one without it looking
cakey or emphasizing any sort of dry
patches or weird areas on my face
where's with this one like if I put two
layers of this on it's like I have
wrinkles everywhere big like pores and
just it just looks horrible it clings to
the dry patches it just doesn't look
good so less is more with this product
but I do think that the tart one is
still better again this is one of my top
five favorite foundations ever so I feel
like it's kind of hard to compare but I
did want to do a quick little comparison
because I mentioned that in the first
impressions video but anyway like I said
I think the shade match is really really
nice if you do have your skin and you
want a good like actual shade match for
your skin without it leaning to thing or
too warm or two yellow I would highly
recommend this one again if you have dry
skin or aging skin even sensitive skin
there was something in here when I
brought this around my eye area it's
done a little bit so if you have
sensitive skin if you are sensitive to
dimecaco and I know there is quite a bit
of silicone in this product because of
that moosey texture just go ahead and
check you know check the ingredients
list to make sure that it will work for
you but yeah if you boil easton or combo
skin i think you're going to love this
baby i'm really enjoying it I feel like
it just wears all day long it's lovely i
mean i can feel it on my face but I just
like the way it looks and I mean you
can't beat 399 right so anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed this quick little
follow-up on the Rimmel stay matte
foundation really really loving it I
would definitely consider repurchasing
if I ever got through it ang I will see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
