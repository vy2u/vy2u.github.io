happy Tuesday this particular video is
going to be my first impressions
follow-up review on the Urban Decay all
nighter waterproof long-wearing liquid
foundation and this is supposedly a full
coverage and use a matte finish and
oil-free and I did a first impressions
of this exactly a week ago on my channel
if you would like to see that video I
will link it down below
I applied half of the product with a
damp Beauty sponge which is still my
preferred application 60s later and then
the other side with a buffing brush so
like I said I will link that down below
but yeah it has been a week and I'm here
to give you guys my finalized thoughts
on this so let's get right into it we're
gonna start with packaging you guys I
really hate the packaging on this
product it is extremely cheap and flimsy
feeling so the only thing and I really
really like about it is the fact that it
does have a pump a Hello it is a $40
foundation each should have a pump so I
would say that this is just very cheap
feeling although it looks like it's nice
and weighted I feel like I have
drugstore foundations that come in
better packaging now some people may
want to travel with this it's very very
lightweight like it literally feels like
I could just fly out of my hand at any
second but I prefer to travel with like
stick foundations things like that so I
would not take this for traveling but I
don't know maybe you could see something
good about it but for the most part I
think it's just flimsy alright they
shade that I had picked up it was 0.5
this is the lightest out of I believe 24
different shades we need to talk about
the shade selection really quickly here
because if you saw the first impressions
you saw that this one which is the
lightest shade darkened up quite a bit
on at my skin so it darkens up even more
off camera you guys and right now to
actually match this particular
foundation I went ahead and I did have
to put on a layer of my Jergens
afterglow ultra glow fair - light
version or whatever it's called self
tanner so to get the perfect light match
with my neck and all that kind of stuff
I do have to darken up my complexion to
really really get this foundation to
work for me it kind of sucks good I feel
like it's gonna be more of a summer
foundation for me I love the consistency
I love the coverage I love the formula
in general but they need to work on the
shade selection so if you are going to
pick this up get two to three shades
lighter okay especially if you are in
the more fair category it doesn't matter
if you have the neutral undertone ones
the warm undertones or the pink
undertones I feel like they all oxidize
kinda orangie because this one is
supposed to be a pink undertone and it
oxidizes quite Orange so I just wanted
to put that out there but definitely
definitely pick up about two to three
shades lighter than what your skin tone
is so yeah I would say right now I'm
like a NC 20 with the tanner on and I
just feel like then this is an NC xx
you're curious all right as far as the
formula is concerned like I said it is
absolutely beautiful I love the finish
that it gives on the skin is just oh
it's so stunning you guys so and this is
what it looks like when you first pump
it out it is very very liquidy and you
probably are thinking like what how can
that give any coverage but then you
start to blend it in and you realize
holy that's almost like Estee
Lauder Double Wear kind of coverage not
quite but it's pretty darn good you guys
I think the coverage level is absolutely
beautiful if you do have combo to oily
skin unless it's just gonna be a holy
grail for you because it has that
beautiful Demi matte or semi matte
finish to it it's not completely matte
now when I did my first impressions I
was saying it's completely it's
completely matte no I think it's like a
Dem in matte or dem I'm at Jamie madness
if Debbie matte or semi matte um like
appearance to the skin that's what it
looks like it doesn't completely make
him all flat all over the face so I
think you still could use it if you like
normal more dry kind of skin types I'll
talk about that in a little bit you need
to use like a really hydrating primer
but yes this is beautiful love the
coverage love the consistency love the
way it blends and it does layer very
very nicely as far as where time is
concerned it was incredibly well without
a primer but I did go ahead and try it
out with three different primers this
week the first one was the it cosmetics
feel at the moment this is my favorite
one to pair together with this
foundation and this is a hydrating
primer with a little bit of silicone in
it so I loved the way that the
foundation went on top of that I did not
like the way that it blended in with the
Stila aqua glow perfecting primer this
is more of like a makeup extender and it
just kind of comes in stick form you
paint it onto your face it leaves kind
of like a tacky or sticky feeling so I
would not recommend using this
foundation with anything sticky or tacky
primer wise but another really nice one
is the YSL this is the tushy cloth this
is a beautiful beautiful silicone to
the home primer so again anything is
super hydrating or anything filled with
silicone hurt about the code and this
will go on very very nicely all right
for application methods I would say sir
and looking down I have all these
products in front of me application
methods definitely hands down Beauty
sponge for sure I was going to save the
Beauty Blender no I don't have Beauty
Blender I do the Real Techniques miracle
complexion sponge it is beautiful I love
the way it applies I will take one pump
of this I know that I did apply for in
my first impressions video I just wanted
to see if we could build the coverage
but what pump with this is sufficient or
not for your whole entire face really
nice full coverage so I will apply one
pump of it I kind of dot it all over my
face and then I just tap it in with my
damp sponge and it is absolutely
stunning so really really enjoy that I
think it looks quite streaky with a
brush so just keep that in mind if you
did wash the first impressions I buffed
it in on I think this side of my face
you could see little fine lines and
wrinkles and ass on my little dry
patches so that's something to be aware
of so yeah overall I would say it's a
very very good foundation the wear time
is very good the only time I start to
get really really oily in my t-zone is
way later in the day when I'm home from
work like we're talking like 7 o'clock 8
o'clock and 9 o'clock at night when I
just don't give a anymore you know
it's like nobody's gonna see me so I
think that this does stay relatively
Demi match or semi matte on the skin all
day long really really good if you do
have combination to oily skin or normal
skin if you do want to use it if you
have more mature or dry skin highly
recommend using full-on like heavy duty
moisturizer and then going in with a
very very hydrating primer like this one
or maybe the Too Faced hangover RX
because this can kind of emphasize
certain areas that are dry on your face
but again if you have like combination
to oily skin this is gonna cover
everything that you want covered and it
just glides on beautifully onto the skin
so yeah those are kind of my thoughts on
this particular foundation it's
definitely a bummer that the shade
selection is so poor and then oxidizes
so a much I just cannot believe that
don't really like the packaging up with
the finish and the consistency and the
way it looks on the skin is amazing so I
hope you guys enjoyed this first
impressions first impression yes first
