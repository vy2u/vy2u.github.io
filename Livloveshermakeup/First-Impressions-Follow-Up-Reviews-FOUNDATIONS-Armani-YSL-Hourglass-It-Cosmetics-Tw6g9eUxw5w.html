to my channel today's video is going to
be a first impressions follow up on some
foundations I have recently tried out
for you guys I have done first
impressions on all four of the
foundations that I'm about to show you
so if you would like to see application
as well as like wear tests on these I
will leave those videos down below in
the description bar but I'm here to give
you guys my final thoughts on the a why
of cell fusion ink foundation these
Giorgio Armani luminous silk foundation
the hourglass illusion hyaluronic skin
tint as well as the it cosmetics your
skin but better CC illumination cream so
let's go ahead and jump right into it we
will start with you I Estelle fusion Inc
foundation and this is what it looks
like this does retail for around $60
which is extremely extremely expensive I
battled this against the Giorgio Armani
luminous silk the Giorgio Armani
luminous taupe definitely one in my
opinion but when I look at this by
itself I do think that this is going to
be a foundation that I can use during
the summer time so I will be going ahead
and holding on to it
the shade that I do wear is called a b10
porcelain if you guys are curious and
that is the lightest out of I believe 18
different shades I love the packaging I
think it's beautiful it really does give
a nice matte finish on the skin when you
apply this which I was not really
thinking was going to happen it's a very
liquidy foundation this is what the
applicator actually looks like and not a
huge fan of the applicator but as you
can see super super liquidy and they do
describe it as a water foundation so I
really thought this was gonna give me a
little more of a luminous quality on at
my skin however it actually dried down
very very matte so I am someone who does
have combo to oily skin although I am
very dry this time of year during the
summer time I get extremely oily so I
will be going ahead and holding on to
this I would give it 3 out of 5 stars
by the way this is what it looks like
kind of blended in on the skin and it
does have more of a pinky undertone to
it so there it is
alright so these second a foundation is
the Giorgio Armani luminous silk
foundation I am in love with this I
would give it 5 out of 5 stars and this
is what the actual packaging looks like
it is absolutely beautiful I do plan on
finding you guys a cruelty-free
alternative it does come with a little
pump here and the shade that I do wear
is number two which I believe is the
lightest shade they do not offer a shade
number one but don't get confused here
so you see how it's a very very lip
this actually has amazing amazing
coverage it looks like when you blend it
in it would be similar coverage level to
the why of cell fusion Inc but actually
the coverage level on this is absolutely
insane it gives a very very dull like
beautiful fresh face complexion sort of
look to the skin a lot of coverage and
this particular shade does lean a lot
more on the warm tone side I've heard
from a lot of you that's just the whole
line in general tends to lean a little
more on the warm tone side so if you are
fair complected with a warm undertone I
do think you would enjoy that quite a
bit I did also hear that the shade
number three may be a slight bit lighter
than this one so if you are later in
complexion than I am then maybe you want
to check out the shade number three I
don't know why they're backwards like
that but overall this is beautiful love
the finish on the skin I think it'll be
perfect for me this time of year it
would probably make me a little greasy
during in the summer time so I won't
wear it during the summer but it is a
gorgeous gorgeous foundation for combo
skin or dry skin or normal skin alright
so the next one is the hourglass
illusion hyaluronic skin tint this does
have broad-spectrum SPF 15 and I think
this is pretty darn good I would give
this also I would say 4 out of 5 stars
I'm going to give it 4 out of 5 it is a
really nice product that is very very
easy to put on the skin if you do want
just like a nice tint of you know
coverage on your skin a nice amount of
coverage I do think this is pretty darn
good as you can see it's actually very
very thick so don't get you know don't
get it twisted you guys this actually
has quite a bit of coverage to it as far
as the skin tint is concerned and it may
go on with more of like a matte
appearance but it really does like dry
down with a lot of luminescence kind of
quality to it this particular shade does
leave more on the pink tone side and the
shape that I did pick up is vanilla I
don't think the shade selection is that
great so I would definitely recommend
going in store and swatching ahead of
time but overall I think this is quite
nice it doesn't wear amazingly well
throughout the day it is something that
you definitely want to set in with a
powder especially if you do have compost
skin like I do but if you have very dry
dehydrated skin at mature skin I think
you would really like this if you're
super oily this is gonna be way way way
too slippery for you it's just gonna
slip right off your face but overall it
is quite nice is it worth the price tag
not quite sure I probably wouldn't
repurchase but I would give it 4 out of
5 stars
and finally we have the it cosmetics
your skin but better CC illumination
this is an anti-aging
hydrating cream with SPF 15 sunscreen
I'm sorry 15 not 15 sunscreen in it and
this is not something that I would
repurchase I would get this 2 out of 5
stars I can definitely make it work on
my skin I'm actually wearing it today if
you are curious as to what is on my face
it is this
I do wear the shade fair I don't think
they have that great of a shade
selection but as you can see it is kind
of a nice like full coverage cream it
definitely gives a nice amount of
coverage you only need one pump a little
goes a very long way with this I would
not recommend putting on more than one
pump honestly I would recommend like
applying this with your fingers or a
damp sponge something that's not gonna
be too like it's not gonna like get
stuck in the bristles that make sense
well you want to sponge so that you can
just Pat it onto the skin lightly I
notice like less is much more with this
I don't even know I mean I'm trying to
say what I did say but you guys know
what I did it less is much more with
this it does have glitter particles in
it and the more I applied the worse it
looks on my skin because of those
glitter particles I was really kind of
disappointed because I thought
illumination would mean that it would
have a nice sheen to it but it truly
does have glitter particles which I'm
not into so if you are looking into the
it cosmetics CC creams I would HIGHLY
highly recommend just getting the
original version this is not something
that I find super super impressive but I
will make it work I will use it up but
yeah 2 out of 5 stars so anyway those
are my follow up reviews on those
foundations so far I definitely have
another round of foundation follow ups
for you guys coming soon and yeah I hope
you enjoyed this video thank you so much
for joining me and I'll see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
