welcome back to my channel today's video
was originally going to be look at the
week which is what I do on Saturdays
where I recreates either my most
requested makeup look I was wearing this
week or my personal favorites but
something very exciting happened
yesterday and actually all three of my
Julia Place palettes came in the mail I
ordered these on HauteLook for $19 a
piece a couple of weeks ago and I was
just so super excited that I thought
today we would go ahead and do a first
impressions with the nubian palette
which is the original one this is the
first palette I think they came out with
and I thought I would go ahead and test
this out on my eyes really do a first
impressions for you guys let you know if
I think that this formula is good if it
is worth it
so yeah I will have the unboxing a will
let see here this is going up on
Saturday I'm doing a bunch of pre film
because Tom and I are apartment hunting
in Cleveland if you didn't know we are
moving in 90 days to Cleveland for his
work and also well I found a job there
too so for my work
um but yeah anyway I did buy three of
the palettes like I said the first one
was the nubian palette I also got the
Nubian two and The Masquerade palette so
let me know if you want me to do a get
ready with me featuring these but if you
saw yesterday's video which was on
Friday you would have seen me unbox
these and do some squatches so anyway
let's go ahead and play around with this
one shall we
here is the Nubian a palette I have not
even touched this yet so here it is let
me go inside oh my god it's so beautiful
so I thought we were just go ahead and
play around with this Anna see if I can
create a nice a pretty eye look you guys
know I am just a very basic everyday
friendly kind of makeup girl and I see
so many makeup artists creating looks
with this that I think look absolutely
impeccable but I'm not really someone
that does that kind of stuff so I wanted
to share with you guys if this is
everyday friendly for just the average
everyday girl
so I already did put on at my makeup oh
my god it is so hot in the Beauty room
right now
my makeup is already started to melt off
around my nose and my lip area so please
excuse that and my brows are just like
no today but yeah I'm gonna zoom Faizan
so that we can kind of it dig into these
eyeshadows the first thing I want to do
is curl at my eyelashes with my Revlon
at lash curler and I have already gone
ahead and put eyeliner on I thought
today I would just put on my NYX eye and
eyebrow pencil in the shade white so I
just put that onto my waterline and yeah
let's go ahead and do it I'm so excited
because I hear such good things about
these pallets you guys like such good
things so actually let me just do me off
a little bit okay they're perfect
alright so let's go ahead and jump right
into it I am going to take a morphe end
at 3:30 brush and you don't really have
like a brow bone color in here so I
guess I'm just gonna jump into
transition I'm going to take this one
right here and I am going to a jump into
that tap off the excess and start
working that into my crease with this
brush it's very Orange II I didn't it
doesn't look that orange e in the actual
pan but I'm not getting a bunch of kick
up which is nice and I'm just taking
this into the crease and also on two of
my lid if I want it's not a big deal
look at this brow today like why I gotta
be like that about why you gotta be like
that I feel like it was totally a makeup
fail kind of day as I was putting my
makeup on I was like oh my god this
looks horrible and I was like I should
do the first impressions that's a great
idea
alright so it just kind of blending that
in that seemed to blend pretty darn
easily alright I don't like that there
isn't really like a brow bone shade in
here there's one right here that's a
kind of shimmery but like that's gonna
be too dark for my skin personally so
now let's go ahead and jump in with a
sigma e35 brush and god I don't even
know what to take I'm so excited
I'm gonna take this kind of like a
reddish color here I feel like that's so
pretty so I'm gonna take that on it to
the brush and I tap off that excess and
start working that into the crease
lightly um ah let's see oh looks pretty
I like that color it's a beautiful kind
of like cranberry shade actually those
two shades right here this one and that
was a fail this one and that one really
really reminds me of the violet
boss-like formula and also the violet
boss colors from the Holy Grail palette
the ride-or-die palette and I guess the
Laura Lee appellate as well alright so
I'm just kind of taking that into the
crease doing back and forth kind of
motions oh it's looking slightly patchy
but again I haven't really blended yet
so we'll give it a little bit of time
alright and they do little circular
motions and then also just back and
forth
I'm worried that one looks a little
harsh they're so jumping back with that
morphe brush I'm just going to go ahead
and kind of go back and forth that took
a little bit of the color away right
there but that's okay as long as it
blends I'm fine you guys know I don't
like to spend a ton of time at blending
but I feel like that looks slightly
patchy there I'm gonna kind of lift my
eyebrow up so I can really get into the
socket and see if I can kind of blend
that out we'll see all right so that
kind of faded into a nice orange color
let's go ahead and build that up a
little more taking at that Sigma brush
again I'm just gonna kind of work that
into the crease a little more alright
it's a pretty color
I feel like this palette could give you
a really nice kind of like sunset
looking eyes you guys know what you mean
all right I'm very careful to keep that
in the lower crease make it even fall
out okay I'm getting a little bit of
fall out it's not horrible but it's
definitely there just you guys know all
right back in with that morphe brush Wow
back in it with that morphe brush let's
go back into four circular motions okay
yeah it's a little it's a little weird
looking there on my right eye but that's
okay I think I did better with this one
cuz I kept it really low but it did
start to come down on the lid but that's
okay so far so good I feel like it's
blending pretty well it's not like
amazing but it's pretty good do they
blend as easily as like my violet boss
eyes shadow is I don't think so
but they still look really really pretty
great let's go ahead and do some outer
of V work but first I'm gonna take my
let's just take a dis Charts brush here
I'm gonna pick up any sort of fallout
all right I'm gonna go in it with my
luck C 231 small tapered blending brush
and I'm gonna take this shade now cuz I
really want to do this like nice warm
tone I look so
let's pick that up it seems quite Clary
but that's okay we will try it anyways
and I'm gonna work that into the outer V
and the outer crease area see if we can
kind of deepen it up a little patchy
it's not horrible but a little bit
alright mm-hmm kind of deepening up the
color there it's pretty I like the
colors I think they look beautiful and I
have heard some good things about Julius
place and also some bad things I don't
know if you guys have watched these more
like ranting videos about the brand but
it seems like either you get amazing
customer care or like not so great
customer care so I don't know I mean I
just ordered from HauteLook so I can't
speak on that but I wanted to talk about
that a little bit with you guys alright
I'm getting a lot of fallout with this
shade but it is beautiful it reminds me
of flamethrower
from makeup geek all right now I'm gonna
wipe off that what was this the Sigma
e35 a little bit and then I'm gonna go
in and blend with that brush and we're
just gonna do some circular motions
mm-hmm kind of blend those shades
together like how it's turning out on
the left eye the right eye is just kind
of like no you
all right circular circular motions
please blend blend Bend but yeah I still
have that look at the week video for you
guys so I can definitely put that up I
think I'll just save it for I'll save it
as a backup video it was I created like
a purpley kind of smokey eye for you
guys and I used the Nicole Guerrero glow
kit that was like a pre film video that
I had done I will go ahead and save that
video for a day where I don't have a
video or if I'm sick or something like
that in a lupus flare and I want to
throw something up so don't worry that
videos not gonna go to waste
alright going back to that morphe brush
let's go ahead and just blend at this
upper area right here I feel like I'm
having a very hard time blending this
side over here I feel like I took it a
little too high into the crease right at
the beginning and now it's just kind of
like and not listening to me at all and
it doesn't want to blend so just going
in the forest all right look at this I
don't like that blend I think I just
took it up too high you guys because
this eye looks somewhat good to me
I think it looks okay all right so and
now let's go ahead and tap on a color
onto our lid a lot of fall out there I'm
raising this shade right here super
super pretty the one right above the
shade that we just used I'm gonna put it
right onto my finger and let's just go
ahead and apply that to the lid ooh that
is beautiful it literally just dropped
it into my mouth I can taste it I taste
you palate I taste you all right just
tapping that on it to the lid and we
shall see oh my god I can feel literally
the glitter falling down I probably
should have put this on a brush and then
just foiled it but that is okay all
right let's go ahead and pick up that
fallout quickly should probably use a
little more of a fluffy brush all right
I'm gonna go ahead and blend those again
just see if we can get any sort of
uniform kind of smokey orangie pretty
eye look going on it seems okay it's not
amazing guys are not like whoa it is the
best thing that's ever happened to me
but it looks good good it looks decent
let's take that morphe brush again and
let's go back into that color that we
began with the transition shade and
let's just work that in the upper crease
quickly to help with the blending
process because the blending process is
taking a little longer than I would have
personally liked so we're just putting
that orange color again and just kind of
going in a circular motion so it's going
up a little high now which normally I
don't want to take my eyeshadow all the
way up to my brow but it's okay make it
work all right I guess I'm gonna go in
with that lighter shade this one out
right here and I'm gonna take that
underneath my brow even though I feel
like this is going to be darker than my
skin it's a little bit I'm just gonna
work that right under the brow with that
same brush and then let's go ahead and
do some stuff on our live
- fine shall we so I'm going to foil it
now let's just try it as it is I'm gonna
take my 24/7 blending brush from urban
decay and I'm going to go in with that
shade that we worked in to our crease
that one you know what now let's take a
different shade I'm gonna take the shade
down here which is like a step deeper
than that cranberry shade I'm going to
take it onto the brush and let's see if
we can kind of smoke this lower lash
line out see how that looks
that's a pretty shade - these are very
pretty colors I don't think that there's
a huge amount of difference when you
actually get it on to the eyes but
definitely pretty there's no doubt about
that
I should have done a that taped it I
feel like that would have been really
dramatic and pretty but that's okay
alright so just kind of smudging that
out on the lower lash line
I feel like this did not blend very well
oh I see that that's really bothering me
so I'm gonna take this little guy here's
my Sonia Kashuk number 116 brush and I'm
really gonna work here in small circular
motions cuz it just looks patchy to me
and I want it do not look patty
obviously alright and now I'm gonna go
back to that Urban Decay 24/7 blending
brush let's go in with that shade that
we took on our outer V you know it's a
little glittery but I want to layer it
up so you can get a little bit of
sparkle or sheen going on here little
bit definitely getting a fallout I will
say these more like foil shades have a
lot of fallout kinda reminds me of like
the by Lafosse formula with that DeMatha
cone sort of slip to it but yeah just
wanted to point that out great and then
let's take that shade that we put on our
lid that's just a little bit of that
right here well that didn't show up at
all I feel like it would be best to foil
some of these but I just wanted to see
how they'd go on without having to take
any extra steps alright back in with
that Sigma brush once again very lightly
back and forth here
alright let's go ahead and first of all
get that fallout off and I'm gonna jump
into mascara
I'm gonna take my Bobbi Brown smoky eye
mascara first which looks like this I
have a little exercise sample and it hit
the lower lashes first and then the
upper lashes and then while this is
still wet I'm gonna work a layer of the
l'oreal feline mascara on top that's
just the mascara that i have been using
this week the combination so here's the
feline mascara i'm gonna work again on
the lower lashes first and move on to
the top so we have one coat of each for
a nice definition of length and volume
alright guys so there is the eye look
this took 13 minutes to create which i
think is a little long for me personally
so here is what it looks like Ivan gets
pretty these were a little tough to
blend they feel like the mats were a lot
easier to blend it probably should have
stuck with the mattes I'm the more
foiled DeMatha cone sort of ones we're
really hard to blend especially on this
side I still feel like it looks patchy
but overall I would say it's a beautiful
palette I love the color selection I
think it looks pretty like no doubt
about it
let me zoom you guys out all the way so
you can kind of see what it looks like
but yeah I think maybe it would have
been a little more pretty if I had done
a little bit of tape here and it could
be a little more exact but overall I
think it looks pretty it's a nice kind
of warm toned smoky ish sort of eye but
yeah I would just advise against
bringing those super super foiled shades
in to the crease because it seems like
those are difficult to blend even though
they do have like that to method comb
formula for whatever reason they did
feel a little tough so now I'm going to
go ahead and swatch the shades that I
did I put on my eyes so there they are
as you can see it those first two this
one and this one definitely have that
glitter enos going on and I saw that you
know when I was working them onto my
eyes there they are swatched and I like
the way the colors paired together is
there a huge difference between oh
there's this color there's this color
really but I still think it looks really
pretty so so far so good I will
definitely give you guys final thoughts
on this palette in a week or two and
yeah that's pretty much it thanks for
joining me guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
