ready with me today which is kind of
like look of the week but we are
actually trying out new products to me
today so we're going to try out five new
products the first our skin care um or
skincare items or first the first one is
a skincare item it is these Sephora
green tea exfoliating wipes so many give

also will be giving you my first
impressions on these two Kat Von D
products the first is the kat von d
locket concealer creme in the shade
whiteout and also i will be giving you
guys a first impressions on the new
locket translucent setting powder from
kat von d i also will be trying out a
new mascara to me this is from the
sephora collection or sephora house
brand this is the outrageous of volume
mascara and the last item is the Clarins
instant light lip comfort oil now I
haven't tried this on my lips but I did
swatch it on the back of my hand so yeah
I'm excited to try that out as well so I
basically just give you guys a first
impressions on all of these products and
I will be back in a week to give you
kind of my final thoughts and rundown
but let's go ahead and just start
getting ready shall we the first thing
i'm going to use are these two for green
tea exfoliating wipes their supposed to
be mattifying and alfo anti-blemish so
i'm just going to open these up and take
off the little appeal thing here and we
are going to rub one of these all over
our face and I know that I am NOT doing
look of the week today and that's mostly
just because you guys um you know I've
been a little off oh those are super a
Hutt's like super super exfoliating all
right we're gonna flip it over to the
soft side first and wipe down my face um
but yeah i know i'm not doing look of
the week and that's mostly just because
I've kind of been on and off of my
channel this week just because I have
been sick but i'll be back on Monday
with shop and swatch my stash look at
the week next week and then also of my
fails and holy grails but anyway I am
just wiping down my face these
definitely don't smell as good as the
rose ones but I'm just wiping my face
down with the nice soft side and then
where it does have like the little
exfoliating parts I'm going to go ahead
and kind of rub that in my t-zone area
or I do tend to get a little more oily
but so far I think these are pretty good
they feel like they are definitely
cleansing my face I just feel like this
part here the little um like exfoliating
part it's super super super rough so I
think I prefer the softer side but they
smell ok so just impressions on that
just okay next we are going to go ahead
and I am going to go right in to
foundation now the foundation that I'm
going to be wearing is a my mac studio
sculpt SPF 15 foundation with
broad-spectrum SPF 15 I already said
that I don't know why it says studio
sculpt SPF 15 broad spectrum SPF 15
foundation spf15 this is what it looks
like my shade is NC 15 if you guys are
curious i'm just going to shake that up
really nicely and put a little dollop of
it on the back of my hand and then i am
going to go ahead and take my damp
sponge i am going to tap into there and
we are just going to go ahead and put
this all over the face now this is
definitely a little light for me
currently i am a self tanned but i'm
trying to decide if i want to declutter
this when i do my declutter series in
october so i'm trying to get around to
using it a little bit if that makes
sense you know how before you declutter
you kind of want to try things out again
and be like wait do I really want to
declutter that um yeah I basically have
not been reaching for this so I thought
you know what may be able to declutter
it but that is what it looks like on the
skin I've never really liked the way
that this looked on my skin to be
completely honest with you guys I always
thought it was just I don't know I
always thought it looked kind of weird
is supposed to be very moisturizing I
never thought I was that moisturizing
actually always felt like it kind of
balled up and patched up in certain
areas on my face so I don't know about
this but I will wear it all day today
and then I guess in October you guys
will see if I declutter it or not but
yeah alright so index let's go ahead and
get into another first impressions i'm
going to hold on quite down my lips
first i am going to go ahead and be
mixing this kat von d lock-it concealer
creme in the shade white out with the it
cosmetics neutralizing cream bye-bye
redness now I know a lot of people just
use this for redness around their nose
things like that
we can do that but I also like to use
this under the eyes but my issue is that
it is very very dark for under the eyes
this actually cancels out blue tones
really beautifully so what I'm going to
do is actually take the kat von d first
this is the whiteout concealer creme and
this is definitely like a whiteout shade
so what I'm going to do is put one dot
on my eyelid on each side and then I'm
going to take three dots kind of
underneath my eye and yes I'm kind of
going like this twisting the actual wand
because I don't know how much I should
be putting on this my first impressions
and then I'm going to go in with /
redness and neutralizing cream and I am
just going to take a little bit of this
underneath my eye as well and on my
eyelid and we are just going to blend
that in with the sponge so I'm going to
take the pointed side and we are just
going to blend that see what happens
well that blended really really quickly
and the two of those definitely mix
nicely together I don't feel like that
whiteout shade is too stark white do you
guys see I don't feel like it's too bad
so I want to see if I can kind of build
that up a little bit I heard that it's
super super insanely pigmented which is
why I didn't put that much on but let's
go ahead and do that again I feel like
that covered really nicely though I mean
really really nicely but I'm still going
to do it again so three little splotches
guess they're not really dots whatever
it is that I'm doing and then I'm you
take a little more of the it cosmetics
bye-bye redness which again is quite
dark even with my self tanner but I love
wearing this under the eyes and I just
haven't been able to because i don't
have a white mixer concealer but now I
do so that is very exciting I definitely
feel like that camouflaged the bluetones
under my eyes like instantly and if you
wanted more brightness like I'll have to
play with it a little bit this week but
if I wanted it to be even more bright
I'm guessing that I could definitely go
in with a little more of the actual
whiteout color so that is what it looks
like I actually really like that I think
that looks absolutely beautiful so very
very happy with that so far so good
then I'm just going to blend my
foundation one more time and we are
going to go ahead and first of all I am
going to set my under eye it with the
new translucent powder from Kat Von D so
this is what it looks like this like a
huge thing you guys let's see here 19
grams of product in here which is a lot
and this is what it looks like I just
got fingerprints all over it but we are
going to go ahead and take that little
sticker part off as you guys can see I
definitely have narcotics into this yet
but I have heard really good things and
I'm going to put a little bit into the
lid and then i'm going to set in my
under eye and then i want to set in my
whole face because i'm curious as to how
this will do as far as like setting in
the whole face there's a lot of product
there so what I'm going to do first is
go ahead and take this elf angled blush
brush i'm just going to tap into their
top off the excess very very powdery and
i'm just going to go right underneath
the eye now I don't bake so I'm not
going to try and bake with this i know
most people do like to think with this
i'm sure that you could definitely go
ahead and do that i mean it seems like
that's what most people are doing with
this but for me personally i like a
loose powder for setting my under eye
area and also i just like powder in
general for you know setting in my
t-zone and all of my oily spots so i'm
just setting right underneath the eyes
so far it looks pretty good it's getting
all over my shirt it looks pretty good
as stuff we not taking up underneath the
eye area which is very very nice
especially when you are wearing such a
full-coverage concealer like that
whiteout creme I feel like it definitely
could get cakey but it actually looks
really good all right I like that so far
doesn't look like there's powder on me
and next I'm going to take my bu a
beautifully pro flat kabuki brush and
I'm going to dip into their and then
we're going to set in my face I me know
a lot of people were like oh you
shouldn't use this for said and get your
face makeup but actually if you read on
the actual sephora website it says that
this was technically made to actually
set in your face makeup so i don't know
what everybody is talking about when i
know that a lot of people like to bake
but i don't know i said that in my last
video that i was going to use it to set
in my foundation
people were like no you're not supposed
to do that and I was like um what all
right so i am just tapping this on it's
definitely very very messy just like any
sort of loose or translucent powder it
might be better at being like a
finishing powder but it's definitely
setting in my face very nicely it
doesn't look too bad on my skin I don't
feel like it looks like there's tons of
powder on there I'm just kind of
stippling but I feel like this would be
better as like a finishing powder kind
of like I use my a cosmetic / pours all
over my shirt kind of like how i use my
8 cosmetics bye bye pores you guys know
how I really really kind of go in there
and I like to buff that into my skin I
feel like this would do the same sort of
thing so it looks okay on the face I
definitely prefer it around the eye area
so that's probably what i'll use it for
but that was good to try out anyway then
i'm just going to grab this little
hourglass pallet here from last year i'm
going to take this shade right here
which is like a blush shade that one
right there which is called mood
exposure and we're just going to put a
little bit onto my cheeks with the same
brush just so that i have a little bit
of color in my face so so far those
three products were pretty darn good i
mean these two four waves for okay i
definitely prefer the rose ones which
are the ones that i have tried before I
feel like the cap on deeds locket
concealer creme was really nice I liked
the way that that mixed with my darker
concealer here which is nothing i'm
trying to use up in 2016 so i really
want to get through this but it's just
so darn dark so I feel like that mixed
really nicely quickly I'm going to go in
with a little bit of let's see here
which one is this this is diffused light
which is like a highlight or just like a
setting powder and I'm just going to hit
the high points of my face but I really
do like the way that that went on I
thought that looked very very nice so
that's good any setting powder not like
super thrilled with it right away but I
like the way that it looks underneath of
the eyes again I don't think it looked
amazing to set in my whole face it looks
slightly kinky yeah now that I look
really like up close it does look
slightly cakey
on my face but not around my eyes which
is great alright gonna put my little
mirror back right there sorry if I'm
moving the camera I'm just going to wipe
my lips down really quickly and we are
going to go ahead and try out that lip
oil so I did do swatches of this the
other day when I actually hauled it is
the clarins instant light lip comfort
oil the shade I got a 02 raspberry but I
have not put it on my lips yet so let's
go ahead and put this on has a huge huge
huge applicator ooh huh wow that is
actually a lot stickier than I thought
it was going to be usually lip oils are
kind of light this is actually kind of
thick hmm it definitely smells like
raspberry when I first got it I thought
I smelled like floral something but now
it smells like raspberry that is the
color the color is beautiful it's
insanely gorgeous i'm all about like
that light flush of color on your lips
mmm tastes really good it definitely is
a little stickier than i thought it
would be it's not like tacky but you
feel it there on your lip so that's kind
of interesting like i said i'll be back
in a week to give you guys my final
thoughts and now let's go ahead and do
with the mascara so we have the sephora
outrageous Volume Mascara right here I
picked this up a few weeks ago and I'm
going to put it on so this is what the
wand looks like it's crazy looking and
I'm just going to take my hair right
here actually so then I don't get this
everywhere but you guys know I love the
Sephora outrageous curl mascara so I'm
excited to try this one out and it looks
pretty promising right away I feel like
that's looking pretty good so I don't
have anything on my eyes I just wanted
to put this mascara on and that's just
one coat I like that can you guys see
that I like that I like that a lot it's
definitely more of a wet formula but I
think it looks nice I do oh girl I seem
to love all of these sephora house brand
mascaras so there is one layer of that
mascara i think that's pretty good let's
do
second layer by the way sometimes when
you get these little like sample sizes
does that ever happen were just like
breaks off of the thing right there like
it doesn't actually twist open that has
happened like three times with me before
it's okay like there's nothing wrong
with it I mean it's broken but at the
same time it's not like it dries out
quickly or anything like that it's just
weird like the thing won't open does
that make any sense I have no idea if
that makes any sense okay so the one is
definitely really big and I almost just
poked my eye out but I like the volume
and thickness that I'm getting I think
that looks really really nice it's
actually giving me a lot of length to
which of the outrageous curl mascara
gives me a huge amount of curl and links
and I did not even curl my eyelashes and
I feel like I'm getting a lot of curl
here too so there is two coats of that
mascara so cool first impressions on
some of these products I guess we'll
start with the Sephora wipes I think
these are just ok definitely not my
favorite against the rose ones if i were
to repurchase i would get the rose first
impressions on the lip oil really like
this feels really good on my lips it's
definitely a little more of a thick
formula thicker than the YSL thicker
than the lancome juicy shakers and
thicker than the Physicians Formula one
that I have but it feels very very
nourishing and nice first impressions on
the void out concealer love this I
thought it went on beautifully it didn't
get cakey at all it has a lot of
coverage but it still remained really
nice especially when I did mix it with
that particular concealer or that
particular anti redness thing as far as
the powder is concerned not my favorites
I think it does set in the under eye
area quite nicely it does have a little
bit of a yellow tint to it and I know
it's translucent but it does have a
little bit of a yellow tint you do get a
lot in here but I feel like the Cody air
spun powder is very similar to this so I
don't know if I would repurchase that
and first impressions on the actual
mascara I like this I think it looks
good so anyway I'll be back in about a
week to give you guys up my final
thoughts and yeah I hope you enjoyed
this video thank you for joining me and
I'll see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
