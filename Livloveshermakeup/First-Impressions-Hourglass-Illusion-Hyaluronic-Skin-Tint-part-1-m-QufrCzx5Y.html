to my channel today I am testing out the
hourglass illusion hyaluronic skin tint
for you guys this video is going to be
part one which is the application and in
eight to ten hours I will be back from
work and I'm going to share with you
guys how this wore throughout the day
and that will be part two so anyway
let's go ahead and get started on some
background information on this
particular foundation this does retail
for $56 on these sephora.com website as
always I will link down below in the
description bar where you can pick it up
if you are interested there are twelve
different sheets to choose from I don't
feel like the shade selection is that
great the latest shade is called vanilla
which is the one I picked up if this
does have a linked color to it too with
a cool undertone and the darker shade is
called sable which is supposed to be a
medium tone with a neutral undertown now
I do have a friend at work who has a
very deep complexion she tried to pick
this particular product up and
unfortunately when they did color match
her at Sephora for the sable shade it
looked very ashy on her she told me so I
just wanted to give you guys a heads up
on that this is supposed to give a
medium to full coverage with a radiant
and natural finish it is also supposed
to smooth out fine lines wrinkles and
sagging skin while up boosting Amoy stir
levels throughout the actual day so this
particular product is formulated without
parabens sulfates and satellites it is
free of fragrance and if you didn't know
hourglass is a cruelty free brand so
here is what the actual packaging looks
like it's a really nice kind of dark
chocolatey box typical kind of hourglass
I don't love when they do the dark
chocolate box but that's just my opinion
the actual product doesn't come in like
a dark chocolatey kind of packaging but
anyway you do get one fluid ounce of
product in here and you do have
broad-spectrum SPF 15 the SPF in here
does appear to be both physical and
chemical some blocks like a mix so here
is what the actual packaging that looks
like I do like this I feel like it's a
nice little squeezy - which i think is
good I personally like a pump or a
squeezy tube when I do apply a
foundation just because I feel like you
can get out the exact amount that you
want so I'm gonna go ahead and take off
of the little seal right here and we
shall just go ahead and get started if
you guys didn't know I am going to go
ahead and apply primer on half of my
face I'm going to put it on the right
side and then I will be putting this
particular foundation or skin tint on on
the right side with my Real Techniques
brush and then
on the other side I will be blending out
with a damp sponge this is the Ulta
brand stamp sponge and if you didn't
know you can get a pack of two of these
for $10 at Ulta I do also have my elf
tone correcting powder in the shade cool
a handy just in case I do feel like I
want to go ahead and set that in or this
particular tint in so I did also choose
out a morphe angled foundation brush to
kind of Pat that in but yeah we'll see
how this goes so I have already gone
ahead and put on my skincare if you are
seeing any sort of like lightness or
shimmery kind of thing going on here
under my eyes that is just my ginseng
refreshing eye cream form origins it
just has a little bit of a sheen to it
so let's go ahead and get started I'm
gonna put on my primer first this is the
Bobbi Brown a vitamin enriched to face
base this is what it looks like and I'm
going to apply that to half of my face
so that we can see if wearing a primer
makes any sort of difference with this
particular foundation now I'm also going
to go ahead and apply this primer around
my eye area because when I am testing
out a foundation if it doesn't have like
a concealer that goes with it I do like
to go ahead and take it around my eye
area to see if it can cover up any sort
of fine lines and also blue tones that
are underneath there so I'm just going
to apply that I do like this primary
because I feel like it's not too
silicone base and it's also not too
hydrating it's not too mattifying it's
just right in between so we shall see
how this wears with that alright so
let's go ahead and just put a little bit
on to our finger and we will start like
I said I do wear the shade of vanilla
which is the lightest one so I am just
going to apply this it came out really
kind of gray with a little bit of a pink
undertone and it is a very very thick
consistency I actually was not thinking
that was going to happen so we will
start with the left side of my face I'm
just going to go ahead and dot this on
first and I am going to blend it in with
the damp sponge
like I said so yeah it definitely seems
to be kind of a different consistency a
lot of people were telling me that this
is very very similar to the Real
Techniques I mean not the Real
Techniques goodness gracious this is
very very similar to the actual
complexion rescue cream but from bare
minerals but I feel like this came out a
lot thicker and a lot more mousse like
and it
here's a little more matte on the skin
like right when I'm applying it so I'm
just blending this in with my damp
sponge let me fix my mirror here okay
all right so that will end it in really
really quickly again this is more of a
tint it's not supposed to be like a
full-on foundation but I do want to
build and see what it actually looks
like on the skin so there is the side
that I have not done anything to and
obviously here is the side that I
applied they team or the foundation too
let's go ahead and build that up just a
little more I want to put a little more
around my eye area so I'm going to go
ahead and pack that underneath and on my
eyelid and then also on the areas where
I do have some active breakouts it is
that time of the month lucky me
but perfect time to test out a
foundation right okay so I'm going to go
ahead and blend that in again and we
shall see the shape match looks pretty
darn good it came out a little on the
darker side I hope it doesn't oxidize
throughout the day but I will check in
with you guys again in about 8 to 10
hours and we will see if it oxidizes but
yeah that is going on really really
nicely in my opinion I hope you guys can
see that I think it looks very very
pretty it definitely seems to have a
little bit of moisture to it I know it
looks super oily over here it's just the
sunscreen I was wearing but I feel like
that looks really really pretty on the
actual skin so that is quite exciting
all right I'm gonna go ahead and apply
it on the other side and then we will
blend that and with a brush I do feel
like I'm going through this kind of
quickly because I don't know a lot comes
out at once but it doesn't seem to look
cakey on the skin which I do actually
appreciate so again I'm gonna take that
underneath my eye area as well it looks
kind of funny in the viewfinder alright
and we will just go ahead and blend that
out now with the brush I'm going to take
it downward so Iping emotions and we
will see if I prefer the sponge side or
this side I can already see it getting a
little streaky here so that's just
something to be aware of I'll also go
ahead and do a little bit of circular
motions to see if we can buff that into
the skin more but it is kind of covering
up the dryness that I had around my lip
area if you guys didn't know I've been
having some
raisa surround my lips which is kind of
crazy it really is quite unflattering as
a flutist to have psoriasis on my lips
alright so there it is up close I can
feel around this eye that the sunscreen
is starting to sting a little bit which
is not that great that is okay I don't
like the way it looks with the brush I
feel like I have more coverage over here
but you can definitely see there is some
streaking going on and it definitely is
emphasizing like my pores so I'm going
to finish it off with the sponge again
on this side you definitely can see that
that is going to be my preferred
application method to each their own if
you do prefer a brush that's great but
for me I usually do prefer a damp sponge
and at this particular sponge right here
you guys is quickly becoming my favorite
sponge this little Ulta one I really
love the Real Techniques sponge and I
really really you know enjoy this one
but I don't know I feel like this one's
coming in at number one okay so I feel
like it is darkening up a little bit I
don't know if you guys can see that I
think it's very very subtle but you
don't even see there's a sheen to my
skin which i think looks kind of pretty
I do like that and yeah alright guys so
I think that is pretty good as far as
coverage is concerned I would say this
is definitely a medium coverage not full
like they claimed I'm sure that if I
kept building maybe it would look more
full but I'm a little worried I'm going
to get a little too greasy if I keep on
a building even though my skin is
combination and I'm a little more dry
this time of year I just don't want to
take any chances so we are going to go
ahead and I do want to set the Santa I'm
looking at it right now it does have
that natural sort of radiant look to it
and for my combination skin I just think
I do need to set it in so again I'm
gonna take my ELF tone correcting powder
and you shade cool and I'm gonna take
that morphe angled foundation brush and
I am just going to stipple this on
really kind of focusing first in my
t-zone
usually when I wear a primer and also
when I do wear a powder it just helps to
you know make the foundation last longer
for me personally unless I'm worried a
really really dry and foundation I
always set my actual face in with a
powder that's just how I roll
all right so it stopped stinging over
here which is good sometimes when I do
put on products that have a strong SPF
in them they really do kind of sting
around the eye area should have thought
about that first but I really wanted to
see how would cover around the eye area
and I got about 4 hours of sleep last
night and I feel like it did cover up
the blue tones there so that's pretty
good all right so the actual finish is
obviously changing a little bit now that
I am putting the powder on it definitely
looks a little more matte but it feels
really good it feels very very soft with
the powder on top of it when you know I
had just put the product on it looked
like maybe it was gonna be a little
tacky on the skin I personally do not
like a techy kind of foundation I just
feel like it feels strange on my skin
throughout the day so really liking the
way that this looks I hope you guys can
see but I feel like it looks very very
pretty and natural on the skin it
definitely you can still see little
pimples and things like that popping
through but I think it gives a really
nice look to the skin so anyway guys
that is pretty much it I will be back to
do part 2 hold on okay I will be back to
do part 2 I'm in about 8 to 10 hours if
you guys didn't know I am a teacher so I
will be running around with kids all day
today and right now if you are curious
the time is 9 13 in the morning I do not
have to be at work until 10 a.m. so I'm
gonna put the rest of my makeup on and
then I will be back probably around 5 or
6 to let you guys know how this were
throughout the day so yeah so far so
good I think it looks really nice it
isn't clinging to any sort of dry
patches on my face right now
it didn't really cover up a lot of like
fine lines or blur out my fine lines
like it said it would underneath my eyes
but I think for the most part it looks
quite good so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and I will see you for part 2
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
