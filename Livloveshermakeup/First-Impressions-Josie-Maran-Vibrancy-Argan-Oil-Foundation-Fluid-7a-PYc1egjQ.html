thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having an absolutely
fantastic day I am here to do a first
impressions on a new foundation from
Josie Maran I ordered this foundation
before I left for my trip but I wanted
to make sure that I filmed it when I had
my ring light and all that kind of stuff
because of course I'm doing a first
impressions and I thought it would only
be right for me to have all my good
lighting and a good camera so I have had
this for a while but I have not opened
it I have not used it this is the Josie
Maran a vibrancy foundation fluid this
was a $45 on the Josie Maran comm
website I will link below in the
description bar where you guys can find
it if you are interested they have a
nice like shade selection in my opinion
and you know I am always complaining
about shade selection so I feel like
they have a pretty decent shade
selection but I was just so excited to
get my hands on this look at the outer
packaging on this how gorgeous is that
bottle and then the actual box looks
like this which is also gorgeous it's
like a beautiful kind of shiny gorgeous
metallic e rainbow box like the light
just hits it from every angle it's
absolutely stunning and obviously it did
take it out of the box that I have not
even washed this on my hand I have not
done anything with this so the shape
that I picked up was the shade dynamic
and it does say to shake well and we're
just gonna put this on camera I will go
ahead and apply it and then I will see
if I need to set it with any powder I am
going to start by applying it with my
fingers and if for some reason I'm not
liking the way that that looks I will go
in with my damp Beauty sponge split my
deaf beauty funds which is from Real
Techniques because I feel like damp
Beauty sponges are like the way to go
with foundations but when I'm doing a
first impressions I don't want any
primer on I don't want any concealer on
nothing like that and I just want to see
how well this can cover and do you have
a little set here you know what it's not
a level set I have a monster right here
on the side of my face so I'm really
excited to see how well this particular
foundation can cover and let me read a
little bit about what it says this is
fragrance free dermatologist tested
clinically tested and allergy tested and
has argan oil in it which I feel like is
going to be amazing
those of us who have combination dry
aging skin we're really gonna love this
and argan oil is clinically proven to
significantly improve skin hydration and
smoothness and to visibly reduce coarse
lines and wrinkles in just four weeks
83% of users said their skin felt and
looked more supple radiant and smooth
after using of this product which is
really really cool
they have another clinical trial on the
back here I won't read that but I just
want to read a little bit about what
this foundation is supposed to be like
it says activate your skin's health and
vitality with vibrancy argan oil
foundation fluid for the first time ever
and with great intention we have created
an unparalleled skin care foundation
fluid powered by a hundred percent pure
argan oil using a revolutionary
cold-pressed process to preserve the
hand-selected ingredients a vibrancy
feeds and energizes your skin with the
essential nutrients it creeps
the lightweight medium to full coverage
formula is carefully curated carefully
curated for sensitive skin and designed
to interact and adapt to the movements
of your skin with delicate fluidity for
a vibrant smooth supple baby skin finish
that is alive with energy and color so
vibrant so good alright so high claims
for this product it really is saying
that it is going to give you medium to
full coverage like you can build it up
and also just knowing that there's argan
oil in here I feel like it is going to
be somewhat glossy on the skin not so
much glossy but it's going to have a
little bit of Sheen there you know a
little bit of Sheen because there is oil
in there and it just says it's going to
be a vibrant smooth supple and make your
skin look amazing so yeah let's try it
out let's see if it actually holds up to
those claims I'm gonna go ahead and put
my little headband on and if you guys
are not familiar with my first
impressions like a videos
I personally don't edit my video so I
can't check in with you guys throughout
the day nor do I want to do that that's
just not really my style I prefer I feel
like you need some time with a product
not just one day to say like if you like
it or not so what I personally like to
do is I will put this on camera with you
guys and we'll see if it needs to be set
with a powder I have pulled out my ELF
tone correcting powder and
which is like my ride-or-die Holy Grail
setting powder that works with every
foundation and if I feel like I need to
set it I will set it with that like I
said it will be applying it with my
fingers I have I don't have any makeup
on I don't have any primer or skincare
anything on it just took all of my
makeup off with my micellar water and
yeah basically what i will do is i will
apply this on camera will see if it
needs some powder will take a look at it
up close will see what it looks like and
then a week from today i will come back
and i will give you guys my final
thoughts on the product so i will give
you a full review on it i'm just not
someone who thinks that you can make
your mind up about a product in one day
i do believe you can make your mind up
about a product in one week though so
anyway some people may agree with that
some people may not say no a lot of
people say like with skincare you know
it takes six to eight weeks i believe
that also but at the same time my
particular skin i can tell in a week if
my skin is going to like something or
not so that is how i do of my first
impressions reviews here on youtube if
you are curious so anyway look at this
bottle you guys like girl love it so
let's just open it up it opens up like
this and it has a gorgeous little pump
and like I said my shade is dynamic it
says to shake well so let's shake it up
and then I'm just going to put a few
this looks like it's gonna be beautiful
I'm shade match that is what the
consistency looks like it's pretty
pretty fluid like and I'm just going to
dot this all over my skin and I want to
try and apply it with my fingers just to
see what it looks like um and if for
some reason I don't like it wow this is
a really actually quite light foundation
which is lovely because I'm constantly
complaining about oh it's got a
interesting smell but it's a very very
light like the shade is actually very
light which is kind of nice because I
have been complaining about foundations
being too dark on me lately just I don't
know from everyone like Becca and Tarte
and everyone so it's nice to see that
Josie Maran has really catered to those
pale girls because I think this is
actually probably a shade or maybe half
a shade too late for me so
that's actually kind of cool so I'm just
putting this on with my fingers I'm
putting it all over my eyelids around my
eyes everything because I'm not gonna go
in with concealer so I want to see what
kind of coverage I can get there's my
little monster on my face and I feel
like it's covering somewhat well I don't
like the way it's going on is getting a
little streaky so I'm gonna go ahead and
pull in my trusted Beauty sponge this is
my Real Techniques um like a beauty
sponge and it is damp so I'm going to
start applying that on the other side of
my face and let's see if I like that
better it takes a really specific
foundation for me to enjoy it's like
being applied with my hands so yeah I
think this looks a lot nicer applied
with the sponge I think you do get more
coverage with your fingers but at the
same time I like it to finish better
with the sponge so I'm just dabbing this
on all over and we want to see what it
can cover beautiful shade match I mean
it's not a perfect shade match for me
I'm just saying if you are a pea old
girl yes good job Josie Maran I don't
think I've ever tried a foundation from
Josie Maran so I'm really really curious
um so I I mean a little dryness around
this area right here which is where I
have that big planet and growing on my
face who knows what that is
I mean seriously it looks like a planet
I do like a little dryness around it and
it's actually been a little emphasize
which is kind of strange because I know
that this product does have argan oil in
it but for the most part my skin looks a
very very smooth and pretty and kind of
glossy so I'm going to go back in this
is the first layer and I'm gonna go back
in and do another layer so I'm just
doing another three pumps because I want
to see how this can build they say it
can be you know medium buildable full
coverage so let's see if it actually can
I think it can right away I'm seeing
good potential here I think the only
thing that worries me right away is the
fact that it has oil in it I'm thinking
uh-oh is my t-zone gonna like that I
personally have combinations
again and my teeth on it may not like
that but I don't want to just give it a
day you know I want to spend this week
with it and then I will let you guys
know in exactly a week what I think of
it and how it wore I do think with two
layers it's getting a little glossy
asking a little dewy looking and
personally I'm gonna need to go ahead
and set this I would say with one layer
it actually looked quite nice maybe I
wouldn't have had to set one layer but
with two I'm thinking I'm definitely
going to have to get a little streaky
around my nose I don't really know
what's going on there I know that I am a
little dry around my nose right now but
you would think because there's argan
oil in here there wouldn't be any sort
of problems okay I do still have a
little bit left I'm gonna go onto like
the pointy side of the sponge and just
focus that on my eyelids and my under
eye area
see if that can cover my dark circles
from my three and a half hours of sleep
last night I think it does a really nice
job at that actually it's really
covering redness nicely I think it did a
somewhat decent job with the little
planet on my face I hope you guys know
I'm joking around when I say planet weed
become good friends he's been hanging
out with me for a while now let's see
here so yeah really really dewy really
beautiful again the shade is a little
light for me so I'm thinking what I
would do is I will set it with my tone
correcting powder which will make it
look even more white however I would
definitely go in with like a bronzer or
a darker powder on top of it to make
sure and that everything is blending
into my skin nicely and I just got so
used to grabbing the lightest shade of
every single foundation so I mean I
don't know I'm really happy to see that
Josie Maran created this gorgeous
gorgeous super super light foundation
for the really pale girls out there
because this is even a little light on
me so I'm gonna let that sit there for a
second
ooh my lips I want to see if it can kind
of set I'm getting the feeling that this
foundation doesn't really set if you
catch my drift I feel like it does
state rather glossy on the skin that's
just what I'm a little seen and what I'm
feeling on my face I could be wrong but
let's take a look here so I feel like it
is I don't want to say it's clinging to
dry area if you do have a little dryness
around that pimple it's like one of
those horrible pitbulls where it's like
a big pimple and then like dryness
around it it did cling a little bit
there but it's not clinging anywhere
around my fine lines or wrinkles it is
clinging to my dry ass lips so let's see
yeah it's clean a little bit to dry
areas but it's nothing horrible I think
it looks very fresh and luminous and
pretty like it looks like pretty skin
you know it looks nice I like the way it
looks I have a feeling like I said that
it's not going to completely set it kind
of has this glossy finish to it so I am
gonna go ahead and set it with my tone
correcting powder and cool from ELF
with my it cosmetics boogie buffing
brush I'm gonna go into that product and
then I'm just going to stipple this on
to my face but I can set this in I feel
like the finish is actually really
really beautiful but I worry about it in
my t-zone so technically I could just
powder it up in my t-zone and we can see
what that looks like I feel like that
would be one way of doing it is just
have it powdered in my t-zone however I
I don't know I worry about this
formulation with the argon oil moving a
little bit on my cheeks as well so I'm
gonna go ahead and set it there as well
so you can see now that the finish is
changing a little bit more it's kind of
like a demi matte instead of like that
luminous kind of glossy look it's not
it's not as beautiful as it is just
naturally I like it like I like that
kind of glossy luminous a dewy look I
think if I were to wear it like that I
would be needing to wear like a
mattifying powder or primer with it
something that definitely mattifies
before I put my foundation on just
because I know that that will move on my
face throughout the day especially
during the summertime and especially in
my t-zone but now it's kind of like a
demi matte
finish and I look really really pale now
but it is you know what it's really
beautiful on the skin I think it looks a
lot more beautiful when you don't set it
with powder not gonna lie um I prefer it
when it's not set with powder but I
still think it looks pretty when it is
set with powder so overall I think this
is a very nice foundation I definitely
think that it is living up to the claims
of that kind of medium to buildable slow
coverage I feel like I definitely got a
nice amount of coverage out of here with
two layers hold on one second I know my
lips are gonna be looking very strange
but anyway I feel like it is definitely
is almost full coverage I'm not wearing
any concealer or primers or anything
like that and I do like the way it looks
it's kind of like a demi matte sort of
finished on my skin right now when I set
it with powder but I think it looks even
more beautiful when you just leave it as
is so you put it on the skin and then
you just set powder in the areas where
you need it so that is probably how I
will be wearing it I would be bringing
it just straight up and then powdering
over my t-zone where I need it but
overall I'm pretty darn impressed I
think this is beautiful a wonderful
wonderful shape match I mean personally
for me this is the little light I
probably could go down one shade or even
mix this with maybe like a liquid
illuminator like the NARS one or
something like that to darken it up a
little bit which is like so fun for me
to say I never get to say that I'm
always like oh I have to go get my white
mixer foundation but yeah I think this
is wonderful beautiful beautiful
packaging I love the little rose gold
pump right there I love the bottle it is
glass and it's it's a beautiful
foundation it doesn't remind me of like
a water-based foundation it's not that
liquidy and it doesn't remind me of like
a serum foundation where you kind of get
that silicone nice lip to it it just
feels skin like and nice on the skin I
don't know how to explain it it doesn't
feel like I have tons and tons of
product on even though I did put quite a
bit if I'm
sh'mon it just feels and looks really
beautiful on the skin so I have high
hopes for this product I will be back in
a week to let you guys know if I really
do truly like it and my favorite ways to
apply it and things like that so yeah
thank you so much for joining me for
this first impressions on the new josie
maran
vibrancy fluid foundation and I will see
you guys in tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
