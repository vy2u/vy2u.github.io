my channel today's video is going to be
a first impressions on the new Kat Von D
lolita eyeshadow plus blush this is a
very very limited edition exclusive kind
of thing I did pick it up for $19 on the
Sephora comm website and it will be
available in stores on June 15th so if
you do want it I would highly recommend
marking your calendars I trust Kat Von D
and I trust her brand I feel like they
have good ethics so I believe her when
she says this is limited edition you
guys know me for the most part I'm just
like limited edition my ass but I feel
like this is this is limited edition so
if you do want it I would highly
recommend going in stores and picking it
up on the patina but yeah Kat Von D is
cruelty free I believe this eye shadow
single right here is vegan I was super
excited to get it because I love the
shade at Lolita I actually used to own I
think two liquid lipsticks in Lolita and
then I had the little mini Lolita too
and now I don't wear liquid lipsticks
anymore so I decluttered those but I
would love I would love if they were to
release like a tinted lip balm in the
lolita shade or even like a lip oil but
I feel like Capaldi will never do that
cuz she has that really long wearing
kind of makeup like that's just kind of
her thing like the you know lock it sort
of thing going on so anyway I don't feel
like she'll ever do that but a girl
country right so anyway I thought we
would test this out - this is 3.2 grams
of product which is a very small amount
for a blush but a huge amount for an
eyeshadow single I do own it three of
the eyeshadows singles and I can tell
you they take forever to get through
they really are worth the 19 20 dollar
mark so let me show you what the actual
packaging looks like that is the actual
packaging you open it up and here is the
color so the color is like kind of like
a rosy brownish chestnut color it's
absolutely stunning and I feel like this
one looks a little more cool toned then
they liquid lipstick I just remember
wearing the liquid lipstick it looked
very red on me so I don't know if this
will pull more of red colors on me but
this one does look a little more cool
tone so anyway let's go ahead and test
this out you guys I want to put it on my
maybe on my lips I want to put it on my
cheeks for sure and my eyes
and yeah I do already have all of my
makeup on pretty much I have my eyebrows
on I have a foundation concealer all
that kind of stuff I do have the Kat Von
D first light priming filter and not Kat
Von D the Beco first light priming
filter on as my face primer and at the
L'Oreal magic decreases my actual eye
primer and I just want to see how this
will go on so let's go ahead and jump
right into it I'm going to take my up
and up a blush brush from Target this is
just stained it is completely clean I'm
going to go ahead and dip into here and
I'm so scared you guys because these
kind of colors these kind of colors on
my super fair skin look very blotchy and
muddy and just not super flattering so
we're going to see how this actually
goes on and see if I can kind of blend
it out but I already kind of know this
is going to look a little patchy on me
just because I am fair complected it's
so dark it's so dark
I cannot imagine using this as an actual
blush you guys from me but if you have
like a medium or deep skin tone I feel
like this would be a beautiful blush so
I'm just kind of putting it on you can
already see super super patchy again I
don't think it has to do with the
formula because I have tried out the
thunderstruck single shadow as an actual
highlight before and that worked out
just fine for me I tried that out in
store so I wouldn't say it's necessarily
the actual formula I just think the
color is just a little dark for my fair
complected skin so now I'm just kind of
blending it out a little bit with this
Nicole conceal EO torch brush now this
is a stained again it's clean but it's
stained so I'm just going to go ahead
and blend that in circular motions you
guys can probably already see it looks
very patchy again I'm guessing it's
because of the color it's very hard with
these kind of like chestnut brown sort
of colors to get that to work on fair
skin it's just very very very very
difficult so I'm just going to go ahead
and blend that out and see what we can
do here but you know super super dark
would not wear this as a blush on an
everyday basis that so many of you are
asking you to try it out as a blush on
camera so of course that is what I am
doing I definitely recommend using
something a little more fluffy
it's not that it's like hideous it's
just very much there so if you love like
a really in your face kind of blush this
will be great for you but for me with my
fair complected skin even though I'm
self tandra and I was a little too much
obviously so I'm just gonna continue to
kind of blend a little bit and yeah
that's how it looks very very out there
a little too out there for me but it is
a deep chest many kind of pinky rosy
tone I feel like I have clown face right
now but you guys asked me to try it out
so anyway let's continue on we're gonna
go ahead and try this out on the eyes
I'm gonna take a wet and wild crease
brush I'm just going to dip in here
lightly and then I want to work that
hopefully lightly into the crease okay
not so lightly I'm going to take that
down onto the lid as well let's just see
if we can kind of blend this together
okay you know I'm not working with any
sort of transition I'm not working with
anything I literally just want to use
this for practically everything on my
face I will put on eyeliner and mascara
but I didn't want to use any other
shadows so we're just gonna go with this
kind my cheeks my cheeks my cheeks mud
cheeks all right so this definitely
looks a little more red on me but Lolita
like the original liquid lipstick also
pulled a really red color on me so I
can't really say that I'm surprised so
just going kind of back and forth and
some small circular motions I'm gonna go
in with a more densely packed brush I'm
going to take a luck C 231 a small
tapered blending I'm going to dip in
there I am getting a little bit of kick
up but it's because it's so soft I can
already see that these are super soft
and silky
alright I'm kind of working it on the
outer V taking it onto the lid as well
because we're just going to do a one
shadow look so we want it all over in
fact why don't I dip in oh yeah it feels
super silky
why don't I dip in with my finger here
kind of Pat that onto the lid and then
we can continue to kind of blend a
little bit so gun going back in with
that look see brush yeah and we're just
going to blend this together super
pretty color though you guys looks
gorgeous I feel like if you do have
light colored eyes
it is going to be great I mean I feel
like especially if you do have a deep
complexion as well this is definitely
going to show up on you because it's got
that cool town sort of vibe but I don't
know I feel like when I'm blending it
out here it's turning more reddish on my
particular skin tone I feel like that's
the beauty of makeup is that it looks
different on everyone but this is the
color that it's pulling on me so anyway
let's go ahead and continue to blend
this into the crease I'm really kind of
focusing on the like actual socket here
or the nobody says socket take a socket
to be eye sight I am really focusing on
the actual crease here really building
it in there so you can get a little bit
of depth all right now let's go ahead
and blend that out I'm going to take a
morphe I'm five-eleven
and let me just go ahead and do it back
and forth motions here and see if we can
blend this out nicely do a little bit of
circular motions as well seems to be
blending really nicely and I mean this
is a this is what I would personally
described as a dark color so I don't
know if you guys can see that but it's
doing it's doing a pretty good job all
right and I'm going to take it up a
little bit kind of raised my brow and do
a little more circular motions yeah I
think that looks nice I mean the more I
blend it out I feel like the warmer it's
actually getting it looks quite cool
toned on my cheeks but it's looking very
red I don't know how it's showing up on
camera but it's looking very red on my
eyes right now which like I love that
kind of look I feel like that's so in
right now with like the naked heat
pallet modern Renaissance
I feel like this shade looks very
similar to red ochre from the modern
Renaissance that's what we're going to
compare it to at the end of the video
all right so again just doing more
circular motions here I feel like it's
blending very very easily did not blend
well on my cheeks at all but it's
blending beautifully on the eyes I mean
it technically is an eye shadow single
not so much a blush I mean no matter
what I do with this kind of color it's
just never going to look pretty on my
skin as a blush even when I'm self-tan
because I'm just way too pasty for that
 but that is OK alright let's go
back in with that luck C 231 and let's
build up just a little bit in the outer
via see if we can get a little more
depth right here
see how that looks but so far I like it
I really like it I think it looks pretty
yeah I mean it's a one shadow look but
that was the points that we can really
see what it would look like right now
I'm going to go in with that morphe
brush again and just keep on blending
it's pretty you guys so pretty I mean I
don't know if I'm going to be able to
find an exact dupe for this because it's
got that cool tone thing but it's got a
little bit of warmth to it I mean it
looks completely different on the eyes
and it does the cheeks
so that is really interesting it's
looking a lot more ashy on my cheeks but
so much more warm toned on my eyes and
it's probably because I'm really really
blending on the eyes so that's most
likely why but I feel like it's blending
beautifully I'm not having too many
issues if you're a blending snob
you probably want to spend a little more
time than I will but I don't like to
spend a huge amount of time blending but
I'm trying to make sure given it a fair
chance here so I'm going to spend a
little more time than I usually would
what do you think though it looks super
ready I like that I look I could wear
this you can do it I could wear that for
sure right a little more circular
motions here and let me tap a little
more on to my actual lid so that we can
get it everywhere mm-hmm yeah it looks
nice again not getting any fallout which
is awesome
I feel like this formula in general
doesn't usually give me a lot of fallout
which I really really like
but you mostly just kind of putting it
on my actual lid and then blending all
the colors together but this is a really
pretty what is it monochromatic sort of
look like just one kind of shadow a one
and done and this definitely could be
that sort of shadow for you all right
now let's go ahead and take this little
guy right here this is the lot to you um
see brush I believe and I'm just going
to pick this up on the end here and I
want to smoke this out on the lower lash
line and take it in a little bit my
biggest issue with these kind of colors
is sometimes they kind of make me look a
little sick if it's too red tone and
this is
when looking a lot more red tone on my
eye area I'm not quite sure why but it
is obviously everything looks different
on different skin tones but I'm curious
to see how this would look when I'm not
self tanned as well
and a lot of you have been asking what
self tanner I'm use I'm going to take a
sigma let's see here at east avenue just
to blend underneath and kind of smoke
that out
I do use the Jergens natural glow in the
mousse version for fair to light skin
and I usually use the mousse one I have
quite a few from last summer obviously I
won't repurchase because they test on
animals but I have quite a few of those
all right that blended nicely on the
lower lash line as well again I feel
like I totally have clown cheeks right
now but the high look is I'm liking it
I'm liking it all right and I'm going to
take up my BH Cosmetics fluffy crease
brush and we're just going to blend the
upper part of the eye now since we're
not taking any sort of other eye shadow
we want to make sure we still have a
little bit of lightness but then a
little bit of like diffused color
working its way up so now it's kind of
doing like this dark cool tone thing on
the lid and then working the way up from
like a reddish to almost like an orange
color super pretty you guys I'm liking
it I'm liking this I look a lot ok this
I could do this like I said my one
biggest complaint with these I don't
know if I said it yet but these shatters
so easily these little eye shadow
singles especially if they are in the
foiled a formula I don't know if it just
breaks all the time like I mean
obviously it's on axe by accident but I
don't know I'm just super sloppy and
like I just don't give two shits enough
but I try and pack it really nicely but
yeah I have so much makeup that seems to
break on me alright it's getting a
little patchy here where I tried to kind
of put it on the lid I'm just going to
kind of go over that area but I feel
like it's just because I'm continuously
blending so that's probably why but that
seems to be the only area where I'm
having a hard time at the actual
blending from the crease up really is
looking nice in my opinion looking a
little sloppy on the lid but everywhere
else
I'm liking so sorry I don't love people
like when I do that now what I'm going
to do is kind of
want to tap a little bit onto my lips
cuz why the hell mon-sol just gonna take
that kinda go onto the lip area and you
definitely can mix this with like some
sort of a gloss and it would obviously
stay longer but I just wanted to see
what that look like okay really no point
because I don't have anything sticky to
go with but when I was looking at this I
thought it looked very similar to this
over liquid lipstick I mean I know that
Kat Von D has the liquid lipstick about
this shade right here called hip Noah is
very very kind of similar to this as you
guys can see it's maybe a little deeper
in tone but anyway alright let's go
ahead and put a little eyeliner on it
this is the cosmedix no tug waterproof
gel liner just going to take that right
onto my waterline I'm not going to
tightline just come to the waterline so
we can have a little bit of definition
and having really really red eyelids
lately or just like on my waterline
super super red as well alright now
let's go in with the Maybelline lash
discovery at mascara this is like the
bottom lash kind of mascara I'm just
gonna take that and actually gonna give
this little mirror here so you can see
what I'm doing I always seem to get
really sloppy with my mascara on camera
I think it's because my mirror is so far
away but I'm just taking that and
applying that to what my lashes and then
we're gonna go in with you why I saw the
shock mascara why sell recently
contacted me on octoly they wanted to
send me a bunch of products I was like
stay away demon you didn't know why is
that like really tests on animals like
they're known for doing a not a lot of
animal testing at least that's what I've
seen my conspiracy attentively um but
yeah I was like stay away from me they
wrote to me three times I was like no no
don't technique don't tempt me not
purchasing from you or not like getting
is sent a new free products from you
alright so there is one layer of mascara
let's go ahead and put on the wife's all
the shock now I just have a little baby
size the formula is nice a super super
goopy though and very very wet I feel
like I've tried better mascaras before
but a lot of people like the way that my
lashes
I use this so anyway just putting one
layer of that on top of the Maybelline
and then we will i think call it a day I
feel like my cheeks look absolutely and
saying butt cheeks look insane um but I
look as pretty okay I take this I think
this if you really want to get fancy I
mean you can go ahead and like put some
tape there you can go ahead and blend a
little longer that I did it cuz you guys
know me I'm not the definitely not the
queen of blending over here but I mean
first impressions wise love it on the
eyes I mean I feel like it's making my
blue eyes go through the screen alright
is she here so that is it guys what do
you think the cheeks I don't want to
laugh can obscure my mouth Cara's gonna
touch my freaking eyes um but yeah I
feel like the actual blush looks insane
I look like an insane person but this
eye look I'm liking it a lot I'm really
really liking that so now let's go ahead
and do some swatches shall we will see
if we can find anything comparable the
first thing I want to swatch is from the
elf blush palette this shade right here
is giving me Lolita eyeshadow blush
vibes so here is Lolita there is that so
it might be a little lighter in tone but
hell yeah let's swatch it hell yeah
alright so here is from the Alpha blush
palette this is in dark by the way now
let's go ahead and swatch Lolita see
what that looks like
oh they're completely different they're
completely different so there is the elf
one here's Lolita damnit
let's swatch the other dark shade of
nail Khaled nope god they look like they
would be similar but they're not at all
elf elf Lolita alright next that did not
work out at all
all right let's try another modern
renaissance palette like I said I feel
like the shade red ochre in here it
might be similar here is a red ochre
I'll swatch it please be a match please
please please bitch yes oh oh this might
be the most similar that we're going to
find there is red ochre there is Lolita
that is
that is pretty damn similar red ocher
from the modern medicines Lolita a
little more cool tone here a little more
red tone but so similar that is probably
the closest we're gonna find I'm just
kind of putting that out there right
away because when I saw that in the pan
I was like that's gonna be that's gonna
be the one so I would say so far
modern Renaissance for sure if you
already have this do you need this hell
no no course not
all right next let's try this laura
geller blush now this is more shimmery
but if you like this kind of color maybe
you would like this but I need to swatch
them for us to see if they're similar
this is the laura geller beta blush and
brighten in Rosebery oh hell no what was
I thinking I swear they look similar in
the pan mm-hmm they're so similar okay
good job Olivia good job oh yeah yeah no
no Rose berry hello Lena nope nope nope
nope like I said this is not a dukes
video this is literally nice watching
them out for the first time with you
guys so I tried um let's try this elf
blush right here this one is in called
blushing Rose I got a half shimmer in it
but if you like that kind of color maybe
this will be similar No
what is wrong with me honestly like what
is wrong with me though
nope nope nope all right so there's
Lolita there is elf no listen I tried
okay I tried alright and then finally I
do have an eyeshadow palette here this
is the siete Olivia Palermo palette in
these smoldering um these two shades
right here are kind of calling my name
as far as Lolita is concerned so it
might be a little too that yeah this
could way too ashy but this one right
here kind of reminds me of Ashley but
it's got more shimmer to it let's try it
let's try it okay that's that matte one
no no bitch alright alright let's see
okay kind of similar so there is the
Olivia Palermo smoldering one this one
is the shimmer there is the matte and
then there is Lolita so so far you guys
I would say modern renaissance for sure
that red ochre shade super super super
similar this one definitely pulls more
red tones well
Swach those one more time next to each
other so here is red ocher super
pigmented very very blendable would
highly recommend the modern renaissance
palette I talk about it all the time
here's Lolita I mean gosh they're
similar you guys they're super similar
this one's just a little more red tones
but like are you going to be able to see
that on the eyes probably not probably
not so anyway I think that you know if
you have the modern renaissance you
definitely don't need the Lolita single
I'm going to go ahead and just clean
this up here quickly with a little bit
of a q-tip but yeah so far I'm liking it
is this something that I think you
absolutely need now it's not working for
me as a blush at all it's way too dark
but I love the eye look so I'm enjoying
it when I repurchase another probably
not but I like having it in my
collection I think it's pretty really
nice on a blue eyes and I feel like if
you have any sort of skin tone this is
going to work for you so yeah first
impressions liking it so far I will keep
you guys updated and yeah that is pretty
much it
thanks for joining me for this first
impressions you guys and I will see you
tomorrow for my piles and hell rails bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
