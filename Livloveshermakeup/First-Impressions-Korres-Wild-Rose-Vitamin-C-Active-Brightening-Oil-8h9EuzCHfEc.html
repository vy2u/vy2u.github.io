this video I am giving you guys on my
first impressions on the new Korres or
Korres Wild Rose vitamin C active
brightening oil I'm going to apply this
on camera I obviously do not have any
makeup on right now I did cleanse my
face and then I even cleansed it again
with a micellar water from simple so
absolutely no makeup I didn't put any
sort of toner or spray or mist nothing
so squeaky clean skin and I'm really
really excited to try this out
I recently hauled this I'll link the
video below if you would like to see the
haul but I was really really excited
because it just looked really really
intriguing it basically is a brightening
oil it has the vitamin C so it's gonna
help lighten up hyperpigmentation acne
scarring and I love me some oil so when
it got it I was really surprised if this
is what the outer box looks like it's
just typical you know whatever but when
I opened it up I was like whoa there are
actually little pieces of rose petals in
here so I don't know how that works it's
like a dropper form so I don't know if
the rooms panels are gonna go up on the
skin I'm guessing maybe not I'm not
quite sure but anyway they say to gently
massage a few drops on to cleansed face
and neck and that's what we are gonna do
maybe get a little bit about what it
says on the support comp website you see
you guys can get a better understanding
of this product it says it is a powerful
brightening oil that is infused with
real rose petals and boosted with super
C to increase skin's absorption of
vitamin C by up to a thousand percent
this innovative brightening oil infused
with real wild rose petals pays homage
to Lieutenant Lilith legendary wild rose
oil
ingredient that started at all this
ultra concentrated vitamin C oil is rich
in omega-3 69 fatty acids vitamin A and
C it provides significant antioxidant
action while repairing the look of fine
lines and wrinkles and improving skin
overall skins overall tone and texture
the formula is boosted with super C
which increases skins vitamin C
absorption by 1000% to support natural
collagen synthesis a powerful skin
brightening tone repair and antioxidant
protection against free radical and UV
damage hi Babu comma yeah C am apu is a
plant derived extract that delivers
benefits while improving the skins
luminosity this
get oil easily absorbs into skin
delivering a fresh dewy and feel though
it is free of parabens sulfates and
fatal aids and I'm super super excited
to put some of this on I really really
love oils I do have combination skin so
I try and be careful not to really load
it up in my t-zone but I think oils are
so so wonderful so I am excited by the
way this is a lot to get a lot in here
you get over one fluid ounce which is a
lot of oil so let's just do this gently
massage a few drops on to cleanse face
and neck and you guys know it that
because they don't edit my videos I
can't do like a checkup throughout the
day it's a night time anyway so I will
come back in a week and give you guys my
final thoughts on this oil I think
that's better anyway because then you
get to spend some time with the actual
product so that is what it looks like oh
it doesn't really smell that much like a
rose to be completely honest smells like
that there couldn't possibly be alcohol
in here it smells like um a very very
sweet rose with like a shot of vodka on
the side so it's a really really nice
texture very like it's very easy to
glide across the skin most oil of our
but I like the feel of it it's not super
thick like tarte maracuja oil or even
Josie Marans argan oil this one is just
really really light and I feel like it's
definitely not going to weigh down my
combination skin I felt like I took
quite a few drops there and it is pretty
much sinking into my skin
I really really like the texture of this
is a beautiful oil alright alright so
that was like quite a few drops and I
feel like it already kind of sunk in
which is awesome
it definitely is a very very liquidy
it's not thick whatsoever
and I just feel like it does give
obviously a luminous effect to the skin
any oil will but I really like this
because it literally feels like like oil
water if that makes sense it's not thick
like avocado oil or argan oil or even
maracuja oil like I said those are very
thick oils it's very light kind of lends
me a little bit of jojoba oil that is
like the oil that's supposed to be as
close to like the skin sebum which is
basically like when you get oily sebum
it releases through your pores or
through your scalp um that like I don't
know but oil it's supposed to be like
the one that has like I don't know it's
supposed to be very very similar to like
the actual oil I'm sorry so I don't know
but it feels very very similar to that
um now that I smell it a little more
there definitely is rose in there which
is great because I'm a huge lover of all
things rose I'm pretty sure that's why I
got it because it said rose and also
brightening um snow let me mention the
price because it is quite pricey but you
do get a lot it is fifty four dollars
um but you do get over one fluid ounce
just a lot of oil now I did use a couple
drops I would say but the dropper
actually fills up all the way so I just
say I use probably about four drops that
came out really quickly because it is so
liquidy but I like this like you can
barely tell that I have oil on now you
don't mean like that's really cool um
for a second okay so it smells a little
bit like rose petals but there's nothing
a little chemical a little chemically in
there I bet I'm smelling and I'm not
quite sure what but it does smell like
rose petals which I like it seems like
that is probably going to be as good as
week
get it so I am just going to use this
tonight on my skin I'm not gonna layer
it with anything else I really want to
see if it's over the course of the week
because I told you guys I'll come back
in a week to check up and let you guys
know my final thoughts but or do a
follow-up review but I really want to
see if using this on my skin at night
it's going to help lighten up the
hyperpigmentation that I have from acne
scarring like along my jawline and my
cheeks and we shall see I'm very very
excited so I hope you guys enjoyed this
first impressions like I said I will be
back in exactly a week to give you guys
my final thoughts and my follow-up
review I'm doing a haul my follow-up
first impressions review what I like
about this I just have to say it's like
going around my eye area very nicely
sometimes oils that are infused with
other chemicals can sting around the eye
area but this actually feels really nice
and supple so I am I like high hopes for
this product we shall see and I will see
you guys back here in a week bye thanks
