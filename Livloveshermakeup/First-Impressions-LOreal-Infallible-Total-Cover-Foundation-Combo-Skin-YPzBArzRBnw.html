thank you so much for joining me
happy Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday or
Thursday whenever you guys are gonna be
seeing this video I am filming this
early in the week but I am here to do a
first impressions on a new foundation
for you guys this is the L'Oreal
infallible total cover foundation I was
super super excited to get my hands on
this because you guys know I am a huge
fan of the L'Oreal infallible Pro matte
foundation and also a pretty big fan of
the L'Oreal infallible Pro glow
foundation so when I saw that they were
releasing this new foundation I got very
excited
I personally purchased mine on Amazon
for $10.99 they did send me two tubes by
accident I definitely don't think this
was on purpose because $10.99 for two
tubes is a lot so anyway I did get this
on Amazon they do have 12 different
shades to choose from you are getting
one fluid ounce of product in here which
is the standard amount for a foundation
and that is the amount that you get in
the other two foundations and they do
have 12 different shades to choose from
they shade that I chose is 3:01 classic
ivory and if you guys are curious the
shade that I wear in the infallible Pro
matte is one zero one classic ivory and
in the provo I wear two zero one classic
ivory so I'm classic ivory all around
that is the lightest shade so yeah I'm
just gonna go ahead and apply this today
we're gonna do a first impressions and
then on Sunday during my fails in Holy
Grails I look at you guys my final
thoughts on this product so I have
already gone ahead and cleansed my skin
if you guys didn't know when I do a
first impressions on a foundation I do
like to go ahead and not put any sort of
skincare on just to see how it does hold
up throughout the day and now this week
I will try it with three different
primers I have my Becca backlight
priming filter which is more of a
hydrating or luminous primer I also have
my Stila aqua glow which is more of a
sticky or tacky makeup extender and then
also my true chic lot which is from
Elias L and this is more of a silicone
based primer so I will be trying out
with different setting powders and also
different primers throughout the week
but just for my first impressions I like
to just apply it with nothing so I have
already cleansed my skin like I said I
have not put any skincare on so let's go
ahead and jump right into it so this is
what the actual packaging looks like I
like it it is in a squeezy bottle it
says the finish is supposed to be
natural the wear time is 24 hours the
courage is high and then it says the
texture is air light and when I shake it
up I can hear that it almost sounds like
it's a mousse consistency so let's go
ahead and put some on at the back of our
hand and this is what the little
applicator looks like it just squeezes
right out so yes it is very very moosie
as you guys can see I would say the
consistency reminds me a lot of the
Rimmel stay matte foundation like right
off the bat now to apply this today I
will be applying half of it with my Real
Techniques expert face brush on the
right side of my face and then I will be
applying it with a damp sponge on the
other side this is the Ulta blending
sponge and it is damp like I said so
let's go ahead and just start applying
this the texture is very very whipped so
I'm gonna apply it on the left side of
my face first and yeah it really reminds
me of the Rimmel stay matte like right
off the bat so that was like what I
would consider one pump if this was in a
like pump bottle but it's not it's a
squeezy tube which I do like because I'm
gonna put it around my eye area as well
I do like because you really can control
how much you put out all right let's go
ahead and blend that in with the damp
sponge and we will see what kind of
coverage we get here
I love the coverage on the pro matte
foundation so I'm hoping that this has
just as good of coverage and I'm
guessing that it will so so far that
looks like a pretty good color match now
you may not think so when you're looking
at it looks a little white but I do find
it that these are foundations start to
oxidize throughout the day and by the
way if you guys didn't know I do not
edit my videos here on YouTube so what I
will do is I will leave a comment down
below it will be the first thing that
you see in the comment section and I
will tell you how this wore throughout
the day because you guys are probably
watching this later at night but I am
filming this in the morning so I will
leave my thoughts on it down below
alright so there is the coverage for
about technically one pump or about the
size of a pea on the back of my hand you
guys can see it is starting to oxidize
on the back of my hand already so I
definitely think this is going to darken
up but I like the coverage I think it
looks nice
I actually don't think it's as good as
the infallible Pro matte I feel like I
actually get more coverage from the
infallible Pro matte it
has more of like a liquidy consistency
but this definitely feels lightweight on
the skin I feel like it kind of didn't
do very well as far as going into like
my nose area and maybe a little bit of
creasing around this area but I think
that that looks pretty darn good for one
layer all right so let's go ahead and
apply some on the other side so I'm
going to take about the same amount and
we are gonna go ahead and start dotting
that onto the face and we will see if
the sponge wins or if the brush wins
because you never know I am more of a
sponge girl so I'm guessing that I am
going to prefer the sponge method but
like I said you never know
alright go ahead and on and I'm using it
around my eyes because I'm not gonna go
in with any concealer or anything I'm
specifically only going to wear this
foundation today all right now taking my
Real Techniques expert face brush I'm
gonna go ahead and start blending that
in and kind of downward stroking
emotions hmm interesting I actually
think that looks maybe a tad better on
the side that I used it the brush I want
to go in with another layer of this on
each side because I'm not seeing this
like fullfil full coverage thing going
on here I will say I'm noticing a little
bit of dryness already up here now my
combo skin does get a little more dry
this time of year but that's just
something to go ahead and point out and
this side is starting to get a little
darker as you guys can see it's starting
to dry down so I really can't see a huge
difference between the sponge side and
the brush side I actually think that the
brush side might look a little better so
what I'm gonna do is go ahead and apply
another layer and then we will finish
that off so let's do another layer over
here kind of dotting it on areas that I
really need a little extra coverage
which for me are around on my eyes and
then also right here where I do tend to
have a little bit of acne scarring and
things like that huh very interesting I
mean it definitely feels very
lightweight on the skin but I'm not
seeing this fullfil full coverage thing
I swear I feel like my infallible Pro
matte has a little more coverage than
this so I'm going to go ahead and blend
that in again with the brush I actually
really like the way that it is applying
with the brush which is interesting
because like I said usually I do prefer
a sponge over the brush now okay now
going in with that second layer yes the
coverage is definitely buildable however
you can really see that it is starting
to get a little dry up here near my
forehead area so that is something to be
aware of but I do think that it is quite
buildable so that is pretty darn full
coverage over here now with two layers
let's go ahead and do the same on the
other side and we will apply with the
sponge this may be one of those
foundations where you blend it in with a
brush and then you go over with a damp
sponge just to make sure everything is
all evened out so just wanted to put
that out there but I do feel like it's
applying really nicely on both sides
with either tool so that is good to know
I think I mean a little more coverage
with the sponge normally I get maybe a
little more coverage with a brush but I
do feel like I'm getting a little more
coverage with the sponge side so if you
want more coverage I would go with a
damp sponge if you want a nice I can't
even tell I don't know you guys I feel
like the finish over here looks nicer
but I'm getting more coverage on the
sponge side I don't know how it's
picking up on camera you'll have to let
me know down below what you think but I
actually think it looks pretty darn good
on each side more coverage on the left
for sure with the sponge a little less
with the brush side but I actually like
the way that this looks I think it is
quite pretty so I'm just gonna go ahead
and finish off my whole face with the
sponge really quickly just to make sure
we have everything blended and I don't
think I'm gonna have to set in my whole
entire face I probably will just set in
my t-zone because I am a combo to oily
skin I still do have to go ahead and set
because it will start moving around
throughout the day but I think it looks
pretty good it feels super good on the
skin very very air light I just don't
know about that full coverage thing
um this is definitely not like the most
full coverage foundation I've ever worn
it's not like it's the full coverage
capacity of say something like the Kat
Von D or even the Rimmel stay matte
which I feel like it's very similar to
inconsistency I will say it is starting
to emphasize dryness around my forehead
area and a little bit around my nose
like in the little crevices but it looks
really good everywhere else sorry let me
just wipe down my lips but yeah so what
do you guys think I think it looks
pretty darn good
I will actually go ahead and set my
whole face in because that is what I
normally do and I want to give this a
fair shot so I'm gonna take my essence
all about Matt fixing compact powders
which is one of my all-time favorite
powders I'm gonna take my ELF kabuki
brush I'm just going to go in there and
we're just gonna start setting the face
starting in my eye area mostly
concentrating in my t-zone and then we
can see how it looks with the powder if
it's going to emphasize dry areas even
more or if it'll just give it a really
nice kind of airbrushed finished look
but so far I'm impressed with how
lightweight it feels I will say the
consistency for the amount of coverage
I'm getting is really really awesome but
I don't you guys may disagree but me
just looking in the camera I would not
say that this is like full full coverage
I definitely thought this is going to be
more coverage than the pro matte but I
feel like it's about the same coverage
as the pro matte alright so that is what
it looks like got powder all over me
that is what it looks like now after we
have set it in completely it is
definitely starting to kick up around my
nose area on the little cracks of my
nose things like that and a little bit
on my forehead but it looks good around
my eye area I feel like it did cover
things nicely covered redness
discoloration and it did it cover up a
little bit of my dark circles so that is
what the foundation looks like on my
face and yeah overall first impressions
wise I liked it I don't think it's as
full coverage as a claim that's going to
be but it does feel very very light on
the skin I think you would like this if
you do have combo to oily skin if you're
a very dry skin or very much her skin I
feel like this is gonna start settling
into areas that you don't want on your
face so
I would just you know be aware of that
but maybe you could mix it together with
a little bit of oil and get it to work
for you so anyway that is it guys I will
be back on a Sunday during my fails and
holy grails to give you guys on my final
thoughts I think first impressions wise
it looks pretty darn good on the skin I
will probably have to play around with
different primers this week to see how
this will go I'm guessing that it's not
going to look that great with the Stila
but it is gonna look good with the
silicon based primer and the hydrating
primer for sure so yeah that is it guys
thank you so much for joining me for
this first impressions and I will see
you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
