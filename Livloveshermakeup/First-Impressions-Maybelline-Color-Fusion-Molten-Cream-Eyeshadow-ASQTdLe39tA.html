going to be doing a first impressions
review on at these maybelline color
molten eyeshadows these are from my
studio and I have them in the shades and
list mode which is like a nice deep
chocolatey brown with some shimmer and a
nice Goldy shade and I also have rose
haze which is a pink color and a deep
kind of mauve purpley color they both
look really really pretty I have only
dipped my fingers in there I haven't
like swatch them properly or anything
like that let's go ahead and do
swatching actually so there's that
bronzy shade deep chocolatey one a
swatch pretty well not that that really
means anything know they could swatch
really well and look like crap on the
skin that pink one doesn't really show
up okay well I think I'm going to go
ahead and use the bronze e1v endless
mocha so you have that gold shade and
then the darker color seems to kind of
stain a little bit good anyway these are
basically just supposed to be a cream
shadow that like dissolve like on your
skin into like a molten like texture I
guess they remind me of the Dream bouncy
blushes in texture they're kind of like
you can stick your finger in there you
know you can get like an indentation so
I do like the way that you feel and I
think that cream shadows are really in
right now with color pop and just
everybody's coming out with cream
shadows right now so I'm excited that
someone at the drugstore did anyway
let's just get started and yeah first
thing I'm going to do is get some
brushes out I'm gonna take this Ecotools
just like flat brush and I'm just gonna
Pat color onto my lid I'm gonna take
that Goldy shade and just Pat that on
there
you seem to be pretty well pigmented and
it's nice because you don't get fallout
because they are cream um next I'm gonna
take a dance because it is a cream I
don't want my crease brush to like push
in on it so so I'm gonna go ahead and
take this little beauty stuff flat stiff
brush and I'm gonna work into the crease
with this with the darker chocolatey
brown shade mm-hmm he's not having to
worry about fallout because I was using
a dark powder right now powder it would
be like John's yeah right I'm gonna go
ahead and take my Sigma e-40 and blend
that out huh these are not super super
easy to blend tell you that right now
I'm gonna go in and take some of that
pinky one and maybe a hit under my brow
so lighten up the area it's not very
pigmented all right I'm just gonna keep
blending problem with cream shadow is
sometimes when you place it on the area
that it's gonna be it just sticks there
which in some ways is good but when
you're working into the crease it's not
all right all righty
you go ahead and take let's see here
this elf small precision brush looks
like that and I'm going to go in to
actually I'll go in to the kind of
purply color I'm going to take that
under my lower lash line used to make
good you know lower lash line shadows
because they're so creamy they're almost
like an eyeliner
annalee kitties crying what are you
doing
mommy's being on eye shadow I'm gonna
take that and blend a little under again
with the same 40 brush don't think that
these all right so I don't know what
else I can really do here I think I'll
take that purple and I'm just gonna Pat
it into the outer V tap it on there for
a little more depth
and again just gonna blend to the crease
of the e-40 doing small circles since
these are looking a little muddy right
there I'm just gonna take a different to
be 41 take this one and I'm gonna take
that pink shade again and kind of work
that into you guys are wondering why my
skin doesn't look so full cover just
because I just did a review and demo on
the bare minerals um
what assess complexion rescue it's
pretty light coverage so I will link
that video below if you guys are
interested this needs a little bit so
okay it looks pretty good the shadows
the pretty pretty play blended pretty
blended they seem to get a little
mundane muddy and kind of run into each
other and they don't look as like sharp
as they do in the container but overall
they're nice and they don't have fall
out because you know creatures are so
good for that so I'm just now going to
take some eyeliner mascara and we'll see
what did the finish look is going to be
like can you take my Tarte lights camera
lashes and lately it's so precise
I'm gonna put too much mascara because I
want it to mean we focus on the
eyeshadow but it just gives the eye a
little wider appearance really kind of
muddy up close just kind of muddled
together I'm sure like that it's like
one color all over even though I used
all four so anyway okay we have mascara
on now I think that's gonna be it I
guess we could put some eyeliner on I'm
gonna use this what is this Makeup
Forever aqua eyes and black family
waterline
okay so that is our look it's nice I
will admit to not having to clean up and
you kind of fall out that might have
happened however I'm still gonna grab my
q-tips over here and hit any areas that
I got extra mascara on them like it's
too bad so yeah this is what I got um
for this look I've used all four shades
and I think they look a little muddled
together they're not really standing out
as separate colors and in the pan they
really do look like they're separate
colors so they're all kind of just
blended into each other and I just that
can be good if that's the look that
you're going for but I was really hoping
that these would be like you know oh
that's the color that's there and oh and
her lower lash line she's a different
one but so far they just kind of look
really muddled together anyway um I do
like the texture I like that there's no
fallout but the pigmentation is actually
good pigmentation is good but you know
it's just they look so money and I don't
know it's like worse than why I blend it
so I don't know um I will give you guys
an update and a follow-up on this in
about a week I will use these this week
and play with them a little more and see
what I like to do with them and that's
it I hope you guys enjoyed at this first
impressions review ups did I get there
aminos hope you guys enjoyed this video
and I'll see you my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
