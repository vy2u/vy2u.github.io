happy Monday it's Monday I shouldn't be
saying that anyway welcome back to my
channel I hope you are all having a
fantastic day
I am fresh-faced in the morning I just
woke up and I'm not wearing PJs it was
actually a normal tot but I have not put
in any of my accessories for the day yet
but I am here to do another first
impressions for you guys today
on a product that I recently hauled from
Sephora I'll link the Sephora haul video
in the description bar if you guys want
to watch it anyway I recently hauled
this NARS Velvet Matte skin tint with
broad-spectrum SPF 30 I did put a little
bit of it on the back of my hand when I
did the video but for the most part I
have not even like put this on my face I
literally have just watched it on the
back of my hand
and yeah I'm here to do a first
impressions for you guys I was really
excited about this product
it's normally something that I would not
have gone and like looked for I'm
honestly not a huge fan of NARS products
and it's not because I just don't like
their products it's because I honestly
just don't own a lot of their products
so I never like when something new
releases from NARS I'm not like the
first person to like jump on it just
because they don't own a lot of products
from them and yeah anyway my friend Amy
recently did a really good review on
this product and he demo and I was like
that looks beautiful on her skin I
really should pick it up
it was $44 and you do get - let me see
here 1.7 ounces of products or 50 ml in
here which is a little over the standard
amount for a foundation and this is
basically just a Velvet Matte skin tint
it says it has broad-spectrum SPF 30
it's supposed to protect the skin and
perfect it for a soft matte finish it's
oil-free is supposed to wear comfortably
on the skin while maintaining the skins
natural moisture barrier it's supposed
to help with control shine throughout
the day it's supposed to help a little
bit blur the imperfection all block even
out the skin tone smooth the appearance
of pores and fine lines it has a soft
matte soft touch and simply glide on and
go so that's a lot of claims for a
product it seems like it supposed to be
lightweight like basically a matte
formula and it's supposed to cover and
blur imperfections and things like that
I have gone ahead and already cleansed
my face
because I'm doing a first impressions
won't be putting on any sort of primer
anything like that cuz I want to see how
well this product can go on the skin
alone but I did go ahead and cleanse my
face with one of the Olay Hendrickson
grease relief cleansing cloths
I just ran one of these over my face and
yeah I am just bare face now and I have
no excess residue on there and we're
just gonna go ahead and put this baby on
so let me put my headband in so I don't
get any product in my hair and when I
watched Amy's video she pretty much said
that this has the coverage of like a
foundation and when I actually splashed
it on the back of my hand in the haul
video it really did seem like it had a
nice formulation so I'm gonna go ahead
and shake it up a little bit cuz I
remember it being sort of liquidy and
the shade that I have by the way is like
2-0 heren Nueve that is what it looks
like I believe this is the lightest
shade and I'm just gonna go ahead and
put some of this on the back of my hands
now the because of the consistency is so
liquidy now doesn't look as liquidy when
i swatched it in the video it looked a
little more liquidy I'm gonna go ahead
and apply it with my damp Real
Techniques sponge so it has a little bit
of a sunscreen scent to it alright so
I'm gonna put some on there and just go
ahead and start applying this to my face
so I immediately can see that it
definitely does have it the coverage of
like a light to medium coverage
foundation it's already covering things
quite nicely and this is a really nice
skin tone match I did think when I had
smushed it on the back of my hand I kind
of thought that it had a bit of like a
yellow undertone but this is actually
matching my skin a quite well and I have
a cool undertone so I feel a little more
pink and red tones and this looks nice
so maybe I was wrong about the undertone
but anyway I'm just dabbing this all
over and I like the way that is sitting
on the skin already now I've already
used that little pump and I don't feel
like that's spread all over like enough
so I'm gonna go back in with another
little squeeze of this product and I
also want to see if I can build it up in
certain areas on my face so there's
another little squeeze okay there we go
a little more alright so it's building
up nice
around my cheek area where I do have
some acne scarring let's see how it does
around the eyes see if it can cover my
dark circles I actually think that did
quite a good job like compared to this
eye that absolute is pretty darn good
I'm liking this it doesn't look
completely matte to me it has a little
bit of luminosity I don't want to say
luminosity because I'm already feeling
like it is drying down to a pretty much
matte finish but I think if you have dry
skin you should probably stay away from
this product but I would say it has more
of like a Debbie matte not completely
like matte finish more of a demi matte
finish but that really covered my dark
circles point nicely so I'm going to go
back in on the other side and I feel
like the product is actually building up
quite nicely on the skin I like it
and I like the way it's covering my eye
area it's starting to smell a little bit
like lemon now so it's melt a little
chemicaly chemicaly at the beginning
when I first started applying it but now
it smells a little bit like lemon
actually kind of smell similar to the it
cosmetics CC cream so hopefully there's
no artificial fragrances in here I know
in the cosmetics CC cream it has quite a
strong fragrance but none of them are
artificial like fragrances they're all
natural but it feels a little bit like
lemon or lemongrass or something like
that
I like this this is nice coverage amy
was right this is definitely I mean it's
not like it's like full coverage or even
like medium coverage but I would say
it's light too buildable medium coverage
wait did I just say it's not meeting
coverage I mean it can be those up to
medium coverage so yeah it looks really
nice I actually really like the way this
looks on my skin it really covered up my
dark circles quite well I feel like it
looks good like two layers of this
really does look like a foundation and
I'm really liking the color match I feel
like it is blending in with my skin a
quite and nicely so yeah this is pretty
darn good I like this liking this guy so
here it is with two layers of the
products let me go ahead and wipe my
lips do you guys get foundation all over
your lips too when you apply your makeup
I know some people like avoid their lip
area I just go all over I like to
take that base um yeah this looks really
really nice I'm gonna let it just sit
here for a second to see if it can kind
of dry down to more of a matte finish
since it does claim to be a like matte
skin tint but I will not consider this
like a BB cream or even a CC cream
I feel like this gives really really
nice coverage like a foundation it's
kind of similar in coverage to the it
cosmetics CC cream it's not as luminous
as the CC cream I feel like if you have
dry skin or aging skin you would
definitely preferred the cosmetics CC
cream that one has a little more
luminosity luminosity to it but this one
is beautiful I think if you have oily
skin or composted you're gonna like this
because it's kind of drying down to that
like Demi matte appearance so I'm going
to go ahead and set this in with powder
now I have my essence all about matte 16
compact powder and I'm going to use my
it cosmetics the Buki buffing brush I'm
just going to swirl into the product and
then stipple this on and see what it
looks like when we set it in I feel like
the finish of it it's not gonna change
that much since it is already like a
demi matte look on the skin feels very
lightweight I don't feel like I'm really
wearing anything on my face and I think
it is nice that it has SPF 30 in it that
will be great for the summertime I'm
liking this I'm liking the way this
looks I don't feel like I need to put
tons and tons of powder on I'm just kind
of touching up in the areas like around
my t-zone where it tends to get a little
more oily but I'm like this is pretty I
think this looks really really nice it
doesn't look like it looks kind of like
skin
I guess the kind of Demi matte
appearance is making it look a little
more like makeup but it doesn't look
like I'm wearing like a full coverage
foundation or anything like that like
yesterday I did a first impressions on
the Rimmel stay matte foundation which
was like literally if I went like this
like you could tell I was wearing makeup
but this is a nice I'm liking this I'm
hoping that it kind of stays like really
really mad throughout the day so that I
don't have to be touching up but the
finish is really beautiful I love the
color match and I think this looks
really really good actually I'm liking
this a lot so anyway I will be back in a
week
you guys my final thoughts on this
products let you know what my favorite
way of applying it is I will try it with
a brush and also with my fingers this
week and yeah I will be back like I said
in a week I hope you guys enjoyed this
