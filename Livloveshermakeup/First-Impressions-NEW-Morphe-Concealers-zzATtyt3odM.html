this video I am sharing a first
impressions with you guys on the new
morphe concealers I picked up two of
them in these shades khaki and also bare
skin and I thought this would be a good
time to go ahead and do a first
impressions on this product although on
the website they kind of say that this
is for like correcting and also
highlighting and contouring your face
I'm actually dealing with some pretty
bad like active breakouts right now in
my t-zone from a product that I was
using last week it's the co de lis creme
sorbet cream it really made me break out
in my t-zone just those really tiny
little whiteheads that are super gross
so I thought it would be a good time to
go ahead and just do a first impressions
on this product instead of reviewing it
because I want to see how well these can
first of all correct underneath my eyes
that was the sole purpose why I picked
them up I wanted to see how they would
you know fend for themselves underneath
my eyes and on my eyelids but also I
want to see if they can cover these
spots on my face so anyway that's what
we're doing in today's video I'm not the
biggest fan of morphe in general I don't
think they're amazing but I also don't
think they're complete I think
they're just okay so I just wanted to
say that really quickly because I'm not
a super fan and I also don't hate them I
do buy some of their products but for
the most part I don't think they're the
most amazing brands but these concealers
are only $4.99 a piece which is really
really really cheap I mean like the two
of these together were like under $10
and it's one of those things where it's
like even at the drugstore nowadays you
can almost not even find a concealer
that's $4.99 so I thought I would just
try them out give you guys my first
impressions I have quite a bit to cover
right now so that's why I decided to do
a first impressions instead of river of
a real beaut I cannot fake it's too
early in the morning alright
so the shades I got our bare skin and
khaki bare skin I think on the website
was the lightest shade and it appears to
have a little more of like a neutral
undertone to it and then the other shade
khaki I think on the website it seems
like I had more of a pinky undertone so
I thought that would be nice for like
color correcting the face and there is
khaki right there so anyway let's go
ahead and get right into this I am going
to pull my hair back quickly
like I said morphe does kind of market
these as like a correcting products but
I mean if it's
Seeler I want to see how it can perform
on areas that I need to conceal as well
so the first thing I'm going to do is go
in with bare skin and I'm going to take
this and cover spots that I want to
cover so this is what it looks like by
the way let's see here there's 12 grams
or 0.42 ounces of product in here it's
just an acrylic container with a little
doe foot applicator and it appears that
the product looks like it's gonna be
somewhat on the dry side so let's go
ahead and just start kind of placing
this on the areas that I want to cover
like I said I'm having some active
little tiny breakouts right now and I
want to see Oh smells like a MAC
lipstick anyway I want to see how this
can cover those little spots and then of
course I will go underneath my eyes with
the shade khaki because that one has a
little more of a pink undertone and I
wanted to see how that would do this is
the lightest shade and I can already
tell it's got more of a peachy undertone
but that's okay I'm going to blend that
in with my Real Techniques damp sponge
so it definitely has a dry consistency
just putting it on my face I can already
see that it's starting to kind of ball
up or patch up like on areas where I'm a
little more dry idea of combo skin so I
am oily in my t-zone but dry on the
outer perimeters of my face and I can
see it's starting to patch up and follow
up a little bit around the outer
perimeters it does seem to cover
somewhat well but again it is starting
to kind of patch up right there which is
kind of gross so that's okay listen
funded in um I don't feel like that did
a very good job of covering up the
pimples and I feel like if I do apply
more of it it's just going to start
taking up so it's okay um as far as
covering up like breakouts and things
like that I would say it is definitely
lights like coverage so let's go ahead
and apply you know what I'm gonna do I'm
gonna apply bare skin again underneath
my eyes and on my eyelids then we're
gonna go in with my foundation and then
I'm gonna take the other shade and put
that on top of my foundation
to see what that looks like so I'm just
taking bare skin this is a very very dry
formula Wow
I'm taking that underneath my eyes and
now I'm starting to think oh my god why
do I want this dry ass product
underneath my eyes but anyway that is
still bare skin and we're just gonna
slip the sponge and I'm just going to go
ahead and blend this and it seems like
the shade actually when I blend it in it
actually looks quite good on my
particular skin tone I am quite fair I'm
not super super super pale but I'm
pretty but anyway it seems like that did
kind of cover some of the discolorations
I had her on my eyes it's actually
sitting a lot better around to my eye
area than it is like on the outer
perimeters of my face and around my nose
so I definitely think it's good that I
picked these up for the eye area because
I think it does sit relatively well so
let's go ahead and put on my foundation
I'm going to be using the covergirl plus
Olay it's actually a CC cream the shade
is 105 ivory I'm just gonna take one
pump of that and dip into my sponge
again and start applying this to my face
isn't that cheap you guys for a
concealer $4.99 hey and I thought that
was like a really really good deal I
don't know I don't know when the last
time it was that I found a concealer for
$4.99 seriously I feel like the
drugstore prices are starting to go
crazy like everywhere everything is so
expensive now it's like alright so I now
have put on my CC cream and I'm just
doing one little pump of it because I
didn't really enjoy natural makeup this
week and last week and like for the
whole month in general so I'm not going
to be like putting too much of this
product on and I will be using a powder
it's the elf tone correcting powder in
the shade Kohl and that will just you
know set in this particular or CC cream
and the concealers without being like
super super like full coverage just
basically just gives like a little bit
of a color correcting tint alright so I
mean there's still definitely redness on
my nose as you guys can
see so CC cream didn't really take care
of that and the concealers didn't really
take care of that but now I want to go
in with the key here one because I want
to color correct so we're gonna take the
shade khaki I'm gonna put this
underneath my eyes I'm gonna go in the V
and then I'm also going to go ahead do
you see how that picks up the products
very uneven on the little applicator
alright so I'm going to take this all
the way down and then on my eyelid as
well right away I'm just seeing that
this is such a sort of texture
seriously if you have like dry skin
you're really gonna want to go ahead and
moisturize well before putting these on
because it's like thick and juicy
although it doesn't get that much
coverage so anyway this is the shade
khaki let's go ahead and blend it and
see what it looks like
well that blended really quickly so
although they are a little moosie and
slightly dry I feel like they blend
really really well I think I like that
shade for underneath the eyes quite a
bit I might flip it around like when I
start using it this week I will of
course be back with like a follow-up
review exactly a week from today but I
think that I would probably switch them
around so I would do khaki underneath my
eyes in the V and then put on my CC
cream or my foundation and then I would
go in with bare skin and then put that
on top of the CC cream or foundation but
I really I think that that kind of color
corrected my face quite nicely
again I don't feel like it really did
anything for my blemishes or anything
like that a little active scarring or
anything but I feel like for the eye
area which is why I actually pick the
product up in the first place in the
first place I feel like it's doing a
good job so there it is on my face now
we're gonna go ahead oh that just messed
up my makeup now we're gonna go ahead
and set this in with powder but yeah I
actually like that khaki shade it is the
darker shade of the two it's a little
more pink toned as you guys can see here
is fair skinned and here is khaki
I actually think I like khaki more
because I like having brightness
underneath my eyes and I feel like that
did color correct quite well it's not
sinking in anywhere I don't know what
that is
it's not sinking into like my fine lines
underneath my eyes which is nice I kind
of thought it would when I first applied
it because it is so mu C but it looks
pretty darn good so let's go ahead and
set that in like I said I'll be using my
alpha tone correcting powder in the
shade cool and I'm going in with my
tarts ear buffer or foundation brush I'm
just going to be stippling this on and
when I'm putting the powder on I'm
trying to keep an eye on if it starts to
start if it starts to start if it starts
to get a little cakey looking it doesn't
so far so that's good so yeah I mean
they kind of market these as like
highlighting and contouring or also just
like color correcting your face I don't
really think it's great for like
camouflaging blemishes or anything like
that you'd be better off with like a
green color corrector for redness or
even just like a better concealer like
that Becca ultimate coverage creme or
whatever it's called I've got one in
like pretty lean you know something
that's a little more thick and a little
more emollient I actually like the way
that this is sitting under the eyes and
I'm kind of surprised because I was a
really dry formula like I was not
expecting for it to be that dry I
actually thought I was gonna be quite
creamy I don't know why but it did so
yeah there is everything all set in I
think I like it me Pinker shade more a
second a lighter shade which is happy by
overall hmm I think it looks pretty darn
good I feel like my face is camouflaged
I only got about four and a half hours
of sleep last night so I feel like my
under eye area isn't too blue and it did
help a little bit in my t-zone but I'm
having quite a bit of breakouts there so
I wouldn't be using these concealers I
can already tell right away I won't be
using these to cover blemishes and
things like that or like acne scarring
but I think they're great for the under
eye area or they look pretty good so far
so I will be back in exactly a week to
give you guys my final
let you know how they wear throughout
the day I did apply all of this without
any primer on my face and of course I
will mess around with different primers
and things like that and yeah
we shall see thank you so much for
joining me for this first impressions on
the new Moorthy concealers and I'll see
you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
