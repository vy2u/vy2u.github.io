happy Wednesday in today's video we have
a first impressions review please
subscribe my hair I know I've been
throwing it up and really messy bun
pretty much all week but I'm taking my
haircut on Friday I can't wait to chop
this off it's just getting really
annoying so yeah it's really earlier the
more you just haven't pulled off of my
face but anyway we are here to do a
first impressions on a new palette that
I recently found on the ulta.com website
this is the Revlon eyes cheeks and lips
palette I believe this was around $18
yes I will link the exact price down
below in the description bar they have
three different shades that you can pick
from one was kind of like a berry color
they had a smoky color and then I got
the shade romantic nudes which is number
a hundred and like I said this was super
super expensive so I really hope this
works well if it doesn't I do have a
friend that really wants to get her
hands on this so I'll probably just pass
it on to her but yeah we're gonna do a
first impressions today on this product
we have six eyeshadows here for lip
products and then a blush and I just
want to say really quickly this came in
the mail kind of like crushed like
slightly crushed as you guys can
probably tell some of the powder
products got into the cream lip products
and one of my friends Meg had caught it
when I posted the picture of this on
Instagram excuse me I have a runny nose
this morning um but she had commented
she was like I hate when they don't have
like a little flap to basically like
separate the cream products from the
powder products and I agree with that
she was saying you know I don't like
palettes like that and I feel like if
you're going to have cream products and
also Carter products mix together you
should have like a little flap so that
they don't get all gross because
literally the blush is already breaking
into the cream lip products and I'm like
really but anyway we are going to put
this on our face or on my face and I
have already put on my covergirl posole
CC cream in the shade 105 ivory I put
two pumps of that all over my face and
then I set my face in but the essence
all about matte 16 compacts compact
powder compacts powder and yeah we're
just going to go ahead and get right
into it
I put those products on today because I
was
in a hurry this morning I actually am in
a hurry this morning so anyway I like to
just throw on a CC cream when I'm in a
hurry in the morning and yeah that's all
I have on my face right now is those two
products so let's go ahead and get right
into this I guess we'll start with the
eyes so um well first of all let me show
you guys there's little brushes in here
that I just don't trust and I don't want
to use we have like a little dual-ended
sponge tip applicator which aren't so
bad but I mean come on look at this
little tiny mini lip brush like I can't
imagine that beam that's very helpful
and then the other item we have here is
like the tiniest little blush brush
which also I can't imagine this being
very helpful whatsoever so let's go
ahead and just get right into it I guess
the first thing I'm gonna do is take my
fluffy Beach Cosmetics crease brush and
I'm gonna go into this shade right here
and they do not have shade names so
anyway it's just going to be this kind
of bronzing shade right here and there's
only one Mac in this eyeshadow palette
so anyway I'm going to take this and
just work it into my crease not a whole
lot of color going on there but that's
okay we're kind of using it as a
transition although it's not matte
alright just working that into the
crease and the reason I didn't get all
three of them was just because I'm a
little iffy of eyeshadow palettes from
the drugstore
I think the lot palettes from L'Oreal
are actually really fantastic they're
very very beautiful just gonna build
that up a little more in my crease I
think they're really really beautiful
but in general I tried a few drugstore
eyeshadow palettes that I wasn't like a
huge fan of so that is why I didn't want
to purchase all three and from what I
can see this is not very pigmented at
all so I don't know if I'm gonna like
this alright moving on I'm going to take
my morphe m5 13 brush and I am going to
go in - hmm I guess I'm gonna go into
this topi shade right here it's a very
powdery and I'm just going to work this
into my crease see if we can build some
color there just kind of build and of
that
come on even the smallest amount of
color I'll take I mean it's nice
sometimes when palettes aren't
completely super super opaque and crazy
because then you do have you know you do
have some room to kind of build shades
up and it's easier not to make mistakes
but I'm also one of those people I don't
like to spend tons of time on my eye
look in the morning I think I've talked
about that quite a bit
I'm not one to sit there and blend for
20 minutes I'm not into that kind of
thing so yeah all right so then I'm
going to go back into the BH Cosmetics
brush and I'm just going to blend that
out back and forth I don't feel like it
really did anything so we're gonna go
back in to a different brush let's go
ahead and take a sigma e35 blending
brush I'm gonna go into this color down
here it's kind of like a bobby sort of
color let's work that into the crease
and see if that will do anything oh I
don't like that it immediately went on
patchy I can see there's like little
lines hmm I mean it's definitely more
pigmented than the middle shades but it
immediately started to get stuck right
in my crease oh wait you're a dog
barking my neighbors have their dogs out
on their boards Oh yuck oh it's getting
patchy like immediately and you know
what that means that means you have to
blend out more which sucks so let's go
back to the BH Cosmetics fluffy crease
I'm gonna blend in circular motions this
time see if we can get that a little
less patchy looking yuck I do not like
that I hate when shadows do that all
right I mean it's not terrible but it's
pretty obvious like color got stuff down
here oh I don't like it I don't like it
all right just keep going blending
blending alright don't like it now I'm
going to go into my Sonia Kashuk number
116 brush I'm going to take this matte
definer shade down here tap off the
excess I'm
to put this on to my outer-v just kind
of stippling it on Oh
oh my god it's like traveling to places
where I don't put it oh I don't like
these shadows at all nope I had really
high hopes for this palette because I
was thinking wow if this works like
that's a nice to have all those products
do you see the eyeshadows going into the
cream products I don't like that either
all right back to the fluffy crease
brush let's blend that in circular
motions again
yikes not impressed guys not impressed
they are blending another not blending
that well I shouldn't say that do you
see how it I put it right here and it
went down here I don't like that at all
alright let's just keep blending in
circular motions alright going in with
my morphe m4 3-1 brush I'm going to go
in to that plummy shade at the bottom
we're gonna put this on the lower lash
line hopefully this will build up okay
goodness you guys tell I'm not impressed
I guess sometimes when you do first
impression you probably shouldn't do it
like when you're on your way to work
because you never know if it's gonna
turn out okay Wow like it went on patchy
here to see this and then over here it's
like it doesn't build evenly I don't
like these shadows at all I can say that
right off the bat I don't like them at
all I'm not getting any fallout which I
guess is okay but I mean I wouldn't
expect any with something that's like so
light and not really that pigmented I
don't feel like this is going on evenly
at all do you see that what is that
there's like a big line of like
weirdness right
and then it's like a clean e-40 brush
just want to run that under there wow
that really looks crappy
alright so back there the beach
cosmetics brush these are exactly the
kind of shadows that I don't like the
ones that go on patchy it's a hard like
a really hard to blend what is that what
happened over here it looks so weird
alright not a lot of Hope here I'm going
to go in to the lightest shade up here
and take that on my finger the top
that's not my lid oh god there's chunks
of glitter in there that is not cute oh
my goodness
I am NOT impressed so far guys I will of
course be back in about a week to give
you guys an update but this is not this
is not my kind of palette I'm just gonna
say that right away I don't even know
what happened over here alright alright
alright alright let's go ahead and curl
those lashes put on some mascara see if
we can kind of fix this oh my god I'm
just so surprised it's so hottie and I
mean I don't love Revlon eyeshadows I
think like their standout like products
are normally oh by the way I'm going in
with my Sephora outrageous curl mascara
I think their standout products are
definitely their face products like
their foundations and their powders are
great but I mean I've never loved their
eyeshadows but I was just hoping because
you know L'Oreal has recently released a
bunch of like pallets that have been
really really good I heard the lot
palette noir is amazing too one of my
friends told me that and I just feel
like these eyeshadows are really just
pooey
it looks okay I guess when I put the
mascara on cuz it's like camouflaging
all of the patchiness but goodness I
mean I don't like to blend that long and
I probably could have sat there and
blended for another ten minutes and it
probably would not have changed they're
just they went on so unevenly so that's
as a bummer guys that is a big bummer
all right so I put on about one layer of
that it looks okay is better haha it was
really bad on the lower lash line that
was surprising alright let's cross our
fingers let's go in with that blush oh
my god I'm really just liking this color
right now guys alright let's go in with
the blush again it doesn't have a name
it's kind of like this peachy sorts of
nude color it's such a small little slot
so I'm gonna be taking my Lexie 504 a
large angled I'm just gonna pitch it and
see if I can pick up some product there
put that on the cheeks Wow oh well I'm
going on there either or and I'm not
gonna tap it off and just gonna put this
 right on there it's a very pretty
color it's not going on its couldn't
have a little patchy I shouldn't say
that
I think these are just very powdery so
wherever you put your brush down
immediately is where it's going to kind
of build up that's what it seems like
it's doing it's a very light natural
sort of color didn't see anything like
I'm sorry if you have like a medium or
deep skin tones like do not get this
particular shade because I'm pretty
freaking light and this blush is barely
showing up on me it's actually getting
patchy right here that is so not cute oh
goodness gracious Revlon seriously keep
I'm going to work like this
alright I think that's about as much as
I can build up look let's go ahead and
take my little it cosmetics boogie
powder ball just hit on the edges where
I put that on to make sure it's not too
patchy looking oh my gosh you guys I am
NOT impressed I am NOT impressed right
now all right
ah let's go in with the lip products so
just gonna go into the darkest shade
because I feel like the lighter ones
aren't going to be that significant I'm
not gonna take that stupid little flimsy
brush I'm just gonna take this dark
color down here with my finger okay that
doesn't look too bad I'm just going to
put that right onto my lip
probably the best product in this
palette yes literally I mean that's
building nicely it feels pretty glossy
it doesn't feel sticky I actually really
like that color so that's all we're
gonna do I am really not impressed my
first impressions are that these are
very dry they're very patchy they're
very flaky
I think the lip products are nice but
again there's so much product going into
the lip products I of course will try it
out for a week I'll be back in a week to
give you guys my final thoughts but this
is what everything looks like I feel
like the eye area looks terrible I mean
I'm looking in the mirror right now and
I'm like really you're gonna go to work
like that it just looks so uneven and
patchy it's patchy where I applied is
the blush the only area that I really
like is the lip area it feels slightly
oily so I don't know how long that's
even gonna last on my lips but I mean it
looks okay I don't even think this would
be friendly if you're like a beginner
and makeup kind of like I am I don't
even think this would be friendly
because it's hard like you have to sit
there and blend blend blend so not
impressed and for $18 are you kidding me
like this should be this should be $6
this should be $6 $3 this should not be
almost $20 that is ridiculous so so far
my first impressions are no I'm sorry if
I seem like I'm coming off as a real
Negative Nancy here but I'm really not
impressed I really don't like it how
this turned out at all so anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed the video I really
should start to doing first impressions
um after work when I get home but yeah
I'm really not impressed I don't think
this looks good at all I'll be back in a
week to let you guys know what I think
final thoughts but yet so far know if
you picked up this palette let me know
what you think of it down below in the
comments section and I'll see you guys
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
