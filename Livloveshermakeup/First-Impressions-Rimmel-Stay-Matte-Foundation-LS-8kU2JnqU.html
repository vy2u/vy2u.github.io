hope you guys are all having a fantastic
Sunday so far I normally just post like
my fails and holy grails
on Sunday but today I'm also doing a
first impressions and I hope you guys
don't mind hold on a sec let me grab
something I hope you guys don't mind
that today I'm doing me first
impressions and also I'm doing a first
impressions tomorrow I will be posting
two videos today and then two videos
tomorrow as well so I hope you guys
don't mind but this video is going to be
first impressions on the Rimmel London
stay matte liquid mousse foundation my
shake is zero one zero liked porcelain
and then tomorrow and also going to be
doing a first impressions on the NARS
Velvet Matte skin tint with
broad-spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen and the
reason I'm so like in doing first
impressions right now is because my
combination skin is starting to change
and I'm starting to get a little more
oily and I'm really into trying to find
like a nice matte foundation that I'm
gonna be able to wear during the summer
so I hope you guys don't mind I
originally was actually going to make
this into a it's on sale is it worth it
video because this Rimmel stay matte I
actually picked up with the Laura Geller
Foundation and also these Smashbox BB
water but the reason I decided not to do
it it's on sale is it worth it is
because this was only marked down like
one dollar from $4.99 to 399 I feel like
it's a very very affordable in the first
place like it's under $5 anyway at full
price so I just thought those kind of
videos would be better for like you know
pricey your items like the Smashbox and
the laura geller so anyway we're gonna
do a first impressions on this product
I'm really really excited because like I
said my combo skin is starting to change
over and get a little more oily so I'm
really hoping to find a nice foundation
that I'm going to be able to wear during
it the warmer months so yeah this has
one fluid ounce of product in it which
is crazy because it looks like it
doesn't it's a really small little
squeezy bottle but this is supposed to
be a full coverage foundation and yeah
let me read a little bit about what it
says on the back it says featherlite's
liquid mousse blends flawlessly for
natural-looking all these shine control
it says silky smooth formula leaves they
perfectly match baby soft finish
lightweight texture won't feel heavy or
greasy so I feel like that's a lot of
claims because usually we
you get like a full-coverage foundation
or like a mat foundation it does feel a
little heavier on the skin but I guess
we shall see right now on the alto shaam
website it will link below where you can
pick the products out if you're
interested I think they have like seven
genes available which really isn't a lot
um probably like some of them are sold
out but like I said it is 399 right now
which is like ridiculous like 399 for a
foundation you do get a whole like fluid
hopefully a whole full ounce of product
here which is I mean the standard amount
for a foundation and yeah I feel like
this will hopefully be a good one so I'm
just gonna shake it up really quickly
like I said my shade is zero one zero
out like porcelain and we're just gonna
see how this goes on to the skin I have
already cleansed my face okay sit there
I put like that amount on the back of my
hand it looks like it's gonna be a good
shape match which is exciting
I have already cleansed my face with my
Bernie skin acted micellar cleansing
water that's the only thing I have on my
skin I did not put any skin care on or
any sort of primer because I want to see
how this is going to wear and if you
guys are unfamiliar with my first
impressions videos I will be back in
exactly a week to let you guys know how
this product worked out for me so anyway
I'm taking my Real Techniques damp
sponge I'm just gonna tap into the
product and its really really Lucy can
you guys see that this immediately
reminds me of my Tarte Amazonian clay
full coverage foundation the shape match
and also just the texture of it so let's
go ahead and start to apply this wow it
is a very full coverage can you guys see
that like a very full coverage and I'm
liking this shade match already which is
great because normally I feel like the
drugstore doesn't always have super
super light options available for fair
skinned girls so I am liking that
already for sure it's already starting
to kind of cake up around my nose area
just wanted to point that out I do have
like I said humble skin so I tend to get
a little more oily in my t-zone and then
a little more dry on the outer
perimeters of my face okay I like this a
collar because it doesn't pull like a
yellow undertone but it also isn't
pulling a pink undertone it really just
has a neutral undertone so
if you are fierce like skin and you
really want to find a good shape match I
recommend light porcelain because I feel
like it could go either way it could go
pink or it could go like yellow right
now it's just very very neutral so no
matter what undertone you have this
might work for you
so what I'm seeing right away is that
the coverage is like insanely good it
actually is looking very similar on my
skin as the tarped full-coverage
Amazonian clay 24-hour foundation and I
really like that I wonder if this is
going to be a dupe for that product I
will let you guys know of course when I
do my follow up first impressions review
but so far the like coverage is really
really nice I do notice it's being a
little dry around my nose area um which
is weird because I do you have combo
skin so I'm usually a little more oily
in my t-zone but I really like the color
match I think this is probably one of
those foundations if you have combo skin
if you have dry skin and I think if you
have dry skin you're probably not gonna
like this because it's really going on
there and it's drying very very matte on
the skin like I might not even need to
set this in with a powder but this is
one full layer like one squirt of the
tube and I feel like this is like a
sufficient amount of coverage for me
like I don't need to go back in I will
try and build it up on my cheek area
where I have some acne scarring so we
can see how the product builds let me go
ahead and take a little more so I'm
taking about that amount now I'm gonna
see if it can build up without getting
cakey but yeah it's a very very matte
formula it is building nicely without
looking cakey but it's actually starting
to get a little like stuck around my
nose area so I don't know what that's
all about I think this is probably one
of those foundations that you do want to
wear like a nice moisturizer with and
also definitely like a primer I'm
thinking a nice like silicone primer
would really allow this foundation to
look its best
like the what is it the too chic lot
from YSL or the dupe for that which is
the maybelline baby skin I feel like
this would go really really well with
this foundation
because it's like hella mad like
literally I don't even think I need to
powder my face I will still because I
want to see what it looks like because
it might actually look a little tacky
when I do it now because it's really
drying down Matt if you at least can I
think you're gonna love this if you have
dry skin I think you should probably
stay away because it is actually
starting to kick up a little bit on
certain areas of my face where I have a
little more dry skin kind of around this
area and also my nose area where I
actually am oily so that's interesting
but the coverage like hella yeah that is
good coverage for the drugstore this is
comparable to the Loreal Pro matte for
coverage I would say it's definitely
like full coverage for sure alright so
that is what it looks like just with the
product on its own it is starting to
show a little bit of my pores I feel
like it's sinking into the pores around
the sides of my nose but I feel very
matte right now like I feel like I could
definitely wear this in the summertime
without it being an issue now I don't
necessarily feel like it's super
lightweight they did claim that on the
back that it's lightweight it doesn't
feel heavy or greasy I don't feel like
it feels greasy whatsoever it feels very
very matte however I definitely feel
like there's product on my face because
this is full coverage alright so I'm
sorry let's go ahead and just I want to
just make sure I don't know I'm trying
to get rid of like that like texture
around my nose but I don't know how to
get rid of that I think just using a
good moisturizer and primer would do
alright so that is like one even layer I
did build it up a little bit on my cheek
area I think it looks really good like I
probably would not have to set this in
with a powder but I'm going to anyway
because that is what I normally do with
my foundation so I'm gonna go in with my
essence all about Matt 16 compact powder
which looks like this and I'm going to
be taking my Tarte err buffer a
foundation brush and I'm going to be
swirling into this product and then
stippling this on to my skin and I don't
feel like this is going to change the
actual finish of this foundation too
much because it already does dry down
very very matte
actually it's starting to yeah okay so
I'm immediately seen that when I'm
putting the powder on it's starting to
look a little cakey in areas where I
have some fine lines which I'm not
really surprised about but yeah this is
probably one of those products less
powder is more because it's already such
a matte foundation I actually think it
looks worse when you're putting the
powder on right now let's see here it's
just starting to get a little caked up
like in certain areas I can see texture
I can visibly see that I have foundation
on my face and lately I have not really
been into that I've been wanting that
kind of like natural look where it just
looks like skin and this does not look
like skin by any means so I'm gonna go
ahead and stop with the powder
um but yeah this is what it looks like I
mean really really nice color match
because it's not pulling like a yellow
or a pink undertone I can definitely
tell I'm wearing foundation I feel like
I'm wearing foundation but wow this is
like Halle matte if you have oily skin
or even combination skin that gets more
oily during the summer time I actually
think you would really really like this
so I guess I will be back in a week to
let you guys know how this holds up
throughout the day what my favorite way
to apply it is and um yeah I'm thinking
I'm probably gonna try it not tomorrow
because I'm gonna try the NARS but I
think I will try and apply this in a
couple of days with like a brush or with
my fingers to see how it looks I know
that when you apply it with like a damp
sponge it does shear it out a little bit
but I'm curious to see I'm curious to
see if there's a better way to apply
this because I'm not actually liking how
this looks right now I mean it looks
nice like full coverage but you can see
areas where it's like clinging to
certain patches of my skin so anyway I
will be back in a week delish guys no
you know what this foundation is doing
for me if it's doing anything and yeah I
will see you guys then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
