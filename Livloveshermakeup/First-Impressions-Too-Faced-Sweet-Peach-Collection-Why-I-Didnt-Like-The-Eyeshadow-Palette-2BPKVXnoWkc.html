thank you so much for joining me today's
video is going to be a first impressions
on the new sweet peach collection from
Too Faced so normally I would do reviews
on all of these products separately but
you guys know I'm going out of town for
two weeks I leave on Sunday so I will
not really be on YouTube I do have pre
filmed videos going up but I don't plan
on doing any filming a while I am away
so I thought I would go ahead and do a
first impressions because I actually
ordered like the fastest shipping on all
of these items one from Sephora and
three of them from the Too Faced calm
website and they just arrived here last
night so I can't give you guys a
thorough review of a product in three
days it's just not enough time so I am
just doing a first impressions today but
anyway I am very very excited the
products that I'm going to do a first
impressions on are the Too Faced sweet
peach glow this is a highlighting
palette I purchased this for $42 on the
Too Faced calm website I also purchased
the Papa don't peach blush and I got
this for $30 only Sephora calm website
and then I did purchase two of the lip
oils I got these shades peach teas and
also Papa don't peach two peas were 19
dollars a piece on Me Too Faced Calm
website you also can get them on the
sabor comm website so I'll go ahead and
leave links for those products down
below we are also going to be talking
about in this video why I personally did
not like if they sweet peach palette so
if you guys didn't know this collection
is now permanent which i think is
awesome
a lot of people loved the first
eyeshadow palette that released let me
give you guys a little bit of a
background story on that if you don't
want to listen to this I will have
timestamps down below where you can skip
ahead to the next part or you can just
skip ahead to a certain product and then
you want to see swatch or put on at my
face so anyway let me tell you guys
about the sweet peach palette so I
waited up that night that it released
the first night to the server's were
crashing all over the place it was a hot
mess I waited up until 2:00 a.m. and
then I fell asleep and I woke up at
about 6 a.m. it had gone live and I was
able to snatch up one of the palettes so
when I first received it I thought I
really liked it but then I realized that
the formulation was a little different
than the chocolate bar palette now I
don't know why I thought that it was
going to be like the chocolate bar
formulation at the chocolate bar
formulation isn't even my favorite
formulation from Too Faced I like the 9
pan palettes the best but for some
reason because this was kind of shaped
like a chocolate bar palette and it came
in the tin packaging I just kind of
assumed that it was going to be like a
chocolate bar palette and
I did side-by-side comparisons of the
actual ingredients they are completely
different I think there were only three
shadows in there that actually had
identical ingredients to some of the
chocolate bar palette so anyway I was
just kind of not in love with the
formulation and the second part was that
honestly I didn't feel like there were
enough light and peach tones in there
half the palette was super super dark
and I am someone who personally likes to
do my makeup very very quickly in the
morning and I found that a lot of those
darker tones just got muddled up on my
eyes and I didn't like the look of it so
I just wanted to share that with you
guys because a lot of you were asking me
why exactly I didn't like that palette I
did not do a review on it and that's a
whole nother story a snapchat fan let me
know if you guys would like me to rent
about that I don't want to bring it up
here on YouTube but there is a little
bit of a backstory as to why I did not
do a review on it but I can talk about
that on sometime anyway hashtag shady
but yeah so anyway that is kind of why I
did not like the eyeshadow palette I
just it just wasn't for me now of course
everybody has different feelings I know
a lot of people loves the sweet peach
palette it's kind of like how I love the
white chocolate chip palette and pretty
much nobody else on YouTube does so
obviously we all have different opinions
things like that whatever let's go ahead
and get into the first impressions guys
all right so I do have a bunch of little
clean brushes if you guys can see right
here and I also wanted to show you when
I did order from Too Faced they did send
this little sweet as a peach um it's
kind of like a little makeup case with
the cute little peach on it I think
that's adorable and their way of saying
I'm so sorry for all of the trouble that
the sweet peach collection has caused
because if you guys didn't know this has
been a really sought after collection
not just that but also the palette was
just crazy I mean it just sold out
everywhere so quickly I feel like the
Too Faced website crashes all the time
they need new servers for sure but yeah
you did get this for free which was cute
and it says hashtag Too Faced a sweet
peach so anyway we're going to go ahead
and start putting these products on our
face or on my face I want to say really
quickly I do have a little breakout of a
what is it called
cold stars on my lips right now so I
keep reinfecting myself through my flute
headjoint every time I practice with
this little breakout here which is
really really annoying and I'm having a
little bit of dry skin but the only
makeup that I have on currently is my
brow product I do have on mascara
eyeliner and
my foundation so we're going to go ahead
and try these on so let's go ahead and
start with this little guy this is the
peach infused highlighting palette so
this is what it looks like love the
packaging it's like a beautiful peachy
light pink lacquered box we're going to
open it up and take a peek all right so
it does come with a little card here
that probably just shows you
step-by-step how to use this so it comes
in a tin package as you guys can see I
really like the tin packaging of like
the chocolate bar palettes and things
like that and just for a comparison I
did pull out my semi-sweet chocolate bar
so the size is about there so it's
definitely about half the size a little
more and let me compare it to the Too
Faced a white chocolate palette because
a lot of people thought that was small
so here is the white chocolate palette
with V I'm sorry here is the white
chocolate palette with the little
highlighting palette so anyway let's go
ahead and open it up so we do have a
nice mirror here with a cute little
peach on it which i think is adorable
and here are the three products that you
get in here you do get a blush in the
middle you are getting a highlight here
and then a light toned bronzer I can
tell right away from looking at this
that this is a base gel a formulation
which gets me really really excited
because I love baked Chalet formulations
so let's go ahead and just dig right
into it I am going to swatch it first so
let's do the highlighter first here is
the highlighter and it looks like it's
kind of like a champagne rosy tone
definitely a baked chalet formulation so
there is siwash on my hand it has a
really nice peachy iridescence to it so
let's go ahead and apply that I'm gonna
take a sigma tapered highlighter f-35
actually you know what let me just watch
all of them first so let's go ahead and
swatch the blush now by the way yes it
does have that really sweet kind of um
what are those like gummy peach rings
that's what it smells like it's a very
artificial peach scent but it smells
good alright so here is the blush in the
actual palette this is just a really
mid-tone peachy color if you are curious
this is not the Papa don't peach shade
so this is completely different so there
it is again really nice a baked shell a
sort of formulation it definitely comes
off a lot more oranjee on the actual
skin or at least on my skin tone I'm
anywhere between an NC 10 and W 10 to 15
alright and then here we have the
bronzer and the bronzer definitely leans
a little more a warm toned in my opinion
I don't know if you guys can see that
but this is going on beautifully no
patchiness
no chunk
is just a really nice baekchul a
formulation so there are the three I'm
very very excited let's go ahead and
actually start with a bronzer so I do
need to bronze my face because obviously
I look pale as right now so I'm
going to take this little guy right here
this is the bareMinerals flawless face
brush and I'm going to dip into that
bronzer and we are just going to go
ahead and start kind of applying this
onto the face all right it's definitely
pretty warm tone I don't know if you
guys can actually see that but right
away I'm seeing a lot of warmth in the
shade here and I'm just kind of putting
this all over I'm not like contouring my
face or even doing anything specific I'm
just kind of bronzing the skin up
definitely very very warm tones and I
feel like this brush is not doing the
greatest job you should probably use
something a little more densely packed
if you are going to apply this to your
face because it is a base gel a
formulation and fluffy brushes just
don't pick up those kind of products
very well alright so I like the way it
went on it definitely is nice I think
that if you have a really tan complexion
this is not going to be something that
is going to really show up on your skin
because this is very very light and I'm
pretty fair and this is looking pretty
light it's not emphasizing too much
dryness on my forehead but my forehead
is so freakin dry right now you guys
actually amazing yes how dry it is
alright so there is the bronzer it is
very warm toned it is very warm tone now
I have a cool undertone in my skin but
yeah very very warm tone so so far for
that I think it's just okay I do want to
show you guys can you see the pan there
it did hit the tiniest little bit of
hard pan tiniest little bit probably
from these watching it alright let's go
ahead and go in with a little more of a
densely packed blush brush this is
completely clean it's just a little
stain down here this is the up-and-up
blush brush and I'm going to dip into
that peach shade in the middle and we're
going to go ahead and apply this to the
cheeks definitely got a little bit of
kick up there okay
I don't even know if that's showing up
on camera this is very very light and
I'm pretty darn fair you guys so just
wanted to put that out there please
excuse my hair by the way it's been a
really long workday and I just threw it
up okay pick up a little more maybe one
of those blushes that you don't really
need to tap off the excess for this is
really light this is really really light
Wow
pigment is not completely there in my
opinion now I am fair-skinned so this is
not something that really bothers me
sometimes I do like to work up an actual
blush color but that goes on very very
light so I'm going to leave it at that
that was about what - two or three dips
in there so just wanted to show you guys
that and now let's go ahead and go into
the highlight I will also be topping
this blush with the other blush because
I want to see what it looks like so I'm
going to take my sigma tapered
highlighter f-35 brush I'm going to go
into that color tap off that excess and
let's hit right there see if we can get
some glow going okay that looks pretty
nice okay I like that I think that does
look pretty even on my complexion even
though it looked a little dark when I
did swatch it on at my hand I think that
this can still definitely be a highlight
um these are these are very light and
pigment guys I'm just going to put that
out there right away this is a very very
light formulation not a huge amount of
pigment here definitely doesn't remind
me of a typical beige delay formulation
like I'm thinking of like you know my
dior highlighters things like that they
really have a lot of pigment - this does
not fall into that category let me fix
my hair quickly driving me crazy
alright yeah this does not drive me
crazy but yeah this does not fall into
that category can you guys kind of see
what I'm talking about I feel like it's
just so so light on the skin let's go
ahead and build that up just a little
more I am tapping off the excess because
I feel
like it is slightly powdery which again
is a little strange for a bake sale a
formulation um-hmm yeah not to impress
guys not to impressed all right so first
impressions on this little guy I went
onto the hand pretty good I thought that
looks nice but I don't feel like it
translated to my skin amazingly the
bronzer definitely showed up but I don't
feel like the blush or the highlight
really did so we'll see about that
let's go ahead and move on to the Papa
don't peach blush so this is what the
outer packaging looks like and this is
$30 which is crazy but you do get a
large amount of product in here which by
the way I think you only get five grams
a product in here altogether which is
not a lot all right so here is the Papa
don't peach blush I love this packaging
I love that cute little plot blush he's
so cute or the little peach so here is a
mirror again it has that really faint
kind of gummy peach scent and here's the
actual color now back in the day of what
is it to face did release a pop it on
peach blush and it was very similar to
NARS orgasm I'm talking way back in the
day you guys this was when I was in high
school and I'm out of college now so
that was a while ago
it was a very very warm toned kind of
blush now this automatically looks
different to me I do not own the Papa
don't peach yeah Papa don't peach blush
anymore the old version but this one
does look a little different to me it's
a little more neutral toned and
definitely a little more only cooler
side so I'm going to go ahead and swatch
it here is the blush from the palette so
let's go ahead and swatch of this one so
this one is definitely more of a powder
consistency not a baekchul a consistency
it is a little more firmly press I did
get a little bit of kick up when I
swirled up my finger in there so here is
the blush swatch has a really really
beautiful glow to it I like that pigment
level so there is the blush in the
palette and here is Papa don't peach so
this one definitely has more of a rose
gold iridescent going on this is more of
a true orange II coral both of them are
pretty but as you can see they are not
similar which is good to know alright so
I'm gonna go in with a morphe angled
fluffy blush brush and I'm going to tap
in here Oh lots and lots of
oh yeah very powdery but that's okay and
I'm just going to go ahead and tap that
on to my cheek kind of over that
highlight and things like that this does
have a little bit of a oh this
definitely has a little bit of an
iridescence to it so I think it's okay
to go over that highlight again little
on the shear side and you are talking to
a girl who is quite pale herself so I do
like this I think I automatically right
away kind of prefer this over the middle
blush I didn't feel like the one in the
highlighter palette went onto my skin
very well but this I can actually see
and I think it looks really really
beautiful but I will say I don't think
that's going to show up on deep skin
tones medium skin tones is gonna be more
of like a blush topper or highlight for
you so as far as first impressions where
that is concerned and I like the
formulation I do prefer the big jala
formulation because I feel like it
really glides on nicely but it didn't
really translate to the face I mean it
swatches better this one again so smells
really good and I like the color but is
it worth the $30 maybe I will try and do
that out for you guys so just I think
this is okay as of right now now let's
go ahead and move on to the lip I'm just
going to obviously put one of these on
here is the Papa don't peach shade and
like I said these are $19 apiece here is
what the shade looks like and I am going
to have to dip in and then like
decontaminate this after I do this
because like I said I have some cold
sores on my lips right now so there is
the little peach at the top which is
adorable the applicator is just a nice
dough foot it's very very long and
slender so let's do a little bit of a
swatch aroo here I was very excited for
this because I am like the queen of
Lamoille I love comfortable lip products
so I was quite excited to get my hands
on this so here is the Papa don't peach
shade nice pigment level there and it
went on very very glossy and then the
other shade that I got is more of like a
hot kind of peach color so this is what
it looks like it is called peach tease
so let's go ahead and swatch that one as
well definitely has a little more pinky
peach neskowin on there okay lock comes
off towards the top so just make sure
that you kind of brush that off but very
pigment leva I can tell I'm going to
probably like these so here are the two
shades swatch that I got so there is the
Papa don't peach and then there is peach
tease so I didn't want to go in with
Papa don't peach so let's just go ahead
and apply that Oh mm-hmm ooh oh my gosh
this one smells the best I think this
smells the best out of the whole entire
collection mmm yeah that smells so good
goodness mmm hmm I like that I like the
way that went on I like the color I like
the pigment even though I have cold
sores right now I still feel like that
we're not relatively well um maybe you
want to use a lip liner if you do kind
of smoosh your lips together like I do
but yeah that is very very pretty I like
that color a lot so anyway guys and that
is it for my first impressions on the
sweet peach collection I would say what
is impressing me the most right off the
bat is definitely the lip creamy lip
gloss oils whatever these are called I
think this is absolutely beautiful
really really like that excited to try
out the peach cheese flavor or color I
guess you could say um as far as the
highlighting palette is concerned I
think I'm the most disappointed with
this although it does have that nice
baked Soleil sort of formulation I do
not personally feel like this went onto
the skin very well if you have like a
medium to deep complexion forget it this
is not going to show up on you in my
opinion and then they pop a peach Papa
don't peach blush I think is adorable I
do like it I like the color I think it
went onto the skin nicely but again if
you're a little more medium or deep skin
tone I'm not quite sure this will show
up on you as a blush maybe a blush
topper or a highlight so I hope that you
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me guys thank you for bearing
with me with my crazy hair and of course
my dry skin I love you guys a lot if you
