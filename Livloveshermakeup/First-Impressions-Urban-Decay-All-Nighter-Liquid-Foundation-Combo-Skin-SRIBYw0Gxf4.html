thank you so much for joining me today's
video as you can tell look about how my
hair pull back is going to be a first
impressions on a face product so we are
going to be doing a first impressions on
a new foundation or a somewhat new
foundation from Urban Decay this is
called the all nighter waterproof
long-wearing liquid foundation you do
get one fluid ounce of product in here
which is the standard amount for
foundations and it does retail for $40
on the Sephora comm website I will link
down below in the description bar where
you can check it out if you are
interested I did purchase mine during
the vib Rouge sale so I got 20% off
which is quite exciting this is supposed
to give full coverage it does have a
matte finish supposedly and also it is
oil free there are 24 different shades
to choose from and I thought the shades
flection looks pretty darn good I wish
they had a few more darker shades and
maybe a few more lighter shades but
overall I thought it was a pretty good
shade selection the shade that I ended
up choosing is called 0.5 which is
actually the lightest one now I wear
anywhere between an NC 10 and 15 in Mac
foundations and I do think that normally
I would be the second or third lightest
shade in urban decay foundations however
I occurred that this does dry down
darker and it does oxidize on the skin
just in case it doesn't dry down darker
I did go ahead and pull out a laura
geller beach matte baked hydrating
bronzer here so that I can lightly dust
this over my face after I powder but
yeah I wanted to say really quickly I do
not do first impressions the way that
most people do first impressions videos
I actually do not edit my videos here on
YouTube so it is impossible for me to
check in with you guys throughout the
day on the actual product I will be
applying half the product with a brush
and half the product with a damp sponge
I prefer this one over the Beauty
Blender if you are curious but what I
like to do to make up for the fact that
I can't check in with you guys
throughout the day is I will come back
and I will give you a full in-depth
thorough review exactly a week from
today so and that is what we are going
to do I do plan to test it with three
different primers not today but over the
course of the week the first one is the
YSL Touche Claw I also want to test it
with my Stila what is this called aqua
glow perfecting primer and then also a
hydrating primer which is the it
cosmetics feel the moment so this one's
more of a silicone base this one's more
of just like a nice tacky kind of like a
makeup extender doesn't really have a
lot of hydrating properties or silicone
in it and this one is definitely high
so I think it's good to test them out
over the course of the week and then
come back and review my final thoughts
because I know a lot of people do first
impressions and then they give you their
thought on the actual product but then
they don't check in with you again after
the you know after the fact and I always
wonder do they still like that did it
work with other you know primers
different powders things like that so
that is what we will be doing I will not
be applying any sort of primer today I
want to see how this goes onto the skin
directly I have already done my skincare
and I already sunk in completely I'm
going to move up a little closer for you
guys and I'm going to show you guys what
my skin looks like right now because my
skin is purging a lot right now and that
is because I just started using the Luna
for Rio Mini and my skin is purging a
lot so I have all of these tiny little
zips like over my forehead around my
nose area and a little bit about my
mouth as well like a little one right
there which is very strange that's how I
know my skin is purging from a product
that is new to me or whatever so the
only new thing that I've really added in
is that Luna 4ao mini and this is normal
for your skin to purge when you do start
some sort of a new cleansing device so
don't worry it's totally okay guys but
yeah let's go ahead and just get right
into it shall we so I am just going to
take the foundation this is what it
looks like it has kind of like an oil
slick effect or even a cobweb or I guess
spiderweb effect you do have a pump
which is nice we're just going to pump a
little bit out onto the back of our hand
let's see here alright so there is about
two full pumps it looks quite liquidy
which is interesting I'm just going to
go ahead and take this and start
applying it to the right side of my face
I'm just going to dot it on I do want to
take it around my eye area as well
because I'm not going to be going in
with a concealer and then we will apply
this with the Beauty Blender side now I
have heard this already looks really
really light but I have already heard
that this is pretty good as far as
coverage is concerned so I'm going to
take my little damp Beauty sponge and we
are just going to go ahead and blend
that in this looks so so so light but
like I said everyone claims that this
does oxidize on the actual skin so
please keep that in mind I know it
looked like a ghost now but we'll see
how it looks later all right so right
away I would say it's covering those
little tiny dots that I had very very
easily very very quickly
you it definitely gives a matte finish I
may not have to actually go in and use a
powder with this one I do have a combo
to oily skin if you are curious but can
you guys see the difference this is
definitely a little lighter than my
actual skin right now but I feel like
this really really evened out quite
quickly hopefully you guys can see that
alright so that is with the sponge and
that was about a layer and a half let's
go ahead and just take that extra little
bit here and we will concentrate that on
areas where I want to cover even more it
looks beautiful like the actual finish
looks really really stunning actually no
complaints under my eyes I don't have
tons and tons of dark tones under my
eyes or blue circles or whatever however
I do get a little bit of well lately I
guess there should say to get a little
bit of discoloration from my lupus flare
so that is two pumps on the right side
of my face just going to go over here
quickly make sure everything is properly
blended I think that looks really really
nice when I look into the mirror it
looks very very beautiful alright let's
go ahead and apply two pumps on the
other side so just going to go ahead and
put that on the back of my hand and then
we will do the same thing where I apply
it over here and we will use a brush
this time
mm-hmm it feels really nice too it
doesn't feel super super um I don't know
it doesn't feel super thick I like the
consistency of it and I am applying this
side with the Sigma angled kabuki f-84
brush if you guys are curious so I'm
just going to use the downward strokes
see how this goes and kind of stipple
around the eye area
I will say the shade has already started
to dry down darker on my hand can you
see that so I do feel like this shade
might actually work in the long run we
shall see once it starts to dry down I
think it's already drying down on this
side as you can see this might actually
be a good shade match after all but I
can definitely see brushstrokes right
now let me see if I can show you guys up
close can you see the areas where it's
already starting to kind of settle into
pores and into the fine lines around my
mouth here whereas on this side it's
super seamless and beautiful so I can
already say off the bat not loving the
way it looks when I apply it with a
brush so I'm going to do a little bit of
stippling motions just to see if we can
kind of go over that surface area and
try and make it as smooth as possible
but usually not going to lie up my
preferred method of application is with
a damp sponge I just love the seamless
and flawless finish that it gives so
there is two layers on this side of my
face and here is two layers on the other
side I definitely prefer the finish over
here so what I'm going to do is take my
damp sponge and just kind of tap it over
on the left side so that I can kind of
even it out with the right side so right
away right off the bat I can tell that I
do prefer it with a sponge I'm one of
those people overall that I do prefer
applying foundation with a sponge but I
just like to finish a lot more and then
I want to go ahead again and let's apply
a little bit underneath the eyes one
more time so that we can see if I can
completely cover the discoloration
around my eyes right now let me wet down
my lips really quickly they are so dry
today it's ridiculous I was practicing
this morning and I was like probably
should not be practicing my salute right
now all right
ah so yeah I have like a little bit of
darkness around my eyes right now more
so in this area my lupus doctor called
it like a little bit of like my last
month even melasma it's just darkening
like yellowing of the skin right here so
I am going to go ahead and apply a
little bit underneath my eyes and out
on my eyelids and we're just going to
see if it does how does as far as like
concealing is concerned I know that we
already applied a little bit under there
but I want to see if I can build it up
alright and then I'm going to take the
sponge I'll take the pointed end and we
shall just go ahead and blend that and
see what happens it feels beautiful I
will say it definitely dried down Matt
no question about it no question about
that whatsoever it's actually got a
really nice finish and I like that it
doesn't look too cakey on the skin like
I said right now I'm dealing with a
little bit of breakouts but also my
combo skin tends to go a little more dry
this time of year so I do a little bouts
of dryness and I don't feel like this is
really clinging to any dry patches maybe
a little bit around my nose on the side
that we applied with a brush but over
here it's not bad at all so I would say
overall I definitely can see that I
prefer it with a damp sponge over a
brush but I am pretty impressed guys now
this is starting to really match my neck
quite quickly here so it definitely does
oxidize and dry down darker than it
looks when you first apply it but really
impressed what do you guys think I think
it looks really really nice actually
beautiful alright so I am going to apply
just a little bit of powder now I wanted
to show you guys there is the little
base area where I had to put the product
on you can see it as a drawing down
darker as well which is interesting but
I'm going to just set in my t-zone a
little bit with some powder and also
I'll probably just do my whole face
really quickly because that is what I do
on a normal like day to day basis I'm
going to use my Tarte err buffer
foundation brush and I'm going to go in
with my Rimmel stay matte long-lasting
pressed powder in the shade transparent
0:01 I don't feel like I need a ton of
powder right now I actually feel like my
skin looks really quite nice and matte
but I just want to apply a little bit so
we're gonna go like this I want to set
in my eye area of course my t-zone where
I am an oily oily base I know right here
I always get sweaty above my lip guys
ever get that a little bit a little bit
of a mustache sweat alright so I'm just
doing a really light dusting all over
I'm not
like twirling in the product and
literally just stippling in there and
then applying in so you guys I must
admit this looks beautiful on the skin
it has already completely matched up
with my neck I don't know if you can see
that on camera but it definitely has but
yeah this looks beautiful this is
totally my kind of foundation where it
feels really lightweight but it gives
you a nice amount of coverage so overall
I am quite impressed this is what it
looks like so far you can still see this
area right here where I applied it with
a brush there's a little bits kind of
settling into areas around my nose and
also my smile lines right there because
I smile a lot and then right here it's
not as bad with a sponge so I would
definitely recommend applying it with a
damp sponge either your Beauty Blender
or your Real Techniques so that is it
guys first impressions wise very very
impressed I think it's beautiful I wish
it did not oxidize because I can already
see that it is starting to darken up a
little bit but as long as you get a
shade lighter I think you should be okay
I will try it with these three primers
throughout the week and I will be back
in exactly a week to give you guys my
final thoughts on this product but so
far I will say first impressions wise
very very impressed I will check in with
you guys later on snapchat today as well
to let you know if I got oily or
anything in my t-zone but you will know
everything for sure next week at this
time so thank you so much for joining me
guys I really enjoy doing this I love
doing first impressions I know I do them
a little differently but it was still a
lot of fun so I will see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
