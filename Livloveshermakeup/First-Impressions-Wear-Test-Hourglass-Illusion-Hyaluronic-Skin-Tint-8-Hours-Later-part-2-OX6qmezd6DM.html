video is obviously part two of my first
impressions on the hourglass illusion
hyaluronic skin tint this does have SPF
15 and I wear the shade vanilla I did a
first impressions or application of this
product this morning it has been about
eight hours it is currently 5:22 p.m.
here I did apply this at 9 a.m. with you
guys this morning and I'm here to show
you guys what's going on with my face so
I want to talk about a few things really
quickly and then I will zoom you in so
you can kind of see what is going on
with this foundation or their skin tint
but so far I like it you guys it is
definitely a little greasy or oily on my
skin which is kind of funny because I
have been dealing with really really
severe dry skin but this almost is a
little too much hydration I did notice
right away that it started to oxidize
after I had applied it on camera I think
you guys could probably kind of see it
as I was watching the video back I
noticed it started to get a little
darker on my skin and I would say within
an hour of my first application which
was at 9:15 a.m.
definitely definitely it has darkened up
probably about two or three shades
darker than my skin so if you are very
fair complected I would highly recommend
using a powder that maybe has a little
more of like a white cast to it I have
been catching up throughout the day with
my ELF tone correcting powder and cool
and I think it has been doing a
relatively good job I'm very impressed
with how well this is stayed on my face
for eight hours I do think it looks
quite good I definitely am having oil
breakdown in my t-zone I have had to
repower three times in my t-zone once at
about 10:45 again at like 2:00 p.m. and
then again at 3 p.m. so really started
to break down in my t-zone but I would
say the rest of my face looks pretty
darn good if you're someone who has more
like combination to oily skin and you
really don't get that dry I don't think
this is going to be the product for you
it's just so moist on the skin you know
the claim was that it was going to give
you continuous hydration throughout the
day and I really do feel like it's been
doing that so I think it looks
relatively good on my cheek area kind of
around the outer perimeters of my face
but definitely in my t-zone it start to
break down and then here underneath my
eyes it didn't do that great of a job at
concealing I did notice that it start to
crease underneath my eyes as well I do
have the beginnings of fine lines there
but around my nose area and my nose
crevice it still looks pretty darn good
so let me go ahead and zoom you guys in
so you can kind of see what is going on
here
so this is what it is looking like after
eight hours of where I am a teacher so I
am running around with children all of
the time pretty much all day long and
yeah I feel like it looks pretty darn
good so there is up close you guys can
see don't we falling in a little bit
into fine lines and wrinkles and getting
a little patchy in this area but for the
most part for eight hours you guys I
feel like this looks good so that is
pretty much difficult zooming in a how
to do out that is pretty much it for
kind of my check-in I feel like for
eight hours of where it did a very good
job I don't know this is a huge
difference between the side that I have
primer on and the site that I don't have
primer on this is the site that I don't
have primer on I feel like it looks
pretty similar to the site that I do
have primer on this one may just look a
little more matte so yeah that is it for
my first impressions on the illusion
hyaluronic skin tint from hourglass
really liking it so far I think maybe
next time I will put a mattifying primer
in at my t-zone and then use this but
yeah so far so good so I will be back to
give you guys probably a first
impressions follow-up in about a month
what I'm going to do is after I try out
like five new foundations I'm going back
and forth between high-end in drugstore
I will come back and then I will do a
video dedicated to follow up reviews so
that I can let you guys know how it
works with other products other primers
other powders things like that so yeah I
hope you enjoyed this video thank you so
much for joining me guys and I'll see
you tomorrow
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
