video is going to be part two of my
first impressions on the it cosmetics
your skin's of better see see
elimination full coverage cream I
applied this about nine hours ago pretty
much eight and a half hours ago with you
guys on camera I will go ahead and link
the first part of the video down below
if you would like to check it out if you
are curious I used two primer on one
side of my face of this side over here
on the right side I went ahead and I did
a primer with the Bobbi Brown extra
enriched vitamin base base and then I
did apply it with the Real Techniques
expert face brush and then only left
side of my face I used no primer and I
could go in with theme miracle
complexion sponge a damp one from Real
Techniques so anyway that is kind of
what's going on here I don't see that
much of a difference between a V prime
side or the not prime side I will say
definitely prefer the sides with the
Beauty Blender or with be damp sponge I
should say but a lot of you were saying
in this video that I posted this morning
I should have applied this with my
fingers I did not know when I used to
use the regular CC cream I never applied
it with my fingers but I will definitely
go ahead and try this out with my
fingers so I'm feeling just kind of mess
about this right now I'm going to zoom
you guys in so you can see what I'm
talking about because I don't think you
can see it from afar so this is what my
skin is looking like right now is live
like it's crazy so here is what my
forehead looks like it is really really
dry like I touch it and like dry skin
flakes off so and that is not that great
and through my t-zone I definitely got a
little oily I did have to touch up with
my ELF tone correcting powder and cool
which did not help with like the dry
situation it's very strange because I
thought that this was going to be a
little more hydrating than the original
formulation because it says illumination
but what they actually mended by
illumination was that it does have
shimmer or glitter particles in it now
when you do put a powder on top of it
you can't tell right away and when you
do touch up throughout the day it's not
as noticeable but I did not put the
powder anywhere near my forehead so the
second application near my forehead or
around at my cheek area when I did have
to touch up I just want you at my speed
zone because I knew that it was going to
look crazy if I went in my forehead area
so yeah this does have a little bit of
IBC shimmer or glitter in it
I really wasn't expecting I thought
there was just going to be more
hydration and more moisture but
unfortunately that's just not the case I
don't really notice the difference like
I said between the prime side and the
not prime side I think both sides just
look really really dry and I look aged
like my skin look looks aged and it just
didn't sit well so of course this is
just a first impressions I need to try
this out with different primers I need
to try it out with you know different
powders or maybe no powder I will
definitely figure it out and I will give
you guys on my final thoughts but first
impressions wise I mean color is good I
didn't think the coverage was amazing
but also like I don't feel like it were
very well throughout the day so I would
say I said right now I'm a little like
not with this guy right here my gun I
have to keep using it and see if I can
get it to work I do want it to work I
really do because I like the original
version but I was just very strange I
thought this was going to be so
moisturizing and I'm like girl there's
literally like chunks of glitter on at
my face so please let me know if you
have tried this and how you got it to
work for you but yeah this is what it is
looking like after about 9 hours of wear
and I didn't even have that hard of a
day today like I only worked for like 5
hours so that is kind of crazy to me so
anyway I hope you guys a final review on
this particular product after I do a few
more first impressions I'm going to do a
big follow-up review of all of them so I
can give you my final thoughts but so
far and likes my I'm not about it just
that is it for today guys thank you so
much for joining me and I will see you
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
