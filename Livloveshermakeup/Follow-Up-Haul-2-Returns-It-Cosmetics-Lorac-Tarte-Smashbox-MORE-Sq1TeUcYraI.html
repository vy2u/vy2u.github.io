to my channel today's video is going to
be a follow up haul I did a huge-ass
beauty haul about a week ago on my
channel
I'll go ahead and throw scuse me I'll go
ahead and throw that video up in the
cards if you would like to check it out
but I'm here to give you guys my first
impressions or my final thoughts on
these items there are two that I am
returning the first one I have already
returned it was the sister product to
the Tarte Amazonian clay highlighter
this one is stunner I also have exposed
but I returned the sparkler shade it was
chunky it was glittering I don't know if
that's because the name sparkler it just
sounds like it would be sparkly but
basically I thought that this was going
to be the same formula as the original
exposed highlight which I purchased
about a year ago it's not the same
whatsoever that one was completely
shitty very chunky glittery like I said
so I did go ahead and return that and
then I am going to go ahead and return
this as well this is the it cosmetics
your skin but better CC airbrush
perfecting powder with SPF 50 UVA UVB
protection I love that it has such a
high amount of SPF in it but
unfortunately this particular shade
which is called fair is way way way too
dark for me even when I am self tanned
which I currently am it is extremely
extremely pink yellow and orange on my
skin I don't like the actual feel of it
it's very chalky I don't think it gives
a lot of coverage I honestly don't think
it does a whole lot of anything and this
was like $20 even on sale during the
Ulta 21 days of beauty event so this is
also going to be returned but let me go
ahead and tell you guys about the rest
of the products which I am keeping so
the first item is the tarts clean Queen
vegan deodorant this is my favorite
purchase out of everything that I did
pick up it is absolutely wonderful this
is my new favorite deodorant you guys I
absolutely adore these scents I like the
feeling of it I like the texture and I
like what it does for me all day long I
am into a natural deodorants just
because I do have lupus and my
rheumatologist did tell me that I should
try and avoid products with aluminum in
them because it's not good for like the
lymph nodes underneath your armpit area
if you don't have like an autoimmune
disease or something like that I'm sure
you'll be fine with loot using aluminum
products but for me personally I just
like to stay away from them so this is
just the best deodorant I have tried
that has been natural I like it even
more than my lot vanilla I'll probably
go back and forth between the love
vanilla just because they do have more
sense to choose from but I am loving
the only thing I don't love is that I
feel like I'm going through it very very
quickly it has these smoothest and
silkiest texture out of any sort of a
natural deodorant I've ever tried so I
feel like I'm going through quickly but
it's still really really good and I
probably should have picked up another
one during the vib sale when there was
15 percent off another chart product
that I am enjoying is the Tarte app when
it says Amazonian clay full coverage
airbrush foundation in the shade of fair
honey I do like this and I think it
actually works really really nicely
buffed into the skin alone as an actual
powder foundation I think will be really
good for me during the summer time I
don't know about like setting it on top
of a foundation I feel like that might
be a little too much coverage because
this does give about light to medium
buildable coverage but by itself I
actually think it's really really
beautiful I just go in there with a
buffing brush and buff it into my skin
and last week I was pairing it together
with this guy right here which is the BB
tinted primer I really liked it too look
at that but I felt like I did get a
little oily throughout the day so now
I've been using this alone and I think
it's gonna be great for me and my combo
skin during in the summertime alright
speaking of the BB tinted primer
treatment bit baby tinted primer
treatment so this is really really
wonderful but I really feel like I'm
going through this very very quickly
I've already made quite a dent in it and
I really really have to squeeze the
bottle and I just feel like it really is
a primer it's not supposed to be what
I'm using it for which is kind of like a
BB cream but it is something that I
would consider repurchasing I wish they
made a larger tube I do wear the shade
of fair and I just really really enjoy
it on my combos skin you really only
need the size of maybe like a dime or a
quarter quarter a die probably a dime or
a nickel and you just put it all over
the face it gives a really really nice
kind of blurring effect to the skin and
also it does dry down to a powder finish
so if you are oily or compost kids you
would probably enjoy this and I have
been loving it
alright here is the other Tarte I'm
light that I am keeping the shade is
called stunner it is not the same
formula as the exposed highlight a lot
of you were saying that you got a very
chunky exposed highlight during the sale
so what I think they did is actually
reformulated everything when I first
picked up the exposed highlight it was
when I first released which was about
910 months ago it was the perfect
beautiful to metha comb slippery
gorgeous formula ever and I don't know
what the they were thinking and
they went and changed all the formulas
it's absolutely ridiculous this
other states donor is a little lighter
in color than exposed and I do like the
way it looks on my skin so I'm going to
keep this one but like I said the
sparkler shade had to go back it was not
good at all all right some skin care
that I had picked up from Mario Badescu
the vitamin A de and neck cream this was
something he is to use in college I used
it again for the first time last night
and actually this morning as my facial
moisturizer I used a BB cream that was a
little more matte today the covergirl uh
what is it called clean matte or
something like that BB cream and I
thought that this went really really
nicely underneath it and I know it's a
neck cream but it just really gave a lot
of moisture to my face today so I really
do enjoy it I like the scent and it
reminds me a lot of the cream that I use
back when I was in college the only
thing I noticed is that this is a lot
more of a thicker kind of formula and I
feel like it's gotten better I hate the
packaging on Mario Badescu products but
you know a lot of their products do work
which is awesome I also had picked up
the Mario Badescu facial spray with aloe
cucumber and green tea and the aloe herb
and rosewater I have been loving this
one for years and years and years now
but I have to say I actually prefer the
cucumber and green tea for my skin
personally I feel like it gives a really
nice boost of hydration to my skin and
it's not irritating whatsoever not that
this one is really irritating but if you
do apply a lot of lots a lot of Rose
products at once sometimes they can give
a little bit of like rash or hives to
your face I've had that happen with this
before so I use a very small amount of
this but with this I feel like I can go
hey I can reapply it throughout the day
it's nice as the settings right now so
just as a facial mess and as you guys
can see I've used those quite a bit so
very happy with both of those next we
have the NYX cleansing oil this is the
stripped off cleansing oil I have used
quite a bit of this as you can see
probably just have two or three more
uses left there wasn't a lot of product
in here and actually I got one for 50%
off so I bought one and then I got one
50% off I'm going to go ahead and give
that to one of Tom's ons she wanted to
try this particular um cleansing oil out
and it really just isn't my favorite not
enough to the point where I want to go
and return the other one it's just not
like it's a very like matte kind of
product so the reason why I really don't
feel like I'm in love with it is
probably because of the fragrance in it
anytime I use a cleansing oil I expect
it to be very gentle not have a lot of
fragrance and it just be a very nice
experience for removing my makeup this
is very heavily fragrance kind of like
perfume II and I don't like that
my skin so would not repurchase this but
again not going to like return it's not
that bad I did pick up two of the
essence all about Matt fixing compact
powders you guys know I love these I've
already hit pan on the other one that I
fixed up literally a week and a half ago
that's how much I use it it's a really
good powder three dollars and 49 cents
on the altar comm website so love those
I also had picked up the charts
reinforce of the C deep dive cleansing
gel I've been enjoying the hell out of
this you guys I think it is the perfect
perfect cleanser if you do have combo
skin there is Mark huija oil infused in
here I believe so
you get that nice clean refreshing kind
of vibe because it has this kind of
citrusy scent to it and also it really
helps you feel pombal skin because it
removes the oils and impurities but then
it doesn't strip your cheeks or the
outer perimeter of your face where you
are a little more dry so this is an
awesome product would repurchase over
and over if it is so impressed that I
have been so impressed with Tartt's
skincare range I just really wish that
they would get like back on their train
with their makeup you know what I mean
like get back to some good stuff are you
two more Mario Badescu products glycolic
acid toner this is going to be great for
me during the summer time I used it last
night I'm not quite yet at that point
what yet I'm not going at that point yet
where I need to use it all over my face
if that makes sense it's going to be a
little too much for me right now in the
springtime but during the summer time
I'm going to be able to just lather this
up all over my face it really really
removes oil so you have to be very
careful but it's also very good for
exfoliating the skin if you do have dry
skin but be very careful I would use
this like once a week but it also gets
rid of breakouts oh it's something
that's a little too strong for me right
now but it did use it in my t-zone and I
really kind of gets rid of impurities
and things like that which I enjoy and
then the AG botanical body soap and
using this on my body this week a little
goes a very long way it has kind of a
chemical citrus scent which is not my
favorite but it's still okay it really
does help to exfoliate the skin and then
I also get rid of body breakouts which I
get body break I was like all over the
place during the spring and summer time
so yeah been enjoying that I also have
been loving up my Smashbox photo finish
primer waters I picked up two of these
during the sale the only thing I don't
like is that I've noticed that the caps
do actually leak if you store them like
this so what I recommend doing is
storing them upright but yeah these are
great to have a newfound love for these
again I remember when these first
release I purchased it loved it still
love it now and finally the last two
items I have here are the lorac unzipped
and unzipped and cold palette I am
obsessed with the original on step two
this is a different formula it is
beautiful the colors in here everything
about this palette screams like Olivia
it screams me so I have been absolutely
adoring this and honestly I don't even
know if I'm going to keep the unsent go
around I mean I feel like it's a really
pretty palette there are some really
nice shades in here but at the same time
it's such a different formula and I
already have shades like this in my
collection so I don't know if this will
make it through another declutter I'm
not going to go ahead and return it
because I do feel like I have a friend
who would enjoy this I want to hold on
to it for her but for the most part the
unzipped if you're gonna get one of them
get the original one so anyway that is
mine follow Apollo I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me guys and I'll see you
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
