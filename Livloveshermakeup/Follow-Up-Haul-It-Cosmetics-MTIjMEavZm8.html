thank you so much for joining me as
always I hope you guys are having a
fantastic day this video is going to be
the long-awaited follow-up hall on the
it cosmetics products that I had picked
up about two weeks ago I did a video
where um basically I just showed you
guys kind of give you my first
impressions did a few swatches because I
had picked up a few things from it
cosmetics mostly because they have a lot
of holiday kits out right now and it's a
really really good deal a lot of you
commented in the comments section to go
ahead and check out QVC and I did make
um an account with QVC so now I feel
like I'll be able to get even more like
begging for my back if that makes sense
but anyway this is kind of long awaited
normally I do my follow-up halls about a
week after i have used everything but i
didn't get to use everything within the
first week after doing the video so that
is why it's going up today I'm sorry it
is a little later but i have used
everything now more than once and i
wanted to let you guys know what I think
so the first thing I want to talk about
is the primer that I picked up this is
the it cosmetics feel the moment
anti-aging ultra hydrating sensory
awakening primer serum that is quite a
mouthful it looks like this and I
believe this goes for forty or fifty
dollars is quite an expensive primer and
I thought I think I said in the video to
I was like oh come on like plastic
packaging in this small amount of
product for fifty dollars it just seems
like it wasn't going to work for me but
i have to tell you guys I love this
primer everybody says a little goes a
long way and I could not agree more um I
the first time I use this I put on a lot
I put on like a full dropper full and it
was because I was having dry skin and I
thought oh well this says it's very very
you know hydrating what not I need to
put a lot on I put a lot on and let me
tell you I couldn't even put my
foundation over this it literally
started melting right off this is filled
with a lot of oils it has caviar extract
hydrolyzed collagen peptides hyaluronic
acid vitamins a c and e it also has
argan oil hobo oil avocado oil and deep
ocean water that's a lot of oils in
there and that will break up your makeup
if you put too much of this on so now
what I do is I literally take it and I
don't even use the dropper I run my hand
down the outside of the dropper and
that's how much product i will use for
my entire face it's great right up under
the eye area it's beautiful it really
really hydrates and it does have quite a
nice sensory awakening smell to it it
smells very much like a spa like very
very kind of herbally and beautiful so I
do like the scent um again I wish this
was a little glass jar I feel like it
mean it looks like the last jar but just
for like the amount of money I spent on
it I'm like come on this should be in a
glass jar but it's very very beautiful I
think it's very pretty to look at it's
got kind of like a pinky sort of color
to it but i really recommend this for
anybody who has aging skin anybody who
has dry skin if you are extremely oily
you're not going to like this it's going
to be too much for you is going to be
too hydrating but if you have
combination skin I could see you also
liking this so I really really enjoy
this product I'm very very happy that I
picked this up and it is definitely
worth the money alright the next thing I
want to talk about is the little um
Jonah's a cwock hits that I got I got a
little duo and basically I believe this
is still going on it's basically like a
holiday priced thing and I can't
remember if it was like twenty eight
dollars for both of these it was
something around that so basically
you're getting two for the price of what
one normally would be but this is the
agenda c quoi this is the vitality gloss
stain and this one is the vitality lip
flush really really enjoy these products
these are the kind that adapt to your
lip color based on like your ph and also
how warm your body is and i have to say
this stain is really really awesome when
you combine the two of these you get a
really really flushed pink look to the
lips and it gets quite glossy if you top
it with this normally I wear this one on
the bottom and then I'll top it with
this and it gets even more pink when you
put this on top but the product that
everybody everybody raves about is the
vitality it's called the lip flush which
looks like this and it basically it just
adapts to your skin tone it goes on kind
of clear I'm not going to swatch okay
because you guys won't even like be able
to see what it really really looks like
it takes a few minutes to kind of warm
up but i do want to let you guys know
that they're absolutely is a dupe for
this product and it is from ELF this is
the lip glow and this is in the shade
perfect pink it's got
same sort of concept going on and I have
tried wearing um this one on my bottom
lip this one on my top lip this one on
my bottom lip and this one on my top lip
and literally I can't tell the
difference these really have obviously
not the same packaging and they don't
even really look the same I'm just by
you know straight on looking at them you
can see that the lip elf one is a little
more pink whereas this one looks
completely clear but I have to say the
minute I put these on my lips they have
the same sort of glossy texture they
just look absolutely beautiful and they
give a beautiful beautiful pink pout but
there is a big price difference i
believe this is twenty-eight dollars the
one from it cosmetics um is it twenty
eight dollars i want to say is
twenty-eight dollars i believe is
twenty-eight dollars just by itself and
the elf lip glow is six dollars on the
elf website so if you do want to try out
the Jeunesse a quad but you don't want
to spend the money i believe its twenty
eight dollars i really should have
looked it up ahead of time but i think
it's either like sixteen or twenty eight
dollars or something like that either
way no matter what the price is the elf
one is cheaper for six dollars so if you
are into the jonas a quoi or if you've
heard amazing things like i have
definitely try out the elf one first and
see if you like that and then you can of
course have this in issaquah as well if
you want to but they basically give the
exact same ah look on the lips and i
think both of them have actually really
really beautiful packaging so anyway
when I wear them I do like to go ahead
and also where the gloss on top it just
gives even more of a beautiful pink sort
of pout to the lips and it's very very
classy and beautiful so I'm very very
happy with this little set I still you
know even though the elf one is cheaper
and basically the exact replica of this
one I still love having the two of these
and it was a great deal that little kit
alright the next thing I want to talk
about is the bye bye pores poreless
finish HD micro powder oh my gosh you
guys oh my gosh oh my gosh and my friend
melly here on youtube said to me too she
was like it's the best on the market and
i have to agree with her if you are into
HD powders or silica powders things like
that this is the best on the market
she's totally right it is amazing it has
sort of like a yellow
um a yellow tint to it it is in the
shade translucent as you guys can see
but I hope you can kind of see there is
a little bit of a yellow tint to it so
it does not leave a white cast on your
skin I normally don't get white cast
anyway just because I'm very very pale
and you normally can't see it but I know
a lot of people who have medium to deep
skin tones complain about HD powders
leaving a lot of flashback like in
photos I don't seem to get that but also
they have an issue with having like this
white cast or like a white halo around
the pace I do not have this that kind of
issue with this product and i have to
tell you guys it's amazing my favorite
way to use it is to use the buffing
technique which is after you've applied
everything all of your powder your
highlight your blush everything you go
in and you take a powder like a loose
powder or a pressed powder you put it in
there and you use something like this
basically a buffing brush this is from
morphe it came in a little kit that i
got it's really nice because it's not
too dense it's very very soft and it's
like a flat top kabuki and I just take
this and I buff it in circular motions
this stuff does fly everywhere like
literally it's like you put your brush
in and it's like both everywhere
everywhere okay so make sure to kind of
I mean I was going to say close your
nostrils I don't really know how you
close your nostrils but make sure not to
like breathe in too much because I get
the feeling that that can't be very very
good for you but what I wanted to say is
it leaves the most beautiful finish on
the skin I wore it all last week I'm
wearing it today using the buffing
technique and I think it just picks up
beautifully on the camera it's not like
it gives any coverage but it makes fine
lines disappear makes your pores
disappear it's the best on the market if
you guys watch the declutter video i
posted two days ago i did my brow
products my setting powders and also my
concealers I've got rid of every other
HD powder that I had the one from NARS
the one from NYX all of those so that I
could have this this is the only one I
want to reach for now so absolutely
absolutely recommend this if there is
one thing that i recommend out of this
whole hall that you absolutely must get
the next time you see like an it
cosmetics little shelf or something at
Ulta it's the bye bye pores poreless
finished HD micro powder Mellie did also
tell me
that they have a pressed version of this
I'm on it I will be trying that next
absolutely but I'm always going to have
a little tub of this laying around it's
that amazing it does come with a little
powder puff as well again I don't really
want to open this because it will poop
everywhere but it comes with a tiny
powder puff and if you press this into
the skin right on the areas where you
want to cover your pores they will
disappear in like two minutes so really
really awesome product it is my favorite
out of the whole batch it's really
really the best that i got and i highly
recommend alright and let's see here i
think we're on to the last little
product so the last product was also
another little lip kit and it was
actually called like the perfect it girl
perfect red lips kit or something like
that and again i think that you got the
lipstick and then you got like this nice
little waterproof lip liner for
basically the price of just the lipstick
so definitely check out their holiday
deals and things like that it cosmetics
is a little pricey and also check out
QVC because you can get more you know
stuff more bang for your buck basically
but anyway it is called the it girl
blurred lines lipstick and this is what
it looks like beautiful packaging it's
got this kind of iridescent but this is
what it looks like I was wearing this
yesterday with the lip liner and
everybody was commenting I love that red
lip on you things like that thank you so
much you guys are so sweet but this is a
beautiful beautiful red shade it is
absolutely absolutely gorgeous it is
just that perfect red color it has a
blue undertone so it really kind of
makes your teeth look whiter it just is
so flattering and I think it would be
beautiful on everybody so that is what
it looks like I'm bringing with I'm
bringing this product with me um for the
holidays for Christmas because I'm
wearing out on Christmas like that is
Santa Claus want me to wear that ok it's
like the perfect red color um but anyway
I do use this lip liner with it as well
this also came in the little set this is
the y el bebe your lips but better
waterproof lip liner stain and this is
in Cherry flush beautiful beautiful lip
liner I need to get like a full size of
this or a full size of any of these lip
liners they're fantastic they really
really glide on without tugging at all I
can get a really really nice like ring
around my lips and then
just put this product on the inside I
haven't really tried it yet where I fill
in all the way with the lip liner but I
don't notice that this travels anywhere
if I am wearing this like on the outer
perimeter of my lips so let me swatch
this to you guys can see this they
really really are a nice color match
together they have the same undertones
are just absolutely beautiful so there
is the lip liner and there is the
lipstick so absolutely gorgeous i love
the kind of glossy finish that this
lipstick has i think it's stunning and
yes i have a lot of reds I have a lot of
orange Reds I have a lot of blue Reds I
have a lot of things with different
undertones lots and lots of Reds but
this is the perfect red okay and i
absolutely love the formula it doesn't
dry out my lips it's not mad it kind of
stays a little glossy it's just
absolutely stunning so I really really
love that little set as well so as you
guys can see I was happy with everything
that I picked up if there is one product
in here that I would recommend that you
go out and get right now it would
definitely be the bye bye pores poreless
finished HD micro powder like I said my
friend Mellie did tell me the pressed
version is just as good so you could try
either of those but that is the one that
I would say definitely definitely try
out if you're going to get any of the
items from this hall but overall I'm
happy with everything I enjoy everything
I feel like my money was well spent and
yeah so that is my follow-up hall on the
if cosmetics video that I had posted at
two weeks ago I will link the video
below if you guys want to see me kind of
unpackaging it and are unpacking it I'm
bagging it and whatnot it did come with
cute little like the genesee qua duo
came with like an adorable little like
pink pouch and things like that they
have some cute stuff going on for the
holidays so anyway I do hope that you
guys enjoyed this video thank you so
