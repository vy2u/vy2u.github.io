thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having a fantastic day if
you are wondering if my hair is up there
it's still there anyway in today's video
I am here to give you guys a quick
little follow-up haul on the little late
night Turbie twist haul that I did from
Ulta about a week ago was it a week ago
it may have been longer than a week ago
but I did a haul where I picked up some
items and I'm here to share with you
guys what I thought of them what I'm
thinking of them so far look at this
shirt
yes I'm sure giving me life I got this
on HauteLook and every time I lift my
arms they feel like I'm flying anyway
let's go ahead and get into this
follow-up haul so the first thing I have
picked up was the otx
intensely invigorating + eucalyptus mint
a body wash and I only use the smallest
amount of this as you guys can probably
tell like literally like a very small
amount and the reason for that is
because it is a gel you do get on 19.5
fluid on so as a product in here it
smells really really good it smells a
little different when you're using it in
the shower I will say but a little goes
a really long way because it is gel and
I feel like it's definitely worth the
money I really like it I find it very
like invigorating but at the same time I
think it smells a little more eucalyptus
even mint I guess there was expecting
more mint than eucalyptus but it really
just felt strongly of eucalyptus so if
you don't like that scent it kind of
smells like an ugh SEMA products like
they're really really strong like
eucalyptus scent if you don't like that
then you probably would not like this
body wash but I personally like it I
think it's nice anna has tea tree oil in
it as well which can help with like a
breakouts on your chest and bacteria if
you need time to get those I get those
like during the lip but cannot speak I
get those during the warmer months like
I get like back knee and then like
breakouts on my chest and my neck and
just like areas where you don't want
breakout so I think this will be helpful
as well just put a little bit on a
sponge and really really lather self
nicely so I do like this so far if you
are not a fan of like a eucalyptus very
very strong eucalyptus II sort of sense
you would not like it but I like it
alright the next thing I
picked up was one of the odx penetrating
oil this is the healing + vitamin e
penetrating oil I do like this one I
will say I'm liking the coconut miracle
oil one a little more again a little
goes a long way with these products you
can probably like barely tell that I've
even use them that I have been using
them I want to get out of the shower on
damp hair I do like the vitamin E one
this one is definitely a little more
liquidy and lightweight I feel like it
does sink in really really quickly on my
hair and I can use it like in my root
area which is nice normally I can't take
any sort of product or oils especially
like on my roots but I can do that with
the vitamin E one so I do like it it
definitely helps with frizz I don't
notice like a huge difference in like
texture or like kind of making my hair
nice and silky but I do like it however
like I said I am preferring the other
one that I got which is the extra
strength damage remedy coconut miracle
oil penetrating oil so the miracle oil
is like one of their new I was gonna say
flavors it's one of their new sort of
sense you know how they come out with
like everything they have like they
literally every time I go to the leg
look at odx like the line in general on
the ELSA calm website they always have
something new so anyway this is the
coconut miracle oil it has the little
rainbow prints on it it smells like
vanilla and coconut mixed together which
is like a really like heavenly godly
compo like they are meant to be together
they were really really smell good
together so I really like this scent the
vitamin E one doesn't have a scent and
I'm a big event person so I mean I hate
to say it but that's kind of the reason
I like this one better as well but I do
like this one
it does have coconut oil in there and I
think coconut oil is so nice on the hair
I'm one of those people I have very very
fine hair and I can't really take like
pure coconut oil and just like lather my
hair up in it it just doesn't really
work for me because I do have kind of
fine flimsy hair so I like this because
they feel like it's definitely a watered
down version of coconut oil but I feel
like it sinks in really quickly it
doesn't weigh my hair down and I don't
get any sort of weird like residue with
it if that makes sense so I have been
enjoying that as well and then the other
item is in my shower and that item is
the lavender lumen
since blonde shampoo oh my god also from
otx I've been using that all week I'm
like in love it's a beautiful beautiful
shampoo I can't really say it's doing
the lot for like my hair right now
because I'm so overdue for colouring if
you guys are curious I have a hair
appointment next week and I will be
chopping my hair to probably my
shoulders or shorter and then we're
gonna go umm excuse me
talking too much and then we're gonna go
like really really blonde or just kind
of like touch up my roots I don't want
to go like super super crazy platinum
right away so we're just kind of work
the color up but anyway so yeah I've
been talking about that on my Instagram
a little bit so that's kind of what we
decided - my shoulders um anyways where
is it going with that okay the blonde
blue Vanessa do she approve really
really nice it smells like chamomile and
lavender mixed together it has a really
thick like jelly sort of formula to it
which I thought was really strange it
doesn't feel like a shampoo but it does
lather really nicely so it's like a
thick purple jelly and I think that if
you do have blonde hair for me
personally I think with blonde hair
you're better off getting a purple
conditioner because that's something
that's gonna stay in your hair a lot
longer than the shampoo kind of like
with face washes you know the ones that
say that they're like anti aging and
stuff like that you're probably better
with just going and using retinol
overnight because a face wash only stays
on your skin for so long so it's the
same thing with like a shampoo it's only
gonna be on your hair for so long so if
you do have really really blonde hair
and you do want to keep it quite silvery
instead of yellowy I deal with
brassiness all the time in my hair like
all up in here okay it's all of them
like really golden and really really
yellow so I do like it I just leave it
in a little bit longer and I feel like
it really does clean my scalp well it
doesn't like moisturize it or anything
like that
I do find sometimes the OGX shampoos can
be slightly drying so I do recommend
mixing in maybe a dollop of like oil in
there but for the most part I'm really
really liking that one I'm sorry sorry I
don't
I'm sorry I'm sorry I don't have it here
to share with you guys but that's
because it's in my shower alright and
then the next thing I had picked up was
the essence all about Matt fixing
compact powders I picked up two more of
these these are like 399 at Ulta I'm so
obsessed with these I used it today to
set in at my tinted moisturizer I love
the way it looks on the skin
it just looks so mad and he evens out
your skin it's beautiful really really
enjoy this so yes I've been loving that
and then the last thing that I picked up
from my little Ulta haul was the I just
shook it but you can't see how much I
use that I've used probably about that
much um this is the philosophy pink
frosted animal cracker yes pink frost an
animal cracker this is the shampoo
shower gel and bubble bath
I love the three-in-one products from
philosophy I talk about them a lot
although they are highly fragrant I
don't find that they ever irritate my
skin whatsoever and I've been in the
Lucas lair up the past two weeks
oh the past week and a half-ish and
honestly I can use this on my scalp I
can use it as a bubble bath I've been
using it to clean my makeup brushes and
I love it I don't have any skin
irritations from it and I think it's
just a fantastic product and this smells
amazing it just smells like you don't
know it's just smells so good okay you
can imagine pink frosted animal crackers
so anyway so that's my little follow up
all and really enjoying everything that
I got I would say the only thing I'm
slightly disappointed in is probably the
OGX the vitamin e penetrating oil and
it's not because it's a bad product like
it's really a lot better than a lot of
leave-in products that I have in my
collection I just kind of expected a
little more because I do love the
penetrating oils and healing like serums
that they have from the OGX line so I
don't know I was expecting a little more
with this one but I'm in love with the
coconut miracle oil line ok smells so
good so anyway I hope you guys enjoyed
this follow-up all thank you so much for
joining me and I will be back tomorrow
to share with you guys my fails and
holla grails for the past two weeks see
you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
