thank you so much for joining me this
video is going to be a follow-up hall
I'm kind of excited I think this would
be really really fun to start like a new
series on my channel I do a lot of halls
and a lot of people ask me after I have
filmed the halls you know they ask in
the comments section do you like the
products what do you think of them all
this kind of stuff and I thought it
would be fun and someone did request
that I do a follow-up hall on my video
that i have posted i think it was like
last weekend or something it was on the
twenty-fifth of august i believe and it
was a mac sephora and alcohol and
somebody requested could you just do a
separate video on what you think of the
products so um if you guys like this
idea please let me know I think it would
be fun to do follow-up calls about a
week after I haul the product so after
you know about a week after I show you
guys the products i can give you guys my
opinions my thoughts kind of first
impressions on what i think of them and
yeah so anyway this is going to be like
i said they follow up all for the video
that I did on I really think it's the 20
but I'm gonna be I'm gonna feel very
stupid if it wasn't the 25th but it was
my hall that was Mac sephora Alta so i'm
going to show you guys exactly um like i
did in that video i'm going to try and
go in order and show you guys the
products and what I've been thinking of
them so the first items that I mentioned
were from Mac and that was let's see
here the macworld lip pencil and also
the Mac matte world lipstick I am
wearing them today so my thoughts on
these so far like I said I've had them
for about a week and I have been liking
like a darker lip this past week I've
been liking to different products when I
will show you a lipstick towards the end
of this video to that I've been liking a
lot that's kind of in this color range
but basically this has not been my
favorite like i said i am rain it today
and i think that this takes a really
really cool like grey tone on my lips um
i think that the lip pencil and the
lipstick both have kind of a not
anything like a rough texture but just
like they're hard to work with they're
very matte they can be quite drying
yes the color is absolutely beautiful
and obviously I am NOT Kylie Jenner um I
do not have beautiful tan glowing skin I
am quite fair so um this particular
shade the world shade does not look the
same way on my lips that it does on
somebody who has darker skin I think if
you have darker skin it looks better
honestly um I think that it's okay i am
gonna work with it i will use it it's
not an issue but today like i said i am
wearing the lip liner and the lipstick
and I just I'm not in love with how it
looks on my lips I think it takes a lot
of gray tones instead of like having
more of like a pinky undertone I think I
look better with a brown lip that has
kind of pinky undertone so these
actually have not been a favorite of
mine um I just I just don't really like
the color they take on my lips and I
find them to be quite drying so that's
kind of my thoughts on those next I'm
going to talk about the product that I
got at Sephora it was the Marc Jacobs
modern noir perfume i am wearing today
i'm absolutely in love i already knew i
would be because I've tried a lot of
samples of this this is a wonderful
scent it has a lot of gardenia in it a
little bit of musk if you are looking
for a dupe for this um Pacifica makes
one called Tahitian gardenia which is
pretty darn similar but overall I just
find that this has amazing staying power
it smells fantastic and I have already
used like quite a lot because these like
that much I know its own bears like um
but I just like I would bathe in this
stuff if I could so I've absolutely been
loving the mod more perfume and then
let's move on to the things I picked up
from Ulta the first thing I had picked
up with the l'oreal hide refreshed owner
I am absolutely loving this this is
great I keep mine in the refrigerator
which is why it's kind of got like
moisture on it up the road um but anyway
I've been loving it it has a really nice
fresh scent to it I think it's pretty in
the bottle I love storing it in the
refrigerator I think that it just makes
it feeling so nice and cooling on my
skin I've been having some skin issues
this past week last week I was having I
have combination skin last week I was
having very very dry skin and this week
I'm having very oily skin mother Nature
has visited me I have quite a few
breakouts and I find that this toner
really
doesn't drive me out in my dry areas and
it doesn't make me super oily and you
know my t-zone so I'm absolutely loving
it i highly recommend I'm just I'm
really really happy that I found a great
great toner at the drugstore basically
or in the drugstore session at aalto so
yeah the hype of fresh toner from
l'oreal is awesome the next product I
had mentioned in the hall with the
Garnier clean plus nourishing cleansing
oil I've used quite a bit you guys can
see I had said I wanted to use this
product because it's kind of like a
cheaper alternative to the bow show cool
cleansing oil boscia cool cleansing oil
is much much better than this product i
have used this before so i already kind
of knew what it was going to be like but
just going from the bow show cleansing
oil to this product i just noticed how
thin the consistency is in this and how
irritating the fragrance kind of is it
has a very very strong fragrance to it
so if you have sensitive skin it's not
going to be good for you and the other
complaint I have is that while you are
pumping it I don't know how because I
swear to I pump it away from like you
know it doesn't even rub on my hand I
pump it away from my hand but every
single time I end up getting some kind
of make up at the bottom which is
disgusting and it's so gross and I can't
get it out but it ends up getting like
foundation bottom you guys so gross so
um I don't know it does remove my makeup
really really well like i said i have
used it before but the first time I used
it I hadn't even tried the
cleansing oil yet so if you have not
tried the cleansing oil yet you
might really really like this but I'm
really not that impressed this time
around I think I'm gonna have to find
something different oh it just got a
little spot of it right on my cheek it
did not like that i was saying that but
anyway so I yeah I don't know I really
thought I was going to be okay with this
this time around because i had used it
but it was just such like a shop going
from my bosha makeup break up to this so
i'm probably not going to repurchase
this i will use it up though because i
like to use my products up the next
thing I talked about in the hall last
week was the bikini zone medicated after
shave gel it looks like this I've been
using this on any area where I tend to
be sensitive when I shave so they're my
armpits um
on my legs if I get razor burn you put
this on after shaving or waxing whatever
and let me tell you it burns this is
like a topical and Melissa I know how do
you say that but it's one of those
things that has like little pain in it
like two percent so it does burn but I
will tell you it takes care of the bumps
so if you do not like having read ugly
bumps this goes in at basically like
cleans it out but it really does if you
have like an open area on the skin or
something or you're really sensitive
this will burn and staying but it works
so I like it and the other product that
kind of goes along with that is the
bikini zone and type of shave gel for
the bikini area really really been
liking this this does not burn at all
when you're shaving with it use it down
there again armpits definitely it's been
great for my outfits and also just any
areas where I tend to get really
sensitive like over my knee area or leg
down near like my heels I don't know I
that's just where I tend to get like
razor burn so I've been loving this as
well really happy with those and then I
mentioned um I picked up another little
Turbie twist headband these are great
they're like microfiber their supersoft
this month like a pillow I kind of wish
I had picked up a different color
because white is just so easy to get
dirty um but I have one of these that i
use to put on my makeup with in the
morning I have one and then this one is
the one I use when I am showering but
I'm not washing my hair so I put it in
and you can tuck all your hair into it
holds everything great and then you put
your shower cap on or whatever you go in
the shower and your hair will not get
wet at all so love that wish I picked up
a different color though and then the
last two products I picked up on this
one is the Loreal infallible eyeshadow
in 892 amber rush I've been loving this
I've been wearing this this week a lot
I'm not wearing it today but I have been
wearing it I love it it's absolutely
gorgeous it really does bring out your
eye color especially if your blue eyes
um and it's just absolutely gorgeous it
looks like it's like shiny and really
wet on my eyelid and it's just a
wonderful so I have been absolutely
loving that you guys will probably see
this in my favorites videos actually at
the end of the week and the last product
i wanted to mention is the last product
i picked up in my hall was it the revlon
super lustrous lipstick in 671 mink and
this is probably something you will
seen also in my favourites video for the
week but this was the other kind of
lipstick that I picked up that was sort
of similar to the macworld so this is
the Revlon and that's Mac and it's a
little more sheer it definitely pulls a
little more like brown on me then grey
like them active so I have been
preferring that one absolutely I beret
in it a lot this week I'm loving this
one so definitely I recommend this one
over map swirl for girls with fair skin
it's just it looks much better it's much
more flattering in yeah so anyway that
was my follow-up hall on my mac sephora
and alcohol from the last week i hope
you guys enjoyed this video if you did
please give it a thumbs up and i'll see
you in my next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
