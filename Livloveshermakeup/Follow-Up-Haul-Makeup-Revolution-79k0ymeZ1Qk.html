thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a wonderful day
today i am doing a follow-up all for you
guys on the makeup revolution products
that i had purchased at hauled and done
swatches on last week so i posted a
video where i basically gave you guys
kind of first impression swatches and
hauled all of these products it was last
week and i will link the video down
below in the description bar if you guys
are interested in seeing the products
and the actual swatches but basically i
like to do halls and then a week later I
like to kind of follow up with you guys
because I get a lot of questions asking
if i'm still using the products what do
I think of them because you guys know
when you first purchase products um you
know you get really really excited but
sometimes they don't end up working out
for you or sometimes they're even better
than you thought they would be and I
just thought it'd be fun to do these
kind of videos and give you guys an
update on how they're working for me so
um let's just get started I'm the first
three things that I had purchased where
the revolution vivid baked highlighters
I got all three so I got peach lights
which is kind of a pinky peachy color I
got pink lights which is kind of like a
violet color and i also got golden
lights so i am wearing golden lights
today you guys may be able to see it's a
very very very pigmented heavy duty
highlighter i absolutely love it this
one is my favorite out of the bunch i'm
not going to swatch these I have all the
swatches in the original haul video if
you guys are interested because I don't
have any wipes in front of me to wipe
them off on my hand but this is what it
looks like it's really really gorgeous
it's just golden and has tons and tons
or it's kind of like a white color and
has tons and tons of golden shimmer and
I have that on today and this baby is
pigmented so if you guys you know want
to use this definitely definitely apply
it with like a stippling brush or
something that's not going to pick up
too much product you definitely do not
need to swirl in there by any means
because it comes off really really
really opaque on the skin so this is
definitely my favorite one out of the
bunch I love the texture I love the
price of all of them but this one just I
love the color I really love this golden
look with like a red lip I think it's so
beautiful for the holidays so that
um definitely definitely a great one the
second one that I have hauled was pink
lights and this is my second favorite it
kind of is like a violent purpley
undertone with tons and tons of silver
shimmer in it and it's very finely
milled again and has that same texture
as the golden lights one it's really
really creamy and pigmented and
absolutely gorgeous so I'm really really
happy with this one and then the last
one I have showed was peach lights and
this is actually the one that I don't
like as much it seems to have a
different kind of texture to it it is a
really really beautiful color it really
has kind of that pinky um peachy glow on
the skin but it just doesn't have the
same texture and the same kind of
opaqueness as the other two so this one
was a little bit of a disappointment I
think the formula is just a little
different and I just don't like it as
much but overall out of the highlighters
definitely golden lights and pink lights
are the best in my opinion and I'm
really loving those to the next thing I
have showed you guys was the ultra
bronze palette in all about bronze it is
a bronzer palette that looks like this
and I am enjoying this I think it's
really really great for fair skin tones
and because there's a lot of light kind
of bronzy colors in here if you have
medium to deep skin tone a lot of these
colors are probably not going to show up
on you but you get a lot of different
finishes you get something with you know
sparkles mats all different kinds you
get some baked colors over here and
overall I really do like this I don't
like it as much as the product i'm going
to show you guys next which is the blush
palette which is like amazing but
overall I do like this and it was very
well priced so the product that I
absolutely am obsessed with even more
than the highlighters is the sugar and
spice ultra blush palette it looks like
this it is absolutely gorgeous I am
wearing this color right here which is
like a very very neutral kind of mob
undertone blush I'm wearing that on my
cheeks today and it's just so neutral
and I'm just loving this blush palette
because they have so many neutral colors
in it so it's really really great for
fall and these two colors over here are
amazing amazing blush toppers or
highlighter
and I'm just super super impressed I
think they're beautiful they have a
great creamy you know texture to them
they're easy to blend into the skin
they're extremely pigmented and I'm just
a very very impressed this is definitely
the favorite favorite thing that I
hauled this and the highlighters are
amazing and then the last thing that I
had hauled was the ultra professional I
shadow in the flawless match so this is
a flawless matte eyeshadow palette if I
can open it here there it is so these
are all Matt and you get it what does it
say 32 yeah 32 different shades in here
absolutely gorgeous you get a lot of
cool tones a lot of warm tones and these
are great like transition colors I am
just wearing one of these I can't even
remember which one it was I think it had
a little more of a pink undertone I
wearing one of these in the crease today
that's all I'm wearing um for eyeshadow
but it's just so simple and easy and I
think that if you want to put a little
depth into your crease and not wear a
lot of eyeshadows this is absolutely
fantastic for that and I really really
like that it gets into kind of smoky
colors at that end too because they
really are different and they don't all
muddle together and look like the same
color if that makes sense so really
really love this as well so overall um
that held that I had done really really
turned out while I was very very happy
with a lot of these products I would say
the must-haves are definitely the sugar
and spice blush palette i am going to be
looking up more of these blush palettes
and definitely purchasing from the altar
calm website i actually purchased all of
these on the makeup revolution websites
so i will link below the makeup
revolution website and also altus page
where they have a few of these products
but definitely the sugar and spice blush
palette are my favorite and these two um
what are they the vivid baked
highlighters in golden light and golden
lights and pink lights so anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed this follow-up hall on
my makeup revolution video I will see
you guys in my next one fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
