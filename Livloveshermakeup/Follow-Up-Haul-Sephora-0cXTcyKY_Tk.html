thank you so much for joining me i hope
you are all having a fantastic weekend i
am here to share a follow-up haul with
you guys and I like to do these on my
channel where basically if I have a hole
that I did which I did last week I had a
Sephora haul I will link below in the
description bar the original haul video
if you would like to see it where I do
swatches and everything um but I like to
do these kind of videos because I'm one
of those people I watch a lot of halls I
love halls and sometimes I watch and I
you know wonder about what happened to
those products that that person had
hauled and I'm guilty of doing this as
well where you know u haul a bunch of
stuff and then maybe you don't talk
about what you got after and you just
never hear about it ever again like you
know it just kind of like in the
oblivion or something it just kind of
sits around in your collection and a lot
of people are curious so I just think
it's fun to film these kind of videos so
I can kind of let you guys know what I'm
thinking of the products um like how how
they're working out for me basically
kind of like a follow up review like I
do with my first impressions video is
kind of just letting you guys know you
know if I played with them what I think
of them and usually when I do a haul I
like to get into my products right away
so I have had a chance to try everything
this week and yeah I just want to talk
about them a little bit with you guys
I'm not going to be sharing any of the
products that I didn't purchase like my
samples or my point perks only the stuff
that I did purchase so let's get right
into it I'm gonna go in order like I did
in the first original video so the first
thing that I picked up from Sephora was
a new Beauty Blender i did use this
today that is why it is dirty but i love
these kind of sponges i did have one and
while many before this one um and I
think these are just really really
fantastic they really have um a lot of
they just don't absorb a lot of products
they have like a lot of buoyancy to them
and I really like using one side for my
foundation flipping it over to a clean
side blending in my brightener with
and then on the bottom I like to blend
in any concealer or spots that I want to
color correct so I think that they're
just awesome awesome sponges they put on
your foundation like no other I do get
asked a lot do i prefer the Beauty
Blender or the Real Techniques sponge
and I personally prefer the real
techniques sponge I have two of those
right now and I have one Beauty Blender
and I just like the Real Techniques
better they have like this flat side one
of the sides of their little sponge to
have the flat side which i think is
beautiful at putting on foundation so I
do prefer those over this one but I like
to have a lot of them rotating around
just because you know I feel like I
don't clean them every single time I use
them so sometimes it's just nice to grab
another one that is completely clean so
I'm really really happy with that
purchase though it's so that is the
first thing that I picked up the second
thing I picked up was from bareMinerals
this is the mineral licks errs facial
cleansing oil you guys are going to see
this in my favorites video for the week
my weekly favorites that will be filmed
right after this I've been loving this
stuff it is very comparable to my bosha
makeup break up cool cleansing oil which
is one of my favorite ways to remove my
makeup personally I haven't really used
it all over my face I've just been using
it at for like I makeup and then I've
been going in with my makeup eraser for
my face makeup but I think it is really
really wonderful it doesn't really have
like an offensive smell it has a really
cushion like consistency to it and it
really really does melt away your makeup
so I've been very very happy with this
unfortunately I found this in the sale
section so I think that maybe it's being
discontinued I hope not though because
honestly that's a really really good
product alright the next little kits
that I had picked up with this only
henriksen facial wipes facial cleansing
wipes set basically and it came with
three different ones in here the first
one I want to talk about is one that
I've been loving this week again you
will see this in my weekly favorites
this is the only henriksen the clean
truth cleansing cloths these are the
brightening ones they have vitamin C MCO
q10 when I first hauled these I did not
like the smell whatsoever but now that I
really smell them and I've used them on
my face they smell like that kind of
orange creamsicle sort of scent I really
really like from there like brightening
line
um but I was using needs the wrong way
like the first couple of days I was
actually using these to remove makeup
and actually these are not makeup
removing class these are specifically
just to clean your face so if you wake
up in the morning and you don't have
time to wash your face oh excuse me oops
not a bug just flew into my throat if
you wake up in the morning and you do
not have time to UM cleanse your face
you can grab one of these and basically
run it over your face it takes up any
kind of grime that maybe you had from
the night before it also is nice for
removing any sort of like extra traces
of makeup but it doesn't completely
remove makeup so i was using than the
wrong way but i love them for in the
morning just really really quickly to
kind of wipe over my face or after i go
to the gym or you know after i've been
cleaning and i get a little sweaty or
something like that they're really
really great for that the second one
that was in here was the Olay henriksen
nurture me cleansing cloths these are
the makeup removing one sees one have
Moringa and borage seed oils hated these
is really really suck they just don't
really make up at all I feel like
they're a little different there a
little more quilted than the coq10 ones
and I really do think that these could
be a little softer but I will purchase
probably a full size of them just
because I do like what they do for my
skin but these ones were really crappy
and I'm not looking forward to using the
rest of these up they just didn't remove
anything especially eye makeup which I'm
like you know what a cloth if it claims
that it can remove makeup I always try
it on my eyes first and this just is
really really crappy it says it removes
all traces of waterproof makeup and that
is a lie okay so i don't like these i
will not purchase a full size of those
and then the last ones were the grease
relief cleansing cloths these are oil
free pour refining they have a chaise
and eucalyptus in it it helps exfoliate
clarify and refine pores really really
like these as well I think they're
really nice especially if you've been
working out or something and you come
back upstairs and you want to just like
wipe your face quickly these will
basically tone and exfoliate your skin
just take all the grime off and they
just feel really really good and they do
some
I school yeah they smell really good
like they're very strongly of eucalyptus
so if you don't like that you won't like
these but these are really awesome I've
been very very happy and I will purchase
a full size of these alright next I had
a little eyeliner kit from urban decay
that I purchased it had five different
eyeliners in it I've been enjoying these
alot these are the 24-7 glide on eye
pencil formula love them the first one
is in accuse this was a blue color I
think it's beautiful it wears very long
in the water line and then you have
perversion which is a matte black to
that I have been wearing this week and
have been favorites are delirious which
is a purple color and also this color
which I'm wearing today which is called
zodiac which is a dirty green color with
lots of gold sparkle and shimmer in it
and then you also get news which is a
beautiful kind of cool tone brown with a
little bit of shimmer in it so really
really happy with those I already know
that i love that formula so I wasn't
surprised the next thing I had purchased
was a two-faced love flush blush in the
shade your love is king I'm loving this
I've been wearing it this week I think
it's beautiful it's a deep kind of ma
fille um its a mix of it really looks
like it's just going to be a mauve color
but it really is a mix when you wear it
on the cheeks it is a mix of a dark pink
with mob so really really gorgeous I've
been loving these kind of colors this
week you guys will see this in my weekly
favorites video and I will swatch it
again but it's a beautiful blush it does
have a little bit of shimmer in it and
it just sits gorgeously on the skin and
really doesn't wear away during the day
it really really stays on the cheeks um
so really happy with that the next thing
that I had purchased was from first day
beauty this is the facial radiance pads
these are awesome I did not use them
that much this week but I will be this
coming week these exfoliate tone and
brighten they're really nice because
even though they do have a little bit of
like glycolic acid and things like that
in it it's not too harsh you can
actually leave it on your skin you can
use them in the morning and at night
twice a day without any problems and you
don't have to wash it off which i think
is great so really really love these a
lot and then the last thing I had
purchased was this little whimsical
wonder set from josie maran I'm keeping
this little bottom part of the box i
think it's so
cute the first thing you got in here was
the whipped argan oil in be joyful this
is vanilla apricot this is a body butter
it is just luxurious and absolutely
stunning it smells stunning it makes
your skin look stunning and kind of
glows I used this right away last week
after I had halted and I basically was
using it on my hands which were very
very chapped last week and it's just
absolutely gorgeous and beautiful so
really really loved that and then the
josie maran argan daily moisturizer with
SPF 47 really enjoying this a lot it
does have um you know it has like
titanium dioxide sunscreen in it so it
does kind of I don't know how to explain
it it leaves a little bit of a white cat
but it still is a really really good
product and then the josie maran hundred
percent pure argan oil love this have
talked about this a lot i have a full
size of it the josie maran argan
infinity intensive creamy oil another
product type of full size of i've talked
about a lot love it and then the last
one in here was the pure argan milk
intense hydrating treatment have been
loving this never tried it before but it
is a awesome awesome product so those
were the products that i halt i will
