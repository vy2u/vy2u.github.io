thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having an absolutely
fantastic day don't worry that is a tank
top I'm meant to wear this shirt like
this and it keeps going up like this
it's cute like this too but I prefer it
off the shoulder but anyway I am here to
give you guys my follow-up haul on the
Sephora haul that I did last week
I will link the original Sephora haul
below if you would like to see me unbox
everything and also show you guys all
the samples I got when I do follow a
pulp I don't show the samples because I
haven't gotten into those yet but I'm
going to show you guys the items that I
purchased so let's just get right into
it shall we
the first thing that I had picked up was
this Laura Mercier and body bath this is
the creme brulee honey bath first of all
beautiful beautiful packaging it is made
out of glass it's just a beautiful
little container you get a lot of
product in here and it also comes with
this little like honeycomb like spatula
thing so basically you twirl this into
the honey product and you run it under
warm water to give really really nice
beautiful soft bubbles to your bath and
I have to say it really does give a
really luxurious beautiful soft bubbles
to your bath it smells absolutely
incredible just like creme brulee and it
just has the lovely lovely consistency I
know that honey has a lot of like
moisturizing properties to it and it's
really really just fantastic in general
I'm tap on your body but I think this is
just such a luxurious product I just
cannot get over it I really am looking
forward to picking up a few of the other
things that I saw from this a-line I saw
that she has like a creme de pistach
which is like a pistachio body cream
that looks amazing some body like bath
salts just like a ton of stuff like I
never knew that she had this kind of
like bath line Laura Mercier did but
this is really incredible and just
beautifully luxurious like it just feels
luxurious so I give this two thumbs up
oh my goodness
yes I give this two thumbs up I think
it's absolutely stunning and I just love
like the presentation of it I love the
bubbles that it gave and I really left
my skin feeling soft and silky after so
I would repurchase and I probably will
be purchasing more of her like a bath
products in general all right the second
thing that I had purchased was the Becca
backlight
priming filter I'm still on the fence
about this one so like I said in the
original video I have someone I have a
friend who absolutely loves it and a
friend who hated it and I'm just kind of
right in the middle I think it actually
absolutely smells amazing my friend
Mellie was like take a whiff of it it
smell so good and it really does smell
good I like that I have a pump it you
get a whole fluid ounce in here you get
like a nice amount of product in here I
think the packaging is beautiful but
this is a very very luminous on the skin
if you have dry skin you would probably
absolutely love this because it's going
to just give luminosity and it just it's
just gonna make your skin really really
glow so my issue is that I noticed that
it makes in my t-zone where I get oily
anyway I have combination skin I noticed
it makes it too glowy
like it almost looks oily um so I'm just
not really into that I'm trying to find
a way of working around that maybe
putting less product in my t-zone or
just not putting it in my t-zone but
it's absolutely beautiful on like my
forehead area and my cheeks I think it's
absolutely stunning if you'd like I said
if you have dry skin you would probably
really really love this it really does
make your skin look luminous alright the
third thing that I had picked up was the
kaolian or Kaloyan hey Ally Pally on I
really don't know how to say it this is
the awareness pour pour blackheads team
foam cleanser and the pore tightening
cooling foam cleanser I didn't call a
review on this I will link that video
below in the description bar if you are
curious I did not like the top one which
was supposed to be like this heating
pore like steaming sort of sauna for
your face sort of thing I did not feel
like it worked very well as you guys can
see I have like hit the bottom of the
container as well and also it smells
like poison it really just does not
smell good and I'm just not into it
however the one on the bottom the
cooling pore cleanser smells amazing it
smells like mint I felt like it was
really really nice on my skin in the
morning I really woke my skin up it gave
a refreshing sort of like wake-up call
to my skin and I absolutely loved it I'm
somebody who wakes up very early every
single morning so that was really really
nice to have and if they do sell these
separately I will be purchasing a full
size of the pore tightening cooling foam
cleanser so overall the top one didn't
really work for me but the bottom one
was a success alright
I think I had picked up was from
Glenville oh this is the thirsty mud
hydrating treatment I will be doing a
video on how to pick the right glam glow
mask for your skin but this is
absolutely fantastic
if you have dry skin or combination skin
I love putting this on my cheek area I
love like multi-masking I'm going to do
a video on that as well like
multitasking with masks basically but I
love putting this especially on my cheek
area it's beautiful it smells like
coconuts and it really really does
hydrate the area nicely also it doesn't
leave any sort of residue or cast on
your skin so you can actually probably
wear it under makeup if you really
really wanted to I have a few friends
that actually use that as a moisturizer
like everyday moisturizer so that is
pretty cool the next thing I picked up
was the Korres or Korres Wild Rose
vitamin C active brightening oil I just
did my follow up first impressions
review on this product today I will link
that below and also the first
impressions video I did on it last week
this is fantastic I think it's
absolutely beautiful I would say if you
have oily or combination skin this is
such a nice pick for you as far as oils
are concerned I can wear this under than
my makeup with no problem whatsoever
throughout the day I don't notice that
my t-zone get super super oily I like
wearing it at night I find that it's
just moisturizing enough without excuse
me without being too like oily on the
skin and it really does brighten up
hyperpigmentation along my jaw line
where I have had hormonal acne so this
one is definitely a winner and look at
that isn't that cool it has actual rose
pieces in it so yeah you get a lot of
product in here I think it's absolutely
wonderful and totally works and I'm very
very happy that I picked it up alright
and then the last product that I have
picked up in my fall was the karyogram
lip lip in the shade marsala
I love these karyogram lip whips they're
wonderful they're made without petroleum
they have no mineral oil nothing heavy
that's going to it feels like it's
petroleum but there's no petroleum in
here it really really coats the lips and
just makes it feel like it's very very
protected without having anything harsh
or heavy on your lips so it's an
absolutely lovely lovely formula I have
a lot of these lip whips I have the
naked one in peppermints and also send
I have just a regular one that's kind of
tinted pink one called radiant and then
I have this one in Marsala which is
beautiful it's got a gorgeous gorgeous
kind of plummy tone to it with a
beautiful beautiful Sheen and I think it
looks gorgeous on the lips this is a
nice way to wear color if your lips are
super super dry which mine get during
the winter especially this is a nice way
to wear a little color on your lips
without you know I don't know like dude
this is a nice way to wear color without
having to not wear anything because your
lips are so dry so I really really enjoy
it I think it's absolutely beautiful and
look at that color isn't that beautiful
it's beautiful and it's got a nice
little Sheen to it as well so overall
I'm really really happy with everything
that I picked up from Sephora this was
definitely a good haul I will keep you
guys updated on some of the samples that
I had picked up I'm sure you guys will
be seeing that when I do my sample
spotlight with Meg Bernardo at the end
of the month but overall this was a very
successful Sephora haul I hope you guys
enjoyed watching this thank you so much
and up to give my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
