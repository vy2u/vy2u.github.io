last week I did a call for you guys it
was the Sephora haul and I will link
that video down below if you would like
to see all the like a boxing and
swatches of everything but I am back to
give you guys kind of my first
impressions and my thoughts on the
products that I hauled it has been one
week exactly I'm going to let you guys
know which products are working for me
which ones aren't so the first two
things I had picked up or wear these
little glam glow masks in the dual
cleanse form and also the youths mud
form format formula this is what they
look like these are little tiny ones
that are 1.25 no point five ounces or 15
grams apiece I really really love these
these are two of my favorite mass from
glam glow I just wish that I hadn't
gotten the tiny little sizes just
because I did dig into this one this
week and I was like okay I literally
used it twice and it's almost gone so
that's kind of annoying and I just wish
I had gone and just splurged and bought
the $69 mask into full size because I
think it really is worth it so that's
the only thing I'm gonna say that was
not so great about it and I really
disappointed myself because I went and
did more hauling from so far are you
guys will see that Hall in sometime this
week when I have time to post it um but
yeah I did more damage and I have been
shopping regularly at so for every
single week i think i've been doing this
240 hall every single week for like the
past three weeks i really need to stop
but anyway um I did go and I picked up
another one of these little mini ones
that I was like why do you do that so I
picked up a little thirsty med one which
is the hydrating treatment which I also
really like a lot so that's my only
regret and I guess my regret for the
next call as well is the fact that i
picked up the tiny little ones i should
just go ahead and splurge in the big
ones because i already know i love them
and you get like no use out of these so
the next two products i had picked up or
supplements um you guys gave me a really
really great feedback about this i asked
you guys if you would like to see a
whole video dedicated to some nutrition
products basically hummingbird'
nutrition which is this brand that you
can get at sephora um I was talking
about the skinny bird one I called this
and also the big Chelle skinny bird is a
supplement that
I have been taking for a long time now
and you guys were really really
interested particularly in this
supplement but also you said you would
definitely like to see a video on all of
the supplements that I have from them i
think i have almost all of them except
for two and who knows by the time i make
the video it will be up in February by
the time I make the video maybe I'll
have all of them so i will give you guys
a nice overview of the brand and also
lets you know like which are my favorite
ones but anyway I hold this one this is
skinny bird I take this two times a day
30 minutes before food it helps with my
sugar intake like it just helps cut down
on my sugar cravings basically it's got
five htp chromium in it it helps to
control your blood sugar it's just a
really really nice supplement I did warn
you guys if you have sensitive tummies
to go ahead and not take it on an empty
stomach I recommend taking it only
before lunch before dinner if you have a
sensitive stomach because if you take it
in the morning before breakfast you
might be sick to your stomach but you
can take it up to three times a day but
anyway loving it um I have a perfectly
many many times and then the other
supplement that I had gotten was the UM
Big Chill so this is basically
supplement that has role rhodiola rodeo
lab rhod I ola anyway it's supposed to
help like calm you down and things like
that you guys know I do suffer from ADHD
and sometimes I just feel like what's
the best way for me to describe my ADHD
it's like I have a television in my
brain with 20 different channels going
off at once so somebody is nice to just
um not constantly be thinking about 20
or 30 things at once and sometimes it
gives me anxiety I get a little bit of
anxiety I'm not someone who gets anxiety
over little small things or anything
like that I'm usually pretty good at
coping however when like my ADHD
symptoms are on like full drive and I
just cannot concentrate and I literally
thinking about a bajillion things at
once i do get anxiety because I mean who
wouldn't so anyway I have been taking
these for a weekend I'm happy to let you
guys know I have felt good this week i
mean i'm still obviously hyper and
whatnot
I have felt a little more like at ease
just just a little more common
especially at night when my medications
start to wear off at night that is when
I get really really hyper and I have
noticed I have been getting to bed at a
really decent hour all week and I just
not felt so like like I'm gonna burst
yeah I just haven't felt like I'm going
to crawling up the wall or something
like that you know like my energy level
has been really really nice and
consistent and not to like fluctuating
sometimes I'm really really just I mean
my normal I've got I'm going is illegal
all think about ADHD now but normally
I'm like this like how I am right now I
have a good high energy level but then
sometimes its spikes way up and then I
just can't concentrate I'm all over the
place and I've noticed that I haven't
had any of those issues this week so
that's what I was driving the same side
and we go into a little rat there but
anyway so I think this has been helping
me they say to give it about two weeks
so it could just be a placebo effect
that I'm experiencing but I will keep
you guys updated on this one and of
course i will be talking about it when i
do become nutrition veil alright the
next thing I had picked up was this
gorgeous stila palette look at that
packaging can we just like yes yes yes
yes so this is the eyes are the window
shadow palette in body and I did wear
this one time this week now when I put
my fingers in here the first thing I
noticed is that there's a lot of grit
and just kind of um texture to these
shadows which I I'm not gonna say I
don't like but I want to like rub my
finger in there and feel really buttery
things I feel like everybody nowadays
wants to feel that like you just expect
everything to be super soft like a
makeup geek shadow or like a full of
eyeshadow or something like that these
are not like that but the pigmentation
is amazing and they look really really
nice on the eyes so I'm willing to
forgive the fact that yes they're not
super creamy and buttery because I think
that they really have great pigmentation
and I think that they really show up
beautifully on the eyes and what I liked
I only wore it one day on my eyes but
what I liked was that the colors you
could see the clear difference
on my eyes so I wore that burgundy shade
and then this like slate gray shade and
you could see the difference they didn't
all just muddle together so that's what
I liked I did go ahead and doesn't make
this as my palette for this coming week
so this is the palette that i will be
playing with the whole week i will let
you guys know at the end of the week if
this was a fail or a holy grail you guys
will see that in my weekly favorites
video next sunday and i'll let you know
if this was a really really like i said
a failure a Holy Grail so far it seems
really really nice i am just like a
little iffy of the fact that it's not
super super creamy and because i find
that they're just not super super
blendable but at the same time they're
so pigmented and the colors are really
really different from each other you can
tell like okay I put that burgundy shade
on my lid or I put that slate gray color
underneath my lower lashline you can
really see the difference which I like
so right now I'm kind of like I'm not
quite sure I am going to play with it
more on my eyes and I will keep you guys
updated so all right and then the last
product that I had picked up it was this
hand soap and we have used quite a bit
of this at least that much in a week and
we have this in our master bathroom I
got this from my boyfriend basically he
loves anything truffle so this was the
nest fragrances woodland truffle liquid
soap and I was like I have to get this
for him and I think it smells a little
bit like trouble he loved it by the way
he's like oh my god this smells so good
we have to get like more of these soaps
and I'm like yeah well these are like
very pricey and this one was on sale for
15 or normally like twenty dollars a
piece and I'm like I'll take my bath and
body works like deep cleansing hand
soaps but anyway it smells really really
good it's a very woodsy and kind of
manly scent so I was not surprised that
he liked it I think it's really really
nice to have a nice little bottle it's
not glass it's plastic but he did really
like it and he was like why don't we
pick up a few candles from them and I
was like oh my gosh like do you want
like a candle in this set like that gets
me going because I'm normally the candle
hoarder out of the two of us he's kind
of sensitive to fragrance so it was like
a big deal that he was like I would like
to have like a candle like the scent in
my
my word life yes so anyway we really
really enjoyed this and I feel like we
will probably repurchase this then to
whether it be in like the diffuser form
or the soap for more the candle for my
think that this is a good one he really
really enjoys this and it smells really
good so anyway that is kind of my follow
up all on the items that i purchased
from Sephora last week like I said I
will have enough there's Sephora haul my
goodness i need to stop shopping so much
i will have another so for a hug coming
this coming week um yeah and that one
has quite a bit of stuff so this one was
kind of a smaller one there was only
what like six products this coming on i
think i was like maybe eight nine I
don't even know there's this there's a
lot of stuff it was basically one of
those like shopping things where you go
into your loves list and you just start
buying stuff so anyway I hope you guys
