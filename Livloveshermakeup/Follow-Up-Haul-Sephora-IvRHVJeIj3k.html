last week I did a call for you guys it
was this Sephora haul and I will link
that video down below if you would like
to see all the like unboxing and
swatches of everything but I am back to
give you guys kind of my first
impressions and my thoughts on the
products that I hauled it has been one
week exactly I'm gonna let you guys know
which products are working for me and
which ones aren't so the first two
things I had picked up over these little
glam glow masks in the dual cleanse form
and also the youth's mud form format
formula this is what they look like
these are little tiny ones that are 1.25
no point 5 ounces or 15 grams apiece I
really really love these these are all
two of my favorite master glam glow I
just wish that I hadn't gotten the tiny
little sizes just because I did dig into
this one this week and I was like okay I
literally used it twice and it's almost
gone so that's kind of annoying and I
just wish I had gone and just splurged
and bought this $69 mask in the
full-size because I think it really is
worth it so that's the only thing I'm
gonna say that was not so great about it
and I really disappointed myself because
I went and did more hauling from so far
you guys will see that haul in time this
week when I Drive time to post it but
yeah I did more damage and I have been
shopping regularly at Sephora every
single week I think I've been doing this
too for a haul every single week for
like the past 3 weeks I really need to
stop but anyway I did go and I picked up
another one of these little mini ones
that I was like why do you do that so I
picked up a little thirsty med one which
is the hydrating treatment which I also
really like a lot so that's my only
regret and I guess my regrets for the
next call as well is the fact that I
picked up the tiny little ones I should
just go ahead and splurge in the big
ones because I already know I love them
and you get like no use out of these so
the next two products I picked up or
supplements um you might feed me a
really really great feedback about this
I asked you guys if you would like to
see a whole video dedicated to some
nutrition products basically hummingbird
nutrition which is this brand that you
can get at Sephora um I was talking
about the skinny birdboy and I called
this and also the big Chelle skinny bird
is a supplement to that
I have been taking for a long time now
and you guys were really really
interested particularly in this
supplement but also you said you would
definitely like to see a video on all of
the supplements that I have from them I
think I have almost all of them except
for two and who knows by the time I make
the video it will be up in February but
this time I make the video maybe I'll
have all of them so I will give you guys
a nice overview of the brand and also
let you know like which are my favorite
ones but anyway I hold this one this is
skinny bird I take this two times a day
30 minutes before food it helps with my
sugar intake like it just helps cut down
on my sugar cravings basically it's got
5htp chromium in it it helps to control
your blood sugar it's just a really
really nice supplement I did warn you
guys if you have sensitive tummies to go
ahead and not take it on an empty
stomach I recommend taking it only
before luncheon before dinner if you
have a sensitive stomach because if you
take it in the morning before breakfast
you might be sick to your stomach but
you can take it up to three times a day
but anyway loving it I have a purpose
you have many many times and then the
other supplement that I had gotten was
the UM Big Chill so this is basically a
supplement that has role rhodiola
rhodiola
our h o di o la anyway it's supposed to
help like calm you down and things like
that you guys know I do suffer from ADHD
and sometimes I just feel like what's
the best way for me to describe my ADHD
it's like I have a television in my
brain with 20 different channels going
off at once so the noise is nice to just
um not constantly be thinking about 20
or 30 things at once and sometimes it
gives me anxiety I get a little bit of
anxiety I'm not someone who gets anxiety
over little small things or anything
like that I'm usually pretty good at
coping
however when like my ADHD symptoms are
on like full Drive and I just cannot
concentrate nice and literally thinking
about a bajillion things at once I do
get anxiety because I mean who wouldn't
so anyway I have been taking these for a
week I'm happy to let you guys know I
have felt good this week I mean I'm
still obviously hyper and whatnot but I
have felt a little more like at ease
just just a little more calm and
especially at night when my medications
start to wear off at night that
when I get really really hyper and I
have noticed I've been getting to bed at
a really decent hour all week and I've
just not felt so like like I'm gonna
burst I just haven't felt like I've know
that crawling up the wall or something
like that you know like my energy level
has been really really nice and
consistent and not to like fluctuating
sometimes I'm really really just I mean
my normal I got the whole thing about
ADHD now but normally I'm like this like
I am right now I have a good high energy
level but then sometimes it's spikes way
up and then I just can't concentrate I'm
all over the place and I've noticed that
I haven't had any of those issues this
week so that's what I was trying to say
I'm sorry I didn't mean to go into a
little rat there but anyway so I think
this has been helping me they say to
give it about two weeks so it could just
be a placebo effect that I'm
experiencing but I will keep you guys
updated on this one and of course I will
be talking about it when I do become
nutrition fail all right the next thing
I had picked up was this gorgeous steal
a palette look at that packaging can we
just like yes yes yes yes so this is the
eyes are the window shadow palette in
body and I did wear this one time this
week now when I put my fingers in here
the first thing I noticed is that
there's a lot of grit and just kind of
texture to these shadows which I I'm not
gonna say I don't like but I want to
like rub my finger in there and feel
really buttery things I feel like
everybody nowadays wants to feel that
like you just expect everything to be
super soft like a makeup geek shadow or
like a foil of eyeshadow or something
like that these are not like that but
the pigmentation is amazing and they
look really really nice on the eyes so
I'm willing to forgive the fact that yes
they're not super creamy and buttery
because I think that they really have
great pigmentation and I think that they
really show up beautifully on the eyes
and what I liked I only wore it one day
on my eyes but what I liked was that the
colors you could see the clear
difference
on my eyes so I wore that burgundy shade
and then this like slate gray shade and
you could see the difference they didn't
all just muddle together so that's what
I liked I did go ahead and doesn't make
this as my palette for this coming week
so this is the palette that I will be
playing with the whole week I will let
you guys know at the end of the week if
this was a fail or a Holy Grail you guys
will see that in my weekly favourites
video next Sunday and I'll let you know
if this was a really really like I said
a sailor a Holy Grail
so far it seems really really nice I am
just like a little iffy of the fact that
it's not super super creamy and because
I find that they're just not super super
blendable but at the same time they're
so pigmented and the colors are really
really different from each other you can
tell like okay I put that burgundy shade
on my lid or I put that slate gray color
underneath my lower lashline you can
really see the difference which I like
so right now I'm kind of like I'm not
quite sure I am going to play with it
more on my eyes and I will keep you guys
updated so yeah alright
and then the last product that I had
picked up it was this hand soap and we
have used quite a bit of this at least
that much in a week and we have this in
our master bathroom I got this from my
boyfriend basically he loves anything
truffle so this was the nest fragrances
woodland truffle liquid soap and I was
like I have to get this for him and I
think it smells a little bit like
trouble he loved it by the way he's like
oh my god this smells so good we have to
get like more of these soaps and I'm
like yeah well these are like very
pricey and this one was on sale for 15
they're normally like $20 a piece and
I'm like I'll take my bath and body or
it's like deep cleansing hand soaps but
anyway it smells really really good it's
a very woodsy and kind of manly scent so
I was not surprised that he liked it I
think it's really really nice it has a
nice little bottle it's not glass it's
plastic but he did really liked it and
he was like why don't we pick up a few
candles from them and I was like oh my
gosh like do you want like a candle in
this set like that gets me going because
I know
the candle hoarder out of the two of us
he's kind of sensitive to fragrance so
it was like a big deal that he was like
I would like to have like a candle like
the scent in my office and I was like
yes so anyway we really really enjoyed
this and I feel like we will probably
repurchase this then - whether it be in
like the diffuser form or the soap form
or the candle form I think that this is
a good one he really really enjoys this
and it smells really good so anybody
that is kind of my follow up all on the
items that I purchased from Sephora last
week like I said I will have enough
there Sephora oh my goodness I need to
stop shopping so much I won't have
another so for a hug coming in this
coming week yeah and that one has quite
a bit of stuff so this one was kind of a
smaller one there was only what like six
products that's coming on I think sounds
like it's maybe eight nine you know I
don't even know there's this there's a
lot of stuff it was basically one of
those like shopping things where you go
into your loves list and you just start
buying stuff so anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me and I'll see you guys
