tml thank you so much for joining me I
hope you are all having a fantastic day
I apologize that the lighting is a
little off again today as I'm filming
this in the morning it's about six a.m.
and it's still really dark and cloudy
out still we're having like bad storms
here so i apologize about the lighting
but i ain't here to give you guys a
quick little follow-up on the Sephora
haul that I did I believe it was exactly
a week ago from today so I'll link the
original video down below if you would
like to see kind of like my first
impressions and I'll just watch us on
the products but I have six products
here that I've picked up I don't talk
about the samples or they deluxe I
samples when I do these follow-up halls
just because I didn't really get into
them yet but I'm here to talk about all
of the products that I purchased in a
full size because they have gotten into
all those so let's just get started the
first item I want to talk about is the
only henriksen grease relief cleansing
cloths these are oil free pour refining
botanical a che and they have eucalyptus
in them I love love love these I will
definitely be the purchasing when I get
through these oh they smell so good they
are really really nice I've been using
them to kind of tone of my face in the
morning I've been really really greasy
so I'll wash my face and then go in with
these they have a textured side and then
a softer side they really just like
tighten your skin up and make it feel
really really nice and they definitely
remove the grease so I have been loving
these they said item I had picked up
with the glam glow super cleanse daily
clearing cleanser the obsession is so
real with this product you guys it is
absolutely amazing i love this it has a
really really nice big pump sorry if
it's a wet this is in my shower but i
use this at night time i love it i just
put it you can put it on dry skin that's
how they recommend using it i can use it
on wet skin too i just massage it in
leave it for a few seconds because it's
kind of like a mask too foaming cleanser
sort of thing it doesn't film up a lot
but it just feels so nice on the skin if
you have sensitive skin I would highly
recommend like staying away from this it
definitely has peppermint oil and also
licorice root extract in it so those are
actually kind of technically like skin
irritating ingredients but they don't
irritate my skin I feel like this really
clears the gunk out of my skin is been
keeping my skin relatively clear this
week and I really love this if you have
oily or combo skin I highly highly
recommend and you get so much product in
here like so much you get five ounces or
150 grams which is a lot so I am loving
this I'm definitely thinking about
getting the tingle exfoliate one and
also what is it the green one dual
cleanse so yeah I want to collect all of
these in a full size I think they are
amazing cleansers alright moving on the
next product that I had picked up with
the NARS velvet matte skin tint with
broad-spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen this is
what it looks like and the shape I
picked up was light 20 Terran way there
I'm loving this I've been wearing it all
week the only thing I don't like is that
the packaging is super sleek and Matt
but you get like little finger prints
and stuff all over it but again I feel
like that's typical Norris a kitchen by
the way I don't have a bun maker in
today so if my bun looks really weak
that's why Oh anyway I really really
love this product it's a really nice
shade match I like that it keeps me
relatively Matt throughout the day kind
of a nice like Demi Matt appearance to
the skin really really beautiful product
really nice like light to medium
buildable coverage so I am enjoying that
a lot and then I also picked up two more
of the two face I love flush 16-hour
blushes 16-hour yet long-lasting 16-hour
blushes and how deep is your love which
is a hot coral and then I will always
love you which is a soft peach love
these they're beautiful I'm collecting
all the shades the only one that I meet
now is baby love and I'm definitely
going to pick that up during these
sephora vib rouge sale or whatever and
let me know if you guys would like I
plan on doing a wishlist video for the
Sephora sale because I feel like we're
going to be getting our coupon any day
now because they did get my ulta coupon
let me know if you guys got yours too
but let me know if you would also like
me to do a recommendation video because
i'll be putting these babies in there
but yeah these are beautiful really been
enjoying those and then the last item i
had picked up was the origins by all
greens foaming deep cleansing mask with
green tea spirulina and spinach i did a
review and demo on this product i will
go ahead and link it down below if you
are interested along with the original
haul video but i love this a lot really
really nice on the skin if you have oily
skin or combination skin i highly
and it really just clears the gum out of
your skin stay away if you have
sensitive aging or dry skin but yeah
those are all of the products that I
picked up from Sephora this is my little
follow-up all really happy with
everything so far so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me and I'll see you my next one
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
