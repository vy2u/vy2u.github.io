thank you so much for joining me i hope
you are all having a really really
fantastic weekend or at least i hope
that your weekend was really fantastic i
am here to share a follow up all on some
of the target products that i had picked
up what was it a week and a half ago two
weeks ago I want to say it was two weeks
ago I did a target haul where I shop for
some makeup I did some skincare shopping
some hair care I just got a whole bunch
of different things and it's been
exactly well two weeks in one day since
I purchase all of them and I wanted to
come on here and share with you guys my
first impressions on the products or if
I like them or not I have already
completely used up a few of them so yeah
let's just get right into it shall we
I'm going to go in the order of what
people were asking about the most so
it's not going to be the exact order of
what I hauled them in i will link the
original video down below if you are
curious but i just thought you know I
don't know why I kept doing that where I
would follow it in the order of the
video because then it's like you're just
watching the hall over again so we're
gonna mix it up and start with the
products that people were asking the
most about so let's just get started the
first product that I had picked up or
the one that everybody was asking about
was the knee bath papaya nectar mini
bath ice creams there were six in here
and I only have one left I love these
you guys they are very comparable to
lush bath bombs in my opinion they're
not like a bubble bar they don't make
any bubbles in your bath they do make
you are they look like this by the way
they are individually wrapped which is
perfect for travel they don't make
bubbles in your bath and they don't
really color your bath like lush
products do but if you are sensitive to
like fragrances and things like that I
think you would actually really like
these these are not too overpowering
they do have a little bit of oil and
moisturizing properties in them however
they don't leave your bathtub feeling
completely greasy and grimy I didn't
feel like I had to clean out my bath
after using these and they're so cute
because they are a little mini ones so
it was 999 for a six-pack of these and I
think it's actually a really good deal
um they have different sort of sched
they have this one which was the papaya
nectar they have like lavender they have
a pomegranate one which is the one I'm
going to pick up next but yes I do think
they are somewhat comparable to lush
bath bombs so if you really like
products from lush you should definitely
check out those me back mini bath ice
cream
I really really enjoy these and that is
that they were perfect for travel
because they are individually wrapped so
you can just pop them in your bag and go
alright the next thing I'm going to talk
about is the pixie skin treats glow
tonic exfoliating toner i have used
about half of this now which totally
sucks because this is so expensive this
is like a fifteen-dollar toner and you
only get 3.4 fluid ounces in here it has
five percent glycolic acid in it with
aloe vera and ginseng so it really
brightens and lifts your skin I use it
in the morning and at night I've been
using it all week it you will see it in
my fails and holy grill later today it's
just a wonderful product I really really
enjoy it i'm happy i picked it up but i
do not know if I would repurchase
because it is so darn expensive for a
toner but this has been treating my skin
very nicely alright the next product
that was also skincare related that I
picked up was the Neutrogena oil-free
acne stress control power cream wash
this has a micro clear technology in it
with 2% salicylic acid I really enjoy
this a lot for my combination skin I
feel like the creamy texture of it
doesn't dry out my cheeks but it
definitely takes care of oil in my
t-zone so this is definitely a winner
winner chicken dinner alright moving on
another product that I picked up that
I'm really loving is the Maybelline brow
drama cran pomade I got the lightest
shade which I believe is called blonde
it doesn't have the name on here but
this is what it looks like it is
basically just a pomade cran in pencil
form and you just paint it onto your
eyebrows it has a very very slick
texture so it does move around a little
bit you might want to set it in with a
powder if you feel like you're like
eyebrow area or in that area you know
you get a little greasy I sometimes do
because I've combination skin so I get
oily in my t-zone my eyebrow start to
get a little oily so I do like to set
this in with a like another brow product
i've been using the benefit gimme brow
this week to kind of set this in but
it's wonderful i like it right in the
front of my eyebrows it goes on really
really easily a little goes a long way
so be careful with this one my friend
Darlene here on youtube or she's one of
my subscribers who I I love she
recommended really use like a nice light
hand with that product and honestly
definitely do that because if you go too
hard with it or you push it down too
much there will be product all over your
eyebrows so I do really like that
the next product I picked up that I'm
really not that keen or fond of is the
aveeno active naturals clear complexion
daily cleansing pads these are salicylic
acid blemish treatment pads with 0.5
percent salicylic acid my skin has been
doing very well with salicylic acid
lately which is why I picked up so many
products the salicylic acid but i don't
really like these i thought they would
be sort of comparable to the rock daily
resurfacing discs which is something
that i use as the second part of my
nighttime cleansing routine after i take
my makeup off so these are very similar
they are just little pads like this one
side is textured for exfoliating and the
other side is completely soft for
cleansing they do have a lovely lovely
sent to them if you have sensitive skin
you probably would actually be I don't
think you would like the scent I think
it would actually like irritate your
skin more than help it but I feel like
point 5 cells so like a point five
percent thought cell is the l'académie
that I cannot think point five percent
salicylic acid really doesn't do that
much for pimples as far as I'm concerned
again I kind of just use them to remove
my makeup and they're just not the same
as the rock one they're just not they
are cheaper but the rock ones just have
something in them that this one doesn't
now the rock ones don't have cell acetic
acid in them they just have some sort of
like anti-aging ingredients but it's way
better they remove makeup a lot better
and yeah I probably would not be
purchased these abena once alright
moving on something that I loved and
that I'm just a crazy about is the suave
professionals coconut milk infusion deep
moisture mask my hair loves this ok
literally just loved it i mean i have
tons of texture spray in today and i
braided my hair and i still think that
it looks nice and soft and manageable
and if my hair just love this it's like
three or four dollars at Target it
smells amazing like coconuts and it's
just so darn good it does not weigh down
my fine hair I don't put it on my roots
they only put it on my ends but if you
want a really really good moisturizing a
deep conditioner that's not going to so
much repair your hair but just put
moisture in definitely check out this
suave professionals one alright moving
on i also picked up a Pantene moisture
miss detangler i'm loving this I really
deal with a lot of tangle
in my hair all the freaking time all the
time all the time my hair tangles up all
the time so I've been really enjoying
this a lot you can use it on dry hair
you can use it on wet hair and I believe
this was only 399 or 499 I do like this
better than my L'Oreal power moisture
detangler I don't really like that one
I'm trying to get through it because I
just don't think it's that great i feel
like this puts more moisture in than the
hydra detangler one from L'Oreal yep
alright the next product was a total
utter disappointment and it's crazy
these are the Sarah bay or cerave makeup
removing cleanser cloth cerave or sarah
b is a completely completely like
sensitive skin they're there look simple
okay they're like cetaphil or cetaphil
they're supposed to be very very gentle
on all sorts of skin types you guys
these burnt the hell out of my face I
could not believe it i have had great
luck with their moisturizing creams some
of their cleansers they have fantastic
products i just could not believe um
what happened to my skin with these it
was just ridiculous they did not remove
waterproof mascara it says they're ultra
gentle and the National eczema
Association endorsed them they burnt my
face not my eyes but my face so I didn't
use them up completely but no I would
not repurchase hell new alright another
product i used of completely was the
Neutrogena naturals purifying facial
cleanser i picked this up to cleanse my
makeup brushes did not like it for it
whatsoever i don't remember who
recommended this for cleaning your
brushes but it makes them weird it makes
the bristles all sticky and clump
together and you have to loosen them up
after they're dried and it has salicylic
acid in it which I feel like dries out
the bristles on your brushes so yeah I
would not repurchase this alright moving
on I did pick up this little Nick's
color correcting concealer this is a
little palette love this really really
enjoying this you guys can see I've
really dug into here a lot I would say
the mists in here is definitely the
contouring product but I really like the
purple one and the yellow one the most
and this peach color right here is
beautiful underneath the eyes they color
correct and also conceal at the same
time so that was definitely a good deal
all right and in the last two products
oh okay well one of them fell but this
is the open
premium cotton oval they already used up
one bag and then the other one is still
full I love those they're amazing for
you know putting on micellar water
taking off makeup putting on your toner
whatever you want and then i would
definitely repurchase and then these
suave professionals keratin infusion dry
shampoo i have purchased this before i
love it it doesn't leave your hair
textured it doesn't leave any color in
it I'm not wearing it today or night I
don't have it in my hair and not wearing
it I don't have it in my hair today i
have the dev one which does like a
little bit of white residue in your hair
but i like this one for when i'm wearing
my hair down and it just needs some lift
and volume without any sort of texture
or weird like grainy feeling in your
hair so yeah alright guys that was my
little follow-up all on the target
purchases that i got two weeks ago i
hope you guys enjoyed this and my failed
in halle trails will be up later tonight
