thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a wonderful day let
me just situate myself um yes there are
boxes everywhere my boyfriend I have
moved into a new bigger apartment we
actually only moved up 10 floors were in
the same building but it was a lot of
work it happened last weekend which is
why I ended up not being able to film a
what was it weekly favorites video for
you guys I knew I said that I was going
to and I'm so sorry I just never got the
chance we got our keys a day early um
last Friday so basically about a week
ago and we started moving our stuff up
it was a lot of work my boyfriend is a
doctor and he was on call for like two
of the days so a lot of it was just me
and my dad moving boxes up there was a
lot of stuff going on and yeah so please
excuse the boxes behind me we are new to
this apartment there's a lot going on I
want to tell you guys right away my
filming area situation will be changing
I now have a beauty room which is so
exciting so I have a room that is
dedicated to make up and also music so
music / beauty room so it will be you
know where I have my instruments where I
practice and also where I have all my
makeup stored I am ordering things or in
you know the process of ordering things
right now I'm likea like storage wise
things like that I'm definitely getting
the Alex drawers I think that those look
so beautiful and I know they're going to
store makeup perfectly so I am in the
process of doing that I'm obviously
filming in my dining room / kitchen area
today so um I you know I'm sorry for
that but um it's just gonna take
probably a couple weeks to get
everything completely together so I hope
you guys do understand anyway today's
video is going to be a follow-up hall if
you guys watched last week I did I have
a little list here of everything that I
want to do in order but I posted a video
on an alcohol it was an Ulta makeup haul
with swatches and it is about a week
later and i'm going to share with you
guys my thoughts on the products that i
purchased so let's just get started i
will link the video below in the
description bar if you don't know what
video i'm talking about but anyway let's
just get started I have a little list
here like I said I tried to write down
everything in order of how
Oded on the other video so i am just
going to go through it like that so the
first two things that i had picked up
with these l'oreal paris True Match Lumi
powder glow illuminator blush blushes
and highlights they look like this and
the shades I got were c30 to ice and
also um n20 two rows and the first one I
talked about was ice and it looks like
this and I really actually do not like
this this is a very very blue toned
purple toned and I find that it's just
too harsh on my skin tone which is crazy
because I'm quite there so you can
imagine how harsh it must be on a lot of
other people's skin tone unless you are
literally the color of like a wall I'm
like literally super super super fair
this is just not going to look very
flattering it really has this purpley
bluish undertone and it's just not very
attractive on the skin I find when I put
my brush in here no matter what i'm
using it kicks off a lot of products a
lot of powder I don't like that and I'm
just not into this I will of course use
it because i like to use um any kind of
makeup products that i don't like I
still try and use them and incorporate
them into like my makeup routine um so
yes I will try and use that one but I do
not like it and now the gross one on the
other hand I actually do like I am
wearing it today it is what is giving me
that glow on my cheekbones I think that
this is a lot more like neutral it's got
some pinky shades and there are some
peachy undertones and it is just a lot
better for the majority of skin tones in
my opinion so I really really do like
this one it doesn't kick up nearly as
much powder or product as the other one
which is weird so I don't know really
what the deal is with that but I
definitely like the Rosalyn not so much
the ice one I just want to say right
away at my nails are horrendous I have
not been putting any nail polish or
anything on them the past couple days
because I did sliced open my fingers the
other day opening boxes on a pair of
dirty scissors gross horrible of course
my boyfriend who's a doctor freaked out
he was like oh my god you know there's
blood everywhere it was really
disgusting i'm sorry i just wanted to
say that so you guys could understand
why my nails look so horrendous but i
haven't been able to like wash my hands
properly or like paint my nails do any
of that kind of stuff that
I really really like so um yeah please
excuse that little gouge doubt finger
right there it's even been hard for me
to practice my flute which is crazy
because I have to practice anyway moving
on the second thing is that i'm going to
talk about if a concealer and foundation
from maybelline i have showed these in
the hall um these hold on a second OOP
sorry guys I don't know what the deal is
like we've had really cold weather than
for the warm weather and left my nose
just gets running all the time I'm
starting to think like I don't actually
have allergies i'm starting to think
that I'm actually like allergic to make
up because every time I'm wearing it I
get a running out the phones horrible
but that won't mean anything I'm still
going to wear it but anyway the next two
things I talked about where this
concealer and foundation from Maybelline
these are the super-state better skin
concealer and then the foundation the
concealer shade i have is in 10 which is
ivory love this i'm wearing it today I
love applying it with a damp Beauty
Blender it is beautiful at covering like
dark circles brightening up the under
eye area it's just amazing i absolutely
love it highly highly recommend checking
out this concealer and the foundation i
absolutely love also i love applying it
with my fingers which is what i did
today I love applying it with a damp
Beauty Blender and also it is our just
dance fun do you guys know I like my
real techniques as well um but it is
also beautiful with like a buffing brush
and the elf what is it called the elf
ultimate buffing brush beautiful applies
this really really beautifully as well
you guys may be able to see it is a tad
dark um and I was worried about this
this is in the shade 15 ivory I don't
know why the concealer says 10 ivory
this one says 15 this is the lightest
shade they have any guys can see it is a
little pink toned on me I find that
vaguely products tend to do that
especially when they are powders um
anything that has to do really with like
foundation like any kind of liquid
product I see that they tend to do that
so um ooh sorry guys I do apologize
about the lighting just hang in there
and tell um you know I get all of my
ladies set up in the beauty room but
anyway
this has a little bit of like a pink
undertone a little orange e and you can
kind of tell it's not completely
noticeable but it you can kind of tell i
love the formula the formula is
beautiful if you do have dry patches you
really want to make sure that you
moisturize properly before applying this
because it does kind of cling to dry
areas but it was gorgeous it has a
gorgeous finish it's kind of like a
powdery like a powdery smooth sort of
finish it's beautiful you don't need a
lot of powder with this I absolutely
love the formula so very very happy with
the concealer and the foundation the
next thing I'm going to talk about is
the bare minerals color compatibles this
is an eye and cheek set i am wearing it
today i'm in love with this i'm so happy
that i picked up all these things that i
really really love so I wearing the
peachy blush down here today i'm wearing
the highlight on the inner corner of my
eyes I'm not wearing this dark bronzer
shade but these eyeshadows are amazing
they are so blendable they are gorgeous
I am wearing hoopla today which is that
golden color I'm wearing that on my lid
and then I have that kind of dark
reddish ambery sort of color in my
crease and that is called bragging
rights sugar and priceless go
beautifully together you can just have
one on your lid have the other increase
and you are good to go beautiful
beautiful colors and the texture and
formula is fantastic and this blush down
here I absolutely love and have that on
the apples of my cheeks today it is
gorgeous it's so so impressed with this
palette the only thing I'm not impressed
with is the little dual ended brush it
is quite um like harsh feeling it feels
a little crispy on the skin I don't like
that but overall the formula of the you
know how to product amazing absolutely
adore um yeah I'm so happy like I really
really felt like I did good with that
Hall because it wasn't ulta.com fall so
it was online but I am so happy that I
consistently like a lot of these
products the next thing I'm going to
talk about is the little smash box set
that I have gotten um and I'm just going
to walk through all the products that
were in there and let you guys know what
I think the first thing that was in
there with the photo finish foundation
primer in light this is beautiful it
really kind of leaves a bit of like a
silicone e texture on the skin but not
too much a kind of
goes down to almost like a powdery feel
if that makes sense I really really like
it it's beautiful it does help with
pores it helps with oil control it's
very very nice and it does make your
makeup lasts a lot longer than it
normally would the other thing that was
in the set was the photo fish photo
finish hydrating under eye primer this
is nice it has a little bit of a pink
like undertone up in queue and the
thought like contact is that it kind of
helps fill in like a fine lines it also
gives like extra moisture but you know
what I really don't find that this is
absolutely necessary i'm wearing it
today I just feel like it's an extra
step and honestly I can get the same
kind of thing by just applying an under
eye cream like a little like a second
layer of like an eye cream or something
like that so I absolutely do not think
that this photo finish I'm hydrating
under eye primer is necessary but um it
is the nice thing to have if you are a
total beauty lover and you're going out
and you know you're going to be out like
on the town or something and you want
your makeup to be absolutely like
impeccable this is definitely something
that can help it really does make sure
that concealers kind of stay on they
don't go like crazy throughout the day
they don't and like a break down
underneath your eye if that makes sense
but I don't seem to have a huge amount
of issues with that I think that like I
said you can just add an extra layer of
your eye cream and you should get the
same kind of result if that makes sense
so definitely not necessary but it is
nice to have another product that was in
there was this Smashbox few should soft
like baked starburst this is gorgeous
it's like a highlight bronzer is sort of
color wheel basically it works the
bronzer on my skin tone and also works
as a night light I would say it probably
would work mostly as a highlight on most
skin tones if you're a medium to deep
definitely just a high life but for me
it does work as a bronzer I absolutely
love it i think it's gorgeous it just
has all these shimmery shimmery gorgeous
like gold tones and deeper tones and
like pinky peachy tones this was the
reason i got the kid i really wanted
this separately so that is why i got the
whole whole kit because this basically
paid for the kids
um but oh my god I just been that was
sorry um but yeah I really really love
this I think it's awesome I'm very very
happy with this beautiful beautiful kind
of glowy um you know highlight or color
to your skin that will give it to you
the next thing that was in the kids with
this Smashbox I'll be sharp waterproof
kohl liner and this is in the shade
sumatra i am wearing it in my waterline
today i absolutely love it it wears
beautifully in the water line it has
this nice little like twist off cap and
you can just twist up the product like
that it is a deep deep matte charcoal
charcoal but um deep deep like espresso
color it is super dark it really really
like makes the eye look very dramatic
and precise I absolutely love it like i
said it wears beautifully in the water
line and it is a cold pencil so it's
kind of like easy to smudge underneath
the water line as well if you kind of
just want to underneath the lower lash
line or on your upper and you know your
upper lash line it is just gorgeous I'm
absolutely love so absolutely absolutely
love that product and then the last
thing that was in that little set with
this Smashbox to lip gloss in core line
it's just a pretty kind of neutrally um
like Corley kind of dirty quarreling
color if that makes sense it's not
bright coral it's kind of like muted
Horrell it does have a nice little
applicator um this is not a product that
i would pick up separately i would not
get a full-size with this however i
really do think that it stays on nicely
it is a little tacky i think that's the
only reason that it stays on as long as
it does because it does have a little
bit of tech eNOS and stickiness to it
but it's not my favorite shade i think
it does kind of make like the lips look
a little more neutral so if you are into
kind of nude lips or just not like a
super bright lip this is a nice color to
talk any kind of lipstick or whatever
but overall not really my favorite shade
but of course i can use it and then
let's see here with last time here oh
the Urban Decay lippy so yes I picked up
one of these urban decay um
supersaturated high-gloss lip colors
these were on sale for like ten dollars
a piece I really need to go back
to the Ulta website or support website
if they still have these and take up the
other ones cuz they absolutely love the
formula the shade I got within love
child and you guys can see it really
helped kind of use this it's very warm
down at this point but it's this
beautiful kind of neutrally pink color
it's almost eight my lips the better
sort of shade and and it is what I'm
wearing today um so yeah it is really
really beautiful and I had been wearing
before I just applied this again I've
been wearing it for a few hours and it
does kind of I don't know it doesn't
last very long on the lips but it is
really pretty if easy to reapply it
doesn't get stuck on your teeth it's a
beautiful beautiful neutral color and I
really really love it it goes on a
little glossy and then the glossiness
start to kind of subside and you are
left with just a really really nice
pretty color that does kind of go evenly
on the lips if that makes sense so it
does not have like the longest where
power or time but it does mean no sense
it's not super long wearing but it is it
does like wear evenly that makes sense
so yes it doesn't stay on forever but it
does wear off evenly and I do like that
so I love these definitely going to go
see when you pick up some more and yeah
so that was my follow-up hall on my
ultimaker paulo i hope you guys enjoyed
