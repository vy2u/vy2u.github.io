thank you so much for joining me I hope
you guys are having a wonderful day
let me just situate myself um yes there
are boxes everywhere my boyfriend I have
moved into a new bigger apartment we
actually only moved up ten floors we're
in the same building but it was a lot of
work it happened last weekend which is
why I ended up not being able to film a
what was it weekly favorites video for
you guys I know I said that I was going
to and I'm so sorry I just never got the
chance we got our keys a day early um
last Friday so basically about a week
ago and we started moving our stuff up
it was a lot of work my boyfriend is a
doctor and he was on called for like two
of the days so a lot of it was just me
and my dad moving boxes up there was a
lot of stuff going on and yeah so please
excuse the boxes behind me we are new to
this apartment there's a lot going on I
want to tell you guys right away my
filming area situation will be changing
I now have a beauty room which is so
exciting so I have a room that is
dedicated to makeup and also music so
music / Beauty room so it will be you
know where I have my instruments where I
practice and also where I have all my
makeup stored I am ordering things or in
you know the process of ordering things
right now I'm like eeeh
like storage wise things like that I'm
definitely getting the alux drawers I
think that those look so beautiful and I
know they're gonna store makeup
perfectly so I am in the process of
doing that
I'm obviously filming in my dining room
/ kitchen area today so um I you know
I'm sorry for that but um it's just
gonna take probably a couple weeks to
get everything completely together so I
hope you guys do understand um anyway
today's video is going to be a follow-up
haul if you guys watched last week I did
I have a little list here of everything
that I want to do in order
um but I posted a video on an Ulta haul
it was an Ulta makeup haul with swatches
and uh it is about a week later and I'm
going to share with you guys my thoughts
on the products that I purchased so
let's just get started
I will link the video below in the
description bar if you don't know what
video I'm talking about but anyway let's
just get started I have a little list
here like I said I tried to write down
everything in order of how
on the other video so I am just going to
go through it like that so the first two
things that I had picked up with these
L'Oreal Paris true Match Lumi powder
glow illuminator blushed blushes and
highlights they look like this and the
shades I got were c30 - ice and also um
n20 - rose and the first one I talked
about was ice and it looks like this and
I really actually do not like this um
this is a very very blue toned purple
toned and I find that it's just too
harsh on my skin tone which is crazy
because I'm quite there so you can
imagine how harsh it must be on a lot of
other people's skin tone um unless you
are literally the colour of like a wall
I'm like literally super super super
fair this is just not going to look very
flattering it really has this purpley
blueish undertone and it's just not very
attractive on the skin I find when I put
my brush in here no matter what I'm
using it kicks off a lot of products a
lot of powder I don't like that and I'm
just not into this I will of course use
it because I like to use um any kind of
makeup products that I don't like I
still try and use them and incorporate
them into like my makeup routine um so
yes I will try and use that one but I do
not like it
and now the gross one on the other hand
I actually do like I am wearing it today
it is what it's giving me that glow on
my cheek bones I think that this is a
lot more like neutral it's got some
pinky shades and there are some peachy
undertones and it is just a lot better
for the majority of skin tones in my
opinion so I really really do like this
one it doesn't kick up nearly as much
powder or product as the other one which
is weird so I don't know really what the
deal is with that but I definitely like
the Rosalyn not so much the ice one I
just want to say right away my nails are
horrendous I have not been putting any
nail polish or anything on them the past
couple days because I did slice open my
fingers the other day opening boxes on a
pair of dirty scissors gross horrible of
course my boyfriend who's a doctor
freaked out he was like oh my god you
know there's blood everywhere it's
really disgusting I'm sorry I just
wanted to say that so you guys could
understand why my nails look so
horrendous but I haven't been able to
like wash my hands properly or like
paint my nails do any of that kind of
stuff
I really really like so um yeah please
excuse that little gouged out finger
right there it's even been hard for me
to practice my flute which is crazy
because practice anyway moving on the
second thing that I'm going to talk
about is a concealer and foundation from
Maybelline I have showed these in the
hall um these hold on a second oh sorry
guys I don't know what the deal is like
we've had really cold weather than for
the warm weather and left my nose just
gets ready all the time I'm starting to
think like I don't actually have
allergies I'm starting to think that I'm
actually like allergic to makeup because
every time I'm wearing it I get a runny
nose that sounds horrible but that
wouldn't mean anything I'm still gonna
wear it anyway the next two things I had
talked about where this concealer and
foundation from Maybelline these are
these superstay better skin concealer
and then the foundation that the
concealer shade I have is in 10 which is
ivory love this I'm wearing it today
I love applying it with a damp Beauty
Blender it is beautiful at covering like
dark circles brightening up the under
eye area it's just amazing I absolutely
love it highly highly recommend checking
out this concealer and the foundation I
absolutely love also I love applying it
with my fingers which is what I did
today I love applying it with a Beauty
Blender and also it is are just a damp
sponge can you guys know I like my Real
Techniques as well um but it is also
beautiful with like a buffing brush the
elf what is it called the elf ultimate
buffing brush beautiful apply this
really really beautifully as well you
guys may be able to see it is a tad dark
um and I was worried about this this is
in the shade 15 ivory I don't know why
you can see all her says ten ivory and
this one says 15 this is the lightest
shade they have and you guys can see it
is a little pink toned on me I find that
Maybelline products tend to do that
especially when they are powders um
anything that has to do really with like
foundation like any kind of liquid
product I see that they tend to do that
so um ooh sorry guys I do apologize
about the lighting just hang in there
and tell you know I get all of my ladies
set up in the Beauty room but anyway my
guys
this has a little bit of like a pink
undertone a little orangie and you can
kind of tell it's not completely
noticeable but anything you can kind of
tell I love the formula the formula is
beautiful if you do have dry patches you
really want to make sure that you
moisturize properly before applying this
because it does kind of cling to dry
areas but it is gorgeous it has a
gorgeous finish it's kind of like a
powdery like a powdery smooth sort of
finish it's beautiful you don't need a
lot of powder with this I absolutely
love the formula so very very happy with
the concealer and the foundation the
next thing I'm going to talk about is
the bare minerals color compatibles this
is an eye and cheek set I am wearing it
today I'm in love with this I'm so happy
that I picked up all these things that I
really really love so I'm wearing the
peachy blush down here today I'm wearing
the highlight on the inner corner of my
eyes I'm not wearing this dark bronzer
shade but these eye shadows are amazing
they are so blendable they are gorgeous
I am wearing hoopla today which is that
golden color I'm wearing that on my lid
and then I have that kind of dark
reddish ambery sort of color in my
crease and that is called bragging
rights sugar and price lists go
beautifully together you can just pop
one on your lid pop the other increase
and you are good to go beautiful
beautiful colors and the texture and
formula is fantastic and this blush down
here I absolutely love I have that on
the apples of my cheeks today it is
gorgeous
it's so so impressed with this palette
the only thing I'm not impressed with is
the little dual ended brush it is quite
like harsh feeling it feels a little
crispy on the skin I don't like that but
overall the formula of the you know
powder product amazing absolutely adore
yeah I'm so happy like I really really
felt like I did good with that haul
because it wasn't ulta.com fall so it
was on line but I am so happy that I
consistently liked a lot of these
products the next thing I'm going to
talk about is the little Smashbox tip
that I have gotten um and I'm just kind
of walked through all the products that
were in there and let you guys know what
I think the first thing that was in
there was the photo finish foundation
primer in light this is beautiful it
really kind of leaves a bit of like a
silicon e texture on the skin but not
too much it kind of goes down to almost
the powdery seal if that makes sense I
really really like it it's beautiful it
does help with pores it helps with oil
control it's very very nice and it does
make your makeup last a lot longer than
it normally would the other thing that
within the sect was the photo fish photo
finish hydrating under eye primer this
is nice it has a little bit of a pink
like undertone a pink hue and the
thought like concept is that it kind of
helps fill in like fine lines it also
gives like extra moisture but you know
what I really don't find that this is
absolutely necessary I'm wearing it
today I just feel like it's an extra
step and honestly I can get the same
kind of thing by just a pine and
under-eye cream like a little like a
second layer of like an eye cream or
something like that so I absolutely do
not think that this photo finish I'm
hydrating under eye primer is necessary
but um it is a nice thing to have if you
are a total Beauty lover and you're
going out and you know you're going to
be out like on the town or something and
you want your makeup to be absolutely
like impeccable this is definitely
something that can help it really does
make sure that concealers kind of stay
on they don't go like crazy throughout
the day they don't um like a breakdown
underneath your eye if that makes sense
but I don't seem to have a huge amount
of issues with that I think that like I
said you can just add an extra layer of
your eye cream and you should get the
same kind of result if that makes sense
so definitely not necessary but it is
nice to have another product that was in
there was this Smashbox fusion soft
lights baked starburst this is gorgeous
it's like a highlight bronzer is sort of
color wheel basically it works the
bronzer on my skin tone it also works as
a night light I would say it probably
would work mostly as a highlight on most
skin tones if you are a medium to deep
definitely just a highlight but for me
it does work as the bronzer I absolutely
love it I think it's gorgeous it just
has all these shimmery shimmery gorgeous
like gold tones and deeper tones and
like pinky peachy tones this was the
reason I got the kit I really wanted
this separately so that is why I got the
whole whole kit because this basically
paid for the kit itself
but um but yeah I really really love
this I think it's awesome I'm very very
happy with this beautiful beautiful kind
of flowy um you know highlight or color
to your skin that will give it the next
thing that was in the kit was this
Smashbox
I always sharp waterproof kohl liner and
this is in the shade Sumatra I am
wearing it in my waterline today I
absolutely love it it wears beautifully
in the waterline it has this nice little
like twist off cap and you can just
twist up the product like that it is a
deep deep matte charcoal charcoal but um
deep deep like espresso color it is
super dark it really really like makes
the eye look very dramatic and precise I
absolutely love it like I said it wears
beautifully in the waterline and it is a
Kohl pencil so it's kind of like easy to
smudge underneath the waterline as well
if you kind of just want to underneath
the lower lash line or on your upper and
you know your upper lash line it is just
gorgeous
I'm absolutely loved so absolutely
absolutely loved that product and then
the last thing that was in that little
set with this Smashbox the lip gloss and
core line it's just a pretty kind of
neutral II um like Corley kind of dirty
Corley color if that makes sense it's
not bright coral it's kind of like muted
coral it does have a nice little
applicator um this is not a product that
I would pick up separately I would not
get a full side with this however I
really do think that it stays on nicely
it is a little tacky I think that's the
only reason that it stays on as long as
it does because it does have a little
bit of tackiness and stickiness to it um
but it's not my favorite shade I think
it does kind of make like the lips look
a little more neutral so if you are into
kind of nude lips or just not like a
super bright lip this is a nice color to
top any kind of lipstick or whatever but
overall not really my favorite shade but
of course I can use it and then let's
see here with last time here oh the
urban decay lippy so yes I picked up one
of these urban decay super saturated
high gloss lip colors these were on sale
for like ten dollars a piece I really
need to go back on
the alte website or support website if
they still have these and pick up the
other ones cuz they absolutely love the
formula the shade I got within love
child and you guys can see it really
have kind of use this it's very worn
down at this point but it's this
beautiful kind of neutrally pink color
it's almost eight my lips a better sort
of shade and and it is what I am writing
today um so yeah it is really really
beautiful and I have been wearing before
I just applied this again I've been
wearing it for a few hours and it does
kind of I don't know it doesn't last
very long on the lips but it is really
pretty it's easy to reapply it doesn't
get stuck on your teeth it's a beautiful
beautiful neutral color and I really
really love it it goes on a little
glossy and then the glossiness start to
kind of subside and you are left with
just a really really nice pretty color
that does kind of go evenly on the lips
if that makes sense so it does not have
like the longest wear power or time but
it does need no sense it's not super
long wearing but it is it does like
weird evenly that makes sense
so yes it doesn't stay on forever but it
does wear off evenly and I do like that
so I love these definitely gonna go see
me pick up some more and so that was my
follow up haul on my Ulta makeup haul I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I will
