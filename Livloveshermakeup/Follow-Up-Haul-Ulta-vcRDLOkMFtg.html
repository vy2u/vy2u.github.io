in this video I am giving you guys my
follow-up hall on the alcohol that I did
exactly a week ago on my channel I will
go ahead and link that video down below
in the description bar if you would like
to see swatches on all of these products
and yeah let's just get right into it
not let you guys know if I am enjoying
the products that I picked up or if I'm
not liking them so the first thing that
I had picked up was the eco tools makeup
brush shampoo it says this deeply
cleanses your makeup brushes it is
dermatologist tested hypoallergenic and
free of parabens and fatal eights this
is what it looks like you get a nice
amount of product in here six fluid
ounces it has a kind of unique
interesting smell I don't know if I love
it or hate it I kind of hate it I'm
leaning more towards I hated but this
cleans my makeup brushes so well you
guys and actually it cleans your beauty
sponges like your beauty blender or your
real technique sponges it cleans them
really well to me to give these a bath
after I do this video anyway this is a
really really good nice product and I
believe this was only six or seven
dollars so i will definitely be
repurchasing this when i run out alright
the next thing i had picked up with the
Real Techniques deep cleansing gel and
this was my favorite way to clean my
beauty sponges or SpongeBob's and I
really really like this but I honestly
think the eco tools one works better
this has a really really thin
consistency to it almost like water
whereas this one's really really thick
and I feel like I have to use a little
more of this product than that one to
clean my sponges so i don't think i will
be repurchasing this after i go through
it i did love this for cleaning all of
my sponges before but now I think the
eco tools one is better so yeah i don't
think i will actually repurchase this
one alright moving on i had picked up
two of the essence all about
match-fixing compact powders I love
these a lot I already knew I did because
these are repurchases and as you guys
can see I have already hit pan on this
one in a week so yeah really really love
those they're amazing and I believe
they're 349 in Alta which is a great
deal alright i also had picked up some
of the tree hut she sugar scrubs in the
new sense this one is the marula and
jasmine and the consistency or the
formula oh my god
open this the consistency and formula on
all of baseball on there finally got it
all right the consistency and Barb EULA
on all of these scrubs is the same but i
only have gotten into the Marilla and
Jasmine one you guys can see I have
definitely gotten into this product I
use this two times already this week
which I know I made its kind of overuse
you should only really exfoliate your
body once or twice a week I actually
think I've used this three times but
it's amazing i love it and this scent is
really really nice my favorite one out
of all three is definitely the lychee
and plum again I haven't tried the
Moroccan rose or the lychee and plum yet
just because I'm saving these ones for
kind of more like summertime because I
feel like they have a really really
sweet sense to them but i thought this
marula and jasmine one it was really
really nice and I had kind of a warm
sense that is bringing me into the
springtime so I like this one a lot and
the other two have the same exact
formula if you are looking for a scrub
that will um completely like exfoliate
your skin without overdoing it or
without it being too much of like a lame
sort of scrub you don't even like it
does me scrub enough I feel like this is
the perfect combination of that and I
also moisturizes your skin without
leaving you greasy and oily so love
those and then also the daily
resurfacing disc from rock this is a
repurchase I've been loving these I've
used these as my second step in my
makeup removal at nighttime they're
amazing they're just as these big like
cleansing discs and you can cut them in
half if for some reason you don't need
to use like the whole thing um they
really lather up and foam up really
nicely and I take it down my neck and
down my decollete to remove my makeup
and I feel like sometimes there's just
like a lot of the product left in the
pad if that makes sense so I will cut
them in half most of the time but
they're amazing love those and then I
had also picked up two blushes from j
cap beauty in these shades 103 coral
dumpling and 105 pumpkin this is what
they look like these are amazing i'm
really interested in looking into more
of the products from jacob beauty
because i heard that they're little
baked trios are amazing as well so this
one's coral dumpling this one's pumpkin
these are super buttery and pigmented
they do have a lot of fallout but
they're really really reasonably priced
I
they recommend looking into the jcat
beauty line I also picked up the
Palladium at blush in the shade toasted
apricot love this a lot I feel like they
changed the formula a little bit on
these palladia blushes there's not as
much fallout and kick up when I put my
brush in now and I think they've just
gotten better so yeah I really enjoyed
that as far as the eyeshadow singles
that I had picked up I got two of the
palladio crushed I shadows I am loving
these these are way better than the
Loreal infallible ones in my opinion I
know everybody is crazy over the Loreal
infallible ones but I feel like they
have a lot of fallout these do not they
go on like a foiled I shadow this shade
right here is called xenon and this one
right here is called Eclipse and they're
just beautiful I actually like the two
of these together eclipse in my crease
and xenon on my litter underneath my
lower lashline really pretty very very
creamy and buttery eclipse is a little
better of a formula for whatever reason
but they're still really really good and
then um the Catrice liquid metal I
shadows I'm not really loving these you
guys know I picked these up they have an
overspray over them like a really strong
overspray which I didn't like but I like
this shade right here called do you see
me as a liner underneath my lower
lashline and I don't really like this
one at all this is number 0 1 0 look me
in the ice it's just really really flaky
has a lot of fallout it's just not my
favorite so yeah those are all of the
products that I can call for you guys
last weekend I hope you enjoyed this
little follow-up all thank you for
joining me and i'll see you in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
