forever 21 haul for you guys I picked up
a few things that i am going to be
taking on my holiday trips um I live in
Manhattan but i am going to the midwest
for the holidays and um it is pretty
cold there right now it's like snowing
it's like 18 degrees so I thought I'd
pick up a few things for the flight and
also just warmer clothing items that I
can wear what I'm there so let me show
you what I got the first thing I picked
up was this really long big black scarf
it is very very warm and I thought it
would go really nicely with the jacket I
just picked up so um this was let's see
here fourteen dollars and eighty cents
and it's basically like poncho style
it's one of those that you can like
we're off onto your shoulders and then
you can really wrap around like a
bajillion times if you want to because
it's so long so really like that I think
that will be really nice and warm and
cozy the next thing I picked up was this
nice chunky ivory oatmeal colored
sweater I thought this was really really
adorable it looks very very comfy and
it's got some cute little designs on it
and I think it's just going to be very
very warm and nice to wear this was 22
dollars and eighty cents the next thing
I picked up was this cute little dress
um it's kind of ruched at the breast
line and it goes down to probably i
would say mid thigh and it's in this
nice just opaque navy blue color which
is interesting you know I feel like you
could really dress this up or it could
be more casual so I'm excited for that I
think this would be nice for holiday
parties and doing maybe a red lip or
something and you know like a high bun I
think that would be very pretty so
excited for that the next thing I got
were a pair of gloves these were twelve
dollars and ninety cents and they are so
cute I don't know if you can see that
but they have tiny little hearts on them
so I really got these because I thought
they looked very warm and they are and
they actually fit my hands very very
well I pretty small hands so I was happy
that these fit so well so very excited
for these I think they just are going to
be nice and warm and
I move all my fingers not like a mitten
where you can only move your thumb so
nice and I love that pattern adorable
and then I picked up one of these little
detangling brushes I was originally just
gonna throw this like in my makeup bag
just to have something to you know brush
my hair out if I was on the plane or
whatnot but i think i'm just going to
use this as my brush for when i'm there
so if the detangling brush that you have
the shorter bristles and the longer
bristles and it's just so compact and i
think that this actually will do for my
brush so happy to bring that a lot the
next thing i got was just a nail file I
needed one so that was like 90 cents and
then the last thing i got was this nice
what is this is like a massager that you
can kind of work out like the knots like
in your back or your arms and i'm going
to bring this on the plane this was only
three dollars and ninety cents but um
you know sometimes when you're on the
plane it's kind of like if you know it's
kind of stressful and especially during
the holidays it's nice to just kind of
relax when you're on the plane so i
thought that would be nice anyway that
what my quick little Holly hope you guys
enjoyed it if you did give this video a
thumbs up and I will see you in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
