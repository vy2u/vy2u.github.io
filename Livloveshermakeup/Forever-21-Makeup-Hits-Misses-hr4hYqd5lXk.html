have a whole bunch of makeup here behind
me and that's because I wanted to do a
hit and miss this video on forever 21
makeup forever 21 kind of started out as
this clothing brand
I love forever 21 I like the shirt I'm
wearing under here is from forever 21 I
buy a lot of clothes from there
absolutely love it but now they've
gotten into a lot more different kind of
things they have like hand creams that
come in cute little humps like this they
have foam hair curlers in the shapes
apart they just have like home decor
stop it like everything there now and
recently something that has come out in
the past like couple of years is makeup
and so I have tried out a few things and
there are definitely some hits and some
misses more hits than misses but I
wanted to share with you guys what I
think is worth purchasing at forever 21
when it comes to makeup so let's just
get started the first thing I recommend
purchasing and I put them all back in
this little thing so you guys can see
this is six dollars and ninety cents
these are makeup sponges and they just
come in a little case of three and I
just want to show you guys in reference
this is my Beauty Blender right here and
I just you know I used it a little while
ago so it's wet so it has expanded but I
wanted to show you guys but these are
basically the same concept they're just
tiny little sponges in different shapes
and they are actually really good I
would say that when I look for sponges I
never look for something that's going to
be like a dupe to the Beauty Blender
because I've never found a dupe to the
Beauty Blender but I like to use things
like this for under my eyes like they
really really you can use them dry and
go straight under or you can you know
use them wet and they're never gonna be
like a Beauty Blender the Beauty Blender
is really porous and it just like never
I don't know it's hard to explain its
pores in the way that it really like
puts the make on makeup on beautifully
but at the same time it doesn't suck up
the product sometimes these do but what
I like to use these for are to set
concealer underneath my
and I like the different shapes so that
is a hit for me I definitely think that
these are good and you know you get a
little 3-pack of them and you get this
cute little bag to put them in so I
definitely would say that is a kit the
next thing I want to talk about this a
hit is this cute little lipgloss that
comes in the little owl little owl
packaging it smells like watermelon and
it is really nice it's just like really
soft and it does give a little bit of a
pink tint and it just makes your lips
really nice and glossy and I really like
it so that is another hit for me by the
way I will put on the forever 21 like
links below so that you guys can go on
and order all this stuff they don't
actually have like names or colors on
them but you can just look under beauty
and you should be able to find all these
so that's definitely a hit also the next
hit is this lipstick again it doesn't
say the actual color but it comes in
this beautiful rose gold packaging like
this it looks a really high-end you get
the color on the bottom and it is just a
completely matte beautiful pink lipstick
and this is very very pigmented and it
is completely matte and it just glides
on really nicely I'm really really
impressed there's the color I think it's
really really gorgeous very true to
color and really really happy with that
so I highly recommend those lipsticks
I'm going to get a few more colors of
those I think because those were really
cheap the next thing that is a hit for
me is definitely the forever 21 cream
eyeshadows that's what they look like
and the color I have is in 401 shiitake
like shiitake mushroom and that is what
it looks like and these just glide on
beautifully they remind me of the color
tattoos but even creamier and they're
just gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous they
have gorgeous color a gorgeous
pigmentation they just work really
really well they're super super shimmery
and I really like them they don't crease
and yeah they're super beautiful
so that is shitake and those
the cream eyeshadows from forever21 I
think they also had like a chocolate
brown one and maybe like a lighter shade
they only have three when I purchased
that one so maybe they have some more
I'd be happy to pick up some more
because I really do like that formula
the next thing I have that is a hit is
the gel eyeliner this is in brown and it
looks like this it's just a very very
deep dark brown color and it's a very
very pigmented and it goes on
beautifully so it's just super super
creamy easy to blend out it's like just
it's matte it looks gorgeous you know
you can put it underneath the lash line
and or you know use it to bling out your
eyeliner on the top I really loved it
they had this dark chocolate brown color
and they also have a black one so
definitely a hit for me stays all day
really love that one another hit for me
is also in this like rose gold packaging
this kind of reminds me of the Too Faced
what are those those blushes that they
came up for Valentine's Day it's like
big and carry blush or something like
that I don't know this kind of might say
that but it looks like this and it's got
the cute little hearts which out the
blush and then you get this bronzer and
these are both very very pigmented and I
really like them so you get that
gorgeous blush and the bronzer is like
kind of almost like a champagne e color
and it's got shimmer in it so those are
the two colors right there but that
blush is so like like bright and coral
color like it's amazing so I really
really like that that is the blush and
highlighter it says but you know that's
dark enough to be a bronzer for me but
that's what it looks like highly
recommend that by the way this goes
beautifully with that lipstick they
really really matched well so I highly
recommend that I love those I especially
loved that blush part if they made just
a blush in that color I'd be very very
happy and the next hit are these ultra
pigmented lip colors shake them up a
little bit they tend to separate a
little bit but if you shake
they are fine so these are the colors I
got again they don't actually have the
colors on like the name on the back but
this really hot pink color looks like
this show you guys these are just
pigmented it's like crazy
that is the lip color isn't that crazy
it is a really really pigmented I think
these were under three dollars so that
is the pink one take that off before it
stains because they do kind of stain my
lips after they dry and then I got this
kind of light pink nudie one and that
one looks like this just like a nice
light nudey pink color that one looks
like that
so really really beautiful gorgeous so
worth the money they have tons of colors
I only picked up two because I wasn't
sure if they were gonna be good or not
but I'm really really highly impressed
with those so I would definitely pick up
more of those ultra pigmented lip colors
the next thing that is a hit is also a
lipstick or a lip product this is the
lipstick ran in natural this is the
color that's the packaging and you open
it up and it's just a lip crayon it
looks like that and it's beautiful it's
really really smooth it glides on nicely
and this color is just really like in
right now so really really like that
like the formula of that a lot very
beautiful next thing that is a total hit
for me is this love and beauty shadow
palette and it looks like this it's just
a bunch of neutrals comes with a little
brush by always throw those out but
really really gorgeous like a neutral
palette they're pigmented they're just
really really nice colors so I really
really liked that one let me show
got some swatches my hands being offs
watched up now but as you can see really
really shimmery gorgeous gorgeous colors
the pallets on there I'd like only like
you know like five dollars six dollars
seven so highly recommend looking up
this one because it's just those nice
basic neutrals and I actually ended up
buying a pallet from Holt look that
actually looks really similar to this
it's from pop beauty and this one
actually is better in my opinion so love
that the next one I highly recommend
picking up and is definitely a hit is
the 21 eyes shadow palette it's huge it
looks like this I love this these are
beautiful colors and they are very very
pigmented let me show you guys like
these blues and turquoise is like shut
up
look at that know what that's crazy you
guys see that that is beautiful oh my
gosh especially that one right there
gorgeous shade so really really
impressed with this palette of course
it's huge and chunky and big but love it
if you are looking for a pop of color
you can get it from there get this off
my hand all right the next one I want to
talk about it's also a palette and this
is the nude palette it's called that's
all it says it looks like this also kind
of big and bulky it comes with a little
eyeliner that I'm not a huge fan of but
whatever these are the shades you get so
really really close to the Naked 3 in
color as you can see I think they were
trying to kind of embody that color
scheme and again just really really nice
and pigmented they're soft they're easy
to blend I think they're pretty you know
they're kind of that dusty rose like
concept and I definitely like them so
that is definitely a hit
I'd recommend picking that one up
and now we're gonna get into the missus
I only have three so that's pretty good
for an actual like a brand that I've
tried quite a few products from I think
it's good that there's only three so let
me show you guys what they are the first
thing is this little blush right here
and this is in hot pink and it's already
like broken right there this is just not
pigmented and it falls right out like of
the pan but this is the color I thought
it was a gorgeous color and it already
like broke and whatnot but it's just not
pigmented I mean it's just not if you
can see it's almost like it's hard to
explain it's just so so so like chalky I
don't know it's not cute not cute on the
skin but I wouldn't recommend getting
that so hot pink blush you know not so
much now had it all uh-huh the next
thing that I'm not impressed with it's
this ultimate glitter palette it looks
like this and it looks so beautiful like
I want to love this because of how it
looks but it's just like divorce concept
ever so basically you get these like
glittery you think they're gonna be
almost like pigments all it is is just a
glue with an overcoat of sparkle on it
do you see that so underneath that is
just glue so if you guys can see up
close when you dip your finger in there
underneath it's just like see-through
because it's just like glue under there
so that pretty color that you get like
on the top doesn't last and then when
you swatch them they look pretty at
first but then it's like they don't even
go on evenly so that's that's a no-no
for me and this palette it just it
hasn't impressed me maybe I can find
some way to work with it at some point
if not me go give it to a friend or you
know I don't even know but yeah
definitely not impressed with this don't
recommend it but then again it was so
cheap
so I'm not like completely disappointed
and the last thing that is a mess is
this face glow palette it looks like
this I wanted to love this as I love the
concept of having a highlight a blush
and a contour right there um this is the
highlight it's a cream and it's just
like it's it's pretty it's like a golden
cream this is the bush which is also
kind of pretty it's not too bad like
these aren't horrible you're probably
thinking why do you hate these and
that's the contour well they just don't
stay well on the skin they don't have
any lasting power and the contour has
tons and tons of shimmer in it which you
know if you're gonna contour properly
you probably don't want something with
shimmer in it it would be good as a
bronzer but as a contour it just doesn't
work but overall even with a primer and
a makeup setting spray these just didn't
last on my skin so do not recommend this
little face goal palette but anyway um
those are all of the makeup products I
have tried from forever 21 I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I tried to give
you guys as much information and
different um like sections I guess of
makeup like lip products eye palettes
eyeliners eye shadows things like that
that you guys could see and yeah I hope
it was helpful and I'll see you guys in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
