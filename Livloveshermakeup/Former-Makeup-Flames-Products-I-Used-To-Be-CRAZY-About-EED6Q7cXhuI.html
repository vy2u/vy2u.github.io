my channel today's video is going to be
all about products I used to be
absolutely crazy about now this kind of
goes hand in hand with the video that I
filmed on Friday which was all about
sentimental products I'll go ahead and
throw that video up in the cards if you
would like to check it out but that
video was more about like products that
I literally have an emotion connected
with does that make sense so like when I
hold it I think of an actual emotion
these are more so products that I have
just like panned the out of like I
have panned multiple multiples of these
products and I just thought it would be
fun to kind of check in with you guys
let you know how the relationship is
going between the two of us do I still
love them do I not love them anymore
things like that so anyway let's go
ahead and jump right into it the first
item I have here it's the Kat Von D
locket tattoo foundation it has been
very hard for me to actually declutter
this because like I said it was
something that I used to love and used
to be absolutely crazy with but yeah I
have fallen out of love with this
product when I do at my next declutter
with foundations I will be letting go of
this now the shade I have here is light
4004 this is too dark for me I do have
to mix it together with light 42 I have
three of these sitting in my collection
currently and the reason why I just
can't use this anymore is because it no
longer looks pretty on my skin I used to
be so oily in college that I could apply
one pump of this with my fingertips
which is crazy this is a very very thick
and hard foundation to blend so the fact
that I could actually blend it in with
my fingertips is like insane um but yeah
this used to look really great on my
oily skin I not only had a discoloration
I needed to cover when I was in high
school and when I was in college I also
had a texture and this is just something
that is fantastic for doing that but I
no longer have that much texture on my
face I'm more so just have discoloration
from lupus and things like that so this
is unfortunately a product I have fallen
out of love with and I just can't make
it look nice on my skin anymore so yeah
that is something that I no longer like
alright so the next item I have here is
the Maybelline master drama by eye
studio midnight master eyeliner this
thing is still a really really good
quality in my opinion I won't repurchase
because Maybelline does test on animals
but you guys can see it's a beautiful
beautiful creamy black eyeliner I feel
like this is very comparable to the it
cosmetics note of waterproof eyeliner in
the shade black which is actually go
figure what I have on my eyes too
it is super creamy and incredibly
incredibly long wearing so this is
something that I used to use when I was
in college and I still really really do
enjoy it all right next we do have the
hourglass ambient lighting powder in the
shade ethereal light this is something
that I have pantai think about five
times and this was what I'm used to
where as an actual high light back in
the day in college before the whole like
you know really wham bam in your face
kind of highlight trend was in so this
is absolutely gorgeous really really
nice if you do have a fair complexion
with a cool undertone I would say that
this is the ambient lighting powder that
is like the least talked about you know
dim light is one of those that everybody
likes and uses dim light is too dark on
me even when I am self-tans like
currently so I really enjoy using this
like I said I used to use it as an
actual highlight and no longer used it
as a highlight day I actually like to
use it to set to my under eye and also
just go ahead and buff it all over my
face as an actual finishing powder
I definitely don't reach for it as often
as I used to but I'm still pretty much
in love with it so yeah that is the
hourglass ambient lighting powder in the
shade ethereal light next we have
another foundation that I have totally
fallen out of love with this was again
something I've used in college it is the
Revlon Colorstay whipped creme and
makeup in the shade one and ten ivory so
it is something that just opens up it's
a really really nice container I
actually really like this packaging I
know a lot of people were like it's so
heavy and clunky and it's gross you have
to dip your fingers in it but this was
just a really really luxurious product
for me in college I didn't have the kind
of money to go and buy a bunch of stuff
in college it wasn't working at the time
so I did not have like you know the
funds to go and buy a ton a ton a ton of
high-end makeup like I do now but I
still think that this was something that
was amazing for me that's a really good
color match the shade ivory in the
Revlon line is actually quite light and
I like it because it doesn't go too pink
toned or too warm toned it's right in
the middle but unfortunately this just
looks so horrible on my skin now like
this is something I have to declutter my
next declutter because honestly although
it used to sit beautifully on my skin
nowadays like I have to mix this with an
oil I have to apply it with a damp
sponge and no longer is pretty on my
face so I think it would be great if you
do have really oily skin but for me now
you know I do still have a very oily
t-zone but the rest of my face is pretty
normal or dry it just no longer looks
good so yeah that is a product that I've
also fallen out of love with
next we have been mary-lou manizer do
you guys remember when this was like the
only highlight that people would wear I
got this I feel like my junior year of
college or something like that when it
did kind of this the trend of starting
to wear more highlighter on the face
started to come in so I've actually gone
through I think three of these I did
have one of them that shattered and
broke which is totally totally shitty
but that is what it looks like I would
describe it as a soft gold it is still
really really beautiful but I don't feel
like it competes with any of the
highlights that are coming out nowadays
you know what I mean so back in the day
it definitely was one of those products
where it gave me a very very strong
beautiful highlight day I also would use
it and double as an eyeshadow um but
nowadays I just feel like it really
can't compete with others that are out
there so I'm not necessarily like I
haven't fallen out of love with it I
just don't reach for it as much and I
don't know maybe I will declutter we'll
see next we do have a foundation that I
am still in love with it is the
covergirl outlast stay fabulous 3 in 1
foundation the shade that I have is 805
ivory this is a great color match if you
do have very very fair skin I did try
out the luminous version of this I ended
up up right I ended up decluttering it I
didn't like it as much but this has
great coverage really really good shade
selection and in my opinion it looks
really really nice on the skin so I
would say that this is more like a demi
matte appearance on the skin or finish
so it does work for my combo skin now
and it worked back in the day for me and
when I had really really oily skin and
yeah I still really really enjoy it
alright next we do have the wet and wild
color icon bronzer in the shade
reserve your cabana now this is more
technically like of a highlight I would
say I have gone through I think three
full sizes of this and I used to use
this again as an actual highlight before
the whole like really really went BAM in
your face highlight trend began so I do
not use it for that anymore I actually
go ahead and set my under eye with this
or again kind of use it like I use the
hourglass ambient lighting powder in the
shade ethereal light and I will use it
as a finishing powder but still
something that is absolutely beautiful
you get so much product in here really
nice if you are fair complected and I
still really enjoy that and then finally
we have the NYC smooth skin bronzer I
think I've panned oh I don't even know
six seven probably six or seven of these
since high school this is what it looks
like I first bought it because of Emily
Noelle 83 here on YouTube she was raving
about it back in the day
it still is a very very nice bronzer I
heard they can change up the packaging
and the color but for me I'm being fair
complected this is something that still
really works for me I do have to use a
very very fluffy brush it's not my
favorite favorite bronzer anymore
obviously back in the day they didn't
have the Physicians Formula murmur or
butter bronzers or like the laura geller
baked um what is that cushion one that I
kind of like but yeah this is something
that is still quite good is it something
that will stay in my collection for the
rest of my life probably not but it is
pretty darn good and I haven't
completely fallen out of love with it so
anyway guys those are at the products
that I used to be absolutely crazy about
those are kind of my updated feelings on
them let me know down below about
products that you see you used to be
crazy about let me know if you still
like them or if you foe and out of love
with them how you feel about them now
