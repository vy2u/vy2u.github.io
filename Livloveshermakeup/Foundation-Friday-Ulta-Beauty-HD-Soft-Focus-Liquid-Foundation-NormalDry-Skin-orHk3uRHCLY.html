blending right into the wall right now
without my makeup on I've been getting
so many complaints about this wall
behind me um you guys like I'm working
on a background currently it's just
right now with work and all that kind of
stuff I haven't had like a whole entire
day off to simply just work out my
background so I'm sorry I will be coming
soon I have some shelving units that
will be going behind me or cute little
shelves and then also I have some cute
little decor designs that will be up and
very very soon but anyway today I am
doing a foundation Friday video these
were inspired by the Taylor here on
YouTube I will link her channel down
below I love watching her first
impressions especially her foundation
first impressions and I used to do these
quite a lot when I had more combo oily
skin but I definitely got away from them
now that I have more normal dry skin I
just thought it wouldn't be as
interesting or intriguing because I'm
not necessarily looking for foundations
that cover a ton I'm looking for
foundations that look pretty on the skin
when you do have more normal dry skin
you're just looking for something that
will adhere to the skin in like a nice
smooth way I'm breaking out a little bit
currently and when I soon you guys in
when we start applying this product
you'll see what I'm talking about I
recently started another retinol oil
which is the Luna Sunday Riley oil and
I've used it before but I kind of went
on and off with it and it's currently
making me break out a little bit so I
thought today would be the perfect day
to go ahead and test out this foundation
right here I also did get away from
first impressions for a while because I
feel like without a follow up first
impressions are useless and I
wasn't getting those a follow up sin so
what I plan on doing is every time I do
a foundation in a Friday which will
probably be two times a month I'm gonna
go ahead and update you guys the
following week and my sales and holy
grails of video so you guys can see how
it worked for me throughout that whole
entire week so I can give you guys a
thorough follow up but anyway today
we're testing out the uLTA Beauty HD
soft focus liquid foundation as you guys
can see right here this is a beautiful
foundation or at least it looks like it
is the claims on here are super super
strong it says it has a natural finished
paraben free it's oil free on the back
you can see the ingredients are listed
and the shade that I picked up is light
cool now there are currently let's see
here one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten in different shades that
you can pick up this is from the Alta
beauty brand so this is a cruelty free
foundation and it is $14 for one fluid
ounce of product which
a standard amount for a foundation now
like I said the claims on here are
pretty darn strong it says that it is
going to offer a beautiful silky texture
it provides medium to buildable full
coverage that lasts all day achieving a
natural flawless complexion it's also
supposed to be super hydrating and
brightening and ultra lightweight so I
feel like that's a lot of claims for a
foundation but we will test it out
anyway it says it's formulated to
include a moisture balancing system that
a hibbett the formation at age and
prevents the loss of elasticity which
helps reduce visible signs of aging so I
mean we'll see about that but yeah I'm
super excited to try it out looking from
the ingredients here kind of seems like
this easy silicon based foundation
because of that I'm going to apply it
with a silicon based primer I will be
using my it cosmetics field the moment
primer and I'm going to use a foundation
brush on half of my face and then I'm
going to use a damp sponge on the other
half so let me zoom you guys in and
we'll get started right guys oh I
just knock stuff over okay alrighty guys
I've got my headband on I never can
understand how people do first
impressions or even their makeup without
putting a huge headband on I just I
can't do it anyway I'm gonna jump into
the it cosmetics feel at the moment
primer I usually just run my hands down
at the actual dropper and I am going to
apply this absolutely everywhere onto my
face as a primer let me know with next
week's video I'm gonna be testing out
the it cosmetics what does it call the
by bylines foundation let me know if you
want me to do half primer on one side
and then and no primer on the other I
just felt like today I wanted to try two
different tools because I've been loving
my blend and Burt blur foundation brush
from Real Techniques but I've also loved
my sponge for years from Real Techniques
so I thought that if I did primer with
this sponge or primer with the brush
like it still might not be the best so
let me know if you would like me to do a
half primer and then the same sort of
appliance or application a technique
next week but anyway I'm just kind of
pushing this into my skin I'm gonna take
a little bit around my eye area because
when I test out foundations I also like
to see if they can double as concealer
I'm just really into that so that's what
I'm gonna do but anyway let's go ahead
and jump right into to the foundation so
like I said
shada have us late cool I'm a little
worried it might be too late so I do
have my next Pro Foundation mixer in 4th
here just in case but let's just pump
this out ok it is really liquidy and it
actually looks like it's gonna be a
really good match so I'm just gonna take
a little bit of that and I am going to
start over here on this side of my face
and I'm just kind of dabbing this on it
smells like paint it kind of smells like
the wet-and-wild foundation I don't love
that but it feels really really silky so
I'm just dabbing a little bit of that on
that was what about 2 or 3 pumps which
is a lot so let me go ahead and blend
this in with this foundation brush and
we'll see kind of how it looks well that
is going on very very nicely mmhmm yes
yes yes yes and then on the left side of
my face I do want to go in it with the
sponge like I said but I feel like this
actually looks great I think that went
on really nicely on this side ok let's
go ahead and take that remaining product
and I'll start working that onto the
left side of my face like I said because
I do have a more you know normal dry
skin I'm not necessarily looking for a
 ton of coverage and the more
coverage you go with dry skin like the
shitty or your skin will look to be
completely honest so I'm just gonna
tapping this on now I'm gonna go in with
the Real Techniques sponge Ifill feeling
because this is really liquidy which I
wasn't expecting that this sponge might
absorb a large amount of this product
but we will see yeah I kind of feel like
I prefer the side with the brush
actually you know what it looks kind of
pretty on this side too and then we're
gonna do the eyes as well all right
where I'm breaking out let's see if we
can kind of build this up a little bit
this looks really pretty I like this I
think this looks nice on the skin cool
ok let's see if we can build it up so
I'm going to take another pump onto my
fingers that I'm getting evenly
distribute that kind of where I have
like acne scarring as well as a little
bit of breakouts on each side trying to
just go evenly on each side and then
this side again we will do the brush
these kind of brushes I feel like I
really kind of pull at my skin so I'm
trying to hold it towards the bottom of
the handle so that I don't have as much
control
because that way I won't pull as much
but I think that looks nice I wouldn't
really say this is medium coverage I
would say it's me you know maybe medium
coverage um I don't think it's
particularly building that nicely I
think it looks way better on this side
you guys see this I actually feel like
it looks like you can really see my
pores over here almost like it's sitting
on top with the sponge that's kind of
weird it's like sinking into my pores
over here so I'm gonna finish off my
face with the brush because I think that
was the winner over here when with these
really liquidy foundations I do feel
like brushes look really nice but if I'm
gonna work it around my eyes I will go
in with a sponge because I feel like the
sponge is gonna be the winner as far as
that is concerned because hello sponges
are so nice for concealer and around the
eyes and everything like that alright
guys so that is all the coverage that I
personally need of course if I really
wanted to build this up maybe I could
but like I said I didn't really feel
like it built that much over here which
was interesting um hmm let me just
finish with a sponge like this to see if
I like that okay there we go
we'll use a combination of the sponge
and the brush sometimes I like to finish
off with the damp sponge just because
they will kind of make it a look a
little more skin like let's go ahead and
put this around the eyes you guys I'm
gonna take a little tiny half pump of
this I'm gonna pop it underneath my eyes
and on my eyelids a lot of foundations
will kind of age you around the eyes and
sometimes they don't look as good it
doubled as concealer but I also feel
like if I use a concealer and I'm
testing out a foundation it sometimes I
kind of forget like what's the concealer
and what's the foundation so I really
just want to use this one so let's go
ahead and do that see that looks really
pretty I can't actually it's funny
because going directly with the
foundation with the sponge I didn't like
it over here but if I blend with the
brush and then I finish it off with the
sponge which a lot of people do with
foundations in the first place just
because this is a really nice finishing
tool I think it looks really pretty so I
got like that around my nose I feel like
Ben
crevices like a little cakey but what do
you guys think I think this looks pretty
why don't we try one more layer I'm just
gonna do a get 1/2 bump right here and
let's just kind of dot this because I
know you guys are gonna want to see how
much coverage this can build I don't
necessarily feel like this is going to
full coverage to set a medium to
buildable full coverage but I'm not
really seeing that so I am liking the
combination of the brush with the sponge
I'm sorry I know that makes it kind of
difficult because it's like you know not
everybody has the brush and the sponge
some people just have the sponge or the
brush but it's just what's looking the
nicest this blends it out really nicely
but then this sponge finishes it off the
sponge is taking away maybe a little bit
of coverage but overall I think this
looks beautiful and the skin was
actually quite a nice match for me as
far as my skin tone is concerned it
might be a tad 10 light maybe a tad mmm
but it might oxidize a little bit down
here it looks a little light up here now
I'll just go ahead and finish off with
the sponge like I said a really really
small little tapping movements so around
the eye area it definitely didn't give
amazing coverage I'm just gonna have to
have a little bit of dark circles under
my eyes today I don't normally get huge
amounts of dark circles but it's been a
long work week so anyway we'll see but
here is what it's looking like you guys
so far so good
do you want to set this in I'm just
somebody who sets in my foundation so I
am going to go ahead and grab my kabuki
brush as well as my ELF tone correcting
powder and cool which is my ride-or-die
the essence all about Matt fixing
compactor at contact powder as well as
the L tone correcting powder are my
ride-or-die powders and I just feel like
they'll really lock the sand nicely all
day without disturbing the foundation
cuz like the different powders can
change the colour of their foundation
they can just start the finish and we
don't want to do that so let me go grab
the essence I'm sorry let me go grab at
the ELF powder because I feel like this
is gonna be a nice match with the L
powder it feels a little sticky and
tacky I'm gonna let it just sit and kind
of set before we go in with the powder
but I'll be back in a second it has been
about a minute and a half it still feels
a little sticky to the touch so I don't
know if I would wear this without
setting it in with a powder but here we
have the L tone correcting powder in
cool I'm gonna go in with my it
cosmetics one of this called Buki
buffing a brush and I'm gonna step
onto my skin it might lighten this
foundation up just a little too much so
I will go back in and I will take a
bronzer and kind of bronze my skin up
but this is what I like to do what with
foundations even with my dry skin I like
to stipple a powder on because I really
feel like it helps with the overall wear
time everybody feels differently about
this if you do have dry skin some people
don't want to set it in but I'm just one
of those people I really like the look
of a sec powder on top of the foundation
it really does help with longevity and
everything like that so I feel like it's
settling a little bit into my lines
right here and again over here when I
went in with that sponge the first time
around it almost kind of like sunk into
my pores and picked it up a little
patchy the brush side over here looked
much nicer and then my forehead is
looking up pretty good so far maybe got
a little dry when I powdered sometimes I
have to be careful with those super
super powerful densely packed brushes
like this but this is just my preferred
method for stuffing my face in
throughout the day it starts to look a
lot better and after I put my makeup on
and put my settings for you will as well
so anyway that is what everything is
looking like currently and yeah I will
check in with you guys after I put the
rest of my makeup on all right at my
full face of makeup is on I'm wearing
lighter makeup today just because I felt
like you know I don't have like full-on
concealer and all that kind of stuff
going on so I did go for a little bit of
a lighter makeup look
it is currently let's see here 11:07
a.m. so I am going to go ahead and go
about my day I won't have any like lucky
footage in Sirte just cuz I feel like
that belong on a vlog Channel I'm just
gonna do a check in in five hours then
probably at about eight hours I actually
have the day off from work today because
I have a blood transfusion for my
hemolytic anemia I'm also meeting with
my dad we're gonna go look at his new
condo he recently bought a condo here in
Phoenix and then we're also going to the
butterfly garden so I'm basically just
gonna hang out with my dad all day long
I'm actually gonna see if he wants to
help me set up the new background
because hey have the day off might as
well do it but yeah that's pretty much
what my day is going to consist of so I
will check in with you guys in about
five hours and then probably at about
eight hours and we'll see how it held up
usually I do wear up my makeup for
longer than eight hours if it's a full
workday but I just feel like eight hours
is a nice and
because any foundation after about ten
hours is gonna look like that look
like but you're gonna see where it
starts to break up on the face so eight
hours is gonna be perfect but yeah I
guess I will check you with you guys
probably around four or five o'clock hey
guys how's it going I am here to do at
my little check-in for you guys it is
currently 4:15 a p.m. here as you can
probably see it and so far so good with
this foundation I think it's looking
really beautiful is starting to break up
a little more around my mouth area like
I said earlier I feel like because I
have some texture going on in that area
in the first place I kind of knew that
was gonna happen but I haven't been
having any sort of oil breaking through
throughout the day that's really not
something that happens to me anymore and
now that I do have more normal to dry
skin but overall I'm thinking it looks
really a really a nice so I don't have
too much to say I think I will check in
in another two hours and we will do a
close ups and we can kind of see how it
wore throughout the day but yeah it's
been about five hours and so far so good
it is currently 631 p.m. here so I have
almost been wearing this foundation for
a full eight hours I just wanted to give
you guys my final thoughts or my first
impressions final thoughts and then
obviously in my field some Holy Grails
next weekend I will let you guys know
what my final final thoughts are on the
Alta PD HD soft focus liquid foundation
I think for $14 especially considering I
got this buy one get one 50% off because
the uLTA Beauty brand is always on sale
I think it really is a good foundation I
definitely am noticing a lot of texture
and a little bit of stuff falling apart
around my nose in my mouth area but like
I said earlier I'm having a lot of big
pimples in this area I'm having a lot of
texture in this area and I feel like
it's very hard to get a foundation to
sit nicely when you have these big big
big kind of pimples like this but
overall it's sitting beautifully on my
forehead is sitting nicely on the rest
of my skin and nothing looks too cakey I
think I might have over powdered a
little bit earlier but I did go in at
probably around 6 hours in and I used
some of my Too Faced hangover RX
three-in-one replenishing primer spray
just to kind of mist all over and give a
little more skin like appearance instead
of like a powdery appearance to the skin
but overall I think
hung in there really really nicely this
shade right here is a perfect match for
me with one layer of self-tanner the
shade is called a light cool and they
also have a leg warm they have a deep
warm they have a deep cool I like that
they have different undertones and ah so
far I'm really happy with it I thought
it hung in there and nicely so yeah
that's pretty much all I have to say for
first impressions as far as like a
five-star scale is concerned I would
give this a solid a 3 star rating but of
course I need to play with it for the
rest of the week and then I will let you
guys know next weekend not this coming
weekend but next weekend what I think of
it so anyway I hope you enjoyed this
first impressions thank you so much for
joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow for my December 2017 and make
up a wish list bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
