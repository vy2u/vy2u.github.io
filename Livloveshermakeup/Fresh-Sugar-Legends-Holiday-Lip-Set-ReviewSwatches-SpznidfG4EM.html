today's video is going to be a review on
the new fresh sugar legends which is one
of their holiday hits from fresh
cosmetics and this is $55 it is a $79
value and you are getting seven deluxe
sized lip balms which are their tinted
lip balms which normally run for I
believe $22.50 so this is like a great
deal and I was so excited when I picked
this up it has been sold out online so I
actually did pick this up in store but I
wanted to show you guys the swatches so
here they are I'll start right here the
first one is called cherry the second
one is called honey the third one is
called tulip the fourth one is called
passion the fifth one is called petal
this fixed one is called berry and the
last one is called Rosie and I am
wearing berries on my lips right now I
don't know if you guys can tell um it is
quite I don't really know what happened
with that swatch but it is quite
pigmented I think it's a beautiful berry
color and I really really love these um
lip balms I'm going to be doing a video
on specifically my favorite tinted lip
balm so hopefully if you guys um you
know are interested or if maybe you
can't afford this set or just one of
them for 2250 which is pretty ridiculous
hopefully you guys can get some other
ideas from that video because I will
have drugstore options there but I will
show you guys up close what the little
kit looks like I love the packaging
they're really really sturdy they
actually screw on instead of snap on so
I think that is like really really good
and again I will show you the swatches
and remember these are not going to give
you full color these are tinted lip
balms but they are so so moisturizing so
I hope you guys enjoyed this video if
you did please give this
do a thumbs up and I will see you in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
