thank you so much for joining me I hope
you guys are having a fantastic day I am
here without makeup today my eyes are a
little watery because it's very cold out
I don't know if this ever happens to you
guys but you'll be walking outside and
your eyes start watering and then it's
just like you're like crime and your
makeups like coming off but anyway I
have kind of watery eyes today but
please excuse that I am here to show you
guys my full coverage foundation routine
this is something I would wear on stage
or if I'm having my photograph taken you
know special events things like that I'm
not recommending that you wear this for
everyday use however if you do have a
really bad hyperpigmentation or active
breakouts things like that you can do
whatever your heart desires you could
wear this every day if you want to it is
a very very heavy though that's kind of
my little disclaimer um I had made a
video about what was it maybe four or
five months ago wow I was kind of a long
time ago no maybe not that long ago it
was in the summer I made a video and I
showed you guys my fast and easy quick
light foundation routine I will link
that video below so that you guys can go
and check that out if you are not
interested in the full coverage one but
in that video I kept telling you guys I
can show you my full coverage foundation
routine using the Estee Lauder will wear
a double wear Estee Lauder Double Wear
foundation and I just never got to it
but here I am now I'm in my beauty room
I can film tutorials so that's what I'm
doing today I'm going to show you guys
everything from primer to setting in
this kind of heavy makeup I do want to
stay at my friend Leora or Leora's
makeup love's 52 did make a full
coverage foundation routine video last
week I'm gonna link hers below we do
have similar skin types we have
basically kind of like the same skin
tone except she's a little more yellow
undertone whereas I have a little more
pink I'm a little more cool undertones
but we have the same sort of issues
where we both have had hormonal acne
where we get it like ah we have nice
crying on our cheeks and that's kind of
where we break out and we both have
combination skin so if you are
interested in seeing somebody else's
view on the same sort of tutorial you
can go and check out her video I will
link
below but anyway this is kind of gonna
be like a talk through and I'm gonna
share with you guys some tips and tricks
and also give you different
recommendations if you don't want to
spend a lot of money on you know
high-end products so the first thing I
highly recommend doing when you are
working with a full-coverage product
usually when you're working with a
full-coverage product whether it be face
makeup or eye makeup things like that it
tends to be a little more drying or fast
it dries very quickly basically the
Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation
dries very very quickly so does um you
don't like the Revlon Colorstay things
like that these have very very high
pigments and very very high like a high
amount of coverage so what I recommend
is starting with a base or a primer that
has silicone in it because it's gonna
give you a little bit of a slip so that
when you're working with these kind of
heavy duty products you're gonna be able
to move them a little quicker you're
gonna be able to let them sit on your
face a little longer before you have to
really start blending them in so then
what I'm going to be using today is from
Maybelline this is the baby skin instant
pore eraser and I am just going to take
a nice little dollop of that about that
much and I'm going to put it all over my
face I'm just spreading this absolutely
everywhere and I really like this one
because it has that sort of slip to it
you know that silicone II slip to it
which like I said is really going to
help when you're working with a product
that dries really quickly and had a lot
of coverage alright now that we have
done that I'm just going to let that sit
for a couple of seconds and I'm going to
talk to you guys about concealer we're
going to be concealing before we do our
foundation that's just kind of the way I
like to do it I sometimes do go in with
concealer after and maybe do like a
triangle to brighten up my eyes things
like that but for this video we are
going to be going in with concealer
first before our foundation
the one I'm using today is from hard
candy you can get this at Walmart or you
know just now I don't want to save the
drugstore because it's exclusively sold
at Walmart but you can also get it
online it is from hard candy this is the
glamoflage heavy duty concealer and my
shade is ultra light this is almost a
little light on my skin which is another
reason I want to put it on first so
there are different you know concealers
you can get that are very very heavy
duty coverage like this another one that
I want to recommend from the drugstore
is the Wet n Wild come correct celebrity
concealer by Fergie this is also very
very high coverage and very nice and the
shade I have is a 111 fair but anyway
like I said we are going to be using the
glamoflage one today so I'm just going
to take a little bit of that out and I'm
going to put that on to my finger and I
am going to put this on the areas that I
really want to conceal and areas that I
really want to conceal are basically the
areas where I have acne scars a few
little active breakouts and then also a
my eye area I recommend giving at this
concealer a good little shake so that it
doesn't separate but I'm just kind of
dabbing it on the areas where I have
acne scarring and any little active
breakouts I'm not really as you can
probably tell spending a lot of time
worrying about where it's going I'm just
kind of bluffing it on for now and we
will blend it in after under my eyes
kind of doing a little bit of a V and I
also take it on my eyelids so that is
what we look like now so what we're
gonna do is then go in with a damp
sponge you can also use a brush if you
want to but I find that sponges are nice
because they really push the product
into the skin this is the Real
Techniques sponge and I am just going to
take this point aside and I'm going to
start Boland day basically and I'm just
pushing this product into my skin that's
what I love like I said that's what I
love about sponges is that it allows you
to push the product into your skin
you're not swiping like you would with a
brush you are literally pushing it into
your skin and I think that is what
allows you to keep
coverage as far as concealing and
putting on foundation and things like
that
now if you feel like you need even more
concealing I technically could go back
in and kind of hit up a few more areas
I'm not going to though because we are
going to be wearing about one and a half
layers of foundation so there's really
no need to do that but this was just to
kind of get rid of any sort of
discoloration I would say you have to
remember especially with concealing and
things like that concealers can cover
color they cannot cover texture so the
more you you know trying kcon over
texture like I have an active breakout
here the more cakey it's going to get
you can really only cover color it just
kind of let the texture base all right
so now you're going to go ahead and go
into our foundation like I said I will
be using my Estee Lauder Double Wear
today on the sheet that Ayman is one N
one
ivory nude you guys can see that but I
do want to give you guys some
recommendations from the drugstore as
well that I think are comparable in
coverage to this so the first one I want
to recommend is from L'Oreal the
infallible Pro matte 24 hour foundation
is really really good I would say two
full layers of this will give you the
coverage of one layer of the Estee
Lauder Double Wear and one full layer of
the Revlon Colorstay at whether it be
the whipped or the original formula will
give you at the same amount of coverage
as the one layer at the Estee Lauder so
if you don't want to pick up the Estee
Lauder the Revlon Colorstay or the
L'Oreal infallible Pro matte are really
really great alternatives all right so
we're gonna shake this foundation up
first a little bit and then I'm going to
open it up and put a little bit on the
back of my hand it's better to work in a
kind of I guess you could say sections
with this foundation it's just one of
those things where if you work um I
don't know if you put it all over your
face and you go too quickly you may have
some issues if that makes sense
I couldn't open that top but anyway so
like I said we're going to work in small
sections of this foundation I'm
you guys it comes out too quickly too
quickly anyway we have about that much
all right
so what you're going to do is go back in
with our sponge I'm going to tap it
right in there and we're going to start
working on one part of our face at a
time I'm going to start working on my
cheeks first because that's where I want
to cover the most and I am going kind of
quickly as you guys can see and I am
patting this into the skin
and I think you guys can probably
instantly see the coverage that it has
given my skin
okay so just continue doing that and
then you want to dip back into the
product that you have on the back of
your hand dip back in there again what
is on my face
there's like a little piece of fuzz I
can feel it and then I'm going to go to
the other side like I said you really
want to do this in sections because this
stuff dries quickly you want to pick it
down your neck as well I can't forget
the neck area oh you know I got these
little tiny bumps on my neck this
morning I had I think allergic reaction
to a neck cream that I used last night
they're not pimples or just like these
little red dots so I opted for a scarf
today I figure any time I wake up with
little red marks all over me I'm gonna
cover it up whether it be with makeup or
a scarf
anyway if you guys know what those are
those little tiny bumps that you get
from just like topical irritation I can
tell they're not breakout so I'm like
this like it alright again I'm gonna
take a little more on the back of my
hand of the Estee Lauder Double Wear and
we're gonna go ahead and work on of the
forehead tapping that in and putting it
on our forehead
and what we're working with small
sections like this it gives the other
areas time to kind of dry and not really
dry but set it's not going to set fully
without a powder I find that this
foundation just won't but it is going to
be somewhat set you know it will dry
down a little more basically
alright then we're gonna go back and
take a little more I know but I told you
guys full coverage and I'm going to take
a little bit more of that and we're
gonna hit the areas like that we really
want some full coverage from me that's
on kind of my jaw line and my cheek area
where I have those acne scars a little
bit on my chin and then a little more on
my forehead so these areas are basically
getting one and a half layers of
foundation plus they've already been
concealed you can imagine how heavy this
is starting to feel but like I said it
is a very very full coverage I feel like
I gave a good disclaimer when you're
down the neck into the ear as well
always important blend
all right and that is the foundation
next we're gonna let that just sit for a
little bit like I told you guys it will
somewhat set not fully but it's gonna
kind of set like halfway I would say I'm
gonna wipe my lips foundation all over
them I hate when that happens especially
when you wear like a full coverage
foundation that's like wow my lips are
gone but anyway we're gonna let that
kind of semi set and then we're gonna go
ahead and go in with there are two
different ways you can do this now you
can either go in with a powder
foundation mmm yep yes I said it the one
that I have here today is the benefit
hello flawless and the reason I said
mmhmm yeah you heard me right is because
we have a lot of product on our face
right now and going on even more with a
powder foundation is going to make it
look even more flawless I'm promising
you it's not going to look too cakey but
like I said we are going for a full
coverage look so anyway this will give
even more coverage or you can go in with
just a you know basically translucent
sort of powder this is the Revlon nearly
naked in the shade zero one zero fair so
let's see how this is doing my eye area
it's a little oh do you see that Haven
that happens that's like from the
allergy thing it's like it uh it gets
all like wet there and then it won't
like set I hate that alright so what I'm
gonna do first is go in with the Revlon
nearly naked and if we need more
coverage I will use the benefit so what
I like to use is a very very flat top
kabuki that is dense I am going to be
using my if cosmetics this is the Buki
buffing brush and I like it because like
I said it's dense and we are going to be
pushing this product into our skin we
are not wiping and swiping this product
we're getting a good amount and then we
are pushing it into our skin when you
push like this just like basically with
the foundation you are not swiping and
wiping
I feel like when you do that when you
use a brush or when you kind of swipe
and use a swiping motion even if you use
it with a beauty blender I've seen
people that go like this with the Beauty
Blender it is actually taking away
coverage so for a full coverage
foundation look we really want
everything to look as full coverage as
possible so I am basically pushing this
into my skin and stippling it on top
this particular powder sometimes has a
little bit of a pink undertone on me but
that's okay because how we're going to
completely set everything in I'll show
you in a minute but I'm kind of working
quickly here and just pushing it in to
the skin and I think this is the time
where you guys will be able to see how
flawless this starts to look on the skin
I feel like powder really does a lot
I love powdering my face I know some
people don't but I feel like powder
really is what makes everything look
really really amazing I don't want you
guys to see my little like broken out
hives neck I don't know what it is I'm
so upset I'll put some honey on there or
something tonight that helps us alright
so now we have completely set the
foundation as you can see and the next
thing I am going to do is go in with
basically a silica sort of powder or a
very very light HD powder and the one
I'm using is going to be the it
cosmetics hold on it cosmetics abide by
pores this is the airbrush silk pressed
finishing powder with collagen silk
peptides and antioxidants and this is in
the shade translucent and I'm going to
be taking it with this bu beautifully
Pro flat kabuki brush my friend Leora
recommended this for me I will link it
down below where you can get it from
Amazon this is nice because it is very
very similar to the cosmetics one that I
use for my powder however the difference
is
this one gives a lot more you guys can
see powder shooting up it gives a lot
more so I'm going to be basically using
the buffing technique and working this
into my skin and you guys are going to
be able to see just how much of a
difference that makes as well so I am
making small circular motions all over
my face I hate that it like came off my
eye area I hate when that happens what
do you guys do for that when you have
allergies and things like that what do
you do when is your makeup starts to
like peel off in certain areas so we are
just doing small circular motions you
can probably see powder flying
everywhere
just imagine what it's like using the
loose version of this this is the
pressed one but um I love this because
it has those really really nice small
little particles in it that really just
make the skin look that much more
beautiful they really it just kind of
finishes off the skin in a gorgeous
gorgeous way and one thing that I do
like to do hold on okay one thing that I
do like to do is um I use like the it
cosmetics bye bye pores I use that
basically to completely buff like I use
the buffing technique but I use it after
I put on my blush and my bronzer and
things like that so you don't
necessarily have to do this step right
after you did like you set your
foundation you can actually do it after
you put everything on and it will make
things blend in even more seamlessly on
the skin so anyway that is that you guys
this is my full coverage foundation look
like I said you can substitute a lot of
these products with drugstore products
the primer I used was drugstore the
concealer I used was drugstore but you
can also use the Fergie one that come
correct the powder that I used to set
everything was also drugstore or you can
even if you want to go even heavier use
a powder foundation and you know these
are two awesome awesome alternatives to
the Estee Lauder wear foundation the
l'oreal infallible
Pro mapped in the Revlon Colorstay
whipped or the original one so I hope
you guys enjoyed this I'm sorry my eyes
are all itchy and runny and I'm sure you
guys can relate but anyway I do hope you
enjoyed this full coverage foundation
look I think it's beautiful
it really makes the skin look gorgeous
and perfect by the time you're done with
everything and yeah thank you so much
for joining me and I'll see you in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
