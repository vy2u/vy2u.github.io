channel today I am sharing with you guys
a full-face get ready with me using a
new makeup now this is not all first
impressions I do have the new the bet
that lilac geode yes I like to yeah
lilac go2 shimmering skin perfecter
press to share with you guys I've been
playing with that for about a week I
have the Anasazi of Beverly Hills blush
trio I've been playing with that for
about two weeks I also have the color
pop let's see here yes please palette
which I have been playing with for
probably about three weeks and then also
the give me more highlighting palette
which I want to review for you guys and
then I do have a brow product here from
Smashbox that is a brand new to me I
literally just got this in the mail
today so that's gonna be a true first
impressions it is called these smashbox
brow tech to go in the shade of taupe
but yeah basically i have not done one
of these any very a long time sorry if
my hair looks a little messed up and
literally I've just been doing pretty
much like practicing and cleaning around
the house all day but yeah that's what
we're gonna be doing so let's go ahead
and jump right into it guys we're gonna
start with the primer I'm gonna take my
Becca first light priming filter and I'm
gonna take three pumps of this on to a
flat-topped foundation a brush lately I
have been going ahead and doing stuff
like this because I just personally I
feel like I pull at my skin way too much
so I've been using a brush to apply at
my primers let me fix my mare here it's
kind of bent over the other way but yeah
I just feel like I really really do kind
of pull at my skin and that is not
necessarily a good thing so I'm
basically just applying this in doing
downward of stroking emotions I really
do like does a Beca first like priming
filter I'm not a fan of the backlight
but the first light is really nice in my
opinion God my hair looks like such a
freaking mess but anyway I hope you guys
have any other day at a Sunday and we
are about to watch a game of Thrones
tonight which it is the season of finale
oh my god I really really really hope
that Khaleesi gets together with Jon
Snow I know that they're like related
but that would be everything I mean not
the fact that they're related it was the
fact that they're so cute together okay
moving on let's go ahead and jump into a
little bit of eye primer I'm gonna go
ahead and take my Urban Decay eye shadow
potion in the anti-aging of version and
again I have been applying this with a
brush just because I pull on my
 eyes like a lot so I'm
gonna take the Alexia 2:05 a tapered
blending brush I'm just gonna put a
little bit of this primer on and then
I'm gonna blend it in with that
particular brush feel like my camera is
completely upset right now it's kind of
driving me nuts I'm just taking it right
on to my middle fingers kind of tapping
it on and then we're gonna blend it in
with the brush like I said because I'm
just one of those people like I up whole
X my skin like a mofo so just kind of
blending that in lightly I have really
fallen in love with this eyeshadow
primer I don't know if it's just because
I'm aging or what it is but yeah it
really seems to go on nicely I don't
like eye primers that are super super
sticky and tacky that just kind of
pisses me off because I'm it's so hard
to blend your eyeshadow on top like I
get it helps with the longevity but day
out is hard to blend if you have a
really sticky tacky primer alright guys
now we're gonna jump into a little bit
of a base I have it the hourglass
illusion hyaluronic skin tint in the
shade vanilla here I'm gonna take a nice
sized amount right on two of my fingers
like this and I'm just gonna go ahead
and distribute this onto my face and
then we're gonna blend it in with a damp
sponge this has been my go-to foundation
or my go-to base lately I just
absolutely love it I think it's
incredible it's really really beautiful
and like I said to blend that in I'm
taking a diamond sponge here from Real
Techniques it is damp and it is a
freaking stained so I'm just taking at
the bottom part here and I'm just
tapping this in a two of my skin I do
push a little more hard I don't know why
but I just feel like because this is a
little bit of like a Lucy consistency it
really helps me kind of stamp the
product in there you guys can probably
see it as a little light for me
currently I definitely have gotten a
little bit of a tan I know a lot of you
don't believe it you're like it's not
true he looks pale but I have
got a little bit of color down here so
this shade right here is a little on the
light side for me but I do feel like it
starts to oxidize it turns a little more
pink tone so it ends up matching me
eventually so anyway just kind of
pushing that in and then I'm gonna take
it down on my neck a little bit as well
God my hair is literally driving me
insane but anyway
you know down below if you guys also
watched house of cards house of cards
Game of Thrones and house cars let me
know too and if you want
khaleesi ordinarius to be with Jon Snow
because I am flippin a shipping that
 okay
alright now I'm taking my Too Faced Born
This Way naturally radiant concealer in
the shade very fair I'm just gonna hit
this right underneath my eye area and
then also on any areas where I have
little spots on my face which currently
am breaking out so I've got him go in
there they here I got one right there
like I want I'm over two plates and then
I'm just gonna blend this in with these
same espanish and I'm taking the more
like point to end this time I really
like taking this for getting right into
the like the little crevices underneath
the eye because you guys can see the
sponge gets really friggin tiny towards
the top so it's great it is great
alright blending that in and then we're
gonna go ahead and set the stand up with
a powder I have the L'Oreal infallible
Pro matte which is what I'm trying to
use up in my collection so I just
thought I'd set my face in with that
today also because this foundation is a
little light on my skin I want something
that will darken it up and this shade
right here called porcelain is actually
super dark so I'm just gonna take my air
buffer foundation brush from tarts I'm
gonna dip into this product and then I'm
gonna stipple this around my eye area
first then I'm gonna go into my t-zone
and then I set the rest of my face a lot
of people were asking me because um I
have more I was gonna say combo to Lane
no because I'm not combo to oily skin
anymore I have more normal to dry skin
do I still set my entire face I do just
because I do feel like it gives a little
more longevity to your foundation the
makeup stays on a little longer so I
still do set my entire face and you guys
know my favorite way to do that is to
just really really kind of pack the
powder on I just feel like it looks a
lot better it helps it to last all day
and then I take a little down my neck
here as well you guys can see this
powder definitely turned up that
foundation I do not understand what this
powder is so dark like the foundation is
actually really nice and light the pro
matte foundation but for some reason
this powder is hella dark so
alright let's go ahead and move on
pillows my neck is super white now let
me just kind of take this down here as
well I'm not gonna brought into my face
just because I feel like it already
looks kind of pink with that powder but
like I said if I used a normal powder or
like my out tone correcting powder it
would be way to love this little
sweatshirt dress it would be way too
light still but I don't go in the front
door every day because who's got time
for that alright let's go ahead and jump
into blush now I'm gonna take my Real
Techniques blush brush and I'm dipping
into the anastacio Beverly Hills blush
trio in the shade of peachy and love
okay I'm gonna take this guy right here
which is called nectarine I love this
blush trio you guys I am in love now I
really feel like I have to use a fluffy
brush with these or else they really
really go on a little too strong I'm
just kind of taking it and putting it
sort of towards the apple of my cheek
I've been trying not to do the apple of
my cheek thing because I recently saw a
video from who was it Wayne Goss who
said like if you do the apple of your
cheek like a smile and then you let your
cheeks down it's no longer on the apple
of your cheek clearly so I've just been
kind of putting it a little higher
towards on my cheekbone area and I'm
just blending that back and forth like I
said these are ultra pigmented they're
super smooth though you know they go
onto the skin beautifully I feel like
you can layer them but my favorite
shading here for sure is nectarine okay
I have to fix this is just
driving me insane literally look like a
cockatoo my hair my hair look look or
two
alright so I'm just kind of taking it
and going really lightly like that it
gives just the perfect amount of color
if you use a fluffy brush if you go in
with a density pack brush it's
screwed so don't do that unless you're
really good at makeup which I'm not but
that's okay alright now I'm gonna go in
back OS that's hard to brush which I use
to set my face then I'm just going over
the areas because I always have pretty
patchy lookin blush so I just like to
blend that cheek ya know alright now
we're going to jump into the color pop
give you more highlighting palette I
want to take this middle shade right
here which is kind of like a light pink
and I'm gonna take that with my luck C
522 tapered highlighter brush just as a
little bit of a base and then we're
gonna go in with the new a Becca a
highlight as well
highlighting palette is okay I got to
admit I'm not as in love with it as I am
it with the yes please palette I really
love the way that yes please looks on
the skin but this guy for some reason I
feel like doesn't pick up as nicely but
I like it if you've used a little more
of like a dense impact brush this is
probably not to be right brush to kind
of demo it with if you know what I mean
what is this what is this well hope if I
have but I feel like it's not really the
right brush to demo with demo it's with
because it really needs that sort of a
densely packed brush the one that I'm
thinking of is like a sigma tapered
highlighter brush that one goes a lot
better but I want to mix it so that's
okay so here is the new Becca shimmering
skin Perfector press in lilac geode it
is seven grams of product kind of like
the rose quartz they've started to give
you one gram less of product which is
kind of crazy I know a lot of people
complained when you had the Becca light
shades or highlighters those actually
aren't that different seven or eight
grams of product I know a lot of people
were like they're so small they just
look small they have a similar amount of
product in them but yeah because they do
this little design here you don't get as
much product but anyway I'm gonna dip
into that with again that same Alexi
brush this is the same exact formula is
all of the Becca shimmering skin
perfecter price as you can see it's
hella powdery so you want to be very
careful but I take this right onto the
cheekbones and I bring it down onto the
apples of my cheeks and it honestly is
 amazing this reminds me exactly
like almost identical to like the I mean
not the same sort of thing but it
reminds me a lot of the what is it NARS
orgasm blush it's got like that peachy
pinky kind of vibe but it has that gold
running through it and I think it's just
 stunning especially if you do
have a little bit of a tan if you're
super pale this might be a tad a too
dark for you maybe you could use it as a
blush topper but I really love this you
guys can see the glow it's beautiful I'm
living for it yes alright so moving on
so yes I would recommend this you guys
limited edition which totally sucks but
it's a beautiful color unlike anything
and the Becca has really released to be
completely honest I did not pick up the
smoky quartz or the I believe they're
still gonna release that golden mint
shade but maybe I will get smoky quartz
cuz this one is just so beautiful do you
guys see that glow
all right now let's move on to hmm I
guess we should move on to brows I'm
Derek I'm beard all right here
is the smashbox brow tech to go like I
said this is literally gonna be first
impressions
I'm already shakin my hands are shakin
alright let's see how this goes okay so
it's got brow gel on one side I need to
spoolie out my brows first before I just
like dig in so I'm gonna have to put the
brow gel in right now because I don't
have a spoolie on hand and then the
actual product so it's cut length a
little like I said the brown on one side
let's take this off oh my god this is
very intimidating do you see that it's
like a freaking slicer or some
alright let's take the front part of the
brow first we're just gonna fill that in
I'm gonna turn it to an angle and we'll
fill that part in right underneath a
little towards the top here
shaking I get so nervous when I try new
brow products cuz like I feel like it
could go either way like I couldn't
literally my makeup up to the point
where like I have to start over or it
could be really good alright that's
looking pretty good let's go ahead and
fill in the arch a little bit just for a
little bit of added thickness nice I
like this color it's a little darker but
honestly a lot of you have been saying
lately because my hair is a little
darker right now the darker Brown looks
better so weird because it's so pointed
but I don't feel like I'm getting a huge
amount of precision towards the front
here it's just really kind of I don't
know this one looks a little looks a
little funky but I think I'll leave it
at that cuz it's a little strong that's
actually pretty darn dark so let me just
run that brow gel through here again so
we can kind of spoolie these out don't
give me too much of a hard time in the
comment section I literally the first
time I've ever used this but looks
pretty nice I mean I think it looks it
worked well you know
no no maybe I'll try going a little
thicker tomorrow with this particular
Braille product looks a little dark
does it look a little dark to you guys
seems a little dark out a little messed
up here but I guess I just need to play
with it more so all people aim with that
I'll give you guys that my final
thoughts I guess I might feel similar
grass on Sunday but first impressions
wise it's okay I don't know with a
really sharp tip like that you would
think it would be a little more exact
but that's great that's okay now let's
go ahead and jump into the colour-pop
cute as yes please palette I'm
going to start with this lighter shade
right here and I am going to take my BH
Cosmetics fluffy crease brush I'm just
gonna take that and put this all over my
lid I'm also gonna put this all over my
under-eye because I don't know I just
really like doing that with the lightest
shade in a palette I just kind of run it
underneath the under eye seems to work
really well for me just to kind of set
everything also helps so that blending
is easier especially if you're gonna
smoke out your lower lash line all right
now with that same brush I'm gonna take
this guy right here which has been my
favorite transition from the palette
it's a little sandy like it's a little
on the dark side but that's okay I'm
basically going to take this onto my lid
and up into my crease and I'm just
blending really kind of sloppily because
I want the color everywhere sort out if
that makes sense that make sense doesn't
make sense so I'm just taking in doing
circular motions back and forth I'm just
going that's what I'm doing alright
moving on it let's go ahead and jump
into I'm gonna take the morphe m5 13
brush and I'm gonna take let's take this
guy right here this kind of like burnt
orange shade I'm gonna work that into
the outer V I recently learned that by
the way you have to tap off the excess
with these shadows here or else you're
 screwed keep saying that about a
lot of products but you really are
because these literally could probably
hit pan kind of like the Anasazi of
Beverly Hills subculture I could see
these doing the same sort of thing so
basically I'm taking this into the outer
V and I'm doing small circular motions I
recently found out that I have
pointing semi hooded eyes which like I
didn't even know somebody could have
that many eye shapes but apparently I do
I always thought you could only have one
eye shape I kind of have a little bit of
deep set eyes I thought for a while
there I truly had hooded eyes but you
guys can see I do have a crease there
and it is visible especially when I'm
wearing primer but the way that I was
doing my eye shadow you really kind of
couldn't tell you know so I found out I
had a crease which is great good to know
that I have a crease um and now I'm
gonna take a morpheme 5-11 and blend and
I'm just going to do circular motions
again and I'm lifting this and bring it
a little higher but anyway so when I
learned that I had this eyes shape I
started looking up tutorials and
suddenly like I feel like everything has
just been easier learning to put stuff
just on the outer V and not bring it all
the way in towards the inner part of
your eye is really good because if you
do have downward pointing eyes like I do
you want to lift things up and a lot of
people will say like use liquid eyeliner
if you have downward pointing eyes
unfortunately for me personally look a
liner is just not like I'm not good at
it I can't do it you know what I mean so
that's just out of the question
but doing your eye makeup like this and
kind of working just on the outer V and
bringing it up will elongate your eyes
and lift them up and it's just been
really great knowing what my eye
shape is I'm enjoying it so anyway like
I said I'm just kind of lifting it up
and doing small circular motions
bringing it higher and higher and then
I'm gonna go in with that same morphe
brush that I did when I first deposited
the color cuz it started to kind of
blend out a little more now and I want
to take let's see here I'm gonna go for
the more deep kind of red shade which is
right next to that one it's right there
and again I'm just gonna do the same
exact thing so I'm just gonna take that
color I'm gonna place it on to the outer
V and then do small circular motions
keeping it in the lower crease and then
when I blend I bring it up if that makes
sense if you want this to be super
defined you could definitely put down a
piece of tape I haven't tried it that
way yet but maybe I should so just
putting it down small circular motions
in the lower crease and then again
blending up with that morphe at 5:11
when I did my morphe video which I'll go
ahead and throw up in the cards
talked about how there are a few
products from morphe I actually like and
this brush with one of them I mean
there's not products form or feel like
there's brushes from morphe alike and
this is definitely one of them it is
just shaped so much differently than a
lot of a brushes out there I mean it
kind of feels a little crispy to the eye
but it's got this really they have
really long bristles going on here and I
like that so gun just bringing this a
little higher so that it gets a little
like diffused I mean I don't know if I
could ever do diffused eye you
guys know what I mean I'm not really
like a diffuse kind of girl because
let's be honest I don't spend that much
time blending but just the small
circular motions really really do help
all right so just to bring me an up
alright now let's go ahead and do a
little bit of a lip color I'm gonna take
the should take the gold or the yellow
in here I think I'm gonna take the gold
so that's the gold shade right there I'm
just gonna pop that right onto my lid
and I'm gonna look down in the mirror so
I can see what I'm doing so I'm just
popping that right on to the inner part
of the lid I just preferred the way that
these go on the shimmer shades in here I
just prefer the way they go on with my
finger if you want to foil them and pop
them on with like a densely packed
shader brush or something I'm sure that
would work as well but this is just what
I prefer to make sure they don't like
budge in certain places I'm kind of
going back and forth with my finger all
right I'm gonna do a little more on the
right side cuz they don't feel like I
picked up as much product it's the only
problem about doing like the finger
thing and sometimes it doesn't pick up
cronic equally but alright now let's go
ahead and Fuu I'm gonna take up my wet
and wild crease brush and I'm just gonna
blend towards the top here make sure
everything's properly blended make sure
there aren't a bunch of harsh lines or
try and get rid of the harsh lines
I think these collar pop shadows are
pretty good like from this palette was
pretty good I know shoes with the
ephemeral soft palette so that one never
got delivered to me they like said that
I got it they said he was too Marquardt
everything was all good and then
unfortunately I just never showed up and
I called color Bob and I email
Elden like I don't know what happened
they gave me my money back on all right
that's not bad
I'd love to get that pallet I just don't
know what's going on all right now going
in on the lower lash line I'm going to
take that organ G sheet again and I'm
gonna take a sigma e25 brush and I'm
just gonna put that right onto the lower
lash line kind of smoking it out now
this is a pretty big brush to do this
with but I was watching a Stephanie Lang
yeah Stephanie Lang do this and she
doesn't really really smoked out lower
lashline not everybody's into this look
but for me I don't love the way it looks
initially but I think for me it's a good
lesson to learn because I'm one of those
people that will take like a pencil
brush and I go really crazy and then I
just do a harsh line and so this is a
good way for me I know it looks crazy
but this is a good way from me to learn
to have a little more of like a smoky
look on the lower lash line if that
makes sense so now I'm taking this
little luck C 231 small tapered blending
and I am just smoking this out
completely
it looks really crazy tell you get your
you know mascara on but yeah I've got
orange eyes orange all right now I'm
taking the Tarte - Nicole concealer
powder brush picking up any sort of
excess and now let's go ahead you know
what I forgot to put a little eyeliner
on I'm gonna do white eyeliner today so
that it makes my eyes look a little more
open and big so I'm just putting this
right onto it literally just stabbed
myself that hurt
all right I'm just putting this right
onto the waterline just doing a few
passes oh I can never do that on
camera you know when like beauty gurus I
like I'm gonna do it off camera it's
because they're up and they
don't want to show you but I'm gonna let
you see me poking myself in the eye
all right my poor sad lips I don't even
want to put that liquid lipstick because
I feel like it's gonna look like
but we should try it anyway but anyway
let's move on to mascara I'm gonna take
this guy this is the Maybelline lash
discovery a mini brush mascara I have
only a small amount of this left so I'm
gonna finish that baby off won't
repurchase obviously since Maybelline
does tests on animals but I'm taking one
coat of that onto my lashes - I see all
these brow hairs here
I don't think I have actually gone ahead
and clipped my eyebrows clipped popped
my eyebrows for probably I want to say a
good two months I don't know what it is
but like my eyebrow hair just doesn't
grow very fast and it is kind of on the
blonde side probably can't tell right
now it look for good dark but yeah it's
a little bit on the blonde side so I
just don't have to do that but yeah one
coat of that and now I'm gonna go in
with one coat of the balm cosmetics and
Matt lash where's where is it the balm
cosmetics are recently sent me a really
a really beautiful PR package I think I
can't find it okay yes yeah the balm
cosmetics recently sent me a really
really nice TR package was like 20 of
their items which I totally did not see
coming but I do like the Matt lash I got
a sample of this like probably about
nine months ago in an Ipsy bag when I
was still subscribed to Ipsy and I think
it's really nice it's got kind of like
that rubber bristle wand it's got that
sort of little shape that goes lip and
it's really nice for holding a curl as
you guys can see I did not actually curl
my lashes which isn't smart but I don't
know my lash colors in the other room so
you know but yeah anyway just putting a
layer that on you're getting a little
clumpy which is my favorite thing ever
yeah so that's what we got so far and
then I guess I want to give you guys my
thoughts really quickly on the midnight
mermaid collection from wet and wild
let's put that liquid lipstick on but I
don't want to hear in the comments
about my lips okay because they are
super chapped I literally just had a
two-and-a-half-hour practice session but
let's go ahead and apply this this is
one of the metallic liquid lipsticks in
the shade oh you guys see that it's not
gonna go on we're not doing it forget it
we're good do you see them do you see
this see this is how chapped they are
okay I just want people to be able to
see that so they understand why things
look patchy on my lips because that's
how chapped they are all right we're
gonna we're gonna go ahead and skip the
metallic liquid lipstick but what I will
do
it's just kinda make sure they're
properly lined but that clearly it's not
gonna go on well but I do actually like
these liquid lipsticks so let me go
ahead and swatch it for you guys so the
midnight mermaid collection I actually
thought was a pretty good it was like a
success in my opinion and this is one of
the metallic liquid lipsticks in the
shade let's see here coral crown and
this one is really really beautiful like
I said I don't think anything is gonna
go on two of my lips and a nice
beautiful delicate way today just
because they're hella chat but I really
really like the metallic liquid
lipsticks I find them comfortable I find
that they do last the majority of the
day for someone who has really really
dry chapped e ass lips like me you
should probably go in with a lip liner
you guys know I'm just messy anyway when
I apply my lip product but yeah I would
recommend going in with a lip liner and
then here we have the wet and wild
metallic liquid eyes shadows these are
fantastic they remind me a lot of the
Stila
glitter and glow liquid eyeshadows this
particular shade right here is called
let's see here mysterious night so I
will go ahead and do those to watch for
you guys beautiful colors in this
collection these goes on so nicely like
I said very similar to the steel eye
glitter and glows I love the way that
these lasts all day long I like to just
kind of tap them onto the lid I'm not
the one who can take this I'm like blend
it up into my crease and like that
but they're nice on the lower lash line
they're nice and blended onto the lid
and then as far as the liquid eyeliners
are concerned this is a no-go for me and
I'm gonna end up decluttering these they
definitely stay on nicely but they're
metallic liquid liners I feel like
they're slightly chunky you really have
to build the color up this particular
shade right here is called C symmetry
and it's just a beautiful kind of
aquamarine a green color with a little
bit of a sheen going on but it's just
not something for me personally I would
recommend to you guys unless you are
fantastic with liner I mean I would use
this like on my lower lash line and
things like that
or even as base because like sometimes
I'll take a liquid liner and tap it on
as an actual base on my lid but these
guys I just really am NOT a fan of and
then finally the highlighter the
highlighter is so unique and beautiful
you have to be careful I don't think
this would work for all sorts of
different skin tones it looks like this
beautiful kind of goldish color with
like a you know it looks like an
opalescent white color with like a gold
shift to it it actually
like a blueish chef to it very creamy
very buttery and not technically like a
big Chalet it's a little more on the
powdery side but I'm telling you if you
are super super fair-complected with a
cool undertone this might not work for
you now right now I definitely do have a
little more color and I feel like it
works for me nicely but I can't go into
much with this because it just doesn't
work for me so anyway that is the swatch
of the highlighter I love it though if
you want something very unique in your
collection and you're looking for a
really really cool kind of highlighter
like that would definitely recommend so
I give this 4 out of 5 stars for sure I
definitely give these guys the cream
eyeshadows 5 out of 5 liquid lipsticks I
would say 3 out of 5 I mean clearly
nothing's going onto these lips today
and then these guys are in here 1 out of
5 so anyway guys I think that's pretty
much it and that is all of the new
makeup that I've been playing with
lately love the Becca lilac geode
shimmering skin perfecter such a unique
shade for about how to come out with
really would highly recommend you pick
this up it is not similar to rose quartz
if you guys want me to do a side-by-side
comparison of all my Becca shimmering
skin Perfector press let me know down
below try and get that video up for you
guys in the next couple of weeks and
they give me more highlighting palette I
definitely like but I feel like you need
specific brushes when it comes to this
guy it definitely looks very similar to
the what is it similar to lips literally
I just want to like peel all those dads
get off if you wear you know I put on
like a heavy duty lip balm it's just so
sad it's just so sad my lips are a mess
but anyway if you do um pick this up it
is very similar to the Nicole Guerrero
but this one is definitely more firmly
kind of pressed I still like it I don't
think I'll declutter it I like it the
color pop yes please pal obsessed with
us my friend sent me this thank you so
much for Annie this is amazing I love
this palette I think it's so beautiful
really really pretty on the eyes even if
you just don't have like a lot of skills
with makeup like I do I still feel like
it looks relatively good on the eyes and
then like I said the you know collection
here I'm really enjoying the midnight
mermaid collection these Smashbox a brow
pencil I don't know I need to play with
this more clearly it's funny because it
was so you know so it looked like it
would be very precise but it didn't look
too precise towards the front of my
brows I don't know maybe I need to do a
little bit of the tail as well
eventually but yeah that's pretty much
it so anyway I hope you guys
enjoy to this video as always thank you
for joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
