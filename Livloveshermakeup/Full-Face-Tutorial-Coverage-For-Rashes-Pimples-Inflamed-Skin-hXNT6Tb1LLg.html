have a tutorial on a full face of
foundation just the face part I have
been breaking out lately like crazy and
it was ever since MLS menstrual cycle
stopped so well it was during it and
then it just has been taking a long time
to clear up so um I thought this was
actually the perfect time to go ahead
and do a like flawless foundation
routine and I already have my hair clip
back with these little support lips and
let's just get started the first thing
I'm going to do is when I really really
want coverage instead of putting on a
primer I usually put on a CC cream as my
primer so this is the cover girl plus
all a CC cream tone rehab foundation
base so I'm just going to take one pump
of that and apply that all over my face
this is just gonna color correct and on
um it will cover some spots but it's not
going to be like amazing room by any
means it's not going to cover everything
but it sure makes a nice base when it
comes to having this flawless face
right so I just rub that in with my
fingers all the way the next thing I'm
going to do is um apply my foundation
the one I used when I really need good
coverage is the Revlon Colorstay whipped
my shade is 110 ivory and what I do is
just kind of get my finger in there and
dot it on my face in little spots this
cats are being crazy and we always
distract me Musa you anyway so um I'm
going to take my Real Techniques expert
face brush and blend that in
next I'm going to take this little angle
you can take any of these this one broke
off from the Pharaoh I'm and have to go
ahead or yep like the base of it I'm
going to have to go ahead and glue that
back on or find a way but I'm just going
to blend all of this into my hairline
and then I'm just going to Pat out areas
why I don't want the foundation to sink
in or set and this one is a little light
for me I got it like in the middle of
winter at last here so i am going to use
a powder now that will help to kind of
darken it up this is the Revlon nearly
naked powder I like this for when I do a
full coverage because I think it does
have a tiny bit of coverage and I like
that it's drugstore price so just going
to take that and Pat it on pack it on
and add it to my skin
and the reason i don't use concealer
when i'm feeling like a full foundation
routine like this is because i use that
CC cream which kind of acts as a you
know color corrector primer and
concealer so it's kind of a quick way to
cover up any blemishes that you might
have very quickly okay once i have said
it i am going to go ahead and take
another powder so this is kind of an
another reason why we didn't use
concealer this is the elf personal
blender foundation and i have it set on
the grinder they have like little
grinder pieces to the lighter shade and
i'm just going to go ahead and dot that
in there and then i'm going to tap it
off in the cap because you get a lot and
then i'm just going to work those over
my cheeks mainly where I've been having
um the breakouts and a piece car right
same thing on the other side and you can
see that that is covering pretty well so
then I just take the excess and just
work it all over do them on my forehead
oh I still have cold I can't believe
it's been weeks anyway so that has
really covered up the majority of
basically anything that you could see
I'm just going to make sure everything's
super super blended all right I'm going
to take a baby wipe wipe my neck my
hands and then line my lips quickly
okay so this is what our face looks like
it's nice because everything is covered
up nothing is too visible now what you
want to do is go ahead and put on you
know your blush and what I suggest is
when you are having breakouts is to go
with a matte blush shimmer can really
really accentuate like oiliness or just
like acne in general so you don't want
to emphasize any kind of texture on your
face so I'm going to be taking the mass
illamasqua blush in katy it's just this
nice cool toned pink it is completely
mad I'm just going to apply that with
one of these brushes any blush brush
will do put that right on the apples of
the cheeks it's just going to give some
color back to the face but also not draw
attention to any area because it is just
a completely matte color
oh gosh sorry guys really should have a
tissue box here okay so as you can see
that has not I mean it draws some
attention to the cheeks but it's mostly
just for color it's not because of oh
look how shiny your faces not like that
so anyway um this is the look this is my
full foundation routine um I wear this
when I'm breaking out these are probably
some of the worst breakouts I've had in
a while so um I'm just trying to be okay
with it just you know um kind of power
through it I guess you could say it's
hard when your skin is clear for a while
and then it just suddenly like goes
crazy so um my suggestions are to just
keep keep up with your skin care routine
don't change anything to dramatically
because that can be too much for your
skin um and it's definitely okay to
switch up to you know heavier coverage
foundation and you know like using a CC
cream as a primer that's okay you know
um and I think if it makes you feel you
know better about what's going on which
it does for me definitely um I thought
that you know this would be helpful for
you guys so anyway thank you so much for
watching this video please subscribe if
you want to be like on top of all my
videos that come out at once and I'll
see you guys in the next video fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
