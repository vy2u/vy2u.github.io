thank you so much for joining me i hope
you are all having a fantastic day as
always i am here to share a makeup
tutorial with you guys today I'm very
very excited this look consists of glowy
skin neutralize any bolds lip I have
been kind of gravitating towards this
look lately it's really really fast and
easy to complete in my opinion um I
think I can do it in under 15 minutes in
the morning it probably will take me
longer on camera because i'll be showing
you guys the products but it's just
really really pretty i think it looks
nice it's not too heavy on the skin it
looks very natural and feels really
natural on the skin and also i think
it's really really beautiful the pop of
color on the lip we're using the rim
bowl show off lip lacquer in Big Bang
which is a beautiful kind of red color
and I think it just really drop it in
and it's very very pretty and I just
think you look very well put together
with this look so I hope you guys enjoy
it let's just get right into it shall we
so the first couple of steps i have
already completed and that was basically
priming my face I used the benefits that
gal brightening face primer and I
applied that all over my face and then I
went in with my Smashbox photo finish
hydrating under eye primer and I tapped
this in underneath my eye and then I
went in with the bomb put a lid on it
eyelid primer and I obviously put this
on my eyelids so the next step is to go
ahead and do foundation and the
foundation that i will be using is the
l'oreal visible lift serum absolute with
programming all a plus vitamin c i have
the lid open here because the pump never
really works for me and the shade i'm in
is 143 soft ivory i believe that is the
lightest shade so what i'm going to do
is just take out a little bit of this
and put it on the back of my hand
don't you hate when pumps just stopped
working like all of a sudden it's like
wow you worked forever and ever and now
you don't anyway I'm just putting a
little bit of this on the back of my
hand I really really like this color
it's a really really nice match for my
skin tone so I'm taking about that much
on the back of my hand and I am going in
with my damp Beauty Blender and i'm just
going to tap that on the back of my hand
and start tapping that on to my face
this is a very very natural looking
foundation it really really looks like
skin i would say it is light to medium
coverage really really like it i think
it's a beautiful beautiful finish on the
skin
and as you guys can see it's not
necessarily covering any sort of spots I
may have um it is that kind of a month
for me so I do get these big hormonal
kind of pimples I guess you could say so
what we are going to do is go in and
conceal those however first we are going
to go ahead and conceal our under eye
area so what i will be using for that is
the instant age rewind erase your dark
circle treatment from maybelline in the
brightener shade it's got a pink
undertone it's absolutely beautiful and
i'm going to be taking that and doing
the triangle under to my eye all the way
down to my nose and up towards my
cheekbones and then i'm also going to
put this on my eyelid a little bit on my
chin down my nose and a little bit on my
forehead like that and then we are going
to go back into the Beauty Blender and
take it on the other side where we
haven't applied product yet on this side
and I'm just going to blend that in I
love this concealer you guys it is
really really fantastic absolutely
beautiful even if you have fair skin it
really is a beautiful beautiful color
match don't worry if it looks a little
too pink now we are going in with two
different powders to set this that will
even out the color all right next I'm
going to go ahead and cover some of
those bigger marks that I have from some
pimples and I am using the maybelline
superstay better skin corrector yeah
camouflage corrector or concealer plus
corrector it has octal see and its oil
for you have no idea what actual see is
but my shade is ivory and I'm just going
to be taking that and I'm just putting
this on the areas where I have some of
those bigger pimples so right there
they're just taking those right on those
areas all right there and then I'm going
to take the bottom of my beauty blender
which again we haven't applied any
product with that area yet so taking the
bottom and i'm just going to tap those
in and blend them in sorry i think i see
my arm up i am using my um Urban Decay
palette to see what I'm doing while I do
this look because I don't have a mirror
like in front of me in this area where i
put on my makeup is actually to the side
but i want to be in front of the window
so that you get better lighting um but
i'm going to have to like hang a mirror
somewhere over here are some things i
don't have to constantly be all they won
up alright so after we have blended
those in you guys can still see my skin
through this foundation and the
concealer and everything like that and
that's fun I mean it's it's not like it
looks bad it just looks very very
natural and I do like it hold on line my
lips and the next step is to go ahead
and we are going to set to that
foundation so the first powder that I'm
going to be using is the Revlon nearly
naked in 010 this is a little dark on my
skin but I'm going to be taking it with
my it cosmetics um boogie buffing brush
and I'm just going to go into that
product and tap it on to my skin I'm
just going to basically stipple it on
and you guys will see it is a little
dark for my skin but we will be going in
with another powder after this and we
are just setting in all of those
products that we just put on the case
I love this powder though it's a very
very fine milled or finely milled and it
just looks really really gorgeous and
natural on the skin it never looks cakey
like you can keep building this up
throughout the day and it still won't
look cakey which i think is fantastic
and amazing all right and then I'm going
to go in with my NYX blotting powder
this is in the shade be LP 01 light um
and I'm going to use the same a little
spooky buffing brush and I'm going to
tap over that just to kind of even out
the color because that fair shade from
Revlon is a little dark on my skin have
sad the lightest shade is too dark if
you are a pale girl you probably know
what that's like pero pale girl problem
and I'm just blending it down my neck a
little bit and into my hairline making
sure everything is blended all over the
place and that is basically the base for
this look let me wipe my lips again I'm
obsessed with doing this I don't know
what the deal is um but when I'm doing
my makeup I always I feel like I'm just
kind of sloppy like I throw the
foundation on so it always goes over my
lips but i'm just a very aware of my lip
area and so I'm obviously back to wipe
that I have to wipe it but anyway that
is the base for this makeup look let me
go ahead and wipe my neck a little bit
since that darker powder did get down
there a little bit all right next we are
going to go ahead and put some blush on
and the blush we are using is from hard
candy this is the glow all the way blush
in 994 punch it's a gorgeous gorgeous
iridescent beautiful pink color and it
goes into kind of like a silvery
highlight shade and I'm just going to
mix those together with this up and up
blush brush I got this from target it is
the target compared to brand and I'm
just going right into that product I'm
going to tap off the excess and then I'm
going to apply that to the apples of my
cheeks
you guys can already see we're starting
to get a little glow on the skin I feel
like a lot of people think that when
you're doing a glowy look or something
like that you have to use cream products
or you know like I don't know like cream
highlights or all that kind of stuff you
really don't you can build it up with
powder products and especially for me
especially when it is that time of the
month the last thing I want to be doing
with my face is putting a bunch of wet
products on like it has to be set in
because I get really really oily um this
time of the month so this is still a way
to achieve that glowy skin without um
piling on a bunch of cream products
alright guys so you can see that have a
nice little sheen to it and then we are
going to go in and build that up even
more and do our highlights so i will be
using the L'Oreal True Match Lumi
highlighters I did not like these
separately i don't like them on the skin
I just thought that the Rose one which
is this one it's n20 to Rose I thought
that it just didn't look very I don't
know wasn't very flattering on my skin
tone and it also just um was very very
powdery I didn't like it and then the
ice one I thought was way too cool and
it just looked really really strange on
my skin so what I have found is if i
combine the two of them I get a really
really nice like medium if that makes
sense like they meet in the middle and
it works so the first one I'm going to
use is the rows one and it looks like
this and I'm going to be taking my sigma
t / and highlighter what is this f-35
brush and I'm just going to swirl into
that product I'm going to tap off the
excess and then I'm going to go ahead
and put that on my chin just kind of
lightly dusting it I'm also going to put
it down my nose down the bridge with my
nose a little bit up here
and then some on my cheekbones as well
making sure I tap off the excess each
time because these products do build up
pretty quickly on the skin you guys can
probably see
select that and then I do like to go
back with my powder brush or the brush
that I used to set my foundation in with
the bookie buffing just tap over that to
make sure that there's not any sort of
texture going on I just really want to
make sure everything is set and then I'm
going to go into the ice shade which is
this one definitely a lot more cool in
tone doing the same thing definitely
tapping off that excess I'm going on a
chin again Finnegan down the bridge of
my nose a little bit up what is this
like middle of my eyebrow area
cheekbones kind of down to the apples of
my cheeks
and then again I am going to go ahead
and take that brush that I set my
foundation with and I'm just going to
tap over that to make sure it's not too
much because when you do to highlight
sometimes it can be a little much
alright so that is basically our dewy
skin what do you guys think I really
think it's pretty and I like the
combination of the two different
illuminators because this one's a little
more pink and this one's a little more
cool two of them combined I think are
really really pretty together alright
the next step have to wipe those lips
again guys the next step is going to be
our eyebrows and I am using my BH
Cosmetics HD brow pencil this has a
little spooley on one side and then the
pencil on the other oops that's the
pencil side so with this bully side I'm
just going to brush my eyebrows up like
that and then with the pencil sign I'm
just going to fill in the front part of
my brows I feel like that gives them a
nice amount of definition and I think
it's a very very pretty so I'm just
going to take that and fill in that
front area and then I'm going to brush
them out again like that and then twist
it around and brush them up again
all right those are the brows next we
are going to go in with our eyeliner i
will be using the laura geller icare
waterproof eyeliner in the brightener
shade or the banana shade and i'm going
to be putting this on my waterline
just like that to kind of open the eye
area up then we are going to go ahead
and go into the eyeshadows that we will
be using and I am using my physicians
formula mac collection quad I shadow in
classic nudes which looks like this and
I'm going to be taking that shade right
there with this BH Cosmetics fluffy
crease brush and I am just going to be
tapping that in tapping off the excess
and working that into my crease just
blending back and forth and doing some
circular motions just to get a little
depth in that area do the same on the
other eye
just like that and then I'm going to go
in with the elf what's easy self
professional eye crease brush it's a
very very densely packed little smudger
brush and I'm going in with that same
color and I'm getting going to be
packing that on my lower lash line just
to get a little more dimension
just like that and then I'm going to be
taking my best on me boudoir finishing
brush and running that underneath my
eyes to pick up any sort of fallout that
I may have had there's not a lot but
there is a little and then I'm going to
go ahead and curl my lashes you do about
10 seconds each I like to kind of pump
it like this just to really really get
that to hold a curl because my lashes
don't like to hold a girl what so ever
and then we are going to be combining
mascaras the first one we are going to
put down is the Lancome Hypnose drama in
excessive black and I'm just taking that
and I am going to put that just one coat
of that on my upper and lower lashes
and then we are going to be topping it
with another mascara which is one of my
favorites it's the outrageous curl from
Sephora it's their house brand I love
that mascara it's got a really nice
little tiny wand so that is our first
layer of mascara and then we will go in
with the Sephora one and that will just
bring you know it will just kind of open
up the eye area again it's like the
whole combination of the glowy skin and
neutral eyes I think the one thing that
stands out the most is going to be the
lips but the eyes are still pretty and
you can still see that there's some
definition there so then we're going to
go in with the Sephora outrageous curl
this is what to be wand looks like
really really cute and I'm just taking
that and applying one coat of that to my
lashes as well and this is just going to
thicken them up a bit like that
alright so there are the eyes um I did
get a little bit of product underneath
my lower lash line because I am super
messy when I apply my mascara but we're
going to let that sit and dry first
before I go in with a q-tip and just
kind of wipe it up so now we're going to
go on to the lips i'm going to
moisturize my lips first with the lip
smacker red velvet royal red velvet lip
smacker the smells so good and it's very
very moisturizing it has a little bit of
a red tint which is great because we
were using a red lip product and then
the star of the show or the one area of
the face that I feel like really really
pops out it to you when you see this
look we are using like I showed you at
the beginning the Rimmel London show-off
lip lacquer in big bang and I really
love this product because it stays
glossy on the lips which i think is
really beautiful so we are just going to
apply that to the lips
just like that and then I'm going to
take a tissue of course and go to make
sure none gets on my teeth okay and that
is the lip look I really really love the
lips I think that they it's just such a
nice like combination of the neutral
eyes and the glowy skin and then that
bright red lip can go wrong with the
bright red lip right so I really really
like this particular lip color too
because it does stay glossy on the lips
all day so really really beautiful then
we are going to go in with a q-tip and
pick up any of that mascara that got
underneath the lower lash line so it
should have dried by now so you can just
wipe it underneath and it will pick up
any sort of flicking you should just
take it right off when it's dry like
that I mean it should just like right
off all right and then the last step
with this particular makeup look is
going to be using a setting spray
particularly a dewy kind of setting
spray this is the tacho luminous dewy
skin mist and i'm just going to take
this and apply it all over my face and
there you have it guys this is the look
that i have been reaching for lately i
know this is kind of a long video 20
minutes but i swear you really can do
this under 15 minutes very very quickly
in the comfort of your own home but
anyway i hope you guys enjoyed this look
i will be posting a whole video later so
i hope you guys enjoy that as well and i
will see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
