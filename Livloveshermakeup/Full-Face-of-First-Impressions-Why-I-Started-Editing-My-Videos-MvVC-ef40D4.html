today I have a full face of first
impressions video to share with you guys
now and this is sort of I get ready with
me but it's not like my typical really
long one take it get ready with me super
chatty of videos now there will be parts
of this video where I fast forward and
one of the reasons for that is just
because I've recently gotten into
editing my videos it has a lot of you
can tell the majority of us seem to love
it but there are I was in it's like a
15% of you they're like really pissed
that I'm editing videos and I thought
maybe it would be a good time now to sit
down and kind of let you guys know why I
started to edit video so I think a lot
of people do think that I do not take
constructive criticism I believe I do
take constructive criticism and when it
came to editing my videos a lot of
people were asking for it and I started
to do it now I don't edit every single
one of my videos if you watch my fails
and holy grails are usually still one
take sometimes I will have multiple
videos during the week that are one take
but another part of the editing is that
I became a little uninspired with this
channel don't get me wrong I have shit
tons of ideas and it is easier to film
these kind of videos than it is to film
like a mystery video or something that I
put a little more effort into like all
my other channels one of the reasons why
I went ahead and opened up those other
channels was because this started to
feel boring to me there is only so much
happiness that makeup can bring me
personally this is not what I want to do
for a living I am NOT a makeup artist
and I'm just trying to be a hundred
percent real with you guys I needed
something to switch up my filming style
so a lot of it did come from a place of
boredom as well and editing is a
challenge I like a good challenge so I'm
really sorry if you don't like it the
editing in videos now but it's something
that makes me happy it's something that
makes the majority of you happy and I'm
going to continue to do it so anyway I
wanted to have a little chat real
quickly but let's go ahead and jump into
the video if you want to see the full
face of first impressions then please
keep on watching starting with the
Ordinaries hyatt here in silicone primer
it says high adherence blurring surface
smoother and primer and I'm going to
apply that all over my face
oh it's whistling alright so that
what it looks like it just kind of looks
like a moisturizer but it definitely
feels thick now it doesn't feel super
slippery like a normal sort of silicon
based primer and feels kind of thick has
an interesting smell it feels kind of
thick like it's moisturizing but at the
same time it's got the silicone in there
so that's kind of interesting by the way
if you guys are curious I did already do
my skincare I kinda moisturize there did
all that stuff so I'm just going ahead
and blending as if in two of my skin
it's really like I don't want to say
thick like the Porefessional but it's
thick like half moisturizer half
blurring primer that's what I will say
about this guy right here
alright now as far as eye primer is
concerned I don't have anything that's
like brand new that's a first
impressions but recently in my haul on
Tuesday I did pick up another another
another another Milani eyeshadow primer
so I'm just gonna go ahead and use that
as my eye primer because it is new it's
not like a new to me product but this
bottle is new so I'm just gonna take a
little bit of that and I'm just gonna
tap that all over my eyelids and then
the residual
I do take down underneath my eyes
because I do take shadow down there and
I do find that I've shadow primers that
do help as well under the eyes if you're
going to be popping concealer on which
we are today recently I haven't been
wearing a lot of concealer if you've
been seen in my videos a lot of people
have been saying oh your skin looks so
fresh it's funny I haven't been wearing
concealer I've only been wearing like a
CC cream or like a foundation I don't
know I just like taking foundations
around my eye area as long as they don't
irritate me you know so anyway just
patting that on alright now we're gonna
go ahead and jump in a Q concealer now
the concealer that I am going to be
reaching for today is the Urban Decay
all nighter concealer this was recently
sent to me by my friend Samantha and the
shade that I have is fair warm now I'm
really worried that this is going to be
way way way too light on me so what I'm
going to do is actually put concealer on
first and then go in with my foundation
normally I do
the other way around but that's just how
we're gonna do it today so let's go
ahead and apply this is what it looks
like and I'm just gonna go ahead and put
this underneath my eyes I don't have a
ton of spot concealing to do and lately
I just haven't wearing I haven't been
wearing a ton of concealer like I said
sorry it's Saturday it's like I feel
like when I sleep in really late on
Saturdays I just I can't speak like I
wake up and I sleep in but for some
reason like the extra sleeping it makes
me even more tired so I'm fumbling over
my words do you know why I'm so yeah I'm
just gonna take a little bit like that
and I'm gonna go directly in with my
sponge cuz I've heard that just does dry
pretty quickly and as you guys can see
this is too late for me I did self tan a
couple of days ago by the way I'm
blending it in with a damp miracle
complexion sponge from Real Techniques I
did go ahead and actually self tan the
other day however last night I don't
know what was up but I decided to go
ahead and remove that self tan with a
scrub I guess I wasn't really thinking
about it I just thought that my body
needed some exfoliation so I used to
scrub and is why I don't really have a
tan left but even so without the tan I
mean this still is really really light
so I would probably use a darker shade
or I will mix this together with other
concealers that are a bit too dark for
me but that looks really really nice I
was a little worried about this because
I heard that it can it be a little
drying underneath the under eye I do
have dry skin right now but I think
that's all I'm gonna use I don't want to
go in too much with it plus I don't wear
a lot of concealer I don't do the
triangle thing or anything like that so
I'm just gonna jump into foundation now
so I have it cosmetics bye bye lines
foundation here I was gonna save this
for a first impressions foundation
Friday video but we're not gonna do that
today I have a light and I do believe
that this is gonna be too dark for me so
I'm gonna take a couple drops of the
next total control cover drops in the
shade pale and I'm just gonna add that
directly to the sponge as well normally
I do like to take the product and just
like display it on my face first like I
said can't talk today I actually put it
on my face first and then I will blend
it in
with a sponge but this one seems to have
a really interesting kind of consistency
so I'm just gonna go ahead and put it
directly onto the sponge and then put it
on two of my skin
so hopefully mixed together with that
NYX product this will first of all give
it maybe just a tad more coverage but
also it will help lighten it up to what
my shade because this is a bit too dark
like I said I don't know what got into
me last night but I was like I really
need to do a body scrub like I have not
used a body scrub for a while and then
it just took all my tan off with it I
just I forgot I forgot so I'm just
blending this in again with the miracle
complexion sponge this is very pretty on
the skin wow it's got really really nice
glow to it I feel like if you have dry
skin this is gonna be something they go
probably it's like or probably want to
look into a very very nice you guys see
that it's got this lovely glow to it
even with the total control cover drops
added in now I will go ahead and test
this out I'm gonna take a little bit
around my eye area because my face looks
glossy but my eyes look kind of matte
because of that concealer now I will go
ahead and continue to test out this
foundation on its own after I do
self-tan again to see what it looks like
sometimes the next drops can add in a
little more coverage but this looks
beautiful I really really like the look
of that I got the foundation on I think
it looks beautiful especially mixed
together with those NYX drops so that is
a nice little pairing right there I'm
gonna go ahead and set my face now as I
usually do with my ELF tone correcting
powder and cool and then I do have more
of like a silica based powder that will
be a first impressions for me that we
will jump into as well so there is the
elf tone correcting powder and cool I
get asked a lot how I use this so I will
be using up my Ecotools kabuki brush and
I like to go ahead and stipple this all
over my face I still do this even with
my dry skin which I know surprises a lot
of people but especially with the tone
correcting powder because it is so
finely milled I do not have any sort of
issues so I'm just going ahead and
stippling that all over including my eye
area as well so that I can set in that
concealer and then all over my cheeks
now obviously this is going to change
the finish of the foundation a little
bit
this is gonna make it look a little more
matte but I still think it looks really
really pretty when I look up close I
think it looks nice my under eye looks a
little piggy I was kind of worried about
that concealer I wasn't initially going
to pick it up and then Samantha was like
hey I got a Fiat package from Urban
Decay you want me to send you one and I
was like sure I guess I'll try it out
but I do not know if this is going to be
the best if you do have a dry skin and
just a little bit of a warning get my
ears out here so I can go ahead and
blend this yeah all right and then like
I said I do have a finishing powder that
I do want to test out but this is from
rms beauty my friend recently sent this
to me it's called the unbound and it's
supposed to be just like a silica based
kind of primer
I mean powder so I'm gonna take the
little seal off here and I'm just gonna
put a little bit into the cap like tap
it in there and then I will go in with
this brush right here this is from ELF
it is called and be a flawless face
brush I thought I would just go ahead
and kind of apply this lightly all over
my skin just as a little bit of a
finishing powder you could also use this
doing like the buffing technique where
you go in with your blush and your
bronzer and all that kind of stuff and
then after you make sure you go in with
like a kabuki brush and really buff it
into the skin but just for today we're
just gonna go like this so that's pretty
typical kind of finishing powder I don't
have super high expectations for this I
don't know what the RMS line is like
when it comes to and you have their
products and I actually have no idea
what their price range is like but this
looks pretty illness good all right guys
now we're gonna go ahead and jump into
the anasazi abauerly Hills contour
palette I was recently sent to me it by
a friend as well so let's go ahead and
chisel out those cheekbones a little bit
I'm gonna take that middle shade at the
bottom with a morphe angled brush like
this yeah I'm just gonna dip in there
and lightly chisel up my cheekbones I'm
not much of like a full-on kind of
contouring girl but nothing wrong with
the light little chisel and then I will
also do a little bit around my hairline
and when I contour I know they always
say don't take it too far down here but
I would
so like I have pretty big cheeks oh I do
alright and then I'm gonna take that
same sort of shade and I'm just gonna go
lightly around my hairline up here just
giving a little more color to my skin
because I feel like after all that
foundation was possibly a little on the
light side well when I mixed it together
with the next product so just going
around my hairline like that and then I
always like to go in with a big fluffy
brush this is from Tarte from the
treasured tools a brush set and I just
like to kind of stipple over that to
make sure it's not like too harsh on the
skin because knowing me it always looks
a little harsh it's not great at
blending all right for a blush guide
they don't have anything that's going to
be a first impressions but I'm gonna
jump in it to the illamasqua powder
blusher in the shade Naked Rose actually
before we do that why don't we go back
into the UH Nastasia Beverly Hills I'm
gonna take that light cream color shade
and I feel like I should kind of set my
under eye a little bit baby so let me
see I have this little tart brush here
as well I'm just gonna go into there
these seemed really really silky and
nice so I'm just gonna go ahead and go
right underneath my eye I did already
kind of set in that area but because
it's already looking like it's creasing
a little bit from the concealer I'm just
gonna double-check and kind of tap that
in just in case I had a bad feeling
about that concealer and very happy that
Samantha sent it's because I definitely
wanted to try it out but after seeing AJ
kissa and like a bunch of people review
it I was kind of worried that it was
gonna be a little too drying for me so
we shall see so anyway alright that
looks fine um these are very powdery but
still really nice on the skin I don't
see anything wrong with them like I said
I don't do anything too harsh when it
comes to contouring in the first place
anyway alright now let's go ahead and
jump into the Illamasqua Naked Rose
blush I'm taking this up and up a blush
brush and I'm just gonna tap in there so
they matte blush I'm gonna tap off the
excess and then put that right on to the
apples of my cheeks and take it up
towards my cheekbones very very neutral
sort of blush and I thought it would
just pair together and play nicely with
the other products that I want to try
out today
alright now let's go ahead and jump into
this highlighter this is from Oprah now
Oprah recently sent over the whole
entire nikkietutorials collection for
review so this is the what is it called
ever glow of highlighter it's a 3 Way
highlighter a little through song so I'm
gonna dip into the lighter champagne and
the white color mix those together with
my Alexi 5:22 tapered highlighter brush
so I'm just gonna swirl in there I know
what these highlighters are like they're
very very powdery because I do own Rodeo
Drive whoa baby I do own Rodeo Drive as
well as blissful but look how beautiful
on this skin I mean look at that glow
Jesus so I'm just taking that lately on
the chin and on the nose I'm gonna take
a little bit up here as well but whoo
that's a little so little I'm looking a
little Tin Man on the cheek so I'm gonna
jump back into that fluffy tart brush
and just kind of blend out totally okay
and now let's go ahead and move in a to
brows I'm gonna use my Smashbox brow
tech to go because I don't have any new
brow product to try out and I'm just
gonna fill them in quickly I will keep
you guys on camera but I'm going to
fast-forward through this
so if you can probably tell ended up
being a little bit of a yucky brow day
today they look quite dark and then here
they're a little uneven but I honestly
just don't care enough to actually go in
and redo them so I'm not gonna redo them
but we're just gonna jump right into the
Kat Von D and metal matte palette now so
I haven't even swatched any of these but
I think we're gonna start with the shade
bone which is one of the mattes at the
bottom and I'm gonna pick that up with
my BH Cosmetics fluffy crease brush I'm
just gonna dip into that product I'm
gonna tap off the excess and I'm gonna
go ahead and work that from my lid all
the way up to my brow and then it may
take a little bit of that color
underneath my eye as well it's pretty
white but honestly this concealer is
looking like shit underneath my eyes
unfortunately it just looks really
creepy and kind of crusty looking
creasing dry all that all that good
stuff so I feel like if I put a nice
kind of solid color underneath that
might help just a little bit it's
looking especially patchy over here as
well watching the footage back I noticed
that I missed a little Bluff of primer
over here but then I just blend it in
when I blend in my foundation so I think
it's from the primer pretty sure it's
from the concealer alright next up I'm
going to jump into the shade suede which
is that one right there taking the same
sort of brush I'm just gonna dip in
there and I am going to go ahead and
work this into my crease as my
transition I'm also taking it onto my
lid and I'm just going back and forth
and messily placing this into the crease
and above kind of blending up towards my
brow so that we have a nice sort of base
color I've heard good things but also
not so good things about this palette so
we'll see we'll see how it goes with me
um you guys know I'm no cleanup blending
or anything but I know Jay kissa doesn't
like and I know quite a few people don't
but I think these are blending pretty
nicely so far for Kat Von D matte
shadows sometimes Kat Von D matte
shadows don't blend as nicely as I would
like so anyway I'm just building up that
shade suede and like I said I blend it
all the way up sort of towards the brow
I do have downward pointing eyes so
anything I can take to kind of pull my
eye up like that will be helpful moving
on I'm gonna take a crease color and
apply that with this Coastal Scents
brush right here and I'm just gonna tap
it into my outer V so what I'm gonna
take of
for that shade is I think I'll take oak
which is this guy right here it's kind
of like that medium tone to brown shade
so this basically will just pop it right
on to the outer part of the lid and then
I will blend it out so I'm just tapping
it on and then going right into the
crease right here and I'm just kind of
depositing the color and then like I
said we will blend it with another brush
so so far I think these are going on
pretty nice they're very very pigmented
which is pretty typical for Kat Von D
mattes
but sometimes Kapton be mattes I find I
have a hard time blending them and then
the metal crush I never have an issue
with those they're beautiful I just
can't really work them into the crease I
know so many people have been telling me
you know you can't work shimmers in
disagrees why would you say something
like that is possible I know it's
possible I'm saying for me I'm just not
as good as working them into the crease
and things like that I prefer them for
the lid as well as lower lash line so
I'm just depositing that color like I
said now let's go ahead and blend that
in I'm just gonna take a morphe m5 13
and I'm just gonna go back and forth in
the crease and we will blend this out
I'm keeping it in the crease instead of
going above the crease I usually like to
use a really fluffy brush for that so I
can diffuse the color all right guys now
I want to go into a velvet which is one
of the overlapping shades from the
original Metal Max this is a little more
of a difficult color to work with but I
just want to try it so I'm gonna take
this other Coastal Scents kind of pencil
brush here I'm gonna dip in two velvet
and then I am going to again go ahead
and kind of tap that into the outer V
just so we can get a little more
definition and then I will blend again
in the crease with a little more like a
densely packed blending Brown is taking
a while to blend these shadows normally
I would probably be done with my eye
look depending on what palette I use I'm
just one of those people that doesn't
like to spend too much time but I really
want to put some effort in here so that
we can see how these really look and I
don't really have anywhere to go it's
Saturday
it's not like I'm getting ready for work
or anything but I can see that the
darker the shade the harder it is to
blend that suede shade which was the
transition blended beautifully
oak blended nicely but still was maybe a
little patchy and then velvet here is
pretty hard to blend but we're just
gonna continue on I feel like if you put
the time in the effort in you'll be able
to make it work that is the same for the
Kat Von D metal match the original if
you have those matte shades you know
that you do have to put a little more
effort into them as well I feel that way
about all Kat Von D mattes actually
they're just a little more firmly press
and I never felt like they blended like
a dream all right now I'm gonna jump
into suede again which was our
transition shade and I'm gonna take that
same brush and this time we're gonna go
a little higher so right here and I'm
gonna go ahead and start pulling up that
purple in that darker shade more towards
my brow like I said I have downward
pointing eyes so anything that's going
to lift I want it to do and I don't want
there to be like a dark line right there
so again kind of taking it above the
crease right onto the brow bone so that
we have a little more of a diffuse kind
of look going on here and then I will go
down onto my lid as well we're gonna go
ahead and go into the Tarte palette the
finger oil paints and pack a shadow onto
the lid but I really wanted to use the
mattes in here because that's what I've
been hearing people are having the most
trouble with and I already know that the
metal crush formula is pretty fantastic
so and I did look at the ingredients
list they look pretty similar so we'll
see to the original ones or the
full-size that I have so I'm not worried
about those I just really wanted to see
what the mattes were like when it came
to this palette so for the lower lash
line I'm gonna jump into the foil finger
paints a shadow palette from tarts I
want to take it that burgundy shade
right there that maroon kind of color
and I'm gonna jump in with a sigma you
know what no I should probably take it
yeah I'll take a sigma e30 pencil brush
I'm actually gonna spray this down with
a little bit of the Milani and make it
last setting spray so I will pick up the
foiled shadow first I have heard that
these can have a little bit of fallout
if you don't spray them down so I'm just
gonna spray that down very lightly and
then we will work this onto the outer
part of my lower lash line whoa okay
very pigmented a very a very a pigmented
so I'm just gonna take it like this I
don't remember who said that you need to
foil these but I kind of feel like maybe
Ito that's okay though
so I'm just taking it like this and then
I'm gonna go like that okay that looks
like a really harsh line so let me jump
in with my Sigma blending 825 and let's
just kind of see if we can blend that
out a little bit very pretty color
though I lit up a good like maroon on
the lower lash line and lately I've only
been taking it down halfway I feel like
they went on very pigmented so it's kind
of hard to show you with this but when I
blend I feel like I take a little bit of
excess over instead of having like a
harsh line right there I still like to
do that with my black eyeliner which I
know so many of you seem to think I'm
not aware of what my black eyeliner
looks like I am I do it that way on
purpose I like it but anyway I'm just
gonna go ahead and continue to kind of
blend that now I am getting the
teensiest amount of fallout so I'm gonna
jump in with this spare brush that I
have this is a wet and wild unicorn
brush and I'm just running underneath my
eyes really quickly now I think we
should go back to a little bit of
blending in the crease so and now that I
kind of know what I want for the lower
lash line I'm actually really happy with
that foil finger paints those beautiful
maroon kind of color and that particular
shadow swatched out the worst so I have
good feelings about the other ones in
here I know they also have glitter
Stoppers but I have another eye shadow
single from touch of glam Beauty that I
want to tap on so I will continue to
play with those and then when I do what
might follow up which will be I think
next Thursday I'm doing a Sephora haul
follow up as well as the drugstore haul
follow up I'll let you guys know how
they perform so now let's go ahead and
jump into a morphe m44 one and again I'm
going back into the cap on the metal
matte and taking the suede and I just
feel like I need to do a little more
blending here so I'm taking that
directly into the crease and I'm just
going back and forth I just want to make
sure we don't have shit tons of harsh
lines I will say
Mattson here are a little I mean I I
feel like I'm doing a lot of blending at
least there's a lot of blending for me
so yeah easily taking about five minutes
on each I whereas for me I would rather
have five minutes for each I that's just
well I would rather do but because it is
the weekend doesn't really matter I have
the time it's not like I'm in a hurry
like I have usually in the morning
before work but I'm just going back and
forth just making sure everything is
properly blended and then I'm gonna do a
little bit underneath the lash line as
well so that everything isn't too bad so
for the mattes yeah they're a little
hard to blend not gonna lie um now let's
go ahead and tap into one of the foil
finger paints on my lid I'm gonna take
the shade right here which is just this
beautiful beautiful kind of champagne
color and I'm just gonna go ahead and
put that directly onto my lid holy crap
that is stunning look at that look at
that color really really beautiful and I
just I thought this was gonna pair
beautifully with the kat von d palette I
just had a good feeling these feel a
little more textured than the metal
crush shadows and like I said I did
compare the formula here and I will go
ahead and do a swatch that feels like
the typical metal crush sort of formula
to me this guy right here is called a
thunderstruck pretty pretty pretty color
but yeah let's continue to kind of go
ahead and put that on it to Anna lid
from the foil finger paints shadow
palette very pretty maybe getting a
little bit of fallout but you definitely
don't need to foil you can just tap this
on with your finger which I think was
the point of the foil finger paints
shadow palette I've got a little bit in
my crease I hate when that happens
cuz then I have a shimmery crease which
I don't love but yeah that's very very
pretty I like the way that looks that's
nice so I'm gonna jump in let me take
this little Sigma brush right here this
is called a Sigma e30 6 I'm just gonna
make sure I can get that shimmer out of
the way right there but overall I like
that I like that on the lid and now I do
want to go in like I said with the touch
of glam Beauty tail of a mermaid i've
swatched this before it's supposed to be
a highlighter but i feel like it has too
much glitter in it for me to be like a
true high
so I'm just gonna tap that on top for a
little bit of extra oomph and also for a
little bit of a lavender hue I'm just
kind of feeling that today I think that
would be pretty nice it's kind of like a
lavender color with a little bit of a
gold Sheen being a little bit of fallout
with this one but that's okay nice nice
nice I love that I love the mixture of
the really really shiny lid with a
pretty matte crease and again I'm gonna
go into that tiny little Sigma brush and
I just like to run it through the crease
so that any sort of shimmer can be kind
of taken away okay cool let me pick up
some fallout because I felt some from
the touch of glam single so I'm just
gonna go underneath my eye like I said
this is a highlighter slash eyeshadow so
you can also use it as a highlighter but
it's got too much glitter in it for me
dr. Gwen Beauty is an indie brand by the
way if you guys are curious it looks
like I nicked the shadow by accident
oopsie-doopsie so anyway very pretty
alright let's go ahead and jump into
eyeliner now because why not I think
we're pretty good with the eyes I really
really like the foil finger paint
palette so far I think that's really
nice they also have these two glitter
shades right here why don't I take that
lighter one I'm it's kind of like a
white color and I'm just gonna tap that
on top too because why the hell not if
we're going all out we're going all out
right okay that's a little messy it's
funny it's almost like this spongy sort
of consistency slash texture but hey
we're layering a ton of stuff on the lid
it almost looks like I have like a steal
a glare and glow on my leg now great for
eyeliner one of my friends recently sent
me this I think she got it in her boxy
charm it's the beauty for real eyeline
24/7 eyeliner in platinum blonde
literally I thought this was gonna be
marked like a gold color but it
literally is kind of platinum now
because we already have a really shiny
lid I figured what the hell if this is
pigmented enough might as well put it on
to the waterline but I'm not seeing a
lot of pigment here this is probably
something you want to use on your lower
lash line or maybe to do like a wing or
something of course I don't do is there
anything like that so that was pretty
pointless and useless I just think it's
not about eyeliner I just think it's not
really for the intended purpose
that I wanted alright let's jump into a
coat of the mad lash mascara from the
balm cosmetics I don't currently have
any sort of nuit mascara to test out so
we're just gonna do this one I love this
mascara it's beautiful the balm
cosmetics did send this to me I want to
do a best and worst of BOM cosmetics
because I have so many products that
I've tried from them over the years and
then recently they did send me a lot of
products as well wow my eyes are
starting to water am i scared that I
mean I fucking poked myself in the eye
possibly possibly possibly possibly and
that actually is not enough for me so
I'm gonna go ahead and do one more layer
of the balm cosmetics mascara this time
I'm going to look down into my own
mirror so I can see what I'm doing
oh yeah I like the way that eyeshadow
turned out some of those shimmery shades
are creeping up into my crease a little
bit that could just be because I tapped
it on with my finger but that's just the
way that I like to do that so we'll see
how it wears her out the day I will
update you guys like I said when I do my
follow-up haul next week oh I got my
fucking eyeball motherfucker all right
here we go alright so that is what do
the eyes look like I'm pretty happy you
guys I mean I think the eyes watering
bitch what was I gonna say oh yeah pick
up auntie metal mat mini I don't think
the mats are horrible I mean if I can
blend and you can blend them honey okay
but I'm excited to work with some of the
shimmers and like I said I'll keep you
updated on that
now something I do want to do is jump
into the other over a lip product here
now this is from the nikkietutorials
collection like I said they sent that
over for PR so let me put on this new
two potion liquid lipstick oh it smells
really good
no I'm not really this kind of color
girl I don't really like this nudie
nudie light pink thing going on but
that's okay we're gonna top it with me
Becca what is this called liquid crystal
lip topper in the shade of champagne
dream flashes benigni
this is the first impressions for sure
I've not tried this out I do like Oprah
liquid lipsticks
so I'm just gonna take this and put that
on probably should've waited for the new
potion to dry but it dried pretty
quickly this really smells like suntan
lotion I know a lot of you are telling
me like you returned yours
because you can't stand the smell it's
not something that I feel like is gonna
bother me but kind of a stranger set
alright pisses me off so it moved it
liquid lipstick a little bit I'm sorry I
just didn't really wait for it to dry
never wait for things to dry but we'll
see how it goes throughout the day I
think this would be really pretty on its
own this is not really my kind of color
but we'll see if I can pair it together
with something else and finally let's
just do a little spray a little spritz
of the Milani make it last setting spray
and then we will be done because mama is
getting anxious I want to get up and
move my body what can I say ADHD
normally I stand when I do my makeup in
the morning right now I'm sitting and
I'm like so that is pretty much it guys
um I like the look I think everything
went on rather nicely I do not like the
concealer it was not the fan I've got
eyeliner but again I don't feel like
it's really intended for the use I
wanted to you know use it for so I'm not
going to talk too much about that um the
lip gloss I can still taste it I don't
really like the taste of that I don't
know if this is worth 30 dollars but for
15 I think it is this is actually
prettier than I thought it was I just
feel like because I'm wearing red today
maybe the light nude looks a little
strange but loving the eye look I
especially love that Tarte foil finger
paints a shadow palette I think this is
gorgeous what kind of highly recommend
you look into that as far as the Kat Von
D metal matte mini I will be traveling
with this I still think it's nice you
just need to put a little more time and
effort into it I love to the foundation
especially her together with the next
total control covered drops and then the
concealer like I said not a fan of a
concealer so yeah that's pretty much it
I hope you guys enjoyed this video

see you tomorrow from a fast</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
