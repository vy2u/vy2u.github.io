Channel today and you have a Q&amp;amp;A for you
guys going to be Q&amp;amp;A number five as well
as a little bit of a gift I'm ready with
me I'm obviously still in hawaii I got
Ruby pretty nose members today can you
make me miss this is pretty darn bad
yeah I got some number and i thought i
would go ahead and get them ready with
you guys show you guys what I'm going to
use on my skin to help kind of cool and
calm it down but yeah I own the ones go
ahead and answer questions while I see
with I am building this on my laptop
they're really just is an 80 good camera
to film with a while I'm gone honestly I
film daddy room tour on my phone and
believe this one on the laptop like I
said cuz I want to have a big questions
pulled up right next to me as well as
just be able to like I know I kind of
show up like completely in frame is very
hard to subscribe but my new camera is
kind of frightening it really zoomed in
on my face so I do plan on playing with
that and working with it when I get home
but for now i would go ahead and do a
verita next kind of get ready with me
and also i'm sorry it was me and if you
a so anyway look ahead and jump right
into it i have already taken off all of
these sunscreen i was wearing earlier
and things like that so the first thing
I wanted you is take this torch of
friction stick this is just a really
otherwise even doing this no auto focus
but this is basically just an
exfoliating cleanser and I am going to
go ahead and apply this on to my actual
space now you can apply this on to dry
skin or on wet skin if I really really
want a nice exfoliation I like to put it
on dry skin if I want just a little bit
of exfoliation I will go ahead and put
it on it damn skin but I'm just going
that all over and then I'm going to take
a washcloth 8pm washcloth and I'm with a
massage in circular emotions to kind of
get this cleanser going and really make
sure that it does exfoliated my face so
go ahead and jump into the Q&amp;amp;A you guys
like i said i have done quite a few of
these so if I cannot answer your
question may be asked on Instagram I
will you know link those videos down
below because they probably have already
been answered alright so the first
question comes from Emily II being and
she said what are your recommendations
were clearing up acne and what is your
all kind of favorite and makeup brand so
I
the latter my all-time favorite makeup
brand is a two-faced I've been having a
little bit of a hard time with you face
lately but they are my all time favorite
and make a brand and as far as
recommendations for clearing up acne are
concerned I do think that there are just
some ingredients that you should look at
you the first one at being retinol
uniting the retinol is one of those
products that is just used for
anti-aging it is not it is one of those
products that also is really great or I
should say retin-a is really really
great for clearing up acne benzoyl
peroxide is also fantastic and so it
sells dilek acid if you went really
really big kind of painful hormonal
pimples I get those along my jawline and
absentee relations you probably want to
go with benzoyl peroxides it's because
it's written and knock on in the app but
if you want interview people like if you
have skin if it does have tiny little
brain melts like those little
superficial under the skin of sort of
bumps i think salicylic acid would be
great so that's kind of my
recommendation is looking into those
kind of ingredients alright the second
question it comes from let's be here
Vanessa be and he asked would you do a
boyfriend does my voice over challenge
so a lot of you have been asking mrs.
Tom obviously doesn't want to come on
Cameron he's just not ready yet but yeah
I asked him and he said I don't know
thank you so we'll see about that i'm
not quite sure i'm leaving more towards
probably lost but if we ever have time
don't we decide to someone i obviously
will get that up for you guys alright so
this is kind of as you guys can see um
you know make my face a little bit red
it is an exfoliating cleanser so what
i'm going to do is just go ahead and try
my face Oh publicly carry pat dry my
face it just feel super super nice and
clean now I can see this is kind of a
cool product I just don't like it the
back end of the packaging because it's
compact but at the same time I don't
because the actual stick does get kind
of yet but this does have charcoal in it
and if you are back to the first
question if you are someone who those
deals with brighthouse i would highly
recommend looking into charcoal as well
alright so speaking of charcoal I am
going to go 80 with a math this is the
origins clear improvement active
charcoal mask and I'm just going to
apply a little bit of this mostly
concentrating in my cheese zone and not
so much around the areas where I'm super
super sunburned
I have been wearing a lot of sunscreen
so come free no matter what makes me
very valid like even the new one that I
got you guys can do to Xena want it
makes me break out so I like to always
have some sort of a map that will adjust
my cords when I travel and I am using a
lot of different so just kind of putting
that in my t-zone and then I will let
that sit for a few minutes but yeah ok
Vanessa our guest the answer is Vanessa
questions of yeah maybe about the deep
voice vs my voice over we'll see and I'm
definitely probably not you guys don't
be very very busy and outs of you just a
little camera-shy and that's okay all
right number three is from JM see if you
look at your own brand what we use you
makeup jewelry skin care or clothing I
think I'm used to being care you guys I
absolutely love love love skin care see
ya I'm happy to look in here the next
one is from a nursery crime and they
asked what's the most difficult thing
about being easy to eat youtuber so what
the most difficult thing is just having
to sometimes to deal with other beauty
youtuber I know that sounds absolutely
horrible but it was a very very kind of
competitive place and when you start
kind of making friends or making like
connections in the YouTube world you
start to notice that not everybody is
super nice so I would say that's really
difficult other than that I feel like
filming is quite easy for me personally
obviously I don't add it or anything so
sewing is good and easy for me I just
really enjoyed being on YouTube I really
like making the videos that I make and
yeah I think that's probably the most
difficult thing the second one means
typing in the description box that is a
pain in the ass alright the next
question is from Jessica Reimer how do
you get you to be professional world of
music so I think that we got into it
because I was raised surrounded so my
mom was a viola she did get her Bachelor
of music degree like I did and she
actually turned out to be a ballerina in
the end to completely switched her field
because she can do stuff like now she's
awesome but yeah I feel like I would
just kind of grew up around it so you
definitely make connections and I feel
like the majority of my connections are
in New York and outs of Minneapolis
obviously I grew up in Minneapolis went
to college in New York and a
feel like when you are in the
professional world you just kind of make
sure you have those connections that you
can reach out to people so yeah alright
the next one is from a BK Roth how did
you meet com I've talked about this
before we met on eharmony I rate the
next one is from Aliyev NZ what are your
favorite cruelty-free and non cool t3
and makeup brushes so i would say
cruelty-free probably be cosmetics i
really like their brushes most of them
are vegan I don't think all of them are
by the way I just want to wash off the
damn planet that I've used for a
charcoal exfoliating cleanser I'm going
to use this to remove this mask now I'm
not leaving an on my skin for too long
just because I have been a little red in
the face obviously and you know charcoal
can be a little it really cool things
out so I don't want to be too rough in
the areas where I'm a little more red so
anyway I'm just tended to be that in
circular motions the Black Pearl
cooperate so will be freed definitely
like I said probably bh cosmetics I also
really like Lux feat brushes one thing
is really kind of taken off recently I
feel like first to the sigma than it was
more fee now it's lucky but I should
like let's do a head stand by their
brothers I think they're actually really
really fantastic and yeah I'm really
reaching out to me a few months ago and
asked me if I wanted to try some of
their brushes out of it at the time I
didn't what the brand was actually and I
decline but now looking back on that you
know what they're actually pretty damn
good I don't mind purchasing their
brushes with my own money but if they
were to contact me again I was
definitely not mine trying out more of
their brushes making you guys my honest
thoughts so yeah definitely left me and
each cosmetics and then I'll see
favorably known cruelty-free I feel like
I mean unlike morphe brushes I've talked
about that before not if you have a 14-8
that but I do like their brushes and
some of them are vegan and I see some of
the armor will be free but for the most
part i guess i would be working up with
Max brushes and things like that I just
have so many brands of brushes that are
not cruelty free I really need to do
like a brush declutter video and flash
this video I'll do a tune those big eyes
makeup brush collection and declutter
2017 let me know if you want to see that
down below all right the next question
is from like with Michelle 29 have you
found any over-the-counter products that
help with your scalp problems
so see a little bit so if you guys
turned out I had really bad epidermal my
beautiful installed scoring on at my
scalp on specifically this year with my
lupus so uh yeah I really haven't found
anything over the counter that super
helpful besides like oils I was just
highly highly recommend going ahead and
using oils on yourself all the way with
great auto oil I relief you like cactus
oil which helps with hair loss as well I
definitely get a lot of hair shedding
and Carole Longson things like that what
was it Dan it is what it is you know
it's one of those things where I'm not
really going to dwell on it anymore I
have lost my whole entire head up here
before from lupus and I'm just happy
right now that I still have some hair
see I've definitely recommend oils but
over-the-counter treatments now alright
so let's be here the next one is from
kami around for you but first I do want
to go ahead and go in with my voice
riser so my skin is nice and clearly
stamped right now I've noticed that if i
put my moisturizer on when my skin is
still slightly damn it actually sinks in
better so this is the revlon eternit
when t7 moisture cream with projection I
don't think the ingredients in here are
that healthy and even know what the
health or Jenna today is I'm going to
take a little bit like this and I am
just going to massage this into my skin
it is a very very basic cream it smelled
um and smells like my grandma and a lot
of people will be like to Randy's
mountain no i mean like it actually
smells really beautiful i love hope my
grandma I love the way that she smells
so anyways having very old-school kind
of fragrance to it if you don't like
that and we're not like this I didn't
even know if they sell this anymore but
I noticed a difference in my skin I know
a lot of people that are older say that
they noticed a huge difference in their
skin or they have been using it for
years and they look like they're like 25
which is awesome but Revlon does test on
animals so I won't be repurchasing just
a bit sitting in my collection quite
some time now so I just want to use it
up it doesn't have any sort of 80s
ourselves without fit or beige beige
than that which is great because I can
handle that right now all right way back
to the next one is like I said in some
kami roundtree did I say that you
requested you to 184 absolute favorite
facial cleanser and you would only have
random mascara what would it be one
brand of mascara before I like cold III
I feel like I would say I feel like
covergirl and also maybe we can have
really business doing mascaras but now
that i am cruelty-free we're trying to
go Rosie Korea um I don't even know i do
not have some really does not terribly
love the audacious mascara so maybe that
i like they only have one though that's
a really good question but if i could
just choose and not like look at it any
cruelty-free aspect i would say me
bullying and probably cover girl say
it's a super sizer the sephora watchin
have the outrageous pearl which is one
of my favorites I just feel like a lot
of brands the test on animals have some
really good stuff which is unfortunate I
really feel like I need to stop
mentioning them as much because I don't
want to be promoting that on my channel
but also if you happy you know I should
all be baited to also tell you guys if I
do enjoy eight products a lot of you
don't want to be cruelty-free and that
is one hundred percent okay i am not
somebody who's ever going to push that
on you and so I do feel like the product
side you have my collection that are not
cruelty free i still will go ahead and i
let you guys know if I like that anyways
okay i guess i would say who i want to
say no I feel like the our dishes master
is great urban decay make some good
master they have a subversion lash
primer as well or minus K is equal to
three brand they are owned by a parent
companies that test on animals but for
the most part they themselves are
cruelty free from yeah I don't know it's
a bit of a tricky question for big daddy
alright and then the last one and look
go ahead and make this the last one just
you from a quarry hi well I think this
is ten questions so that should be good
if you ask them what they doin you
before these before at Rose cleansing
wipes that are cozy free that is such a
good question i'm actually working on it
right now and i did recently pick some
ways up from inst of a guy and i am
hoping really really hoping that they
are going to be a soup they really smell
similar to the product and I think these
are new light on the mat ulka but yeah I
think they're knew about me they are new
but i think they are pretty much going
to be kind of
so I want you guys know I'm still not
one hundred percent so let me do a
little more a little more work with them
I noticed that the actual catalysts are
a lot thinner than these are 40 ones but
I will find you guys some sort of
approach seyfried you still worried so
anyway guys that is pretty much is all
I'm going to do now is put on my peugeot
at last activator gel serum for at my
eyelashes and then i'm also going to
brush my teeth which is by weight combat
musn't for Christmas you guys up since
it is the opus nine years over here it
is the song here in the rose gold how
beautiful is that I love it so it has
people travel case we got a new brush my
teeth and I put some of my boom-boom
cream on top like and my thighs and then
just pretty much in some ice cream as
well oh yeah so thank you so much you
