my channel today I do have a Q&amp;amp;A for you
guys this is going to be Q&amp;amp;A number five
as well as a little bit of a gift I'm
ready with me I am obviously still in
Hawaii I got really pretty bad sunburn
today can you guys see this this is
pretty darn bad yeah I got some summer
and I thought I'd go ahead and just get
not ready with you guys
show you guys what I'm going to use on
my skin to help kind of cool and calm it
down but yeah I also wanted to go ahead
and answer questions while I do it I am
filming this on my laptop there really
just is an 80 good camera to film with a
while I'm gone
honestly I filmed the room tour on my
phone I'm filming this one on the laptop
like I said because I want to have the
questions pulled up right next to me as
well as just be able to like I know I
kind of show up like completely in frame
it's very hard to describe but my new
camera is kind of crazy
it really zooms in on my face so I do
plan on playing with that and working
with it when I get home but just for now
I thought I would go ahead and you Avery
chillax kind of get ready with me and
also I'm sorry get ready with me and Q&amp;amp;A
so anyway let's go ahead and jump right
into it I have already taken off all of
the sunscreen that I was wearing earlier
and things like that so the first thing
I wanted you is take this Tarte friction
stick this is just a really I don't know
why I've been doing this no autofocus
but this is basically just an
exfoliating cleanser and I am going to
go ahead and apply this on to my actual
face now you can apply this on to dry
skin or on wet skin if I really really
want a nice exfoliation I like to put it
on dry skin if I want just a little bit
of exfoliation I will go ahead and put
it on a damn skin but I'm just putting
that all over and then I'm going to take
a washcloth a damp washcloth and I'm
going to massage in circular motions to
kind of get this cleanser going and
really make sure that it does exfoliate
my face so let's go ahead and jump into
the Q&amp;amp;A you guys like I said I have done
quite a few of these so if I did not
answer your question that you asked on
Instagram I will you know link those
videos down below because they probably
have already been answered alright so
the first question comes from Emily
e-beam and she said what are your
recommendations for clearing that acne
and what is your all kind of favorite
and makeup
so I would start with the ladder my
all-time favorite makeup brand is a
two-faced I've been having a little bit
of a hard time with Too Faced lately but
they are my all-time favorite makeup
brand and as far as recommendations for
clearing up acne are concerned I do
think that there are just some
ingredients that you should look into
the first one at being retinol and you
may think that retinol is one of those
products that is just used for
anti-aging it is not it is one of those
products that also is really great or I
should say retin-a is really really
great for clearing up acne benzoyl
peroxide is also fantastic and so a
cèlle silik acid if you have really
really big kind of painful hormonal
pimples I get those along my jaw line
and have secured on my chin you probably
want to go with benzoyl peroxide just
because it's really gonna knock them in
the ass but if you want it dirty people
aren't if you have skin that just has
tiny little breakouts like those little
superficial under the skin a sort of
bumps I think style silic acid would be
great so that's kind of my
recommendation is looking into those
kind of ingredients all right the second
question it comes from let's see here
Vanessa B and she asked would you do a
boyfriend does my voiceover challenge so
a lot of you have been asking this since
Tom obviously doesn't want to come on
camera he's just not ready yet uh but
yeah I've asked him and he said I don't
know maybe so we'll see about that I'm
not quite sure I'm leaning more towards
probably not but if we ever have time
then we decide to film one I obviously
will get that up for you guys alright so
this is kind of as you guys can see you
know made my face a little bit red it is
an exfoliating cleanser so what I'm
gonna do is just go ahead and pat dry my
face Oh probably couldn't hear me pat
dry my face it just feels super super
nice and clean now I do you think this
is kind of a cool product I just don't
like the pack I love the packaging
because it's compact but at the same
time I don't because the actual stick
does get kind of yucky but this does
have charcoal in it and if you are back
to the first question if you are someone
who does deal with breakouts I would
highly recommend looking into charcoal
as well alright so speaking of charcoal
I am going to go in with a mass this is
the origins clear improvement active
charcoal mask and
I'm just gonna apply a little bit of
this mostly concentrating in my t-zone
and not so much around the areas where
I'm super super sunburned but I have
been wearing a lot of sunscreen so
sunscreen no matter what makes me break
out like even the new one that I got you
guys the Neutrogena one it makes me
break out so I like to always have some
sort of a mask that will decongest my
pores when I travel and I am using a lot
of sets fading so just kind of putting
that in my t-zone and then I will let
that sit for a few minutes but yeah okay
the Vanessa yes the answer in finesses
question some yeah maybe about to be
boyfriend does my voiceover will see as
probably not do you guys know he's very
very busy and out so he's just a little
camera shy and that's okay
alright number three is from jnz if you
had your own brand what would you do
makeup jewelry skincare or clothing I
think I would do skincare you guys I
absolutely love love love skincare so
yeah I'm gonna have to go with skincare
the next one is from a nursery prime and
they asked what's the most difficult
thing about being a beauty youtuber I
feel like the most difficult thing is
just having to sometimes a deal with
other Beauty youtubers I know that
sounds absolutely horrible but YouTube
is a very very kind of competitive place
and when you start kind of making
friends or making like connections in
the YouTube world you start to notice
that not everybody is super nice so I
would say that's really difficult other
than that I feel like filming is quite
easy for me personally obviously I don't
edit or anything so filming is good and
easy for me I just really enjoy being on
YouTube I really like making the videos
that I make and yeah I would say that's
probably the most difficult thing the
second one mean typing in the
description box that is the pain in the
ass
alright the next question is from
Jessica rhymer how did you get into the
professional world of music so I
basically got into it because I was
raised around it so my mom was a viola
she did get her Bachelor of Music degree
like I did and then she actually turned
out to be a ballerina in the end she
completely switched her fields just
because she can do stuff like that she's
awesome
but yeah I feel like I was just kind of
grew up around it so you definitely make
connections and I can link them
my connections are in New York and
Houston Minneapolis obviously I grew up
in Minneapolis went to college in New
York and I just feel like when you are
in the professional world you just want
to make sure you have those connections
so that you can reach out to people so
yeah all right the next one is from B K
Roth how did you meet Tom I've talked
about this before we met on eHarmony all
right the next one is from Lizzie Benzie
what are your favorite cruelty free and
non cruelty free of makeup brushes so I
would say cruelty free probably BH
Cosmetics I really like their brushes
most of them are vegan I don't think all
of them are by the way this little
washed off the damp on it that I used
for the charcoal exfoliating cleanser I
am going to use this to remove this mask
now I'm not leaving it on my skin for
too long just because I have been a
little red in the face obviously and you
know charcoal can be a little it really
can pull things out so I don't want to
be too rough in the areas where I'm a
little more red
so anyway I'm just kind of doing that in
circular motions but yeah cruelty free
so cruelty free definitely like I said
probably BH Cosmetics I also really like
lux eat brushes lumpy has really kind of
taken off recently I feel like first it
was Sigma then it was morphe now it's
Lexi but I actually like Lexi like I
stand by their brushes I think they're
actually really really fantastic and
yeah I remember them reaching out to me
a few months ago and asked me if I
wanted to try some of their brushes out
at the time I didn't know what the brand
was actually and I declined but not
looking back on that I'm like you know
they're actually pretty damn good I
don't mind purchasing their brushes with
my own money but if they were to contact
me again I would definitely not mind
trying out more of their brushes and
give you guys my honest thoughts so yeah
definitely Lexi and Beach cosmetics and
then I'll take favorite like non cruelty
free I feel like I mean I like morphe
brushes I've talked about that before
I'm not if you should be on a 4 if you
make that but if you like their brushes
and some of them are vegan and maybe
some of them are cruelty free but for
the most part I guess I would say morphe
and also like Mac brushes and things
like that I just have so many brands of
brushes that are not cruelty free I
really need to do like a brush declutter
video and collection video I'll do a
tune going fee base makeup brush
collection and declutter 2017 let me
know if you want to see that down below
the next question is from life with
Michele 25 have you found any
over-the-counter products that help with
your scalp problems associated with
lupus so if you guys didn't know I have
had some really bad epidermal I think
that's what it's called scarring on at
my scalp specifically this year with my
lupus so uh yeah I really haven't found
anything over-the-counter that super
health will be sites like oils I would
just highly highly recommend going ahead
and using oils on yourself olive oil is
great
avocado oil I really do like cactus oil
which helps with hair loss as well I
definitely get a lot of hair shedding
and hair loss and things like that was
good this Ana it just is what it is you
know it's one of those things where I'm
not really gonna dwell on it anymore I
have lost my whole entire head of hair
before from lupus and I'm just happy
right now that I still have some they
are so yeah I would definitely recommend
oils but over-the-counter treatments No
alright let's see here the next one is
from cami Roundtree but first I do want
to go ahead and go in with my
moisturizer so my skin is nice and kind
of like damp right now I've noticed that
if I put my moisturizer on when my skin
is still slightly damp it actually sinks
in better so this is the Revlon Eterna
27 moisture creams with pro Janet in I
don't think the ingredients in here are
that healthy I don't even know what the
helper gelatin is I'm going to take a
little bit like this and I'm just going
to massage this into my skin it is a
very very basic cream it smells um it
smells like my grandma and a lot of
people will be like oh Grammys not no no
no I mean like it actually smells really
beautiful I love I love my grandma and I
love the way that she smells so anyway
just has a very old-school kind of
fragrance to it if you don't like that
you would not like this I didn't even
know if they sell this anymore but I
didn't notice a difference in my skin I
know a lot of people that are older say
that they notice a huge difference in
their skin or they have been using it
for years and they look like they're
like 25 which is awesome but Revlon does
tests on animals so I'm gonna be
repurchasing this is been sitting in my
collection for quite some time now so I
just wanted to use it up it doesn't have
any sort of a cheese ourselves look out
separate base shades in it which is
great just because I can't handle all of
that right now alright anyway back to
the next question like I said is from
Cammie Roundtree did I say that guy
our question is what is your absolute
favorite facial cleanser and if you
could only have one brand of mascara
what would it be one brand of mascara
before I went cruelty free I feel like I
would say I feel like covergirl and also
maybe we can have really really good
mascaras but now that I am cruelty free
or trying to go cruelty free um I don't
even know I feel like NARS has some
really good masters I love the audacious
mascara so make me that I feel like they
only have one though that's a really
good question but if I could just choose
and not like look at it in a cruelty
free aspect I would say Maybelline and
probably covergirl because they have the
super sizer the Sephora collection has
the outrageous curl which is one of my
favorites I just feel like a lot of
brands that test on animals have some
really good stuff which is unfortunate I
really feel like I need to stop
mentioning them as much just because I
don't want to be promoting that on my
channel but also I do have the you know
I should I'm obligated to also tell you
guys if I do enjoy product a lot of you
don't want to be cruelty free and that
is 100% okay I am NOT somebody who's
ever gonna push that on you so I do feel
like the products that you do have my
collection that are not cruelty free I
still will go ahead and I will let you
guys know if I like that but anyway so
yeah I guess I would say ooh I want to
say NARS I feel like the audacious
mascara is great
Urban Decay makes some good mascaras
they have the subversion lash primer as
well Urban Decay is a quality free brand
they are owned by a pyrimidine that
tests on animals but for the most part
if they themselves are cruelty free so
yeah I don't know it was a bit of a
tricky question for me Gabi
alright and then the last one let's go
ahead and make this the last one this is
from a quarry honey well I think this is
ten questions so that should be good and
she asked them what they could do before
these Sephora Rose cleansing wipes that
are cruelty free that is such a good
question I'm actually working on it
right now and I did recently pick some
wipes up from Pacifica and I am hoping
really really hoping that they are going
to be a doob they really smell similar
to the product and I think these are new
I found them at Ulta
but yeah I think they're do I mean they
are new but I think they are pretty much
gonna be kind of a dupe so I will let
you guys know I'm
still not 100% so let me do a little
more a little more work with them I
noticed that the actual tablets are a
lot thinner than these Sephora ones but
I will find you guys some sort of a
cruelty-free dupe don't worry so anyway
guys that is pretty much it all I'm
going to do now is put on my cargo lash
activator gel serum for of my eyelashes
and then I'm also going to brush my
teeth which by the way Tom got me this
for Christmas you guys look at this it
is the OH
it's not here it's over here it is the
Sonicare in the rose gold how beautiful
is that I love it so it has this cute
little travel case but yeah I'm going to
brush my teeth I'm going to put some of
my boom-boom cream on top and my thighs
and then uh yeah I think that's pretty
much it some eye cream as well
Ann yeah so thank you so much you guys
for joining me for this more like Chetty
get unready with me QA I hope you guys
did enjoy it and I will see you tomorrow
