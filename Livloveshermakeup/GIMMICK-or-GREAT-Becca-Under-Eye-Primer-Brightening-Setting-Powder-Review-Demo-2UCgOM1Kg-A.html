my channel I am currently a make up a
free because I have a review and demo
for you guys today this is going to be
on the new at Becca under eye primer as
well as the brightening setting powder
one of these products I really like the
other one I do not like so let's go
ahead and read a little bit of
information about first of all the anti
fatigue under eye primer because that is
my favorite out of the bunch and this
retails for $32 you do get 3 point 7
grams of product in here it is a cooling
anti fatigue
eye bomb and primer in one is that
prepped the skin for smooth that makeup
application it's that's what it does the
coverage can only go so far the priming
ball smooths and blurs the look of fine
lines while reducing puffiness around
your orbital bone ooh how fancy infused
with cucumber and matcha green tea and
caffeine the sheer and velvety texture
effortlessly melts into the skin to
condition the eye area it perfectly
preps the under eyes for corrector and
concealer application so makeup and
never creases or looks cakey it also
says that you can apply this throughout
the day to help with any sort of
creasing even though it tells you that
you won't have concealer creasing but
still I tried it that way and it did not
work now this is formulated without
parabens sulfates and theta lays and it
is cruelty free if you guys are curious
if this is what the packaging looks like
as you can see it's basically just
acrylic packaging kind of reminds me of
like they're lush lip color bombs from
far away it looks pretty fancy but then
when you actually get it you're like
it's not that fancy
it's plastic now it does have a blue
color to it which is kind of a
counterproductive or go super sorry
because you would think that putting
blue underneath your blue circles and
eath your eyes would make them look even
more blue but this really does go ahead
and actually just go on completely
invisible and it basically just you
can't see anything once you have it on
now as far as the brightening under eye
setting powder is concerned you get only
2.7 grams of product in here for $25 it
is a targeted of Britney and setting
powder for a lasting and makeup where
they say you can use it pretty much
anywhere but it is a meant to be used
underneath the eyes although it is
brightening it does not have any sparkle
or sheen it to it however I feel like
this is a very very basic silica powder
you literally can dupe this very easily
and I will show you guys what you can do
bit with it says this weightless
invisible loose powder brightens and
sets
I make up for a lasting we're infused
with light reflecting pearl powders that
instantly blurs the appearance of fine
lines without settling into them again
formulated without parabens sulfates and
satellites fatal aids satellites
you guys know what I'm trying to say so
here's what the packaging looks like and
nothing spectacular pretty darn basic
you do open it up and as you can see the
sifter is really really loose so if you
ever do have problems with getting a
product out into the lid you're not
gonna have that problem with this guy
right here
so as far as the anti fatigue eye primer
is concerned I'm actually really really
enjoying it one of the reasons why I
called this a gimmick or great reveal
it's because I personally felt like this
was either going to be incredibly
gimmicky or it was going to be great and
honestly I think it's great it's one of
those really strange textures or it
almost feels like like the Natalie face
defender or something that's really
really silicone like but almost turns to
a powder I think that's how Emily Noel
83 described it the other day as well
when she was talking about dupes and I
do want to say really quickly I agree
with Emily on a lot of different things
but I do personally have the elf
hydrating stick as well as the hard
candy hydrating stick and for me I feel
like this does more so I don't really
have a dupe for this particular product
but I do it for this setting powder now
it almost goes to like a powder finish
and like Emily said you would think that
when you put that underneath your eyes
it would look drying and it just really
wouldn't do anything however I feel like
it really does smooth out my under-eye
throughout the day a lot of people seem
to think creasing and settling into fine
lines and wrinkles throughout the day is
the same sort of thing creasing is when
your concealer actually starts to build
up and you can see breaks within the
concealer we're settling into the fine
lines is where you can see the dark
lines where you have fine lines so I
feel like a lot of people make a mistake
and say oh my god it's the same exact
thing and it really is not if you
already do have the beginnings of fine
lines and wrinkles underneath your eyes
no matter what unfortunately I do too
there are going to be there is going to
be a little bit of settling a with
concealer however I feel like this does
help with creasing throughout the day
you tried it with numerous different
concealers I have tried it too with
heart shape tape which you guys know I'm
trying to use up currently I have tried
it with a few drugstore concealers as
well as high-end concealers and
it
lead us make even concealers I'm not a
huge fan of look really really nice
underneath my eyes now we'll say you
have to be very careful because if you
are using an eye primer and then you go
in with this underneath before you go in
with your actual concealer this can
start to peel just a little bit because
it's very silicone like so if you are
going in with an eyelid primer that's
very very tacky this might start to peel
and build up a little bit so what I like
to do is once I have a cleaner face I go
ahead and I put my eye primer on then I
do my face primer and then I will take a
little bit of this balm or rub it
together with my fingers and Pat it
right underneath my eyes and really you
guys I don't know how but it does help
with crazy and it really does help with
creasing throughout the day like I said
it's kind of like a silicone slip sort
of consistency and I feel like the more
that you put on the better the under eye
actually look so for me I do not just
put on one layer I've usually put on
about two to three I need one of you
comments on an Instagram post yesterday
saying you know it really feels like
you're not putting anything on yet my
concealer is not creasing throughout the
day and it's like that it's like a
magical product where you put it on and
you really don't think it's gonna do
much or you can't really feel it but
then it does so I feel like it's really
kind of putting a smooth layer right
there that's not too powdery kind of
like the benefit Porefessional it has a
little bit of moisture and a little bit
of tact so that your concealer is not
slipping throughout the day and it
really is just sitting right on top
which is what you want so overall I
would say that this is a keeper and I
would definitely go ahead and purchase
this I will go ahead and try and find a
dupe for you guys but so far I have not
been able to find anything that's
similar to this now a lot of people were
saying if it has cucumber extract and
all these sort of things in it why isn't
it cooling they do say that you can pop
this into the fridge so if you want a
really cooling experience that is great
and I have not tried it that way but I'm
sure that also would help a little bit
with puffiness so really it really do
like this guy now as far as the under
eye setting powder is concerned this is
just a basic bitch kind of product I'm
not going to return it I will use it I
like to go ahead and set my under eye
with it as well as my fine lines and
wrinkles around my mouth and also right
here on at my forehead and now
I feel like you can definitely find
something very very very similar to this
for a fraction of the price the product
I'm talking about is the elf HD setting
powder any sort of silica powder they
bye-bye under-eye I'm sorry the bye-bye
pores are from it cosmetics anything
that you have like the by teary Hydra
powder but the cheapest alternative you
can find is the elf powder and it has a
full like 5 grams of product in it so
again this doesn't have any sparkle or
anything like that but I do feel like
other powders set my under-eye better
I think the standout product and the one
that you'll want to go ahead and pick up
out of the two is definitely this one
right here but it is kind of nice I will
say if you are going in and you put your
foundation and concealer on first like I
do and then you do your eye makeup and
say you get a lot of fallout and you
kind of dust it off but there's still a
little bit of Darkness there this is
nice we're going in and kind of sweeping
away the color and it will brighten it a
little bit but it's really nothing
special not anything that I would
recommend you guys pick up for that
price tag so anyway let's go ahead and
jump into the live demo all right so I
am starting a with clean skin that has
been you know moisturized I put in
essence on tone or a emulsion
all the good stuff because I love skin
care I'm gonna go ahead and go into the
anti fatigue eye of primer and I really
like to warm it up with my finger and
then I like to tap it right underneath
my eye and I know people say use your
ring finger and don't be so
harsh and blah blah blah blah blah but
bitch what I am you know on the go in
the morning I mean this is what I do so
I go like this and sometimes I look up
so I can really get into all those
little tiny
fine lines and wrinkles because this
will help to plump them a little bit but
like you know you can't fully get rid of
those ever and then I go in usually with
a second layer because the first layer
never feels like it does anything
because this is a really really
lightweight product and again just going
ahead and tapping alright and I really
make sure I go to the SF or I would say
the orbital bone right here because when
I smile I get these little lines right
here so I make sure that that is all
taken care of alright now I'm going to
go ahead and jump into what my concealer
the concealer I'm using today is from
Milani it is the retouch a plus erase
concealer and the shade that I wear is
0-2 light so I'm just going ahead and
applying that right
my eyes and I will go ahead and blend
this in with a brush actually you know
what no for the sake of this video why
don't I blend it in with my finger so
you guys can see because I know some
people say well I never blend in my
concealer with a brush or with a sponge
so for the sake of this I will blend it
in with my finger I'm just tapping and
I'm gonna take a little bit on my eyelid
as well since I do put concealer there I
don't use concealer as eye primer I use
eye primer and then go in with concealer
I could use all the help when it comes
to eyeshadow is kind of creasing
throughout the day on my lid that's a
whole nother story
I have tried at the balm on my eyelid
but I didn't do much I really just like
it for underneath the eyes so I am just
tapping this in just you guys can see
how easy it actually is with your
fingers if I was smart I'd go ahead and
do one side with each but I feel like
everybody has fingers and even if you do
apply your concealer like this hopefully
you can see how nicely it goes on now I
do really love this concealer you know I
should have done one eye with a
different concealer I'm sorry guys Jesus
I'm just all over the place but this is
how it looks after I kind of blend it in
with my finger which I never do usually
when I blend concealer in with my finger
it never looks good so the fact that
this looks okay is amazing
now we're gonna jump into the
brightening setting powder my favourite
brush were applying this is definitely
at my Real Techniques a setting a brush
it looks a little something like this
and it is a dirty here is the powder
which is messy as so I take a
little bit and I put it into the lid and
then I tap off the excess and I apply it
underneath my eyes as well as on my eye
lid but like I said I do prefer other
powders there we go so I'm just gonna
take this and I just push it right
underneath and quite a few times this
past week I have actually gone ahead and
just blended the concealer in with my
fingers and then gone in with the brush
and like I said normally that does not
work for me you can even see the
difference between my eyelid and my
under eye where I put the primer versus
where I put my eye primer it's like a
little more chunky up here I just feel
like usually when you do put concealer
on it's hard with your fingers but for
the sake of the review I wanted to show
you guys that this really does make
things look
and smooth under there and you can
actually just apply your concealer with
your finger that's how smooth the
under-eye will work or look so you can
already see right here where I applied
my eye primer just looks a little more
chunky not as pretty so that is it for
the powder like I said you're not going
to be able to see much of a difference
but sigh yeah I will now go ahead and
apply my foundation and all that kind of
stuff but this is pretty much what it
looks like I used a lightweight
concealer I used the under eye primer as
you guys can see there's no when I go
like this you can't see little lines you
can't see little areas where it's
starting to sink in and that was
blending with my fingers my preferred
and that set of application is with a
sponge but I just wanted you guys to be
able to see how nice and smooth this
really does go on so I hope you guys
enjoyed this review and demo thank you
so much for joining me and I'll see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
