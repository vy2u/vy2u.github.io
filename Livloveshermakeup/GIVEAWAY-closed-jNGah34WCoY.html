for a huge 70,000 subscriber giveaway
which will be for two people and this
one is also a two person a giveaway it's
international it's open to everybody as
long as you're subscribed to my channel
but I don't know I just feel like it's a
new year - will give away some cool
right so let's go ahead and jump right
into it guys all you have to do is let
me know down below if you want prize
number one or prize number two and then
I will go ahead and I will leave the
name of the winner in the description
box in two weeks so basically two weeks

the description box like I said this is
international and I will contact you
directly from my live loves her makeup
at gmail.com email so anyway the first
little prize we have here is the bite
Beauty the perfect bite a moose a Boosh
lipstick set and this has four different
a boost boost lipsticks in it I did
review this this year I love it it's a
great little set and they will also win
the honest tossing of Beverly Hills lip
color palette which I know not everybody
is a huge fan of but I really truly love
this palette and as long as you are
careful with it and you tap off the
excess and you make sure that you're
being careful and just kind of you know
taking your time with this palette I
really think a lot of you would like it
and then they will also win the Becca a
place key glow face palette which again
was a favorite of mine of for the
holiday collection for 2017 and then the
second winner is going to win the Urban
Decay heavy metals palette this is
filled with a bunch of foiled eyeshadows
now because it is just foiled eyeshadows
in here I thought I'd also toss in the
Coastal Scents revealed matte to palette
so that you can pair together the mattes
with the shimmers and then finally they
will be also winning at the anastacio
Beverly Hills Nicole Guerrero glue kit
so three products each to definitely let
me know down below which one you want to
be entered in for and like I said I will
